appears to be on the rise in the @entity3 , and in the search for explanations researchers have begun to scrutinize fetal exposure to a wide range of toxins , including lead , tobacco , pesticides , and chemicals such as pcbs			0
@entity14 , a metal that affects the nervous system , is among the latest suspects to be investigated			0
and in a new study , researchers report that children who are exposed to higher levels of mercury in the womb are more likely to exhibit attention problems , hyperactivity , and other adhd symptoms when they 're 8 years old			1
the study included roughly 600 mothers and children from @entity29 , @entity30			0
the researchers measured prenatal mercury exposure by analyzing samples of the mothers ' hair shortly after birth , and found that a child 's risk of @entity1 symptoms increased by 40 % to 70 % past a certain exposure threshold ( 1 microgram per gram )			1
the association was seen primarily in boys , which was n't unexpected , since previous research has shown that boys seem to respond differently than girls to chemicals that disrupt the endocrine system			0
@entity0 : what causes adhd ? 12 myths and facts " this study and one other recent study -- which both implicate prenatal mercury exposure [ in ] the development of @entity1 -- suggest that the impact of mercury is much greater than previously recognized , " says dr. @entity52 , @entity53 , a professor of children 's environmental health at @entity56 , in @entity57 , @entity58 , and the author of an editorial accompanying the new study			1
the other recent study , which was conducted in @entity70 children in @entity71 and published earlier this fall , produced similar results : children who were exposed to higher prenatal levels of mercury ( as measured by samples of umbilical - cord blood ) were more likely to exhibit adhd symptoms between the ages of 8 and 14			1
the new study , which appears in the @entity79 , looks only at adhd symptoms , rather than official diagnoses			1
and it shows only an association , not a cause - and - effect relationship			1
that said , it would be difficult to design a mercury - exposure study more rigorous than this one , since for ethical reasons pregnant womencould not be selectively exposed to high levels of mercury , which is known to be toxic to the developing fetus , says dr. @entity92 , @entity53 , a pediatric neurologist at @entity93			1
@entity0 : food additives that may affect @entity1 aside from on - the - job exposure ( which is common in mining and certain types of manufacturing ) , people are most likely to be exposed to mercury by eating fish that have ingested the metal in contaminated waters			1
this is why the @entity105 recommends that pregnant women eat no more than two six - ounce servings of low - mercury fish per week			2
in the study , however , fish consumption was not independently related to @entity1 symptoms			1
in fact , when the authors conducted a second analysis among the same group of mothers and children , they found that the offspring of mothers who reported eating more than two servings of fish per week while pregnant actually had a 60 % lower risk of adhd symptoms			1
how to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings ? one possibility is that the nutritional benefits of fish may offset the harmful effects of mercury , the authors suggest			0
fish is a good source of omega - 3 fatty acids , healthy fats that are essential to brain development , @entity92 says			0
@entity0 : quiz : do you have adult adhd ? " it 's possible to eat fish low in mercury and high in nutritional value , and it 's possible to eat fish high in mercury and low in nutritional value , " says dr. @entity139 , @entity53 , the senior author of the study and an assistant professor of medicine at @entity143 , in @entity144			2
" what really matters is the kind of fish you 're eating			0
" but @entity139 and her coauthors had no information on what type of fish these women ate			0
and even if they did , there 's no reliable way to estimate which fish are high in mercury and which are n't			2
as a general rule , a fish 's mercury content depends on the size of the fish ( larger fish tend to contain more mercury ) , where it was caught , and how far along it is in its lifespan			0
smaller , oily fishes such as salmon , herring , mackerel , and sardines tend to be low in mercury and yet high in omega - 3s			2
shark , swordfish , and fresh tuna , on the other hand , are more likely to contain high levels of mercury and a relatively modest amount of omega - 3s , though there are exceptions to all of these rules			1
the potential link between mercury and @entity1 will need to be explored further in future studies			2
in the meantime , @entity52 says , avoiding mercury - laden fish is only a short - term precaution			0
a more permanent solution to the contamination problem , he says , will require societies to reduce mercury emissions across the board			0
more adhd news from @entity206			0

adhd symptoms were noted when the children were 8 years old
this research shows associations , not cause - and - effect
fish consumption is not independently related to @entity1 symptoms
shark , swordfish and tuna are more likely to contain high levels of mercury
