editor 's note : @entity2 is the junior senator from @entity3 and the author of a new book , " growing @entity7 roots : why our nation will thrive as our @entity10			1
" sen. @entity2 , @entity11 , says that in the @entity7 , @entity12 are no longer on the outside looking in			1
across @entity7 , the @entity15 population is growing , and it is now the largest minority group in the country			1
latino voices are being heard , and their economic impact is being felt in the marketplace , which is good for the whole of the nation			0
contrary to what may be a popular belief , most @entity12 in @entity7 today are @entity7 citizens			1
many barely live above the poverty line , but many others have entered the ranks of the middle class and are contributing mightily to the culture as well as the economy			0
@entity12 are no longer on the outside looking in			1
they are at the table , making a difference			1
on every major issue before @entity39 and every major issue before the courts , latinos , in larger and larger numbers , are engaged in the debate			2
our nation will thrive as our largest minority flourishes			0
it 's important to remember that , particularly in tough times such as these			0
@entity12 have many role models , and now we have one more : justice @entity50 on the @entity51			1
@entity50 and i grew up at the same time in similar circumstances			0
she was raised in public housing in the @entity55			0
i was raised poor , in a tenement building in @entity57 , @entity3 , the son of @entity60 immigrants			0
my mother was a seamstress ; my father an itinerant carpenter			0
i was the first in my family to go to college			0
i never dreamed that one day , i would be elected as one of 100 @entity7 senators in a country of 300 million people , and be able to cast my vote in favor of the confirmation of an eminently qualified @entity75 judge who lived across the river from that old tenement in @entity57			1
it was a proud moment for me , one i will always remember as a highlight of my time in the @entity81			0
one day , a new generation of young @entity12 will follow in the footsteps of @entity50 and other pioneering public servants			1
they will build on the successes of our community , contribute to strengthening our economy and leave their mark on the community and on our nation			0
being at the heart of the debate , part of the greater @entity7 community , is nothing new for @entity12 in this nation			1
in my new book , i write that it is incumbent on us , as @entity12 , to remind ourselves and the rest of @entity7 about our long presence here and the contribution we have made -- and about how the success of the @entity15 community is important for the success of the entire country			1
latino patriots have served and fought in every war			0
they are artists , dancers , singers , poets and journalists , teachers and scientists			0
more and more @entity12 are becoming entrepreneurs and businesspeople , contributing to the wealth and economic well - being of the nation			1
but they have also been characteristically humble , and have not spoken enough about their accomplishments and the contributions they have already made to the fabric of this nation			1
from the earliest days of the republic -- indeed well before the revolution -- @entity12 have been an integral part of the establishment of this country			1
all @entity7 should have access to that history			2
in politics alone , @entity12 have played a larger role than most realize			2
technically , the first latino in @entity39 was @entity137 , who served briefly from 1822 to 1823 as a delegate from @entity139 before it became a state in 1845			0
@entity142 of @entity143 won by one vote in 1876 to become the first @entity75 member of the @entity39			0
the first @entity75 senator was @entity147 of @entity148 , who served for a short time in 1928 before resigning because of ill health			0
there have been three @entity152 winners from the @entity7 and 11 @entity15 astronauts , and the list goes on			1
we need to enhance the teaching of the story of @entity75 life in @entity7 which will , in the end , shed more light than heat on the immigration debate taking place across this nation			2
latinos themselves need to fully understand and appreciate their accomplishments , but also to understand , as a community , where we have fallen short			1
millions of @entity12 are graduating into the middle class			2
more @entity15 children are going to colleges and universities than ever before			2
@entity12 are increasingly serving in public office and in key areas of the economy			1
but , at the same time , despite this progress in education , too many @entity15 children are dropping out of school			2
too many families are struggling to make ends meet			0
and too many @entity12 suffer from a lack of adequate health care			2
these are the realities , some we can justifiably be proud of			0
others we must honestly confront and address if we are to succeed together as a nation , achieve our full potential and bring the next generation along			0
growing roots in @entity7 means recognizing our past , acting now and preparing the road for those new generations who will follow			1
it means engaging in sweeping efforts to improve education for @entity12 and all @entity7 children , including specific programs to bring along those who have fallen behind in school through no fault of their own			1
it means comprehensive health care , elder care and economic opportunity -- the same rights that all @entity7 want and deserve			2
we must engage and encourage young hispanics to enter public service , to be part of the debate , to be at the table and be part of the solution			1
we must instill in them a sense of history and a belief that it is our duty and obligation to give something back to the community to build a better , stronger nation			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity12 are now are at the political table , making a difference
more young @entity12 will follow in the footsteps of pioneering public servants , he says
he says @entity12 must remind @entity7 about long @entity15 presence , contributions
latinos must appreciate accomplishments but also understand *shortfalls* , he says
