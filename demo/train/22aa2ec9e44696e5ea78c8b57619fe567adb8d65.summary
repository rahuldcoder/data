earlier this month during @entity0 , the @entity2 festival of colors , more than three million @entity5 followers of the @entity2 prime ministerial candidate @entity6 received a personalized greeting from him			1
others received celebratory recorded phone messages that concluded with an appeal to vote			0
in another online campaign , supporters of the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) were urged to donate a tweet or @entity16 status to the newly formed anti-corruption party			1
social media has become the new election battleground for @entity2 's nationwide parliamentary elections , which started monday			1
a bevy of politicians , who , at first sight , seem antiquated and traditional in their flowing kurtas and @entity26 caps are turning to social networking sites to engage @entity29 - savvy first time voters			1
having an official @entity31 channel or an active @entity16 page is now as important as holding mass rallies and plastering candidates ' faces on billboards			1
some are borrowing strategies employed by @entity41 president @entity40 's 2012 presidential campaign , with the use of @entity43 , an online platform which helps to make content viral			0
there are more than 200 million internet users in @entity2			1
most of them are young and mobile urban dwellers			2
this demographic is also socially engaged , making for the highest @entity5 and @entity16 usage in the world , outside of the @entity41 , according to @entity54			1
these numbers might justify the social push by political parties as a persuasion tool			0
however , with large parts of the country still without @entity29 and mobile , the impact of these campaigns on election results remains to be seen			2
social media : the new election battleground in february , @entity6 appeared on a giant screen across tea stalls in the country , with a beloved @entity2 staple in his hand -- a cup of tea			1
this was @entity76 's " @entity75 " ( discussion over tea ) campaign , where satellite and mobile technologies were used to host live interactions with people			2
in this flood of online political campaigning , the @entity76 's strategy has been effective , said @entity87 , founder of @entity88 , an online media agency			0
" they have hired experts and given them full liberty to manage their social media , " he said			0
" some campaigns are not just for promotions , but to create conversations			0
" a @entity16 tracker designed to show how much users are talking about candidates and parties showed more buzz for the @entity76 over rivals			1
but @entity6 is not the only one as scores of political parties have turned to @entity16 interviews , mobile crowd sourcing , or hashtag wars on @entity5			1
activist - turned - politician @entity109 and his @entity12 , which made its debut in @entity112 assembly elections earlier this year , have been using social media to draw swathes of supporters			1
the anti-corruption party has a @entity16 page for every single constituency in the capital			2
a study by the @entity121 estimates this year 's total election spending to reach $ 5 billion -- three times higher than the previous elections in 2009			1
this sum is being compared to the $ 7 billion that the @entity41 spent in its last presidential elections			1
according to a report by the @entity130 ( @entity131 ) , political parties are typically spending 2 to 5 % of their budget on fueling their online presence			2
the social media strategy of the ruling @entity135 does n't appear to be as aggressive			0
at a time when @entity5 has become politicians ' latest fighting weapon , both the party president , @entity139 and her son , @entity26 , 43 , are conspicuous by their absence on the microblogging site			1
many of the party members , however , are active tweeters			0
but one notable campaign by the party has been the wide use of the mobile messaging platform , @entity150 , both for internal communication and relaying party updates			2
@entity153 is helping all political parties with their online strategy by organizing weekly hangouts with politicians			0
in the past , @entity2 's political class mostly interacted with the public only through campaign trails , mass rallies and media interviews			2
the search engine has also developed a dedicated election hub , and a " pledge to vote " interactive map			0
" we wanted to engage with first time voters and inspire different age groups to go out and vote , " said @entity167 , director of marketing at @entity153			1
" we have over half a million pledges so far and they are coming from all parts of @entity2			1
" this trend is largely to do with changing voter demographics			0
out of the massive electorate , more than 20 million are first timers in the age group of 18 and 19			1
will it work ? the @entity131 report estimates there could be a vote swing of 3 to 4 % in 24 states -- states with significant numbers of internet users			0
these could be young men or non-working women who are active social media users			0
however , a major reason for dissent is @entity2 's notoriously weak @entity29 infrastructure			2
most of @entity2 's rural belt still lives in an offline world of sms and faxes			2
a report by @entity197 found rural internet penetration to be just one twelfth of urban penetration rates			0
@entity201 , @entity112 - based independent political analyst , says that with the digital divide in @entity2 , the impact of online campaigns remains constrained			1
" let 's not exaggerate the influence of social media to influence @entity2 society in general , and politics in particular , " he said			2
" one of four people in @entity2 has never used the @entity29 ; they are just beginning to use a mobile			1
the impact , as of now , remains limited largely to urban areas and well - off sections of society			0
" political parties have tried to get past this hurdle in their campaigns by using mobiles to target the rural voters			0
the @entity76 allows potential supporters to sms their voter registration number to receive voting assistance			0
the @entity12 adopted a " missed call " initiative during the @entity112 elections and has continued with it in the run up to the national elections			0
anyone can register as a party member or a volunteer by simply calling a designated number and hanging up after one ring			0
regardless of the reasoned debate around its worth , social media is paving the way for a further " democratization of politics " in the world 's biggest democracy , says @entity87			0
" earlier , elections in @entity2 were governed by either the rich class or the rural poor , " he said			1
" now , even the middle class is interested , and social media is where they can express their opinion and talk			0

according to estimates , @entity2 will spend close to $ 5 billion in the 2014 elections
@entity5 , @entity16 , @entity251 and mobile crowd sourcing are proving vital
more than 20 million are first - time voters between 18 - 19 years
