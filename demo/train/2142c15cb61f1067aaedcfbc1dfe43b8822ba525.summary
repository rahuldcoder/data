conservatives are expressing shock and outrage that the @entity4 administration knew that many people in the individual insurance market would not be able to keep their plans once the @entity8 took effect			1
such shock is not surprising ; overblown outrage is the stock and trade of conservative politics these days			0
but here 's what conservatives wo n't tell you , lest it undermine their theatrics : many insurance plans are shutting down because they do n't meet the higher bar of quality benefits required under @entity8 , and of those people who lose access to their plans , many will pay less and all will have better and more comprehensive options			1
also , with a few exceptions , no one is really noting that this point is n't quite news			0
in 2010 , the fact that certain insurance plans would not be grandfathered into @entity8 because of their inadequate coverage was widely covered by the press			1
it was a given , after all that , if standards for health insurance were going to be raised in @entity41 -- a good thing -- then some plans that do n't meet the bar would no longer be available			1
one could blame this on the @entity8 , or alternatively , one could blame this on insurance companies for providing such substandard care in the first place			2
here 's what this boils down to : will some people lose their current insurance ? yes			2
will these same folks lose health insurance coverage ? no. they will all have access to better plans and in many cases pay less because of expanded options and tax credits			1
this whole kerfuffle ignores that insurance plans were changing all the time and premiums were skyrocketing @entity67			0
suddenly , a whole range of bad behavior on the part of insurance companies is blamed on the @entity8			2
it 's just like employers trying to shaft their workers by cutting hours and benefits and blaming it on the @entity8 , even though employer mandate provisions do n't take effect for another year			1
trying to blame @entity8 for every problem in the private insurance market is paradoxical : the whole reason for passing the @entity8 was to fix what 's broken with private insurance if we as a nation object to the inherent and deeper flaws within the private health insurance system in @entity41 , then we should embrace a single - payer system			1
but instead , because conservatives were so wed to propping up the private insurance market , we got @entity8			1
it 's disingenuous to turn around and point fingers at @entity8 for faults that have always been -- and will always be -- pervasive in private health insurance			1
the @entity8 prevents some of the worst abuses of the private insurance market and makes coverage overall more inclusive and affordable			1
it does n't fundamentally alter the private market equation -- and incentives to cut corners and care			0
i know @entity102 love their manufactured outrage , as much as they loved it back in september 2010 , when @entity102 sen. @entity102 cited the same 40 % to 67 % numbers for those expected to lose plans that @entity107 now reports as " new news			0
" but the fact remains that about 80 % of @entity41 get their health insurance either from their employers or from a program like @entity113 , and that wo n't change at all under the @entity8			2
millions more are uninsured and will be thrilled to have access to affordable insurance at subsidized rates			2
this saves us all money , because the cost of their emergency room care is n't offloaded onto the rest of us in rising premiums			0
what we 're focused on now is the small sliver of @entity41 who , like myself , get insurance through the individual market			0
some of us will see our current plans disappear , but all of us will see our plans upgraded -- with many becoming more affordable			0
when it comes to president @entity4 and his policies , conservatives have a steady supply of manufactured shock			0
but improving the quality and affordability of health insurance for all @entity41 and providing real facts along the way , that 's an important accomplishment .			0

@entity147 : conservatives feign shock that @entity150 knew some plans would be *canceled*
@entity147 : it 's because they do n't meet @entity8 's higher bar of quality benefits
if you lose your plan , she says , you *'ll* have access to better and often *cheaper* plans
@entity147 : most get insurance from jobs ; millions who do n't will get affordable plans
