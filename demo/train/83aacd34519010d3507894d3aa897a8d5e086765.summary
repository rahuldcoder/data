now he sits in front of a computer , sends the photos by e-mail and surfs the @entity56 to research new designs and discover new sales routes such as @entity59			0
he is one of hundreds of craftspeople who have benefited from ongoing workshops organized by the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) 's @entity64			1
using an @entity66 of us $ 9,000 , @entity65 is training everyone from tailors and glass cutters to cotton weavers and furniture makers to download pictures , e-mail , video conference , instant message , use @entity76 and @entity77 , as well as promote their products on @entity6 and @entity79			0
@entity80 , chairman of @entity65 , says : " these artisans had seen computers and heard of the internet but most had never used it or wanted to use it as they did not realize it solved a lot of problems for them			2
" one thing is the cost of buying a computer or laptop ; another is that broadband infrastructure is not as ubiquitous in @entity2 as the @entity32 and it 's costly for the common man			1
" paying a monthly data fee is also costly and they do n't appreciate how it can benefit them			0

" often there is no wired connection in villages as there is not a good return on investment to the @entity136 , " explains @entity127 , a 31 - year - old wireless communications engineer from @entity10 , currently living in @entity129			1
he registered a company , @entity140 ( @entity139 ) wireless communications in october this year , which he hopes will empower @entity2 trapped on the wrong side of the digital divide			1
he plans to use unused spectrum to provide wireless internet free of charge to the digitally disenfranchised in @entity2			1
" @entity146 and @entity147 is an example of spectrum that can already be used for free in secondary mode , " he explains			2

more from @entity40 : @entity160 looks to lead the internet of things the @entity163 ( @entity164 ) in @entity165 with the support of the @entity63 , has already been installing wireless networks in remote tribal regions using wasted spectrum			1
@entity170 founded @entity164 in 2002 after resigning from his position as ceo of a software company three years earlier			0
the 45 - year - old says he realized that " the entire country could leapfrog the developmental cycle if she were to forget about racing for the industrial revolution and aspire for an information revolution instead			0
" " there are two unlicensed bands in @entity2 which can be used by anybody for non-commercial use , " he says			2

" @entity205 is a serious concern in remote areas , but we try to make sure that the supplying nodes are solar - enabled			0
having said that even battery back - up is good enough as nobody in remote areas wants a 24/7 service , " @entity170 adds			0
as for whether efforts should instead be made to provide clean water and electricity first , he says : " that too is a priority			0
but they have not been getting it for several centuries and if they do not join the information bandwagon now they will continue to suffer and be exploited			0
being part of the digital media , they can at least share their grievances			0
" so the @entity230 project is not just about giving the digitally ignorant access to information			0
