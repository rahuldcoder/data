the three choices bring strong party voices from the @entity16 to the new " super committee " charged with crafting a plan to reduce the country 's mounting deficits			1
they join three @entity22 -- @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 -- previously appointed to the committee , as well as six @entity28 fiscal conservatives from the @entity16 and @entity22 named by @entity28 leaders			1

" our entire caucus will work closely with these three appointees toward this goal , which is the goal of the @entity43 people			0
" @entity5 , of @entity44 , is the no. 3 house democrat , while @entity6 , of @entity46 , is vice chairman of the @entity47			1
@entity7 , of @entity48 , is the top @entity49 on the @entity50			1
both @entity5 and @entity7 signaled their commitment to @entity54 values thursday , while @entity6 warned against pre-set conditions by negotiators			1
" too often , the human side gets lost in the @entity0 debates about our nation 's debt and deficits			2
i will seek to keep those interests on the table , " @entity5 said in a statement that noted a widening gap in @entity43 between " those who enjoy great wealth and those who struggle to get by with little thought of ever getting ahead			1
" @entity7 called for the committee to " put jobs first , sharpen @entity43 's competitive edge , ensure health and retirement security , and require shared responsibility from those who have done so well even during these tough economic times , " but @entity6 said that " working in a bipartisan fashion without damaging pre-conditions will guarantee the greatest chance of success			1
" in a letter to the committee members , fiscally consevative @entity22 in the @entity16 urged all the participants to " put politics aside and work across party lines to develop a fair and feasible path to fixing our long - term debt			1
" in separate announcements wednesday , house speaker @entity92 and chose reps			0
@entity95 of @entity96 , @entity97 of @entity98 and @entity99 of @entity98 as the @entity16 @entity28 picks , while @entity22 minority leader @entity100 picked sens. @entity101 of @entity102 , @entity103 of @entity104 and @entity105 of @entity106			0
all six republicans are known for conservative stances on economic issues			0

" the debt crisis is a legitimate threat to our nation 's future , and the @entity43 people can not afford to wait any longer , " @entity95 said in a statement after his appointment			2
" everyone can agree that we must stop spending money we do n't have , and the time to act is now			0
" he added that the committee " will not be able to solve the crisis in a matter of months , but we can work together to tackle these challenges in order to bring back jobs , hope and opportunity for the @entity43 people			1
" @entity103 , despite his credentials of fiscal conservatism , noted wednesday that he recently voted to eliminate the ethanol tax subsidy and believed there were other subsidies or loopholes that could be ended as part of broad tax reform			0
many conservative republicans oppose any moves that could increase taxes			0
" the goal should be to broaden the base and lower rates so that we can create an environment that 's more conducive to economic growth , " he said			0
the committee will follow up on negotiations that started last year with the bipartisan debt commission appointed by president @entity154 , then continued in @entity155 , including work by the so - called @entity158 senators -- three @entity22 and three @entity28			1
both the debt commission and the other group recommended comprehensive packages that included tax reform , changes to politically sensitive entitlement programs such as @entity38 and @entity36 , and spending cuts			2
@entity154 , in a speech at a hybrid car battery plant in @entity98 , called thursday for the committee to take a balanced approach to deficit reduction that ensures major corporations and wealthy individuals are contributing their fair share to a solution			1
" everybody 's got to chip in , " @entity154 said			1
you learn it in kindergarten			0
" former @entity28 sen. @entity181 of @entity182 , who co-chaired @entity154 's debt commission , told @entity1 on wednesday that the new special committee has plenty of information to work with and should n't need a lot of time for further collecting or analyzing of issues			1
committee members " do n't need to sit around here and gather more information , " @entity190 said , adding that the actual negotiating is " going to be tough			2
" among the @entity28 choices , @entity195 is the @entity198 chairman , while @entity99 chairs the @entity199			0
@entity99 has taken some moderate positions in the past , including attempts to decrease tax cuts in the @entity204 administration that remain contentious today			0
in a statement wednesday , @entity99 said that " much more needs to be done to bring down health care costs , promote economic growth and begin to tame runaway government			0
" " no one believes this is going to be easy , " he added			2
on the @entity22 side , @entity101 , the no. 2 @entity28 behind @entity212 , is a staunch advocate for the military , which is targeted for deep spending cuts if the special committee fails to come up with an agreement that passes @entity155 by the end of the year			1
@entity105 is a former @entity16 budget director in the @entity204 administration with a reputation for working with @entity22			0
his fellow @entity106 senator , democrat @entity221 , said wednesday that @entity105 " has shown a willingness to find common ground by looking at both tax reform and spending cuts in order to reduce the deficit			2
" @entity103 , elected to his first @entity22 term last year with the support of tea party conservatives , sits on the @entity232 and @entity231			0
he told reporters wednesday that he expected the special committee to begin its work soon , and that it would require republicans working with @entity22 to succeed			2
" it has to be an exercise in finding common ground between @entity28 and @entity22 , but it also has to be constructive with respect to reducing our deficit and it has to be pro-growth as well , " he said			2
@entity113 went with veteran legislators including a former @entity54 presidential candidate in @entity25 , the @entity246 chairman and the more moderate @entity24 , who chairs the @entity247 and has fought @entity28 efforts to privatize @entity38			0
@entity113 named @entity111 , a war critic and champion of benefits for military veterans , the co-chair of the special committee			2
in a joint statement after their appointments , the three @entity54 senators said that @entity43 want the committee to operate without " the red - hot partisanship and brinkmanship of the last months			1
" " this is not going to be easy			0
our challenge is to find common ground without damaging anyone 's principles			0
we believe we can get there			0
this committee was designed to require bipartisanship , and we are going to work hard with our @entity28 colleagues to attain it , " their statement said			2
the committee will try to work out $ 1.5 trillion in deficit reduction , after an initial round of more than $ 900 billion in spending cuts in the debt ceiling agreement			1
it is required to complete its work by november 23			0
@entity155 then has until december 23 to vote on the proposal , with no amendments permitted			0
a simple majority on the panel -- seven of 12 members -- is needed to approve whatever package it comes up with , meaning that it will take a lone member of either party to push something through by voting with the other side			1
the committee 's proposal would then need a simple majority in each chamber of @entity155 to make it to @entity154 's desk			1
if the committee fails to reach agreement or @entity155 fails to pass whatever package it recommends , a trigger mechanism will enact further across - the - board cuts in government spending , including for the military			1
according to a @entity1 / @entity304 released wednesday , 63 % of respondents say the so - called super committee should recommend increased taxes on higher - income @entity43 and businesses , with 36 % disagreeing			1
by a 57 - 40 % margin , respondents say the committee 's deficit reduction proposal should include major cuts in domestic spending			1
however , further cuts in defense spending get a mixed review , with 47 % favoring them and 53 % opposed			0
nearly two - thirds of respondents oppose major changes to @entity38 and @entity36 , while nearly nine in 10 do n't want any increase in taxes on middle - class and lower - income @entity43			2
months of rancorous negotiations on deficit reduction have failed to resolve a fundamental dispute between @entity28 and @entity22 involving the size of government and whether to raise revenue while cutting spending			1
@entity154 is pushing for a comprehensive plan that includes spending cuts , increased tax revenue and entitlement reforms , while @entity28 seek to shrink government by proposing spending cuts and entitlement reforms without increased revenue			1
an impasse over the tax revenue issue led to the debt ceiling agreement , which imposed the initial round of spending cuts and set up the special committee to work out further deficit reduction			1
the agreement also enables the federal debt ceiling to be increased through 2012 , allowing the government to borrow what it needs to meet its obligations			1
the brinkmanship of the negotiations , with uncertainty over whether the government might default if no deal was reached , was one reason why @entity356 's downgraded the @entity43 credit rating from @entity358 to aa - plus on friday			2
one of the main @entity28 arguments against tax increases for the wealthy is that they would inhibit job creation			0
the poll results showed that only a third of respondents agree with that stance , while 62 % say taxes on the wealthy should be high so the government can use the money for programs to help lower - income @entity43			2
the @entity1 poll was conducted by @entity304 from friday through sunday , with 1,008 adult americans questioned by telephone			0
the survey was conducted both before and after friday night 's announcement of the @entity356 downgrade			0
the poll 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points			0
@entity1 's @entity380 and @entity381 contributed to this report .			0
