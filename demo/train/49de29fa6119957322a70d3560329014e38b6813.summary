-- it was a promise that seemed to owe as much to optimism and sentimentality as reason			0
when the notoriously passionate fans of @entity7 , a small , understated soccer club playing in @entity10 's @entity9 , stood before their team as they took on @entity12 , they unfurled a large banner for the world to see			1
" thank you for all [ our ] friends , " it read			0
" we do not lose until we regain a hometown			0
" yet it is a promise that @entity7 has managed to keep			1
@entity20 , and its football club , were devastated in @entity10 's earthquake and tsunami			1
but since the restart of the @entity10 football league , the unfashionable club has gone on a remarkable run , remaining unbeaten this season with a chance to secure their very first league title in the face of disaster			1
since it began life 23 years ago , @entity7 has led something of a quiet life , spending almost all of its time in @entity10 's second division , before finally wining promotion to @entity10 's top tier in 2009			1
but on march 11 , that all changed			2
when the 9.0 magnitude earthquake unleashed its full power off the northeast coast of @entity10 , @entity20 was one of the places hardest by the subsequent tsunami			1
thousands of people were left dead or missing across the country ; every aspect of life was touched by tragedy , and the city 's football club was no exception			2
its training ground was destroyed and the team 's stadium declared unplayable , deemed to be " in ruins , " according to @entity9 chairman @entity58			1
the @entity9 was suspended , with many calling for it to be cancelled outright for that season			1
" immediately after the earthquake and tsunami we , as a team , wondered if we should , and could , continue to play soccer , " the team 's coach , @entity60 , told @entity0			1
but when the controversial decision was made to restart the league , the players and management decided that they could play an important role in getting the region back up on its feet			1
" we have been determined to be the symbol of hope for the entire @entity76 [ the northeast region of @entity10 's @entity78 island ] and to lead and encourage the reconstruction efforts with our strong performance , " added @entity60			1
after the fans had displayed their banner , @entity7 beat @entity12 2 - 1			1
and they 've kept winning			0
they remain unbeaten and sit just one point off the league leaders @entity88			2
" the biggest job for us was to overcome the shock of devastation and to prepare all the players ready for the matches mentally , " said @entity60			0
one player , the @entity96 striker @entity95 , was so shaken up that he could n't continue and returned to @entity97			0
" the departure of @entity95 was a big blow to the team			0
however , the other players all felt that it could not have been helped as it was due to his family matter and that the gap created by his departure would need to be filled by the rest of the team which led the entire team to a stronger and closer sense of unity , " said @entity60			0
" this united spirit , we believe , is also the key to overcoming the trial of the earthquake and tsunami damages			0
" that @entity7 is even fulfilling fixtures is remarkable enough , but given the club 's underachievement over the years , its unbeaten run is even more impressive			1
" @entity20 has a long history of getting so close to promotion to the @entity9 [ @entity10 football 's top tier ] and could not make it , " explained @entity125 , a writer for @entity10 's @entity127 magazine			1
" they waited , waited , and waited and after seven long years , finally they got promoted ... it 's the people 's club as well			0
there 's one big shareholder but the @entity20 city and @entity141 prefecture own the majority of the shares			2
" people in @entity20 are passionate about sports			2
some follow both baseball and football and it 's quite unusual in @entity10			2
" few would deny that @entity7 would be fitting winners of what has already been an extraordinary @entity9 season			1
there are still 22 league games to play , starting with this week 's match against @entity156			0
" the disaster in @entity20 region has inspired the players , staff , and the entire @entity7 club with great performances and results , " explained @entity157 , the @entity159 - @entity158 coach of @entity156 , who had only been in charge for one game before the march 11 disaster struck			1
" the restart of the league has been important and symbolic of the courage , resilience and fighting spirit of @entity10 people			2
the attendance has been slowly recovering ... if their [ @entity7 's ] results can help the people in the recovery and healing process , this may a great gift of football			2
" @entity157 will be hoping to end that run on sunday , and the club themselves , whose players have been involved in the clean up operation whilst also running football training camp for homeless children , maintain that the championship is a long way away			0
" if we play football , it is a first step towards normality , " said @entity60			0
" as football is a team game , it is a sport where we can demonstrate strength of unity			0
we can inspire spectators with our spirited play and for those dedicated fans our victory would be something special to give them courage in life			0
" but @entity7 's fans who held their hopeful banner against @entity12 back in april will be dreaming of the ultimate fairytale ending			2
after all , a promise is a promise			0
