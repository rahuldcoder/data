-- there are few industries that have n't been shaken up by the game - changing potential of @entity6 printing , and aviation is no exception			1
while it may be fun to imagine manufacturers spitting out planes at the touch of a button , the reality is more low key , though no less revolutionary			0
as is usually the case with aviation , it is all kicking off with a jet engine			0
engine maker @entity19 , a joint venture between @entity21 and the @entity23 company @entity22 , has created the @entity25 engine -- an acronym for " leading edge aviation propulsion " that the company hopes reflects just how innovative the new aircraft component is			1
@entity25 has many futuristic features , including a 3 - d - printed nozzle , the part of the plane responsible for burning fuel			1
" this technology is actually enabling us to create designs that would n't physically be possible to make with standard conventional machining , " said @entity35 , @entity25 's program manager			2

" we can do this in almost any metal you care to choose			0
we can do it in aluminum or nickel or steel			0
this is not @entity6 printing like you might have seen on some tech show where people are making parts from plastic out of their basement			1
this is n't prototyping , where you have to figure out how to make it for real			0
this is making fully functioning production parts out of real aerospace materials , " said @entity67			0
@entity25 incorporates another first ; the engine 's fan blade is made from a material called @entity74			1
essentially , it is ceramic that is as tough as steel , although unlike metal , it can withstand extreme temperatures			2
more important , it is lighter than any alloy previously used			0
the manufacturer says the material used in the fan blades and other components makes a plane 1,000 pounds lighter than normal			1
" @entity25 reduces fuel burn by 15 % over its predecessor engine			1
that adds up to several million dollars saved per year per plane , " said @entity21 spokesman @entity90			2

@entity19 has n't even started ground testing the engine , and they already have 4,500 orders from the likes of @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			2
@entity19 is planning for the engines to go into service by 2016 , which means it needs to produce 1,500 engines a year			0
but the technology makes the goal achievable by cutting manufacturing time			0
" for our most complex parts , it 's common for the time it takes to be measured not only in weeks , but months or even more than a year , " said @entity67			0
" now , we 're talking about going from the computer file to the finished part in hours or days			0
" read more : the dawn of driverless cars @entity93 has also started playing with additive manufacturing			1
@entity123 , of @entity93 's @entity124 , imagines that by 2050 the company will be selling commercial planes made almost entirely from @entity6 printed parts			1
for now , @entity93 is content with making printed brackets , which will become a standard part of production by 2016			2
each component made from @entity6 printing , @entity123 reckons , is 25 percent lighter than the equivalent made from traditional manufacturing			1
" weight reduction is our driving force , because less weight means less fuel , " says @entity123 .			0

a new engine , called @entity25 , incorporates a nozzle made by @entity6 printing
the material used for the fan blades is a tough ceramic that reduces the weight of the plane by 1,000 pounds
@entity21 has acquired companies that *specialize* in direct metal laser *sintering*
@entity93 has also started to *experiment* with additive manufacturing
