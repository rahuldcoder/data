-- as millions prepare to celebrate the @entity4 , her official jeweler has created a three dimensional artwork inspired by her long reign -- and many diamonds			0
@entity8 teamed up with acclaimed light artist @entity9 to create " @entity10 , " an evocative portrait of the monarch which features a real tiara made up of 1,000 diamonds			1
it is based on @entity9 's seminal 2004 @entity10 portrait " @entity18			1
" the tiara is an @entity21 re-creation of the @entity10 's diamond diadem which she wore on the way to her coronation in 1953			1
" we realized that we could collaborate together on this project and create something really unique , " said @entity25 , managing director of @entity21 , which has been supplying the royals with bespoke jewelry and silver ware for the past 225 years			1
the glowing portrait is currently on show to the public at the company 's flagship store in @entity37 , but will be auctioned for charity later this year			1
" we are hoping to raise as much money as possible to go to two charities that have a jubilee focus this year , " said @entity25			0
the tiara 's value is estimated at Â £ 800,000 to Â £ 1.2 million			0
despite the current economic climate , luxury goods remain in demand -- and the tiara is expected to sell at value			2
in part , the luxury market has been protected from the @entity52 downturn by the continued demand out of countries such as @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			2
although many luxury brands remain based in @entity52 , the continent 's purchasing power is under strain as it struggles to emerge from the eurozone crisis			2
according to @entity25 , @entity52 's economic headwinds create challenges , but ones which are offset in part by the popularity of @entity37 and @entity69 as travel destinations			1
that attraction , he said , remains " one of the keys that are driving the growth of the market			0
" @entity25 added : " i think we can all sit here and go ' this is a nightmare ' , but the fact of the matter is there are @entity52 that are still extremely wealthy , and @entity52 who still want to buy the best and it comes down to the individual brands to be able to compete amongst themselves on distinctive design , great quality products , and impeccable service			0
