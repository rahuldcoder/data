-- by now , all have heard the appalling news that storm researchers @entity3 , his son @entity5 and @entity6 lost their lives while studying the tornadic supercell thunderstorm that struck the @entity10 area friday			1
@entity3 and @entity6 were my colleagues and seasoned meteorologists involved in @entity14 , or @entity15 in / near @entity16 , whose mission it is to sample aspects of the environment near tornadoes			2
i 've known them for years			0
i have been involved in storm research and / or the storm chasing community since 1985			1
in this 28 - year span , there had not been a death , and i know of no injuries among meteorologists studying tornadic storms until now			1
it will be several days before the exact circumstances of this tragic loss become clear			0
but even before the storm that ravaged the @entity36 and @entity37 , @entity10 , areas occurred , many questions appeared in the media about storm chasing , or storm observing in the field			1
storm chasing : science , thrill - seeking or tourism ? reducing this issue down to its core , emergency management personnel complain that storm chasers are clogging roads and making it difficult for first responders to reach victims			1
this issue came to a head in @entity54 , @entity55 , on april 14 , 2012 , as an @entity57 - rated tornado approached @entity58			0
whether it is true that storm chasers did indeed impede traffic in that and other cases , it 's clear that the number of chasers out on the roads has dramatically increased in the last decade			1
and some of these people engage in foolhardy and dangerous behavior			0
the question is " why ? " @entity0 photos : professional storm chaser from my perspective , as a professor of meteorology , the term " storm chasing " means what it always has meant to atmospheric scientists who study storms in the field			1
it means interweaving meteorological reasoning and forecasting skills for the purpose of understanding severe thunderstorms in general , and tornadic supercells in particular			2
it 's enough to say that the early forays of meteorologists studying severe storms in the field in the 1960s and 1970s continued into the 1980s and 1990s			1
eventually , their missions split into two tracks			0
on the one hand , in the middle to late 1990s and early 2000s large @entity99 - funded projects such as @entity100 , or @entity101 in @entity102 ; @entity104 , or @entity105 and @entity106 ; @entity14 ; and others involved field efforts bringing many research meteorologists and instrument platforms into the field to surround tornadic supercells or severe thunderstorms			1
i was involved at a minor level in the first and more actively in the second			0
the second track relates to more of what i do as a meteorologist			0
initially , i was drawn to study these storms because they happen in @entity122 , too			2
so , since i am a weather forecaster by training , what better way to understand how weather patterns contribute to the ingredients of severe storms than by immersing myself in a large " inquiry - based " personal research experience ? in my case , bringing this knowledge of ingredients , burned into my psyche by having to forecast them , back to @entity122 has helped meteorologists there understand the patterns that are liable to produce favorable conditions for tornadic supercells			1
other meteorologist chasers have their own set of predetermined goals in observing storms in the field			1
all of us are admittedly united in a fascination with these storms			2
tornado chasers were researchers , not cowboys what is important to note is that no matter what their mission , meteorologists studying storms in the field contribute to the storm - observing process			1
all my colleagues who do this have ways of contacting the @entity165 quickly when tornadoes are forming			0
this has led to an increase in the warning time			2
for example , such observations were a key in preventing injuries and loss of life for the @entity177 , @entity55 , tornado on may 4 , 2007			0
in 1996 , the film " twister " popularized the notion of chasing storms to immerse oneself in a tornado 's circulation			2
the film 's chase teams were loosely based upon the fleets of vehicles called @entity189 in project @entity100 and the early chase forays by the @entity192 and @entity193			0
except it was based upon a fiction : that meteorologists purposefully drive into tornadoes			2
that fiction , i believe , has combined with the trend in society for " extreme " behavior			0
this has encouraged literally hordes of nonmeteorologists -- many of whom who do not understand storm structure or behavior -- carrying cellular phone cameras into the field			1
this extreme behavior is exemplified by cable network programs extolling groups of chasers who drive vehicles that resemble the @entity219 / @entity218 ' spaceship into the path of tornadoes , screaming " tornado , tornado			2
" what does this have to do with friday 's tragedy ? there were many chasers in the field that day			1
a radar plot taken around 6:11 p.m. ct about the time that a multiple vortex tornado was on the ground shows dozens of red dots representing storm chasers or spotters or researchers who were reporting their positions			1
undoubtedly there were many more			0
most of the meteorologists i know who were out in the field that day are represented by the dots south and east of the storm circulation			1
many of them contributed useful information to the @entity165 in the form of eyewitness accounts of the tornado formation , that were not able to be detected by the weather service radars in the @entity10 area			1
some of them were on instrumented vehicles that included mobile doppler radar that also contributed to the excellent warnings issued for that tornado			0
most left the area when the storm 's circulation got so intense that visibility became an issue			0
they also navigated away from @entity10 so as not to clog roads at commute time , or to contribute to the chaos that would develop there if a tornado went into that heavily urbanized area			1
in the coming days , we 'll learn more about the decisions that @entity3 's group made that day			0
it could be that he took some calculated chances and was caught by the rapid northward motion of the tornado			0
it would be a double tragedy if his memory is besmirched by an assumption the he was seeking thrills or personal publicity			0
he was an active researcher contributing to our knowledge			0
but the fact remains that to emergency management personnel a chaser is a chaser , whether he / she is a meteorologist or not			0
while it 's clear that meteorologists who chase know how not to interfere or know how to keep major road stems free of traffic , it 's not clear that others do			0
this is an important issue that the storm research / chaser / spotter community must face in the upcoming years			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity307 .			2

three storm researchers were killed last week studying severe storm near @entity10
@entity307 says meteorologists conduct scientific research on storms in the field
publicity about storm chasers has led many amateurs into the field , he says
@entity307 : storm researchers need to confront issues about rising number of chasers
