-- the numbers tell the story : of the 308 million - plus citizens in the @entity4 , 30 % have passports			1
that 's just too low for such an affluent country , said @entity8 , executive vice president and chief operating officer for the @entity9			2
" @entity4 are comfortable in their own environment , " @entity8 said			1
there were 61.5 million trips outside the @entity4 in 2009 , down 3 % from 2008 , according to the @entity13			1
about 50 % of those trips were to either @entity15 or @entity16 , destinations that did n't require a passport until 2007			1
the percentage of @entity4 with passports -- a number that was in the teens just a few years ago -- has spiked since the @entity23 was adopted			1
it requires @entity4 and @entity16 travelers to present documents showing citizenship when entering the @entity4			1
despite the climbing number of @entity4 passports in circulation , 30 % is still low compared to @entity16 's 60 % and the @entity31 's 75 %			1
" not taking the leap is comforting , because this is the @entity4 life , " said @entity32 , international traveler and creator of @entity34 , a blog chronicling his travels and observations			1
" breaking outside anything that is your norm is scary			2
" tourism experts and avid travelers attribute @entity4 ' lack of interest in international travel to a few key factors , including : the @entity4 ' own rich cultural and geographic diversity , an @entity4 skepticism and / or ignorance about international destinations , a work culture that prevents @entity4 from taking long vacations abroad and the prohibitive cost and logistics of going overseas			1
cultural and geographical diversity @entity4 has it all : " from the mountains , to the prairies , to the oceans , white with foam , " as " @entity62 " proclaims			1
beautiful beaches in @entity68 , crisp skiing in @entity64 and the desert sun in @entity66 are among thousands of domestic destinations competing to lure visitors			0
" in the @entity4 , we have an enormous amount of places we can travel -- basically an entire continent , " said everything - everywhere.com author @entity71 , who has been traveling abroad and blogging since 2007			1
" you can do all kinds of things without needing a passport			0
" @entity71 , who was in @entity81 when interviewed by @entity0 , noted that he could go to any number of different ethnic enclaves within the city and get a taste of culture without spending much money or time			0
the same goes for many other parts of the country			2
" there are pockets of regional culture -- the @entity93 has an attitude that @entity95 's do n't have , " @entity32 said			0
" but you do n't have the cultural differences that you would get if you went to @entity97 , @entity98 or @entity99			0
" even with @entity101 in @entity81 and @entity102 in @entity95 , it 's just not the same as walking the streets of @entity104 or riding a gondola in @entity106			0
" @entity4 is an outstanding country and an outstanding vacation destination -- no doubt about that , " said @entity107 , executive vice president for @entity108			1
" but it is @entity4			1
i 'm sure you have great @entity116 traditional music in an @entity4 @entity116 pub , but you do n't have the @entity118			1
" skepticism and ignorance we buy goods from @entity122 and outsource business to @entity124 , but when it comes to traveling to these destinations , @entity4 would rather stick close to home			1
" our culture does n't emphasize knowledge of the world , " @entity32 said			2
" we 're more skeptical of it because we just do n't know about it			0
" @entity32 attributes some of our skepticism to negative media reports about the world			2
for example , he said that @entity137 always draws negative connotations because of the political and civil unrest that has been covered in the news			0
" when i first left i was very nervous and scared , " @entity32 said of traveling to countries like @entity137			0
" what if i 'm mugged in @entity144 or kidnapped in a hostel ? " @entity71 has encountered similar feelings when he travels to lesser - known destinations			0
though he is comfortable in his travels , others are n't so convinced			0
" every time i say i 'm going somewhere , people assume that it 's dirty , they do n't have good hospitals , you 're going to get sick or raped or robbed , " @entity71 said			0
" if you know something about @entity158 , it 's drug lords , which has n't been a problem for 20 years , but that 's still what people think of			0
" @entity71 pointed out that foreign countries generally do n't make it into the media for doing good things , just for natural disasters or bad news			0
" i think there 's a lot of fears that people have that may be used to justify the fact that they do n't go somewhere , " he said			0
work culture many @entity4 follow the same pattern : work hard in high school , go to college , accrue a load of debt and get a job right away to work it off , @entity71 said			1
the @entity4 does n't promote taking a year off between major life phases like @entity184 or the @entity31			1
" up until recently , having a gap year was a job killer , so you chose work , " @entity32 said			0
" and that work , work , work mentality makes it much harder to leave			0
" a one - year break in your resume could make an @entity4 employer question your commitment to a company , whereas not taking a gap year in @entity184 would be considered crazy , @entity32 said			1
" we 're not a travel culture , " he said			2
" countries are travel cultures when they put more of an emphasis on leisure time , and @entity4 tend to choose money over leisure time			1
" even those who do receive a nice chunk of vacation time do n't use it all , and those who do seem to take shorter , more frequent trips , @entity71 said			2
" there are some differences in terms of vacation time that are hugely influential , " @entity107 said			0
workers in mainland @entity215 receive between six and eight weeks of vacation , while @entity4 average about 16.6 paid vacation days as of 2005 , according to the @entity218 and @entity219			1
thirty - six percent of those surveyed did n't plan to use their full vacation			0
" it 's not just about how much vacation time people get , " @entity71 said			0
" @entity4 do n't even use all the vacation time that they have			1
" cost and logistics when trying to entice @entity4 to visit @entity116 , @entity107 said the first thing he does is remind people that it 's more affordable than they think			1
" that 's generally true of vacations to @entity215 , " @entity107 said			0
" the exchange rate is more favorable for @entity4 than it has been in recent years			1
" the 30.3 million @entity4 who traveled overseas for vacation in 2009 spent an average of $ 2,708 each -- including airfare , lodging and other expenditures , according to the @entity13			1
it seems that getting there is about half the battle : average airfare per person was $ 1,177			0
also , as @entity32 pointed out , time is money for some @entity4			1
" it 's an easier hop if you 're in @entity98 or @entity244 , or any other @entity215 city , " @entity107 said			0
" whereas the flights from the @entity247 of the @entity4 take up to six hours			1
" the @entity4 is so big that a flight from one state to another could take just as much time as a flight to @entity215			2
at any rate , @entity4 are more likely to do the former			2
" we 're a big country , and we have a culture of traveling within the @entity4 , " @entity8 said			1
" when you 're born and raised in a @entity215 or @entity261 country , your access to other countries is much easier			2
" @entity71 does n't see this changing any time soon , if at all			0
" cultural shifts like that are not something that happens quickly , " he said			0
a swing toward international travel is going to take time			2
still , @entity32 said he believes that more @entity4 going abroad will become inevitable sooner or later			2
" @entity4 are going to have to speak more languages and be more culturally savvy , " @entity32 said			1
" we have to change because we have to do business with all these other cultures			0
" that 's music to @entity8 's ears			0
after being nervous the first time he landed in @entity278 , he said he now feels just as comfortable on the streets of @entity104 as he does anywhere in the @entity4			2
" one of the true benefits of travel to foreign countries is it 's probably the greatest form of diplomacy , " @entity8 said			2
" strange ideas go away and you realize that we 're all similar , just with different cultures			0
