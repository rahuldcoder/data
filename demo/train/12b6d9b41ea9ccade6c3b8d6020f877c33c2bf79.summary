-- over the course of two days , 10.5 million people spent four hours watching @entity3 and @entity5 player @entity4 tie the knot			1
since the couple 's @entity9 special , " @entity3 's @entity8 , " which aired on october 9 and 10 , the pair has honeymooned in @entity11 , celebrated @entity3 's 31st birthday in @entity13 , filmed a new season of " @entity15 @entity16 " and filed for divorce			1
citing irreconcilable differences , according to court documents from @entity20 , @entity3 filed for divorce from her husband of 72 days on monday			1
please take this time to pick your jaws up off the floor			0
wait , you 're not surprised ? most people probably saw this coming , said @entity28 , executive editor at @entity29			1
" anyone that saw the wedding and the time leading up to it ... there was an ' @entity35 , what 's she getting herself into ? ' " @entity28 said			0
" i do n't think people are surprised that there was trouble and that it ended			1
but i do n't think people expected it to end this fast			1
" " @entity3 's @entity8 " -- an appropriate title , as " @entity3 's @entity47 " would miss something in syndication -- certainly did n't skimp on the drama			1
if the couple was trying to display how in love they were to the world , they fell a little short			0
@entity0 readers react to the divorce news the special showed the couple arguing over everything from seating charts and desserts to who would perform at their wedding ( singer @entity61 beat out @entity62			2
) not to mention the blowout that ensued when @entity3 told @entity4 she was n't taking his name			1
they probably did n't go through every detail that should be discussed before a wedding , @entity28 said , noting that some media outlets are reporting the couple could n't agree on a place to live			2
" i have to be in @entity72 for work and ( @entity4 ) loves to go to @entity74 and he also has a place in @entity76 , " @entity3 told people in september			1
" i think we 'll kind of figure it out as we go along			0
" " that 's why you have a relationship , then an engagement , then a marriage , " @entity28 added			2
" celebrities often call their engagements off , too			0
the fact that it was being filmed for tv might have accelerated all their problems			0
" face it : if a couple ca n't compromise on what desserts to have at their wedding , how are they supposed to settle on a place to live ? and let 's not forget about the mustache @entity4 grew before the big day to prove he still had control over his life			2
( he ended up shaving it before walking down the aisle			0
) of course , it 's impossible to discount the role editing plays in reality shows like this one			0
however , why would @entity9 be hell - bent on making sure @entity3 and her future hubby looked completely discontented with one another ? so what does it come down to ? " @entity3 wanted to get married and be a wife and a bride , " said @entity110 , a news manager at @entity111			1
" but did that trump , ' i want to marry @entity4 and be his wife ? ' " " after all the wedding hoopla ended , " @entity110 added , " they realized they 're not good for each other			0
" @entity120 want weddings , not marriage but , @entity110 and @entity123 agree , sham is n't the right word to describe the pair 's short - lived union			1
" guess what , she really got married and she really got divorced , " @entity28 said			0
" this part was n't scripted			0
... she did n't want to get divorced in front of the whole world			0
what about the people who gave them wedding gifts ? ... this is n't a game she played			1
she tried to make it work			0
" on the flip side , when @entity145 wed @entity146 after one month , some people assumed their marriage was just a publicity stunt			2
now , two years later , the couple is still together			0
ironically , or not , their relationship was even questioned by @entity4 during " @entity3 's @entity8 " special			2
seventy - two days of marriage might yield a one - hour divorce special , @entity110 said , but , " how much great tv would they have gotten if @entity3 and @entity4 had moved to @entity74 , not liked it , moved back to @entity72 ? ... this could have been something they played out for months			1
" @entity110 , who said @entity3 and @entity4 were " 100 % genuine , " joked , " if this was made up for the show , they could have done it a lot better			2
