-- december 3 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : fridays are awesome on @entity16 ! and on this friday , we 're talking about sports ; we 're talking about politics ; we are doing it all with absolutely no commercials			0
@entity0 starts right now ! first up : @entity24 @entity25 : first up , tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 : should they stay , or should they go ? when they were passed , these cuts lowered everyone 's taxes			1
but the debate has been whether these cuts should be extended for everyone			0
yesterday , the @entity35 voted to extend the tax cuts , but only for families that make less than $ 250,000 a year			0
if you make more than that , your taxes would go up			0
@entity42 argue that the government ca n't afford to continue the tax cuts for wealthy @entity45			1
@entity46 say that not extending those cuts could hurt the economy even more			0
even though the vote happened , the debate still is n't over			1
the @entity51 has to vote on this , and sources have said that both parties -- and the president -- are trying to work out a compromise that could mean an extension of the tax cuts for everyone			0
how @entity61 could it get ? @entity25 : another big issue facing @entity63 is the federal debt			1
that is how much money the @entity45 government borrows to pay its bills			1
earlier this week , a bipartisan commission announced some of its ideas about how to cut the debt			1
we reported on that yesterday			0
but what if nothing happens ? what if the debt just keeps getting bigger ? @entity77 examines some of the possibilities			1
( begin video ) @entity80 , @entity16 national correspondent : as @entity83 countries are roiled by spending cuts to stave off bankruptcy , the focus turns to @entity45 debt			1
with a bipartisan panel commissioned by the president warning , " if the @entity45 does not put its house in order , the reckoning will be sure and the devastation severe			1
" at stake : a national public debt of nine trillion dollars			1
panel member @entity95 , the ceo of @entity96 , spells it out like this : @entity95 , ceo , @entity96 : so , to put it into perspective , if you had spent a million dollars a day since @entity102 was born 2,010 years ago , you would still not have spent a trillion dollars			0
@entity103 : while there 's debate over what and how to cut , to do nothing carries the risk of a collapsed economy requiring an international bailout like what happened recently in countries like @entity113 and @entity114			1
the question is , could the same thing happen to the @entity45 ? even leading fiscal experts say it 's impossible to predict , but ... @entity119 , @entity120 : the whole world is watching right now			1
and the folks on @entity123 and who lend the @entity45 money from around the world are watching what we are doing and seeing if we get our fiscal house in order			1
@entity103 : and @entity130 , the head of the @entity131 , says the @entity45 does n't have a lot of time to act			1
the risk is tied to @entity45 dependence on foreign lenders , especially @entity137			1
if those lenders do n't see the @entity45 as a safe haven , they could pull back			1
but @entity141 , @entity45 editor of the economist , says the rest of the world has no interest in seeing the @entity45 collapse into bankruptcy			1
@entity147 , economist : in the case of the @entity137 , they 're not buying treasury bonds as some charitable act			0
they 're doing it to prop up the @entity45 dollar because that actually makes it easier for them to export stuff to the @entity45 @entity103 : bottom line is , it affects everybody			1
if the @entity45 has to pay more to borrow money , it trickles down to higher interest rates for everything to mortgages to business loans			1
and ultimately , that hurts economic growth			0
@entity77 , @entity16 , @entity170			0
( @entity171 ) @entity172 @entity173 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity176 's social studies classes at @entity177 in @entity178 , @entity179 ! which of these terms is a form of political punishment ? is it : a ) @entity186 , b ) reconciliation , c ) censure or @entity188 ) filibuster ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! a censure is an official reprimand of someone who 's done something wrong			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! rep. @entity197 @entity25 : might not sound that bad , but in political terms , a censure is a big deal			1
yesterday , the @entity35 voted to censure @entity170 democratic representative @entity202			0
@entity202 , whom you see here , has served in the @entity35 for nearly 40 years			0
last month , he was found guilty of violating @entity35 ethics rules , including failing to pay some taxes			0
he apologized , but says he has n't done anything corrupt and asked the @entity35 for fairness before it voted on the censure yesterday			2
as part of his punishment , @entity202 has to stand on the @entity35 floor while the censure against him is read out loud			0
@entity214 hosts @entity25 : all right , kicking it over to sports , now			0
who is going to host the @entity214 , the world 's biggest soccer tournament ? we already know it 's @entity220 in 2014			2
as for the one after that ... @entity222 , @entity223 president : ... organized in @entity4			0
@entity25 : @entity4 will play host to the tournament in 2018			0
it 'll be the first time that the country is home to the @entity214			0
@entity230 : the winner to organize the @entity232 is @entity5			0
@entity25 : and the @entity234 nation of @entity5 will be host in 2022			0
it 'll be that country 's first time hosting , as well			2
soccer officials said one reason they chose @entity5 was because they 're trying to help soccer grow around the world			0
touchdown controversy @entity25 : from futbol to football , american football			2
what a player did during a @entity250 high school playoff game is getting a lot of attention			2
check this out : @entity254 followed up this touchdown run by kneeling for a quick prayer and pointing to the sky			2
but then a flag comes flying in			0
the ref said it was unsportsmanlike conduct for excessive celebration			0
@entity254 's done this same kneel - and - point after every touchdown this season			2
never gotten a flag before			0
but the rule is that players have to give up the ball immediately after a touchdown , and they ca n't draw attention to themselves			2
@entity254 says he was n't ; he was drawing attention to @entity102			2
but he also says that the refs are in charge , and he is n't planning to point to the sky after future touchdowns , at least on the field			2
@entity277 @entity25 : what a story , what a controversy , what an opportunity for you to sound off on our blog			0
do you agree with the penalty ? and if this had happened to you , would you have stopped praying after scoring touchdowns ? our blog at @entity290 is anxiously awaiting your comments ! i am anxiously awaiting the chance to report on them ! @entity295 @entity296 , @entity14 : see if you can i.d. me ! i was built between 1792 and 1800			2
i have two wings and 132 different rooms			0
i 'm located at @entity300			1
i 'm the @entity300 , and i 've been home to more than 40 families ! @entity303 @entity25 : well , they say there 's no place like home for the holidays , even when you live in one of the most famous houses on the planet			1
the @entity300 is decked out in @entity314 decorations , and an estimated 20,000 people will be invited to events there during this holiday season			1
first lady @entity318 opened up the doors at @entity300 to give everyone a look			1
@entity318 , first lady of the @entity45 : in many ways , this is really what the @entity300 is all about			1
and i say this all the time , it is the people 's house			2
it 's a place that is steeped in history , but it is also a place where everyone should feel welcome			2
here at the @entity300 , we have 19 @entity314 trees in every corner of the @entity300			1
we have a giant bow made out of pipe cleaners			0
we have 350 pounds of gingerbread house that you 'll get to see , that took our wonderful pastry chef @entity343 and his team an entire month to create			0
over the last few days , nearly 100 volunteers from all over the country have been working so hard			0
they 've been making all of the ornaments , they 've been hanging the lights and transforming these rooms into breathtaking works of art. that spirit of kindness and generosity is really what the holiday season is all about			2
and it was the idea behind this year 's theme , which is @entity358 , because in the end , the greatest blessings of all are the ones that do n't cost a thing			1
the time that we spend with our loved ones , the freedoms we enjoy as @entity45 , and the joy we feel from reaching out to those in need			1
@entity371 @entity25 : knock , knock			0
who 's there ? your principal , and he 's here to check on your homework ! doctor @entity378 , a high school principal , is dropping in on one family to try to whip them into shape			2
it 's a special program called @entity371 , and it airs tomorrow at 2:30 and 4:30 @entity234 on @entity16			2
check it out ! before we go @entity25 : finally today , you know that expression " bend but do n't break " ? this little lady is finding out exactly what that means			1
the doorstop she 's fighting ai n't going nowhere ! yeah , it 's an adorable animal @entity393 video			1
and you have to give the puppy points for persistence			0
@entity397 is displaying some dogged determination here , even if her opponent in this epic battle seems lifeless			0
we 'd suggest that the bulldog take on a doorstop her own size			0
goodbye @entity25 : but it 's possible that she 'd just recoil in fear			2
we 've reached the tail end of our show , but we 'll spring back with more @entity0 next week			1
hope you have a great weekend			0
