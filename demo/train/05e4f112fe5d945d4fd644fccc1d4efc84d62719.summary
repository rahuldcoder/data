@entity0 -- what may be the most contentious @entity4 contract is the focus of yet another fight , with this round centered on whether a bid for a $ 35 billion contract should be thrown out because it arrived five minutes late			1
for about a decade the @entity11 has been trying to replace its fleet of @entity14 air refueling tankers , the big jets that act as flying gas stations for warplanes			1
in the latest attempt , three companies wanted to submit bids to build the @entity21 , the next generation of tankers ; @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
each company 's bid was required to be submitted to an office at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , by 2 p.m. july 9			1
@entity24 and @entity25 got their bids into the office with time to spare			1
@entity26 said its bid arrived at @entity30 half an hour before the deadline			2
the @entity4 said it was five minutes late			0
@entity26 is a new company that is in partnership with @entity38 , a state - owned @entity40 aircraft manufacturer that used to build planes for the @entity43 's military and now specializes in building very large aircraft			1
because of the late arrival of the bid , the @entity4 will not consider @entity26 's proposal , according to @entity4 chief spokesman @entity48			1
" we are not allowed by law to even review their proposal			0
it did not arrive in time			2
so we can not consider it			0
we can not review it , " @entity48 said			0
a spokesman for @entity26 , @entity57 , said the @entity58 " still feel [ s ] the cold war is on " and does n't want @entity61 aerospace to succeed in the bid			2
@entity48 said the rules are clear			0
" this is a $ 30 billion to $ 40 billion contract			1
that is not a high school homework assignment , ok ? these deadlines count , and any professional contractor understands that , " he said			0
@entity57 , a spokesman for @entity26 , said the bid proposal was on time			1
" we have documented evidence that the messenger [ who was carrying the bid ] was there at 1:30			1
" but @entity30 is a huge facility and the company said the messenger was held up at the gate , then got lost driving to the building where the bid needed to be			1
when the messenger and the bid proposal finally arrived at the proper location , the bid was marked as having arrived at 2:05			2
the company was told the bid would not be considered			2
@entity26 is fighting that decision and asking that its bid proposal , which it said will save @entity61 taxpayers millions of dollars and produce a better tanker plane , be considered			0
that might mean further delay in a process that began in 2002 and has been stopped and restarted twice			0
@entity48 said he is confident that the dispute with @entity26 will not slow the process again			0
" are we concerned about their protest that it might lead to a delay in the awarding of this contract ? i do n't believe so , " @entity48 said			0
" this is going on			0
we will -- we will award this contract in the fall , as we always said we would			0
