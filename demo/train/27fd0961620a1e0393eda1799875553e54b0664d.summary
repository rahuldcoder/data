-- the @entity1 has lifted its assessment of @entity4 's economy , and underlined progress towards its price target by saying that inflation expectations " appear to be rising			1
" in an upbeat statement following a two - day policy meeting , the @entity1 said the world 's third - largest economy is " recovering moderately " , boosted by a pick - up in exports and investment in fixed assets by companies on the back of higher profits			1
public investment is also rising , it noted , while the housing sector is looking stronger			0
as such , the @entity1 kept its main policy settings on hold , as it has done every month since april , when governor @entity23 unveiled what he called a " new phase " of " quantitative and qualitative monetary easing			1
" the aim is to hit a 2 per cent target for inflation by buying up huge amounts of assets , mostly longer - term bonds			0
this week the @entity1 reported that @entity4 's monetary base expanded 42 per cent from a year earlier in august , to @entity34 ( $ 1.72tn ) , marking an all - time high for the sixth straight month			1
meanwhile , the balance of current accounts deposited at the @entity1 more than doubled to @entity37 , as banks parked proceeds of bond sales			0
analysts say that the @entity1 is now at a delicate juncture in its easing programme , where it is hoping that so - called " bad inflation " caused by the drop in the yen since late last year is gradually replaced by " good inflation " , signalling a virtuous cycle of demand			2
for now , the evidence is mixed			0
the @entity4 - style core measure of consumer price inflation , which excludes food but not energy , climbed to 0.7 per cent in july , its highest level in nearly five years			2
the @entity57 - style core measure , which strips out both food and energy , is also on a rising trend but is still negative , at minus 0.1 per cent in july			0
prices for items such as housing , furniture and medical care all fell from a year earlier			1
meanwhile , lending activity is still relatively subdued , with total loans rising 2.2 per cent in july			0
base salaries are generally flat , or falling			0
however , prices are moving in line with the policy board 's forecasts , which means that the @entity1 is under little pressure to do more to try to force the index higher			2
the onus now shifts to the government , say analysts , as it prepares to address some of the structural reforms set out in the growth strategy of @entity80 , prime minister			1
@entity80 wants to make @entity4 a more competitive place to invest and to do business , thus stimulating employment , incomes and consumption			1
" [ @entity1 ] policy board members are continuing to shun ' incremental easing ' " , said @entity86 , economist at @entity87 in @entity88			2
she expects the @entity1 to leave monetary conditions unchanged for the remainder of the fiscal year to april			1
" with the central bank out of the hot seat for now , the focus is squarely on the government			0
