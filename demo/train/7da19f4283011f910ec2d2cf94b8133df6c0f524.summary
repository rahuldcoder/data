-- the recent opening of the world 's first peak - to - peak suspension bridge in @entity4 is yet another example of how footbridges -- once simply built to provide passage over challenging obstacles -- are increasingly being designed with thrill seekers in mind			1
here 's a closer look at this new @entity4 beauty and other amazing footbridges around the world			2
@entity15 by @entity16 ( @entity17 , @entity4 ) in october , the world 's first pedestrian suspension bridge to connect two mountain peaks opened on @entity21 in @entity4 's @entity17			1
the 107 - meter ( 351 feet ) bridge connects @entity24 peak with @entity26 peak			2
famed alpine peaks @entity28 , the @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 can be all be seen from the bridge 's observation deck			2
the bridge , which cost $ 2 million dollars to build , will stay open all year around			0
peak walk by @entity16 , @entity21 3000 , @entity37 253 , @entity38 , @entity4 @entity39 ( @entity40 , @entity41 ) the world 's longest pedestrian bridge forms part of @entity40 's new @entity46 attraction , which includes the world 's highest swing and a 700 - meter - long zip wire			1
the 439 - meter - long bridge has two observation platforms , both offering spectacular views of the @entity54			1
there 's also a bungee jumping platform from the center of the structure			0
@entity41 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity40 , @entity61 @entity62 ( @entity28 massif , @entity64 ) this bridge links the north and south peaks of the @entity62 in the @entity68 , and is located 3,842 meters ( 12,604 feet ) above sea level			1
getting here involves a ride on the world 's highest vertical ascent cable car			2
from the top , visitors can see into @entity64 , @entity4 and @entity76			1
@entity62 , @entity28 massif , @entity64 @entity78 ( @entity79 , @entity80 ) this structure looks flimsier than it is -- it 's actually made of metal , but a bamboo top layer was added to give it an authentic -- or , depending on your perspective , scary -- look			1
it hangs 25 meters ( 82 feet ) above the river			0
visitors wanting to do their best @entity91 impression can even buy a facsimile hat at a stall on the riverbank			0
@entity95 , @entity96 , @entity79 , @entity80 @entity97 ( @entity98 , @entity99 ) at 530 meters long ( 1,650 feet ) , this is @entity99 's longest suspension bridge			1
we have a suspicion it 's the narrowest , too			0
it stretches across the top of the trees of @entity97 , @entity99 's largest national park			0
visitors with a fear of heights will be reassured to know that the ropes are checked every morning			0
@entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 @entity110 ( @entity111 , @entity112 ) the @entity110 suspension bridge stretches 137 meters ( 450 feet ) across and 70 meters ( 230 feet ) above @entity111 's @entity114			2

today , it 's @entity111 's oldest and most popular attraction , receiving more than 700,000 visitors per year			0
@entity120 , 3735 @entity121 , @entity111 , @entity122 , @entity112 @entity78 of @entity123 ( @entity124 ) it 's not just humans who use this bridge -- donkeys , cows and goats use it , as well			1
in fact , it was built specifically for animals , as a solution to the congestion caused by cattle being herded up and down @entity123 's narrow roads			1
today , animals remain the biggest users of the @entity78 of @entity123 , prodded along by the farmers who also use it to deliver produce to local families			1
@entity123 , @entity143 , @entity124 @entity144 ( @entity145 , @entity4 ) this @entity4 suspension bridge , which can only be accessed via a cable car , hangs above the @entity148 and has a length of 170 meters ( 557 feet )			1
it was built as a response to global warming -- until recently , the mountaineering hut at the top of the glacier could be reached on foot , but when the glacier started to shrink , the bridge became the only route of access			0
the structure is based on traditional @entity124 rope bridges and is the longest and highest in the @entity68			1

it was named after @entity191 , wife of @entity192 and mother of @entity194 , who built the castle			0
there was already a wooden bridge spanning the gorge , but @entity194 wanted something more substantial from which to watch his castle 's construction , so he replaced the wooden railings with iron ones			2
@entity188 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 more 15 amazing spots to find natural bridges @entity207 ( @entity206 , @entity208 ) this bridge was originally constructed so that fishermen could cross the 30 - meter - deep and 20 - meter - wide gorge to check their salmon nets , but it 's since become one of @entity208 's most popular tourist attractions			1
the nearby @entity215 has a collection of photographs depicting people performing various stunts on the bridge , including one local doing a handstand on a chair in the middle of the structure			0
