-- screenwriter @entity1 has written some of the most famous lines in movie history			1
" my name is @entity9			2
prepare to die " from " @entity11			2
" " is it safe ? " from " @entity13			2
" " follow the money " from " all the president 's men			2
" " think ya used enough dynamite there , @entity20 ? " from " @entity21			2
" he 's won two @entity22 , two @entity23 , a @entity24 and a career achievement award from the @entity26			2
he obviously knows how to write			0
and he still has no idea why some of his dialogue manages to become part of the national vernacular			0
there are so many factors that go into creating a movie , he says , that it 's all a writer can do to get his script right			1
" when you 're doing a movie you have no idea who the powers on the movie are going to be , and is there going to be a star who wants this line or does n't like that line			1
you 're at the mercy of everybody and you do the best you can , " he says			0
" but you never know			0
" ( it 's no wonder that another of @entity52 's most famous lines is his summation of @entity54 : " nobody knows anything			0
" ) if you 're a screenwriter , it 's not exactly something you can plan			1
maybe the actor gives a line a poor spin ; maybe the director does n't capture the moment ; maybe the film editor changes the rhythm of the scene in the cutting room			1
it 's been said that nobody plans to make a bad film , but with so many variables at play , even a good script is n't bulletproof			1
great cast ! great director ! why did that movie flop ? @entity77 , editor of " the @entity78 " and several other books in the field , points out that movie quotations can be a shorthand -- something that brings up powerful associations			1
" some movie quotes become popular because they evoke a great film , or a great scene , or a great actor , " he says			1
" sometimes the words of the quote become proverbial -- something like ' the natives are restless ' or ' if you build it they will come ' or ' win one for the @entity96 ! ' they enter into the language			1
" he also notes that lines tend to get condensed or changed			0
for example , he was quick to point out that the correct quotation from " @entity101 " is " if you build it , he will come			0
" they 're also social glue			0
repeat a line from popular comedies such as " airplane ! " or " @entity110 and the @entity111 , " and you can immediately establish bonds with similarly minded individuals			0
this summer @entity116 fans have been fond of repeating , " i am @entity118			0
" the late @entity119 was a champ at composing such wisecracks , anti-establishment jokes that have been repeated by generations of viewers			1
during the @entity22 , @entity124 even promoted its " mini can " with a commercial that featured only well - known movie quotations			1
why that strategy ? " we want to take this to an emotional place , " @entity128 , @entity130 's vp - marketing for colas , told @entity133			0
@entity77 makes a distinction between popular quotations and catchphrases			2
the latter is more of a trademark , he says -- @entity144 's " what 's up , doc ? " , for example -- and incessantly repeated			1
they 're often even said in the voice of the performer			0
it 's hard to say " make my day " without evoking @entity151 's clenched - jaw delivery			2
these days , thanks to repeated television showings , video streaming and the @entity156 , quotations attach themselves to our craniums more quickly than ever			1
ironically , that means the person who wrote the immortal line is now more ignored than ever			0
think about @entity52 's classics : who do you think of , the actor or the writer ? " nobody cares about who the screenwriter is , " @entity1 says			1
" that 's one of the things you have to deal with if you write a screenplay			0
nobody has the least knowledge of what 's going to work , and everybody wants @entity178			0

no one can plan or guess about which movie quotations will become much repeated
screenwriter @entity1 says the writer is mostly likely thinking about the story
quotes are a shorthand , evoking a whole movie -- and the *memories* of that film
