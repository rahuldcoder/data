-- was @entity1 really born in @entity2 ? a new @entity0 investigation reveals what most analysts have been saying since the " birther " controversy erupted during the 2008 presidential campaign : @entity1 was born in @entity8 on august 4 , 1961			1
while the president has made light of the controversy , the question remains political red meat for some of his critics			2
a recent @entity17 poll showed that nearly 75 % of @entity2 believe @entity1 was definitely or probably born in the @entity2			2
more than four in 10 republicans , however , believe he probably or definitely was not born in @entity2			0
evidence again shows @entity1 born in @entity8 the @entity2 @entity21 says only " natural born " citizens can become president -- a vague clause that some members of the birther movement contend disqualifies @entity1 because , they insist , he was born outside the @entity2			1
skeptics contend , among other things , that @entity1 was born in his father 's home country of @entity31			1
potential @entity33 presidential candidate @entity32 recently seized on the issue , saying he had doubts about @entity1 's background			1
@entity37 : the fantasy of @entity32 @entity0 investigators in @entity40 found nothing to reinforce those doubts			2
dr. @entity43 , a former director of the @entity44 and a @entity33 , told @entity0 in her most extensive comments to date that she has " no doubt " @entity1 was born in the state			1
@entity1 's 2008 campaign produced a certification of live birth , a document legally accepted as confirmation of a birth and routinely used for official purposes			1
@entity43 went one step further , taking advantage of a state law that allows certain public officials to examine a person 's actual birth certificate if there is a " direct and tangible interest			2
" the president 's certificate , she said , is stored in a vault in the building that houses the @entity44			1
ironically , unlike the certificate of live birth , it is no longer accepted for official usage			1
@entity1 's certificate is " absolutely authentic , " she said			2
" he was absolutely born here in the state of @entity8			2
" @entity75 governor criticizes birther " distraction " to see what happens when someone born in @entity8 requests a birth certificate , @entity0 asked a current resident of the state -- @entity82 -- if he could get a copy of the document			1
@entity86 was born hours after @entity1 in august 1961			1
like @entity1 , @entity86 's birth was announced at the time in the @entity89 newspaper			1
@entity86 , like @entity1 in 2008 , was given a certification of live birth in response to his request			1
could @entity1 's 1961 birth announcement in the @entity89 be a fake ? some conspiracy theorists say yes			1
@entity98 newspaper reporter @entity97 says no. " it 's not possible , " @entity97 said			0
" under the system that existed back then , there was no avenue for people to submit information that way			0
... the information came directly from the @entity107			0
" indeed , as @entity0 confirmed , all birth announcements at the time came directly from hospital birth records			0
@entity32 questions birth certificate could @entity1 , a self - proclaimed @entity112 , be preventing the distribution of copies of the original birth certificate because it identifies him as a @entity116 ? @entity43 says no. the original certificate includes no mention of the president 's religion			1
and indeed , other original certificates from that time do n't mention faith			0
@entity1 could file a @entity125 request to view his original birth certificate and make copies			2
but at this point , the @entity128 maintains , nothing will satisfy the doubters			0
@entity132 , a 2008 @entity133 voter who now lives in @entity1 's childhood home in @entity8 , counts himself among the doubters			1
he said he wants to find someone who saw @entity1 immediately after the president was born			1
@entity8 gov. @entity138 said he did			2
@entity138 , a @entity139 , was friendly with @entity140 , @entity1 's mother , and remembers celebrating the birth			1
" of course , we had no idea at the time that the future president of the @entity2 was that little boy , that little baby , " @entity138 recalled			0
but " we are very , very happy ... that took place			0
" professor @entity147 of the @entity148 was a faculty adviser to @entity140 and also knew the future president when he was a child			0
she called the controversy " funny			0
" she said there is " no way " @entity1 was n't born in the state			2
@entity154 remembered a conversation in which @entity140 compared the birth of @entity1 with that of his sister , @entity158 , who was born overseas			1
" she said , ' when i had @entity158 , it was a lot of more difficult because @entity160 does n't believe in painkillers while you 're giving birth			0
... of course , in the @entity2 , giving birth to @entity1 ( @entity1 's childhood nickname ) was quite different and much more comfortable , ' " @entity154 recalled			1
@entity86 's mother , @entity166 , said she believes she saw @entity1 in @entity40 's @entity167 next to her son in 1961			1
" in those days , there were hardly any other black babies , " she said			0
the hospital would n't show patient records from 1961 , but the state 's @entity174 population was less than 1 % at the time			0
regardless of the evidence , there may be no convincing some of those who question the president 's origins			1
" i find it a bit amusing in the sense that ( the issue ) keeps resurfacing over and over again , " @entity43 said			0
" it really tells us that the whole conspiracy notion is out there ( and ) that if there is an issue that needs a following , they will find one			0
" no matter what you do or say , it make no difference , " she said			0
@entity138 , who tried to put an end to the controversy when he became governor , said he hopes that " people who have this political orientation toward the president respect us here in @entity8			2
" " respect his mother and father , " the governor urged			0
" respect the people i loved and the people that i knew , and the little boy who grew up here in paradise and became president			0
" that , the evidence suggests , may be easier said than done			0
