when sen. @entity1 , @entity2 got out of his car at the @entity4 on wednesday , he did not to go into the @entity5 where he works			1
he was on the @entity7 side to join a conservative rally to press their own @entity10 leaders to use the power of the purse to fight the president on immigration			1
since the day @entity1 was sworn in almost two years ago , he has proudly been a thorn in @entity7 @entity10 leaders ' side -- urging them to put principle before practical politics			1
last year the government shut down thanks to a strategy pushed by @entity1 to tie defunding @entity23 to funding the government			1
but even then he did n't take the extra step , literally , to physically go to the @entity7 and , symbolically , put his thumb in the eye of house speaker @entity28			2
on his way to the podium , this reporter asked why he is inserting himself in what the @entity7 is doing			2
" i do n't agree with the premise of what you 're saying , " @entity1 responded			2
" republicans campaigned saying if you elect us , if you elect a @entity10 @entity5 , we will stop president @entity39 's illegal acts			0
these elections were a referendum			0
the @entity43 people overwhelmingly said they do not support a lawless amnesty created by the president			0
what i 'm urging @entity10 to do is -- do what we said we would do -- honor the commitments of the @entity43 voters , " @entity1 continued			2
@entity10 aims to avoid shutdown @entity1 wants @entity50 to attach a policy rider to the bill funding the government that denies the president his executive action allowing some 5 million undocumented workers legal status			1
but since the government runs out of money on dec. 11 , leaders in both chambers do n't want to have that fight right now			0
instead they want to pass a bill funding most of the government for a year , and only fund the @entity65 , which oversees immigration laws , for a few months			0
they 're hoping that will buy them time to find an option to fight the president , even while conceding there are no good options			0
frustrated @entity7 @entity10 leadership aides argue that @entity1 pushing to have a fight now is disingenuous because it is unwinnable			1
the @entity5 is still run by @entity77 and they will not pass a bill effectively canceling out the president 's executive authority , never mind that the president would never sign such a bill even if he got it			1
' @entity82 ' looms over @entity39 - @entity84 meeting when asked about this @entity10 criticism , and concern that his strategy could once again lead to a government shutdown , @entity1 balked			1
" no it 's not			0
and it only will if @entity91 decides he wants a shutdown , which it seems @entity91 and president @entity39 are very eager about that prospect			0

@entity1 rallied @entity7 conservatives against a proposed plan to avoid a government shutdown
@entity1 was seen as *largely* *responsible* for the government shutting down last year
@entity1 has repeatedly *rejected* that claim , and said it 's @entity77 who risk causing a shutdown
