@entity1 , @entity0 -- for more than a week , opponents of @entity0 's president @entity4 had the upper hand in @entity1 , protesting with near impunity in the face of police and an army that did little to stop them			1
that all changed on wednesday			0
the morning after @entity4 dramatically announced he would not run for re-election in september , his supporters waded into @entity15 by the thousands , and suddenly serious , prolonged violence reigned in central @entity1			1
there were immediate suspicions that the @entity21 demonstrators were not simply average citizens standing up for the man who has led @entity0 for three decades -- suspicions that proved at least partly founded			2
as battles raged between the two sides , some @entity21 protesters were captured by his opponents			2
some were terrified to be caught and begged for their lives , screaming that the government had paid them to come out and protest			1
others turned out to be carrying what seemed to be police identification , though they were dressed in plain clothes			2
@entity38 , a @entity39 analyst based in @entity40 , told @entity2 that the use of hired muscle to break up demonstrations " is a longtime regime strategy			1
" " there are usually a line of thugs outside a protest who are waiting there , " he said			2
" they 're dressed in plain clothes , and then they 'll usually go and attack the protesters			0
@entity0 have seen this for quite some time , and that 's why they were able to recognize what was going on fairly quickly			0
" the global rights group @entity58 said it has documented the use of unsavory forces by @entity0 authorities to disperse political gatherings in election years			0
" it looks like much of this violence is being orchestrated by the @entity0 authorities in order to force an end to the anti-government protests , restore their control and cling onto power in the face of unprecedented public demands for them to go , " said @entity64 , the deputy director for the @entity65 and @entity66 at @entity58			0
an @entity78 spokesman denied on state - run television that police identification cards had been confiscated from demonstrators			1
he said if they had been , they were were stolen or fake			1
but state television reporting wednesday did not always match @entity2 's own observations of what was happening in @entity15			1
several @entity2 journalists heard from @entity21 demonstrators that they worked for the government			1
staff from the national petrochemical company said they had been ordered to come and protest			1
@entity58 researchers said witnesses told them of " lorry loads " of @entity21 supporters leaving wednesday morning from @entity97 , north of @entity1			2
" these ( @entity21 ) protests were organized by the government and the ruling @entity101 , " analyst @entity98 told @entity2			1
the government mustered government workers and lawmakers whose seats are threatened , he said			1
" they were ordered to go out today			2
they are well organized and that is suspicious -- especially the use of camels and horses			0
these are abnormal techniques to demonstrate , " he said , referring to the shocking charge of about 50 or 60 mounted men through @entity15 in the middle of the afternoon			0
and @entity115 , a @entity65 analyst at the @entity116 , said " reliable contacts in @entity0 " told him the counter-protesters were organized " by @entity4 himself , " with the aid of businessmen who support him			1
" the whole objective is actually to give the impression that there is still support for @entity4 and to force the demonstrators out of @entity15 , " @entity115 said			1
he said the embattled president " is presenting a very difficult choice before the @entity0 people -- either liberty or security -- and he is hoping that they will choose security at the expense of liberty			0
" in @entity139 , @entity138 spokesman @entity137 expressed concerns about the outbreak of violence			0
" the president and this administration strongly condemn the outrageous and deplorable violence that 's taking place on the streets of @entity1 , " @entity137 said			0
" obviously , if any of the violence is instigated by the government , it should stop immediately , " @entity137 added			2
state television called the pro-mubarak demonstrators tourism workers			1
at least some @entity0 working in the tourism industry are known to be genuinely upset at the @entity155 demonstrators , accusing them of hurting their business by bringing instability			2
@entity98 also said it was suspicious that security forces did not intervene to break up the violence			0
" there were no police or military to separate the two crowds at the beginning and that 's also suspicious enough to implicate the security agencies , " @entity98 said			2
journalist and protestor @entity168 told @entity2 she saw men with police uniforms go into hotels on the way to @entity15 and then come out wearing civilian clothes , joining the @entity21 protesters			1
she called that an act of " betrayal			0
" @entity178 interviewed several people at the demonstration who said they backed the president because he had provided stability and independence			0
" for 30 years , we lived in peace			0
president @entity4 kept us safe and secure for 30 years instead of being a country that takes orders from external forces just like ( @entity193 president @entity192 ) @entity191 now wants , " @entity186 , a @entity21 demonstrator , said on @entity187			1
" they want us to be another @entity195 and this will not happen			0
" another man said , " i did n't cry when my father died			0
i cried when @entity4 spoke yesterday			1
i grew up watching him , seeing him , having him as my leader and the great president of this nation			0
" and a female demonstrator said : " @entity4 is our father			1
no one can insult and ridicule their elders			0
if we do that , we belittle ourselves			0
this is how we destroy our country			0
" @entity2 's @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and journalist @entity212 in @entity1 contributed to this report .			1

some state workers told @entity2 they had been ordered to protest
*anti-mubarak* demonstrators say some opponents are police
the government says the police ids are fake or stolen
some demonstrators say @entity4 is like a father to them
