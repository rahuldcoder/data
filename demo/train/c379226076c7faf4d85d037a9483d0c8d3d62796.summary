-- the trial of @entity3 prime minister @entity2 on charges of sex with an underage nightclub dancer and abuse of power opened wednesday in @entity8			1
it lasted 10 minutes and was adjourned until may 31			0
the case is the latest in a long - running series of legal wrangles featuring the scandal - plagued politician and promises to be one of the most controversial trials ever to take place in @entity3			1
what is @entity2 accused of ? prosecutors allege that @entity2 paid for sex with @entity21 , a nightclub dancer nicknamed @entity22 who at the time was 17 - years - old			1
prosecutors also say , in legal papers seen by @entity0 , that @entity2 had sex 13 times with @entity28			1
who is ' @entity22 the heart - stealer ? ' they claim he abused his position when he intervened in may 2010 to get her released from the jail where she was being held on charges of theft			1
@entity2 says the allegations are politically motivated and are an attempt to smear him			1
in @entity3 , the age of consent is 14 , and it is not illegal to pay for sex			1
however , paying for sex with a minor ( under 18 ) is a crime , and can be punished by up to three years in jail			0
@entity2 has said the dancer had been introduced as a 24 - year - old			1
did he give her any money ? @entity28 said she did not know @entity2 well but that she did receive 7,000 euros ( about $ 9,300 ) from him the first time they met , on @entity53 2010 , because a friend told @entity2 she needed help			1
has he been in court before ? yes			0
many times but on march 28 he made his first personal appearance in court in for eight years			0
it was a two - hour closed - door hearing in @entity8 on corruption charges			1
he and others - including his son - are accused of tax fraud and misappropriation of funds			0
what other legal issues is @entity2 facing ? the 74 - year - old @entity3 pm , currently serving his third term in office , also faces charges of bribing @entity72 lawyer @entity71 to secure favorable testimony in legal cases			1
his trial , suspended last spring after he was granted temporary immunity , resumed this month			0
@entity77 denied receiving bribes and his conviction in the case was overturned last year			0
he has survived a series of political , corruption and sex scandals over the years , involving allegations of embezzlement , tax fraud and bribery			2
@entity2 has been tried on at least 17 charges since he was first elected prime minister in 1994 , but none of the cases have resulted in lasting convictions ; several were overturned on appeal			1
he has always denied any wrongdoing , and had previously claimed immunity from prosecution , though a 2008 law granting him this was overturned the following year			0
how has he reacted to the claims ? @entity2 insists he has never paid for sex -- " not even once in my life " -- and says any suggestion he did so is " degrading for my dignity			1

but the young woman 's former roommate told investigators that @entity28 confided to her that she did have a sexual relationship with the premier			0
@entity2 says he did call the police on @entity28 's behalf , but denies this was an abuse of power			2
he says he thought @entity28 was related to the since - deposed @entity115 president @entity114 and he was acting in @entity3 's interest by trying to avoid a diplomatic incident			1
the billionaire media magnate and football club owner says the allegations against him are simply political mudslinging			0
his lawyers have called the investigation " absurd and groundless " and a " grave interference " in @entity2 's private life			2
will this case damage him financially ? a media entrepreneur , @entity2 and his family were number 74 on the @entity131 list of @entity132 for 2010 and worth an estimated $ 9 billion , so the trials are unlikely to make a significant dent to his wealth			2
so , will @entity2 attend any or all of the trials ? yes , according to his attorney @entity138 , who said : " absolutely yes , we have decided to blank his agenda for one day per week , every monday , in order to allow him to participate to all the hearings			2
" @entity2 's lawyers have previously argued that courts in @entity8 do not have jurisdiction in the case -- because of where the alleged crimes were committed -- or the authority to try a prime minister			2
what about @entity2 's political reputation ? long - running scandals , a playboy lifestyle and a series of well - publicized gaffes have opened the @entity3 pm up to widespread ridicule			1
@entity2 has survived two votes of no confidence in recent months , and while his personal approval ratings have been dented , his party , the @entity158 , still enjoys widespread support in @entity3			1
has the @entity163 commented ? the @entity163 has made no comment on ' @entity165 ' , which is in keeping with normal diplomatic relations between the @entity167 and the @entity3 state , says @entity0 's @entity169			2

many @entity3 on the street were clear about their opinion			0
" it does n't really matter if he is found guilty or not			0
i find it deeply upsetting when i watch the tv news , when i read the paper and when i hear about @entity2 and @entity22 , i feel sick , " said @entity179 resident @entity195			0
" i think that the example that is coming from the higher powers must be different , " said @entity199			0
