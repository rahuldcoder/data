-- one year ago , the @entity1 completed a four - month period of " self - reflection " and " evaluation " after losing its second straight presidential election and the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections			1
the result of that process became popularly known as the @entity10 " -- an analysis of all of the @entity13 's ailments and prescriptions for how to cure them			1
but , after a year , it does n't look like they have really learned a thing			1
and their navel - gazing , introspection moment was n't all that new or particularly self - aware , as more than a decade of @entity1 chairmen -- yes , they have all been men -- before @entity22 have all tried the same thing			1
why the @entity1 built a year - round ground game in 2003 , @entity26 proclaimed that " expanding our base by recruiting new @entity13 activists from traditionally strong and @entity31 constituencies is our no. 1 priority			1
in 2005 , @entity35 's " @entity34 " targeted african - americans			2
that did n't go so well			0
and in 2009 , @entity40 's failed " @entity39 " spent a lot of money but did little else			0
year after year , @entity13 leaders have admitted that their party is alienating huge swaths of voters			0
in last year 's report , for nearly 100 pages , they tried to convey the message : " we get it			2
" but here we are , another year later , and all the @entity13 has gotten is a year older , with little else to show for it			0
what the @entity10 has offered over the past 12 months to solve its problems is simply a change in tactics			1
the party hired " outreach staff " and placed them in communities they 've never been in before			0
but one must question whether it is effective outreach when your agenda keeps alienating the very people you are trying to include			0
the party is conducting " candidate trainings " to teach them how to talk to ( and about ) women , hoping to stave off any more " legitimate rape " moments , among other things			0
it 's worked to shorten the primary calendar and limit debates -- though ensuring that fewer people hear your agenda does n't seem a good tactic to achieve your goals on expansion			1
the attempted change in tactics has n't helped the party 's leaders , officials , or endorsed candidates with their chronic foot - in - mouth syndrome			1
in this past year , we 've heard @entity13 leaders and operatives call a female candidate an " empty dress , " talk about women 's libidos , and -- once again -- try to downplay abuse			1
we 've heard them use derogatory terms to describe @entity94 immigrants , comparing them to drug mules			0
they have used insulting stereotypes for african - americans , including just last week when former vice presidential candidate @entity99 used thinly veiled language to talk about the " culture " of laziness among " inner - city men			0
" and gay @entity98 have faced outright discrimination from @entity13 at all levels -- from state party chairmen to candidates to elected officials			2
the @entity13 's failure to rebrand has n't been limited to the disrespectful and insulting language			2
it continues to push an agenda that divides @entity98 , limits equally and denies to many the " pursuit of happiness " -- i.e. , access to economic opportunity			1
in other words , the @entity10 's philosophy has n't changed			1
the leaders may have set out to become a party that is more " inclusive and welcoming , " but in reality the @entity10 has moved in the opposite direction			2
it continues to alienate large communities of @entity98 , embracing a rhetoric that emphasizes fear of others and , ironically , entitlement for themselves			2
the biggest problem for the @entity13 has never been its primary calendar , its campaign tactics or a lack of trainings			0
the party 's biggest problem is what it believes , what it says and how it governs			0
the good news is @entity31 have spent the year building on a foundation of outreach rooted in our core values and an agenda based on equal opportunity			2
@entity31 have pushed for equal pay for women because we know that when women succeed , @entity98 succeeds			1
we push for full equality for all @entity98 , regardless of where they live , what they look like or who they love			1
we push for commonsense immigration reform that is the right thing to do for our economy and our country			0
and we push an economic agenda that simply levels the playing field so that every @entity98 has a chance to move up the economic ladder			1
democrats will use innovative programs and tools to empower grassroots supporters and ensure that @entity31 up and down the ballot have the resources they need to win -- so that we can work to expand opportunity for all @entity98			0

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			0

a year after the @entity10 's " self - reflection , " @entity172 says it does n't appear they get it
all the @entity10 has offered is simply a change in tactics , she says
@entity172 thinks they still do n't get women , minorities and push an agenda that divides @entity98
in other words , she argues , the @entity10 's philosophy has n't changed
