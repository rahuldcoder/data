-- @entity1 is haring down a narrow muddy path on a hillside riding every hump and bump with the skill you would expect from a double world champion			1
she may be surrounded by beautiful , rolling countryside on all sides in north wales , but the trail she is tackling today in @entity12 is known as a bit of a beast in mountain biking circles			1
the course is frighteningly steep in places , frequently rocky and steeped in mud , but the 27 - year - old negotiates every perilous twist and turn with ease			1
" when you are racing and you get it right , it feels amazing , " @entity1 told @entity0 's human to @entity23			1
" it almost feels like a meditation or a dance because you feel at one with your bike , putting it exactly where it needs to be and the rocks and bumps are working in your favor and it feels perfect			1
" @entity1 has been risking life and limb bombing down mountain sides for more than a decade competing in the discipline of downhill mountain biking			1
" the average mountain bike race lasts five to six minutes , which does n't sound long , but when you are hurtling down a mountain at 40 - 50 mph ( 65 - 80 kph ) and you 've got obstacles -- rocks , roots , big jumps , trees to dodge ... it 's pretty hard work ! " she explains			2
" you physically need to be strong and very fit but also you need to be able to mentally overcome challenges -- if you 're scared or a bit nervous -- and be able to put yourself in to the zone where you are willing to take the risks			2
you need to believe in yourself			0
" a family affair @entity1 took up bmx racing at the age of eight before switching to mountain bikes three years later			1
she admits to hating it at first , preferring to play netball and hockey at school , but encouraged by her two brothers she quickly became hooked on the sport			0
in 2004 , aged 16 , @entity62 clinched the @entity64 senior downhill title and four years later won her first @entity65			1
she has since gone on to amass 21 individual @entity67 downhill wins and been crowned overall @entity67 champion three times			2
" having two older brothers was amazing			0
i 've no doubt that i would n't be where i am today without having my brothers as role models , " she says of reigning downhill world champion @entity71 ( 29 ) and 32 - year - old @entity73 , who has tasted success in four - cross ( @entity76 ) races -- think ski - cross on two wheels			1
" ( it 's ) made me quite competitive			0
every time we go out riding , even if it 's just a fun ride we always end up trying to be the first to the bottom of the hill ... so it 's a really good environment to be an athlete			0
you are always striving to be the best , " she says			0
the friendly sibling rivalry has bred numerous individual wins , sometimes at the same @entity67 events			0
@entity1 and @entity71 have " done the double " a couple of times winning both men 's and women 's downhill races , but nothing will top one glorious day when all three of them stood on top of the podium			1
" the highlight of my racing career so far has got to be the 2008 @entity67 in @entity107 when @entity73 won his four - cross , @entity71 won the men 's downhill and i won the women 's downhill			1
for all three of us siblings to win the @entity67 in the same day was a tearful day ! " shouldering the pain as might be expected in such a dangerous sport , tears have been shed following more painful experiences			0
@entity1 has perhaps suffered more than most riders during her career , breaking ribs , wrists , fingers and a collarbone , as well as dislocating her shoulder seven times			1
the worst unhinging came not up a mountain , but on a road when she was hit by a pick - up truck in @entity131 during a winter training camp in january 2009			2
" there was a lot of nerve damage and i had about three or four operations over the following year to try and get me back on track			2
i had to have a nerve graft which was pretty big surgery really			0
" inevitably , the setback led to a certain amount of soul - searching about whether she wanted to carry on racing , but she eventually returned replenished both physically and mentally			2
" being injured or having time off definitely gives you something that you did n't have before			0
it gives you a real hunger and a real determination to prove to yourself that you can get back up and be as strong as you once were , " she says			0
it 's an attitude that has n't done her any harm so far with @entity1 enjoying her most successful period in the sport in recent seasons , completing the @entity65 and @entity67 double in 2013			1
@entity1 narrowly missed out on a fourth @entity67 crown this year -- she finished second to compatriot @entity155 -- but she 's setting her sights predictably high for 2015 targeting another @entity67 and @entity65 double			1
another championship - winning year would also help in her continuing quest to encourage a new generation of girl racers			2
" girls need to have the balance of being tough and getting dirty on the sports fields and then having a good time being a girl , " she said			0
" i think what i 've always tried to do in my role as being a top athlete is to show girls the confidence that sport can give you			0
it gives you such a good feeling and makes you feel strong inside			0
i think every girl should have that opportunity			0
