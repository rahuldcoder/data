-- it is a momentous day for @entity3 democracy -- but a painful one for the man who has led the former @entity6 republic for nearly a decade			2
for the first time in the strategically important former @entity6 state , power is set to be transferred by free and fair elections instead of revolution			1
as the results became clear , president @entity12 , a larger - than - life figure who was swept to power in 2003 , appeared on national television to accept defeat			2
after summing up the preliminary election results it is evident that the @entity23 coalition has achieved the advantage , he said , pledging not to hold up the process			0
but it must be a painful political blow to a man swept to power nine years ago in the popular @entity29			0
bogged down and damaged by accusations of authoritarianism and human rights abuse , including appalling images that emerged last month of prison inmates being physically and sexually abused in a @entity3 jail , his once popular support appears to have slid away			0
@entity3 's ruling party concedes defeat in parliamentary elections ambitions of @entity3 membership into the @entity42 and the @entity44 military alliance tormented @entity45 with whom @entity3 fought a brief war in 2008			1
they may be less of a priority for the new government now			0
the prime minister - elect , who will take the reigns of power from @entity12 next year , is @entity54 , a controversial 56 - year - old billionaire who made his fortune in @entity45 during the 1990s			1
with interests in iron ore , banks , pharmaceuticals and real estate , @entity54 grew up in @entity3 's rural west			1
he is now estimated by @entity62 to be the 153rd richest man in the world , with assets worth more than half of tiny @entity66			0
his eccentric tastes include a number of pet penguins he keeps in a private zoo , along with a zebra and other exotic beasts			0
a multi-million dollar art collection , including works by @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , is mainly housed in secure vaults in @entity79 , while he displays exact reproductions in his towering , @entity83 - style glass palace in @entity84 , the @entity3 capital			2
during a bitter election campaign , government officials accused him of wanting to turn his back on @entity88 , @entity44 and the @entity89 , to return @entity3 to @entity45 's sphere of influence			1
more darkly , critics accused him of being part of a @entity95 conspiracy to topple @entity3 's @entity97 leadership			1
but that is an accusation he adamantly denies , telling @entity0 he merely wants to repair shattered links with @entity101 and has no intention of turning his back on the @entity104			0
" restoring relations with the @entity95 is one of our main tasks , and we will strive in every way to do this , " he said			0
" first , we have to convince the @entity95 that our strategy towards @entity44 and @entity88 is not harmful to and does not contradict @entity45 interests , " he added			0
for its part , the @entity95 -- whose tanks still occupy two breakaway regions of @entity3 that @entity101 recognizes as independent countries -- remained tight - lipped throughout the @entity3 campaign			1
only now has there been comment from @entity45 prime minister @entity121			1
" if these results will become a reality , then [ the ] @entity3 political landscape will be more diverse , " he told @entity45 media			1
" it should be welcome because it probably means that more responsible and constructive forces are coming to the parliament , " he said			0
if that means @entity45 and @entity3 can rebuild ties without sacrificing the achievements of the past decade , this may be a momentous day in @entity3 democracy indeed .			2
