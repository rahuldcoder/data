-- if you were to take one line of dialogue in a film of 2013 to represent the year 's mood , it would be from @entity7 as @entity8 in " 12 years a slave			1
" the abducted freeman shackled into bondage is plainspoken and eloquent : " i do n't want to survive , i want to live ! " " @entity24 " may be the title of @entity14 's satire of con artists ( @entity16 and @entity17 ) aiding federal agents to carry out the @entity20 sting , but it 's also a dominant theme in @entity23 films of 2013			1
if you think hustle in its various meanings -- the swindler and the determined -- then just about every character - driven film did the hustle			1
occupying the amoral lowlands , there is @entity33 as @entity34 in " @entity35 of @entity36 " and the title figure in " @entity38 , " living large - the mansions ! the boats ! the planes ! -- by defrauding the little people			1
there is @entity44 as the @entity46 - like ex of husband - hunter @entity47 in " @entity48 , " both of them delusionary in the belief that they are entitled to other people 's money			1
and there is @entity16 in " @entity24 , " who rationalizes , " people believe what they want to believe , " indicting the suckers for their faith in his cons. up on the moral high ground , there is @entity7 in " 12 years a slave , " caught in a double bind			0
if , as an intellectual and a freeman , he defends himself against racism , he will be hung ; if he does not , he suffers the humiliations of slavery			0
@entity70 as ballplayer @entity71 in " 42 , " likewise is doubly - bound : advised to repress his righteous anger at racists or he will be brutalized and wo n't be able to play in the big leagues			1
in " @entity81 , " @entity76 , who wears one face as a @entity79 domestic and another as a family man , ultimately reconciles his two faces			0
then there is a clutch of films that collectively say forget about living , survival is enough			1
filmmakers purveyed the human hustle in stories of those facing near death challenges and variously hanging onto life by a thread , a fraying rope , a stranded lifeboat , safety tether or not			0
think of @entity104 fighting for his life in " all is lost , " @entity102 clinging to tether in " gravity , " @entity97 depending on intelligence from his wrist radio in " after @entity101 " and @entity100 facing death in a lifeboat in " @entity109			0
" also tested in a life - and - death narrative was @entity111 in the @entity113 - tinged " @entity112 : catching @entity114			2
" out of breath ? take a good , deep one			0
we have n't even begun to discuss the year 's end - of - the - world movies			1
the apocalypse was nigh -- not only in action movies like " @entity121 " and " @entity122 " but in comedies like " this is the @entity125 " and " @entity126			2
" on screen the @entity23 and @entity128 capitals were under terrorist attack in what seemed like an infinite loop of destruction : " @entity134 , " " @entity135 , " " @entity136 : retaliation , " " @entity137 : into @entity139 , " " thor : @entity140			2
" @entity141 and @entity142 also endured attacks and were defended respectively by the mettle of @entity145 in " @entity146 " and @entity147 in " @entity148			0
" what does it all mean ? we do n't need a professional to detect the pervasive anxiety in these @entity155 narratives of survival			1
might this reflect @entity158 's guilt about its role as con artist fleecing the easily duped ? or do these films in part show @entity158 's unease about its own future in a world where moviegoers are just as likely to download or stream a movie than buy a ticket for one ? perhaps this , as much as the real - life economy , explains why another theme of 2013 films is economic anxiety			1
it is symbolized in " @entity176 " by an underclass living on a polluted and overpopulated @entity101 and the 1 percent living in the pristine atmosphere above , with controlled climate and top - flight health care			1
job insecurity reverberated through a broad swath of the year 's movies			2
consider the @entity186 inspirational " @entity185 " and the ' 60s - era " @entity187 , " where the protagonists have trouble making the rent			2
consider the @entity192 hipsters in " @entity193 " to the @entity195 underclass in " @entity196 " where protagonists sought work			0
even straight - out comedies like " @entity200 , " in which a drug dealer hires underemployed individuals to pose as his family in order to make it easier to smuggle marijuana over the border , is peripherally about fewer legitimate jobs than those looking for them			2
it was n't all about angst , though , even if the laughter at the multiplex was rueful			0
" before midnight " and " @entity220 , " two superb sequels , are comic looks at relationships and fidelity			0
one is sparked by the performances of @entity223 and @entity224 , the other by an ensemble including @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229			0
the most moving relationship film of 2013 is " her , " @entity232 's wistful story of a lovesick writer ( @entity233 ) who falls in love with his operating system ( voice of @entity237 ) , and finds the chasm between human and artificial intelligence is as wide as that between @entity241 and @entity242			0
another slice of dialogue representative of movie romances comes from @entity223 , exasperated with life partner @entity224 in " before midnight : " " sometimes , i think i 'm breathing oxygen and you 're breathing helium			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			1

@entity251 : themes that 2013 movies tackled include survival , economic anxiety
@entity258 : many character - driven films featured hustlers who tried to take advantage of others
she says a number of films explored the idea : forget about living , survival is enough
@entity258 : of course , we have the usual end - of - the - world and large - scale attack movies
