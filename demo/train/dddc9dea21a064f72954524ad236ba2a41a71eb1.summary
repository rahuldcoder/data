-- when the highly anticipated " @entity1 : @entity13 " hits stores on tuesday , a naive 19 - year - old with special powers and book smarts -- but little true grasp of the complexities of the world around her -- will meet a gaming public that 's been awaiting her debut for years			1
@entity14 may be the most talked - about video game character who 's not controlled by the player since " @entity21 's " wry , sarcastic killing machine , @entity20			1
her creators were so concerned about getting her just right that she almost never happened			0
" when i first started working on her , she was horribly broken			0
there was a lot of internal opposition to her , " said @entity25 , a designer with @entity26 , the publisher behind the wildly inventive " @entity1 " franchise			0
" almost everyone in the office was saying out loud , ' we should just cut her			0
' how on @entity36 do you begin to deal with this ( type of ) character who nobody has had any experience with ? " enter the @entity42			1
so devoted was @entity26 to creating a companion character like none other that they built an entire team of developers from different areas of the company with the sole purpose of making @entity14 " real			1
" " once the creation of @entity42 became official , we had what was called the @entity55 , " @entity51 said			0
" if @entity42 , or @entity14 herself , needed something from the development team , then she got what she needed			1
" in the game 's story line , the teen @entity14 has the ability to change the world around her			1
but she 's also been locked away from the rest of that world since birth			0
as @entity69 , a former @entity70 agent , the player must rescue , or kidnap , @entity14 away from her predicament			1
the game portrays their journey together from a futuristic city in the sky into the @entity78 world of 1912			2
building off the successes of " @entity1 " and " @entity80 , " creative director @entity81 wanted to further ramp up the player 's emotional involvement in the game			1
" we kept coming back to having a partner in the experience and as we looked out onto the field of partners that existed ( in other games ) , the air gets pretty thin , " @entity81 said			0
" we wanted a character that would be absolutely central to the narrative			1
in video - game terms , that meant creating someone the player would connect with emotionally but who would also be useful to them during gameplay			1
" the biggest challenge of this entire game was n't the skylines and it was n't the open world , " said writer @entity100			2
" it was making her real because she is the game			2
if she does n't work , everything else we 've been shooing for is meaningless			0
" the realistic look and feel of @entity14 did n't fully come together until within the last year			1
but gamers who already loved the expansive , altered - reality world of the series first met her in 2011 at the @entity115 , the world 's largest video - game gathering			1
@entity81 said that demo of the game showed what @entity14 could do from a narrative standpoint , but that he still was n't comfortable with how she behaved			1
he postponed the game from its original release date of march 2012 several times , specifically because @entity14 was n't right			1
" she 's the extension of what we were trying to do with the @entity127 , which is more to me about an emotional resonance than a combat experience , " @entity81 said			2
he was referencing characters from " @entity1 " who are painted as both deadly monsters and loving companions to the " @entity136 " they protect			0
" what made the @entity127 work was the emotional impact it had on the player			2
" it seems to be working			0
when @entity14 was again revealed to the world in videos displaying her personality and emotional range , she was an instant hit			1
fans and players clamored for more and seemed to form a bond with the wayward young girl			0
so much so , in fact , that when later videos showed @entity42 in different clothing or with a different hairstyle , the outcry over the changes was swift and harsh			0
the @entity159 took that as a sign their work was on the right track			0
" the fact that people are already so concerned about what @entity14 is doing , how she 's reacting , what she 's wearing is just incredibly powerful , " @entity164 said			1
" if nobody cared , it would just be a horrible place to be			0
" emotional resonance aside , animation director @entity171 said the toughest thing to make @entity14 look and move like a real person was her dress -- which comes with a long , flowing skirt that originally would n't behave			1
" you do n't see a lot of companion characters wearing dresses -- at least not of the non-miniskirt variety , " @entity171 said			2
" @entity42 's character is important as she is a character of the time and women wore dresses then			2
we put a lot of work into the physics of the dress so it behaves correctly , the way it needs to and does n't put her in any embarrassing positions			0
" while @entity171 struggled with a dress , @entity100 , the writer , said his greatest task was making gamers ultimately care as much about the teen companion as her creators did			2
" she was the hardest thing we could have possibly tried to do , " he said			0
" it 's one thing to get her in the game and get her to move around the world			2
it was another to then breathe life into her			0
" " @entity215 " will be released worldwide on tuesday , march 26 , and be available on the @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214			1
it is rated m for mature due to blood and gore , intense violence , language , mild sexual themes , and use of alcohol and tobacco .			0

@entity14 , a troubled 19 - year - old , is the emotional *centerpiece* of " @entity215 "
@entity229 wanted a unique companion character to increase emotional *investment*
the game was *delayed* more than a year to get @entity14 right
" @entity215 " will be released tuesday worldwide
