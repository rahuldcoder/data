editor 's note : @entity2 is senior lecturer in economics at @entity4			1
economist @entity2 says it 's better to cut taxes than to raise government spending			1
@entity8 , @entity9 ( @entity10 ) -- when the @entity13 administration takes office in january , it will propose a fiscal stimulus consisting of increased government spending and lower taxes			1
by all accounts , the package will be big -- at least $ 700 billion , and possibly $ 1 trillion , over two years			1
the goal will be to end or moderate the recession			0
according to the textbooks , government spending raises the demand for goods and services			1
tax cuts also spur demand by putting more income in the hands of consumers or more after - tax profits in the hands of businesses			0
is a fiscal stimulus good policy ? the answer is no if the stimulus consists of increased spending			1
the stimulus may be good policy , though , if it consists of lower taxes			1
consider first the increased spending			0
if the new spending is for projects that are beneficial for society overall , and if the private sector can not or will not undertake these projects , then the expenditure is worthwhile independent of what it does to fight the recession			1
a standard example might be repair of the interstate highway system			0
this justification for additional spending is far from compelling , however			0
no doubt some roads need repairs , but the @entity61 already spends huge amounts on its highway system			0
the @entity61 could address existing deficiencies by increasing the use of toll roads and charging drivers extra at rush hour , or by repealing prevailing wage laws that inflate construction costs			0
similar caveats apply to other proposed increases in government spending			1
research on alternative energy is fine , but government funding is likely to come with costly strings and political interference			0
a better policy is higher taxes on gasoline and other fossil fuels , which would enhance the private sector 's incentive to undertake such research			0
additional spending on education makes sense in some cases , but the level of spending is already substantial			0
improvements in education are more likely to come from expanded school choice and elimination of policies that limit efficiency , such as rigid hiring and firing rules negotiated by unions			0
even if certain components of the nation 's spending are too low , nothing guarantees that new spending will be directed to these areas			0
instead , experience suggests that much will be for repairing " bridges to nowhere , " especially those located in the districts of influential legislators			0
the @entity115 argument for a spending stimulus does not , of course , assume this spending is for projects that have economic or social value			1
the theory , in fact , suggests that digging ditches and then filling them up is effective at stimulating the economy			0
this can not make sense in the long run ; government spending must be paid for with taxes , so it ultimately comes at the expense of private spending			1
projects that do not make economic sense are then pure waste			1
yet the history of government spending indicates the stimulus package will include countless zoos , aquariums , museums , parks and other pork barrel projects for which the private demand does not come close to justifying the investment			1
in many cases , these projects will persist for decades			0
even in the short - run , the economic effect of public spending is often weak since it partially crowds out private spending			1
research subsidies for green technologies , for example , mainly give private companies money for research they would otherwise undertake themselves			2
in any case , spending operates with a substantial lag , so it can kick in long after it is needed			0
the case for a spending stimulus is therefore weak			2
consider instead using tax cuts to simulate the economy			2
most tax cuts enhance economic efficiency by giving the private sector better incentives			1
reductions in the corporate income tax , for example , increase the incentives for investment , while reductions in personal income taxes raise the incentives for work and saving			1
tax cuts also stimulate demand via the standard @entity115 channels of increased disposable income for consumers and higher cash flow for businesses			0
tax cuts thus improve economic performance in the long run and the short run			2
recent analyses of past tax cuts and spending increases , moreover , suggest that cutting taxes is the more effective approach			1
any stimulus package should therefore consist mainly of tax cuts			1
whether a major tax cut is desirable depends on one 's view about the current size of government			2
for those who believe government should be at least as large as it is now , tax cuts are problematic because they add to an already dismal deficit picture			2
@entity205 and @entity206 , in particular , are projected to boost the deficit dramatically , implying higher tax rates will be required to achieve budget balance			2
rigid focus on the deficit might not be appropriate in a recession , but the long - run outlook still suggests caution about any policy that increases the current deficit			0
for those who advocate smaller government , the case for a tax cut is easier ; short - run increases in the deficit are not a major concern if government should be smaller ( and can eventually be reduced in size ) in the long run			2
if the level of spending is too high , the @entity61 can have its cake and eat it too : cut taxes now to improve efficiency and stimulate the economy and cut spending later to balance the budget			1
is the @entity61 government too large ? this is not the place to address that question , but it is the crucial issue that policymakers and society must confront			0
if the level of spending is about right , then the @entity61 must raise taxes sooner or later			2
a tax cut now therefore means an even larger increase down the line			0
the overall point is that government spending should be determined by long - run costs and benefits , while taxes should be sufficient to pay for programs that make sense on these grounds			1
concern with stabilizing the economy in the short run is understandable , but it often generates policies that are counterproductive over the long haul			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity13 administration planning big economic stimulus package
he says the choice is whether to spend more or to tax less
cutting taxes will give *people* and companies incentives to boost economy , he says
@entity2 : more government spending will fund *unnecessary* or pork barrel projects
