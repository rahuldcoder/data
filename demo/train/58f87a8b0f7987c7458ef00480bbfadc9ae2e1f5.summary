-- my relationship with the who - should - play - @entity5 timeline goes as follows : i wanted @entity6 the entire time i read the @entity5 trilogy ... right up until @entity9 was announced			1
then i inexplicably got very excited for @entity9 's portrayal of the troubled billionaire			2
and now that @entity9 has dropped out of the film , i 'm left feeling 50 shades of empty and confused			2
do i want @entity6 again ? or do i want someone like @entity9 , with a lesser - known face ( or one that 's usually covered in hair ) ? before i could make sense of any of it , i read that @entity19 told @entity20 that @entity21 was his choice for the coveted role			1
at first , my thoughts reflected my feelings about @entity26 being @entity27 : no , thank you			2
but after some soul searching and many @entity30 , i ca n't help but think @entity21 would make one intriguing @entity5			1
it 's definitely a film i would see , and here 's why it would work : he 's got those eyes			2
if you want to be literal about it , @entity21 does have some gorgeous blue - gray eyes			1
and he almost has that copper hair @entity39 wrote of so fondly			2
i 'll be the first to admit that his heartthrob phase is behind him , but at the end of the day , @entity21 is still quite pretty			1
plus , he 's always stayed in good shape , and getting @entity45 's abs is just a matter of a good personal trainer and a few months of dieting			2
he 's good at dark - and - twisted			0
@entity5 is a tortured soul			1
his journey is a dark one , and his obsessions all stem from a very raw , emotional place			0
and if @entity21 can do anything , it 's play a character that is so layered and broken down and yet puts up this playboy front for the crowd ( @entity57 , anyone ? )			1
let 's keep it real here : @entity5 can be one scary dude , whether he 's defending @entity63 or punishing her , and that aggressive side of a character is another element @entity21 is darn good at â € ” even when the veins are n't popping out of his forehead			1
he would give the film a certain credibility			0
no one can deny that seeing @entity21 's name on the @entity5 poster would add an additional level of credibility to the film , both in that the standard of acting would automatically increase , and @entity21 's acceptance would mean that the role intrigued him			1
and to be honest , i can see how it would			0
the books might be considered soft porn to some , but @entity45 really is a fascinating character , if you 're able to look past the exterior			0
he would expand the film 's audience			0
much like i argued that @entity9 would bring in a new @entity94 audience , @entity21 's universal appeal would reach out to many more than just those who read the books			1
he 's a great romantic lead			0
@entity45 has many sides as a character , and one of those is extremely romantic			0
and if @entity102 taught us something ( other than to stay away from icebergs ) , it 's that @entity21 is very good at being the romantic leading man , even one with a twisted mind			1
i know he 's a bit old , but this is @entity110 , people			0
and have you seen him in a suit ? although i by no means expect this casting to happen , it certainly expanded my views on who could play @entity45			0
what about you ? are you still waiting on @entity6 , or are you ready to accept the next twist thrown at you ? see the original story at @entity0			0
