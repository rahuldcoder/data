-- @entity1 stood in solidarity with his adoptive father , @entity3 , while a grand jury investigated multiple allegations of child rape against the former @entity8 assistant football coach			1
@entity1 told the grand jury nothing inappropriate had ever happened to him			2
and he sat with the rest of the family early in @entity3 's recent trial			1
but last week brought a bombshell that shook the proceedings : @entity1 , 33 , was now willing to testify that the man he first met through the @entity17 charity repeatedly molested him while he was a child , according to @entity1 's lawyers			1
the revelation kept @entity3 from taking the stand in his own defense			1
@entity3 's son fits pattern of other alleged victims portions of a 29 - minute interview police had with @entity1 during the middle of the trial were broadcast tuesday on @entity29 , which obtained the audiotape			1
jurors never heard the tape			0
detectives asked @entity1 why he was now willing to cooperate			2
" i mean for my family so that they can really have closure and see what the truth actually is , " @entity1 said			2
" and just to right the wrong , honestly , of going to the grand jury and lying			0

" i know that i really wanted to die at that point and time , " he said , according to the audio obtained by @entity45			2
@entity1 , a foster child formally adopted at 18 , also described @entity3 rubbing , hugging and showering with him			1
" if you were pretending you were asleep and if you were touched or rubbed in some way you could just act like you were rolling over in your sleep , so that you could change positions , " said @entity1			2
the defendant would sometimes rub near and against his genitals , he told police			0
the potential witness said he could not recall penetration or oral sex			0
it was only days before the commonwealth rested , and after some alleged victims had testified , according to @entity1 's lawyers , that he told them he was abused and wanted to cooperate with prosecutors			2
the younger @entity1 's willingness to testify as a rebuttal witness created a dilemma for @entity3 's defense team			1
they wanted their client to testify after the jury heard damning testimony from eight alleged victims , but they decided it against it			2
attorney : @entity1 to appeal child sex abuse convictions " to put @entity3 on the stand and have @entity1 come in and testify against him it would destroy any chance of an acquittal , " co-defense counsel @entity76 told reporters friday night after his client was convicted of 45 of 48 sexual abuse charges against him			1

the younger @entity1 's attorneys , @entity89 and @entity90 , released a statement about the recording			2
" this tape demonstrates @entity1 's tremendous courage and strength as he begins to disclose that @entity3 sexually abused him when he was a child , " they said			1
" although the tape was released without @entity1 's knowledge or permission , it illustrates that he made the difficult decision to come forward and tell the painful truth to investigators despite extraordinary pressure to support his father			1
" the audiotape 's leak was the main subject of a meeting hastily called tuesday by trial judge @entity112 and attended by prosecutors , defense attorneys and even the judge who has overseen the grand jury that 's investigated the @entity1 case , a source with knowledge of the meeting told @entity0 national correspondent @entity118			1
no one at the meeting took responsibility for sharing the tape with the media , the source told @entity0			0
@entity3 's defense team was asked to turn over its copy of the tape , but it will remain available to them			1
@entity112 ordered that any discovery turned over to the defense in the @entity1 case be sealed unless it was put into evidence at trial			1
he also said defense attorneys shall give a sworn statement within 10 days as to what materials they received and who they have given it to			0
the judge is trying to protect the current investigation and the privacy of the victims and witnesses			0
neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys , who have vowed an appeal , would comment on tuesday 's meeting			0
@entity1 's grand jury testimony remains a secret			1
