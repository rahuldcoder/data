-- several weeks ago , president @entity1 announced that $ 8 billion in government - loan guarantees would be made available to @entity3 to begin construction of two nuclear reactors in @entity6			1
if built , it would be the first nuclear power plant constructed in the @entity9 in almost 30 years			1
more importantly , this would be the first of what is expected to be many such projects initiated in coming years			0
i am a big believer in the necessity for energy independence			0
i accept that we will all have to make some compromises in achieving that goal			2
i am willing to consider that nuclear power may have to be one piece of the plan we put together for how to break ourselves free from our dependence on foreign oil			1
i would submit , however , that before we start building reactors we need to address another urgent matter			0
we need to make current reactors secure			1
roughly 18 months ago i started work on a project that ultimately lead to the writing of my recently published book , " @entity34 , " on homeland security in the @entity9			1
i examined security at a wide range of potential targets inside the @entity9 , including chemical plants , liquefied natural gas facilities , biological research laboratories and nuclear power plants			1
this was not a theoretical study			0
i did my homework up front , but after that , i went out on the street and i did what my 20 years in the @entity47 had trained me to do			2
i looked at all these targets in the same way as an adversary would			0
what i found was deeply disturbing			0
eight years after 9/11 , we had done little or nothing to enhance security in most areas			2
nuclear power plants were no exception			1
security at nuclear power plants is in the hands of private security companies hired to protect the facilities by the power companies that own them			1
before 9/11 , the @entity66 mandated that there would be five to 10 private security guards on duty at each site per shift			2
after 9/11 that number was increased			0
on average , there are now a total of 20 such security personnel on duty at any one time to guard a nuclear power plant			1
that is 20 individuals to secure the entire perimeter and interior of what may be a vast facility			2
these guards are grossly underpaid			0
in many cases , they make less than the janitors at the facilities in question			2
they train with their weapons no more than two to three times a year			0
some of them are prior military and have combat experience			0
many others are hired off the street and given less than a week 's worth of training before they begin to stand post			0
much of that week of training is consumed with administrative matters , which have nothing to do with learning how to repel a terrorist attack			1
morale among the guards at nuclear power plants is chronically low			1
i was told by many individuals during my research that it was common to hear discussions among guards about where they would hide if there were an attack			2
these guard forces are typically trained to respond to a limited number of scenarios			1
these scenarios are always designed around attacks by very small numbers and are artificially constrained so as to not allow these attackers to use many weapons , such as rocket launchers and machine guns , commonly in use by terrorist groups today			2
even so , the guard forces are defeated at least half the time			2
these deficiencies have been pointed out for years by any number of watchdog organizations			0
likewise , detailed recommendations have been put forth regarding how to improve the situation and increase the size and ability of power plant guard forces			1
these include requiring them to demonstrate the capacity to repel attacks by teams of terrorists using the weapons and tactics commonly in use around the world today			0
these have been largely ignored			0
an interest in nuclear power plants by @entity149 or another terrorist group is not theoretical			1
among the targets considered for the 9/11 attacks were nuclear power plants			1
@entity155 security forces recently captured a suspected member of @entity149 , a @entity158 native named @entity159			1
between 2002 and 2008 , he worked at several @entity9 nuclear power plants			1
it does not take a counterterrorism expert to imagine what @entity149 might be able to do with the knowledge supplied by an individual who had spent the better part of six years inside nuclear facilities			0
the stakes here are enormous			0
a team of terrorists , which was able to seize control of a nuclear power plant , could cause it to melt down with relatively basic knowledge of the plant 's operation			1
a full - scale meltdown of a major reactor would be catastrophic			0
such an incident at the @entity181 in @entity182 , for instance , would likely render large parts of the metropolitan @entity185 area uninhabitable for decades and likely kill tens of thousands			0
we have neglected this issue for too long			0
it needs to be addressed , and the decision to push the building of reactors simply adds urgency			0
before we move ahead with any new nuclear power plants , let 's attend to unfinished business and fix security at the ones we have			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2

@entity1 administration is backing *expansion* of nuclear power
@entity205 says @entity9 should first make existing plants secure
he says security forces are *n't* well - trained or numerous enough to counter threats
@entity199 : a terrorist attack at a nuclear plant could have dire consequences
