-- toss that basic black and indulge in a fashion fantasy this year			0
we asked the four gorgeous stars of @entity5 's new tv show " @entity6 " to take part in a little experiment : if you could slip into a different guise for a day , what would it be ? @entity14 in @entity15 silk gown , @entity16 and @entity17 rhodium - plated earrings with @entity20 crystals			1
@entity14 glams it up understated when it comes to her own style and buttoned up in banker stripes as @entity25 on @entity6 , @entity14 , 40 , has been hankering for an infusion of pure glamour			1
" i love the idea of wearing a dress that 's a work of art in itself , " says the actress , who slipped easily into a red - carpet fantasy with a mouthwatering cherry - hued gown by @entity15			1
@entity14 's " safety first " approach to fashion means living mostly in simple @entity37 pieces , but it 's a sensibility that does n't offer much in the way of frippery -- which suits her just fine			2
" i do n't like to stand out too much , " says the willowy @entity45 - @entity44 beauty			0
still , @entity15 's fluttering cascades of silk offer both a role reversal and a respite			2
" a fantasy has to move you to feel like a different person , " she says			0
" that 's fun for a day			2
then i like to put my jeans back on and go home			0
" @entity57 relives the forties few decades enthrall @entity57 like the 1940s			1
" i like the idea of updating a traditional silhouette from that era in a fresh way , " says @entity57 , whose character , @entity61 , reigns over a @entity63 publishing fiefdom in power looks by @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
despite its abstract floral print , the ruffled organza dress by @entity73 would seem right at home on the cover of a @entity77 - period glossy , yet @entity57 imbues it with a distinctly modern verve			1
" there was something really elegant and erotic about women back then , with their girdles and cinched - in waists , " she says			0
on the set the 39 - year - old star relishes watching costume designer @entity86 work her sartorial sorcery with a swirl of offbeat textures and trimmings			0
" the other day my character was wearing a gold lamé striped dress with a coffee - hued belt , black leggings and green earrings			2
it 's contagious , " says @entity57 , who finds herself mixing -- and not matching -- more freely these days			1
@entity97 indulges in gems famous for playing a @entity100 maiden in the @entity102 movies , @entity44 actress @entity97 found herself dressing a little like one offscreen too , in muted , ethereal garb			1
but her arctic complexion and fiery tresses are the perfect canvas on which to throw splashes of drama			0
" shooting @entity6 [ the 40 - year - old beauty plays steely hotelier @entity110 ] has made me lust for accessories , " she says			1
presto : @entity115 is resplendent in scads of jewelry			1
" wearing stacks of the stuff makes it more interesting , " she adds			2
there 's just one catch to donning such beguiling accents : " my 2 - year - old daughter , @entity125 , wants everything			2
" @entity127 goes for fifties bombshell @entity127 longs for the bygone days when women were perennially polished			1
" in the fifties you 'd never leave the house without your hair done , your face on , and a nice dress			0
me , i have my staple uniform of jeans , tank tops and flats			0
" to resolve her clothing ennui , the actress chose a dazzling yellow @entity143 number that is equal parts @entity146 and @entity148 socialite			0
" it 's something i never thought i could wear for daytime , " says the @entity149 , @entity63 - bred singer and actress who plays @entity153 's trendy cosmetics exec , @entity154			1
a skinny metallic belt gives the look more of a now vibe			0
" on the show , with everything we wear , @entity86 says , ' put a belt on it ! ' " says @entity127 , 33			2
" now i 'm buying belts in my real life , which i never did before			0
