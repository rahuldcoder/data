@entity1 , @entity0 -- in sport , being the best is not just about the having the greatest players			0
here are five teams that have gone from zeroes to heroes , and in the process left their mark on sporting history			0
the @entity14 @entity13 team the 1980 @entity17 hockey team 's ' @entity15 ' against the @entity18			1
@entity20 's @entity13 team has become renowned for upsetting the form book , frequently triumphing against higher ranked @entity17 opposition			1
since @entity14 players were first allowed to join the @entity25 and @entity26 team for the famous golf tournament ( to improve the level of competition ) in 1979 , the @entity17 has won six times ; @entity20 seven ; and the teams have tied once			1
the slight edge enjoyed by @entity20 , however , belies the lowly status of their players in world golf			2
for the last tournament two years ago in @entity26 , for example , the @entity17 boasted 68.4 world - ranking points and the top three players , including world number one , @entity42			2
compare this with just 47.8 ranking points for the @entity14			0
even so @entity20 went on to achieve a record third consecutive win			2
the key to this success has been the camaraderie and teamwork exhibited by the @entity14			0
their players have consistently rallied around their position as underdog , managing to achieve a level of togetherness made all the more surprising since the team is made up of a collection of nationalities that are better known for falling out with each other			0
the 1980 @entity17 @entity61 ice hockey team a famous victory against a seemingly invincible @entity18 side propelled this team of college players and amateurs to the level of national heroes			1
although the @entity17 team went on to win the gold medal by defeating @entity72 at the @entity73 , it was the earlier match against the @entity18 that captured the popular imagination			1
classed as amateurs , the @entity18 players were essentially professional , and were provided with different job titles by the communist government to allow them to compete			2
many of their players were considered legends of world ice hockey at the time			1
the @entity17 team coached by @entity83 was , by contrast , genuinely amateur and came into the tournament in @entity86 , @entity87 , as rank outsiders			2
their youthfulness and tenacity combined with patriotic home support saw them upset predictions , defeating the @entity18 4 - 3 in a match that became known as the " @entity15			1
" the win over their @entity97 enemies seized the imagination of the @entity17 public -- it inspired two films and was voted the greatest sporting moment of the 20th century by @entity103			2
@entity104 , former executive director of @entity105 , called the victory " the most transcending moment in the history of our sport in this country			0
the ' @entity113 ' defeat @entity114 in the @entity115 nobody expected lowly @entity117 to do anything other than turn up when they played @entity114 in the 1988 fa cup final at @entity121			1
dubbed the ' @entity113 ' by @entity25 media because of the eccentric antics of their players and staff , who included future film actor @entity128 , the team was outclassed on every front			0
at the time @entity114 were the dominant force in @entity0 football , having won the league title that year for the seventh time in a decade			0
managed by former player @entity135 and boasting a host of stars , the team was expected to cruise past @entity117 , who had little resources and were considered something of a joke			2
under the chairmanship of @entity145 businessman @entity144 , @entity117 earned a reputation for bizarre behaviour , with players setting fire to new signings football kits , and @entity144 once offering to buy a camel for the team 's striker if he scored 20 goals in a season			1
the practical jokes helped to foster an extraordinarily strong team spirit , however , which saw them topple @entity114 1 - 0 , with @entity117 captain @entity160 the hero of the hour after he saved a penalty			1
@entity164 's @entity163 win the @entity165 when the @entity163 took on the @entity167 in the 1969 @entity165 , it was the team from @entity168 that was strong favorites			1
the @entity167 had stormed the @entity171 ( @entity171 ) championship , considered at the time a much stronger competition than the @entity173 ( @entity173 ) , headed that year by the @entity163			0
this news , however , seemed to have escaped @entity175 , the @entity163 ' charismatic quarterback , who gave a " guarantee " a few days earlier at a news conference in @entity177 -- where the @entity165 was being staged -- that his team would win			1
true to his predictions , the @entity163 came out on top with @entity175 taking all the plaudits ( @entity103 described him as a " folk hero of the new generation " ) after a blistering performance that saw his team triumph 16 - 7			1
the @entity187 the legendary @entity189 national football team of the 1950s is still considered one of the greatest teams in the history of sport			0
although many of its players -- most notably striker @entity200 , who eventually moved to @entity201 -- went on to play in the @entity202 , during its heyday the majority of the team was drawn from the @entity206 club in @entity207			0
the @entity187 remained unbeaten for an unprecedented 33 consecutive matches ( a record that still stands today ) finally losing out in the 1954 @entity210 to @entity211			0
this golden age of @entity189 football was brought to an abrupt end in 1956 by the events of the @entity216			0
@entity200 and some of his team mates opted to defect to @entity20 , and never played for their country again .			0

@entity20 's @entity13 team has often beaten the @entity17 despite lower profile players
@entity17 's ice hockey win against the @entity18 is known as the " @entity15 "
@entity117 's defeat of @entity114 in the @entity115 was considered a major upset
@entity163 @entity165 win in 1969 was inspired by quarterback @entity175
