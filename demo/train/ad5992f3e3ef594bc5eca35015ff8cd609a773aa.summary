-- when our father , @entity2 , was murdered in the @entity3 , @entity4 , shooting on november 5 , 2009 , we were barraged with the question , " what can we do ? " people wanted to help , get milk , make us casserole and assist relatives with travel			1
in the wake of shootings in @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , and too many more places , people are asking again , " what can we do ? " first , we must stop asking " why ? " and start asking " why not ? " in other words , what are we doing to prevent these tragic shootings ? opinion : patterns and warning signs these events are caused by a perfect storm of issues			1
these include the proliferation of assault rifles and clips of 30 to 100 rounds , access to mental health support or lack of it , and , most important , falling short in our efforts of prevention			1
it is a sinking ship , and we must start filling the holes			2
holes made by guns that shoot 45 rounds in 1 minute , like the semi-automatic rifle used in @entity16			2
holes inspired by the glorification of the shooters in previous shootings			1
their life - size faces on the cover of @entity55 , bought by you , and dominating the internet sites you browse , while the fallen are left in the photo albums of their families			2
holes made by the lack of help and understanding in our country 's mental health			2
holes made by the fact that the @entity16 children are not the only children we have lost to mass shootings			1
they are the unfortunate 20 who made us realize the water is up to our throats			0
what hole can you fill ? can you think about prevention rather than reaction by supporting programs in our schools that encourage our children to look out for one another ? can you be honest about what it would take to defend yourself against an assault rifle ? can you pay attention to important legislation and contact your congressman and senators to show support or share your thoughts ? can you stop saying , " glad it was n't me " and start saying " what if it was me ? " we can not continue accepting that " these things happen " and " you will never stop evil			2
" those statements ensure that more innocents will die			0
our father charged a gun outfitted with 30 - round extended clips and was shot six times			1
@entity113 never let evil get the last word			0
he never looked at a problem and thought it was hopeless			0
we must do the same , and we must be honest : sacrificing our pride and admitting that we , as a nation , have a problem			0
we need training for our teachers and police officers			1
training that does n't just focus on how to react to shootings but knows the community and makes relationships that lead to safer communities			1
opinion : @entity130 , a gunmaker ripe for an ethical takeover programs such as @entity134 started after the @entity136 shooting by the parents of the first student killed , @entity138			0
the @entity139 , started after the @entity140 , which trains police officers not just to recognize danger but how to create communities that are more aware			1
" @entity149 actor " trainings , by @entity145 , teaching educators how to identify possible mass shooters , focus on at - risk kids and help those students			0
gun sales are rising , but is the support for the families affected by some of those guns and commitment to prevention rising with it ? here is the question we are haunted by : " what is wrong with us that it takes 20 children dying in one shooting to make us change ? " and some of us still wo n't			1
we have to address the answers , and we have to have the conversation			0
let 's start fixing the problem instead of treating the symptoms			0
