-- another wonder strike from in - form @entity3 winger @entity2 proved enough to give @entity5 a narrow 1 - 0 @entity7 semifinal first leg win over @entity8 , in a match which saw both sides reduced to 10 men			1
@entity2 , who scored a hat - trick in @entity5 's 7 - 0 thrashing of @entity14 , continued where he left off last weekend by scoring the only goal in the 69th minute			1
picking the ball up 25 yards from goal , @entity2 's impressive strike took a slight deflection off the head of teammate @entity22 to wrong - foot goalkeeper @entity23			2
@entity5 were the better of the two sides , but they suffered an early setback when midfielder @entity26 , whose name has been linked to an alleged sex scandal in his native @entity29 , was sent off for a late challenge on @entity31 in the 37th minute			0
@entity26 lunged in with studs showing , catching @entity33 on his ankle , and @entity36 referee @entity35 had no hesitation in producing a straight red card , meaning the @entity29 will now miss the second leg in @entity8 next week			0
however , nine minutes after the break , @entity8 's man advantage disappeared when @entity42 , who had been booked for a foul on @entity2 just three minutes earlier , was shown a second yellow card for a high challenge			2
@entity8 had endured a long trip by road and rail to get to @entity50 and , like @entity51 in @entity52 24 hours earlier , they appeared tired and lethargic throughout the majority of the match .			0

@entity5 defeat @entity8 1 - 0 in the first leg of their @entity7 semifinal
in - form @entity2 scores the only goal with a *spectacular* long - range strike
@entity26 and @entity42 are sent off as both team finish with 10 men
