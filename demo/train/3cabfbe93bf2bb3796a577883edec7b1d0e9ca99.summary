-- it would be no exaggeration to say that we spend the 89 minutes of " @entity4 " waiting -- taut with tension -- to see a face			1
not just any face , mind you			2
a face of nightmare terror and shivery awe , one that will shoot a scary volt of revelation right through us			2
we 're never entirely sure if that face is going to arrive , but the anticipation is everything			2
the movie sets us up for it early on , with an amazing shock as a closet door is opened			1
of course , we 're also waiting because , with two other " @entity25 " films behind it , " @entity4 " implicitly understands that we 've been through enough tricks in these movies -- the doors that open and slam shut , the thuds and booms and scratchy skitters on the soundtrack , the kitchen utensils that fall with a crash , the spectral shapes that you can almost make out -- to now want to see something more			1
" @entity4 " features variations on every one of the tricks i just mentioned , and a few additional ones ( they all work ) , but more than the first two films , it tweaks our desire to put a face on evil			1
the movie is a prequel , set in september 1988 , though it does n't exactly look like an ' 80s period piece			1
the spacious , high - ceilinged @entity52 , @entity53 , tract home in which it takes place looks a lot like the one in the more contemporary " @entity56 , " with tastefully bland furniture that might have come out of the @entity59 suburban - gothic collection			2
this time , the family consists of @entity61 ( @entity62 , who 's like a skinny young @entity63 ) , a wedding videographer who has banks of monitors and editing equipment in his home studio ; his big - haired sexy wife , @entity69 ( @entity70 ) ; and her two preteen daughters from a previous marriage			0
they are @entity74 ( @entity75 ) , who will grow up to be the @entity77 character in the first film , and angel - faced @entity79 ( @entity80 ) , from " @entity56 , " here an enigmatic child who can communicate with the spirit world			1
it 's one of this haunted - house movie 's best jokes that the ghost on hand is @entity79 's invisible friend , '' @entity84 , '' whom she talks to with a mixture of intimacy and intimidated formality			2
as soon as the family begins to hear mysterious sounds in their new home , @entity61 insists on rigging up a handful of video cameras as makeshift surveillance devices			0
we get time - coded views of the parents ' and kids ' bedrooms -- and , most cleverly , there 's a camera mounted on the base of a rotating fan that pans back and forth , with fearful deliberation , from the kitchen , with its pristine white cabinets , to the living room , with its creepy looped lamp in the foreground			0
the directors , @entity117 and @entity118 , are the fascinatingly deadpan pranksters who made " @entity119 , " last year 's is - it - a - documentary - or - a - rigged - stunt ? investigation into the fake identities that people can forge on the @entity124			0
they turn out to be the perfect filmmakers to create a banal surface reality that 's just warped enough to keep us on tenterhooks			0
the bottom line , for me , is this : i do n't scare easily at horror films ( that 's one of the reasons i tend to pan them ) , but i watched " @entity4 " in a state of high anxiety			1
@entity117 and @entity135 have fun with the archetypal image of a white - sheeted costume ghost , but mostly what they 're aces at is timing			0
they know just how to thread a handheld camera up the stairs , down a hallway , and into the scattered @entity146 of a middle - class children 's bedroom , settling at just the right moment upon a talking teddy bear that plays as a joke , even as a part of you momentarily thinks : is that bear possessed ? they also make terrific use of characters like @entity61 's assistant , a @entity161 type , played with an infectious spark by @entity163 , who ends up huddling in a darkened bathroom with young @entity74 for a scary game of '' @entity166 '' ( say it three times and wait to see what happens )			1
there 's no denying that the " @entity4 " films adhere , by now , to a formula ; this one , almost by definition , lacks the originality that made the first one so startling			1
but when you consider how the grimy , mangle-fest " @entity179 " sequels have ruled the @entity181 season in recent years , it 's refreshing to think that the spook - show franchise that has now caught the popular imagination has replaced depravity and sadism with a 21st - century , video - reality version of old - school campfire shivers			0
in her review of " @entity190 , " @entity188 asked -- derisively -- '' who wants to see evil in daylight , through a wide - angle lens ? '' the answer , it turns out , is everybody			0
