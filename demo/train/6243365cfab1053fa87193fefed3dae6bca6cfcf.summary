-- the archbishop of @entity2 , @entity3 , apologized repeatedly tuesday night for the way his archdiocese handled an abusive priest and he defended the @entity7 which has come under fire for not disciplining or defrocking the man			1
" mistakes were made in the @entity16 case , " said archbishop @entity10 at the end of a special holy week mass at @entity13 in @entity2			1
" the mistakes were not made in @entity18 in 1996 , 1997 and 1998			0
the mistakes were made here , in the @entity24 of @entity2 , in the 1970s , the 1980s and the 1990s , by the @entity19 , by civil authorities , by @entity19 officials , and by bishops			0
and for that , i beg your forgiveness in the name of the @entity19 and in the name of this @entity24 of @entity2			0
" the now - deceased @entity16 is believed to have molested up to 200 boys			1
the @entity7 says it did not know about the abuse until 20 years after civil authorities investigated and later dropped the case			1
however , a recent @entity36 story alleged that top @entity7 officials , including the future pope @entity38 , failed to act despite warnings from several @entity41 bishops			1
@entity42 , a lawyer who obtained internal church paperwork , said it " shows a direct line from the victims through the bishops and directly to the man who is now pope			0
" in his comments tuesday night , @entity10 attempted to shift the blame away from the @entity38			0
" the holy father does not need me to defend him or his decisions , " he said			0
" i believe , and history will confirm , that his actions in responding to this crisis swiftly and decisively and his compassionate response to victims ( and ) survivors speak for themselves			0
" @entity10 added that measures have now been put in place in his diocese and across the country to protect children from predatory priests			0
" still , we know it is not words , but actions that will demonstrate our resolve , " he said			0
" and , in some ways , regardless of what i say tonight or any other time , our critics will say it is not enough			0
" but that can not and will not prevent me from making every possible effort at moving forward toward healing and resolution with those who have been harmed , and determined to make sure nothing like this can ever happen again			0
" the apologies are little consolation to many of the victims , three of whom shared their stories on " @entity87 " tuesday night			0
" these priests have been allowed to abuse children for years			2
and with the man who is now the pope knowing about what @entity92 alone was doing , and not doing anything about it ? he needs to resign			0
he has no business being in the position he is in , " said @entity96 , who said he was abused once during one of @entity16 's regular visits to the @entity99 , a juvenile detention center in @entity101 in northern @entity3			1
most of the alleged abuse took place at the @entity108 for the @entity109 in @entity110 where @entity16 began as a teacher in 1950			1
he was promoted to run the school in 1963 in spite of the fact that students had warned church officials of molestation , according to documents that @entity0 has seen			0
@entity119 said his abuse began when he was 12 and continued up until he was 20 , about 50 or 60 times			2
he did n't know if he should tell anyone , " said @entity122 , who interpreted for @entity119 during his appearance on @entity125 's show			2
" he felt like @entity16 was so powerful that he could n't do anything , " she said			1
local coverage from @entity0 affiliate @entity131 still , @entity119 and two other classmates eventually reported @entity16 to the @entity2 police			1
" they did nothing , " said @entity134 , who said he was abused three times			0
three successive archbishops in @entity3 were told of the abuse , but none reported it to criminal or civil authorities , said @entity42 , who is representing five men who are suing the archdiocese			2
the @entity24 of @entity2 , however , said that abuse was reported in fall 1973 to @entity2 police , who turned the report over to @entity110 police , but no charges were filed			2
@entity16 was removed in may 1974 as director of the @entity152 for the @entity109 , but remained as fundraiser and alumni director until summer 1974 , when he was removed from any role at the school , according to a chronology posted on the archdiocese web site			1
in august 1974 , a series of newspaper articles in the @entity161 reported on @entity16 's removal and the allegations , the chronology said			1
a district attorney reviewed the allegations against @entity16 in fall 1974			2
a civil lawsuit was filed in 1975 against the archdiocese relating to @entity16 , but was resolved the following year , the chronology said			1
the @entity7 's @entity170 , the office led by cardinal @entity38 who would later become pope , " was not informed of the matter until some 20 years later , " said @entity7 spokesman father @entity168			1
the office is in charge of deciding whether accused priests should be given canonical trials and defrocked			2
but as part of his lawsuit , @entity42 obtained correspondence from @entity2 to @entity38 and other internal church documents			0
the documents , dating back to 1974 , include letters between bishops and the @entity7 , victims ' affidavits , the handwritten notes of an expert on sexual disorders who interviewed @entity16 and minutes of a final @entity7 meeting on the case			1
@entity38 failed to respond to two letters about the case in 1996 from @entity2 's then - archbishop , @entity192			2
after eight months , cardinal @entity194 , who at the time was second - in - command of the doctrinal office and now is the @entity7 's secretary of state , told @entity3 bishops to begin a secret canonical trial , the documents show			1
by that time , @entity16 was in poor health , living in seclusion and had not had any allegations of abuse levied against him for more than 20 years , the @entity2 archbishop said			1
the @entity170 suggested that the archbishop restrict @entity16 's public ministry and require him to accept full responsibility for his acts			1
@entity16 died four months later			2
" even though some do not want to hear it or accept it as truth , mistakes were made by law enforcement , medical professionals -- even reporters who helped bring initial stories to light and grappled with how to deal with perpetrators , " @entity10 said tuesday night			0
" we have all learned so much			0
