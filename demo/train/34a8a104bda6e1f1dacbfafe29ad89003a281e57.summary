@entity0 -- secretary of state @entity2 got the money shot he wanted on tuesday -- the chief negotiators for @entity5 and the @entity6 framed by his lanky embrace as they shook hands to launch " sustained , continuous and substantive " talks on a long - sought @entity11 peace treaty			1
now the question is whether the negotiations expected to last nine months will bring an even more historic image , with president @entity15 bringing together @entity5 prime minister @entity16 and @entity6 president @entity17 to sign a final - status agreement that creates a sovereign @entity6 state in what is now part of @entity5			1
the @entity11 dispute , perhaps the world 's most intractable in the past six decades , entered a new phase with @entity2 's announcement that the first direct talks in three years would proceed in earnest in the next two weeks in either @entity5 or the @entity6 territories			1
flanked by @entity5 justice minister @entity29 and @entity6 chief negotiator @entity30 , @entity2 said " all core issues " toward achieving a two - state solution would be on the table			1
" our objective will be to achieve a final status agreement over the course of the next nine months , " he said			1
acknowledging the obstacles from years of hostility and mistrust , @entity2 said the process would be difficult but that he believed an agreement could be achieved			1
" when somebody tells you that @entity5 and @entity6 can not find common ground or address the issues that divide them , do n't believe them , " @entity2 said , adding : " while i understand the skepticism , i do n't share it and i do n't think we have time for it			1
" major obstacles that date back decades in the @entity11 conflict include established @entity53 settlements in territory claimed by the @entity6 , the status of @entity6 refugees seeking to return to the region , and control of @entity59 , particularly its @entity61 holy sites			1
opinion : @entity2 's bold push for peace @entity2 has pushed to resume negotiations in order to stave off a showdown over the @entity5 - @entity6 question at the @entity69 in september			1
his efforts , including multiple meetings in the region with each side in recent months , sought to assure the @entity5 that their security concerns would be addressed while convincing @entity6 that an agreement was in their best long - term interest			1
" i think that everyone involved here believes that we can not pass along to another generation the responsibility of ending a conflict that is in our power to resolve in our time , " @entity2 said			2
" they should not be expected to bear that burden and we should not leave it to them			0
they should not be expected to bear the pain of continued conflict or perpetual war			0
" on tuesday , president @entity15 held a 30 - minute meeting with the negotiators in which he " underscored that while the parties have much work to do in the days and months ahead , the @entity97 stands ready to support them in their efforts to achieve peace , " @entity94 spokesman @entity93 told reporters			0
both sides face opposition to the negotiations from their people , with hardliners calling the concept of negotiations an unacceptable climate of concession			0
in comments after @entity2 's announcement , @entity29 and @entity30 expressed gratitude for his efforts to get the talks going			1
@entity30 cited both @entity2 and @entity15 " for your relentless efforts and unwavering commitment to achieve a just and lasting peace between @entity6 and @entity5			1
" " palestinians have suffered enough and no one benefits more from a lasting peace than @entity6 , " he said , expressing delight that all core issues were on the table			2
it was time for @entity6 to have a sovereign state , he added			1
@entity29 praised @entity2 " for not giving up , " adding that " we are hopeful but we can not be @entity131			2
" " we all know that it 's not going to be easy			0
it 's going to be hard , with ups and downs , " she said , calling for the new talks to be " a spark of hope , even if small , to emerge out of cynicism and pessimism			0
" to help set up the revived talks , @entity16 prodded the @entity5 government into approving the release of 104 @entity6 prisoners -- a move that flies in the face of popular sentiment in @entity5			1
some observers called the prisoner release to be done in stages a possible sign of a new negotiating environment			0
another sign of a different atmosphere was @entity2 's declaration that both sides agreed to negotiate in private			2
the @entity97 will be a facilitator and a senior @entity161 official called it an " indispensable role			0
" but the talks are direct negotiations between the two sides			0
" the only announcement you will hear about meetings it 's the one that i just made , and i will be the only one by agreement authorized to comment publicly on the talks in consultation obviously with the parties			1
" that means that no one should consider any reports , articles or even rumors reliable unless they come directly from me and i guarantee you they wo n't			0
" @entity184 of the @entity185 , a @entity11 specialist , said such " radio silence " was unprecedented for @entity11 negotiations in his memory			0
" it 's a mark of real seriousness on one hand and respect for @entity2 on the other , " @entity184 told @entity1			0
@entity195 : barriers to @entity5 peace less now , says president @entity198 opponents of the peace talks insist that divisions remain too deep to overcome			2
dating back to the creation of @entity5 in 1947 , the @entity11 conflict has spawned a tortuous peace process that yielded iconic images but no satisfactory solution			0
one of the most famous photos was the 1993 shot of president @entity209 looking on as @entity5 prime minister @entity210 and @entity212 leader @entity211 shook hands over an agreement intended to bring a full peace treaty by 1999			2
@entity210 was assassinated two years later later by a @entity53 law student who said he wanted to halt the peace process			0
@entity29 referred to the failure of previous peace efforts in her comments tuesday , saying " it 's not our intention to argue about the past , but to create solutions and make decisions about the future			0
" the newest round of talks began monday night with an @entity229 dinner to break the fast in the @entity61 holy month of @entity231 , then continued tuesday morning with negotiators also meeting with @entity15 before joining @entity2 for the announcement that took place an hour later than scheduled			2
@entity29 and attorney @entity235 , an aide to @entity16 , represented @entity5 while @entity30 and @entity237 official @entity236 spoke for the @entity6			1
former @entity97 ambassador to @entity5 @entity239 also took part as the @entity97 envoy to the talks			2
opinion : @entity97 , stay open to both sides in @entity11 talks @entity1 's @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			0
