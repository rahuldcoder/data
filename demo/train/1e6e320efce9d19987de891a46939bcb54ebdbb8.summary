-- twenty years ago , singer / songwriter @entity1 signed a lucrative recording deal with @entity3 and subsequently released her seminal recording " @entity5			1
" the critically acclaimed work led @entity7 to proclaim her " @entity8			2
" " i was shocked because i 've always thought @entity14 was @entity15 's best singer , " the two - time @entity10 winner recently told @entity0 from her home in @entity12 , @entity13			1
" now if i was to vote on that , i would still say it 's @entity14			1
" as modest as she 's being , the blond , dreadlock - coiffed song stylist is , indeed , in a league of her own			1
nine albums ( seven solo studio recordings ) by @entity23 have been released on the storied record label since then , she 's remained an in - demand concert headliner globally , and she shares in the @entity27 - winning glory of fellow @entity30 native and jazz great @entity28 for the 1997 jazz oratorio " @entity32			1
" but that was then and this is now			2
shortly after releasing her 2010 opus , " @entity37 , " @entity23 and her longtime label parted ways			1
this week her latest , " @entity43 " -- a guitar - laden collection of music -- was released through her own record label , @entity41 , via @entity42			1
from a creative and business standpoint , it 's quite a departure from what she 's grown accustomed to			1
" i 'm sure you 're aware of all the stuff that @entity3 had been going through and switching owners , " @entity23 said			2
" all of this speculation of what was going to happen , so it was time for me to make that move			2
" " i think the independent way is much more flexible , " she added			2
" i was lucky to find ( @entity42 honcho ) @entity60 because he 's the same kind of record industry man as ( @entity3 's chairman emeritus ) @entity63			1
i 've talked at length with @entity63 about this decision and he gave me his blessing , he said @entity60 was a great guy			2
and when i sat down and talked with him , i got the same feeling			2
so i feel very fortunate			2
" " @entity43 " is not a country / western hybrid in the vein of what @entity74 's " @entity72 , " from earlier this year			1
it literally was recorded in another country -- @entity77			1
" that was the first time that i recorded in @entity79 , " @entity23 shared			1
" we decided that it made sense and that it was cost - effective to record in @entity77 because i was already over there and just finished up a tour			1
we were able to do it fairly easily			0
and we got these apartments on the @entity86 ( in @entity87 ) and we were there for 10 days and it was absolutely exquisite			0
" the project reunited her with producer @entity91 , with whom she worked with on " @entity93 " 10 years ago			1
" what happens with jazz artists is that you always have to keep bringing something new to your audience , you have to keep in touch with your audience and take them along on the journey , because the journey does n't stop until you close your eyes , " @entity23 said			0
the singer takes on the @entity107 classic " @entity108 , " but makes it clear that she wo n't venture into bold , operatic vocal territory			0
" i stay in my lane when it comes to that sort of thing , " she quipped			0
" i do n't think i can climb inside of that genre with the authenticity because it 's not a part of my musical dna			1
" one new area she is seemingly inclined to is social media			0
@entity23 recently launched her own @entity124 account ( @ reallycassandra ) where she informs her thousands of followers about her latest whereabouts and publicly muses with fellow jazz musicians like @entity128			0
" i absolutely love it because it breaks down the barriers between the artists and the audiences , " @entity23 said			0
" it really brings you close to the people who come to sit down in the clubs			0
and that 's a good thing			2
it makes us more easily accessible			0
it makes understanding of your art and your life more accessible to your audience			0
" but do n't expect all access to the singer , she said			0
" i am very private when it comes to my private life , but the music is for everyone			0
i do believe the audience have a right to the public @entity1 , so i tweet away			1
" she also uses @entity124 as a platform to help promote other causes and artists from her hometown of @entity12 -- such as her new discovery , a new singer / songwriter named @entity163 ' , whom she describes as a " powerhouse			0
" the recently opened live - music venue , @entity167 : a music room , in @entity12 , converted from a photography studio , has become a showplace for such talent			0
and @entity23 is the owner			0
" it feels good because we 're in the process of mentoring and helping other artists in @entity13 to hone their craft and get out there in the marketplace , " she said			0
@entity23 is currently in @entity179 readying an eight - show stint at the famous @entity181 , where she has performed to sold - out audiences in for years			0
just there in the spring for a weeklong engagement , now she 's hosting her first album - release party with a string of concerts .			1

the new project is through her own record label , @entity41
