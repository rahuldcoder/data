@entity0 , @entity1 -- sipping a sweet lime juice on the rooftop bar of a designer hotel in @entity0 , @entity3 looks the epitome of a relaxed , confident young @entity9 entrepreneur			1
high hopes : @entity3 , left , and @entity11 set up thier marketing outsourcing company			0
but setting up his marketing outsourcing company just seven months ago was far from a relaxing experience			0
it 's a recent memory that still provokes a momentary look of discomfort			0
" it was just painful , " he says with a wry smile			0
it seems that despite the potential riches to be had by tapping in to all the talent , energy and potential in @entity1 , going it alone is still a unique experience in the country , even for those who are used to working there			2
multinational companies may be finding their path into the world of @entity9 business smooth , but that official approach has n't trickled down to @entity1 's burgeoning business brains with billionaire aspirations			1
" if you 're a large company trying to set up a subsidiary and you want to set up in @entity1 , a lot of that bureaucracy has gone away , but not for an entrepreneur , " says @entity3 who previously worked for @entity39			1
from getting a bank account to securing a line of credit , the same rigid attitude from officialdom remains with decisions made at a glacial place			0
" the government ministry has not been so fast to change			0
it 's become easier , but still a lot of that thinking has not gone away , " he said			2
@entity3 and his brother @entity56 even had trouble registering the name of their company , @entity59			0
" we called the company @entity59 , which stands for chief marketing officer , but for a long time could n't get the name approved by the registrar of companies here , because they said @entity63 means chief minister 's @entity68			2
so we had a really tough time , just convincing people			0
" but for the 36 - year - old @entity3 seeing the bigger picture and potential of his company was worth of all the aggravation			0
an october 2007 report into the marketing sector by @entity78 put its value at around $ 8 billion			0
a year on , the potential value might still be there , but tapping in to it during an economic downturn as investors and companies return to " studying the market " will be the big challenge			0
" despite so many global funds being in @entity1 it 's still very difficult for a start - up to get funding			1
" it certainly is for first time entrepreneurs , as @entity3 suggests that those with a family history in business or politics where it 's easier to secure backing find things much easier			1
" in @entity102 first generation entrepreneur successes are still there but you can count them on the fingers of one hand			0
" the understanding just is n't there in a part of @entity1 that is more used to the garment industry and traditional forms of business , " says @entity11 , @entity3 's brother and business partner			1
different industries , same problems 700 miles ( 1,127 kilometers ) away in @entity117 , @entity116 is busy with his fledgling animation company @entity118			2
after 13 years working abroad he returned to @entity1 to find the same frustrations as the @entity120 in setting up the business			1
" if you are going to do business in @entity1 , there is a lot of red tape and corruption			1
you have to learn to deal with , but it is very frustrating			0
if you 're caught up in some regulation and the laws are kind of ambiguous and there 's no right or wrong the authorities can give you a lot of trouble , " he said			0
if you ca n't deal with it , then you 're doing business in the wrong country			0
it is stupid , but part and parcel of being in @entity1			1
" @entity116 brought much of @entity145 's business contacts with him , doing post-production graphics on films such as " @entity148 " @entity150 's " @entity149 " and big budget @entity152 flicks , much of the hard work comes in maintaining quality			1
" getting the job is the easier part ; it 's delivering it to the quality that 's expected and with the service levels that expected that the harder part			1
we work on that day in and day out , " he said			0
having worked abroad he has an acute understanding of the differences between various work cultures and attitudes and the thought of working for a graphics company in @entity1 was almost unthinkable			1
" there was no lack of talent in terms of the animators , but the way in which the animation studios were managed was lacking			0
" i found it disheartening that the people who were managing these companies only cared about the hardware and how much money was pumped into the software , forgetting that it 's about people			2
i would have gone crazy working for people like that , especially having worked abroad , " he said at @entity188 employees have a five - day week and something closer to a 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. working day , compared to the more typical @entity9 routine of working 6 days a week , starting at 1pm and working until around midnight			0
with a more western work culture at @entity188 , @entity116 's company is still in the minority , although @entity117 has become something of a creative design hub attracting similar companies with like - minded attitudes , thanks to it 's proximity to @entity200 , but better quality of life , and the high quality of its universities and training colleges			1
changing attitudes facing rigid attitudes from clients has been a challenge for both @entity116 and the @entity120 , but there is the potentially bigger task of changing attitudes closer to home			1
" the mindset has changed in @entity1 , thanks to the growth in the it sector here and rise in entrepreneurs			2
until this happened , doing business was not thought of as a very hot thing to do -- in traditional families in @entity1 , if you 're doing business then there 's something wrong with you , " said @entity3			1
@entity3 and @entity56 were both born and raised in @entity0 and the desire to blaze their own trail and be part of the positive changes to business and society in their hometown was one of their motivating forces			2
for @entity116 the pains , pitfall but pleasures of setting up shop in @entity1 are all worth the effort : " for me it was challenge			1
i wanted to be in @entity1 and to do the kind of high end film graphics that you would have thought could n't be done in @entity1 with @entity9 talent that had n't been as trained			2
to do it you have to be a bit of a sadist , but that 's part of the charm of @entity1			1

entrepreneurs and start - ups still face maddening tangle of bureaucracy
@entity1 has become an easier place for *foreign* firms to work and set up business
officials and cultural attitudes are some of biggest *battles* new companies face
@entity116 : " you have to be a bit of a sadist , but that 's part of the charm of @entity1 . "
