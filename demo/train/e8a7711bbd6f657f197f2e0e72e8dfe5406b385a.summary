@entity1 , @entity0 -- the international race among sailors , kite surfers and wind surfers to be the fastest wind - powered boat on the planet is rapidly gaining momentum as speeds reach all - time highs			0
@entity13 sailor : @entity15 trimaran @entity14 is one of the boats battling for the outright world sailing speed record			1
the outright world sailing speed record -- which did not change hands for 11 years after 1993 -- has been bettered four times this year alone			1
the new holder of the record , @entity23 , of @entity15 , claimed it with an average speed of 50.57 knots ( almost 60 miles per hour ) over 500 meters on his kite board off the coast of @entity29 last month			1
@entity31 ' attempt was eventually ratified by the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) this month , when it was decided that kite boards would be eligible for the outright record			1
meanwhile , another @entity15 , @entity35 , has also been closely challenging for the record on his vessel @entity14			2
@entity35 's crew hold the 500m speed record in the boat class , and also have the overall speed record in the one nautical mile category			1
then there is the @entity44 sailor hoping to spoil the party for the @entity15			2
@entity49 , aboard @entity48 yacht @entity46 , has unofficially nabbed the fastest boat record from @entity14 with an average speed of 47.4 knots			2

@entity35 held the record with a speed of 46.88 knots			0
even the round - the - world @entity61 has had a speed record of its own with current leader @entity65 4 claiming the world record for the most distance sailed in a 24 - hour period during the event 's first leg			1
according to a spokesman from the @entity32 , interest in speed sailing is steadily building , and the close competition has been giving it a boost			1
" certainly towards the end of the year it 's been very hectic			0
i think what has happened is that a number of competitors have been at the top end and they have all been competing against each other at the same venues			0
the development of new technologies is one factor that has increased interest in trying to break these records			0
" the fact that kite boards have developed has helped ... but there is still a lot of people out there that want to achieve these records , " the spokesman said			0
he said that a lot of syndicates had been involved in speed sailing for some time , and that many were only now starting to feel the benefits of their developmental work			0
" it does seem if you are going for a specially designed boat it takes a few years before you get the design right , " he said			0
the spokesman said the @entity32 had received about 50 formal applications for speed attempts during 2008			1
he said the council 's job was not to promote the attempts but simply to oversee them in a fair and independent manner and ratify successful efforts			0
the @entity32 had a number of commissioners based around the world , he said .			2
