-- for the past week , @entity1 brought his presidential campaign abroad to @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 , leaving his initial footprint on the foreign policy landscape			1
he may have ventured off path once or twice , but , to paraphrase @entity9 , not all those who travel are lost			0
he blazed his own trail , one that will do him much good at home and abroad			1
before he even left for @entity14 , liberal commentators , on both sides of the @entity17 , jumped all over his alleged gaffe on @entity20 's readiness for the @entity21			0
@entity1 was asked a question by @entity23 , which he answered like a technocrat , an expert , and one of the few men in the world who has run an @entity21			1
as @entity35 so wisely noted , " he did what a man who prizes his authority on a subject does -- he answered			0
it was a serious subject -- his subject			0
" if he 's to be blamed for anything , it 's speaking too much like an expert and not a politician			0
critics of @entity1 often patronize him for sounding too scripted and too much like a politician			1
now , when he speaks openly and freely , they criticize him for not being enough of a politician or diplomat			0
they ca n't have it both ways			0
from @entity3 he traveled to @entity4 , where he strongly backed prime minister @entity48 and the @entity4 people and subtly distanced himself from president @entity50 by vocalizing bolder action against @entity52			1
" we must not delude ourselves into thinking that containment is an option , " @entity1 said			1
" we must lead the effort to prevent @entity52 from building and possessing nuclear weapons capability			1
we should employ any and all measures to dissuade the @entity52 regime from its nuclear course			2
" opinion : @entity1 on @entity52 is just like @entity50 but rather than focus on @entity52 , our most pressing foreign policy dilemma , the liberal media manufactured another alleged gaffe -- @entity1 's comments on the cultural differences between @entity4 and @entity68			1
again , much ado about nothing			0
it 's hard to dispute the powerful and rich culture of the @entity74 people , especially when quoting " @entity77 " by @entity75 , an erudite @entity76 professor			2
to his credit , @entity1 did n't let this slow him down			2
he concluded the trip by traveling to @entity5 for a full embrace of @entity82 and the @entity5 people , a strong contrast to the cold shoulder @entity50 gave to @entity5 earlier in his presidency			1
in 2008 , despite direct threats from @entity88 , @entity5 agreed to accept @entity90 missile defense sites			2
in 2009 , @entity50 folded to @entity88 criticism and abandoned the missile system , in turn abandoning the @entity5 people			1
in a not so subtle jab to the president , @entity1 declared in @entity5 , " i believe it is critical to stand by those who have stood by @entity90			1
@entity99 was a great movement that freed a nation			0
and it is with solidarity that @entity90 and @entity5 face the future			2
" @entity1 's closeness to @entity82 and the @entity5 freedom fighters is nothing short of @entity108			1
at a time when the president tries desperately to compare him to @entity111 , @entity1 is making @entity50 look and feel more like @entity112			2
opinion : when did the @entity114 become the whiners ? to those who doubt @entity1 's political adroitness , examine his deep respect for @entity119 both in @entity5 and here in the @entity90			1
speaking of the @entity121 , @entity1 added , " the false gods of the all - powerful state claim the allegiance of a lonely few			2
it is for us , in this generation and beyond , to show all the world what free people and free economies can achieve for the good of all			0
" given that the controversial @entity135 ' contraception mandate , viewed by many @entity136 as a direct threat to their religious conscience , went into effect august 1 for all employers , other than churches and houses of worship ( religiously affiliated institutions such as @entity119 hospitals and universities have a one - year exemption before they must comply ) , this statement is timely and bold			2
@entity1 also embraced pope @entity148 , a @entity5 and @entity119 hero , one of the men most responsible for the fall of @entity151			1
" and here , in 1979 , a son of @entity5 , pope @entity148 , spoke words that would bring down an empire and bring freedom to millions who lived in bondage			0
' be not afraid ' -- those words changed the world , " @entity1 said			0
the contrast could not be clearer -- " be not afraid " or " you did n't build that " -- one man 's vision of hope , resolution and encouragement versus condescension , apathy and inertness			0
if this is the electoral choice @entity1 can frame for the nation , he will be one step closer to the @entity174			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

@entity179 : in his trip to @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 , @entity1 blazed his own trail
in @entity4 , he *forcefully* sought bolder action against @entity52 , @entity177 says
@entity177 : in @entity5 , @entity1 offered a full embrace of @entity82 and the @entity5 people
if you doubt @entity1 's political adroitness , note his respect for @entity119 , @entity177 says
