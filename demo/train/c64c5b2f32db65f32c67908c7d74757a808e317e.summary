@entity0 , @entity1 -- former @entity4 president @entity3 and his wife , @entity5 , landed in @entity0 on monday for a private visit aimed at reducing tension between the @entity9 enemies and seeing first - hand the economic reforms sweeping the communist island			1
but expectations are high that @entity3 also will work behind the scenes to secure the release of @entity4 contractor @entity15 , who was recently sentenced to 15 years in a @entity1 prison			1
unlike his first visit in 2002 , when then - president @entity20 personally greeted @entity3 on the tarmac , this time foreign minister @entity18 was on hand to receive the former @entity4 leader			1
the @entity24 has called the three - day trip a non-governmental mission at the invitation of the @entity1 government			2
on monday afternoon , he met with @entity31 leaders and the archbishop of @entity0 , cardinal @entity32			1
@entity3 declined to comment monday when reporters asked him about @entity15 , shouting , " there will be a press conference later			1
" a press conference is scheduled for wednesday			0
@entity1 accuses the @entity38 of " subversive " work connecting people to the internet illegally , with the ultimate goal of undermining the government			0
@entity44 says he was simply helping the jewish community connect to the worldwide web and has repeatedly said that bilateral relations can not improve until @entity15 is released			0
@entity3 visited the @entity31 center and @entity50			1
when @entity52 , the president of the temple , was asked if they discussed @entity15 , she said : " we did n't talk about politics			0
we told him about the @entity31 community in @entity1 , how many members it has , how we openly practice our religion , etc. " secretary of state @entity62 met with @entity3 before his departure to discuss the issue , according to @entity65 , a spokeswoman for the @entity66 in @entity0			1
" we hope president @entity3 will urge the @entity1 government to immediately release mr. gross on humanitarian grounds , " she told @entity2			2
on tuesday , @entity3 will have a face - to - face session with president @entity72			2
in many ways , the time is ripe			0
@entity20 has launched a major shakeup of the nation 's @entity77 - style economic model , paving the way for more small businesses and private enterprise			0
and just last week , @entity1 released the last of 75 dissidents jailed in a 2003 crackdown on the opposition that prompted worldwide condemnation			0
so at least in theory , two of the major obstacles to bilateral negotiations have been lifted .			0

new : @entity3 visits a @entity31 center and temple and meets with the archbishop of @entity0
the trip is *officially* to *strengthen* bilateral ties
however , there are hopes the *ex-president* may try to *lobby* for an @entity4 prisoner
the @entity4 contractor was recently sentenced to 15 years in prison
