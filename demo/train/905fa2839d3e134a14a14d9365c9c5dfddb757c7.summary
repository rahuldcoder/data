@entity1 , @entity2 @entity0 argued on wednesday that @entity4 need to spend more time targeting nontraditional @entity4 voters during presidential primaries , saying the party 's messaging gap is greatest with minority voters			1
" during our campaigns for the primary vote , we tend to go to the audiences that vote in a @entity4 primary and tend therefore not to be as involved in minority communities as we need to be to win the general election , " the 2012 @entity4 presidential nominee told an audience at @entity12			2
" and so we got to stop thinking so much about the primary and start thinking more about making sure we have people that support us in the general election , " he continued			0
he followed up saying he was n't urging republicans to spend less time thinking about the primary but to devote equal amount of attention to " all audiences			0
" @entity0 , who 's considering yet another presidential bid , made no mention of where he is in his thought process about a third campaign , but said he felt confident that " the great days of @entity33 have not ended ; they 're ahead with the right kind of leadership			1
" combating poverty in his speech , @entity0 hit on familiar refrains about nostalgia from his campaign as well as challenges facing the country			1
he also wove in swipes against @entity45 , who 's widely considered the @entity48 frontrunner if she runs for president			0
if @entity0 runs again , he 's likely to make anti-poverty policy a key part of his message			1
@entity0 said the war on poverty that started under president @entity56 " came from a good heart " but argued " the policies were n't as good as the heart			2
" to address the problem , @entity0 argued that the government should not create incentives for people to avoid marriage , saying a single mother on @entity65 or other assistance may not want to get married because she could lose her benefits			1
" if marriage ... is essential to helping people to stay out of poverty , then we want to do the opposite , " he said			2
" we want to create incentives for them to get married , not to not get married			0
" he also said k - 12 education needs to improve , and he encouraged creating incentives for people to hire workers who have n't worked before , but did n't outline specifics			0
@entity45 @entity0 is also looking straight past his potential @entity4 rivals and sharpening his attacks against @entity81			1
he argued that the former secretary of state was " clueless " on relations with @entity86 and would prove inept on economic policy if elected president			0
" how can secretary @entity45 provide opportunity for all if she does n't know where jobs come from in the first place ? " @entity0 said			2
he also argued that @entity45 helped contribute to @entity93 's " timid " approach to foreign policy			0
" secretary of state @entity81 cluelessly pressed a reset button for @entity86 , which smiled and then invaded @entity96 , a sovereign nation , " @entity0 said			1
related : @entity81 stands by ' @entity86 reset ' in face of recent events as @entity0 was headed to @entity2 , the nation 's poorest state , his political team fought back against perceptions that his wealth could be a political liability if he runs for president again , arguing that @entity45 is no model for modest living , either			1
" it 's going to be hard for @entity81 to make @entity0 's wealth a fruitful line of attack , with her multi-million dollar mansions in @entity115 and @entity116 and her jet - setting lifestyle of the rich and famous , " a @entity0 aide said wednesday			1
that comment was also included in a new report by the @entity120 that details how @entity0 purchased or built two new homes after his 2012 election loss			2
the former private equity ceo , whose wealth became an overriding theme for @entity48 attacks , has a total of four homes : a mansion in @entity130 , @entity131 ; a ski chalet in @entity133 , @entity134 ; a large home in @entity136 ; and a house on @entity138 , @entity139			0
the home in @entity130 , complete with a car elevator , has been undergoing renovations to make it bigger since 2012 , and according the @entity120 , is now being shown to potential buys by a broker			0
correct the @entity148 , the pro-clinton communications and research pac , pushed back against @entity0 's response wednesday			1
" while @entity0 tries in vain to reinvent himself as a friend to those who are struggling , @entity81 is continuing her life - long work to lift up the middle class and level the playing field for all @entity33 , " said @entity150 , communications director for the group , said in an email to @entity3			1
related : @entity160 's invisible man strategy @entity0 was constantly playing defense against multi-million dollar @entity48 campaigns that pilloried his corporate background and painted him as out of touch			2
he also sought to overcome a string of gaffes ― i.e. " i like being able to fire people " and " i have some great friends who are @entity170 team owners " ― that @entity48 quickly used as fuel for their fire against the then - @entity4 nominee			0
a spokesman for @entity45 did not immediately return a request for comment			0
the former secretary of state , widely seen as the @entity48 frontrunner if she runs for president , has fought her own battle against accusations of being out of touch , in part because of her six - figure speaking fees and because of comments she made last summer in which she argued that her family was " dead broke " after leaving the @entity187			0
@entity0 's $ 50,000 honorarium ( minus travel costs ) is being donated to @entity190 , a restorative eyesight organization based in @entity192 , @entity134			1
@entity193 contributed to this report .			0

@entity0 focused on how to address poverty , minority *outreach* as he considers another presidential bid
he stressed that the government should encourage people to get married as a way to combat poverty
as *renewed* attention *surfaces* on his wealth , @entity0 's team points to another wealthy potential candidate , @entity81
