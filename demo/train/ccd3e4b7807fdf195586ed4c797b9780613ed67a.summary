@entity0 -- as president @entity3 marks his 100th day in office , most recent national polls indicate that more than six in 10 @entity5 approve of the job he 's doing as president			1
polls reflect that most @entity5 approve of president @entity3 's performance during his first 100 days in office			1
according to a @entity1 poll of polls compiled wednesday , 63 percent said they approve of how @entity3 is handling his duties			1
twenty - nine percent disapprove			0
the rating is down 3 percentage points from @entity1 's previous poll of polls , which was compiled sunday			2
the president 's approval rating stood at 64 percent in a @entity1 poll of polls in january shortly after his inauguration			1
" the number of @entity5 who think @entity3 has the right personal qualities to be president has gone up since the campaign last fall , " said @entity23 , @entity1 's polling director			2
" that was n't true for @entity30 eight years ago , and it may be one reason why @entity3 's approval rating is still in the 60s			1
" how does @entity3 compare with his predecessors around the first 100 - days mark ? @entity30 stood at 62 percent in a @entity1 / @entity36 / @entity37 in april 2001 ; @entity38 at 55 percent in a @entity1 / @entity36 / @entity37 in april 1993 ; @entity39 at 58 percent in a @entity37 from april 1989 ; and @entity40 at 67 percent in a @entity37 in april 1981			0
" the 100 - day mark tends to fall during a period when @entity5 are still evaluating a new president			0
the danger period for most presidents comes later in their first year in office , " @entity23 said			0
" @entity38 , for example , still had good marks after his first 100 days , but his approval rating had tanked by june of 1993			0
@entity40 's approval rating stayed over 50 percent until november of his first year in office , but once it slipped below that mark , it stayed under 50 percent for two years			2
so @entity3 's current rating certainly does not indicate that he is out of the woods yet			0
" the most recent edition of the @entity1 poll of polls is an average of seven national surveys taken over the past week : @entity1 / @entity67 ( april 23 - 26 ) , @entity66 / @entity65 ( april 21 - 24 ) , @entity64 ( april 22 - 23 ) , @entity63 / the @entity60 ( april 22 - 26 ) , @entity61 ( april 21 - 23 ) , @entity62 ( april 21 - 27 ) and the @entity37 tracking poll ( april 25 - 27 )			1
