-- the chief justice of the @entity3 @entity2 ruled tuesday in favor of an @entity6 father in an international custody battle			1
the ruling by chief justice @entity9 will reunite a 9 - year - old boy with his father , @entity11 , who has been locked in a custody battle with the family of the boy 's deceased mother			1
last week , a lower court unanimously upheld a decision ordering that @entity11 be returned to his father in @entity19			1
@entity11 arrived in @entity20 to reunite with his son , but one @entity2 justice issued a stay , ordering @entity11 to remain with his @entity3 relatives until the high court could consider the case			1
@entity28 ' decision lifted the stay , paving the way for @entity31 to be reunited with his son			0
@entity11 's grandmother , @entity32 , was expected to immediately file appeals to tuesday 's ruling			1
in a letter to @entity3 president @entity36 , @entity32 said that the legal process was overlooking the boy 's own desires			1
" i feel threatened by losing my grandson @entity11 because of international pressures that do n't consider the interest of a 9 - year - old child who passionately desires to remain among those that gave him comfort in the mother 's death , " the letter states in part			1
" they allege that the @entity51 determined to hand him over immediately			0
i am not a lawyer			0
but what i know is that the @entity51 establishes as priority the interest of the child , and the child was n't heard			0
" the custody battle began in 2004 , when @entity11 's wife , @entity11 , took their then - 4 - year - old son from their home in @entity19 to @entity20 for what was to have been a two - week vacation			1
she never returned , instead remarrying there and retaining custody of @entity11			2
she died last year in childbirth			2
@entity31 has argued that as the sole surviving parent , he should be granted custody			0
the @entity32 family argues it would traumatize @entity11 to remove him from what has been his home for five years			2
the custody battle garnered much media attention and spilled over into the political arena as well			0
@entity6 sen. @entity80 , @entity81 , had placed a hold on a trade bill that would have benefited @entity3 to the tune of $ 2.75 billion , but he lifted it on the court 's ruling , spokesman @entity79 said			1
the bill in question , which sailed through the @entity89 after the senator dropped the hold , would provide export tariff relief to 130 countries , of which @entity3 would be the fifth largest recipient , @entity79 said			2
@entity80 's hold was designed to exert additional pressure on @entity3 authorities to abide by the court order to return @entity11 to his father , he said			1
while the chief justice was still studying the case , @entity3 attorney general @entity99 said the executive branch sides with @entity31			0
" once we stop cooperating and start breaking our treaties and international obligations , @entity3 risks the chance of not having its own requests in the matters regarding international judicial help granted , based on the principle of international reciprocity , " @entity99 said monday			0
" not releasing the minor into the custody of his father could bring sanctions against @entity3 , " he added			0
" it could damage @entity3 's image before the international community			2
" @entity0 's @entity119 and @entity120 contributed to this report .			0
