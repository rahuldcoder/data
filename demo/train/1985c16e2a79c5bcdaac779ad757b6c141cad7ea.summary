@entity0 -- the @entity3 - controlled @entity2 delivered a mixed message on @entity6 's role in the @entity9 - led @entity8 campaign friday , opposing a resolution expressing support for the war while also voting down a bill restricting @entity6 involvement in the conflict			1
the first measure -- similar to legislation introduced in the @entity18 by sen. @entity19 , @entity20 , and sen. @entity21 , @entity22 -- was backed by the @entity23			2
it was defeated 123 - 295 , with republicans overwhelmingly opposing the measure and @entity26 voting more narrowly in favor of it			2
the second measure was strongly supported by @entity2 speaker @entity30 , @entity31 , and other top @entity3 leaders			1
it was defeated 180 - 238 , with @entity26 largely voting no as @entity3 voted yes by a slimmer margin			0
in short , the @entity2 appeared unable to speak with clarity on president @entity38 's controversial effort to oust @entity8 leader @entity39			1
@entity23 press secretary @entity40 expressed disappointment in the first @entity2 vote , and told reporters the " writing is on the wall " for @entity39			1
" now is not the time to let up , " he said			0
secretary of state @entity47 said she was " gratified that the @entity2 has decisively rejected efforts to limit funding for the @entity9 mission			1
" " i am pleased that a very important statement was made today by the @entity2 , on a bipartisan basis , that recognizes the need for us to continue this important mission , " she added			1
asked to explain the relatively rare defeat for the @entity2 leadership on the second vote , @entity30 only offered a one - word reply : " nothing			2
" a @entity3 leadership aide , however , told @entity1 there was last - minute concern among some @entity3 members that a vote to restrict certain forms of @entity6 involvement in the @entity9 mission could have been interpreted as an inherent authorization of other types of force			1
" once you de-facto ( approve ) it ... then the president can run with it , " said rep. @entity72 , @entity73 , who opposed both measures			0
" what we 're trying to do here is have our cake and eat it too			0
we 're trying to split it in half by declaring a partial war and then telling ( @entity38 ) how he is going to be commander - in - chief			0
" " i do n't think you can do that in a bill , " @entity72 said			2
" the proper resolution would say we should not be over there , ( and ) we are withholding all funds for all military activity , period			2
" rep. @entity93 , @entity94 , who backed the support resolution while opposing the bill restricting involvement , said he was n't lobbied by the @entity23 until friday morning			1
" i think moving forward , a lesson ( about administration outreach ) has been learned here , " he said			0
much of the @entity2 's disapproval of the @entity8 campaign has been fueled by a belief that @entity38 failed to sufficiently consult with @entity103 before committing to military engagement			1
specifically , representatives from both political parties say the administration has violated the 1973 @entity108 , which gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending @entity6 forces to war , followed by a 30 - day extension to end hostilities			1
the combined 90 - day period ended last sunday			0
support for the war has also been further shaken by evidence of several noncombatant deaths caused by recent @entity9 airstrikes			0
the @entity23 says @entity38 did n't need congressional authorization because @entity6 forces are playing only a supporting role in @entity8 and have n't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities			1
the president , however , personally overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the @entity127 and the @entity129 's @entity128 , according to a report published saturday in the @entity131			0
@entity30 said during friday 's debate on the @entity2 floor that @entity38 's authority under the @entity138 " does not free the president from accountability to the @entity6 people , this @entity103 or the rule of law			1
" the @entity108 " is the law of the land and simply can not be ignored , " he said			2
the @entity3 - sponsored bill is necessary to " defend the constitutional authority of the legislature " and provides " much - needed accountability			0
" some @entity26 , however , blasted @entity3 , accusing them of playing politics with what they called a critical foreign policy priority			0
" this was not handled right " by the @entity23 , said rep. @entity149 , @entity150			0
but the @entity2 votes are " nothing but politics , " and " i do n't want to abandon my friends in the @entity157 states who are now struggling for democracy			1
" defense secretary @entity160 said thursday it would be a mistake for @entity103 to cut funding for @entity6 military operations in @entity8			1
" i think , once we have our forces engaged , to deny them funding would be a mistake , " @entity160 told @entity165			2
key @entity6 allies -- especially the @entity172 , the @entity173 and the @entity174 -- consider @entity8 a vital interest , and " our alliance with them is a vital interest for us , " he said , citing their efforts in @entity180			1
@entity160 insisted that progress has been made toward the @entity6 goal of ousting @entity39			2
" based on everything we see , the government gets shakier by the day , " @entity160 said			0
" his forces have been significantly diminished			0
the opposition is expanding the areas under their control			0
" @entity190 met privately with @entity2 @entity26 on thursday to urge support for the resolution backing the @entity8 mission , according to a @entity26 source who attended the meeting			1
" the bottom line is , whose side are you on ? " she said earlier in the week			0
" are you on @entity39 's side , or are you on the side of the aspirations of the @entity8 people and the international coalition that has been created to support them ? " the allied military effort , which has formal @entity208 support , was launched to protect @entity8 civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by @entity39			1
@entity213 leaders have made clear , however , that they believe the mission can not be successfully completed without @entity39 's ouster			0
the @entity23 has promised not to use @entity6 ground troops , but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has nevertheless been mounting over several weeks			2
in addition to concerns about the @entity108 , traditional anti-war @entity26 and fiscally conservative @entity3 are worried about the cost of the conflict			2
in a recent report on the mission , the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through june 3 was about $ 800 million			1
it estimated the total cost through september 30 would be $ 1.1 billion			0
@entity1 's @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 contributed to this report .			0
