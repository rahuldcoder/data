the descendants noted that both inmates and guards suffered late in the war			0
" they shared a deplorable condition , " said @entity13			2

" @entity1 , 36 , said the chance meeting amplified what an archaeological excavation is really about -- understanding the lives and circumstances of the people who left personal belongings behind			1

so far , @entity1 said , the students are unearthing many artifacts in clusters , indicating they may have been left in tents or shelters			1
the discovery at @entity18 is expected to boost tourism in economically struggling @entity149 as well as awareness of the anthropology program at @entity32 , about a half hour south in @entity33			2
