-- @entity2 taxpayers have forked over around half a trillion dollars to @entity2 intelligence services since the 9/11 attacks , yet nearly a decade after @entity7 assaults on @entity8 and @entity9 , the @entity2 intelligence community still can not answer the most basic of questions : where is @entity13 ? where is his top deputy , @entity15 ? and where is @entity18 leader @entity17 ? as reported by @entity0 on monday , @entity20 officials believe @entity7 's leaders are hiding somewhere in northwestern @entity22 , while @entity17 is thought to orbit between @entity24 in western @entity22 and the southern port city of @entity26			1
as @entity22 is roughly twice as large as @entity27 and @entity26 is a city of 18 million , these are not particularly precise locations for the world 's most wanted men			0
if the @entity33 and other @entity2 intelligence agencies were private companies and were chronically unable to accomplish one of their key missions , their shareholders would have long ago revolted , fired their management and their stock would be trading at values near zero			1
instead , the budgets for the @entity2 intelligence agencies continue to spiral upward , while almost a million @entity2 possess top - secret clearances			1
what does a top - secret clearance gain you ? not much , judging by the content of the tens of thousands of secret documents about the @entity48 made public by @entity49 in july			0
the one surprising thing about this massive classified data dump was how little of it was in any way surprising			0
it contained the kind of material that the casual reader of news articles have long known : elements of @entity22 's military intelligence service may be supporting the @entity18 ! the dirty little secret of the intelligence world is that much of what you really need to know is n't exactly a secret anyway			2
@entity13 declared war on the @entity2 on @entity0 in 1997 and then again on @entity67 a year later , and he soon made good on those threats with @entity7 's attacks on two @entity2 embassies in @entity71 and the bombing of the @entity73 in @entity74			1
in the summer of 2001 , @entity13 and his top commanders gave an interview to the @entity77 , in which they dropped broad hints that they were planning a large - scale , anti-american assault , which turned out to be the 9/11 attacks			2
when president @entity84 was briefed by the @entity33 a month before 9/11 that @entity13 intended to attack the @entity2 , it was merely to state the blindingly obvious			1
similarly today , @entity7 and allied groups such as the @entity18 constantly release videotapes and print products in which they lay out their doctrines and strategies and document their attacks and tactics , all of which are widely available on the @entity94			2
the conflict with @entity7 and its allies is effectively the first open - source war , which is the opposite of how the highly secretive @entity98 conducted the @entity99			2
yet @entity2 intelligence agencies remain largely configured as if they are doing battle with a superpower , rather than a network of jihadist networks			1
as a result , the @entity33 today more resembles an accounting firm than the swashbuckling , action - oriented spy agency of popular imagination			2
this is not an accident			0
hiring by the @entity33 and other agencies in the intelligence community is predicated on passing a background check that has become more onerous since 9/11 and is a legacy of the @entity99 notion that a superpower adversary with billions of dollars at its disposal is trying to recruit spies and informants			1
but @entity7 has no capacity to buy spies inside @entity2 's intelligence community , and , more broadly , @entity7 and its allies have shown no ability to recruit inside the @entity2 government			1
yet applicants to the @entity2 intelligence agencies today are likely to encounter real problems with their background checks if they have relatives in the @entity133 world or have spent time in countries such as @entity22 , precisely the sort of life experiences necessary for effective spies			1
by contrast , the @entity139 , the precursor of the @entity33 , recruited bilingual agents deeply familiar with @entity144 culture who took great risks to undertake highly effective operations in @entity148 - occupied @entity144			2
in today 's @entity33 , those brave men and women would n't have made it past the background check			2
much of the work that has been done to reform the intelligence community since 9/11 has been directed at fussing with the wiring diagram of its bureaucracy : should the director of @entity159 control @entity33 station chiefs , or is that the purview of the @entity33 director ? this kind of jockeying , of course , does nothing to solve the real question @entity2 taxpayers want answered : where is @entity13 ? that question is likely only to be resolved by good old - fashioned espionage			1
emblematic of what ails the intelligence community today was its reaction to the failed attempt by @entity176 ( @entity176 ) to blow up a @entity178 passenger jet landing in @entity179 , @entity180 , with a bomb made of plastic explosives on christmas day 2009			0
to do the job , @entity176 recruited in @entity74 a @entity185 graduate of the elite @entity186			0
there was a great deal of subsequent hand - wringing by @entity193 administration officials about how improved information sharing protocols might have worked better to assemble the shards of information known to the government about @entity188 , which might have prevented him from boarding the @entity178 flight			0
their solution : hire more analysts			0
but this was to misdiagnose the problem			0
the intelligence community is awash in analysts			0
while the precise number is classified , it is reasonable to assume that there are tens of thousands			0
what is needed is not more analysts but better on - the - ground intelligence			0
if the @entity33 had had a spy on the fringes of @entity176 , the appearance of an educated @entity185 from @entity216 in the remote desert areas of @entity74 where @entity7 members hide out would have been something that the spy would have flagged to his handlers as remarkable			1
there does not appear to have been such an agent			0
what can be done ? the @entity226 and @entity227 committees that oversee the intelligence community should hold the @entity33 to real account using a simple metric : how many jihadist groups including @entity7 have been penetrated by its agents ? this is less onerous a demand then one might imagine			1
after just a few months of hanging out in @entity22 , @entity235 , an unemployed hispanic - american convert to militant @entity236 from @entity237 , managed to waltz into an @entity7 training camp where he was trained how to attack @entity2 bases in @entity241			1
and that was seven years after 9/11			0
budgets should be cut if the @entity33 ca n't provide proof that it is penetrating @entity7 and its affiliates ; at the end of the day , this is the most likely way that we will ever find @entity13 , who is not going to be voluntarily given up by the few who know his location today			1
president @entity193 should appoint someone in the @entity2 government whose job it is to find @entity13 and who can coordinate that effort across the 16 agencies that make up the @entity2 intelligence community			1
finally , the background check for spies should be reformed so that men and women with the regional expertise and linguistic abilities to penetrate and recruit inside jihadist terrorist groups are hired to go outside the wire and get the job done			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity270 .			0

@entity2 spends billions on an *enormous* intelligence bureaucracy , says @entity270
he says nearly a decade after 9/11 , @entity2 ca n't locate @entity13
@entity2 intelligence agencies are n't positioned to infiltrate militant groups , he says
@entity270 : " budgets should be cut if the @entity33 ca n't provide proof that it is penetrating @entity7 "
