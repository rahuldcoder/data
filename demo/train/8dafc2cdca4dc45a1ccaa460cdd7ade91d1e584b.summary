@entity0 -- for visitors and newcomers , the mention of @entity0 conjures up images of the queen , gray skies , @entity8 and @entity9			1
but the opening of the @entity11 will confront millions around the world with unfamiliar scenes of @entity0 's @entity0 , the vibrant and distinctly proletarian heart of the capital			1
@entity0 has long housed the capital 's working , criminal and creative classes			1
and @entity19 , where the @entity20 now stands , has been regarded by many as little more than a post-industrial wasteland , a relic of the city 's bygone manufacturing era			0
when i moved to @entity0 from @entity27 in 2006 , i thought the @entity0 might look like the gilded west @entity0 settings i 'd seen during my first trip to the capital in 2001			2
but @entity31 , where i settled , one train stop from @entity19 , was no one 's destination of choice			0
nor was @entity19 -- unless , that is , you needed to buy flimsy housewares from the @entity40 discount store in the grim outlet mall flanking the train station			0

for those who have n't been , @entity50 is a sprawling expanse of scalding hot desert and cactus - lined asphalt in southwest @entity27			0
almost nothing has been around for more than a hundred years			0
@entity0 , on the other hand , has been lived in for thousands of years			0
an @entity0 bell foundry made the @entity58 , that famous icon of @entity61 independence , in the 1750s , before the @entity61 even became a country			0

while many west @entity0 neighborhoods have aged gracefully , large eastern swathes of the capital merely look dilapidated and rundown			2
fortunately , what the area lacked in towering monuments to @entity78 glory , it made up for in gruesome historical footnotes			0
forget @entity8 , the @entity80 and @entity81			0
@entity0 's top tourist attraction is the @entity84 tour -- a guide around the dark streets and alleys in @entity88 where an unidentified madman stalked , murdered and disemboweled prostitutes in 1888			1
not quite the same as a double - decker bus tour past @entity9			0
read more : @entity0 's @entity92 for someone who spent years piloting a car down @entity50 's broad , unclogged desert boulevards , taking a bus through the traffic - choked @entity0 was a more adventurous prospect -- and i developed a theory early on that the number 25 , cutting a path east from the @entity103 , @entity0 's default nightlife center , had to be @entity0 's worst route			1
i once saw a drunk man get his face split open during a fistfight aboard the 25 , a long , single - decker accordion - style monstrosity , the back section of which regularly turned into a smoking section for gangs and drunks and the only bus that ever made me truly miss my car			0
the only thing more surprising than the fight was that no one moved a muscle , or seemed to think it was unusual			0
rather than call the police , the driver simply opened the doors to let the man off , leaking blood across the floor as he limped away			0

it was outside this historic old boozer that @entity132 delivered his sermon that established the @entity134 -- and inside it that notorious @entity137 gangster @entity136 shot @entity138 through the forehead in 1966 in front of shocked drinkers			0
@entity0 has always been rough around the edges , but that 's what makes it interesting			2
waves of immigrants have settled amongst the white working - class locals in the @entity0 for generations -- @entity150 communities in @entity31 and @entity88 ; @entity153 - @entity152 communities in @entity154 ; and @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 communities in @entity159 -- and the area 's extreme diversity means that virtually anything you want is only a bus stop away			1
on a single morning at @entity166 market in @entity167 , you 'll pass designer clothes , donuts the size of your head , pirate dvds , and the stall whose chief product appears to be thermal socks ( my personal favorite ) , before nipping into east @entity0 institution @entity178 for the area 's signature dish : handmade beef pies , served with mashed potatoes drenched in parsley sauce			1

depending on how flush you are , you can enter your huckleberry finn ( pin ) and withdraw anything from a speckled hen ( Â £ 10 ) to a nifty ( Â £ 50 )			0
ten minutes down the road , along the south end of @entity199 , fabric shops sit alongside dozens of @entity202 curry houses ; at the north end , you can rummage through vintage clothing shops before tucking into a salt beef bagel at the world - famous @entity206 , a 24 - hour reminder of @entity210 migration to the area more than a century ago			0
a steady stream of educated , creative types have gentrified @entity214 and @entity159 in a generation , and the dozens of cafes , bars and nightclubs that sprouted up have turned the rundown road connecting the two neighborhoods into @entity0 's most fashionable destination for a night out			2
the smartening - up of these working - class neighborhoods -- with their cheap rent , relatively large spaces and newly opened train lines -- was inevitable in a way , but it has only added to , not dimmed , the cacophony of eclectic voices ringing through the streets			2
video : @entity63 spending to boost @entity0 economy gentrification is going on in unimaginable parts of east @entity0 today			1
in @entity154 -- voted @entity78 's worst place to live by @entity238 in 2006 -- a recently refurbished theatre and new boutique cinema flourish alongside the @entity242 restaurants dotting @entity243 , just hundreds of feet from an area previously known as @entity246 for a string of gangland killings which took place around 2000			1
but opening a series of glossy gastropubs and flower markets does n't change the fact that three of the five official @entity63 boroughs ( @entity154 , @entity256 and @entity257 ) are among @entity78 's poorest districts -- a fact which became painfully clear during last summer 's riots			1
the shooting in august 2011 of a young black man by police in north @entity0 set off days of the worst rioting across the capital in 30 years			2
the epicenter of the chaos in @entity154 was on @entity243 , where rioters set cars alight , battled police and took everything from shops they could carry			0
read more : four billion reasons to watch the @entity63 today , the riots stand as a reminder that the deep - seated poverty in many parts of east @entity0 ca n't be wiped out by a three - week international sporting event any more than it can be eradicated by a handful of college kids moving into the neighborhood			1
last summer 's riots showed the worst @entity0 is capable of			2
but what happened the day after , when hundreds of volunteers turned up with brooms to help clean up east @entity0 's broken neighborhoods , showed an extraordinary sense of community that might have surprised some people in the capital			1
no one 's sure yet what the @entity63 will mean for the @entity0			1
roughly Â £ 9.3 billion ( $ 14.5 billion ) of the public 's money has been spent on the @entity296 , three - quarters of which has reportedly been invested in long - term regeneration			1
but while the @entity300 is visible from much of east @entity0 , how many people there will actually see tangible benefits from the @entity296 ? regardless of its future legacy , the @entity63 are here now , and east @entity0 has much to be proud of			1
as for whether the @entity296 can mark a turning point in the fortunes of some of @entity78 's poorest areas , the verdict on that wo n't be returned until long after the athletes have gone and the world 's eyes have again turned away			1

@entity0 has long been home to the capital 's working , creative and criminal classes
the @entity0 is one of @entity78 's most *ethnically* diverse -- and poor -- areas
many doubt the @entity63 will bring long - term benefits to east @entity0
