-- as this election season unfolds , we are watching an age - old dream in politics go horribly smash			0
it is n't good for politics , and it sure is n't good for the country			0
president @entity9 helped to fire up the dream during his second term in office			1
coming off a massive landslide in 1936 , he believed that it would be far better for governing if the @entity15 became the liberal party and @entity17 the conservative one			1
in the 1938 congressional elections , he barnstormed across the @entity20 trying to purge the @entity21 of several incumbent conservatives			1
his efforts backfired -- the incumbents won and were sore at @entity9 -- but the dream became a staple of politics			1
in 1950 , for example , in one of the landmark studies in political science -- one still read today by undergraduate majors -- some of the best minds of the day argued strongly that the nation would benefit from more ideologically " coherent " parties : that things would be better if @entity15 stood firmly for a liberal ideology and @entity17 for a conservative one			1
that way , people would have clear choices , they would know what they were voting for , and they could count on their party delivering if it were in power			1
" shoo out those racially suspect @entity48 conservatives from @entity21 ranks and those lily - livered @entity51 liberals from the @entity17			1
and maybe some of those moderates , too			0
" so the thinking went			0
well , in recent years , we have seen the dream come true			0
and guess what ? it is producing a mess			0
as each of the parties has moved toward ideological purity , our politics have become ever more polarized , our governing ever more paralyzed			1
extremists increasingly run the show			0
this campaign season is pointing toward a rough road ahead after the november elections			0
yes , it is true that in selecting a presidential candidate , both parties have chosen men who on the surface seem moderate centrists			2
but each of the candidates has decided that in order to win , he must first stir up his ideological base			1
would @entity79 have endorsed the @entity81 budget , a hard line against immigration and a condemnation of @entity85 if he were not trying to prove that he 's a " severe conservative " ? meanwhile , @entity87 has moved left , pushing taxes on the rich , piling up trillion - dollar deficits and bashing the same @entity17 he would have to work with in a second term			1
one can see these trends in harsher relief amid campaigns for the @entity95 and @entity96			0
@entity97 , a moderate and much - beloved @entity17 senator from @entity98 facing her first primary challenge , is retiring because of a lack of bipartisanship and mechanisms to find " common ground			1
" sens. @entity105 and @entity106 -- both stalwarts of the @entity17 who have committed apostasy by trying to work across party lines -- face primaries this season that imperil their survival : a poll thursday morning found @entity105 down 5 points to a tea party - backed challenger in @entity117 , and @entity106 failed to secure a 60 % supermajority at his party 's convention in @entity121 , sending his race to a primary			1
only two years ago in @entity121 , another stalwart @entity17 who had worked with @entity15 , @entity124 , was deposed by an ideologically purer primary challenger			1
in the @entity96 , meanwhile , the once - robust cadre of " @entity15 " -- moderate to conservative members of the liberal party -- has been winnowed out , with two more members ( reps			1
@entity130 and @entity131 of @entity132 ) defeated in primaries this past tuesday by opponents from their left flanks			0
as of 2010 , there were as many as 54 @entity137 , but the midterms knocked their caucus down to 26			0
with retirements and primaries , that number will probably be well below 20 by next january -- an effect that further turns @entity15 into the party of the left			2
some activists -- conservative @entity149 among them -- argue that over time , this purification will be good for the @entity151 so far , the task of governing has gotten much tougher , and what little trust is left among the parties is evaporating			1
as the parties become more ideological , it 's easier to demonize the other side and harder to rationalize working with it -- both to your colleagues and your constituents			1
woe to be you in your next primary if you have consorted with the enemy			0
under heavy pressures for party conformity , legislation by nature becomes a more partisan undertaking			2
hard to believe it now , but big programs like @entity171 in the 1960s , or tax and @entity175 reform in the 1980s , passed with broad bipartisan support			0
our latest legislative achievements , on the other hand ( think health care , the stimulus or @entity183 reform ) , have been almost entirely driven by one party			2
more often than not , gridlock and obstruction soon follow			2
as scholar @entity188 has wisely noted , it becomes " a zero - sum mentality : if they win , we lose			0
" as @entity188 and others have theorized , all this sniping saps the public 's trust in the government , but it does something equally insidious , too : it saps trust between the parties , completing the vicious cycle and making compromise even tougher			2
so it 's crucial to bolster the men and women of courage in politics : the ones who can act as ambassadors between these increasingly dug - in parties and who can kindle that small flame of trust that has almost gone out			2
sens. @entity214 ( @entity215 ) and @entity216 ( @entity217 ) and a handful of others , for example , have launched laudable work on this count in the @entity95 , pulling together small , quiet dinners with legislators from both sides of the aisle who are strong in principles but equally strong in their commitment to moving the ball forward for the country			2
getting by on the little victories can help restore health to the process , too			0
the @entity233 coming together on patent reform at the end of 2011 , the @entity236 in early april and ( potentially ) on extending low interest rates on student loans in coming days may seem like small potatoes , but these compromises can be confidence builders			0
like water over a stone , they can slowly but steadily wear away some of the mistrust and acrimony			0
@entity9 was right on many big things , but on this one , he was dead wrong			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors .			0

from @entity9 in the 1930s on , some have argued that parties should be polarized
we *'re* seeing consequences of @entity21 as liberal party , @entity17 as conservative one , authors say
they say this has led to gridlock and the loss of talented *leaders* who can work with other party
@entity269 , @entity270 : @entity87 , @entity79 have been firing up ideological base of their parties
