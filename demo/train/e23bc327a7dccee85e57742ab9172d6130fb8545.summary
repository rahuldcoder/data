" they 're kidnapping , stealing our festival , " said founder and until - now executive director @entity13			2
" it 's not a simple case of censorship , of them shutting it down			2
it 's an abduction , " he said during a small press conference in his living room			0
" on the one hand , they 're taking it away from us and on the other hand , they are organizing it themselves through official institutions			0
" the government was not immediately available for comment			1
the @entity35 , a hugely popular three - day rave on a beach outside @entity0 , was launched in 1998 by @entity37 and a handful of friends			1
last year , it attracted some 20,000 people			0
" up until now , we were tolerated , " @entity37 said			0
often referred to as " @entity4 's @entity42 , " the festival 's focus has traditionally been on apolitical electronic music and @entity46 , although last year the main attraction was the polemic hip - hop group @entity49			1
@entity37 said they collaborated with government officials on logistics and security and sometimes faced pressure			2

" it has n't always been comfortable			0
" less well - known outside @entity4 than some of the smaller , more political , rap festivals , @entity63 has long been a popular musical event for young people on the island			1
