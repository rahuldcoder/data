-- we tend to think of the 2008 financial crisis as the atom bomb that smashed the @entity5 economy , and from which we have yet to recover			1
but what if our economic woes started far earlier than that ? the recession officially began in december 2007 , and some scholars , including @entity12 of the @entity13 , argue that if we measure gross domestic product by looking at incomes rather than expenditures , it actually started in the last three months of 2006			1
that is , we started digging the hole even earlier than is commonly understood			0
and now a number of scholars are suggesting that our troubles really began in the early 2000s , yet they were masked by an unsustainable housing boom			1
the recovery has been extremely uneven , with college - educated workers faring better than non-college - educated workers			0
this has led a number of economic thinkers to suggest that the persistence of high unemployment flows in no small part from a structural dynamic			1
just as the transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy created tremendous dislocation in the depression era , and the transition from an industrial to a service - oriented economy devastated @entity5 's @entity42 in the sharp recession of the early 1980s , one possibility is that we are living through another painful transition , only we do n't have a good sense of what the @entity5 will look like on the other side			1
this is the view embraced by thinkers on the left , like @entity51 of @entity52 , and in the center , like @entity54 of the @entity56 's @entity55 , as well as many conservatives and libertarians who advocate structural reform			2
though these thinkers acknowledge that weak consumer demand plays a role , they vary considerably in what they consider the appropriate formula for jump - starting growth and they are convinced that fixing the demand problem alone is n't enough			0
others maintain that our current economic stagnation is almost entirely about weak consumer demand that flows from the damage the housing bust did to household balance sheets , and that some combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus should be our highest priority			1
this view is most commonly associated with liberals such as @entity79 columnist and @entity81 economist @entity80			0
@entity82 : @entity83 faces barrage of data a related view , which attributes dismal growth to a monetary policy that is far too tight , has been championed by the libertarian @entity90 economist @entity89 and a growing number of right - leaning thinkers			0
these thinkers tend to maintain that the " structuralists " are missing the point			0
even if there is a big economic transition is going on , its importance is swamped by the more straightforward shortfall in consumer demand			2
a number of economists , many of them based at the @entity56 , have been devising new ways to test these theories to determine what has really happened to cause high unemployment			0
last year , @entity107 of the @entity108 ; and @entity109 of the @entity56 's @entity55 released a paper arguing that the central driver of the decline in employment levels between 2007 and 2009 -- the massive economic blow from which we have yet to recover -- was a drop in demand caused by shocks to household balance sheets			1
@entity107 and @entity121 tested this proposition by comparing employment declines in high - leverage counties , in which households had higher ratios of debt to disposable income , and in low leverage counties , in which households had lower ratios			0
they found that high leverage counties saw a steeper drop in " non-tradable employment " than low leverage counties , which led them to conclude that consumer demand shocks were indeed key			0
the non-tradable part matters because employment in tradable industries such as manufacturing depends on the health of the national and global marketplace while non-tradable employment ( think restaurant waiters or physical therapists ) depends on the health of the local marketplace			2
of the 6.2 million jobs lost between 2007 and 2009 , @entity107 and @entity121 attributed 4 million to this hit to consumer demand			0
though @entity107 and @entity121 do n't make explicit policy recommendations , one implication of their findings is that the best way to restore economic growth might be to address household balance sheet weakness directly , whether through debt forgiveness or an increase in inflation			2
debt forgiveness would allow households to reduce mortgage payments , thus giving them more to spend , and inflation would erode the value of accumulated debt , thus making it more manageable			0
just this month , @entity170 of the @entity56 's @entity171 and @entity172 and @entity173 , both of the @entity55 , offered a somewhat different take			2
rather than focus exclusively on the period since 2007 , @entity170 , @entity172 , and @entity173 analyze shifts in the composition of employment from 2000 to 2007			0
specifically , they focus on how declines in manufacturing employment interacted with housing booms in different cities across the @entity5			1
essentially , the authors find that while a negative shock to manufacturing employment had a big negative impact on employment for non-college - educated men , a positive shock to housing prices more than made up for it			1
until , that is , the housing bust wiped out these gains			2
and so @entity170 , @entity172 , and @entity173 conclude that in the absence of the housing boom , the unemployment crisis facing non-college - educated men would have arrived much sooner			1
in other words , the 37 % rise in housing prices between 2000 and 2007 functioned as a kind of invisible stimulus that shielded non-college - educated men from most of the fallout from the collapse in manufacturing jobs , 3.5 million of which evaporated over that same period			1
by way of comparison , there are 12 million manufacturing jobs in the @entity5 today			1
one irony of the housing boom is that it convinced millions of @entity5 men that there was no need to retrain for a new economic landscape , a decision that many might now regret			1
the views of @entity220 and @entity121 and @entity170 , @entity172 , and @entity173 are not necessarily at odds			0
@entity170 , @entity172 , and @entity173 are very open to the possibility that household balance sheet weakness has played a significant role in the persistence of high unemployment			0
yet there are interesting tensions between these views			0
by offering a compelling structural explanation for the steep employment decline among non-college - educated men in the wake of the housing bust , @entity170 , @entity172 , and @entity173 reinforce the view advanced by , among others , @entity236 's @entity54			1
in his well - regarded book " @entity238 , " @entity54 argued that one of the reasons the federal government subsidized mortgages and pushed for low interest rates is that politicians saw it as a cheap and easy way to boost the economic prospects of low - and middle - income households in a deindustrializing economy			1
if @entity170 , @entity172 , and @entity173 are correct , tackling household balance sheet weakness might not be enough to address the economic challenges facing these men			2
rather , men who were well - suited for either manufacturing or residential construction work will have to be retrained for jobs in very different fields			2
a darker possibility is that many of these men will drop out of the formal labor force entirely , and will find themselves living on the margins of society			0
this is the kernel of truth in the debate over outsourcing			0
though the offshoring of production has greatly benefited the @entity5 economy in many important respects -- by lowering the cost of goods and services , by increasing the demand for skilled labor , and by facilitating innovation , among other things -- it has contributed to the deterioration of the labor market position of non-college - educated men			1
automation has played a far larger role in declining manufacturing employment than offshoring , and indeed offshoring can be seen as nothing more than a transitional step as increasingly sophisticated machines start displacing less - skilled foreign labor			0
but it is offshoring that sparks the most anxiety in @entity5 workers			1
by documenting the scale of @entity5 manufacturing 's decline , @entity170 , @entity172 , and @entity173 have done a great deal to shed light on why			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity300 .			2

@entity300 : we think of the 2008 crash as the bomb that caused today 's economic woes
he says *evidence* is building that @entity5 economy was troubled years before that
experts say the housing boom hid the dire effects of manufacturing *layoffs* , he says
@entity300 : the power of the outsourcing issue flows from sharp decline in manufacturing
