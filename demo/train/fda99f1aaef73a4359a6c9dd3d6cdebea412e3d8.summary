@entity1 the @entity3 is looking into claims that @entity5 -- already considered the wealthiest terrorist group on record -- may be harvesting organs from slain civilians and gaining financial benefits by trafficking the body parts , officials said wednesday			1
but @entity13 's ambassador to the @entity3 , @entity12 , said the issue has not been officially discussed			1
@entity12 said there was no proof or evidence of the claim made by @entity20 's ambassador to the @entity3			1
the @entity20 ambassador , @entity21 , on tuesday urged the @entity22 to investigate the deaths of 12 doctors in @entity25 , @entity20			1
he said they were killed after refusing to remove organs from bodies			0
" some of the bodies we found are mutilated ... that means some parts are missing , " he told reporters , adding that there were openings in the back of the bodies where the kidneys would be located			0
" this is clearly something bigger than we think , " @entity21 said			1
the plunder of bodies for usable organs and tissues is widespread , according to @entity44 , director of @entity45 , a @entity47 - based documentation and research project			0
" organ theft during wars , civil wars , dirty wars , wars involving undisciplined armies is not uncommon , " @entity44 , chair of @entity47 's doctoral program in medical anthropology , said in an email			2
the @entity3 's @entity20 mission on wednesday said @entity21 was not granting interviews			1
" at this point we 're not in a position to corroborate what he says , but obviously any source of illegal financing of groups such as @entity5 or other extremist groups is extremely worrisome , " @entity3 spokesman @entity60 told @entity2			1
@entity70 , the @entity3 special envoy handling @entity20 , said the organ theft claim would be investigated			1
" we have seen these reports as well , " he said			0
" however , i do not want to hasten to confirm anything before we study them in greater detail			0
" @entity70 said reports that the group " is using a human trafficking as part of its sources of income " have circulated for months			2
" i can not speak to the extent of that issue until we finalize our analysis of the problem but if one looks at the broader picture , it is very clear that the brutality and the tactics that ( @entity5 ) is using expand by the day			2
" the @entity92 said it was aware of the " deeply disturbing comments " about the alleged organ trafficking but was n't able to confirm them			0
" we also have no reason to doubt them given other similar atrocities that have been documented and other heinous crimes for which @entity5 has proudly taken credit , " the @entity92 said , using another acronym for the militant group			1
@entity21 said there is a market in @entity106 for the stolen organs			2
the terror group has taken over airports where the body parts could be flown out in deals arranged between middlemen and buyers , he said			2
the mutilated bodies have been found in shallow graves over the last several weeks , he said			0
speaking to the @entity22 at a regular meeting on @entity20 on tuesday , @entity21 cited what he said were crimes of genocide by @entity5 -- " without even mentioning the traffic of human organs and the theft and trafficking of archaeological items and oil			1
" " these terrorist groups have desecrated all human values , " he said			0
" they have committed the most heinous criminal terrorist acts against the @entity20 people -- whether @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134			1
" last month , @entity137 's semiofficial @entity136 news agency and other outlets reported that @entity5 had announced the opening of a medical school in its main stronghold in northern @entity142			2
" dead bodies , once they are disarticulated , pulverized , processed , freeze - dried , etc. , are so far removed from the ' human ' person that they are simply commodities , " @entity44 said			0
" the demand for fresh organs and tissues ... is insatiable			0
" @entity44 said fresh kidneys from " the brain dead or from those executed with the assistance of trained organ harvesters are the blood diamonds of illicit and criminal trafficking			0
" how @entity5 is run @entity5 has been defined as the wealthiest terrorist group on record , using a combination of black - market oil sales , extortion and sophisticated social media to raise money to fund its expansion into @entity20 and @entity142 , according to the @entity165			1
the terrorist group pulls in about $ 1 million a day , according to the @entity165			1
extortion , such as demanding money from truck drivers and threatening to blow up businesses , is another revenue stream for the group , in addition to robbing banks and gold shops			0
the income helps finance a growing stream of suicide attacks and assassinations , officials said			0
it also aids the recruitment of @entity132 tribal fighters and finances spectacular prison raids that liberate hundreds of fighters , as well as attacks on police patrols			0
@entity5 controls vast areas of northern and western @entity20 , as well as much of northeastern @entity142 -- and exercises draconian authority in areas as far apart as @entity190 in western @entity20 and @entity192 province in northern @entity142			1
the group also continues to pick up endorsements and pledges of allegiance from other jihadist groups , most notably in @entity198 and @entity199			0
everything to know about the rise of @entity5 @entity2 's @entity202 and @entity203 contributed to this report .			2
