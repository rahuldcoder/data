@entity1 videos are part of today 's new reality			2
one of the many to hit social media has the viewer hearing a recitation of @entity9 verses describing a jihad in the battle for @entity14 's @entity13 energy facility			0
@entity14 's largest oil field is one of a handful now under the firm grip of the terrorist organization			2
@entity1 may not be operating the type of polished pipeline infrastructure one would find in southern @entity22 around @entity23 , but @entity22 oil ministry officials say an old fashioned truck network for this crude is active and serving distribution needs			1
and now , after nearly three months of heated battle in @entity22 , one can see a clearer picture of where @entity1 stands as an energy player			1
it popped up on the global radar in june by seizing assets in @entity22 , but building on those early gains , according to a number of energy sources , is proving difficult			2
august was not a good month for @entity1			0
it lost its battle for one of @entity42 's big fields , with potential production of 600,000 barrels a day , and could not keep control of @entity22 's largest refinery at @entity46 , on the main road to @entity48			1
what they do hold , @entity22 officials suggest , will need maintenance			0
so far , it is getting that work done only through intimidation of on - site engineers who are not loyal to the @entity1 cause			0
@entity1 ' income from oil is falling as they struggle to control the personnel within refineries , according to @entity62 , a spokesman at @entity22 's @entity64			1
" at first they got a large sum of money by seizing inventories , but this can not last , " he added			0
the @entity71 estimates @entity1 is producing about 30,000 barrels a day in @entity22 and 50,000 daily in @entity14			1
on a black market price of $ 40 a barrel , it is earning $ 1.2 million a day in @entity22 and $ 2 million in @entity14			1
energy traders and regional security specialists tell me supplies are being funneled into regional oil importing countries of @entity82 , @entity83 , and @entity14			2
" they use oil tank trucks instead of oil pipes			0
there are about 210 oil tank trucks smuggling oil to @entity83 and other places every day , " @entity86 , @entity87 manager of the @entity71 told me			0
the transport may be rudimentary , but this network of black market traders stretches back to the days of @entity95 , when @entity22 was under @entity97 sanctions in the 1990s			1
" we are not talking about people who own a couple of trucks and tanker trucks , " said @entity98 , senior editor at the @entity99			0
" we are talking about certain market - oriented people who have organizations that trade in illegal oil			0
" @entity1 has taken a page from @entity95 's war playbook , when he left @entity110			0
still pictures of fields torched have emerged this week of fields outside of @entity48 when it was pushed out by @entity22 forces			2
oil strategists say @entity22 's national military and the @entity119 forces of the @entity121 region are trying to strike a fine balance			0
they want to keep @entity1 out of their prized fields and refineries , but they do n't want to destroy infrastructure which would take years and millions of dollars to rebuild			2
while @entity1 has clearly suffered setbacks , there is also a stark reality			1
the organization may be falling short of designs to become a " state " oil company , but revenue of over $ 3 million a day can certainly finance its operation of terror			1

@entity1 controls several oil fields in @entity22 and @entity14 , which it is using to finance its terror operations
however running refineries is difficult and @entity1 has suffered setbacks in areas such as @entity46
it is estimated to be earning more than $ 3 million a day in black market oil sales
it may be struggling to increase that *--* but the funds are plenty to finance its terror operation
