-- friday morning , a @entity2 school for young children was turned into a living hell			1
it had been a place of innocence , a haven where boys and girls learned , laughed and played			0
now , it was a place of shock and sorrow , a grisly crime scene			2
the shooting spree at @entity16 shattered sleepy @entity17 and it shattered @entity19 's notions of what constitutes a safe place			1
it happened just days after a gunman shot three people , killing two of them , at an @entity27 mall filled with @entity29 shoppers			1
for three days that place also became a crime scene			2
earlier this summer , another place , a movie theater in @entity34 was also marked a crime scene after a gunman shot 12 people to death at a screening of the newest @entity41 movie timeline : school violence in the @entity19 there have been other recent slaughters that have rattled @entity19 including one at an @entity48 shopping center where people came to meet rep. @entity50			1
these are not places of darkness			2
they are not places where people expect the worst of mankind to surface			1
" there really is no safe place			2
that is just our imagination , " said @entity61 , a forensic and clinical psychologist at the @entity63			2
and what is perceived as safe seems to be shrinking after a spate of high - profile crimes			2
places like the @entity17 school are part of an assumptive world , said psychologist @entity75 of @entity76			1
they are places where people take their safety for granted			1
" events like the @entity2 school shooting shatter that notion and we are left reeling			1
" what we held as our ideal has now been turned upside down			1
" even president @entity86 wiped away tears and paused to collect himself friday as he spoke of " beautiful little children " killed friday			2
" our hearts , " he said , " are broken today			0
" we 've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years and each time i learn the news , i react not as a president , but as anybody else would , as a parent , " @entity86 said			0
" and that was especially true today			0
i know there 's not a parent in @entity19 who does n't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do			1
" parents : it ' does n't seem possible ' or feel anxiety over having to send their children back to school on monday			1
it 's not that violence has not occurred in elementary schools before			1
in 1989 , a 24 - year - old drifter aimed his @entity110 and killed five children on an elementary school playground in @entity113			1
as far back as 1959 , a convict exploded a suitcase of dynamite on a school playground in @entity118 and killed five people , including three children			1
but the school shootings that have made recent headlines , starting with @entity123 in 1999 , have mainly occurred at high schools			2
the fact that the @entity2 shootings , one of the deadliest in @entity19 history , involved such young children makes the tragedy that much harder to fathom , @entity75 said			2
" we begin to think : is it safe to even step outside ? " @entity75 said			0
some people deal with that potentially debilitating thought with denial -- that this sort of thing happens in @entity2 or in @entity27 or in @entity34 but it can never happen where they are			1
" you have to tell yourself that , " @entity61 said			0
" otherwise you will never go to a mall or to a school			0
" it 's already intimidating enough with metal detectors everywhere from airports to libraries			0
as horrific as the @entity17 shootings are , the reality is that most schools in @entity19 still are safe , said @entity149 , director of the @entity150			1
it 's just that people 's perceptions are more easily swayed in this era of instant information			1
he likened it to a news story about a shark attack			0
" what you have is this notion of one person being bitten by a shark in @entity165 and the news goes around the world and all of a sudden , you think shark bites are prevalent , " he said			0
photos : shock and horror friday 's shooting was almost instantly on television : images of horror repeated many times			1
that is why , perhaps , that some people worry more , @entity149 said			0
" the only thing we can do is to sit down with our children and talk about it , especially with the little ones , " @entity61 said			0
talk about this new world we live in			0
@entity184 , whose daughter attends @entity16 , did just that			0
" it was only a week ago we were talking about this type of situation and i said the chances of it happening are one in a zillion at @entity17 , " he said			1
" i was wrong about that			0
" he said he has been doing his best to soothe his children			0
" it 's funny -- a bomb hit and there is a lot of smoke and it 's still here , " he said			0
" i have n't had enough time to really plan , but hopefully by the time they do go back to school , i will have done a good enough job of making them feel as comfortable ( as i can )			2
" his children were already asking him when this might happen again			0
the game , he said , was changed from this moment on			0
opinion : now is the time to talk guns , mental illness			0

places that were considered safe are turning into crime scenes
that friday 's shooting happened in an elementary school was especially hard to take
the @entity17 tragedy turned everything upside down , said a psychologist
some people cope with this kind of tragedy by thinking it ca n't happen to them
