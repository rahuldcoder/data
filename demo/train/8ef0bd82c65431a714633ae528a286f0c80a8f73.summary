-- @entity1 , the drummer , multi-instrumentalist and singer for @entity4 who kept the band 's heart for more than three decades , died " peacefully " thursday afternoon , according to his record label , @entity7			1
" he was surrounded by family , friends and band mates and will be remembered by all he touched as a brilliant musician and a beautiful soul , " the record label 's statement said			2
a statement from the @entity16 , which inducted @entity17 in 1994 , called him the backbone of @entity4			1
" as a member of the one of the most influential rock and roll groups , @entity4 , @entity1 produced music that was as much timeless as it was timely , " it said			1
" in the late 1960s and early 1970s when the country was divided , @entity4 still projected a sense of unity and brought generations of fans together from all over the world			1
" @entity17 had a voice unlike any other in rock music : definitively @entity33 , soulful and gritty , an oak - barreled whiskey that sometimes went down with a fiery kick			1
he could be mournful , calling up ghosts , as he did in " @entity38 " and the half - chanted chorus of " @entity40 )			2
" he could be playful , as he was in " @entity41 " and " @entity42 , " where in the latter he lunges into the " take a load off , @entity46 " chorus with joyful abandon			2
and he could belt in sheer pleasure , galloping through " the @entity49 " or simply lending his unique harmonies to " @entity51 " and " @entity52			0
" it was an @entity54 voice			0
@entity17 had been suffering from throat cancer			1
despite reducing his voice to a rasp in recent years , it had not robbed him of his spirit			0
at his home in @entity63 , @entity64 , he regularly hosted the @entity65 , weekly concerts that attracted sell - out crowds and all - star support from the likes of @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity73 's @entity72			2
in the past decade , he recorded two albums , 2007 's " @entity75 " and 2009 's " @entity76 , " that won @entity77			2
and he occasionally took the show on the road , making appearances at @entity82 's @entity81 , the @entity83 and @entity85 ' @entity84			2
music , tv industries mourn @entity88 but @entity17 is best known for providing the vocals to such rock ' n ' roll standards as " @entity42 " and " @entity38 , " the latter a tale of a @entity94 veteran sizing up his wasted land			1
that song was credited to @entity4 's primary songwriter , @entity97 , who has said he was inspired by tales of the @entity33 from @entity17 and others			1
certainly , there was never a doubt who would sing it : the @entity103 - born , @entity33 - mythologizing @entity17			1
" i aimed it right at him , i wrote it for him , he gets to say it all , " @entity97 told @entity104 in 1969			0
@entity1 was born @entity1 in @entity106 , @entity103 , on may 26 , 1940 , the son of a cotton farmer			0
he told @entity0 that he was inspired by " the old traveling medicine tent shows " that would make the rounds in the @entity33			0
" they had comedians and wine and music			0
always a lot of music , " he said in 2010			0
after high school , he joined @entity118 ' band , the @entity4			1
when the @entity4 moved to @entity119 in the early ' 60s , @entity118 and @entity17 recruited several local musicians , including @entity97 , @entity121 , @entity122 and finally @entity123			1
@entity118 left the band in 1963 , and the group renamed itself @entity4			1
the next year the group met @entity126 , beginning one of rock 's great partnerships			1
the group , already known for its blazing live performances , ended up accompanying @entity126 on his famous 1965 - 66 tours -- though @entity17 left by the end of 1965 , upset at the vicious reaction the newly electric @entity126 was getting from audiences			1
@entity17 rejoined the @entity4 in 1967 , playing on what became known as @entity126 's " @entity137			1
" the group also wrote and recorded its own songs in the same place , a house called " @entity141 " in @entity142 , @entity64			0
renamed @entity4 , the group put out its debut album , " @entity143 , " in 1968 , to rapturous reviews			1
" six months are left in this proselytizing year of music ... but i have chosen my album for 1968			0
' @entity143 ' is an event and should be treated as one , " wrote @entity148 in his @entity104 review of the lp			0
the music was something new in @entity54 rock : both ancient and modern , rooted in the past and eschewing the psychedelic sounds then in vogue			2
the group , too , looked like something just emerged from a 19th century daguerreotype			0
and @entity126 did the cover and wrote or co-wrote three of the songs			0
the next album , 1969 's " @entity4 , " earned them the january 12 , 1970 , cover of @entity165 , headlined " @entity166 of @entity167			1
" the magazine 's artwork featured a menacing - looking @entity17 , bearded and hatted , looking every bit the @entity54 prophet he sometimes sounded			1
the group was , and remains , hugely influential ; the whole alt - country movement can trace at least some of its roots to @entity4			1
( @entity177 , the leader of the @entity178 , named one of his earlier groups " @entity181 " after the protagonist of " @entity38			0
" ) @entity183 and @entity184 were huge fans , and their song " @entity4 " drew its character 's name from @entity17			1
@entity4 put out several more albums , including " @entity190 , " " @entity191 " and " @entity192 , " but touring and internal dissension took their toll			1
in 1976 , the group decided to bow out with an all - star concert , " @entity198 , " filmed by @entity199 and considered one of the great music concert documentaries			0
the tensions of the band were obvious on screen , and @entity17 in particular did n't hide his anger			1
in his 1993 autobiography , he talked about his disgust , as @entity210 observed in a 2002 article on the film 's anniversary			2
" as far as i was concerned , the movie was a disaster , " @entity17 wrote in the book , " @entity52			2
" he also disputed some of @entity97 's songwriting credits , though @entity97 questioned @entity17 's version			1
" who did the work ? i tried , i begged @entity4 to write songs or help me write songs -- all the guys			2
i always encouraged everybody to write , " he told @entity210			0
" you ca n't make somebody do what they do n't want to do or ca n't do , and he 's not a songwriter			2
" @entity97 , in a statement sent to @entity0 wednesday , said he was " shocked and so saddened to hear that my old band mate , @entity1 , was in the final stages of his battle with cancer			2
it hit me really hard because i thought he had beaten throat cancer and had no idea that he was this ill. " @entity4 is one of the most extraordinary talented people i 've ever known and very much like an older brother to me			1
i am so grateful i got to see him one last time and will miss him and love him forever , " @entity97 said			0
after the @entity4 's split , @entity17 recorded a handful of solo albums and toured with his old bandmates , minus @entity97			1
there were losses there , too : @entity122 committed suicide in 1986 , and @entity121 passed away in 1999			0
@entity17 occasionally played with other groups , notably @entity252 's @entity251			1
he also appeared in several movies , the best remembered of which is " @entity256 , " which won @entity257 an @entity258 for her portrayal of country star @entity260			0
@entity17 had some hard times in the late ' 90s			2
his studio was hit with a fire			0
the throat cancer took his voice and medical bills threatened his house			1
" you got to pick one -- pay your medical bills or pay the mortgage			0
most people ca n't do both , and i 'm not different , " he told @entity0			0
but the @entity275 , intended as a one - off " rent party , " according to @entity17 , helped raise money and revived his career			2
" if i had my way about it , we 'd probably do it every night , " he said			0
" i never get tired of it			0
" indeed , it seemed there was nothing he enjoyed more than playing music for a few friends			0
in 2008 , @entity17 received a @entity289 with @entity4			1
he was n't present to receive it			0
he held a @entity65 in @entity63 instead			0
