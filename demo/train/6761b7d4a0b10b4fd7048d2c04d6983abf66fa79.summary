-- police say a @entity3 , @entity4 , man had the audacity to return to the jail where he posted a $ 400 bond with counterfeit bills , demanding a refund			1
@entity10 was charged with shoplifting july 7 , but his bail was incorrectly written up			2
when he found out , authorities say , he returned to the @entity13 , @entity4 , jail the following week to demand his money back			1
@entity10 appeared in @entity15 on thursday , and this time his bail was set far higher			0
according to @entity13 police chief @entity17 , the department issued a warrant for @entity10 's arrest after his counterfeit bail posting of $ 400 , but because he was a @entity3 resident , it was out of jurisdiction			1
though @entity3 police were alerted to the claims , they were n't exactly banging down his door			0
" even though it was a $ 5,000 warrant for his arrest , they have bigger issues over in @entity3 , being the murder capital of the world , " @entity17 said			0
@entity10 had posted bail using at least two bills bearing identical serial numbers , police say , and the serial numbers also matched those on one of the bills found on him when he returned to the @entity13 jail to reclaim his extra $ 200			1
upon further inspection , @entity17 said , the counterfeit bills @entity10 used to post bail were of poor paper quality , although the printing appeared very accurate			1
the duplicate serial numbers were the giveaway , he said			1
" he was surprised that he was discovered , " @entity17 said			0
@entity51 prosecutor 's office representative @entity49 said that because @entity10 did not produce the counterfeit bills but merely attempted to purchase goods with them , the official charge was theft by unlawful taking			0
on thursday , at @entity10 's first appearance in @entity15 , his bail was set at $ 7,500 , because of outstanding charges from @entity3 added on to the @entity51 charges			2
@entity10 's case will be presented before a grand jury within six weeks			0
in the meantime , until he can post bail with legitimate bills , he will be held at @entity67 .			2
