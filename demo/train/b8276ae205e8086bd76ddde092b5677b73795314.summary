-- what applies in real estate , may also be said of free speech -- it is all about location , location , location			2
now a @entity9 fight between the @entity10 and anti-bush protesters has reached the nation 's highest court , testing the discretion of those using their often split - second authority to shield the president			1
the government told the justices wednesday in oral arguments that the actions of agents were related to security , while the lawyer representing the demonstrators called it unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination			1
at issue : legal immunity for the agents , and whether their actions violated " clearly established " law in performance of official duties			2
the court was at times animated , perplexed , and exasperated during a one - hour public session , but appeared ready to reject the free - speech claims , which could end a pending , decade - old lawsuit			1
justice @entity38 spoke for many of his colleagues when he said the job of protecting the nation 's leader by this " special protective force " was especially important and unique			1
" everyone understands the danger			2
you ca n't run a risk , " of allowing the president to be subject to harm , he said			1
" at the same time , no one wants a @entity52 that is above the law , and we have examples of history of what happens when you do that			2
so everyone is looking for some kind of line that permits the protection but denies " suppression of legitimate protest			2
the incident happened during a campaign stop in the final hectic weeks before the 2004 election			1
president @entity69 made a last - minute decision to dine at the @entity71 in southern @entity72			1
local law enforcement had initially allowed about 250 anti-bush protesters to stand near an alleyway on the same side of the street as the restaurant and adjacent hotel where the president and his entourage were staying			1
pro-bush supporters were across the street			0
@entity69 wanted to eat on the outdoor patio and the @entity10 said the change initially forced agents to order local police and state police to move the @entity90 crowd across the street			1
fifteen minutes later , those demonstrators were moved again , about two blocks further from the inn			1
they claim it was done solely to put them out of earshot of the dinner guests			0
the @entity100 people were allowed to stay , resulting in them being closer to @entity69			1
seven anti-bush demonstrators eventually sued , helped by the @entity102			1
among them , @entity103 , an organic farmer and local activist			0
" in challenging the immunity and lack of constitutional accountability of individuals operating under the cover of government secrecy , this case continues to set precedent while addressing one of the darker corners of our legal system , " he said in a blog post			1
" if those in power are actively or passively given permission to act without accountability , abuse of our most basic rights will continue to occur			0
" many of the facts of the case are in dispute , and a trial has not been held pending resolution of the immunity questions			1
in oral arguments , most of the justices appeared mildly frustrated with the lawyers appearing before them , while trying to explore the limits of when an agent 's actions become impermissible			1
justice @entity138 questioned the government 's assertion the @entity90 crowd was moved to keep anyone out of range of committing violence			1
" in fact , the @entity100 demonstrators were across the street pretty much at a diagonal to the president , and they were permitted to remain there the entire time			1
they had a throwing distance of a bomb or a shooting distance as well			0
" justice @entity154 repeatedly pressed the @entity156 lawyer to clarify the government 's position on whether and when " subjective intent " of law enforcement should be considered			1
" would you say that under your view of the case , that there is a @entity9 interest that protesters have , but that it is virtually unenforceable in the context of crowd control ? " asked @entity154			1
" because it seems to me that if this complaint does n't survive , nothing will			0
" @entity172 tried to articulate a nuanced position , saying some kinds of free speech claims could still be pressed , even if the individual agents prevail in this particular case			1
he mentioned current lawsuits challenging to @entity10 policy restricting the kinds of signs displayed on a parade route			0
that clearly irked justice @entity184			0
" i really do n't understand what the government is doing here			0
it seems to me you want to win this case , but not too big , " she said , bringing laughter			2
" i would think it is in the interest of the @entity194 and the @entity10 to say there are no " broadly - applied @entity9 claims against the agents			0
the lawyer for the protesters came under tough questioning as well			2
chief justice @entity200 pointed at lawyer @entity201 with a blunt hypothetical			0
" you 're the head of the @entity10 detail			0
you 've got to evacuate the president right away			2
do you go through the @entity90 crowd or through the @entity100 crowd ? you 've got to decide right now quickly			0
you have to make a split - second decision			0
" i think whichever way provides the clearest egress , " he said , arms outstretched			0
@entity200 : " no , no. they are both the same			0
that was one of your propositions , that there is no way to distinguish there			0
you 've taken too long to decide			0
" @entity200 continued , " if we 're trying to decide whether viewpoint can ever be a security justification , we have to consider all of the possible situations			0
" @entity201 admitted he was no security expert			0
" that 's actually not much of an answer for lots of reasons , but the most , if you do n't know , how are we supposed to know ? " @entity138 said			2
while the agents may win at the high court , the justices seemed torn about adopting a particular general principle to guide future such @entity9 claims			2
a ruling in the current dispute is expected by the early summer			0
the case is @entity239 ( 13 - 115 ) .			2
