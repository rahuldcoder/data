-- a @entity2 appeals court has put on hold a @entity6 judge 's order for @entity7 to pay $ 1.3bn into escrow for holders of its defaulted debt by december 15 , quelling fears of an imminent default			1
the @entity14 granted the stay and set a hearing for february 27			0
there was no immediate reaction from the @entity7 government			1
last week , judge @entity20 of @entity6 ordered @entity21 to make the escrow payment at the same time as it is due to pay more than $ 3bn to holders of restructured debt			1
the government had requested the stay in an emergency motion filed late on monday and has since floated the idea of asking congress to lift a so - called lock law in order to reopen a debt swap to holdout creditors led by the @entity2 fund @entity32 , but with a tough writedown			1
the holdouts refused debt swaps in 2005 and 2010 , which restructured about 93 per cent of the almost $ 100bn on which @entity7 defaulted in 2001			1
the government is barred by law from making them any better offer			0
" we are waiting for the appeals court decision			0
until there is a decision on the matter , we have nothing to add to what we have said in recent days , " @entity41 , the economy minister , told reporters hours before that court ruled			0
the court said @entity7 must now file papers by december 28			1
amicus briefs and papers from other interested parties -- including holders of restructured debt led by @entity56 and including @entity57 , one of the world 's biggest hedge funds -- are due by january 4			1
the @entity62 - led parties then have until january 25 to make their case and @entity7 has until february 1 to reply before the hearing			1
after december , @entity7 's next payment on its restructured bonds is due in march			1
" the @entity14 's order signals its understanding of the serious constitutional and equitable issues at stake , " said @entity67 , a lawyer for the exchange bondholders			0
" the stay issued late today ensures that the exchange bondholders will receive their rightful payments through december , and the court can carefully consider the significant issues and interests that are involved before rendering its final ruling			0
" president @entity80 had earlier said @entity7 would keep paying			1
" when the swap was last opened , we reached 93 per cent acceptance			0
we have paid on time since 2005 , without access to the [ international ] capital market , with our own resources			0
and we are going to continue to do so because we are going to honour our commitments as befits a country which has recovered its self - esteem , " she told an industrialists ´ conference also attended by president @entity90 of @entity91			1
@entity7 's suggestion that it could reopen the swap again was greeted enthusiastically by political and business leaders at home			2
analysts say it is a belated concession to " vulture funds " , to whom the government has until now vowed never to pay a dime			2
but it is not one that will necessarily sway the court , let alone the " holdouts " who spurned the two previous offers			0
nor is it likely to resolve an intractable dispute that threatens to trigger a new default			0
indeed , on tuesday @entity116 slashed @entity7 's sovereign credit rating five steps to @entity119 from b on " increased probability " of a default			2
@entity128 , a scholar at the @entity129 ( @entity129 ) think - tank and former chief negotiator of the @entity125 , the nation 's biggest creditor in the 2005 swap , said : " simply reopening the exchange is unlikely to satisfy the court 's concerns			2
the holdouts will not accept a reopening			0
a reopening is simply a way to show that the holdouts have not been disenfranchised of their rights			0
" @entity7 passed the lock law at the end of 2004 to twist bondholders ' arms to accept a tough restructuring in 2005 that offered about 30 cents on the dollar			2
holders of about three - quarters of the almost $ 100bn on which @entity7 defaulted in 2001 took the " haircut "			1
but with a chunk of debt still outstanding and increasing holdout litigation , @entity7 suspended the lock law at the end of 2009 and reopened the exchange			1
after two good - faith offers , the government considered the holdouts history			2
ms @entity80 said a ruling that did not take account of the 93 per cent was " absolutely inequitable "			2
she said @entity7 had become a " countermodel " to the @entity159 ´ s recommendations " in a world in which financial capital and its derivatives have set themselves up as masters			2
and want to punish us ¨			0
@entity168 , an economist , said talk of lifting the lock law was " obviously coming a bit late			0
they only did it now because they ´ re on the ropes "			0
if @entity7 does end up having to pay the holdouts more than the restructured creditors , it could trigger more litigation			1
but as mr @entity128 noted : " the ' most favoured lender provision ' of the new bonds expires on december 31 2014			0
from january 1 2015 , @entity7 can settle with the holdouts without any obligation to pay additional amounts to the exchange bondholders			1

president @entity80 has said @entity7 would keep paying " as befits a country which has recovered its self - esteem "
@entity6 judge has ordered @entity7 to make the escrow payment as it is due to pay over $ 3bn in restructured debt
