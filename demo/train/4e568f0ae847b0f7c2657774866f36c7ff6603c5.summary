-- @entity2 's career will be defined by @entity3 , even if the @entity4 ca n't give boxing the fight it has long been clamoring to see			1
that 's the view of @entity9 's boxing correspondent , @entity8			1
he says he is optimistic that @entity2 and @entity3 can finally reach a deal to settle who is the best pound - for - pound fighter in the sport			1
@entity2 's next fight is in may next year while @entity3 is due in court next month to answer charges of domestic violence			1
should he retain his liberty , @entity8 thinks a showdown in december 2011 is a possibility			0
and according to @entity8 , the danger for eight - division world champion @entity2 is that his legacy will be affected just as much by a failure to meet @entity3 in the ring than if the fight goes ahead			1
he told @entity0 : " if @entity2 gets through his next fight scheduled for may 7 and if @entity3 resolves his problems i think there is actually a good chance			1
i 'm as optimistic as i have been in long time for that fight to come off late in the year , maybe december			2
" but the truth is there are a lot of theories about @entity3 maybe waiting for @entity2 to be past his prime , like @entity39 did with @entity40 in the eighties			2
" @entity2 , i think he is a once in a generation type talent			2
i know there are people calling him greatest of all time and you always kind of rush to judge these things when you see someone so spectacular in their prime			0
" its really unprecedented what he is doing but i think we are probably going to have to wait until all is said and done until we really make judgments on his career			0
" one thing for sure though is if the @entity3 fight does n't happen he [ @entity2 ] might be defined just as much for not having that fight			1
" @entity2 , who is a congressman in the @entity4 , is due to announce who his next opponent will be at his 32nd birthday celebrations on friday with @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 in the frame			1
@entity8 explained : " there is @entity65 , the former @entity70 welterweight champion , @entity66 , the current @entity72 lightweight champion , and a dark horse candidate is @entity67 , the former @entity74 , who is undefeated but has not really fought anybody of note and has the lightest resume of the three			0
" [ @entity65 ] is the best known but at the same time he is also coming off two really bad performances			0
he lost 11 of 12 rounds against @entity3 in may and he had a very , very listless controversial draw [ with @entity82 ] in september			0
" he is 39 - years - old and he probably does n't deserve a shot against the pound - for - pound champion , but deserves seldom has anything to do with it in boxing			0
" @entity2 made history by becoming the first fighter to claim titles in eight weight divisions after his victory over @entity92 secured the vacant @entity94 super-welterweight belt			2
according to reports in the @entity4 , @entity2 is currently ironing out a query over his taxes arising from fights in 2009			0
he recently moved his next fight from april to may due to his political responsibilities in the country .			0
