-- protesters carried a @entity3 flag stained with fake blood in the country 's capital this week -- a symbol , they said , of president @entity9 's six - year term			1
just a few hours later , @entity3 television broadcast video of the outgoing president brushing his hand across a pristine flag as triumphant music played in the background			2
the images showed two drastically different interpretations of @entity9 's legacy : a fed - up public that has grown weary of a brutal drug war ; and a president who maintains that his fight against organized crime was necessary and , by some measures , successful			1
" i leave having accomplished my duty and responsibility to serve @entity3 , " said @entity9 , whose term ends this week			1
" i have worked to leave a stronger , healthier country , with a better justice system and a solid economy			0
" but activists offered a much harsher assessment , staging a protest in @entity34 dubbed " a @entity35 : a six - year term of death			1
" " @entity9 leaves as a traitor to the country , as the president of devastation and contempt , " the @entity39 said in a statement , slamming @entity9 's " clumsy attempt to reduce crime			1
" @entity3 's new leader to @entity0 : the key weapon in drug war @entity9 : we had to make ' difficult decisions ' in his farewell address , broadcast wednesday night , the president thanked the country 's public officials , military and police for " defending @entity3 families			1
" @entity9 noted that his government had passed universal health care and kept @entity3 's economy stable in the face of the global financial crisis			1
but he did not explicitly mention the controversial six - year crackdown on drug cartels that began in 2006 , when he deployed federal troops to fight organized crime			1
the battle became a hallmark of his tenure , and has sparked mounting criticism in recent years			0
government statistics estimate that 47,500 people have died in drug - related violence since @entity9 took office			2
more : how the drug war started the @entity3 government has not released official figures since january , and others estimate a much higher death toll			2
officials have repeatedly said that brutal battles between rival cartels fueled the violence			0
and in earlier speeches , @entity9 has noted that 25 of the country 's 37 most - wanted drug traffickers were killed or captured during his tenure			1
" thanks to all @entity3 for your understanding before the very difficult decisions that we had to make in order to face so many complicated challenges , " @entity9 said in his address			1
" beyond my capabilities and limitations , i assure you that i have put all my willingness and understanding to work toward the common good of @entity3			2
" a recent national survey by the @entity3 firm @entity100 ( @entity101 ) revealed that nearly 66 % of @entity3 questioned believe that drug traffickers were winning the organized crime fight			0
in that same survey , 52 % of the 2,000 - person sample questioned said they approved of @entity9 's approach to combating cartels			1
analysts offer different assessments of whether @entity9 's drug war strategy worked			2
some have argued that the president entered the battle without realizing the enemy 's capabilities			0
" i think the adversary was larger and more harmful than we thought , " security expert @entity117 told @entity0 en @entity118 in 2010			0
" it was much more capable of responding to the government 's strategy , and getting stronger			0
" others have said @entity9 had no choice but to move forward			0
" when @entity9 came to power , it was already going on			0
the only option was to use the army and the federal police			0
if he had n't done it ... in no time you would have organized crime controlling the country , " @entity131 , who studies security at @entity3 's @entity133 in @entity134 , said last year			1
" if he had waited until the army and police were prepared , @entity3 would have more kidnappings , more extortion			0
he had no other option			0
it was a bad option , but the others were worse			0
" defiant former @entity3 mayor assassinated but critics , like the peace movement that protested wednesday , have said @entity9 's administration has n't done enough to help the drug war 's victims			1
and activists have accused his government of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses committed by police and troops fighting the drug war			0
in his september state of the union address , @entity9 defended his approach , and said abuses by authorities combating cartels were the exception , not the rule			0
" and far from hiding them , " he said , " in all the cases that were brought to light , action was taken against those responsible			0
" this week , in his home state of @entity172 , where @entity9 first announced his crackdown on cartels , banners with farewell messages addressed to him hung from prominent bridges			2
they were purportedly signed by the @entity178 , a splinter cartel that surged in the state last year			0
@entity9 heads to @entity180 president - elect @entity181 , who takes office saturday , has said he plans to take a different approach , focusing on reducing violence			1
he has offered few specifics about how his security policies will differ from @entity9 's strategy , but he 's said that change is coming			2
" we will keep the policies that i think work , " @entity181 said this week , " including cooperation with the @entity193 to effectively fight organized crime			0
" as @entity181 prepared to take the reins this week , @entity3 learned the answer to a question that has been the subject of much speculation : where will @entity9 go , now that his term is ending ? @entity180 's @entity201 announced wednesday that the outgoing @entity3 president will spend the next year as a global public leaders fellow at the school			1
" president @entity9 is a vivid example of a dynamic and committed public servant , who took on major challenges in @entity3 , " @entity205 , the school 's dean , said in a statement			1
hours after the announcement , a @entity3 researcher who is studying ethics and corruption at @entity180 this year said university officials should reconsider the move			1
" i am alarmed that @entity180 will protect a person as unethical as @entity9 , " @entity219 wrote in a @entity221 post			2
@entity223 , who is a fellow this year at @entity180 's @entity224 and also heads a corruption and transparency research laboratory at @entity3 's @entity227 , said she was hoping others at @entity180 would join her in protesting @entity9 's appointment			1
the outgoing president , she told @entity0 , does not deserve the one - year fellowship			1
" he is handing over a country in flames , " she said			0
at the end of the video released by the @entity3 president 's office wednesday , @entity9 strides down the steps of his official residence			1
" as a citizen i will continue serving the country passionately until the end of my days , always grateful for the privilege i have been given to be @entity3			2
many thanks , and see you soon , @entity3 , " the president says			2
he looks up toward a flag , fluttering in the sky			0
