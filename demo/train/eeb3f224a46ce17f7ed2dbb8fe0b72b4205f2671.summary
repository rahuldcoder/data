a tiger swims in a pond to cool off on a hot saturday morning			2
school children stroll under a canopy of trees and watch @entity6 gibbons playfully swing on the branches			2
all seems fine at the @entity8 , @entity10 's oldest zoo and once its most impressive			1
but a closer look reveals the sad state it has fallen into			0
out of the public 's sight , tigers are kept in small , dark cages			1
there is little room outside for all of its 15 tigers to roam , so only one is let out at a time			0
a @entity22 tiger " @entity25 " is so sick she can not keep any food down			0
a few cages away is another emaciated white tiger " @entity28			0
" " see , these tigers never go out their whole life , they 're very skinny tigers , " said experienced zookeeper @entity29			1
@entity29 was brought in by the @entity10 government to lead a temporary team to improve conditions when it took over the privately run zoo in 2010			1
he now spends two days a week trying to teach zoo staff how to care for animals kept in cramped and unsanitary living conditions for far too long			1
before @entity29 arrived , about 25 of the zoo 's 4,000 animals died each month , many of them prematurely , from disease and neglect			1
among them was a cheetah , a gift from @entity50 's president , whose leg was bitten off by a tiger and later died			1
@entity29 says trained zookeepers would never put cheetahs and tigers together			0
" i think this is the only zoo i heard where a cheetah fights with the tigers , in this zoo , because they never meet in the wild , " he explained			0
there has been some progress since his temporary team came in			0
now , an average of 15 of the zoo 's animals dies each month			1
in march , the zoo 's last remaining giraffe was one of them			1
an autopsy revealed that the adult male had eaten a staggering amount of plastic ; around 18 kilograms or 40 pounds was found in its abdomen , mostly food wrappers			0
according to @entity29 , it is not the only animals to have ingested trash that ends up in the enclosures			1
poor sanitation and uncontrolled breeding also remain serious challenges for the zoo			1
a pelican nurses her chick in a pen it shares with about 160 other pelicans			0
there is so little room , the birds can barely stand and unfurl their wings			0
several primates and birds are kept @entity97 in what was once the zoo 's quarantine area			2
a brightly - coloured macaw no longer has any feathers on its breast			0
it has become so stressed by living in captivity that it has plucked them all out , @entity104 says			1
@entity113 , the head of the @entity114 , who works with @entity115 , told @entity116 , " this overpopulation has been going on for so long , there 's inbreeding and for sure this wo n't be a good thing for the @entity8			1
" the biggest problem @entity29 says is the lack of understanding of animal welfare and conservation			1
he is slowly training the zoo 's 70 keepers but faces resistance from some who have worked in the zoo for years , even decades			1
a baby elephant pulls against the chains secured around its legs as it moves around a cramped , concrete cell			0
one of the keepers tells sumampau the chains are used to train the young elephant to walk			0
frequent changes in management and infighting are to be blamed for the zoo 's appalling state , according to the team			2
@entity29 appointed one of the zoo 's staff , @entity144 , as the new curator			2
she says she was reluctant to take on the position but is heartened by the changes			0
" our zoo is old " , she said			0
" it will take time to modernize it , however , some of visitors notice the changes because some of the cages are getting fixed already			0
" enclosures for the komodo dragons , endangered and found only in @entity10 , have been renovated and the younger lizards are now kept separate from the adults who can prey on them			1
the barriers are low and properly installed for visitors to safely watch the @entity163 dragons sunbathe			0
" if you can set up exhibits showing the animals ' normal behavior so people will see and know about tiger behavior , elephant behavior and things like that , the zoo in fact is education for the visitor , " @entity29 said			2
rebuilding the zoo will require expertise and money			0
however , with tickets priced at less than $ 2 each , revenues are just enough to feed the animals and keep the zoo running			2
@entity29 and his team have proposed plans to modernize the zoo , but stakeholders , including @entity8 's local government and the @entity189 , have yet to agree on a scheme and appoint a management team			1
the @entity189 wants the @entity8 local government to appoint a third - party team of professionals to run the zoo			1
the @entity197 administration prefers a body owned by municipality to take over			0
" we will support whoever , professionals , chosen by the local government to run the zoo , " @entity113 said			2
" our duty here is temporary and it is to save the animals , rescue them and prepare for the eventual transfer to the next management			2
" " we need everyone to have the same vision to fulfill animal welfare of the zoo animals , that 's the most important thing " , stressed @entity29			1
" the surplus animals have to be out , or euthanized , whichever is better , or some can be released to the wild			2
this has to be done and then we need funding to rebuild the zoo completely			0

years of neglect are evident in *mortality* rates at @entity10 's @entity8
until the government *stepped* in two years ago , 25 animals were dying each month
conditions have improved but *overcrowding* , poor sanitation and inbreeding remain problems
zookeeper @entity104 is trying to change attitudes , improve animal welfare
