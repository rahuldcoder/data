@entity0 -- young illegal immigrants can start applying on august 15 for two - year deferrals from deportation , but will have to pay $ 465 in fees , a top immigration official announced friday			1
the announcement provided the first details of the @entity11 administration 's policy change announced june 15 that provides some illegal immigrants who came to the @entity13 as children a path to an employment authorization card without fear of getting deported			1
under the new policy , people younger than 30 who came to the @entity13 before the age of 16 , pose no criminal or security threat , and were successful students or served in the military can get a two - year deferral from deportation as well as an employment authorization card			1
participants must be able to prove they have lived continuously in the @entity13 since june 15 , 2007 -- five years before the change was announced -- and must have entered the country without inspection or had their lawful immigration status expire			2
young immigrants prepare for new @entity13 deportation policy @entity35 , director of the @entity36 , said the application process will include providing biometric information and undergoing a background check			1
applicants who commit fraud in the application process , pose a security threat or have been convicted of serious crimes will be ineligible and subject to prosecution , he said			0
in all other cases , according to @entity35 , information submitted in the application process will not be used for immigration enforcement			1
a senior administration official told reporters on background that the goal is to maximize participation by eligible young illegal immigrants , so a strong privacy policy is important			1
other details announced friday made clear that while successful applicants would avoid deportation for two years , there is no mechanism involved that would speed up or ease their path to full citizenship			0
conservative critics of the new policy said it amounted to a " backdoor " amnesty by the @entity11 administration to appease @entity71 supporters angered by the lack of comprehensive immigration reform since the president took office			0
the policy change was in essence an administrative step to mimic some provisions of the @entity80 backed by @entity11 and @entity81 that was blocked by republicans in @entity83			2
opinion : @entity85 gets real on immigration in announcing the change on june 15 , @entity11 said it will make immigration policy " more fair , more efficient and more just			0
" noting children of illegal immigrants " study in our schools , play in our neighborhoods , befriend our kids , pledge allegiance to our flag , " @entity11 said that " it makes no sense to expel talented young people who are , for all intents and purposes , @entity13			1
" however , @entity11 and other administration officials said @entity83 still needs to pass the @entity80 and tackle immigration reform because the policy change in june was designed to address an immediate need , rather than be a permanent solution			2
the change was part of a @entity113 effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a serious threat , such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now , officials say			2
by halting deportations of younger immigrants who pose no threat , the department hopes to unclog a backlog of 300,000 immigration cases			0
in addition , the election - year move was widely praised by @entity71 - @entity13 leaders , many of whom previously criticized @entity11 for an overall increase in deportations of illegal aliens since he took office			1
in 2011 , @entity135 removed 396,906 illegal immigrants , the largest number in the agency 's history			0
the @entity71 - @entity13 vote is vital to @entity11 's chances for winning re-election in november			0
in the conference call friday with reporters , the senior administration official said the fees charged for applications are intended to cover the cost of implementing the policy change			0
no general fee waiver exists , but an exemption may be granted in exceptional cases , such as homelessness or disabilities , the official said			0
the official also warned people that applications will only be accepted starting august 15 , and warned that anyone who offers to expedite the process or start it earlier would be unauthorized and likely running a scam			1
