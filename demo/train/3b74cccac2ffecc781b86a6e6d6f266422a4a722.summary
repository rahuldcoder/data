@entity0 -- two men suspected of planning an attack on a @entity5 synagogue with guns and a grenade were arrested wednesday , marking the end of a seven - month undercover operation by @entity0 police officers			1
the suspects , @entity12 and @entity12 , were detained in @entity5 after buying two loaded @entity14 semi-automatic pistols , one @entity16 revolver , ammunition and a grenade , according to police commissioner @entity19			1
at least a dozen police officers swarmed @entity21 , who was at the time placing the weapons in the trunk of his car			1
@entity26 was arrested on a street nearby moments later			2
each faces terrorism and hate - crime - related charges and , if convicted , could confront the prospect of life behind bars without the possibility of parole			1
@entity21 , a 26 - year - old unemployed resident of @entity37 , is a native of @entity38 who traveled to the @entity39 in 1995 , claiming asylum			1
" muslims are abused all over the world , and i ai n't going to take it , " prosecutors quoted @entity21 as saying ; his conversations with an undercover police officer were secretly recorded			1
prosecutors say @entity21 sold narcotics in an effort to finance the planned attacks			1
his defense attorney , @entity51 , told @entity53 judge @entity52 that his client " has n't committed any crime at all			2
" @entity26 , 20 , also a @entity37 resident , was previously arrested on a pending 2010 burglary charge			0
he worked for a local delivery service and came to the @entity39 in 1999 with his family from @entity60 , @entity61			0
defense attorney @entity62 -- while not acknowledging the legitimacy of the charges -- asked for leniency given that the prosecutors ' case appeared to hinge more directly on @entity21 , he said			0
both men 's voices were captured on audio recordings plotting the attacks , district attorney @entity72 said , but they had not selected which synagogue to target			0
neither man has been charged in connection with a terrorist cell			0
both , however , were allegedly " committed to violent jihad , " telling police that they wanted to kill @entity79 people and also hoped to attack @entity0 's @entity80 , @entity72 said			1
" while @entity85 is dead , terrorism around the world is not , " mayor @entity82 said thursday			1
such " lone wolves " are " the toughest to stop , " the mayor said , noting that 12 other terrorist plots in @entity0 have been thwarted since september 11 , 2001			1
" we know that , as an international symbol of freedom and liberty , @entity0 is and will always be a target			0
" authorities said the suspects discussed disguising themselves as @entity79 temple - goers , growing their beards and pretending to pray as a way to sneak inside a synagogue and place a bomb			1
during the course of the police investigation , @entity21 was recorded discussing his goal of financing " the @entity108 cause in @entity103 " and traveling to @entity103 in an effort to kill @entity106 soldiers , according to a district attorney statement			1
the suspects offered no resistance during the arrest , and the plot appears to be more aspirational than operational , police said			1
they were arraigned thursday in @entity53			0
" generally the federal government has a greater interest in prosecuting these matters , " said former federal prosecutor @entity114			0
" their deferral here begs the question of the posturing and the behind - the - scenes politics that played out			2
" @entity114 called it a " major accomplishment " for the state to try a terrorist suspect , rather than to proceed under federal jurisdiction			2
over the course of the investigation , prosecutors say , @entity21 discussed buying multiple guns while trying to learn how to build a bomb			2
he allegedly proposed blowing up an empty synagogue , as well as a church in @entity37			0
later , @entity21 was recorded discussing ideas of blowing up a synagogue " with @entity79 or @entity139 inside , " the statement said			0
" the defendants plotted and took concrete steps to bomb synagogues and kill @entity79 @entity0 as an act of terrorism , " @entity72 said			0
meanwhile , @entity39 @entity146 officials continue to stress that lone wolves and homegrown terrorists are high on their list of concerns and can be just as dangerous as those with direct ties to @entity153 or other extremist groups			1
the terror threat " was on the radar screen " well before @entity153 leader @entity85 was killed may 2 in @entity159 , one law enforcement source said			0
the arrests grew out of another investigation that also began long before @entity85 's death , officials said			2
@entity164 president and ceo @entity165 released a statement thursday saying his group was " disturbed by the news reports of a homegrown terror plot aimed at @entity79 communal institutions in @entity0			2
" in the wake of @entity85 's death , he says , the federation is endeavoring to help " communities be prepared , alert and secure against the heightened threat			0
" @entity1 's @entity176 and @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
