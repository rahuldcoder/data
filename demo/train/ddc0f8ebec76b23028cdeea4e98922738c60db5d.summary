@entity0 -- nearly 180 @entity3 weapons were lost -- some falling into the hands of criminals -- after officers left them in restrooms , vehicles and other public places , according to an inspector general report			1
the officers , with @entity18 and @entity19 and @entity20 , " did not always sufficiently safeguard their firearms and , as a result , lost a significant number of firearms " between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2008 , the report said			1
in all , 243 firearms were lost in both agencies during that period , according to the january report from inspector general @entity25			1
of those , 36 were lost because of circumstances beyond officers ' control -- for instance , @entity20 lost a firearm during an assault on an officer			2
another 28 were lost even though officers had stored them in lockboxes or safes			0
but 74 percent , or 179 guns , were lost " because officers did not properly secure them , " the report said			1
following a review of the draft report in december , @entity3 took steps to implement its recommendations and overhaul its property management policy , according to a response in the report			1
a department spokeswoman did not immediately return a call from @entity1 thursday seeking comment			0
the report concluded the department did not have specific procedures and policies in place regarding firearms			0
" instead , @entity3 relied on its components to augment its general property management policies and procedures with specific guidance for safeguarding and controlling firearms , " it said			1
" although some component policies and procedures for safeguarding firearms were sufficient , personnel did not always follow them			0
" the inspector general cited several examples of " inappropriate practices			0
" a customs officer , for instance , left a firearm in an idling vehicle in the parking lot of a convenience store			0
the vehicle was stolen while the officer was inside			0
" a local law enforcement officer later recovered the firearm from a suspected gang member and drug smuggler , " the report said			0
in addition , an @entity20 officer left an m - 4 rifle and a shotgun unsecured in a closet at his home			2
both weapons were stolen in a burglary and later recovered from a felon , according to the report			0
another officer left his firearm in the restroom of a fast - food restaurant , and it was gone when he returned			2
" other @entity96 and @entity20 officers left firearms in places such as a fast food restaurant parking lot , a bowling alley and a clothing store , " the report said			1
" although our review focused on @entity96 and @entity20 , other components described similar incidents			0
for example , a @entity106 officer left a firearm in a lunch box on the front seat of an unlocked vehicle ; the officer realized the firearm was stolen when he returned to the vehicle two days later , " said the report			2
" officers may have prevented many of these losses had they exercised reasonable care when storing their weapons			0
" of the 179 lost because of laxity , 120 were reported stolen and 59 as lost , the report said			1
that resulted from the agencies ' lack of guidance on a standard method for classifying and reporting lost firearms , as well as " a common perception among officers that reporting a stolen firearm was more acceptable than reporting a lost firearm			2
" although @entity96 and @entity20 reported 120 firearms as stolen , our analysis showed that these firearms were lost ( stolen ) because officers left the firearms unsecured , " according to the report			1
" all 179 losses may have been prevented had the officers properly secured their firearms			1
" the department had about 188,500 weapons in its inventory as of last summer , the report said			0
the majority are assigned to @entity96 and @entity20 officers , but others are carried by agencies including the @entity147 , the @entity148 and the @entity149 .			1
