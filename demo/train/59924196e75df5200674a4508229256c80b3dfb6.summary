six @entity5 members now have left their jobs in the wake of the incident in @entity12 , @entity13 , which came while they were on a security detail in advance of president @entity18 's trip there for the @entity20			1
the agency also announced friday that a 12th @entity5 " employee has been implicated , " having previously said 11 were under investigation			1

in addition , the @entity30 military is investigating 11 of its own troops for possible heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes			1
a source close to the investigation said @entity5 director @entity37 -- who briefed @entity18 on the investigation friday , according to @entity40 officials -- has ordered a " comprehensive " investigation of everything that happened during the trip			1
that includes interviews with every @entity5 member on site , hotel staff and alleged prostitutes , the source said			2
in addition , the source confirmed that @entity5 agents were staying at a second hotel on the trip -- identified as a @entity55 in @entity12 -- which presumably will be included in the expanded probe			1
the controversy has embarrassed the nearly 150 - year - old agency that protects the president and other top officials and investigates criminal activity			2
it also raised questions about a possible security breach immediately preceding @entity18 's visit , though @entity68 chairman rep. @entity67 has said that " from everything we know , nothing was compromised			2
" @entity5 pushing out three members amid @entity13 scandal two of the @entity5 employees whose departures were previously announced -- identified as @entity77 and @entity78 , a source familiar with the investigation told @entity1 national security contributor @entity81 -- were supervisors			1
in a photo posted on his public @entity87 page in january 2009 , @entity84 is seen standing behind @entity89 , wearing dark glasses and what appears be a wedding ring			0
under the photo , @entity84 posted a comment that said , " i was really checking her out , if you know what i mean ? " that remark drew a strong response thursday night from @entity89 , who was a vice presidential candidate when the photo was taken			0
" this agent who was kind of ridiculous there in posting pictures and comments about checking someone out , " @entity89 said on @entity99			0
" check this out , bodyguard			0
you 're fired ! and i hope his wife sends him to the doghouse			0
" @entity84 , a son of a @entity5 agent , has been employed with the agency since 1987 , according to his posting on @entity115			1
the posting notes that he is married , has an adopted son and his assignments included a stint protecting former vice president @entity120			0
questions raised about macho culture , women agents @entity78 supervised the canine training unit at the @entity5 's @entity125 outside @entity0 , according to @entity126 and a career development posting on the @entity129 's website			2
attorney @entity130 -- general counsel for the @entity131 , which represents @entity5 agents and others -- said he is not representing all of the agents involved in the @entity13 story , but he does have several other clients in the group in addition to @entity84 and @entity78			2
he would not comment on specifics of the investigation , but complained about leaks that publicly identified @entity84 and @entity78 and gave details of what allegedly happened in @entity13			0
" the concern i have is about illegal leaks coming from apparently rogue elements within the @entity5 of privacy - protected information , " @entity144 said			2
" it is distorting the review of what happened			0
" all the employees are accused of bringing prostitutes to @entity12 's @entity155 ahead of last week 's visit by @entity18			1
they 'd arrived earlier that morning as a part of the " jump team " that flies in on military transport planes with vehicles in the president 's motorcade , said @entity81			0
according to sources , the alleged prostitutes -- the youngest of whom were in their early 20s -- signed in at the hotel , where @entity5 members apparently stayed , flashing their local id cards			1
one of these women allegedly was later involved in a dispute about how much she was to be paid for the night , which brought the entire incident to light and sparked controversy in the @entity30 and @entity13			2
former @entity13 president @entity179 told @entity1 on thursday that the incident was due entirely to " a lack of ethics ( on the part of ) the @entity5 of the @entity30			1
" members of the @entity185 offered similarly biting remarks			0
@entity40 minority leader @entity187 called the allegations " disgusting , " while senate majority leader @entity189 described the agents ' alleged actions as " either really stupid or a total lack of common sense			0
" the @entity30 military is investigating six members of its elite @entity197 , or @entity197 , officials said			1
the @entity197 ' failure to make curfew the night of the incident involving the @entity5 agents led the military to start its investigation , a @entity30 official told @entity1			1
all the military personnel are being investigated for heavy drinking and use of prostitutes while in @entity13 as part of the support team for @entity18 's visit , the official said			2
they are not likely to redeploy until the matter is resolved , other military officials said			0
the military investigation could end with no action , administrative action such as a letter of reprimand or a recommendation to proceed with criminal charges , officials said			0
while soliciting prostitution is in most cases legal for adults in @entity13 , military law bars service members from patronizing prostitutes , engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer or , for enlisted personnel , conduct " prejudicial to good order and discipline			1
" it is also considered a breach of the @entity5 's conduct code , government sources said			0
@entity1 's @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 contributed to this report .			0
