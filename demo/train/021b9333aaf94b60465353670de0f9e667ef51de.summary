" this court concludes that @entity4 's right of publicity is outweighed by defendants ' @entity17 right to free expression , " judge @entity10 of the @entity11 said in an order monday			1
@entity4 -- who 's serving a prison sentence in @entity5 after being convicted of drug trafficking , money laundering and killing political opponents -- had argued that the 2012 video game " call of duty : @entity26 " damaged his reputation			1
creators of the video game called the lawsuit " frivolous " and " absurd			0
" they filed a motion to dismiss it , arguing that @entity4 's portrayal in the game is protected by the @entity33			1
" this ruling is an important victory and we thank the court for protecting free speech , " said former @entity35 mayor @entity34 , attorney for video game creator @entity36 " this was an absurd lawsuit from the very beginning and we 're gratified that in the end , a notorious criminal did n't win , " @entity34 said in a statement tuesday			2
" this is not just a win for the makers of ' @entity9 , ' but is a victory for works of art across the entertainment and publishing industries throughout the world			0
" @entity4 , 80 , filed the lawsuit in @entity11 in july , arguing that his portrayal " as a kidnapper , murderer and @entity62 " in the video game harmed his reputation			2

in a statement tuesday , @entity36 described the game as historical fiction and said @entity4 's lawsuit could have had far - reaching consequences if it had n't been thrown out			1
" in the unlikely event the lawsuit had been permitted to proceed , @entity4 's efforts could have provided numerous historical and political figures a veto right over their appearances in works of art , having a chilling effect on everything from movies like @entity123 and @entity124 , to television programs including @entity126 and @entity127 and even to popular books such as @entity129 , " the statement said			1
in court documents , @entity4 said he learned about the video game from his grandchildren , who told him that his image and likeness were being used			1
" @entity4 fails to provide any evidence of harm to his reputation , " @entity10 said in his ruling			1
" indeed , given the world - wide reporting of his actions in the 1980s and early 1990s , it is hard to imagine that any such evidence exists			0
