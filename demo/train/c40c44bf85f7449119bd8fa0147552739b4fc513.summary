as the @entity3 epidemic crept into @entity4 in march 2014 , a dramatic shift began to take place			1
in a matter of months , the widespread belief that @entity3 did n't even exist gave way to a gripping fear across @entity10 , the capital city			2
when the decision was made to evacuate @entity14 volunteers from @entity15 , @entity4 and @entity16 at the end of july , the agency worked quickly to ensure each volunteer returned safely to the @entity19			1
this was not an easy operation as logistics and already - challenged roads had deteriorated with the full force of the rainy season			2
once we , as @entity19 and @entity28 staff members , achieved our goal of seeing all volunteers safely back home , we began educating ourselves on the potential impact the ebola virus could have in @entity4			1
our primary concern was keeping each other and the communities where we lived safe			2
@entity10 's usual vibrancy became taut with fear as the epidemic spread			2
through an interagency partnership , @entity14 director @entity40 made the agency 's resources available to the @entity44 as they fought the @entity3 epidemic at the grassroots level			1
@entity14 staff who remained in @entity4 after the volunteers ' departure could help @entity44 experts build local support in the affected areas , bridge gaps in logistics and facilitate community entry in culturally appropriate ways			1
many of the @entity44 experts arriving to combat the epidemic had never set foot in @entity59 , so those of us in the @entity14 used our good standing in @entity64 communities to assist the @entity44 in getting prevention and treatment messages to the most effective stakeholders in each community			1
making a difference is a central tenant of @entity14 ' culture , so we felt this opportunity to support the @entity44 's effort was a perfect fit			1
the ability to pitch in and contribute not only empowered us , but we noticed it also helped dissolve the barriers of fear and revived the passion of the @entity14 staff			1
enthusiasm for the partnership was overwhelming			0
when staff members were given the option to use their time supporting the @entity44 , nearly all @entity14 @entity64 staff volunteered to help			1
starting in september , four - person teams -- composed of two @entity44 staff and two @entity14 staffers -- traveled across @entity4 to track the virus and teach people in rural and urban areas how to prevent transmission			1
it was a courageous decision and a serious commitment for each member of the @entity14 team			2
they put themselves closer to possible exposure , and they were going to live away from their families in @entity10 , where more than half of the new cases of @entity3 were reported			0
in the field , the teams faced many distressing moments			0
they witnessed a multitude of tragedies , such as when @entity3 - infected infants were set aside because protective materials were scarce			0
they mourned with those who suffered unspeakable losses			0
they stood by families who endured unimaginable heartbreak , but the @entity14 staff also had a significant positive impact			1
along with @entity44 experts , @entity14 staff went out to encouraged the sick to seek treatment rather than stay home to protect their families			1
these efforts kept people who had been in contact with @entity3 from infecting their families			0
it helped contain some of the contamination			0
@entity4 has made remarkable strides in the fight against @entity3 , and there are @entity64 heroes in every corner of the country			2
i happen to work with many in the @entity4 office			2
as everyday citizens , they stood up to fight this disease that had descended on their country			0
one @entity14 staff member convinced a mother to take her sick child to seek medical attention rather than caring for him at home			1
that one action potentially saved a household of 10 from @entity3			0
others made valiant efforts directing local health care workers toward the sick			0
@entity14 staff consoled the bereaved in the communities where they live			1
as they fight this epidemic , most @entity64 are incredibly grateful for the assistance of the global community , especially the @entity19			0
it is now common here for the sounds of @entity19 @entity164 helicopters and @entity165 buzzing overhead to be greeted as a sign of relief and support			0
the unfortunate reality is that after many years of hardship because of civil war , poverty and limited health care , @entity64 have developed an extraordinary ability to adapt to " the new normal , " and many have found a way to cope with @entity3 and move forward with their daily lives			0
the power of science and information from experts about how the virus can spread has allayed much of the fear and concern we saw many months ago			0
at this writing , all but two of @entity4 's 15 counties have been @entity3 free for the past 21 days			2
this is a huge accomplishment , but our mission is not over			0
there remains an intensive to - do list : concentrating resources in contact tracing , educating communities on safe burial practices and amplifying tactics to keep our health care professionals safe			2
@entity14 staff members have made -- and will continue to make -- an incredible impact in the fight against @entity3 in @entity4			1
stopping just one infection can deny the virus the ability to spread to 30 or more additional @entity3 exposures and potential deaths , and that means every conversation , every meeting , every hand washing station counts			0
our journey since march has , at different moments , been harrowing , exhausting and overwhelming , but every minute of it has been worth it			0
this effort has deepened our partnership with our colleagues at the @entity44 , but also with the @entity64 people and the communities @entity14 serves			1
it has strengthened our resolve and our commitment to bring @entity14 volunteers back to @entity4 and the other @entity3 - affected countries when it is safe to do so , and to continue to support the @entity44 and the @entity64 people , one community at a time			1
i could not have been more privileged and fortunate to work side by side with the @entity14 team in @entity4			1
i can only hope that i have made some small impact on their lives , as they have made a huge impact on mine .			0

even after @entity14 volunteers were evacuated from @entity4 , staff remained there
they *'ve* been working to get prevention and treatment messages out to communities
