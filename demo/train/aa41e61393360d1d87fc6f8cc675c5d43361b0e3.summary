-- @entity1 has confirmed he will not continue in his role as @entity5 's @entity4 captain after the weekend 's memorable win over the @entity7			1
@entity5 retained the prestigious trophy by beating @entity10 's team 14½ - 13½ at the @entity11 , despite having trailed by four points heading into sunday 's singles matches			1
but after helping @entity5 keep hold of the cup it won in 2010 , @entity14 's @entity1 believes it is time to for another captain to take charge			1
" first of all it is a lot of work , " the two - time major winner told a news conference			2
" it takes a lot from you you during the stretch of time from when you are named captain to the actual playing of the @entity4			2
@entity7 stunned by @entity5 fightback " on top of that there are a lot of players who should have the opportunity to be in my spot ... clearly i wo n't do it again			1
" @entity1 would be happy to offer advice to his successor , although he says he will also not force himself on the next incumbent -- with @entity44 @entity43 , a vice-captain in @entity45 , the early favorite to replace the @entity47			1
" the captain has to decide what he wants , " added the 46 - year - old @entity1			1
" if he wants to reach out to me , fine			0
but i 'm not going to be in there , i 'm going to be just on the side			0
" i think this is a one - time chance			2
i had my chance and now i will step back , try to concentrate on my game and leave the next captain to do his job			0
" did the @entity7 throw away the @entity4 ? @entity1 also revealed how @entity5 's triumph -- dubbed the " @entity59 " -- has prompted congratulatory messages from @entity14 royalty and the nation 's top sports stars			1
" @entity64 called me a few minutes ago and was pretty much over the moon , like me , " he said			2
" there have been messages from sports guys like [ tennis player @entity69 ] @entity70 and lots from friends and family			0
" @entity5 's challenge could have been derailed before it got off the ground when world no. 1 @entity76 arrived at the golf course late on sunday			1
the two - time major winner was confused over which time zone he was in			0
luckily for @entity1 , the @entity81 was driven to @entity82 by a state trooper and was able to win his match with @entity7 rookie @entity85			1
" obviously , we were a little concerned but we knew at 11:05 he was going to make it to the tee with no problems			0
that 's why i was not all that tense , " said @entity1			2
" luckily enough a police car was there and he made it on time			0
it was no surprise at all he managed to win his point			0
" @entity1 was also asked to select his highlight of the weekend , opting for @entity100 's fifth consecutive birdie on the 18th hole of saturday 's fourballs to give @entity5 a vital point			1
" it 's hard to just pick one but i think the putt @entity100 made on 18 on saturday afternoon was huge			0
we all knew how important that was			0
if that did n't happen i do n't think we 'd have had a chance to win			0

@entity1 will not continue as @entity5 's @entity4 captain
the @entity47 led @entity5 to a 14½ - 13½ victory over the @entity7 in @entity45
@entity43 , one of @entity1 's vice captains , is the early favorite for the role in 2014
@entity1 received a congratulatory phone call from the @entity64
