@entity0 , @entity1 -- delegates representing @entity5 and @entity6 nations and @entity7 coalesced behind the @entity9 rebels at a summit in @entity1 on wednesday , promising more humanitarian aid and money channeled through a temporary trust fund of sorts			1
members of what is called the @entity17 agreed that a temporary financial mechanism could provide a way to get money to the @entity9 opposition			1
@entity23 foreign minister @entity22 said participants in the @entity1 capital , @entity0 , were discussing the possibility of using frozen @entity9 assets for the fund			1
" i think this discussion about the trust fund is very interesting , " he told reporters			0
" and we will look into it because the frozen international money belongs , if it 's government money , to the people of @entity9			1
" @entity35 , deputy chairman of @entity9 's @entity36 , the country 's opposition body , said wednesday night that international delegates had agreed to make the funds available			1
@entity35 said more than $ 100 billion in regime funds would be unfrozen and made available to the opposition , though he did not say which country or countries would release the funds , or when			0
he also said rebels requested that @entity7 intensify its airstrikes and protection of the civilian population			2
the funding decision came amid a grim assessment of the humanitarian fallout from the @entity9 conflict and reports of mounting civilian casualties			1
@entity56 secretary - general ban ki - moon told the delegates that in a worst - case scenario , as many as 3.6 million strife - affected people could eventually require help , and that the money to provide that help has been slow in coming			1
so far the @entity56 has seen only 39 % of the $ 310 million it requested in emergency funding , " clearly insufficient given the prospective need , " @entity64 said			2
" it is critical that the international community act in concert , that we speak with one voice , and that we continue to work in common cause on behalf of the @entity9 people , " he said			1
the international delegates were meeting with @entity9 opposition leaders in an attempt to work out a peaceful end to the deadly impasse in the @entity6 nation			1
despite a @entity7 - led aerial campaign and rebels fighting on the ground , leader @entity80 has shown no signs of acquiescing			2
among the high - profile attendees in @entity0 is @entity80 's former intelligence chief and foreign minister , @entity89 , who fled to @entity90 last month			1
@entity35 said @entity89 was not invited to any of the meetings , however			0
" nobody from the @entity36 even considered meeting up with him , " @entity35 said			0
" it is our belief that @entity89 was seeking to get residency in @entity0 , or future residency			2
" rebel spokesman @entity99 had said the opposition was open to meeting with @entity89 if he first made clear , in writing , what he has to offer			2
the @entity9 @entity17 was formed after a @entity104 conference on @entity9 last month			2
the first meeting in @entity0 comes as civilian casualties continued to mount			1
the besieged western city of @entity108 has been especially vulnerable			0
@entity80 's tanks have been pounding the city , where several more people were killed wednesday , @entity99 said			0
tuesday , a doctor told @entity2 , at least 10 people were killed and 30 were wounded			0
@entity115 secretary of state @entity114 said wednesday that @entity80 's forces have reportedly destroyed crucial food supply warehouses in @entity108 and cut off water and power to the city " in an apparent attempt to starve ( residents ) into submission			0
" snipers have targeted @entity108 residents seeking medical attention , she said			0
a military official said on state - run television that @entity7 " airstrikes hit @entity108 's main road of @entity131 , resulting in civilian casualties			1
" the official said the towns of @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 were also hit by " the colonial crusader enemy			0
" @entity115 fighter jets have continued to fly bombing missions in the @entity7 - led campaign , @entity140 spokesman col. @entity139 said wednesday , although @entity115 officials had previously indicated in public comments that the @entity115 mission had become limited to providing support , including refueling and electronic jamming			0
@entity139 said the @entity115 aircraft assigned to @entity7 are ordered to defend the pilots who are enforcing the no - fly zone , and nothing more			0
@entity7 , he said , must still request @entity115 strike aircraft should they want them for offensive operations			0
@entity90 foreign secretary @entity158 and @entity160 foreign minister @entity159 both called tuesday for @entity7 to get more aggressive with the airstrikes in @entity9 , and opposition members urged the international community to implement the @entity165 resolution that calls for " all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack			1
" @entity9 @entity36 member @entity170 said the rebels should be supported with military supplies			1
he said the @entity9 people ought to have the right to defend themselves			1
@entity35 said the opposition has submitted a wish list of military equipment to @entity1 and @entity160			0
he said the list was compiled by rebel military leaders , but he did n't know exactly what was being requested			0
" i do n't think there 's going to be a problem in getting military equipment in , " @entity35 said			0
@entity1 prime minister @entity184 , a co-chair of wednesday 's meeting , said the opposition 's international allies will consider the needs			2
" of course we will look at it and make things available for the @entity9 people to defend themselves , " he said			1
@entity9 deputy foreign minister @entity192 accused @entity1 late wednesday of providing rebels in eastern @entity9 with @entity195 anti-tank warheads , but he did not say when			1
there was no immediate response from the @entity1 government			0
a week ago , a @entity2 team in eastern @entity9 saw the rebels with @entity195 anti-tank missiles , which they did n't have before			1
fighters said they obtained the missiles from the transitional government in @entity205 but did n't know where they came from			0
@entity207 , the multinational missile manufacturer that makes the @entity195 missile , says it is in service in 43 countries around the world			0
it does not list those countries , but the military analysis site @entity215 says the @entity195 missiles are used by the @entity1 armed forces			0
" the message to @entity80 is clear , " the @entity1 prime minister said			0
" he should use his head and those who are around him should advise him that it is in the interest of @entity9 , and if he is interested in @entity9 , then he should relinquish power and leave the @entity9 people to decide their own destiny			2
" @entity158 said arming the rebels would not necessarily mean violating an arms embargo imposed on @entity9			1
" we understand the resolutions to mean the arms embargo applies to the whole of @entity9 , but that in certain circumstances it is possible , consistent with those resolutions , to provide people with the means to defend the civilian population , " he said			1
the @entity0 meeting follows an effort earlier this week by the @entity240 to forge a peace plan that had been accepted in principle by @entity80			1
@entity35 and fellow rebel leader @entity243 rejected it on grounds that it did not provide any solutions to violence against the @entity9 people			2
meanwhile in @entity23 , the foreign ministry said it had summoned the @entity9 ambassador to inform him of the expulsion of five @entity9 diplomats			2
they will have to leave @entity23 within seven days because of accusations that they intimidated @entity9 citizens in @entity23			2
@entity2 's @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258 contributed to this report			0
