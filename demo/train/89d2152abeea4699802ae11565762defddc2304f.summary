-- @entity19 , big sigh of relief among @entity8 's super-rich , as the @entity1 announces " smart sanctions " against a group of @entity5 officials and members of @entity8 parliament in response to the referendum that took place in @entity12 and produced a result resembling the elections in the old @entity15 : 96.7 % of the people who took part in it voted for the peninsula to become part of @entity8			1
the joke on the streets of @entity27 is that the politicians took the bullet for the oligarchs , not for the first time and not the last			0
but jokes aside , the fate of @entity12 is sealed			0
it will become part of @entity8 in about three months ' time and , as things stand now , president @entity34 has already signed an executive order recognizing the peninsula as an independent state , confirming his determination to stick to his guns in his address to the @entity44			1
the @entity8 leader has gone way too far in his attempt to prevent @entity12 -- with two thirds of its population made up of ethnic @entity8 -- from sliding into mayhem to pull back now , sanctions or no sanctions			1
it would have been political suicide for him to remain idle in the face of what had happened in @entity57 last month			0
most @entity59 leaders obviously understood that , even though their rhetoric did not show it			0
in fact , most if not all @entity59 leaders are probably thanking their lucky stars they have to deal with mr @entity34 in the @entity5 and not some die - hard nationalist who would be dreaming of a revival of the former @entity15 empire , flexing military muscles with frightening regularity			0
no - one wants @entity72 so , the so - called " smart sanctions , " which have been announced by @entity80 and @entity81 in response to events in @entity12 were an anti-climax and a confirmation of a total lack of any desire on the part of the @entity1 to take the fight with @entity8 any further			1
sure , a bit of posturing and tough talking never hurt the opinion polls at home , but there are more important things than dragging out the dust covered @entity72 from the cupboard and losing out on business deals , while having all that lovely @entity8 money flowing to the @entity1 dry up			2
the @entity72 is very 1960s , you know , and no one really wants it to come back			0
the debate about the legality of the referendum in @entity12 will ramble on for a while but it is very difficult to imagine how the result can now be reversed			2
from the @entity8 side of the fence , in case you 're wondering , the plebiscite in @entity12 was a logical response to the overthrow of the democratically elected regime of president @entity110 in @entity57 -- albeit with its incompetence and corruption -- and the country finding itself with a bunch of opportunists in charge and some pretty rough characters from the far - right acting as their enforcers , saying nasty things about @entity8 from the word go			1
no wonder then that @entity27 shrugged all accusations that the @entity12 referendum was illegal coming from @entity57 and the @entity1 , saying : " look who 's talking ! " at the moment , all the @entity5 officials and members of parliament mentioned in the lists provided by @entity80 and @entity81 are putting on a brave face and saying that they see it as a privilege and an honor to be in them , pointing out that they do n't keep any money or own any assets abroad			1
not in their own names they do n't , because about a year ago a law had been passed in @entity8 that no governments officials and members of parliament were allowed to have foreign accounts and own properties abroad			2
so a transformation of ownership had taken place and it would be pretty hard to figure out who owns what and where			0
and in case anyone is wondering how then politicians and the servants of the people generally keep their wealth hidden , be it in @entity8 or in the @entity1 , it 's all about trusted people , " fixers , " handling it for them			1
yes , yes , do n't look surprised , democracy , both regulated and without boundaries , has its own well - tested system			0
otherwise why would people go into politics at all ? getting personal privately some @entity8 officials are saying that all these lists represent a break with the old tradition of not getting personal during a row			2
" no one called for smart sanctions against specific yanks and @entity174 when they pulled off that invasion of @entity177 , " one angry official in @entity27 complained to me			0
" and no one was naming names when the war in @entity181 went all wrong			0
" yes , getting personal in politics was always a taboo and this this round boundaries were crossed			0
so what now ? well , the noises will continue for a while , getting louder when @entity12 joins @entity8 proper			2
mind you , the situation may get more complicated if parts of eastern @entity192 start pushing hard for their on referendums on their future with @entity8 , like the one in @entity12			1
that is why it 's now a good time for both the @entity1 and @entity8 to start finding the way out of this crisis			1
read more : @entity34 vs. @entity202 face off over @entity12 facts the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

on *sunday* , 96.7 % of voters in @entity12 's referendum chose to leave @entity192 and join @entity8
the @entity211 and @entity212 *subsequently* imposed sanctions on some @entity8 , @entity192 officials
@entity206 says @entity34 has gone too far to pull back -- regardless of sanctions
he says it 's time for @entity8 and the @entity1 to start finding ways to *deescalate* the crisis
