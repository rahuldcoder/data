experts now think @entity2 -- or at least part of it -- survived its close encounter with the sun. @entity6 , a comet scientist for the @entity7 , said it is believed some parts of @entity2 's nucleus survived perihelion			1
" it now looks like some chunk of @entity2 's nucleus has indeed made it through the solar corona , and re-emerged , " he said			1
" it 's throwing off dust and ( probably ) gas , but we do n't know how long it can sustain that			0
" however , he said , its fate is uncertain			1
" now it has emerged and started to brighten , we need to observe it for a few days to get a feel for its behavior , " @entity6 said			0
@entity2 swept about 730,000 miles over the sun 's surface thursday about 2 p.m. et. a fleet of spacecraft watched @entity2 plunge toward the sun , including @entity36 's @entity35 satellite , the @entity39 / @entity36 @entity38 spacecraft and the @entity40			1
comets are giant snowballs of frozen gases , rock and dust that can be several miles in diameter			0
when they get near the sun , they warm up and spew some of the gas and dirt , creating tails that can stretch for thousands of miles			2
most comets are in the outer part of our solar system			2
when they get close enough for us to see , scientists study them for clues about how our solar system formed			0
astronomers @entity62 and @entity64 discovered @entity2 last year using a telescope near @entity66 , @entity67			1
@entity2 -- officially named @entity2 -- was 585 million miles away at the time			1
its amazing journey through the solar system had been chronicled by amateur astronomers and by space telescopes			0
" from the beginning , @entity2 has confused , surprised and amazed us , and in hindsight its latest little escapade really should not shock us , " @entity6 said			1
" nonetheless , this has been one of the most extraordinary comets we have ever encountered , and just goes to reiterate how beautiful , dynamic and exciting our universe is			0
" observers have been watching the comet for more than a year , hoping it would survive its sunbath and emerge to put on a sky show , visible to the naked eye in the @entity85			2
earlier thursday , @entity36 scientists had pretty much declared @entity2 dead at the end of a @entity88 to watch the comet swing by the sun. but professional and amateur astronomers were undeterred by the reports and kept analyzing @entity36 satellites			1
they found images that clearly show something emerging from the sun. " what we see here is the dust tail emerging first , pointing away from the sun , " said @entity97 with the @entity98 and a member of the @entity100			2
a video made by observing campaign member @entity107 shows the comet slicing toward the sun and then something -- apparently ison -- emerging from the other side			1
@entity107 is a fellow of the @entity111 at @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114			0
the discovery stunned many in the comet - watching community and led some to nickname ison the zombie comet			0
others repeated an old joke about comets and cats			0
" @entity126 are like cats ; they have tails , and they do precisely what they want , " @entity125 said			0
this comet also seems to have something else in common with cats -- nine lives			2
5 things to know about @entity2 2013 : the year of the comet ( we hope )			1

@entity2 -- or at least part of it -- may have survived , experts say
earlier reports indicated @entity2 *disintegrated*
the fate of the comet *remains* uncertain
it was making its closest approach to sun
