-- if the name @entity3 sounds familiar , it 's probably because you 've heard of her incredible feats of human performance -- before people like @entity8 and @entity9 became household names			1
meeting @entity3 , it 's instantly obvious there 's something different about her			1
by spending just five minutes with her -- or better yet , watching the 62 - year - old swim -- you 'll know you 're in the presence of an amazing athlete			1
on sunday , more than 30 years after her last competitive swim , she will once again take to the waters of the @entity22 to attempt the 103 - mile swim			1
it 's her fourth attempt to claim what she calls the " @entity26			1
" " i 'm feeling some pressure , " she said in an interview that aired friday			2
" i 'm feeling tremendous inner pressure that this has got to be it , this has got to be the last time			1
" on the other hand , i have to tell you , i am sky - high excited , " she said			2
" my adrenaline is just pumping out of my skin			2
" in the 1970s , @entity3 was unstoppable			1
in addition to winning multiple swimming marathons , she was one of the first women to encircle the island of @entity40 , and she holds the world 's record for longest ocean swim -- 102.5 miles from the island of @entity45 in the @entity46 to @entity47 , @entity48			1
but there was one goal that eluded her			2
@entity3 will continue chasing ' @entity51 ' " i 'm turning 60 , and i thought , ' what have i done with my life ? what have n't i done with my life , ' " she said two years ago			1
" i started thinking , ' you know what , @entity3 ? you 've got to get real with life 's lessons ; one of which is , you ca n't go back			1
' " but a chance sighting of her own face in the rear view mirror changed her outlook completely			2
" i caught my eyes , and i thought , ' wait a second			2
there 's one thing you actually can go back for ' -- and that 's the dream swim , which was @entity72 to @entity48			1
" her first attempt was in 1978			2
" i remember , i got down to the shore with my six handlers , " she said			2
" we 're looking out at a raging sea of whitecaps			2
" @entity3 said her navigator assured her that the seas calmed down almost to the serenity of a skating pond just a few miles out			1
unsure , she took his word for it and dove in			2
" if you 're on the @entity87 team that 's on the penultimate climb , and a storm comes in , you do n't say ' what the heck , we 're going anyway , " she said			1
" in this swim , we just said , ' what the heck , we 're going anyway			1
" forty - one hours and 49 minutes later , @entity3 's team pulled her out of the sea -- battered , delirious , ravaged by jellyfish , and only 50 miles from where she had started			1
that left her almost 60 miles from her intended landing spot			0
the sting of jellyfish , man - of - war and unfulfilled dreams last year , @entity3 twice met a similar fate			1
on her first attempt in august , an 11 - hour asthma attack and shoulder pain forced @entity3 out of the water about 29 hours into her swim			1
again in september , it was several stings from @entity114 box jellyfish that ended her quest			1
this sunday , for the third time in a year , @entity3 will take to the seas -- departing from @entity118 , @entity72 's , @entity119 on a quest to swim for the @entity48 shore			1
" i 'm ready for this , " she said this week			0
" we 've got the right team			0
we 've got a great weather window coming up , and i 'm just picturing that @entity48 shore and finally getting to those @entity127			0
" " i 've left no stone unturned in training , " she said two years ago			0
" i look at the weather , i look at my team , i look at shark devices , so i 'm ready			0
" speaking of sharks , @entity3 is attempting the swim without a physical shark cage , and she is relying on an electronic shark repellent device and a team of divers to keep them away			1
why does she continue to try ? " i would be lying if i said i 'd just been stewing over this for 30 years			0
i really have n't , " she said previously			0
" the issue here is n't as much about making that big athletic dream			0
really bigger than that is this existential grappling about being 60			0
" @entity3 's journey : in her own words she went on to paint a picture of those her age " back in the day " as old people -- wrinkled , shriveled up and discarded by society			1
" look at 60 - year - olds today			0
they 're not old , and i 'm not old , " she said previously			0
" i 'm not as fast as i used to be , i 'll admit that , " she said this week			0
" but i actually feel a little more powerful			0
i do n't feel as quick , but i feel more powerful			0
" and in terms of mind , i 'm just a calmer person , " she said			0
" i take things in stride			0
i used to get very angry if the weather did n't turn out the way i wanted it to ... i did n't think it was fair			0
i realize at this late stage in life that not everything is fair , and i accept things more readily			0
" " i 'm older than i was , yes , " she said two years ago			0
" i 'm slower than i was , but i 'm still vital and i 'm still powerful , and when i walk up on that shore in @entity48 , i want millions of those @entity169 sisters and brothers to look at me and say , ' i 'm going to go write that novel i thought it was too late to do			0
i 'm going to go work in @entity173 on that farm that those people need help at			0
i 'm going to adopt a child			0
it 's not too late , i can still live my dreams			2
' " @entity180 : @entity3 : @entity26			1

@entity3 calls the quest the " @entity26 "
" this has got to be the last time , " she says
@entity3 will begin the swim in @entity72 on sunday
