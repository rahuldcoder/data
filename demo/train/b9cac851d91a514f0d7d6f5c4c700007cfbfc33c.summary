-- @entity1 braced friday for another major snowstorm , just two weeks after a mammoth record - breaking blizzard buried much of the region			2
the peak of the storm is forecast for saturday night through midday sunday			1
it is not expected to be as strong as the blizzard , but the storm could still pack a powerful punch , with between 6 - 18 inches of snow expected in some places			1
interior portions of @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 will see the heaviest snow , while the major metro areas of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 are expecting rain			1
@entity22 is on the line between rain and snow			1
" i 've had enough			2
i 'm ready for spring , " said @entity27 , a resident of @entity28 , @entity13 , @entity0 affiliate @entity29 reported			1
the storm , combined with high winds , could lead to downed trees and power lines			1
it will likely disrupt travel on roads and create delays at airports , before heading out over the @entity39 on monday			2
" @entity22 will be ready , " said mayor @entity40			1
" we will be out treating the roads before the snow , and our plows are ready to hit the streets this weekend			1
" @entity47 tailgate the winter storm is separate from one that hit 20 states this week , pummeling baseball fans in @entity53 and dumping record snow in parts of @entity56			1
in spite of the snow , @entity58 fans showed up at @entity61 to camp out for their shot to buy individual tickets for @entity58 home games			1
tickets go on sale saturday			1
" had a little heat in there			0
covered up with three sleeping bags			0
i was good , " fan @entity69 told @entity0 affiliate @entity70			0
unlike some other tents , @entity69 's survived a blustery night			1
@entity72 showed a heavy snow falling , whipping plastic panels on tents set up outside the ballpark			1
a lone grill sat unused			0
some snow records @entity80 , @entity56 , saw its second - highest storm snowfall total on record with 14.2 inches over two days , the @entity79 said			1
some parts of the state saw even more snow , and @entity86 was not far behind , with accumulations of around a foot in some places			1
neighboring @entity90 got less snow than expected			2
the snow set a record at @entity94 with 9 inches falling in a single day			1
the old record was 5.1 inches set in 2010			2
the airport closed thursday evening but reopened overnight			0
some businesses and universities shut down thursday as state officials urged residents to stay off the roads			0

the incident was caught on camera and made its way to @entity0 affiliate @entity115			0
bus service resumed friday morning , and a handful of businesses reopened , @entity115 reported			0
silver lining while causing mayhem elsewhere , the snowstorm turned out to be a welcome one to many @entity122 and many others throughout the @entity124 who are suffering a drought			0
this is the third straight year of severe drought in the nation 's breadbasket -- affecting not just @entity56 , but also @entity90 , @entity131 , @entity86 and a host of other farm - heavy states			0
the @entity135 expects those conditions to continue into april , but near - record levels of snowfall will ease the problem and could accelerate the drought 's end			0
" it snows so infrequently here			0
now we 've been in a really bad drought for several years ; really , really hot summer and just no moisture			0
so we 're thrilled to see snow or ice -- whatever moisture we can get , " @entity80 resident @entity147 said			1
ranchers embraced the storm , even though bitter cold snowstorms can be deadly during calving season			2
@entity154 , a @entity56 rancher from @entity155 and the immediate past president of the @entity157 , said the storm did cause more work for him because he had to bring his calves inside throughout the day to warm them up			2
" the saving grace is the temperature			0
it 's not too cold tonight , so we should be in good shape , " @entity154 said , adding that he has n't lost any calves in the storm			2
he even called the snowstorm a blessing for bringing good moisture to the winter wheat			0
