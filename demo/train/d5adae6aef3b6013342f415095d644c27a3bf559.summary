-- @entity3 's book tour resembled the roll out of a new brand , and from my standpoint as a marketer , it looked like a big one handled badly			1
if , as many suspect , she is running for president in 2016 , she blew the perfect opportunity to present herself as the new @entity3			1
in her launch moment , she proved to be so inwardly focused on herself , she missed giving people the emotional release they 've been waiting for : to see what 's new with her and to be excited about the possibility of her being in the field again as a candidate			1
two cases in point ; her statement to @entity24 that the @entity25 were " dead broke " upon leaving the @entity26 and her interview with @entity28 suggesting that voters wo n't see her as part of the inequality problem and will gladly accept the @entity25 ' net worth of $ 100m + because they pay " ordinary income taxes			2
" this may just be too tone deaf and move her dangerously close to the edge of voter exasperation			1
@entity38 's big miss is that what could have been a moon shot moment for her brand ( that 's why they 're called " launches " and why advertisers spend millions on the @entity46 ) may fizzle into @entity48 fatigue			1
she is amazingly qualified but risks being a brand failure			0
there are several other indicators of a launch gone awry			0
book sales in the first week were only one sixth of what they were for her earlier , and very successful , memoir			2
commentators from across the spectrum have criticized her public appearances			2
a @entity65 poll released monday seems to show @entity38 's lead over @entity67 drooping in @entity68			1
today , her husband @entity38 even had to step in on her behalf , defending his wife 's response to a query about their wealth			1
but he had to acknowledge the missteps , noting hers was " not the most adept answer to a question			0
" evidence that this book tour needed to relaunch @entity38 can be found in a recent @entity82 / @entity81 survey : 55 % people rate her as competent , but 60 % do n't see her as likable and 62 % do n't regard her as trustworthy			1
that 's a perceptual trend among voters that has n't changed much since 2008			1
the book tour should have been planned to replace the old news about @entity3 , with new , inspiring ways to imagine she could lead			1
by contrast , one of the most successful impresarios of product launches , @entity90 , built them into spectacles			0
he protected the run - up to an announcement like a classified national security secret and then unleashed the event with maximum impact to create brand momentum for @entity102 over time			0
every launch was a new reason to be loyal to @entity102 , an even better argument for me to be in love			0
she , instead , leaves us frustrated with important questions unanswered : will she or wo n't she run ? does she have the fire ? does she have a vision for her candidacy ? why is she doing the tour now , so far ahead of 2016 ? how has she changed ? does she know that people often ca n't get underneath her thick crust ? who is she , anyway ? we watch her still back on her heels after all these years			2
it 's not just the trust and likability issues			2
it 's also calling out the woman - under - scrutiny card with @entity24 : " you know you 're being judged , " she said			0
well , some say , of course you 're being judged , that 's the point of all this ! it is @entity38 's inward focus that keeps her from connecting and understanding the world in terms other than hers : @entity38 has always been about her			1
her accomplishments , her slights , her victories			0
she has always had a hard time connecting her " her - ness " to us			0
that makes it very hard for her to establish why she 's relevant to our lives			0
she seems to refuse to deal with what voters most want to know : what 's in it for me ? maybe voters today like more the idea of what @entity38 represents , the first women presidential contender , than who she actually is			1
and her inability to connect with people could create an opening for someone else to come in and steal her thunder as the first woman presidential contender			1
@entity167 , anyone ? @entity169 professor and researcher @entity168 finds that leaders influence and persuade best when they connect to people first with warmth , followed with competency			1
@entity38 does n't fit into this paradigm at all : she leads with competency and , according to polls like the @entity82 / @entity81 survey , displays little apparent warmth			2
successful launches are all about timing and sustained impact			0
@entity38 should have kept the book tour bottled up until she was ready to declare for president because , down the road , we wo n't believe again that she 's coming out to us as new			1
consumers -- and competitors -- stick to this pattern and rarely give a brand in business a second chance to be new			0
a notable exception is @entity102 , which was veering dangerously close to bankruptcy in 1997 , its stock at a low of $ 6			0
in 2012 , @entity102 's stock price was over $ 700 ( before a recent 7 - for - 1 stock split ) and the company was stronger than ever , standing on the shoulders of many successful launches for the brand over the course of 15 years			0
there are examples of companies that have made old brands successful after numerous attempts that did n't succeed ( @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 )			0
but it 's hard to find a successful brand that came back after a really bad roll out , proving the point that if you blow it as a brand in a big product launch , you 're really at risk			0
as a brand , @entity38 will always be a rational purchase for voters , not an emotional one			1
like a functional @entity227 that gets you through the snow , is good on gas and always runs , @entity38 's brand has real value			1
but as she learned in 2008 , you have to explain to your friends why a functional @entity227 is better than a glamorous @entity235			0
the good news for @entity38 is that politics , unlike business , can be forgiving			2
after all , she is married to @entity38			2
even so , she has paid a price for the roll out : she seems less inevitable than two weeks ago .			0

@entity243 : @entity3 's book rollout has been criticized
she says it was an opportunity for her to *redefine* her image , connect with people
@entity243 says @entity38 's comments on wealth came across as tone deaf
she says @entity3 has to show that it 's not about her but about what she could offer voters
