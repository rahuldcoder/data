@entity0 -- ousted @entity3 prime minister @entity2 faces impeachment by the country 's @entity5 , following her indictment by an anti-corruption body the day after a top court removed her from office			1
members of the @entity14 unanimously decided to indict @entity2 for dereliction of duty over her government 's controversial rice subsidy scheme , @entity12 member @entity11 told reporters in @entity0 thursday			1
the @entity5 will now vote on whether to impeach her			0
asked how the 46 - year - old could be impeached when she had already been dismissed from the premiership , @entity11 said the case still needed to be reviewed by the @entity5 , as @entity2 could be banned from holding political office for five years if impeached			1
analysts had speculated that @entity2 's replacement as caretaker prime minister , @entity26 , may also be implicated in the affair , but @entity11 did not announce any measures against the new premier			1
an @entity12 committee was also considering whether to file criminal charges against @entity2 , but had not yet found sufficient evidence , he said			1
the program , introduced in 2011 , pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their rice , but has run into financial problems			0
critics say it has wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters , hurting exports and leaving the government with large stockpiles of rice it ca n't sell without losing money			0
@entity2 has previously said she was only in charge of developing policy around the scheme , not its day - to - day implementation , accusing the commission of unfair treatment			1

as tensions and rhetoric escalated thursday , officials confirmed a grenade had been thrown at the house of one of the @entity78 judges whose ruling wednesday forced @entity2 and nine cabinet ministers from office , in what her supporters see as a " judicial coup			1
" lt. gen. @entity84 , security advisor to the prime minister , said nobody was hurt in the early morning attack on the home of judge @entity89			1
" it landed on his garage , " he said			0
the court removed @entity2 , who was elected in 2011 and had been serving as caretaker prime minister until elections could be held , after finding her guilty of violating the country 's constitution for reassigning a senior security official in 2011			1
the official was replaced by the then national police chief , whose role in turn was given to @entity103 , a relative of @entity2			1
@entity104 is the brother of the ex-wife of @entity107 , @entity2 's brother who was overthrown as prime minister in a military coup in 2006 and has since lived in self - imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction			1
' polarization to intensify ' the dismissal of @entity2 , who has been replaced by deputy prime minister and commerce minister @entity26 , has deepened @entity3 's protracted political crisis , which has occasionally spilled over into deadly violence			1
analysts say the move has heightened the risk of clashes between opposing camps , and made near - term compromise solutions unlikely			2
" the @entity125 polarization is likely to deepen and intensify , " said @entity122 , political scientist at @entity123			2
" we are now looking at a political freefall ... much worse looks likely in the near term , before we can hope for improved circumstances in the longer term			2
" analyst @entity131 , director at @entity132 , a @entity0 - based risk assessment firm , said the court 's removal of an elected prime minister on what he described as " fairly weak " grounds was viewed by the government 's supporters as a case of politically motivated judicial overreach			2
" they consider it a way to usurp democratic elections , " he said			0
@entity2 is the third @entity107 - linked prime minister to be dismissed by the @entity78 , which also dissolved @entity107 's @entity148 political party in 2007 , raising suspicions among government supporters that the institution was biased against them			1
@entity122 said the appointment as caretaker prime minister of @entity26 , seen as closely affiliated to @entity2 and her brother , was poor judgment , especially when another deputy prime minister , @entity157 , would have been a more acceptable compromise candidate			1
" he lacks the stature and networks to see through an interim caretaker administration , " he said			0
" nevertheless , no matter who comes in as the new caretaker , the tensions will mount			2
" widening divide @entity3 's widening political divide pits anti-government , predominantly urban " yellow shirt " protesters against the pro-government , mainly rural and working class " red shirts			1
" the yellow shirts , drawn mainly from @entity0 's middle class , royalist establishment , allege that @entity2 is her brother 's puppet and seek to rid @entity3 politics of her family 's influence			1
led by the @entity182 ( @entity183 ) , they began their protests in november , outraged by her government 's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for the return of @entity107 to the political fray in earnest			2
@entity192 was then dissolved in december ahead of a february general election that was disrupted by anti-government protesters , and subsequently ruled invalid by the @entity78			0
the yellow shirts are seeking a new government -- but not through elections , which the opposition @entity198 has boycotted , arguing the alleged corruption of their political rivals makes widespread reform necessary before any meaningful vote can be held			2
" they claim the @entity107 clan as they call ( it ) is corrupt and has dominated the country 's politics , and the only way forward is to remove the @entity107 influence from politics and not have elections , " said @entity131			0
@entity183 leader @entity213 , a former deputy prime minister for the @entity198 , has instead called for power to be transferred to an unelected " people 's council			0
" but @entity131 said the opposition 's real motivation for avoiding elections was clear			0
" the @entity198 say ' no , we ca n't have elections , ' because they know they will lose those elections			0
" in contrast , the red shirt supporters of @entity2 and her brother , many of whom hail the north and northeast of the country , accuse the court of bias against their side			1
hundreds of protesters from the anti-government @entity183 gathered in @entity0 thursday as they have for six months , calling on supporters to join them for a mass rally friday to push for a new government			0
@entity183 spokesman @entity238 told @entity1 his movement did not recognize the legitimacy of the caretaker government			0
" currently there is no government to govern this country , so we must find a way to appoint a new government			0
" ' breaking point ' meanwhile , the red shirts are planning their own rally in @entity0 saturday to protest what @entity131 said they saw as " a judicial coup			0
" in the wake of the court 's ruling wednesday , supporters at the red shirts ' @entity0 headquarters were defiant			1
" this is the breaking point now , everything is leading up to the breaking point , " @entity260 , a @entity0 piano teacher and @entity2 supporter , told @entity1			2
" i would say @entity2 has died ( in ) her duty for democracy			2
" @entity266 , a red shirt leader , urged supporters to join saturday 's rally			0
" we wo n't give up until we win			0
" elections are scheduled for july 20 , but @entity122 said he believed it was " unlikely " that a vote would proceed in the wake of recent developments			0
" the @entity183 appears intent on pressing on for an appointment government of its preference , which can only galvanize red shirt protests , " he said			0
" a showdown is looming			0
