-- after the @entity4 's poor showing in the 2012 elections , many in the political world declared the movement dead			0
after all , it had lost one - sixth of its members in @entity10 and at least two @entity12 seats by running questionable candidates			0
plus , the tea party did n't get its way on the debt ceiling , and the @entity18 budget failed to get much traction			2
recent @entity0 polls , however , suggest that gaffes by the @entity23 administration are breathing new life into the tea party movement			1
in a @entity0 poll conducted in march , 28 % of the voting - age public supported the tea party			1
now , however , in the wake of the recent controversies involving the administration -- especially the one about the @entity32 -- support is on the rise			2
according to a @entity0 poll released may 20 , 37 % of the public now supports the movement , a level that approaches the high - water mark the tea party achieved in 2010			1
why the increase in popularity ? it 's simple : the @entity32 scandal resonates with the @entity4 faithful because it fits so well the meme the movement has pushed since the early days of the administration : an @entity23 - led government is too big , too fiscally irresponsible			2
first , there was the movement 's resistance to the stimulus package , claiming the government spent too much to revive the economy			0
then , of course , was the @entity4 's opposition to health care reform : again , government had grown too big , spending excessively			0
and that some people would be forced by the government to purchase insurance or else face a tax , for tea partiers , was further proof of @entity23 - led governmental tyranny			0
now , the @entity32 scandal permits the tea party to highlight how the administration is overreaching and meddling in the lives of @entity70			1
but here 's the thing : most political scandals do n't last very long			0
those involving the president , or officials in his administration , tend to have a shelf life of six months			0
as it stands , we 're not even six months beyond the most recent election cycle			0
so the likelihood that the tea party -- and therefore @entity84 -- can leverage the recent scandals to their political advantage is n't great if the next election cycle ( 2014 ) is the target			1
if the tea party and republicans wish to make political hay that will carry them through 2014 , they must return their gaze to the substantive policy issues that tend to mobilize their supporters : immigration reform and same - sex marriage are two examples			1
indeed , opposition to immigrant rights and same - sex rights has proven effective for rallying the base			1
the problem is that if the tea party returns to issues proven to fire up the base it will violate at least two of its major tenets : fiscal prudence and smaller government			1
for instance , the @entity4 's position on immigration reform would increase government spending to the tune of $ 28 billion per year to secure the border			2
in the case of same - sex rights , the state is called upon to regulate marriage			1
this would seem to contradict the @entity4 's claim that it 's all about fiscal prudence and small government			2
how can this be ? in other words , how can the tea party and its supporters favor small and large government ? the paradox is easily resolved once we consider the motives of many tea party supporters			1
they see @entity70 changing too rapidly , both demographically and culturally			0
@entity70 identity is generally identified as white and heterosexual , among other things			0
thus , it should n't come as a shock that despite their declared preference for small government , many in the tea party embrace big government when necessary			1
it 's perhaps the most effective way to police what they perceive as encroachments upon the " @entity70 " way of life in which white racial identity and heterosexuality remain the norm			0
like @entity70 reactionary movements of the past , the tea party resists change of any kind			2
for tea party loyalists , the long and short of it is as follows			0
in president @entity23 's first term , the government spent too much ; so far , in his second , the government is meddling too much			0
the problem for the tea party is that the benefits extracted from these missteps will likely be short - lived , certainly not enough to last until the next election cycle			2
is n't it ironic that to sustain support through 2014 , and to have a shot at the @entity171 , the tea party will have to push policy solutions to important issues that rely upon bigger -- not smaller -- government ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			1

he says to maintain support , tea party must make dust - up last till 2014 elections
it could return to issues that fire base : immigration , opposition to same - sex marriage , he says
