-- @entity1 has entered a " state of war " with neighboring @entity2 , according to a report saturday from the state - run @entity4 that included a threat to " dissolve " the @entity7 mainland			1
" any issues regarding @entity12 will be treated in accordance to the state of war , " @entity1 's government said in a special statement carried by @entity4			2
" ... the condition , which was neither war nor peace , has ended			0
" @entity1 and @entity2 technically remain at war since their conflict between 1950 and 1953 ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty			1
on march 11 , the @entity1 army declared the armistice agreement invalid			2
this report represented @entity26 's latest salvo aimed at @entity2 and its ally the @entity7			1
tensions in the area have been ratcheting up for months , with @entity1 remaining defiant and , in some opinions , belligerent in the face of international efforts to halt its nuclear program			1
saturday 's report included a direct threat to the @entity7 , while also asserting @entity26 " will not limit ( itself ) to limited warfare but to all - out war and nuclear war			1
" " we will first target and dissolve mainland @entity7 , @entity40 and @entity41 , and @entity7 military based in @entity2			1
and the ( @entity2 presidential office ) will be burned to the ground , " the @entity4 report said			2
in a statement later saturday , @entity2 did not treat their neighbor 's latest threat as anything new			1
@entity51 noted scores of its personnel had entered the @entity54 -- a joint economic cooperation zone between the two @entity56 situated on the @entity58 's side of the border -- on saturday morning with hundreds more set to join them later in the day , seemingly suggesting they were going about business as usual			0
" the announcement made by @entity1 is not a new threat , but part of follow - up measures after @entity1 's supreme command 's statement that it will enter the highest military alert " on tuesday , @entity2 's @entity66 said in a statement			1
@entity73 appears to show @entity7 targets a day earlier , same official @entity1 news agency reported its leader @entity76 had approved a plan to prepare standby rockets to hit @entity7 targets			1
in a meeting with military leaders early friday , @entity76 " said he has judged the time has come to settle accounts with the @entity7 imperialists in view of the prevailing situation , " @entity4 reported			0
the rockets are aimed at @entity7 targets , including military bases in the @entity89 and in @entity2 , it said			2
" if they make a reckless provocation with huge strategic forces , ( we ) should mercilessly strike the @entity7 mainland , their stronghold , their military bases in the operational theaters in the @entity89 , including @entity40 and @entity41 , and those in @entity2 , " the report said			1
analysis : just what is @entity76 up to ? @entity1 state media carried a photo of @entity76 meeting with military officials friday			2
in the photo , the young leader is seated , leafing through documents with four uniformed officers standing around him			0
on the wall behind them , a map titled " plan for the strategic forces to target mainland @entity7 " appears to show straight lines stretching across the @entity89 to points on the continental @entity7			1
@entity2 and the @entity7 are " monitoring any movements of @entity1 's short , middle and middle - to long - range missiles , " @entity120 spokesman @entity119 said friday			1
@entity7 official : we 're ' committed ... to peace , ' unlike @entity1 @entity7 officials have said they 're concerned about the torrent of threats coming out of @entity26 in recent weeks			1
" i think their very provocative actions and belligerent tone , it has ratcheted up the danger , and we have to understand that reality , " defense secretary @entity128 said thursday			0
some observers have suggested that @entity135 is adding to tensions in the region by drawing attention to its displays of military strength on @entity1 's doorstep , such as the flights by the @entity144 stealth bombers			0
@entity145 argued against that assertion			0
threats of annihilation normal for @entity2 " we , the @entity7 and @entity2 , have not been involved in provocating anything , " he said			2
" we , over the years , have been engaged with @entity2 on joint exercises			0
the @entity144 flight was part of that			0
" @entity135 and its allies " are committed to a pathway to peace , " @entity145 said			0
" and the @entity1 seem to be headed in a different direction here			0
" opinion : why @entity1 regime is scary amid the uneasy situation , @entity162 , a key @entity1 ally that expressed frustration about @entity26 's latest nuclear test , also called for calm			1
" we hope relevant parties can work together to turn around the tense situation in the region , " @entity167 spokesman @entity167 said friday , describing peace and stability on the @entity170 as " a joint responsibility			0
" behind @entity1 's heated words about missile strikes , one analyst said , there might not be much mettle			0
@entity1 's threat : five things to know " the fact is that despite the bombast , and unless there has been a miraculous turnaround among @entity1 's strategic forces , there is little to no chance that it could successfully land a missile on @entity41 , @entity40 or anywhere else outside the @entity170 that @entity7 forces may be stationed , " @entity183 , @entity184 editor of @entity185 , wrote in an opinion column published thursday on @entity0			1
tensions have been rising for months tensions escalated on the @entity170 after the @entity58 carried out a long - range rocket launch in december and an underground nuclear test last month , prompting the @entity201 to step up sanctions on the secretive government			0
@entity7 officials concerned about @entity1 's ' ratcheting up of rhetoric ' @entity26 has expressed fury about the sanctions and the annual @entity7 - @entity2 military exercises , due to continue until the end of april			1
the deteriorating relations have killed hopes of reviving multilateral talks over @entity1 's nuclear program for the foreseeable future			1
indeed , @entity26 has declared that the subject is no longer up for discussion			0
the recent saber - rattling from @entity26 has included threats of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the @entity7 and @entity2			1
most observers say @entity1 is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile , but it does have plenty of conventional military firepower , including medium - range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles			2
having already declared the armistice invalid , @entity1 more recently said it was cutting a key military hotline with @entity2			2
@entity1 has gone through cycles of " provocative behavior " for decades , @entity232 spokesman @entity231 said thursday			0
" and we have to deal with them			0
we have to be sober , calm , cool , collected about these periods			0
that 's what we 're doing right now , " he said			0
" and we are assuring our @entity2 allies day to day that we stand with them in the face of these provocations			2
