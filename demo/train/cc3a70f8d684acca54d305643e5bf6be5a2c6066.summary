" the @entity8 ' with @entity1 honed in on two separate allegations of misconduct in 1998 and 2002			1
when @entity1 retired in december 1999 , an investigation of his alleged actions a year before had never been made public , but were later detailed in the grand jury 's report			1

the four - hour interview was conducted at the home of his lawyer over two days , where he insisted that his decades of work with troubled youths as part of his charity the @entity155 had been " twisted " by prosecutors			0
" they 've taken everything that i ever did for any young person and twisted it to say that my motives were sexual or whatever , " @entity1 said			1
" i had kid after kid after kid who might say i was a father figure			0
and they just twisted that all			0
" but an attorney for a 29 - year - old alleged victim of @entity1 's , who is not among the eight people named in the grand jury report , said the interview is further evidence that the former coach " can not resist center stage			1
