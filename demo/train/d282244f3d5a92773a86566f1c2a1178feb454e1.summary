" however , the witness said protesters retained some control inside the city , which security forces were surrounding			1
" they ( @entity13 's forces ) have n't been in control and they never were in control , " said one rebel fighter , who said his forces lost seven men in fighting in @entity5 on friday , versus what he said were some 20 casualties among government fighters			1

such clashes have spurred throngs of people to flee the country			0
the number of people trying to leave the country has declined in recent days , however , as heavily armed government forces have intensified their presence at the @entity155 border and on roads leading up to it , the @entity148 refugee agency said friday			2

" so i think there is some concern about whether refugee reports are entirely accurate in a sort of macro sense			2
" he added , " i think what the president is trying to do is to try to build diplomatic support and see where we can go with this			0
and i think it would be highly problematic if he just jumped into something			0
" the @entity266 has rejected international intervention , saying @entity1 is facing " an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments			1
" but the league can not ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no - fly zone in coordination with the @entity277 if fighting were to continue , said @entity278 , chief of staff of the @entity266			0
