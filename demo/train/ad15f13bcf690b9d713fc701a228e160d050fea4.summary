-- a @entity2 court intervened friday to stop a 13 - year - old girl from attempting to sail around the world by herself , stripping her parents of sole custody			1
@entity7 will find out on friday whether the @entity8 will back her record attempt			1
@entity7 's parents support her round - the - world ambition , which sparked concern from child protection officials because of her age			1
they took the case to court to prevent the solo trip			1
on friday the @entity2 @entity19 in @entity20 ruled that the @entity21 will share custody over @entity7 with her parents for two months			1
the move prevents the parents from permitting @entity7 to set off on her trip alone , though @entity7 will remain at home with her father , @entity29 , a court official said			1
during those two months , a child psychologist will assess @entity7 's mental state and ability to carry out a solo round - the - world journey , a court official said			1
a guardian will be appointed to oversee the case until the court next meets oct. 26			0
the court will then make a final ruling on whether her parents may have the final say about their daughter 's plans , the court official said			2
is the court right to block her bid ? have your say below @entity7 's parents are happy about friday 's decision , family lawyer @entity48 said			1
he said the parents are especially pleased that the court did n't prevent @entity7 from making the journey , because they hope she can still proceed with her plans			1
the teenager was out sailing friday , @entity48 said			0
she is pleased with the decision and hopes she can still make a solo trip , he said			2
@entity7 believes she will be able to convince the court that she is fit to make the trip alone , @entity48 said			1
social workers took the action to stop the teen from attempting to become the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe because they believe the voyage would be too dangerous			1
@entity7 said she has dreamed of sailing around the world since she was 10 and her parents are determined to help her achieve her goal			2
she called the attention that has been heaped on her case " a bit over the top			0
" just this week , a @entity76 teenager became the youngest person to sail around the world solo when he returned to @entity76 after a nine - month trip			1
@entity79 confirmed the feat. @entity81 , 17 , had a support team sailing alongside him during the trip			0
he said he does n't think age alone should determine whether @entity7 is ready for such an adventure			2
it 's " whether she 's got the physical strength , the mental strength , or the technical ability , " he said			0
" can she strip an engine blindfolded ? can she build boats ? is she an electrician ? is she a mechanic as well ? you ca n't just be a sailor for a trip like this			0
" another sailor , @entity98 , also said age should n't be the only determining factor			0
he was the first person to circumnavigate the globe alone without stopping -- in 1969 , when he was 29			2
" it 's really more a question , is that person , that young person , mature enough to be able to look after themselves and deal with everything that 's going to come at you when you get out alone at sea ? " he said			0
@entity112 - winning @entity111 sailor @entity110 insisted that sailing is an experience - based sport and that @entity7 may not be ready for such a great challenge			2
" @entity81 has four years on @entity7			2
that 's a big difference , " she told @entity0			0
" @entity81 had already completed challenges such as sailing across the @entity119 before embarking on his ultimate quest			0
" there 's a world of difference between sailing a small craft on the @entity125 and sailing around the world with all the challenges that presents			0
" @entity127 also pointed out that " we live in a culture of record - breaking and fame - seeking , " with people constantly looking to be the youngest or quickest at anything			0
" why does she need to sail around the world on her own now ? why not sail with a parent first to gain more experience ? " @entity0 's @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 contributed to this story .			0
