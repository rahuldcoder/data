@entity0 -- is this week 's anti-american chaos in the @entity4 world going to be president @entity7 's @entity6 moment or @entity9 challenger @entity8 's @entity11 moment ? the unrest so far in @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 -- embassies attacked , an @entity18 ambassador killed , spreading protests -- evokes memories of another @entity18 crisis more than 30 years ago			1
in 1979 , @entity22 celebrating their revolution invaded the @entity24 in @entity25 and took 52 @entity18 hostage to launch a crisis that helped doom @entity6 's re-election bid a year later			2
@entity8 and some conservative backers seek to draw parallels between the @entity6 and @entity7 presidencies , hoping to weaken what has been a major advantage for @entity7 on foreign policy and cement in voters ' minds that he does n't deserve a second term			1
@entity8 : ' a strong @entity18 is essential to shape events ' the question is whether the strategy at a vital moment in the november election campaign , following the two party conventions and heading into the debates , will end up raising or sinking @entity8 's hopes			2
unable to catch up in the polls , the former @entity49 governor launched immediate and initially inaccurate criticism of @entity7 's foreign policy on tuesday night -- the 11th anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks -- after first reports of protesters breaching the @entity24 in @entity14 and of an attack that had killed an @entity18 at a @entity18 diplomatic compound in @entity13			1
" it 's disgraceful that the @entity7 administration 's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions , but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks , " the @entity8 statement said in reference to a @entity62 embassy statement that was released before protesters stormed the compound			1
when news emerged wednesday that the @entity13 attack killed four people , including @entity18 ambassador @entity76 , @entity8 found himself criticized by @entity77 and some @entity9 and conservatives for what they depicted as a crass and non-presidential move			2
" governor @entity8 seems to have a tendency to shoot first and aim later , " @entity7 told @entity82 in an interview on wednesday			1
" and as president , one of the things i 've learned is you ca n't do that			0
it 's important for you to make sure that the statements that you make are backed up by the facts and that you 've thought through the ramifications before you make them			0
" @entity7 : @entity8 overstepped on @entity13 , @entity14 attacks @entity98 , a contributing editor at @entity99 , wrote on the group 's website that @entity8 tried unsuccessfully to apply his campaign theme that @entity7 has been a weak leader to a situation that did n't fit			1
he called the mistake akin to @entity11 's unorthodox reaction to the unfolding financial crisis during the 2008 campaign , when the @entity109 senator called for both candidates to suspend campaigning and insisted the fundamentals of the economy were sound in the face of collapse			0
a more reasoned response by @entity8 " would n't have fit his ready - made scheme of @entity7 - as - @entity6 , but it would have spared him of most of the ridicule he 's receiving now , " @entity98 wrote , adding : " now instead of portraying @entity7 as @entity6 , he has presented himself as the bumbling @entity11 figure of 2012			1
" @entity122 , a former chief of staff and campaign adviser to @entity11 , also took issue with @entity8 's move , writing on the website realclearpolitics.com that " the rush by @entity9 -- including @entity8 , @entity128 and scores of other conservative critics -- to condemn ( @entity7 ) for policies they claim helped precipitate the attacks is as tortured in its reasoning as it is unseemly in its timing			2
" " i understand the @entity8 campaign is under pressure from some republicans to toughen its attacks on the president , " wrote @entity122 , comparing it to similar pressure on @entity11 four years earlier			2
" ... but this is hardly the issue or the moment to demonstrate a greater resolve to take the fight to the president			0
" after his vigorous attacks on @entity7 on tuesday night and wednesday , @entity8 dropped some of the harshest rhetoric from remarks at a campaign event on thursday in @entity154 while continuing to label the president as a weak leader			2
" as we watch the world today , sometimes it seems we 're at the mercy of events rather than shaping events , " he said , later adding that " the world needs @entity18 leadership , the @entity158 needs @entity18 leadership , and i intend to be a president that provides the leadership that @entity18 respects and will keep us admired throughout the world			0
" for his part , @entity7 emphasized @entity18 muscle on thursday in promising a @entity174 campaign event that " no act of terror will go unpunished			2
" the president added that he instructed his administration to " do whatever is necessary to protect all @entity18 who are serving abroad			0
" opinion : @entity8 foreign policy attack was disgraceful the back - and - forth on the issue reflects the competing efforts by the @entity7 and @entity8 campaigns to frame the election in terms favorable to their candidate			1
@entity7 seeks to make it a question of competing visions for the future , while @entity8 pushes for a referendum on @entity7 's presidency at a time of high unemployment , sluggish economic recovery and mounting federal deficits and debt			1
@entity8 previously has sought to tie @entity7 to the troubled , one - term @entity6 presidency , focusing on the economy -- considered the most important issue of the campaign			1
however , @entity8 trails @entity7 in the latest polling , particularly on foreign affairs			1
a recent @entity1 / @entity205 poll showed @entity7 favored over @entity8 on foreign policy by 54 % -42 %			1
with less than eight weeks to the election , @entity8 appeared to leap at the chance to challenge @entity7 on foreign policy when first reports of attacks on @entity18 compounds in @entity14 and @entity13 emerged			1
he continued to sharply criticize the administration on wednesday , saying it sent " mixed messages " on @entity18 values and policy to the rest of the world			0
" i think it is a terrible course for @entity18 to stand in apology for our values , " @entity8 said of the statement issued by the embassy in @entity62 that condemned the anti-islam video that fomented protests outside the compound			0
" when our grounds are being attacked and being breached ... the first response of the @entity18 must be outrage at the breach of the sovereignty of our nation			0
and apology for @entity18 's values is never the right course			0
" although @entity8 said the statement was released after the violence at the embassy , in fact it was released hours earlier			0
@entity243 turmoil evokes political response @entity77 quickly fired back , with former presidential candidate @entity245 saying @entity8 's comments demonstrated " an insensitivity and a lack of judgment about what is happening right now			0
" " i do n't think he knows what he 's talking about , frankly , " the @entity252 chairman from @entity49 told @entity1			0
however , some republicans including @entity8 's running mate in november , conservative rep. @entity256 , quickly came to @entity8 's defense			2
" it 's never too early to be in strong support of the @entity18 values to stand up for what we believe in and to condemn those people who are damaging our property , " @entity256 said in an interview with @entity259 in @entity260			0
conservative analyst @entity268 , the daughter of former vice president @entity269 and a former @entity271 official in the @entity273 administration , accused @entity7 of a litany of missteps that she said weakened @entity18 influence abroad			0
" apologizing for @entity18 , appeasing our enemies , abandoning our allies and slashing our military are the hallmarks of mr. @entity7 's foreign policy , " @entity269 wrote in the @entity277 , concluding that " an @entity18 already weakened by four years of an @entity7 presidency will be unrecognizable after eight			1
" @entity9 strategist @entity285 , a @entity1 contributor , agreed that @entity7 's foreign policy was " weak " and " vacillating , " but he also acknowledged that @entity8 must win the foreign policy debate that the candidate himself launched to the forefront of the campaign			1
to @entity98 , the @entity8 gambit appeared to be a desperate move by a campaign that " knows it 's losing			0
" " when senior @entity9 foreign policy professionals start referring to this as his ' @entity298 moment , ' likening it to @entity11 's mid-september meltdown in response to the financial crisis , we can see that @entity8 's latest attempt to seize on an international event has done significant and possibly irreparable damage to his campaign , " @entity98 wrote			1
" most @entity18 may not sympathize with @entity8 's more aggressive foreign policy , but they might have been willing to believe him to be competent and have good judgment			1
this blunder undermines his claims to both of these			0
" @entity312 , online gaming maven among @entity314 dead @entity1 's @entity315 and @entity316 contributed to this report .			0
