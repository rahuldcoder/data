@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 prime minister @entity3 has denied allegations that she failed to heed warnings of possible corruption in a rice subsidy program whose recent problems have stoked anger among farmers in the country 's rural heartland			1
the controversy over the rice program has deepened the political crisis in which @entity1 has been mired for months			2
@entity1 's @entity16 ( @entity16 ) said tuesday that it was bringing charges against @entity3 over the program , which pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their rice but has run into financial problems			1
the commission has summoned @entity3 , whose government is already under pressure from months - long protests in @entity0 , to appear february 27 to be notified of the charges			1
" i wish to assure you that as i have served my duty with righteousness and contrary to the charges brought against me by the @entity16 , i have done nothing wrong , " @entity3 said in a statement thursday			1
the anti-corruption commission 's charges , which accuse @entity3 of ignoring warnings of corruption in the program , could eventually lead to the suspension of the prime minister from all political positions			1
" though i may be charged in this criminal case and may have to give up my position in accordance to the wishes of those who want to topple my government , i will still lend my full cooperation and give necessary information to the @entity16 , " she said			0
@entity3 insists that the rice subsidy program , introduced in 2011 , has been successful and benefited farmers			1
but critics says it has wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters , hurting exports and leaving the government with large stockpiles of rice it ca n't sell without losing money			0
the program has encountered intensified difficulties after an election earlier this month was disrupted by anti-government demonstrators and failed to deliver a conclusive result			0
the situation has left @entity3 's weakened caretaker government struggling to operate effectively and ensure payments are made to rice farmers			1
angry farmers problems with the subsidy program have angered many farmers , normally an important component of @entity3 's support base			1
groups of farmers have held protests in recent weeks after not being paid for their rice			0
about 3,000 farmers from central @entity1 spent thursday night camped out on the outskirts @entity0 after traveling on tractors , trailers and quad bikes			1
they had threatened to take their protest to the city 's main airport , @entity91 , if they did n't get paid what they 're owed			1
but the leader of the group of farmers , @entity98 , said friday that they would be heading home later in the day after the government informed them they would be paid early next week			0
the farmers said their planned protest was n't political -- unlike the anti-government demonstrators in central @entity0 , they say they do n't want to see the ouster of @entity3			1
but they do want their money			0
long - running protests the tensions over the rice program come against the backdrop of the protests by groups affiliated with @entity3 's political opponents			1
those demonstrations , calling for @entity3 to step down , have been taking place in central @entity0 since november and have been plagued by outbreaks of deadly violence			2
earlier this week , police tried to clear demonstrators out some protest sites			0
but the efforts resulted in violent clashes that left five people dead , including one police officer , and dozens wounded			0
police have since suspended their attempts to seize the protest sites for the time being			0
and a court ruled wednesday that the government ca n't use force and weapons against peaceful unarmed protesters			0
the protest leaders say they want to rid the country of @entity3 and her wealthy brother , the deposed former prime minister @entity138			2
@entity138 , who lives in exile , faces a corruption conviction , which he says was politically motivated , if he returns to @entity1			2
political opponents say @entity3 , who convincingly won elections in 2011 , is simply @entity138 's puppet , an allegation she has repeatedly denied			2
the protests were sparked in november by @entity3 's government 's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for her brother 's return to the political fray in earnest			2
the protesters say they want @entity3 's government replaced by an unelected " people 's council , " which would oversee electoral and political changes			0
@entity2 's @entity159 and @entity160 reported from @entity0 , and @entity161 reported and wrote from @entity162 .			0
