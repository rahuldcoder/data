-- entrepreneur and media mogul @entity1 is not afraid of a challenge			1
he took on @entity5 media barons to set up his publishing company in 1981 and provoked the wrath of the @entity9 government when he spoke out against the 1989 @entity11 crackdown against pro-democracy protesters			1
on topics ranging from @entity9 to the economic crisis , @entity1 opened up to @entity0 's @entity15			1
despite taking on such formidable opponents , he continues to run a successful publishing company in @entity5 and @entity18 and remains outspoken defender of a free press and freedom of speech			1
" i think when you are not free you do n't have dignity			0
and to me it 's not a political issue whether you have democracy or what , it 's a moral issue , " he told @entity0 from his offices in @entity5			1
these days the @entity28 tend to turn a blind eye to @entity1 , but his criticism of them post @entity11 -- calling then prime minister @entity32 a " turtle 's egg " ( an unpleasant insult in @entity9 ) in an editorial -- precipitated his downfall in the clothing business			1
after the controversy he had to sell his stake in @entity41 , the clothing company he set up in 1975 or risk the closure of all his shops in mainland @entity9			1
it cost him millions in lost business opportunities			2
he 's suffered other business failures ; a shopping web site set up during the first dot.com boom was one of a number of causalities when the bubble burst			1
@entity1 , however , remains philosophical about money			2
" i think i 'm a bit different to other people because i 'm actually from a very rich family so i had the riches , i had the sense of it			0
i was never insecure about money			0
i was very poor , but i never felt sorry			0
" hailing from southern @entity9 , @entity1 's family was wealthy but marginalized by the communist government			1
after working as a railway porter boy , @entity1 dabbled in the black market before being smuggled into @entity5 when just 12 years old , taking a job as a child laborer and earning just over $ 1 a month			1
" you know i was free			0
i was full of hope			0
when i saw people in a @entity75 , in a @entity73 , there was no envy , there was no jealousy , there was just hope that one day i was the one that will sit there , " he told @entity0			0
" you know the opportunity is there			0
you know that it is open for you			0
that was a wonderful society			0
you know that if you try hard , you will get it			0
" @entity1 's can - do attitude and the heady free - market environment have proved to be a winning combination			2
however , @entity1 insists that freedom to make money is not the only thing that inspires him to run his publishing company			1
he remains politically aware and often an outspoken critic of @entity9 at a time when many try a more diplomatic policy of engagement			2
" it 's the dictatorship that rubs me up the wrong way			0
it 's the freedom that we , the @entity9 people , are not allowed to flourish			2
i think when you are not free you do n't have dignity			0
and to me it 's not a political issue whether you have democracy or what , it 's a moral issue , " he said			0
optimistic , determined , sometimes contrary , @entity1 is committed to pursuing his business interests in @entity5 and @entity18 , as both value the freedom of press			1
he believes @entity18 will be a " very powerful catalyst that will change @entity9 "			1
" in @entity9 you have a vacuum of moral infrastructure ... it 's just the free market and the government			1
so if the market fail and the government is dragging down with it , what is hold the whole society up ? " he said			0
" i think if @entity9 has to make decisions to take measures which are so painful , without the mandate of the people they ca n't do it			2
that will be the beginning of a new @entity9			2
@entity9 will have to go through a political restructuring			2
