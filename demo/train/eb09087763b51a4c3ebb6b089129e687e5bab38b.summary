-- just days after a @entity2 flown by @entity3 made an emergency landing with a hole in its fuselage , the @entity1 said in a press release monday that it will mandate operators of about 175 specific older @entity2 737s to conduct inspections for wear and tear			1
the @entity1 said the " emergency directive " it plans to issue on tuesday would affect about 80 @entity13 - registered 737 - 300s , 737 - 400s and 737 - 500s , mostly operated by @entity3			1
the remaining 95 or so aircraft are registered outside the @entity13			1
each of the 175 or so planes in question have taken off and landed more than 30,000 times and will receive repetitive electromagnetic inspections at regular intervals for fatigue damage			1
in a separate statement , @entity2 said it was working with the @entity1 , the @entity24 and @entity3 , and it was preparing a service bulletin to recommend lap joint inspections on certain 737 models			1
@entity24 board member @entity28 said monday that inspectors have visually checked lap joints in the past , but have n't used high - tech monitoring , because no one thought that part of the plane was susceptible to cracks			1
moving forward , inspectors will test the joints with an electromagnetic process			2
the chairman on the @entity40 said in a statement that the @entity13 public wants answers to retain confidence in commercial air travel			2
" as the details of this unusual incident unfold , we will get a better understanding of what caused the plane 's fuselage to tear open , " said sen. @entity46 , @entity47			0
" i expect the @entity1 to be painstakingly diligent in reviewing the safety of all aircraft , and to conduct a careful investigation into what caused the cracks that have been discovered on the bodies of these planes			1
" @entity46 took advantage of the occasion to renew his call for reauthorizing the @entity1			2
" the @entity1 reauthorization bill now headed to conference takes steps to strengthen the inspection process of passenger aircraft , and i hope we can move that bill quickly to a resolution , " he said			1
after @entity3 canceled about 600 flights over the weekend to accommodate inspections , the airline said it canceled another 70 flights on monday			1
by 3:30 p.m. monday , the company had checked out 67 of the 79 planes it had grounded for inspection			1
@entity3 said 64 of the 737 - 300s were being returned to service , while inspectors had discovered subsurface cracks on three jets			1
those three will remain out of service " until @entity2 recommends an appropriate repair , " @entity3 said			2
as planes are cleared , they will be put back into service , @entity3 said			1
inspections are expected to be completed by late tuesday			2
the airline recommended that customers should check with the website @entity95 for the status of a particular flight or rebook a trip before heading to the airport			0
eighteen minutes into @entity101 from @entity102 to @entity103 , @entity104 , on friday , a hole 5 feet long and 1 foot wide opened in the fuselage , causing the cabin to lose pressure , the @entity24 said			2
one flight attendant received minor injuries , the agency said			0
the pilot initially planned to return to @entity102 , but he made an emergency landing at a military base in @entity115 , @entity116 , after flight attendants reported seeing blue sky through the jet 's roof , the safety board 's @entity28 told reporters			0
some of the 118 passengers who were aboard the crippled @entity2 said they feared for their lives			0
" we were in shock , " passenger @entity124 said saturday			0
" we were in row 16 , and my husband and i could see blue sky ... the wiring , the cabling			0
" @entity132 said fellow passengers panicked and screamed as the sun shone through the cabin			0
" most people were just white knuckles , holding on to the arm rests , " he said			0
the airline said it provided a full refund , an apology and two complimentary round - trip passes on the airline for future flights			0
in july 2009 , another @entity145 made an emergency landing when cabin pressure dropped because of a football - size hole in the jet			0
that incident prompted the airline to inspect its entire fleet of 737 - 300s			0
earlier that same year , the airline was fined $ 7.5 million by the @entity1 after the agency found that @entity3 operated 46 of its @entity155 on nearly 60,000 flights without performing mandatory inspections for fatigue cracks in their fuselages			1
@entity28 said the 737 used for @entity101 had a maintenance check in march at @entity3 's @entity162 facility , and the jet had no outstanding maintenance issues at the time of the accident , with all its records " positive , up to date , ( and ) with no discrepancies			2
" the plane 's flight data recorders had no noteworthy information on them , @entity28 said			0
