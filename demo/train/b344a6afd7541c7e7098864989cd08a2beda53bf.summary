when it comes to finding a doctor , chances are you spend a lot more time worrying about your man , your kids , or your parents than yourself			1
after all , you 're strong enough to soldier through the occasional cold , right ? if this sounds like you , you 're not alone : in a recent survey , nearly a third of @entity11 who do n't have a primary care physician ( @entity14 ) said they did n't think they needed one			1
the truth is , we all do			1
not only do people with a regular doc receive better overall care , but it 's easier for them to get an appointment on short notice -- helpful for reassurance on day - to - day health queries , and especially crucial if you should ever find yourself in a serious health crisis			1
" finding a doctor before you get sick is especially important now that more insurance plans are requiring that @entity35 serve as gatekeepers for our medical needs , " says @entity30 , author of " @entity31 : the ten mistakes @entity39 "			1
your mission : to locate an @entity43 with great experience ; an organized , friendly office staff ; and , most of all , the ability to collaborate well with you ( it is , after all , your body and health )			1
@entity46 : secrets women keep from their doctors step 1 : go to your network your social network , that is			2
start by asking your friends and family ( and any doctors you have and like ) for the names of their favorite docs			1
this method may seem unscientific , but in one recent survey , doctors ranked getting a recommendation from family or friends as the most valuable way for you to choose a good physician			1
consider also checking an online doctor - rating site , like vitals.com or zocdoc.com			2
just keep in mind that opinions from others may be a good gauge of a doctor 's bedside manner ( which is indeed important ) , but not necessarily a way to measure her medical ability			2
" friends who have had only annual checkups do n't have as good a sense of their doctors ' medical competence , so see if you can ask someone who 's had health trouble , " @entity78 says			1
" if they felt well - served by the doctor , that 's a better bet			2
" that was true for @entity91 , 36 , a @entity92 website editor : " recently , i noticed a spot on my chest			2
my friend suggested i see her doctor , dr. @entity96			2
" @entity96 had found a melanoma on @entity91 's friend 's roommate , who raved about his care and professionalism			2
" he not only checked the spot , but also found a mole on my thigh that turned out to be a melanoma , " she says			2
" i was so glad to have a thorough doctor who caught it early			2
" if your friends do n't give you any good leads , contact your nearest academic medical center ( a hospital linked to a medical school , also known as a teaching hospital ) and ask for a referral			1
" those centers are usually highly rated , " says @entity118 , @entity43 , director of the @entity121 / @entity120 / @entity119 for the @entity122			0
@entity46 : what to do when you disagree with your doctor step 2 : check out her credentials there 's no need to limit yourself to doctors who graduated from the fanciest medical school around			0
what matters more , says @entity118 : " the hospital where they did their residency , and where they practice			1
" two reasons why : a residency is where physicians get their on - the - job training , and the other @entity43 's they practice with seem to affect their clinical style more than where they went to school			1
look for a doctor who is board - certified and affiliated with a reputable hospital ( your insurance company 's website will generally list credentials and affiliations ) , since , if you ever wind up being hospitalized , this will likely be the place you 'll go			1
" academic hospitals generally do better in terms of safety and patient outcomes than unaffiliated community hospitals , " says @entity118			0
@entity161 can help you assess the quality of hospitals in your area			0
@entity46 : want to skip the doctor ? try this step 3 : vet the office you can find out some key details about a prospective doctor just by calling her			0
start with how you 're greeted			0
if the receptionist treats you poorly , it may be a sign that the practice is n't respectful of patients in general , says @entity78			1
if the doctor and her staff are nice and professional , on the other hand , you will know that she runs a practice where patients are treated with respect			1
@entity46 : how to have a great doctor - patient relationship step 4 : size her up in person once you 're finally face - to - face with the @entity43 , do a gut check			0
do you feel comfortable ? your health will benefit if you do : a recent study in the @entity195 found that patients who had empathetic , engaged physicians felt more supported and were better able to take charge of their own well - being			0
last year , @entity200 , of @entity201 , went in search of a new primary care doctor because her last one was dismissive of her complaints of exhaustion			0
she vetted a prospective doc online , then set up an appointment			0
" after an hour , i decided to switch to him , " says @entity200 , 52 , who works in the caregiving industry			0
" he really took time to listen to me			0
" her new doctor ordered a complete blood panel , and within a couple of days , @entity200 had a diagnosis : her thyroid was sluggish			0
" the problem could have gotten worse , " she says			0
" it worked out because i found a doctor who really listens			0
" you may not get an hour with your prospective @entity14 the way @entity200 did , but all you need is a few minutes to tell if she 's up to snuff			1
@entity118 recommends that you bring three questions about your health issues , big or small , to your first appointment			0
as the doctor answers your queries , think to yourself : does she explain things well ? does she consult with me and give me time to ask follow - up questions ? a doctor who does these things -- and makes you feel comfortable -- just might be your perfect match .			0

nearly a third of @entity11 who do n't have a @entity14 said they did n't think they needed one
ask for recommendations from your family or friends when trying to choose a physician
what matters most is the hospital where they practice and where they did their residency
