the @entity1 administration announced revisions to the @entity4 contraception mandate so that nonprofit religious organizations can opt out of signing a release form to avoid covering birth control and workers for those nonprofits are able to obtain separate contraception coverage without a copay			1
" this is part of ensuring that all women have access to contraception coverage , " said a senior administration official			0
earlier this month the @entity16 issued a temporary order that allows @entity18 to avoid covering birth control without filing a religious exemption form with its insurer			1
the new revisions to the @entity4 mandate reveal that the @entity23 is anticipating the @entity25 @entity16 's finalization of the temporary injunction in the coming months			2
" in light of the @entity16 order regarding @entity18 , " said the official , " the departments intend to augment their regulations to provide an alternative way for objecting nonprofit religious organizations to provide notification , while ensuring that enrollees in plans of such organizations receive separate coverage of contraceptive services without cost sharing " the july ruling on behalf of the evangelical @entity42 school was seen as an important victory for those objecting to a compromise that aimed to allow coverage and allowed a workaround for those opposing it			1
the new @entity23 revision aims to resurrect that compromise but cut out the so - called permission slip that had been a requirement for employers to skirt the @entity4 contraception mandate			0
the rules , which are still being worked out , will provide an " alternative way for objecting nonprofit religious organizations to provide notification , " according to the @entity23			0
in a brief filed tuesday in the @entity25 10th @entity60 , the @entity58 said that " the @entity18 injunction does not reflect a final @entity16 determination that the @entity63 requires the government to apply the accommodations in this manner , " but that the rules outlined in the brief are meant to augment a @entity70 accommodation process that will no longer require the use of a form -- for any institution -- if the temporary order for @entity18 is enacted for all religious nonprofits			1
the senior @entity23 official said that " the administration believes the accommodation is legally sound			0
" the @entity23 expects to issue the regulatory revisions within a month , upon which time the @entity16 will be informed of the interim final rules			2
