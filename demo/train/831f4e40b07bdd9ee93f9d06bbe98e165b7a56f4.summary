@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 , set to begin handing over power to his successor , warned thursday that a failure to deal with corruption could bring down @entity3 's ruling @entity8 and the state it controls			1
@entity2 was speaking at the party 's 18th @entity10 in @entity0 , a key meeting of top officials that will usher in a new set of leaders of the world 's most populous nation			1
after a decade in power , @entity2 is expected to hand over the party 's top job to vice president @entity21			1
" if we fail to handle this issue well , it could prove fatal to the party , and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state , " @entity2 said of corruption during his speech at the start of the congress in the @entity26 in the heart of the @entity3 capital			1
his comments to a vast room full of delegates stood out in light of the huge political scandal that has rocked the party this year			1
the controversy involved the former high - flying politician @entity44 who is now under criminal investigation after being ousted from his posts and the party itself			1
he is accused of corruption , abuse of power and improper sexual relationships ; official news reports have said @entity44 made " severe mistakes " related to the killing of a @entity56 businessman -- a crime for which @entity44 's wife was imprisoned -- and a diplomatic incident involving his former police chief in @entity62			0
more than 2,200 delegates from across @entity3 are gathering for the @entity10 , and they in turn select the 200 - plus members of the party 's @entity66 , who in turn appoint the @entity69 and ultimately the all - powerful @entity70 -- the country 's decision - makers			1
but most , if not all , of the outcomes are predetermined after a long period of secretive deal - making between party power brokers			1
the congress itself meets every five years			0
it is designed to assess the country 's progress , and set new directions			2
every 10 years it selects the new leadership			0
this year , the legacy of the @entity2 years is under the microscope			2
under @entity2 and premier @entity88 , @entity3 's economy has continued to grow , lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty			0
@entity3 is now the world 's second - biggest economy and closing fast on the @entity93			0
but there have been disappointments and discontent along the way , and @entity2 's much vaunted " harmonious society " is showing signs of cracking			0
@entity3 leaders have endured a tumultuous year			2
the veil of secrecy around the party has been lifted , with reports of rifts and infighting			2
and the fall of @entity44 brought about @entity3 's biggest political scandal in decades			2
@entity44 , once party chief of the massive metropolis of @entity62 , is now in disgrace awaiting trial			2
his wife , @entity113 , is in prison , convicted of murdering a @entity56 business associate			0
senior party leaders and their leaders have had to deal with unusual scrutiny of their affairs , with @entity121 news organizations publishing investigations into the wealth accumulated by the families of @entity21 and @entity88			2
@entity3 authorities responded to the reports by blocking the websites of the news organizations involved : @entity128 and the @entity129			0
but @entity3 's army of censors is having to grapple with the rapid rise of social media platforms on which information moves and mutates at a dizzying pace			0
@entity3 is treading many fault lines : a widening gap between rich and poor , rising unrest about issues like pollution and land seizures , and a slowing economy that some say is in need of serious reform			0
@entity2 mentioned some of those tensions thursday along with several other contentious issues -- like food safety , health care and law enforcement -- acknowledging that " there are a lot of difficulties and problems on our road ahead			0
" another issue @entity2 's government has struggled to tackle during its decade in power is the discontent and unrest among @entity162 living under @entity3 rule			1
authorities were given a grim reminder on wednesday of the disillusionment and desperation of many @entity162 in western areas of @entity3 after four people set themselves on fire to protest @entity3 rule			1
one teenage @entity162 monk died and two were injured after self - immolating in a majority @entity162 region of @entity175 , said @entity176 , a spokesman for the @entity162 parliament in exile in @entity179 , @entity180			1
and a 23 - year - old @entity162 woman died a separate incident in @entity183 , @entity176 said , citing unidentified people in @entity162 areas			1
dozens of @entity162 are reported to have set themselves ablaze in the past 18 months to express their unhappiness with @entity3 rule			1
in his speech thursday , @entity2 also made a case for @entity3 to strengthen its presence on the seas off its coast			0
@entity0 has become embroiled in a string of territorial disputes with countries like @entity196 , the @entity197 and @entity198 over areas thought to contain large reserves of natural resources under the sea bed			1
the leadership should " build @entity3 into a maritime power , " @entity2 said , citing the need to exploit marine resources and " resolutely safeguard @entity3 's maritime rights and interests " among the goals			0
@entity210 : what do you think of the power transition ? share your comments and experiences and best could be used online or on air			0
