the rollout of the @entity1 has been unquestionably rocky , but the rush to judgment was over the top			1
critics had their knives out even though little data are available on initial program enrollment and success			0
it 's much too early to declare the program either a failure or a success			1
commentators who claim certainty need to be more humble in recognizing how little we know yet and more patient until we know more			0
all the focus on the website problems obscured those benefits the @entity1 has already created since its passage in 2010			2
more than 3 million young adults have gained insurance coverage after family coverage was extended through age 26			1
since the law passed , closing @entity33 's " doughnut hole " allowed more than 7 million seniors and disabled people to save an average of $ 1,200 per person on prescription drugs			1
consumers have saved about $ 5 billion over the past two years through requirements that insurers spend at least 80 % of the premium dollar on care for patients			2
and 71 million @entity40 with private insurance , as well as 25 million enrollees in @entity33 , have gained coverage for at least one free preventive service			2
the years since the @entity1 was passed have been marked by the slowest three - year period of health care cost growth on record			1
the @entity1 does n't bear full credit for this slowdown , particularly given the weak economy			2
but the fact that the slowdown has persisted even as the economy has improved , and the fact that costs have grown more slowly even within the @entity33 program whose enrollees are largely protected from economic shocks , suggests that the @entity1 is playing some role in this historic slowdown			1
the early success stories have been ignored in all the attention paid to the implementation problems			2
the premiums offered on the exchanges cost 16 % less than what the @entity65 projected them to be			0
this results in significantly lower costs to people and saves almost $ 200 billion in the federal government budget			0
of course , the biggest changes to our system took place @entity76			0
but it is simply too early to judge their impact			0
for example , when @entity80 piloted the approach embodied in the @entity1 , we had very slow enrollment , with only 123 paying customers signing up the first month our subsidized insurance was available			1
there was a rush of enrollment right before the individual mandate kicked in , and ultimately over three years the program covered about two - thirds of the state 's uninsured citizens , leaving @entity80 with a 3 % uninsured rate , the lowest in the nation			1
so , when will we be able to draw conclusions ? the first date to focus on is march 31 , when we can measure how many people enrolled in private and public insurance			1
yet what matters more than total enrollment is the health mix of enrollees , relative to what insurers expected when they provided their lower - than - expected insurance bids			1
we wo n't really know about this health mix until the end of may , when insurers release their rates for 2015			1
i expect that we will see only moderate increases in insurance rates at that point , as the federal government has created risk - sharing programs that should mitigate any " rate shock " to the market			0
but we wo n't know for sure until we see the rates			0
the next key time to check success will be the fall of 2014 , when the government releases its initial figures on the changes in insurance coverage			0
although many have made bold claims about how this law will impact coverage by private and public insurance , we simply wo n't know until we see the data from our major household surveys of insurance coverage , available in the fall of 2014			0
ultimately , the projections of the @entity65 suggest that the @entity1 will not be fully implemented for three years , the amount of time it took to ramp up to full implementation in @entity80			1
so we wo n't be able to draw final and firm conclusions until late in 2016			0
this timetable might seem long , but a change as large as the @entity1 takes time			2
we must be patient in evaluating that change			0
once the data come in , and enough time for the law to be fully implemented has passed , we can truly draw conclusions about this signature episode in the history of @entity40 social policy .			0

@entity151 : it 's way too early to declare the @entity1 a failure or a success .
@entity151 : it 's improved health care since 2010 for young adults , those on @entity33
he says a *crucial* measure on march 31 will be health mix and number of enrollees
@entity151 : it will take three years to fully implement , like @entity80 ' law did
