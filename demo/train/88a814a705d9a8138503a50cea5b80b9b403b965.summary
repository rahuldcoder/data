@entity0 -- nearly a year later , @entity2 remains a flashpoint in @entity0 for two very different reasons : indefensible pre-attack policy decisions and irresistible post-attack politics			2
the @entity10 @entity9 , from the president on down , complains of " phony " @entity12 - led congressional investigations			1
yet the administration 's own reluctant , and at times inaccurate , responses to congressional inquiries have contributed to the @entity17 charge that the administration , at a minimum , has been less than transparent			1
" we need to get to the bottom of what happened that terrible night , why it happened , and how we can prevent similar tragedies in the future , " house speaker @entity23 said last week in serving notice the @entity2 investigations would continue into the fall , and include new subpoenas for documents and testimony if necessary			1
there are legitimate questions about why repeated and specific warnings about the @entity2 security situation were undervalued or ignored			1
both lawmakers and intelligence professionals point to this weekend 's unprecedented wave of @entity41 and @entity43 embassy closings as , at least in part , a lesson learned from the september 11 , 2012 , attack that killed ambassador @entity47 and three other @entity48			2
embassy closures extended after @entity51 message intercepted republicans , however , have at times undermined their own claim to be interested only in legitimate congressional oversight , not what @entity56 often label a partisan witch - hunt			1
@entity23 , for example , has at times privately urged lawmakers leading the investigations to focus on what the evidence shows -- and not let their partisan instincts allow their public rhetoric to get out ahead of the facts			2
exclusive : dozens of @entity69 operatives on the ground during @entity2 attack also undermining the @entity17 effort : fund - raising e-mails and videos from @entity12 and conservative groups asserting a @entity2 cover up orchestrated by president @entity10 and then - secretary of state @entity76			1
" you 've got a very valid point , " rep. @entity78 , chairman of the committee leading the @entity2 review told @entity1 in an interview for " @entity82 , " a one - hour program looking at the attack and at the lingering policy and political questions			2
" i would prefer that fund - raising by outside groups stay away from the hard work of @entity92			2
" but it is n't going to happen			2
" @entity78 demands more @entity95 documents on @entity2 early 2016 jockeying also factors into the politics			1
@entity17 sen. @entity98 says @entity99 is responsible for the sub-par security in @entity2 even if , as she says , the stream of warnings and requests for more personnel never reached her desk			1
" that 's precisely her culpability , " @entity98 told @entity1			2
" when you lead the @entity95 , decisions in one of the most dangerous countries in the world should rise to your level			2
that 's your job to make sure those messages get to you			2
" @entity17 strategist @entity120 understands the @entity17 effort to use @entity2 to tarnish @entity99 's image , but describes her as the most " formidable " @entity56 2016 hope and adds , " i do n't know that @entity2 alone would sink a @entity99 candidacy for president			1
" and if the attacks now are somehow designed to discourage @entity99 from running , veteran @entity56 strategist and @entity99 ally @entity130 suggests an opposite reaction			1
" she 's never been a person to back to down to a bully , " @entity130 said in an interview			0
" @entity76 is the type of person to be motivated by that			0
to stand up and fight back			0
" @entity2 politics often get more attention because of the personalities involved			0
but there is also a policy divide			0
@entity12 say they do not yet have a full picture of three critical issues : â € ¢ why the warnings did n't reach the point where the @entity95 either sent more security help or ordered the @entity2 mission closed			1
â € ¢ why , especially given the weeks of threat warnings , there was no viable military option to assist the @entity95 personnel at the @entity2 mission and the predominantly @entity69 - run annex that came under attack later same evening and where two of the four @entity48 were killed			1
â € ¢ and why , nearly a year later , no one has been brought to justice			0
new fbi director @entity160 is being pressed to update @entity92 on the investigation within a month of his officially beginning work next month			2
lawmakers press @entity165 on @entity2 on the military response question , the @entity166 now says it is making significant improvements in its contingency planning for responding to embassies in danger zones			0
but former @entity166 brass told @entity92 there was no viable option that night , with then - defense secretary @entity175 saying the military " should not be a 911 service capable of being on the scene within minutes			0
" the top @entity178 on the @entity179 , rep. @entity180 of @entity0 , calls @entity2 a tragedy but labels continued @entity17 questioning a witch hunt			1
" the bottom line is there was not a force available that could get there in time , " @entity180 told @entity1			0
" so i do n't think these questions need to be asked again			0
" @entity17 rep. @entity189 , however , says that his classified briefings have included information that convince him more could have been done			1
" how is it that we have a man down , in this case four men down and an injured person , and the cavalry never comes over the hill , " @entity189 said			0
on the first question , the administration 's official review , by what is known as the @entity203 , found a series of @entity95 bureaucratic failures at several levels , but found no negligence			0
" a whitewash , " is how @entity78 describes that analysis			0
that process was led by veteran diplomat @entity212 , who has served in both @entity56 and @entity12 administrations			1
@entity212 defended the integrity of the review in the weeks after its release			0
he several times , however , canceled scheduled interviews with @entity1 and ultimately said his attorney had advised him not to speak to the network			0
now , @entity9 investigators are pursing documents the review board used in its review and this is likely to be one fall focus			1
former cia director @entity227 , the retired @entity228 general and a veteran of many @entity0 dramas , said @entity17 talk of a cover up is " a loaded word			1
" but he says there is , nearly a year later , a lack of full clarity in determining where the biggest security related mistakes were made			1
" this is team ball , " @entity227 said			0
" there are a lot of people who now look back and say , ' i should have done that			0
i could have done that			0
maybe i could have prevented this			0

@entity9 complains of investigations but its reluctant responses contribute to @entity17 charge
@entity12 have undermined their claims of oversight that @entity56 call a witch hunt
possible presidential candidates ' involvement makes 2016 jockeying a factor
former @entity69 director says there is still a lack of clarity on what biggest security lapses were
