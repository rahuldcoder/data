-- are you pessimistic , chronically worried and stressed - out , and ill at ease socially ? you may be at higher risk of heart attack and other heart problems , a new study suggests			1
people with a history of heart disease who are prone to negative thinking , gloom , and inhibition -- a personality profile known as @entity16 ( for " distressed " ) -- are nearly four times more likely to experience heart attack , heart failure , heart rhythm disorders , death , and other negative outcomes compared to heart patients with a different personality profile , the study found			1
@entity0 : surprising heart attack risks " there is a clear connection between heart risk and psychological risk factors , and those people who have this personality and lack social support have higher risk of health problems , " says @entity27 , @entity28 , director of the @entity29 at @entity31 's @entity30			1
( @entity27 was not involved in the new study			0
) the lead author of the study , @entity42 , @entity43 , a professor of medical psychology at @entity46 , in the @entity41 , first proposed a @entity16 personality in the mid- 1990s , after he and his colleagues observed that distressed heart - attack survivors had higher short - term mortality rates than people with more upbeat personalities			1
type d personalities are " characterized by negative emotions like anxiety , frustration , and anger , and at the same time score high on social inhibition , meaning that they are less likely to disclose emotions , " @entity42 says			0
@entity0 : 10 things to say ( and not say ) to someone with depression the @entity16 personality was modeled after the better - known @entity65 and b personalities , which grew out of heart research conducted in the @entity68 in the 1950s			1
the aggressiveness , impatience , and hostility that characterizes the @entity65 personality has long been linked to an increased risk of heart disease			2
experts do n't fully understand why the @entity16 personality appears to affect heart risk			1
genes may be partly responsible , but the chronic stress associated with @entity16 traits is also a likely culprit			0
consistently high levels of one stress hormone , cortisol , are a known risk factor for heart attack			1
" stress hormones and stress reactions are great in fight - or - flight -- like when a prehistoric man was being chased by a saber - toothed tiger -- but they are not so good when they flood your body 24/7 , " says @entity86 , @entity28 , the co-director of preventive cardiology at @entity89 's @entity88			0
@entity0 : job killing you ? 8 types of work - related stress type d personalities may also turn to smoking , alcohol , overeating , and other unhealthy behaviors as a way of coping with their emotions , @entity86 adds			1
and , as @entity42 points out , " @entity16 's are less likely to exercise , and [ are ] also rather poor at adhering to medical treatment or advice by their doctors			0
" in the study , which appears in the journal circulation : @entity116 and @entity117 , @entity42 and his colleagues re-analyzed data from 19 studies comprising more than 6,000 people			0
( @entity42 led many of the studies himself			0
) they found that heart patients with type d personalities were 3.7 times more likely than those with other personality types to experience future heart problems			1
in addition , the @entity16 patients were three times more likely to experience depression , anxiety , and other forms of emotional distress			2
the link between heart risk and type d personality persisted even after the researchers took into account whether the study participants were depressed			2
this suggests that @entity16 personality presents a health risk independent of depression , a condition that itself increases the risk of heart disease			1
@entity0 : loneliness hurts the heart type d personality and depression are not the same thing , although there is some overlap between them			2
while depression tends to occur in episodes , the emotional distress associated with @entity16 personality is chronic and may never reach the level of clinical depression , according to the study			2
the findings shine a light on a high - risk population , @entity27 says , adding that doctors should ask patients about their social support systems in an effort to identify those who may have @entity16 traits			2
( for just that purpose , @entity42 and his colleagues have developed a questionnaire that asks patients to rank how well 14 statements -- such as " i take a gloomy view of things " and " i find it hard to start a conversation " -- apply to them			0
) @entity0 : 7 types of therapy that can help depression type d personalities are n't doomed to heart problems , but they should be aware of their risk and take precautions , such as enrolling in cardiac rehabilitation if they 've had a heart attack , the researchers say			1
" @entity191 need to take a more active approach toward their own health , " @entity42 says			0
" they may benefit from counseling , so that they can learn how to deal with everyday stressful situations in a more adaptive way			0
there are some proactive tools and actions that these people can take to get rid of the negative emotions they keep inside			0
