-- @entity1 , energy sapped and unable to train properly , knew something was wrong last year			0
exercises she once did easily were becoming harder and getting through matches was proving difficult , too			1
it was a surprise , since the young @entity8 prospect was considered a player with good stamina and has already earned a reputation for wearing down her opponents , not vice versa			0
after a first - round victory at the @entity16 , @entity1 felt particularly exhausted			0
" i won 6 - 4 in the third set , but i remember saying to my coach that i feel like i 've just been hit by a bus , " the 21 - year - old recalled			0
at first she thought it was a sinus infection			0
then a couple of months later , following the @entity23 tennis event at @entity24 , @entity1 picked up a stomach bug and had to go to hospital			1
" i kept going back to the doctors because i was n't getting better , " @entity1 said			1
" i was still feeling very low on energy and they were like , ' no , you should already be over the stomach virus			0
' so then they started doing more tests , and that 's when they found out what it was			1
" the diagnosis was mononucleosis , a viral illness that can linger for weeks , months or even years			1
it has earned the nickname of the " kissing disease " because it can get passed from one person to another through saliva			0
fortunately for @entity1 , her bout was coming to an end			0
@entity1 , though , is n't the only tennis player in recent years to be afflicted with mono or the name it 's also known by , glandular fever			1
others on the list top men 's players @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 have been struck down , while @entity64 , like @entity1 a player with promise , revealed she had mono in april			1
@entity67 , another promising player on the women 's tour , announced last week on @entity70 that she had mono			1
soderling and @entity62 were n't as lucky as the likes of @entity59 , @entity1 and @entity64 , who hopes to return to action at the @entity16 , which starts this weekend			1
indeed the severity of cases varies , as does an individual 's capacity to fight off and cope with infections			1
@entity61 , the @entity16 finalist in 2009 and 2010 , has n't played since 2011 and it is looking increasingly likely that he wo n't ever come back			1
the @entity79 with the massive forehand -- who handed @entity81 his only defeat at @entity83 -- started to feel unwell in the spring of 2011 and later said it was a mistake to compete at @entity24 that year			0
@entity62 , hailed as a potential winner at @entity24 after reaching the semifinals in 2004 , attempted to play through his flu - like symptoms during a @entity89 series against @entity90 in 2007			0
he said he felt so dizzy in his singles opener he missed a ball completely , but he still contested the doubles a day later			0
he was ready to play the deciding fifth rubber if needed , although with @entity90 already clinching the tie he was replaced by a young @entity96			0
" @entity101 saved me , " @entity62 , known for his work ethic and willingness to play through injuries , said in an interview in 2007			0
@entity62 re-emerged on the tour but was never the same and a teary - eyed @entity103 had to retire two years ago aged 26			1
@entity104 , the current world no. 2 , feared he had mono four years ago , and it 's an illness he 's still wary of , telling the @entity108 in march : " you can get run down and end up missing two or three months of the year because of an illness			1
" your immune system gets run down and then you lose weight			0
it 's happened with a lot of guys with glandular fever the last few years so it 's something everyone has to look into			1
" continuous travel , training former pro @entity121 is n't surprised that tennis players are susceptible			1
the players have to , at times , switch continents on a weekly basis , and they travel 10 - 11 months in a year			1
unlike golf , cricket or @entity130 , others sports that require continual global travel , the players also push themselves to the limit physically			1
the career of @entity121 , who now commentates and serves as a player representative on the @entity138 @entity138 's board of directors , was blighted by a back injury			1
" i think that 's the thing people do n't understand -- the heightened intensity does damage to your body , immune system , energy levels , on the fitness of your muscles , ligaments , tendons , " @entity121 said			1
" it 's just a very tough sport			1
i truly believe that @entity81 , @entity104 , ( @entity156 ) @entity155 and @entity59 , these guys are n't only the best tennis athletes in the world , they are some of the best athletes in the world			1
" there 's a whole culture of being tough and strong and pushing through pain and being a warrior			2
" but i can tell you right now at 37 years old walking my dog , my body feels the brunt of probably doing a lot of things and pushing through barriers i probably should n't have			2
that 's the product of an individual sport			2
" at first @entity174 , a consultant neurologist in @entity175 who has treated marathon runners , footballers and tennis players with mono , said it was a " myth " that those involved in tennis are more vulnerable than other athletes			1
but he subsequently acknowledged that when factoring in their travel , the severity of the illness can intensify			2
" we know people with fatigue illnesses related to the effects of viruses travel badly , " he said			0
" if you take someone with a chronic fatigue syndrome and stick them on an airplane at ( @entity200 's ) @entity199 to the @entity8 they 'll do an eight - hour flight			2
that can have a devastating effect on them for days afterwards			0
" preventing mono can be difficult , but @entity174 said it 's important that players heed warnings			1
if they suddenly develop a cold , fever , sore throat or stomach issues , it 's vital to rest instead of continuing to train and play matches			1
stopping not easy as @entity121 pointed out and @entity174 knows through his own experience in working with sportsmen and women , that is n't always easy			2
" when you and i have the flu , we go to bed and within a week or two we 'd be back to normal , " @entity174 said			0
" why these people get symptoms that go on for weeks , months and years is usually because -- and i 'm now generalizing -- they do n't stop when they have the first symptoms and tend to push through , and they 're under stress			2
" diagnosing mono is n't simple , either , said @entity174			1
he said there is a lack of specialists and that doing a battery of tests at the outset may not be efficient			0
he will usually spend nearly two hours talking to patients in a first consultation before making a clinical diagnosis			0
" then there are a limited number of blood tests that need to be done to make sure there is nothing else contributing to it , " @entity174 said			2
the women 's tennis tour said in an email that player health and well being was a " priority			1
" but the age of many of its pros is another reason why tennis players would appear to be at risk			1
" mononucleosis most commonly occurs in people between the ages of 15 and 24 , which is our athlete population , " said @entity255 , senior vice president , sport sciences and medicine & transitions , with the @entity259			0
the men 's tour said in an email that mono " has not been of unusual concern for the players or the @entity270			1
" " professional athletes are not immune to illnesses which affect the general public in general , " said @entity271 , medical advisor to the @entity138 @entity138			2
" while we are concerned about and take all injuries and illness seriously , and although some high profile players have suffered from glandular fever in recent years , the incidence of this particular illness amongst our players in general has not been unusually high			1
" @entity1 did n't think her tour needed to do more to help players			1
" i think we 're probably more susceptible to getting it because our bodies are more run down from traveling so much , " she said			2
" also sometimes i take a water bottle -- they all look the same -- to the court and all of a sudden i 'm like , ' this was n't my water bottle			2
' sometimes it gets transferred like that			0
" i know a lot of my friends have gotten it			0
for them it was n't a big issue			2
it 's amplified when you 're an athlete			2
" tough comeback for @entity1 her road back has n't been smooth			2
@entity1 , like others before her , did n't stop playing for a while			2
but after losing five straight matches , she finally decided to sit out the remainder of 2012 and not contest the @entity313 indoor swing			0
the losing streak rose to eight by the time this january 's @entity315 ended			0
as high as no. 24 in the world last summer , her health issues largely contributed to her ranking sliding to 55th			0
she has resumed training fully and played for nearly three hours against 2012 @entity16 finalist @entity320 in @entity321 on wednesday but knows she must be careful			0
" they did tell me there 's a chance i could get a relapse , so i have to take it easy if i 'm feeling extremely exhausted , " she said			0
" but i think i 'm past that point			0
i do n't feel any side effects of what i had			0
i feel like i 'm fully over it now			0
i was lucky my case was n't extremely bad like some others			0
