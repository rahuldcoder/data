-- in recent weeks , sen. @entity1 galvanized the nation with a 13 - hour filibuster , became the toast of the @entity5 and embraced immigration reform before the @entity7			1
it 's naive to think that a few speeches can reshape the @entity10 , but @entity1 may well represent a tectonic shift on the @entity13 right			1
the junior senator from @entity15 has a vision of the @entity17 in full , advocating the @entity19 's right to keep and bear arms and the @entity22 's right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure			1
he 's for civil liberties -- to protect against police abuse or presidential drones , as well as economic liberties and the freedom to run a business without unnecessary regulation			2
and he wants to give the blessings of those liberties to those who come to @entity13 in search of a better life			0
@entity1 has some ideas for republicans as a libertarian and a traditional conservative , we disagree with @entity1 on a number of issues			1
yet we both see his constitutional conservatism as auguring a future in which social tolerance , fiscal temperance and a humbler role for government are pursued not as ends in themselves but because that 's the best path			1
conservatives " conserve " society by reacting to the excesses of previous generations , but the issues that prompt the reactions vary according to the times			0
even the solutions to the same problems may shift with new information and reflection			1
@entity63 founder @entity62 , a key figure in the modern conservative movement , famously changed his mind about civil rights , the drug war and even @entity69			0
conservatives started the environmental movement with @entity73 's protection of national parks at a time when natural resources were plundered without regard to public health			0
but now , environmentalists abuse the @entity80 to protect salamanders at the expense of jobs and the @entity85 's wetlands protections to prevent development			0
similarly , conservatives argued for larger police and military forces in response to crime and communism , but now that cost is part of our fiscal problem			2
opinion : @entity1 is right modern conservatives need to remember these lessons as they consider the future			1
their predecessors were largely successful in defeating communism , liberalizing the economy and reducing crime			0
but those policies were n't perfect ( or cheap ) : the crime - fighting of the 1980s and ' 90s , with an emphasis on policing and incarceration , contributed to current problems such as unfunded pensions , bloated government unions and overcrowded prisons			0
after the election losses in 2012 , some @entity10 have advocated a need to change			1
in comes @entity1 , who may well be on the leading edge of a new conservatism , which will focus on four areas : 1			1
its social policy will focus primarily on protecting freedom of conscience in an increasingly pluralistic society , while undoing the excesses of the drug war and punitive sentencing for nonviolent crime			2
for example , as the country moves toward acceptance of same - sex marriage , some states have restricted the ability of @entity135 charities to continue functioning without violating key religious tenets			0
people may disagree on moral issues , but a nation where religious charities ca n't operate is a far worse place			0
this new conservatism will align with the ideas of governors such as @entity145 of @entity146 and @entity147 of @entity148 , who are fighting battles for domestic policy reform			2
at stake are the power of public - sector unions and the future of entitlement programs such as @entity156 and @entity157			0
the challenge is to fix our fiscal woes while protecting the vulnerable in society , as religious conservatives understand is required by their faith			2
without fiscal temperance , as well as education reform and a better regulatory environment , there will neither be the opportunity for social mobility nor resources for a social safety net , public or private			1
we also need to unwind our military engagements while maintaining flexibility in a rapidly changing world			0
numbers do n't lie , and our debt and deficits demand a reduction in military spending			0
conservatives should aim to achieve the necessary reductions in a smart fashion that maintains readiness and does n't endanger @entity13 's interests			0
this will be a challenging balancing act , but it should be driven by strategic concerns rather than arbitrary benchmarks			0
finally , conservatives should consider comprehensive immigration reform that would allow skilled and unskilled workers to seek their @entity13 dream while granting parole , not amnesty , to those hard - working migrants now here illegally			2
@entity1 , @entity197 provide competing glimpses of a revamped @entity10 this recipe may not be the " ideal " that conservative pundits would like to see , and it does n't necessarily reflect our utmost individual preferences , but it reflects the practical realities of this age			1
@entity1 has n't ( yet ) changed conservatism , but his views will shape the movement 's future			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 and @entity212 .			1

@entity211 , @entity212 : @entity1 may represent a shift in conservatism
@entity211 , @entity212 : @entity1 has a vision of the @entity17 in full , which is promising
they say the new conservatism will focus on areas such as fiscal temperance , immigration
@entity211 , @entity212 : practical realities call for @entity10 to shift solutions accordingly
