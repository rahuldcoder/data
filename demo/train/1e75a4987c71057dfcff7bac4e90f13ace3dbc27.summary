-- " transformers : @entity8 " showed its summer might once more by holding onto the no. 1 spot in its second weekend of release , grossing an estimated $ 36.4 million from 4,233 locations and effectively shutting out the slate of new releases			1
@entity10 's explosive epic also hit $ 400 million internationally after just 12 days in release			2
but , overall , it was a quiet holiday weekend at the box office , and the gap between 2013 and 2014 summer earnings only continues to grow			1
none of the week 's new releases were ever going to match last year 's @entity18			0
among the weekend openers was @entity21 ' r - rated comedy " @entity26 " ( @entity27 ) , which managed to take in just $ 21.2 million in its first weekend in release and $ 32.9 million across the five - day , cooling star @entity25 's recent box office hot streak			1
the second place opening is n't a disaster by any meansâ € ” the pic only cost $ 20 million to produceâ € ” but it also did n't meet the studio 's modest expectations ( $ 37 million across five days )			0
on top of that , the lousy @entity27 means that this one will drop hard and fast			0
in third place , @entity41 ' and @entity42 ' " @entity39 " ( @entity43 ) grossed an estimated $ 9.5 million from 3,049 locations this weekend , bringing its five - day total to $ 15 million			1
the " based on true accounts " supernatural tale reportedly cost $ 30 million to produce			0
it also earned $ 2.5 million from 16 markets internationally			0
@entity51 's 22 " @entity50 " snagged the fourth place spot in its fourth weekend with $ 9.4 million from 3,324 locations			1
that 's only a 41 percent fall from last weekend for the comedy , which now boasts a domestic total of $ 158.9 million			1
@entity56 's " @entity58 " rounded out the top five with an $ 8.75 million weekend			1
transformers : age of extinction -- $ 36.4 million weekend ( $ 174.7 million domestic ) 2			1
@entity26 -- $ 21.17 million weekend ( $ 32.91 million domestic total ) 3			1
@entity39 â € ” $ 9.5 million ( $ 15 million domestic total ) 4			0
22 jump street -- $ 9.4 million ( $ 158.85 million domestic total ) 5			0
@entity58 -- $ 8.75 million ( $ 140 million domestic total ) " @entity67 to @entity68 , " meanwhile , opened at no. 6 and earned an estimated $ 8.25 million across the three - day and $ 13.5 million over its five days in release from 3,230 screens , failing to meet analyst and distributor expectations by a few million dollars			0
@entity69 bought the family - friendly pic from @entity71 in 2013 , which follows a group of friends who discover an alien in their small town and resolve to help him find his way home			0
the inexpensive pic ( $ 13 million ) was released over the holiday in an effort to provide counter-programming to a slate mostly devoid of family films ( an industry low since 2007 )			1
and , while it may have missed the mark opening weekend , the @entity86 could indicate that word of mouth will be strong for this movie and that it 'll perform decently across the next few weeks			2
in notable expansions , distributor @entity90 rolled out @entity95 's " @entity94 " ( @entity96 ) to 1,105 theaters this weekend where it brought in an estimated $ 2.7 million , bringing its domestic cume to $ 4.04 million			2
@entity97 also expanded to 250 theaters and took in $ 998k across the three day weekend			2
check back in next weekend to see if " @entity100 " can help salvage this summer 's box office slump			2
