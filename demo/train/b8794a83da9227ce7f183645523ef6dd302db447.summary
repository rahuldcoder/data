we know an industry is in crisis when its top institutions can not establish stable leadership			2
that is the case with some of our nation 's best public universities today			1
when the @entity9 at the @entity10 pressured president @entity11 to resign on june 10 , she became the fourth leader of a flagship public university to leave office under a cloud of controversy recently			1
the other casualties included the highly respected leaders of the @entity19 , the @entity20 and the @entity21			2
the president of the @entity23 has also announced that he will step down in december			0
leaders of public universities in other states face equally strong pressures to go			1
the men and women in these jobs seem to have a target on their backs			0
this ca n't go on			2
our nation 's public universities are the heart and soul of our higher education system , which is the envy of the world			1
flagship public universities educate more of the brightest high school students than private universities in many states			1
they conduct the lion 's share of advanced research			0
they also attract the largest number of foreign students			0
if our public universities fall into a decline because of a leadership vacuum , then our entire system will decline , too			1
@entity10 leaders are an endangered species because they are wedged between opposing and powerful pressures that are undermining public universities			1
government officials in state capitals want to cut funding while requiring far - reaching reforms			1
they demand more control over costs that have risen much faster than inflation or family income in the last decade			0
they also ask for increased public access to flagship universities through traditional and online forms of education			1
governors and legislators want all these benefits as they continue to reduce state expenditures for higher education			2
professors and administrators on campus view these reforms as attacks on serious education and research			1
advanced training in the sciences , engineering and humanities requires intensive small - group work that can not be subjected to assembly - line efficiencies			0
anyone who has taught writing , for example , knows that there is no substitute for the instructor sitting with the student and going line - by - line through each sentence			0
the same is true for theoretical physics , medicine , law and many other fields			0
you need extended time and personal contact for young minds to mature as effective thinkers			0
that is expensive , but it is money well spent for the good of the society			0
it 's the same for advanced research			0
innovation and creativity require freedom , security and flexibility			0
scholars must have the ability to pursue a question in depth and examine its many implications			2
sometimes an important project may take years to complete			0
without university research of this kind we would not have many of the technologies and medicines we take for granted today			2
governors and legislators have a strong argument about the elitism , the inefficiency and the sometime self - serving nature of university faculty			2
professors have a strong case for the merits of what they do , and the remarkable record of achievements and historical job - creation coming out of our best public universities			1
the system works for some , but not for everyone			0
the system produces value , but at costs that might not be sustainable			0
@entity10 leaders are caught in the middle			2
governors are impatient for new " efficiencies			0
" professors are adamant about protecting the freedom necessary for their work			0
university presidents have the title to address these issues , but they have little power when funding is tight and the two sides are equally uncompromising			1
no one wants to acknowledge the legitimacy of the other side 's point of view			0
wealthy alumni groups are very generous and loyal to their alma maters , but they can not solve this crisis			0
although alumni want their universities to be the best in the world , their support ( as generous as it may be ) can not replace government money			2
despite steep decreases in state funding for universities , state and federal agencies provide the largest share of money to public universities for research and related activities			1
the @entity189 , for example , is the dominant funder for medical research in the world			0
states own the land on which public university campuses are built			2
so where do we go from here ? reforms to public universities are indeed necessary , but they will not emerge effectively from political attacks and vindictive cuts			1
what we need is an open and participatory process where university boards , state leaders , faculty , students and campus presidents formulate measurable goals for reasonable reforms , cost - savings , and more efficiency			1
these discussions should also include meaningful incentives for increased excellence ( in teaching and research ) , public accessibility and international recognition			2
university presidents should be empowered to pursue these goals , in a reasonable time frame , with transparent accountability			1
while faculty must preserve the essential freedoms for their creativity , they can not expect to do this by protecting privileges at all costs			0
along with administrators , they have to accept changes to their comfortable routines			0
if both state and campus communities contribute to mutually beneficial changes , the reformed public university of the 21st century will be much improved			1
at present , the attacks on university leaders from all sides are attacks on the very idea of a public university			1
when @entity243 designed the @entity10 , and when @entity244 created the federal land - grant system to finance public education , they had a faith that the most advanced intellectual work would improve the nation as a whole			0
that is what they meant by the " public " in university			2
@entity243 and @entity244 's support for public higher education made the @entity258 a model for the rest of the world			1
we need leaders in government and on campus with the same vision -- the same desire to use limited resources not as instruments for political or personal advantage , but as opportunities for constructive engagement and the greatest long - term public good			1
public universities need protection and they also need serious , thoughtful reform			1
let 's start with giving university presidents a fair chance to do their work .			1

@entity282 : some of the best public universities in @entity258 are *losing* their presidents
@entity286 : university leaders are caught between pressures from state officials and faculty
he says reforms to these institutions are needed , but political attacks and *budget* cuts wo n't help
@entity286 : university presidents should be empowered to pursue common goals
