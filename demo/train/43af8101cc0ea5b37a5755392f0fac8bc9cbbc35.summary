@entity0 and @entity1 almost did n't get the ultrasound			1
you do n't really need it , the doctor told them , but come on in if you like and have a look at your baby			1
they watched excitedly as the baby , just 12 weeks old , moved its hand across the screen			1
it looked like a wave hello to @entity16 and @entity17			1
excuse me , the technician said as she put down the ultrasound wand and headed toward the door			1
" is everything ok ? " the @entity22 asked			1
" no , " the technician answered and walked out of the room			1
@entity27 - high rate of a birth defect nearly two years after the state of @entity31 was alerted to a possible cluster of babies born with severe birth defects , experts are speaking out , criticizing the state health department for not doing enough to save babies ' lives			1
for four years in a row , from 2010 through 2013 , the rate of babies born with a brain defect called anencephaly -- a type of neural tube defect -- in one rural area of @entity31 has been more than four times the national rate			1
the defect is always fatal			1
the @entity31 @entity47 has steadfastly refused to interview the parents of these babies and has failed to accept offers of help from world - renowned anencephaly experts			1
" it really looks like they 're dragging their feet , " said @entity54 , a pediatric geneticist and birth defect expert at the @entity56			1
he said that to find the cause of the cluster , state investigators need to speak with the parents of children with birth defects in the three - county area to see whether they might have something in common			1
but the state has not contacted these parents			1
" this is the highest rate of anencephaly since a cluster in @entity73 back in the ' 90s , and they should get in there and figure it out			1
but they do n't seem very excited about it , " @entity54 said			1
that @entity73 outbreak was found to be associated with moldy corn consumed by the mothers			1
a team of experts on this mold offered help to @entity31 investigators back in february but has n't received a response			1
" we 're frustrated that they 're not moving more quickly to find the cause , " said @entity89 , one of the mold experts and an associate professor of pharmacology at the @entity94 in @entity95			1
the @entity31 @entity47 has defended its response to the high rate , pointing out that it did a review of the mothers ' medical records and , this month , created an advisory committee to help with the investigation			1
a state epidemiologist , @entity105 , said that at some point , investigators hope to work with the mold experts			1
if all of that is n't enough of a response , that 's partly because the state 's epidemiologists believe the increased rate could be random , @entity105 said			1
though it is indeed high , the number of anencephaly cases is so small -- 8.7 per 10,000 births -- that next year , the rate could be back in line with the rest of the country			1
the national rate is 2.1 cases per 10,000 live births			2
" clusters come and go , " said @entity105			2
" this could possibly be a statistical blip			2
" but @entity54 and others say they think a fourfold increase is no blip			2
with anencephaly , the baby is born without a fully formed brain			1
there 's no chance of survival			2
research has suggested that pregnant women are at higher risk of neural tube defects if their intake of folic acid is low before and during pregnancy			2
the @entity146 has seen a 27 % drop in such case since it started fortifying grains with folic acid			2
' the lamest excuse i 've ever heard ' when the ultrasound tech walked out the door , the @entity22 were left alone , @entity0 's stomach still exposed with the ultrasound gel on it			2
" it 's ok , " her husband kept repeating , but @entity0 could n't even look at him			2
she just stared at the wall , listening to the sound of her own heart beating louder and louder			2
the tech returned with the doctor			2
" he told us our baby had anencephaly and had no chance of survival			2
he was surprised he 'd made it this long , " @entity0 said			0
" he went to the computer and brought up a picture of a deceased baby with anencephaly , and there was no skull past the eyebrows			0
the image is seared into my head forever			0
" the @entity22 scheduled a pregnancy termination for two days later , on june 30 , 2012			0
in the meantime , they went home to wait			0
" i was inconsolable , " @entity0 said			0
" i had a baby inside me that was living , and his heart was beating , but i knew i would have to say goodbye in a couple of days			0
" the day before the termination , @entity190 found a red marker and drew a heart on his wife 's stomach			0
" i knew our baby was in there , and i was showing him that i love him , " he said			0
" it was our last night with him			0
" this kind of emotion is one of the reasons why the @entity47 has decided so far not to interview families like the @entity22			0
" it 's very intrusive to start knocking on doors of people who 've had a pretty major trauma in their lives , " @entity105 said			0
" that 's the lamest excuse i 've ever heard , " said @entity190 , reflecting the viewpoint of several families interviewed by @entity212 whose children have neural tube defects			0
" we want to talk to them , " he said			0
" we 'd do anything to help find out why our baby died and help other families			0
we do n't want anyone else to go through what we 've been through			0
" @entity105 said it 's not clear what investigators would ask these parents			0
the medical records review showed they had nothing obvious in common			0
" unless we really think we 're going to learn something that will help us prevent neural tube defects , we 've said that that 's not the route to go yet			0
" all the @entity22 can do now is grieve without answers			0
a few weeks after they terminated the pregnancy , the couple found outthat their baby had been a boy			0
they named him @entity238 and got tattoos in his memory			0
@entity190 's tattoo on his collarbone has a baby 's hand and the letters @entity246 , for " @entity247			0
" @entity0 's tattoo on the inside of her wrist has the same baby hand			0
" @entity253 , " it reads			0
