you feel happiness all the way down to your genes , scientists say			1
but the kind of happiness you 're feeling matters , as different kinds can have wildly different effects on your physical well - being			1
in fact , the happiness you get from instant gratification -- eating that giant cupcake or buying that fabulous pair of shoes -- may have the same physical impact on your genes as depression or stress , according to a groundbreaking study published in the @entity23			1
" i 've been studying the physical and psychological impact of positive emotion for 20 years , ( and ) the pattern of results we found with this study completely surprised me , " said the lead author , @entity24			1
@entity24 is a professor of psychology and the principal investigator of the @entity34 and @entity35 at the @entity36			0
" i 've known anecdotally that positive emotions impact us on a cellular level , but seeing these results have given us proof that there is a real difference in the kinds of happiness we feel and its potential long - term consequences			1
" how shopping makes you happy the experts divide well - being into two different types : hedonic and eudaimonic			2
these are fancy words to describe happiness that comes from two different sources			2
@entity55 well - being comes from an experience a person seeks out that gives them pleasure			1
as study co-author @entity64 describes it , it 's " having lots of positive experiences that come from , say , eating great food or smelling beautiful flowers			1
" @entity68 well - being is a kind of happiness that comes not from consuming something but from a sustained effort at working toward something bigger than you			1
in other words , it 's working toward a sense of meaning in your life or contributing to some kind of cause			2
think of the happiness you see on the @entity84 or @entity86 's face			2
while the two kinds of happiness are conceptually different , they can and do influence each other , so it has been hard for scientists to measure which kind has had a greater positive influence on someone 's physical or psychological well - being			1
9 simple steps to happiness @entity64 , a professor of medicine , psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at @entity100 , studies the biological pathways by which social environments influence gene expression			2
" i know what misery looks like on a genetic level , " @entity64 said			0
" i can look at white blood cells and see a physical response to stress and misery , but we knew very little about how -- if at all -- positive psychology gets disseminated to the body			2
that 's what this study does			2
" if you experience misery and stress , your genes react to it			0
essentially , there is an increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and a decreased antiviral response			0
people who are subjected to long periods of stress have white blood cells that make slightly more pro-inflammatory proteins on a constant basis			0
inflammation is the first line of defense against infection , so that would be a very useful kind of protein to have ; however , something that causes your body to create inflammation over a sustained amount of time can cause collateral damage to healthy tissue			0
@entity146 microbiologist @entity145 , who is not affiliated with the study but is familiar with its contents , explains it this way : " the immune system of someone stressed out is not at the normal level of green on the terrorism alert scale			2
instead , it 's on yellow or orange , if not all the way on red			0
so there 's this low level of constant inflammation , which is not healthy			0
" use your money to buy happier time low levels of inflammation can cause exhaustion			0
they also increase a person 's risk for cancer , heart disease and @entity174 's and can damage various tissues wherever the white blood cells are causing inflammation where they should n't be , @entity145 said			0
with this understanding in mind , the scientists in the new study took blood from 80 healthy adults who were screened for the two types of happiness			1
none of them reported being depressed or stressed			0
scientists extracted the @entity189 from their blood and took a closer look at the inflammatory and antiviral responses			0
the study found that people who experienced the well - being that comes from self - gratification had high inflammation and low antiviral and antibody gene expression , a result similar to what people who are depressed or experience great stress have			1
cheerfulness may hold back female leaders the people who found happiness by pursuing a greater good had a lower level of this inflammatory gene expression and strong antiviral and antibody gene expression			1
bottom line ? happiness that comes from working for the greater good has a much more positive genetic impact			1
" keep in mind positives go with both kinds of well - being , " @entity24 said			0
" but emotions you feel today ... really will effect who you are at a cellular level			0
" the study did n't get at why the two kinds of well - being have different genetic impacts , but @entity64 has a theory			1
" hedonic well - being is dependent on your taking self - involved action to constantly feed this positive emotion machine , " he said			1
" if something threatens your ability to seek out this kind of personal happiness -- if you get injured , for instance , or you experience a loss -- your entire source of well - being is threatened			1
you are living closer to the edge of that kind of stress			0
" but if you find well - being in the connections you have to others and in pursuing something that involves collaborating with other people , if in that circumstance you get sick or injured or suffer a personal loss , that community you 've worked so hard to connect to , they will help you get through			0

@entity55 well - being is a happiness from instant gratification
@entity68 well - being is a happiness that comes from working toward greater good
working toward the greater good has more positive impact physically , study finds
