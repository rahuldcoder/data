horrific images of dozens of mutilated children 's corpses in the village of @entity4 prompted a rare moment of unity on sunday from the @entity8 @entity7			2
children shot , knifed , axed to death in @entity13 's @entity4 massacre , reports say even @entity14 , the staunchest defender of the @entity13 regime on the council , signed on to a statement that condemned the @entity13 government for its " outrageous use of force against ( the ) civilian population			1
" what is @entity24 ? but few @entity26 watchers predict the atrocities in @entity4 will break the diplomatic deadlock that has cemented itself around @entity13 for the last 15 months			1
" nobody can see these images and not react , " said @entity29 , a veteran analyst of the @entity31 world who lectures at the @entity32 in @entity33			0
" the problem is no one has figured out an effective way to get involved and bring this conflict to an end			2
" as part of a ruthless campaign to crush what started out as a peaceful protest movement , president @entity42 's security forces shelled cities , carried out systematic torture in prisons , and opened fire on opposition demonstrations and funerals			0
the @entity53 has repeatedly accused @entity42 's regime of carrying out crimes against humanity			2
@entity57 meets @entity13 president @entity42 as crisis reaches ' turning point ' it did not take long for @entity63 governments to call for @entity42 's ouster			1
but nearly 15 months after the uprising began , opponents have been unable to formulate a plan to dislodge the family that has ruled @entity13 for more than 40 years			1
" we do n't have any idea how to make these guys go away , " conceded a high - ranking @entity63 diplomat based in the region , who spoke to @entity72 on condition of anonymity			1
" @entity78 , " the diplomat added			2
" in the immediate future , there is not going to be a @entity63 intervention in @entity13			1
" as the body count in @entity13 mounted over the last year to more than 9,000 killed , many @entity13 opposition members began calling for military intervention along the lines of the @entity87 bombing campaign against @entity89 's now - deceased strongman @entity88			1
@entity91 's reign defined by violence but analysts agree the @entity95 public has little appetite for involvement in another @entity26 conflict , as @entity99 has struggled to wind down lengthy wars in @entity101 and @entity102			1
unlike @entity89 , where a number of high - level officials abandoned @entity88 's regime , the @entity13 government has succeeded in maintaining discipline at the highest government levels , even as it has been forced to cede entire towns and villages to the rebels			1
" partly it 's @entity113 solidarity , " said @entity29 , who was referring to @entity42 's @entity113 minority sect , which holds a disproportionately large number of positions in the security forces and in government			0
" partly , these people all have blood on their hands and they sink or swim together			0
if they try to break away , their families will get killed or shot			0
it 's a combination of terrorism and solidarity			0
" " the biggest problem is the regime in @entity13 is not that weak , " argued @entity128 , a @entity99 - based analyst with the @entity129			1
" they still have a critical mass supporting them : the @entity136 merchants , who see the world is not doing anything and that @entity42 can get away with murder			0
" should the @entity95 ' airdrop ' millions of phones into @entity13 ? while the rebellion has roiled through second - tier cities as well as broad swaths of countryside , @entity13 's economic powerhouse cities -- @entity147 and @entity148 -- have largely remained under government control			1
also , unlike @entity88 , @entity42 has powerful regional allies in his corner : @entity152 , @entity14 , and , to an extent , @entity154			0
exploring the @entity14 - @entity13 link " the @entity157 administration does n't really want a clash with @entity14 , @entity154 , or @entity152 in @entity13			1
that would negatively impact oil prices ( in an election year ) , " said @entity128			0
" overall , the strategy coming from the @entity163 is procrastinate , try to emphasize the diplomatic initiative , talk about helping the opposition , but do not really ratchet up rhetoric into full confrontation with @entity14 and @entity152			0
" after initially rejecting armed rebellion against the government , the @entity13 opposition has morphed into a patchwork of loosely coordinated rebel groups determined to bring down the @entity13 president			1
but they have been woefully under - funded and poorly armed			0
for months , demonstrators across @entity13 have chanted , " arm the @entity176 " at protests that are filmed and then distributed around the world via @entity179			1
over the past month , there have been signs that the rebels have gotten their hands on new sources of weapons , though no government will publicly admit to arming the fighters			0
recently , the leader of a rebel band called the @entity190 in northern @entity13 confirmed to @entity72 that the prices for rifles and ammunition had dropped in half			1
timeline : @entity13 -- how a year of horror unfolded early monday morning , the @entity190 's commander , who goes by the nom - de - guerre " @entity198 , " claimed to have carried out an attack in coordination with other rebel groups against the town of @entity204 near the northern city of @entity147			1
" we burned the town 's police station and the city hall in order to force the security and armed forces out of this area , " @entity198 said in a phone interview from the battlefield , as gunshots and explosions could be heard in the background			0
but rebel fighters and residents said the government retaliated with armored vehicles , artillery and rocket fire from helicopter gunships			0
as always , civilians paid the greatest price			0
" as the regime 's artillery was shelling our town , our home was destroyed and me and my brother were seriously injured , " said @entity228			2
he spoke to @entity72 by telephone from a hospital in @entity236 , where he fled with his brother and five other wounded @entity204 residents early monday morning			0
hours later , @entity240 said doctors pronounced his brother @entity242 dead			0
" now i 'm in the hospital filling out paperwork after my brother 's death , " @entity228 said			0
the growing specter of a civil war in @entity13 clearly has policymakers worried			1
" there 's genuine concern about it turning into a huge - scale civil war with no way to influence the outcome or pick the winner , " said the @entity63 diplomat			1
opinion : only @entity14 , @entity154 can stop the carnage the @entity13 government blames @entity261 - linked groups for a series of devastating suicide bombings targeting the headquarters of security forces in @entity148 and @entity147			1
recently , even some of the secular activists who participated in the first waves of protests against @entity148 expressed concern about @entity272 elements cropping up within the armed opposition			0
" last week i was driving out of the city and two armed guys with long beards stopped me and asked me whether or not i pray , " said @entity274 , a teacher from the southern city of @entity276 , who asked only to reveal his first name for security reasons			2
" we do n't want our revolution to transform into armed gangs that are out of control			2
" " i 'm scared of those who say they are rebels and then start to appear alongside the protesters , but then start dirty business like kidnapping people for ransom , " a female student from @entity288 recently told @entity72 , on condition of anonymity			0
opposition groups are clearly concerned about damage to their international image			0
at a recent weekly protest in the northern town of @entity303 , demonstrators performed a choreographed demonstration holding up letters from the @entity307 alphabet that spelled out the sentence : " we are not terrorists			0
" one of the only measures that rival members of the @entity7 have been able to come to agreement on was the deployment of hundreds of @entity315 observers to @entity13			1
the mission was denounced from the start by opposition groups			0
they accused @entity8 special envoy @entity57 of brokering a cease - fire that gave the @entity13 government diplomatic cover for more killing			1
" the plan had a lot of deficiencies , but it was the only plan that the @entity13 and the @entity14 would agree to , " said @entity29 , of the @entity32			1
" the monitors are just monitors , they are not peacekeepers			0
they have been an easy but i think unfair target			0
" @entity57 calls for accountability the much - maligned monitoring mission does not have the numbers or the weapons to force @entity13 combatants to stop fighting			2
it did , however , play a vital role revealing the terrifying scale of the @entity4 massacre , which left at least 49 children under the age of 10 dead			0
the @entity13 government routinely prevents international news organizations like @entity72 from reporting in @entity13 and thereby being able to verify accounts of fighting and casualties			2
and as the @entity13 government and rebels accused each other of killing the children , the @entity8 observers visited @entity4 and swiftly published a report that concluded the @entity13 army fired artillery and tanks into the town			2
@entity13 's ambassador to the @entity8 later responded by accusing some @entity7 members of launching a " tsunami of lies " against @entity148			2
there appears to be no immediate end in sight for @entity13 's grinding war of attrition			1
neither @entity42 nor his allies show any signs of backing down , and @entity42 's opponents are unwilling to risk direct intervention			2
some analysts argue the current bloody stalemate is better than allowing @entity13 to become the battleground in a regional proxy war			1
" this idea that somehow if the @entity375 intervenes , it will stop things from getting worse seems naive , " said @entity128 , the director of the @entity236 project at the @entity129			2
" it 's a bad situation , but its not as bad as it would be if you had a proxy war erupt between @entity152 and @entity380 in @entity13 , or between @entity152 and @entity236 in @entity13			1
that would be a full - bore @entity383 confrontation			0
" @entity95 's regional allies @entity236 and @entity380 are majority @entity386 countries that increasingly find themselves at odds with @entity388 throughout the @entity26			1
the @entity63 diplomat was left hoping for what he called " a game - changer " -- a coup or an assassin 's bullet that would bring down the @entity13 president			1
but , he conceded , " that 's what we hoped would happen for more than 10 years to @entity399			0

" we do n't have any idea how to make these guys go away , " a diplomat says of regime
" in the immediate future , " he adds , " there is not going to be a @entity63 intervention in @entity13 "
