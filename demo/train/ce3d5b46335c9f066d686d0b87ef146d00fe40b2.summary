@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's not just t - t - t - telephones for @entity5			1
the mega-famous pop star came to the @entity7 on thursday to announce a new line of cameras and photo printers with @entity11 , where she is officially the " creative director			1
" @entity11 " really let me put my hands in there and design this s --- myself , " she said			1
@entity11 's @entity17 product line , which is n't available yet , will feature sunglasses with a camera embedded in them , a camera that shoots digital and @entity11 images and a portable photo printer that @entity5 says she takes to bars with her -- in her purse			1
" i suppose many of you are nerdy enough to carry around a mobile printer , " she said , acknowledging the technophiles in attendance			2
" i know i will			0
" wearing sunglasses , a black dress and a dark veil , @entity5 looked somewhat like @entity32 at a funeral as she took a picture of the audience and printed it on the new @entity11 printer , which creates 3 - by - 4 - inch images that look like classic polaroids			1
video : watch @entity5 introduce camera - equipped sunglasses " smile ! you 're so f --- ing famous ! " she said , snapping the shot			1
" oh no , wait , i just took a photo of @entity44			0
" the presentation took place at @entity11 's booth on the trade show floor at @entity7			1
@entity44 -- a competitor -- had a booth and large ads set up within view			0
the @entity54 image - capturing sunglasses , which are a protoype , store photos on a chip in the earpiece of the glasses			2
@entity5 said she had a heavy hand in designing the frames , which sat on a gold mannequin during the short presentation			1
the over-size glasses covered a good half of the mannequin 's face , coming almost down to its lips			2
" you can come to one of my shows and wear them , " she said			0
" take pictures of me dancing on stage			0
" the @entity76 printer , available for $ 150 in march , connects to phones via @entity78 , allowing for on - the - go prints			1
( it does n't work yet for the @entity81 , a fact that , when revealed by @entity5 , got boos and cheers from the audience )			1
what ces devices interest you the most ? share your thoughts the @entity90 camera , which will be out by the holiday season , takes both digital and @entity11 prints			1
a future version will connect to the internet so the shots can be uploaded to social media sites			2
this version does not , she said			0
" i think it 's sexy , it 's sleek and it 's hearty , " she said			2
" it 's not heavy but it feels good in your hand			0
" in working on the @entity106 line , @entity5 said @entity11 asked her what she thought the camera of the future would be			1
" this is ! " she recalls responding , holding up her @entity110			0
the new printer is intended to cater to this cell - phone - photo crowd			0
but many websites and apps now convert smartphone photos with filters , making them look like old - school polaroids or like they 've been taken with toy cameras			0
those can be printed on any other available photo printer , although not always on - the - go			0
some techie attendees at @entity7 waited more than an hour to see @entity5 's announcement , and at least a few started to grow restless when she took the stage more than 40 minutes late			1
while some of them booed the empty stage , others stood anxiously , holding their cell phone - cameras in the air for minutes at a time			0
but @entity5 was n't first to take the stage			2
that was @entity11 chairman @entity132 , who was greeted by boos from the audience			2
he did n't seem to mind			0
" this will be very quick because i know you do n't want to listen to me , " he said .			0
