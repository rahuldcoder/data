-- @entity1 was prepared for chemotherapy			1
she was prepared to lose her hair and deal with extreme nausea and be hospitalized for months at a time			2
she was even prepared to die -- knowing , with her aggressive form of leukemia , that death was a very real possibility			0
but when death did n't come , @entity1 was officially labeled a cancer survivor			1
and she was n't at all prepared for what came next			0
@entity13 forced the mother of two through menopause , leaving her hormones reeling			0
stress and self - doubt created problems with her husband of 24 years			1
she also suffered from vaginal stenosis , a narrowing of the vaginal passage so severe that intercourse was impossible			0
as her primary care physician explained , she was basically a @entity28 : born again virgin			0
" i was 49 when i was diagnosed , 50 when i received my ( bone marrow ) transplant , " said @entity1 , who asked not to be identified by her full name due to the personal details she 's revealing			0
" i was n't ready to give up on a very important part of my well - being -- that being my sexuality			1
" there are 13.7 million cancer survivors living in the @entity39 ; the @entity40 estimates there will be 18 million by 2022			1
survivors face many long - term effects of treatment , from secondary cancers to cardiovascular problems to cognitive defects			1
but the debilitating effects on a patient 's sexuality are often ignored , said @entity51 , director of the sexual health program at the @entity53 in @entity54			1
@entity51 's program is one of a handful of sexuality - focused survivorship programs that have popped up at cancer centers around the country			1
@entity51 was inspired to start the program when she realized many of her patients -- adult survivors of pediatric cancers -- were struggling with sexual issues and had no idea where to go for help			1
radiation , chemotherapy , hormone therapy and surgery all have the capacity to affect sexual function significantly , @entity51 said			1
in one study , young breast cancer survivors reported skin sensitivity , vaginal dryness , genital pain , premature menopause , fertility issues and extreme fatigue			1
their scores on a sexual health test were also lower than the general population 's , indicating problems with sexual desire , arousal , attaining orgasm and relationship satisfaction			1
these symptoms are common for cancer patients , @entity51 said			1
men face many of the same issues in addition to erectile dysfunction			1
the side effects do n't stop when treatment stops			1
@entity51 and her colleagues recently completed a study of 200 young adult cancer survivors ; a significant number of them talked about long - term sexual problems years after their therapies were complete			1
imagine dealing with all the normal teenage development changes on top of dealing with cancer			1
many pediatric cancer survivors feel uncomfortable even dating , @entity51 said			1
adult cancer survivors can also be apprehensive about the bedroom : hormonal changes from chemotherapy and radiation often lower a patient 's sex drive			1
and many face self - confidence issues post-treatment			1
right next to the wigs and prosthetics in @entity53 's patient store are vibrators and lubricants , which @entity51 said helps normalize the " personal products " she advocates using			0
@entity51 works with a team of doctors to provide whatever services her patients need , whether it 's couples therapy or education on vaginal health after early menopause			1
@entity51 's program helped @entity1 understand what had happened to her sexuality -- both physically and mentally			2
" she not only provided us with the emotional tools to overcome the changes we experienced , she also encouraged me to use ' tools ' to help my body get its groove back , " @entity1 said			2
" i will often joke that i never expected vibrators to be prescribed			0
but they were absolutely necessary			0
" behind closed doors most of @entity51 's patients are simply grateful to learn that there 's nothing wrong with them or their relationships			0
although studies have shown sexuality plays an important role in happiness and quality of life , it 's not something doctors discuss often , @entity51 said			2
" we live in a culture that does not support or facilitate honest and frank conversations about sex anyway , " she said			0
" lots of people assume that because no one says anything about it , this is just the price that they have to pay			0
" no one knows about @entity39 's behind - closed - doors policy on sex better than @entity172 , co-author of " @entity174 : @entity175 , " and founder of @entity177 , the world 's largest in - home party company specializing in bedroom accessories			1
as an advocate for sexual health awareness , @entity172 often does group presentations			2
usually she conducts a 20 - minute question - and - answer session at the end of her talk			2
several years ago , a group of young cancer survivors held her captive with questions for more than two hours			1
" women that are 19 and 20 years old , who never had that first sexual experience -- doctors telling them ( to buy ) bedroom toys to stimulate so atrophy would n't set in , " @entity172 remembers			1
they asked , " @entity172 , what does that mean ? " that was the start of @entity200			0
consultants from the company meet with cancer survivors to talk about combating dryness with lubricants and using other toys to enhance sexual pleasure			1
" it has a lot to do with education , " @entity172 said			0
" it 's so important to provide a safe platform where women can ask questions			0
" @entity172 teaches her employees not to sugarcoat anything			0
it 's a long journey , she said , and each cancer survivor needs to learn to stand up for herself ; sexuality ca n't be a dirty word			1
" you truly have to be your own disciple , " she said			0
" women will demand when it comes to our children or our significant others , but we do n't demand for our bodies			0
" a return to intimacy @entity1 's husband was a " trouper " through her cancer treatment , she said , but the couple had difficulty reconnecting in the bedroom			2
with her symptoms , her husband had trouble keeping an erection out of fear of hurting her			0
she remembers thinking , " he must be so traumatized			0
... he only sees me now as a frail being and not as the woman i used to be			0
" cancer can test any relationship , said @entity0 's sex expert @entity247			2
it 's not uncommon for cancer patients to become depressed and question their life path , he said , which a partner can find hard to relate to			2
" ultimately , of course , when you 're in the midst of a battle of cancer , you really are focused on survival , " he said			2
" but as you resume your life , you want to resume all aspects of your life			0
and sexuality becomes a key factor			2
" @entity247 recommends couples start slow : act like two people in love again , instead of patient and caregiver , by going out on date nights and cuddling in front of the fire			0
make your sexuality an ongoing conversation , he said			2
your newfound intimacy might not necessarily be sex in the way it once was -- you have to find a new version of sex that works for you			0
" recovering from cancer , you 're often not talking about weeks or months , " @entity247 said			2
" you 're talking about years			0
" @entity1 has been in remission since march 2009			0
she 's adjusting to life as a survivor , volunteering at @entity53 to help others who are dealing with similar emotional scars			2
" i 'm striving to get back on track with normalcy , " she said , " in every facet of my life			0
