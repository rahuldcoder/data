-- many assumed that the weekend before the debut of " @entity3 " would be a calm one at the box office , but that was not the case			1
@entity8 's thriller " @entity7 " surged into the top spot this weekend and shattered all expectations with a massive $ 36.4 million debut			1
the film , produced by " @entity14 " mastermind @entity13 , cost only $ 3 million to make , and because its marketing campaign was predominantly digital ( read : inexpensive ) , the micro-budgeted film will become a hugely profitable release for the currently on - fire @entity8			2
" @entity7 " had an intriguing premise : for one night every year , all crime ( including murder ) is legal			1
@entity8 's marketing team effectively communicated that twisted plot in trailers and ads , and the premise helped pack theaters , though it did n't deliver on audiences ' high expectations			2
crowds issued the film a discouraging " c " cinemascore grade , and the film sank 38 percent from friday to saturday — a sign of poor word - of - mouth			0
" @entity7 " gave star @entity34 his best opening weekend ever — trouncing " @entity35 " 's $ 22.6 million debut in 2001			1
@entity37 also thrived on the indie circuit this weekend , as his film " @entity42 " scored $ 585,000 from just 52 locations for an early $ 1.5 million total			2
" before midnight " 's robust $ 11,243 per theater average trailed only one other film in the @entity45 : " @entity7 , " which had a sizzling $ 14,353 average at its 2,536 locations			1
@entity0 : the four emotional stages of watching ' @entity7 ' @entity8 reports that audiences for " @entity7 " were quite diverse , with @entity51 moviegoers making up 33 percent of ticket buyers			1
interestingly , the film also played predominantly to women , who accounted for 56 percent of the audience			0
another @entity8 film held strong in second place			1
" @entity60 " decelerated by a healthy 44 percent to $ 19.8 million and has now earned $ 203 million total after three weekends			1
the $ 160 million sequel is just days away from surpassing " @entity63 " 's $ 209 million domestic cume , and with $ 584.6 million globally , it will soon race past @entity63 's $ 626.1 million worldwide total			0
notably , " @entity60 " gave star @entity66 his 16th straight week in the @entity67			1
last weekend 's surprise breakout " @entity69 " worked some more box - office magic in its second weekend			1
@entity72 's $ 80 million thriller declined just 34 percent to $ 19.5 million , giving the magician thriller a $ 61.4 million total after 10 days			0
with a few more weeks of sturdy holds like this , " @entity69 " could become an impressive $ 100 million hit			1
@entity0 : 20 scariest movies of all time @entity82 's @entity81 / @entity80 comedy " @entity83 " opened in fourth place with $ 18.1 million , a somewhat tepid result from the duo that helped " @entity88 " debut with $ 33.9 million back in 2005			1
@entity89 , which is featured throughout the film , is likely used to better launches			0
while " @entity83 " did exceed @entity82 's modest expectations , its mild $ 5,377 per theater average and the looming competitor " this is the @entity95 " may hurt its box office longevity			1
on the bright side , the $ 58 million comedy did earn a " b + " cinemascore grade from audiences , which were split 50/50 between males and females and were 61 percent above the age of 25			0
spending one final weekend in the @entity104 was @entity105 , which dipped only 27 percent ( the smallest drop in the @entity67 ) to $ 12.1 million			2
after three weekends , the $ 100 million animated film has earned $ 84.2 million			0
the purge -- $ 36.4 million 2			0
@entity60 -- $ 19.8 million 3			2
now @entity69 -- $ 19.5 million 4			2
the internship -- $ 18.1 million 5			0
@entity105 -- $ 12.1 million in milestone news , " @entity113 " passed the $ 200 million mark			0
thanks to the @entity117 - directed film ' $ 11.7 million weekend , @entity114 has now earned $ 200.1 million domestically , and it 's running a tad behind 2009 ′ s " @entity119 , " which had earned $ 209.3 million at the same point in its run			2
in limited release , @entity124 's @entity123 adaptation " @entity125 " fared very well in five theaters , earning $ 183,000 — enough for a $ 36,600 per theater average			0
