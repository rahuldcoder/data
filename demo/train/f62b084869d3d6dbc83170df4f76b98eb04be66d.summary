-- the royal baby is great news for @entity3 and @entity4 , but is it also good news for @entity8 tourism ? it 's certainly a popular argument with fans of the @entity8 monarchy -- that the institution raises @entity8 's profile overseas and helps to boost tourist visits			1
the @entity16 newspaper clearly hopes for such an effect from the recent arrival of the third in line to the @entity8 throne			1
" royal baby could cause tourism surge as well - wishers flock to @entity8 , " the paper trumpeted just after the birth of the new prince of @entity25			1
" as @entity32 wakes up to the aftermath of a giant party on the @entity35 and the announcement that the @entity37 and @entity4 have a son , there are hopes that the birth of the new royal baby will spark a tourism boom as well - wishers flock to the @entity8 to share in the joy , " @entity8 's second best - selling paper went on in its picture - rich splash			1
" the spell cast by the monarchy 's 1,000 - year history , combined with the international media frenzy around the royal baby , is extremely powerful at drawing people to @entity53 , " @entity45 , chair of the tourist body @entity46 , is quoted as saying not alone the @entity16 was n't alone in predicting such an effect			1
" hotels and attractions " in @entity32 were set to capitalize on the " royal baby boom , " observed the @entity58			2
and that boom was apparently resonating beyond @entity32			0
" @entity62 to spark rise in tourist visits , " read an @entity61 headline			2
" royal attractions in @entity67 are expecting a surge in visitor numbers as tourists flock to share in the baby joy , " the article said			2
yet further afield ( although still in a @entity74 country ) the travel editor of the star , in @entity75 , was not " necessarily gung ho " about the royal family but he still devoted a blog post to the " bounce " it was sure to give @entity8 tourism			1
on social media , " a @entity8 royal baby could spark a major boost to the @entity8 tourism industry , " was a typical comment from @entity84			1
where 's the evidence ? looking for evidence for the widely touted princeling - tourism connection , the evidence becomes less clear			2
certainly tourists flocked to @entity95 in advance of the birth , awaiting confirmation of the baby 's arrival			2
" our holiday was booked months ago , so we did not expect to be over here while the baby was happening [ but we 've ] been told to bring back as many newspapers and souvenirs with the baby on as possible , " @entity101 and @entity102 , from @entity103 , told the @entity104			0
a scan of social media reveals the odd international prince - fixated quote , such as this from a tweeter in @entity117 , @entity118 : " dear @entity4 , please wait to have the @entity62 until thursday			0
thank you , @entity120 , an @entity122 tourist			2
" but are there any hard numbers to support the idea of a baby - born tourist surge ? the @entity16 did cite a statistical precedent			1
in 2012 , it said , the @entity129 year , tourist visits ( at 31 million ) were at their highest level since the beginning of the economic downturn in 2008			2
however , even if hotels near @entity136 are throwing caution to the wind with " tot - ter around @entity136 " shop - and - stay packages and converting luxury suites into five - star nurseries for the occasion , that still does n't turn correlation into cause			0
negative effect ? if anything , the numbers point the other way			0
a recent story in the @entity151 refers to a document obtained under @entity154 legislation from @entity46 on the marriage between prince @entity156 and @entity157 in 1986			0
" we find that across the year as a whole there were 4 % fewer visitors to @entity8 than in 1985 , but that in july [ 1986 ] there were 8 % fewer than in july of 1985 , " the document says			1
" [ s ] uch as it is , the evidence points to royal weddings having a negative impact on inbound tourism			1
" @entity168 , chief executive office of the campaign group @entity169 , concurs			0
the argument that royal births , weddings and anniversaries benefit tourism is " a complete fiction , " he tells @entity0			1
" there 's not a shred of evidence for it			0
people do n't make holiday decisions on the basis of who 's living in what castle			0
" tourists are here for our culture , our common language			0
they may come and look at palaces but the fairy tale side of it is there regardless of whether the monarchy is or not			0
" people have nothing [ substantive ] to say in defense of the monarchy so come up with a financial argument			0
" culture and heritage " we know that visitors drawn to @entity8 by the appeal of our culture and heritage spend over Â £ 4.5 billion annually and support around 100,000 jobs , " a @entity46 official tells @entity0			1
" this in part can be attributed to attractions and events with a connection to @entity8 's monarchs past and present			1
" @entity4 and @entity3 's wedding in 2011 , @entity46 says , " brought record numbers of visitors for the summer opening of @entity95			0
more than 600,000 people passed through the gates to see the duchess of @entity25 's wedding dress			0
" that smashed the previous attendance figure set in 1994 and was an increase of almost 50 % " on the previous year , says @entity46			0
but whether anybody actually booked tickets to @entity8 for the birth of @entity62 or any other royal event , as so many people in @entity8 and beyond seem to think , is far less certain .			1
