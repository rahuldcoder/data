-- it 's shaping up to be a huge week for @entity2			1
on monday , the company announced its surface tablet platform at a hush - hush event in @entity6 , and now @entity2 has unveiled @entity7 at its @entity8 in @entity9			1
@entity2 announced eight specific platform updates for its upcoming mobile os. we 've already covered one of the most consumer - facing updates , the new @entity16 , but other changes include hardware - related features like multi-core processor and memory card support , a revamped @entity21 , shared native code between @entity7 and @entity23 , @entity25 support , a new wallet hub , @entity27 , and @entity28 for business			1
many of these updates should n't come as a surprise , considering all the leaks and reports that came out in february			0
nor was today 's announcement a full - fledged reveal like @entity37 's @entity36 presentation at @entity38			1
@entity2 says it will unveil more end - user features in the summer			1
but in the meantime , these platform updates are significant , and @entity2 had a lot to say about them			1
here 's a deeper dive into what we can expect from @entity28			2
hardware updates as suspected , @entity7 will support multi-core chips			0
it 's a move that will make @entity7 more competitive with the @entity51 and @entity52 handsets , which have been able to check off multi-core support on their spec sheets for quite a while			2
when they launch , @entity7 devices will run on dual - core processors , specifically those from @entity60			1
" the experience that people have had on a single - core will get much , much better as we move to dual - core , " @entity61 , manager of the @entity62 , said at the event			1
@entity28 will also support three screen resolutions			2
( @entity7 7.5 supports just one			0
) the new screen resolutions include wvga at 800 × 480 pixels and a 15:9 aspect ratio ; wxga at 1280 × 769 and 15:9 ; and 720p at 1280 × 720 at 16:9			1
rounding out the hardware story , @entity28 will support microsd card expansion			0
hardware manufacturers can include a microsd slot for users to easily transfer information from device to device			2
" what this enables is that an end user can add a microsd card months after they 've bought a phone and transfer information from @entity89 to phone , and phone to phone , " @entity61 said			2
" we did n't want to deliver this feature until we could do it where it 's easy to use			2
" revamped @entity21 @entity2 showed off a new internet explorer browser for @entity28			1
the new @entity97 10 features @entity98 , an anti-phishing filter that uses data from @entity102 pcs to block malicious websites in real time			2
@entity61 showed off how @entity21 can protect users who might fall victim to scam links sent via email			0
@entity97 10 also receives a javascript update — @entity110 is now four times faster than the browser in @entity112 7.5 , according to the company			0
there 's also twice as much @entity116 support			2
how does mobile ie 10 compare to other mobile browsers ? according to recent @entity120 scores that measures a browser 's @entity110 execution performance , @entity97 10 performed the best			2
shared native code @entity28 will share native c and @entity126 code with @entity23 , making it easier for developers to create apps for both platforms			0
it 's not something that consumers will immediately notice when they use the os , but @entity2 hopes shared native code will lead to better , faster app development — and thus more quality apps in @entity137			1
" the biggest effect this will have is we 're going to see some freaking killer games this year , " @entity61 said			0
at its developer summit , @entity2 continually hammered on how easy it will be for developers to port games from @entity23 to @entity28 , and vice versa			1
" suddenly , with @entity28 with that shared core , taking an app from the pc to phone is very straightforward , " @entity61 said			1
in essence , native code will enable developers to write high - performance code — which is why games are such a big deal — and drive hardware acceleration			2
" you 're going to see some beefy , powerful phones running some amazing games this year , " @entity61 said			2
@entity158 as suspected , @entity7 devices will support @entity25 sharing			0
@entity25 is n't a totally new technology , but it 's far from ubiquitous , so it 's interesting to see @entity2 pushing it forward			1
@entity61 demoed how @entity25 would work in a @entity165 advertisement with an embedded tag — he used the april issue of @entity168 , actually : with a simple tap of his phone on top of the advertisement , he transferred product information directly to his @entity28			2
also , sharing is n't limited to just phones			0
the new @entity2 platform supports @entity25 between phones , laptops , slates , and pcs. and @entity25 also has an important role in the next platform update ...			1
@entity182 @entity28 will feature a new wallet hub where users can store their credit and debit card information , third - party loyalty and membership cards , and coupons and deals			1
it 's not unlike @entity37 's @entity36 passbook app. but @entity195 experience will also support @entity25 tap - to - pay			1
yes , it 's like @entity197 , but with one fundamental difference			2
all of your credit and debit card information will be stored in a secure sim card , not in an on - device system			1
@entity197 is built directly into a device , making it impossible to move your @entity195 info from one device to the next , but @entity28 has opted for a more transition - friendly option			1
@entity2 's approach is also an experience that carriers prefer			1
but do n't get too excited just yet , as the @entity25 tap - to - pay capabilities wo n't be coming to the @entity213 until next year			0
at launch , the capability will be limited to the @entity218 - based @entity217 carrier			0
@entity213 @entity23 consumers , however , will still be able to access the @entity221 hub as their central location for cards , third - party services , and deals			1
goodbye @entity226 , @entity227 say goodbye to @entity226			0
@entity7 maps will run on @entity27 's mapping technology , built directly into the onboard @entity27 app. there 's not too much news on this front , but this development is n't surprising considering @entity2 and @entity27 's close ties			1
some key features include : @entity238 map data , offline map support , turn - by - turn directions , and map control for developers			1
@entity244 navigation did n't make it			0
@entity28 for business @entity2 has always had a strong hold on the enterprise market with @entity102 , and now it 's taking all of that work and pulling it together with a business - friendly @entity28 platform			1
@entity28 will come with a complete security platform with @entity254 and encryption ( which is a derivative of @entity257 )			0
it 'll make app distribution and deployment flexible for business , offering up a mechanism for private distribution and full - on onsite management			0
businesses will also be able to manage @entity7 devices through a software management system			0
and finally , @entity28 will run the @entity267 — though we have yet to see how it will look in that mobile form			0
new @entity16 ah , the new @entity270			0
" it 's the sexiest thing in @entity28 , " @entity61 said			0
and this should definitely the case for more visually motivated users			0
as we wrote in our story about the @entity270 and current @entity28 devices , the new @entity270 is the most visible end - user feature of @entity28 ( at least that 's been announced so far )			1
@entity2 has taken its @entity278 and made them more customizable , bringing a new small size to the experience			1
" these live tiles are the heart and soul of the @entity28 , " @entity61 said			0
" we know that our users really love their phones , and we think the biggest reason is because @entity288 make the phones so special and so personal			0
" users will be able to choose between a small , medium and large size for their @entity288			0
and now the entire screen is available for @entity294 pinning — the arrow and empty space on the right - hand side have dissapeared			1
to that end , users can pin more on their @entity16			0
and of course , @entity28 and @entity23 are coming even closer together			0
as @entity2 said , they 're " better together			2
" " the intent in our changing the @entity288 support is not just to make @entity288 more personal , but to give a more consistent experience between @entity305 and @entity7 live tiles , " @entity61 said			0
