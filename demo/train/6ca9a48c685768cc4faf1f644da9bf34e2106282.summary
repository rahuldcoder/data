having willfully avoided direct military involvement in @entity2 for the past two years , @entity0 may not be so lucky over the next two			1
reports that @entity4 's forces may have used chemical weapons will almost certainly force the president 's hand into a course of action that takes the @entity10 beyond the humanitarian assistance to refugees and the non-lethal aid and training it 's provided to the rebels			1
what @entity0 does on @entity2 flows directly from what he wants to achieve , or more to the point , what he wants to avoid			1
and in this case , that means a slippery slide toward military involvement in @entity2 that incrementally sucks @entity10 in without a clear sense of an end game			1
indeed , it 's been the president 's inability to see that end state that has been the single greatest constraint on his willingness to become more involved			0
and because that 's no clearer today , @entity0 will look for the least risky and encumbering course of action in @entity2 , and that probably means arming the opposition			1
sadly , this is unlikely to significantly accelerate the demise of the @entity38			0
in march , the president said that @entity4 's use of chemical weapons would be a game - changer , a red line			0
tuesday , he said he needs more evidence before acting			0
" when i am making decisions about @entity10 national security and the potential for taking additional action in response to chemical weapons use , i have to make sure i have the facts , " he said			2
paradoxically , the chemical weapons issue is n't so much a revolutionary departure point for the president as much as it is the impetus for another incremental move in a complicated calculus of how @entity0 tries to find a way to stay out of @entity2			1
and who could blame him ? despite the moral , humanitarian and strategic arguments for intervention , @entity2 is a trap that threatens to suck external powers in and shackle them with responsibility for war - making , peacekeeping and a reconstruction effort that could eventually involve thousands of boots on the ground and billions of dollars in assistance			1
and it 's been clear from the beginning that @entity0 has no intention of getting stuck with the check			2
his calculations are pretty obvious ones			0
having laid the groundwork for taking @entity10 out of wars that have been the two longest and among the most profitless in its history , @entity0 has no intention of getting @entity10 into new ones			1
@entity2 is n't @entity83 , a country without serious defenses , allies and chemical weapons that represents low - hanging fruit for any military planner			2
and @entity0 's priorities reflect the desires of the @entity10 people , which run to fixing @entity10 's own broken house , not chasing around the world looking for others to repair			1
and while 's there 's no evidence to prove this , @entity0 's cautious calculation on @entity2 is probably also driven by @entity100			1
this is n't the conventional notion banging around @entity103 that the best way to weaken the mullahs is to push @entity4 out but the president 's sense that when the moment of decision comes on @entity100 , he 'll need @entity111 and @entity112 support and as much flexibility as possible if he needs to launch military strikes			0
he knows he wo n't get @entity111 support on @entity2 and @entity100			2
and he does n't want to be engaged in military campaigns on two fronts ( and in @entity118 ) if he 's going to war with the mullahs			0
all of @entity0 's calculations have now been challenged by what appears to be @entity4 's use of chemicals			2
and he 's now forced to consider violating his own red line on military action in @entity2			2
the chemical weapons issue challenges him in three ways : first , it undermines his personal credibility			0
if @entity0 declared that the use of chemical weapons would be a game - changer and nothing happens , @entity10 's credibility is lost in the yawning gap between the president 's words and deeds			1
the red line turns pink ; once again , @entity10 's street cred is undermined in a region where power is respected			2
second , if @entity0 does n't impose some cost on the regime , @entity4 may use chemicals again , perhaps this time in a more expansive way			1
the @entity2 have introduced more muscular military tactics against the opposition gradually : first artillery , then air power and then surface - to - surface missiles			1
the alleged use of sarin gas may well be part of that pattern			0
@entity0 must try to break it			0
and third , the world is watching			0
if the president ca n't enforce his own red line on chemicals , what do you think our adversaries ( @entity167 and @entity100 ) and friends ( @entity169 and @entity170 ) will conclude on the nuclear issue ? so the question is not whether to act but how			0
and the answer from @entity0 's perspective is to identify the least risky option			1
if the president wanted to bring down the regime more quickly , he 'd develop a three - pronged strategy to create offensive no - fly zones protecting rebel sanctuaries near the @entity182 and @entity183 borders using @entity185 missile batteries ; proactively suppress @entity2 air defenses ; and then launch air and cruise missile strikes against @entity2 military assets and even leadership targets			1
@entity191 the @entity2 for several weeks			0
but that 's not his inclination or that of his military advisers			0
as recently as tuesday , gen. @entity196 , chairman of the @entity197 , was still being super cautious on a no - fly zone			0
what @entity0 is likely to do -- and the signals from the @entity201 are clearer than ever -- is to begin providing lethal assistance to opposition elements that have been carefully vetted and covert assistance to coordinate delivery and training			1
help the rebels to help themselves and avoid , at least for now , direct @entity10 military intervention			2
the real question is whether the administration is prepared to provide even those " koshered " rebel groups , those without ties to @entity215 extremists and an inclusive approach to the new @entity2 , with the " manpads " : portable surface - to - air missiles and anti-armor weapons in sufficient quantities that might be effective against @entity4 's air and armor			2
there 's a real risk that weapons could end up in the wrong hands , used against @entity10 or other @entity2 opposition groups in the ongoing struggle for @entity2 and between @entity215 and @entity228			1
the fact is , @entity0 has no good options			2
he 'll pick the least worst one , providing some kind of weapons to the rebels			0
that will make us feel better , neutralize the liberal interventionists and conservative republicans who 've been blasting him and respond to those who say he 's backing away from his red line			0
it wo n't turn the tide in @entity2 or necessarily prevent @entity4 from using chemical weapons			0
the other alternatives -- do nothing or design a proactive and comprehensive military strategy to take out the @entity38 -- are n't in the cards			0
but make no mistake : sooner rather than later , the president will likely be faced with another decision point along the slippery slope of @entity10 military intervention in @entity2 .			1

@entity253 says president @entity0 has no good choices on @entity2
he says @entity10 would probably provide arms to elements of the opposition
that is the least risky course but still could mean a slippery slide toward war , he says
@entity253 : @entity0 *rightly* wants to avoid the risks , *bloodshed* , cost of another war
