@entity3 @entity2 sen. @entity1 is on track to run for president in 2016 even if @entity7 also jumps into the race , a source close to @entity1 says			1
the source told @entity4 that a @entity7 candidacy -- increasingly likely after the former @entity2 governor said in a @entity12 post tuesday that he will " actively explore " running -- changes the dynamics of the race " but not @entity1 's thought process			1
" @entity1 has invited supporters to a jan. 23 - 24 retreat in @entity19 , where his top aides and donors could formalize his plans for 2016			2
a run for president would be a big risk for @entity1 , a 43 - year - old former @entity2 @entity26 speaker who looks like a sure bet to win a second term in the @entity29 in 2016			1
he 's making the moves of a presidential contender			0
@entity1 campaigned with @entity33 candidates in the 2014 midterm election			2
he has a memoir set for release in january			0
and he 's working with incoming @entity38 chairman @entity37 ( @entity39 ) to craft health care legislation meant to be an alternative to @entity42			0
he 's also been increasingly vocal on foreign policy issues -- potentially setting up a clash with leading @entity33 contenders like @entity47 sen. @entity46 , who has called for less @entity49 intervention overseas			0
@entity1 , though , would share one problem with @entity7 : he 's championed an overhaul of @entity49 immigration laws , a position that has fallen out of favor with much of the @entity33 base .			1

a source close to sen. @entity1 says he is on track to run for president in 2016
this comes in the wake of *mentor* and former gov. @entity7 saying he 's ' exploring a bid '
the source says @entity7 's entrance changes the race 's dynamics ' but not @entity1 's thought process '
