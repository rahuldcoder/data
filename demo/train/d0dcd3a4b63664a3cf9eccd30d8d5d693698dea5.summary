-- why do we love gangsters -- at least the ones on tv and in the movies ? the sudden death of actor @entity7 at age 51 has brought a round of instant nostalgia for the @entity12 show he led at the turn of the millennium , " @entity16			1
" it helped define the time for people living it , stretching between the excesses of the @entity22 years and the grim patriotic grit of the post- 9/11 period			0
there was very little admirable about the character of @entity27 -- most of us do n't murder on our lunch break -- and yet he became a kind of elevated everyman			2
from the commute home to @entity34 shown in the opening credits -- over the techno - blues of @entity38 3 's " @entity42 ( and got myself a @entity44 ) " -- to @entity27 's constant struggles to keep in control at work , this was a violent fantasy for middle - aged managers who want respect			1
opinion : @entity7 's gift to television -- and @entity51 a half - century ago , cowboys and @entity53 were the quintessential @entity51 set piece for tv and film			1
the pioneer life was still within living memory			0
but since at least the 1970s , with @entity60 's " @entity61 " films , the @entity58 has become our central media metaphor			1
we are a nation of people who live in and around cities , more the descendants of immigrants than @entity69 pioneers			0
the struggle is less for settling land and taming wilderness than it is for money and respect and defense of our family			0
the goal is getting ahead and living the good life			0
gangster fantasies also undercut the old adage that there is no honor among thieves			0
while the @entity16 crew was often a rolling disaster of violent incompetence , @entity27 was the flawed moral anchor of the @entity58 family , trying to instill some values even while acknowledging ( reluctantly , in private ) his own hypocrisy and contradictions			1
what made " @entity16 " different from the boatload of @entity58 shows that came before it was that @entity27 was in therapy			1
the sight of a mobster having an anxiety attack and suffering through psychotherapy was the central conceit of the show , the selling point of the pilot episode that led to the six - season series			2
but if " talking about your feelings " seemed like the least masculine thing you could do , here too @entity27 represented the plight of the modern @entity51 male , reconciling his animal instincts with polite society			1
therapy is where strong silent types get sent to be civilized			0
appreciation : @entity7 , a pure actor good luck			0
part of the appeal of the show was the fantasy of being able to vent frustrations violently			0
" @entity16 " was the anti- " @entity123			2
" while @entity124 and crew fixated on the small annoyances of daily life from the perspective of @entity130 's @entity129 , @entity27 and his crew reacted to the small frustrations of daily life with violence over in @entity34 , punishing the pretentious , dishonest and arrogant with vicious beat - downs and more than a few bullets to the chest			1
they were n't going to be anyone 's nominee for civic leader , and yet the guilty pleasure came from watching oversensitive thugs refuse to take any crap from anybody			1
for middle - aged men , i always suspected that part of the appeal of @entity27 was the archetype he provided that fat men , who eat and drink and smoke too much , can be recognized as central figures rather than side characters			1
overburdened with work and the weight that comes with too many good times under his belt , @entity27 was the patriarch who demanded respect and ultimately received it			1
he was oversexed and had what might be described as @entity161 notions of fidelity , despite his appearance , because " power is the ultimate aphrodisiac " -- and yes , i just quoted @entity166 in a column about @entity27			2
@entity27 's best quotes all of which is to say that @entity27 was not admirable , but was an eminently relatable figure for men who wrestle with the competing pressures of raising a family , running a business and being a man			2
he provided validation for their own mistakes and made them look good by comparison			0
when they struggled with their children , the disrespect @entity27 endured from his two kids made the domestic seem dramatic			2
when the average guys ' own dim - witted bosses , for whom they do all the day - to - day work , tried to undercut them , @entity27 's struggles with @entity187 ( who tries to have him killed ) made their own frustrations seem manageable			1
in the end , having a @entity58 show be a metaphor for daily life does n't exactly reflect a country living up to its best traditions			0
but then the gap between fiction and reality is always stark , especially in the rearview mirror			0
@entity27 mattered to so many people because his struggles were their own , writ large , and he could take decisive actions to demand respect for himself and his family that they could only fantasize about , trying to maintain control and impose something like sanity on all the constantly moving craziness that surrounds us			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			0
