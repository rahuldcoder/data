-- @entity1 , arguably the greatest @entity2 soccer player of all time , has announced his retirement from the game			1
the 32 - year old @entity7 striker , who was also the @entity2 national team 's all time top scorer , made the announcement after scoring the winning goal in the @entity12 match against @entity13 wednesday			1
" after careful deliberation and after many conversations with those closest to me , i have decided that this will be my last season as a professional soccer player , " @entity1 wrote in a statement published on the @entity7 's official website			1
" i feel incredibly blessed and lucky to have played a role in the remarkable growth of @entity23 and @entity24 during my playing career			0
and while my career as a player will soon be over , rest assured i will stay connected on many levels to the beautiful game			0
" @entity1 had become one of the most recognizable @entity2 soccer stars outside of his home country			1
in @entity34 he became something of a cult figure after two successful loan spells at @entity39 side @entity38			0
but it was for a string of incredible performances for the @entity2 national team , and for his partnership with @entity45 whilst both men were at @entity7 , that he will be most fondly remembered			1
he played at both the 2006 and 2010 @entity48 finals			0
whilst every fan will have a favorite moment , be it winning the @entity52 or scoring against @entity53 in the @entity54 , it was his last - minute goal in the 2010 finals against @entity56 that perhaps best defines his career			0
not only did it take the @entity2 into the second round , more importantly , it improbably won them the group ahead of @entity34			2
despite hopes he would shine for the @entity2 team in @entity53 this summer , he was a shock omission from coach @entity66 's squad			2
but , paying tribute to the @entity23 ' all time top scorer , @entity24 president @entity67 hailed @entity1 's contribution to the game 's rise in the @entity2 " when the story of the growth of @entity24 is told , @entity1 will be one of the central figures , " he said			2
" @entity1 achieved unprecedented success as he emerged as the face of @entity24 , and helped bring the game to another level			0
@entity1 himself gave no hint as to his plans in retirement other than helping soccer to continue to put down roots in the @entity2 " as we enter a transformative time for the sport , i will do everything i can to help the continued growth of soccer in the @entity2 , " he said			1
" i look forward to making a difference , pursuing my passions and meeting all of you along the way in this next phase of my life			0
