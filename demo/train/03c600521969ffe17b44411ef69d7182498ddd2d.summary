@entity0 -- it 's coming next week			0
it 'll protect 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation			1
there 's still a lot of uncertainty about president @entity10 's upcoming immigration executive order , since @entity10 himself has yet to make a final decision on an action to fix the broken system			1
but while details are n't yet locked down , there are a few things we know for certain : the move is coming before year 's end , the fate of millions of immigrants are at stake , and @entity24 are fuming			1
here 's what else you should know about the upcoming immigration order : what is @entity10 going to do ? the biggest question -- one the @entity31 is n't ready to answer quite yet -- is what changes @entity10 will bring to the immigration system to make it fairer			1
he vowed to take action on his own earlier this year , saying @entity37 had failed to pass any meaningful reforms themselves			1
administration officials , however , have laid out the contours of a plan : many parents of @entity45 citizens , who are undocumented immigrants themselves , will be allowed to stay and work in the @entity45 legally			1
an estimate from the @entity47 puts the number of undocumented parents who might be eligible -- since they 've been in the @entity45 for 5 years -- at 3.3 million			0
related : the immigration waiting game will end soon other potential areas of reform include extending the deportation deferment for immigrants who were brought to the @entity45 as children			1
@entity10 enacted a rule in 2012 permitting some of those children to avoid deportation , but there were age restrictions			1
changing them could bring hundreds of thousands more into the fold			0
officials also said the plan could include a stronger focus on deporting criminals who are undocumented immigrants and an expansion of worker visas in areas like technology			1
lastly , the plan could include new resources to bolster security on the border			0
what will that actually do for immigrants ? immigration activists have long called for a fix to the system that would end deportations splitting up families			1
thanks to the 14th amendment to the @entity84 , anyone born in the @entity45 is automatically a citizen - that includes children whose parents are undocumented immigrants			1
but this also means many immigrant families find themselves in positions where one or both parents face deportation , while their children are allowed to stay			0
permitting those parents in the @entity45 to work legally and avoid deportation would allow families to remain together			0
president @entity10 has said keeping families together would be part of the reason he 'll acting alone to provide relief from the threat of deportation			1
how many people would be affected by the move remains to be determined , since the details are n't yet finalized			0
if @entity10 announces he 'll allow all undocumented parents of @entity45 citizens , legal permanent residents , or deferred - deportation - eligible kids , 3.7 million people could be affected , according to the @entity47 's report			1
but a stricter policy could bring those numbers down			0
mandating parents live in the @entity45 for at least 5 years before becoming eligible would bring the number affected to 3.4 million ; a 10 - year minimum would bring it down further to an estimated 2.6 million people			0
will it be enough ? even under the broadest interpretation , @entity10 is expected to provide relief to 5 million undocumented immigrants			1
that 's fewer than half the 11.7 million currently thought to be in the @entity45			0
his action would be far less sweeping than a comprehensive bill passed through @entity37			2
it would also be temporary			0
the next president could simply undo the orders and re-start deportations			0
but with @entity37 unlikely to pass a comprehensive bill , @entity10 's action may be the best activists can hope for			1
immigration rights groups have been waiting a long time for @entity10 to pull the trigger on his immigration action			2
first announced this spring , the @entity31 initially said the actions would be in place by the end of the summer			0
politics got in the way when @entity10 pushed the announcement until after this month 's midterm elections			2
now activists say anticipation is high with the waiting game nearing an end			0
but their expectations for @entity10 's final plan are n't exactly sky high			2
" our expectations are n't tempered			0
but we fear that @entity10 's may be , " said @entity152 , deputy vice president of the @entity153			1
@entity154 , the advocacy director at immigrants ' rights group @entity155 , said she expected the eventual announcement to fall somewhere short of the maximum @entity10 could do with his executive power			1
" i think they will try to couch that as ' these are our political constraints , ' " she said			0
what will @entity24 do if @entity10 offers relief to many undocumented immigrants ? impeachment ? as soon as @entity10 announced he was taking unilateral action on immigration , @entity24 denounced him as overstepping his constitutional bounds			1
those cries of overreach do n't show signs of quieting as the announcement nears			0
on the extreme end are calls for impeachment , which were fueled this week when rep. @entity175 , a @entity24 from @entity176 , said @entity10 's moves could spark proceedings in the @entity31			1
@entity179 , a conservative columnist , said thursday night the potential actions are " an impeachable offense			0
" related : immigration action would spur calls for impeachment it 's hard to say exactly how @entity24 will react since the action has n't been announced in any detail			2
but no matter what @entity10 does it 's certain to spark @entity24 outrage			1
house speaker @entity190 said @entity10 was playing with matches and " would get burned " if he went ahead with executive action			2
soon - to - be senate majority leader @entity193 said the president would " poison the well " in terms of working with @entity24 for the final two years of his presidency			1
the lawsuit against @entity10 that @entity31 @entity24 have threatened could be expanded to include the immigration order			1
and any funding required for the plan could be held up in @entity37			2
all that only seems to empower @entity203 , who say the threats demonstrate how resistant the @entity24 is to changing the broken immigration system			2
will it all cause a government shutdown ? it all comes down to timing			0
as @entity10 prepares to unveil the long - awaited immigration action , lawmakers in the congressional lame duck are wading through some important business , chiefly passing a measure that would fund the federal government			2
if the immigration announcement comes before the spending bill is passed , @entity24 could hold it up			2
with funds running out in mid-december , that could trigger another government shutdown			0
to avoid that , @entity24 could pass a short - term spending measure the keeps the government running while they determine their next steps			2
but even some democrats do n't want to take chances -- sen. @entity230 , the outgoing @entity193 , said he wanted @entity10 to wait until after the spending bill passes to make the immigration announcement			0
the @entity31 , meanwhile , has n't given any hints on when the announcement will come , saying the decision wo n't be made until @entity10 returns from his trip to @entity237 this weekend			0
