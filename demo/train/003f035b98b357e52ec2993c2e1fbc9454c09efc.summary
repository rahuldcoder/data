attorney general @entity0 on monday announced new regulations for the more than 200 halfway houses operated by federal contractors , requiring them to provide transportation and allow inmates to use cell phones to reconnect with family and friends , and to start looking for jobs			1
the new regulations also require the half way houses to provide mental and substance abuse treatment to inmates , and are part of @entity0 's " @entity14 " initiative , under which prosecutors are seeking ways to reduce sentences for certain non-violent drug offenders			0
the @entity20 said @entity0 's moves can be at least partly credited for the biggest drop in the federal prison population , a reduction of 4,000 inmates compared to the end of last fiscal year in september			1
federal prisons incarcerate 216,000 people in the @entity30 , which accounts for only 5 % of the world 's population but holds 25 % of its prisoners			0
while states have made moves to cut prison populations , partly due to budget reasons , changes in the federal prison population has lagged for some time			2
the new @entity20 regulations affect contractors that run halfway houses for the @entity44 , which uses such facilities to hold inmates near the end of their sentences as they prepare to transition to life outside prison			2
@entity0 said the changes " will enhance the programs that help prisoners overcome their past struggles , get on the right path , and stay out of our criminal justice system			0
