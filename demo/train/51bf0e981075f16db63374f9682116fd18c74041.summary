-- hailing a taxi in @entity2 is hard enough , what with fighting off other would - be passengers and getting the attention of a swerving , speeding cabbie			1
getting the taxi to drive you from @entity2 to @entity9 ? @entity10			1
at least that 's what the father of @entity13 , a former taxi driver himself , said when he heard about his son 's plan to pay a cab driver $ 5,000 to bring him and his friend @entity18 from the @entity19 to the @entity20 in one trip			1
six days and 3,000 miles later , @entity13 put an exclamation point on the journey with an unadorned post on his @entity26 page : done			1
writing that word might have been easy , but the trek was n't -- at least for @entity29 , the cab driver who left his crying family behind to endure several sleepless nights with a pair of strangers			1
but he made it , with a little help from his new friends			1
one of them , @entity18 -- an @entity37 professor -- explained in a @entity40 video that he did n't hesitate when @entity13 pushed what he " just thought ... was a cool idea			2
" " and so when ( @entity13 ) said i 'm going to do this , are you going to do this with me , i kind of just said yes , knowing that @entity13 has a lot of ideas , " @entity18 said			2
" i just like tagging along			2
" @entity13 , an investment banker , was motivated by a desire to pay tribute to his father			2
but he also admitted online to having @entity52 dreams			0
" at the moment , the running concept is that we 're going to take it to some movie people when we get there and see what happens , " he said to a camera being held by @entity18			0
but they could n't do it alone , not without a real , live @entity2 taxi driver behind the wheel			1
this was going to be hard , as @entity13 learned when he asked one such driver -- who rolled up his window , without bothering to answer			1
after thinking they 'd scored a ride with another cabbie ( who agreed to do it , only to be rebuffed by his boss , according to @entity13 's @entity26 post ) , the two friends found @entity29 at @entity74 , in the @entity76 borough of @entity2 on april 16			1
the three went to @entity29 's home , so the driver could pack some bags and say goodbye to his tearful wife , child and parents			1
convincing them that it made sense for him to go was the first , but hardly the last , major challenge for the @entity90 man			0
" i said , ' no crying			0
i will be fine , " @entity29 told @entity0 affiliate @entity92			0
" i 'll come back very soon			0
" so off they went			0
through @entity95 , into @entity96 , then onto @entity97			0
along the way , they recorded their observations on the ride in 140 - character bursts on @entity26 and using a camera they 'd bought at a @entity106 @entity105 just before heading out			2
by the time they got to @entity109 , @entity110 -- @entity18 's hometown -- @entity29 was exhausted and ready to quit			1
he had driven nearly two days straight without significant rest , refusing to let @entity13 and @entity18 drive the cab because they were not properly licensed			2
his family , back home in @entity2 , still missed him and worried about him			1
@entity13 tried to persuade him to keep going			2
" @entity29 is taking a timeout in my old bedroom , speaking to his wife , trying to get it together , " @entity18 wrote on @entity26			0
" everyone is very tired			0
" after a break , @entity29 changed his mind and the three hit the road again			0
they cruised through the @entity126 and into @entity127 , and then a giddy @entity29 and @entity13 took in the view at the @entity129			0
by friday , they 'd finally arrived in southern @entity131			1
" i can see @entity132 and we just hit traffic ! ! ! we are cruisin in @entity135 , " @entity18 wrote on @entity26 , as the cab rolled through @entity9			1
their mission complete , the two friends said they were n't sure if they would take the taxi back , across the country , to their jobs , their homes , their lives in @entity2			1
@entity29 did n't have much choice , though @entity13 insisted on @entity26 that the cabbie " is not driving by himself anywhere ... he will 100 % have company			2
" for the two friends , the trip was an adventure , a dare and a chance to prove one of their father 's wrong			1
for @entity29 , it was at times a nightmare but also a dream and the chance to make his mark			0
" it 's about the record			0
i want to be a part of the record , " he told @entity92			0
" but , it 's not money			0
i do n't think about money , i told them			0
" while it started as his ideas , @entity13 wrote on @entity26 that he believes the trip meant more to their new friend @entity29 than to anyone else			1
" no one will ever understand how badly @entity29 wanted this , " he said .			0
