-- @entity2 's punishment for his racist remarks was swift and severe			1
it may also be good for business , according to several experts			0
the owner of the @entity8 was slapped with a lifetime ban by the commissioner of the @entity11 on tuesday			1
the blow came after tapes were leaked of him telling his girlfriend he did n't approve of her posting pictures of herself online with black people , adding that he did n't want her bringing them to games			2
@entity2 admits that he made the comments , @entity11 commissioner @entity20 said in announcing that he planned to fine @entity2 $ 2.5 million and force him to sell his team			1
on the recording , @entity2 's girlfriend @entity24 pushes back , asking @entity2 if he realizes that his players are black			1
( through her lawyer , she denied leaking the tape to the media , but said the recording was genuine			0
) @entity24 has a point			0
more than three - quarters of pro basketball players are black , according to a 2013 report by the @entity35 in @entity36 at the @entity37			1
perhaps equally important , basketball fans are disproportionately black , research shows -- which means that racist remarks could hurt the sport 's bottom line			1
some 45 % of television audiences for basketball are black , according to 2013 @entity47 research			1
that 's much higher than for other major @entity50 sports			2
about 15 % of @entity55 fans , 9 % of baseball fans and 3 % of hockey fans are black , @entity47 research shows			2
the country as a whole is just over 13 % black , the @entity56 says			2
" there is a significant market segment of african - americans who identify with the @entity11 and @entity11 players , " said @entity60 , a professor of sports business strategy and marketing at @entity63 in @entity64			1
and it 's not just about the fans turning their back on a sport , he said			2
sponsors were also beginning to distance themselves from the @entity8			2
the auto company @entity74 and the airline @entity75 both announced they were ending sponsorship of the team , as did @entity78 , the second - largest @entity11 advertiser , according to @entity47			1
@entity74 specifically took a stance against racism in its statement monday cutting off its sponsorship			0
" @entity74 finds the statements attributed to the @entity8 ' owner completely unacceptable			0
these views directly conflict with @entity74 's culture of respect for all individuals			2
while we have been a proud @entity8 sponsor for nine years and support the team , fans and community , these statements necessitate that @entity74 end its sponsorship , " the company said			0
and it could have gotten much worse , sports marketing expert @entity94 said			0
" it would have destroyed sponsorship not only with the @entity8 , but with the @entity11			1
there is no way any of these major brands would be associated with a league where this is one of the owners , " said @entity94 , the president of @entity98			0
that 's what prompted the league to act , he said			0
" the owners are n't going to do anything until it hits their bottom line , as much as they dislike " the kind of comments @entity2 made			1
@entity60 calls this " market - driven morality			1
" " it 's not like reading the @entity115 , " he said			0
" essentially corporations are looking at markets , looking at their consumers , and if being associated with a racist , a sexist , a dog fighter is bad business , they increasingly are making commercial decisions on that basis			0
" " commercial partners had already expressed their willingness to bail			0
@entity20 did what he thought was right for the fans , for the customers , but also for the commercial partnerships that were in place , " said @entity60			0
" market - driven morality " is much more advanced in @entity132 than elsewhere in the world , he argued , contrasting the reaction to @entity2 's comments with @entity139 soccer 's failure to stamp out racist abuse of players by fans			1
the same weekend that @entity2 's remarks became public , a banana was thrown at @entity146 soccer star @entity145			1
the racist insult is thought to compare black players to monkeys			1
@entity145 made a joke of it , picking up the banana and eating it , and a @entity154 campaign sprang up in his support , led by his teammate , @entity157 soccer star @entity156			0
but there was no top - down response from @entity161 's @entity160 or world football 's governing body , @entity162			1
@entity162 's long - time head , @entity164 , has been accused by critics of not taking racism seriously enough			1
he suggested in 2011 that racist incidents should be resolved with a handshake , and last year argued against punishing teams for racist behavior by their fans			2
" can we bring an end to violence or racism by docking points or relegating a team ? or would such measures lead people to come to games to get the match abandoned , " @entity164 said in a speech in april 2013 at a meeting of the company @entity180 , with which @entity162 works to fight against match - fixing			0
" we should do all we can but there 's a risk that if we have matches replayed or if we punish clubs on the sporting front , it will open the door to hooligan groups who will come to deliberately cause trouble			0
" @entity164 tweeted support for @entity20 and the @entity11 on wednesday			2
but the @entity11 's response to @entity2 could put pressure on him to act more decisively , @entity60 said			1
" with the @entity199 coming up , it really commits @entity164 to taking action , " he said of the global soccer tournament that starts in @entity157 in june			0
" @entity164 could do this			0
however , i do n't think it 's just a moral decision , it 's a business decision too			0

basketball audiences are disproportionately black , tv surveys show
sponsors were already pulling away from the @entity11 after @entity2 's racist remarks
" market - driven morality " can influence corporate behavior , professor argues
