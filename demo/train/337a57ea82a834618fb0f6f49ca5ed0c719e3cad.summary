-- this month , a federal judge allowed @entity2 to put into effect new laws that would make it more difficult to vote			0
most of the @entity8 public did n't notice			2
the @entity9 pushing to restrict voting rights nationwide are betting on such inattention			1
emboldened by a recent @entity14 case limiting the reach of the @entity16 , @entity9 legislators have moved swiftly in numerous states to cut early voting and same - day registration , and to require @entity21 cards at the ballot box			1
@entity23 claim these measures will discourage young and nonwhite voters from voting , who tend to vote more often for @entity23			2
@entity9 legislators insist they 're only worried about voter fraud and the integrity of the electoral system			1
but there is little evidence of significant fraud			0
and these legislators do n't actually dispute the @entity23 ' basic claim			2
indeed , rigging the rules to dampen turnout among youth and minorities appears to be a key strategy for some @entity9			1
when people complain about the impact of voting restrictions , they 're often dismissed as @entity23 mouthpieces			1
voting rights , to the average citizen , becomes just another partisan football			2
this is bad for the country			0
but it 's particularly bad for the @entity9			1
while it may seem that the @entity9 who want to restrict voting are winning right now , their strategy in fact threatens to isolate the party in the long term			1
@entity9 leaders insist , correctly , that plenty of young , @entity58 , @entity59 , and @entity8 - @entity8 voters respond positively to a message of smaller government and more economic freedom			1
but prior to stances on issues , what voters of color and young voters pick up on is a vibe -- an overall sense of whether we are welcome			0
and the vibe that many in the @entity9 have been sending lately has been less than welcoming			2
consider not just the efforts to invalidate the @entity16 and to restrict access to the ballot , which many @entity78 and african - americans have taken personally , but also the hostility of many @entity9 toward undocumented immigrants			1
consider too the remarks of people like @entity85 congressman @entity84 , who declared recently that president @entity86 and the @entity23 are prosecuting a " war on whites			2
" whipping up the anxieties of older whites may be rational politics -- after all , they are still the likeliest voters -- but it alienates what demographer @entity93 calls " the next @entity94			2
" as @entity96 of the @entity97 recently put it , the @entity9 , having painted itself in a corner , " applied a second coat			1
" i am a @entity100 , so i know my comments will be presumed partisan			0
but i am foremost an @entity94 who is quite conscious of what it took for me , the son of @entity105 immigrants , to get to vote			2
a few weeks ago i met @entity106 , icon of the civil rights movement and longtime @entity109 congressman			0
it happened to be the 50th anniversary of the signing of @entity113 into law			0
i asked him how today 's youth should engage , given that the obstacles and challenges are so different from what he experienced as a teenager			0
his answer was simple : participate			0
this is the moment for a rising @entity9 to deliver precisely that message to people of color and young voters : participate			1
it 's the moment for a leading @entity9 to argue that his or her party should be on the side of more democracy , not less ; more inclusion , not less			1
if there is actual voter fraud , root it out , this leader should say , but not in a way that seems like a whites - only backroom plot			0
sen. @entity143 has shown signs that he could be such a voice			0
he 's met with constituencies that national republicans often ignore , like @entity8 voters and college students			0
his outreach has seemed in earnest , and he has been a refreshing voice on issues like reform of criminal sentencing			0
but telling , also , was the quick getaway he made when an undocumented " dreamer " recently came up to him and another @entity9 congressman to ask them about immigration reform			1
outreach ca n't be only scripted and packaged , it has to come from readiness to engage			0
more importantly , it has to emerge from a sincere belief that more participation is better			0
a party confident about its ideas does n't work in a cynical way to shrink the electorate			1
it sees in " the next @entity94 " a majority waiting to be made			1
@entity174 has just launched a new nonpartisan campaign to push back against voting restrictions			1
celebrities , musicians and students and many progressives have joined			0
all that 's missing are some @entity9 to argue -- in a visible , unexpected , @entity183 - goes - to - @entity105 way -- that rocking the vote is better than rigging it			2
are there any ? their party needs them , and so does their country .			0

@entity174 recently launched a campaign to push back against voting restrictions
@entity195 : republicans who restrict voting may win now , but party suffers long term
he says a confident party does n't work in a cynical way to shrink the electorate
*liu* : the next @entity94 is waiting to be made , @entity9 should *embrace* all people
