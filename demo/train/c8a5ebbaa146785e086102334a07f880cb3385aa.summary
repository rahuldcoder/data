editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- @entity21 soldiers returning from @entity22 in the early ' 20s and ' 30s came home with arresting tales of voodoo potions , black magic , and living - dead zombies			1
they published their stories in mass - market pulp novels , which in turn inspired horror movies and eventually made their corporeal way to our supermarket aisles during @entity35			1
but back in @entity22 , zombies are real still			1
late last year , just prior to the devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake that ravaged the country , @entity9 producer @entity37 , a camera crew , and i headed to @entity42 in search of the undead , known locally as @entity45			2
in 1937 , @entity21 folklorist and anthropologist @entity48 traveled to @entity22 and encountered the case of @entity51 , a woman who villagers claimed had died in 1907 at the age of 29 but had returned to the living 20 years later			2
@entity48 investigated the rumors and discovered evidence that powerful drugs were used to replicate a death - like state			0
see the rest of @entity61 at @entity9 in 1982 , scientist @entity62 traveled to @entity42 to research the ethnobiological base of the @entity22 zombie , procuring the secret poisons used in the procedure and discovering that the undead are far from a folkloric myth , like vampires or werewolves			1
he concluded that voodoo priests were employing a concoction of tetrodotoxin , a chemical derived from the puffer fish that produces paralysis and can mimic death -- it is 100 times as deadly as cyandide , and something i have a longstanding interest in			0
after zombification , a mind - controlling drug made from a plant called @entity87 was administered to the patient			0
despite unlocking the chemical basis of this phenomenon , however , @entity62 maintained that zombification was not created purely through these poisons , but indeed relied on a tradition of voodoo sorcery hundreds of years old			1
thirty years later , and under the guidance of a massive local man who had survived fourteen bullets to the face , i was off to conduct my own zombie investigation			1
i traveled the countryside , spoke with sorcerers , and collected ( and consumed ) samples of the legendary poison			0
i went heavily armed into places that require you to be heavily armed			0
after months of labor , rigorous chemical analysis of the samples , several incidents that had our entire party mortally afraid , and untold numbers of night visions at the hands of total zombie preoccupation , we 're finally ready to share our findings .			2

stories of zombies in @entity22 have inspired films , shaped concept of the zombie
@entity62 has studied @entity22 zombies , procured poisons said to create them
@entity9 meets @entity62 , travels to @entity22 to conduct its own investigation of phenomenon
