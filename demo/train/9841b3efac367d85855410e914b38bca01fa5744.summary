in @entity81 , sen. @entity80 emerged from a meeting of the @entity83 and appeared pleased with @entity85 's progress			1

the committee chairman rejected the term " stalemate " to describe the effort , which has lasted nearly three months			0
but sen. @entity98 , also a member of the committee , expressed impatience over @entity85 's pace of progress in the northern @entity104 country			1
" i 'm not sure we are acting with decisive abilities that we have to impact the outcome , " the @entity105 from @entity106 said			1
" i felt like , had we moved aggressively , as @entity111 ( @entity110 ) @entity109 ( @entity112 ) and @entity113 ( @entity114 ) suggested in the beginning , maybe the matter would be concluded by now			0
" in @entity120 , @entity117 , outgoing @entity119 defense secretary @entity118 blasted @entity85 as a " two - tiered " alliance poorly equipped to deal with challenges			0
in his farewell speech friday to the @entity124 , he contrasted those members " willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments , and those who enjoy the benefits of @entity85 membership ... but do n't want to share the risks and the costs			2
" gates had harsh words for the conduct of the air campaign against @entity26 's regime			1
he said it had become " painfully clear " that shortcomings could " jeopardize the alliance 's ability to conduct an integrated , effective and sustained air - sea campaign			2
" " while every alliance member voted for the @entity1 mission , less than half have participated at all , and fewer than a third have been willing to participate in the strike mission , " he said			0
@entity118 concluded with a warning about @entity119 willingness to continue bearing a growing part of the @entity85 burden			0
" the blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the @entity156 ... to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be a serious and capable partners in their own defense , " he said			0
@entity85 members must better allocate their resources , follow through on commitments and protect defense budgets from being " further gutted " to avoid " a dismal future , " @entity118 said			0
his warning came on the same day that @entity170 prime minister @entity169 told @entity170 broadcaster @entity171 that @entity170 had offered @entity26 some guarantees , including helping him seek another country of residence , if he were to step down			1
" unfortunately , we still have not received a response from him , " he said			0
on thursday , global powers charting out the course of a @entity1 met in the @entity181			0
@entity119 secretary of state @entity182 and others urged the international community to sustain pressure on the @entity7 regime			0
an opposition spokesman predicted @entity26 would fall within days			1
but friday 's fighting was evidence that , despite 10,439 sorties carried out by @entity85 jets and a fierce opposition revolt , @entity26 was holding strong			1
in a three - page letter purportedly from @entity26 to the @entity156 that was given to @entity2 by the office of house speaker @entity196 , the writer calls for a cease - fire			1
" let 's stop the destruction and begin the negotiations to find a peaceful solution for @entity1 , " it says			2
" i appeal to you , as the great democracy , to assist us to determine our future as a people			1
" the letter calls the @entity85 military effort " inappropriate and illegal interference in what is essentially a @entity7 civil war			1
" " if authentic , this incoherent letter only reinforces that @entity26 must go , " said @entity196 spokesman @entity214			1
" there 's no disagreement about that			2
that 's why so many @entity119 have questions -- which the @entity221 refuses to answer -- about the administration committing @entity119 resources to an operation that does n't make his removal a goal			1
" a senior administration official told @entity2 that the letter " probably " is genuine but added that @entity26 " obviously did n't write it , for it 's not weird enough			1
" the official said it was not clear what the letter meant			2
" it will be hard to take seriously that he wants to talk about transition when he wo n't even take the bare minimum steps of putting a cease - fire into place , " the official said			2
meanwhile , @entity85 officials have said repeatedly that airstrikes are aimed solely at military targets , but a senior @entity85 military official with operational knowledge of the @entity1 mission has told @entity2 that attacking @entity26 was justified under the @entity248 mandate			1
the resolution applies to the @entity7 leader because , as head of the military , he is part of the command - and - control structure and therefore a legitimate target , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity			2
the official was not authorized to talk to the media			0
but the @entity85 official declined to give a direct answer when asked whether @entity26 was being targeted			1
@entity85 spokeswoman @entity261 , however , said the alliance was not specifically targeting @entity26			2
