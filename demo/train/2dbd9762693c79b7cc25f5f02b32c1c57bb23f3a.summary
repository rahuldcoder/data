" there is a concrete possibility that the pope might pardon him ( @entity2 ) , but it is up to him to decide when and how , " @entity49 added			1

he told how he had photocopied many confidential papal papers , saying he did so because he wanted to expose wrongdoing and corruption			2
observers say that despite the trial , questions remain about how @entity2 managed to remove such confidential and potentially damaging documents from @entity10			0
there is also continued speculation over whether someone high up in the @entity20 , perhaps a cardinal , may have helped him , although @entity2 denied having an accomplice			2
some of the private documents contained allegations of financial corruption , claims the @entity51 might have preferred to keep under wraps			0
@entity2 was arrested in may , following a @entity10 investigation into how the pope 's private documents appeared in the best - selling book " @entity159 " ( " his holiness " ) , by @entity45 journalist @entity158			1
