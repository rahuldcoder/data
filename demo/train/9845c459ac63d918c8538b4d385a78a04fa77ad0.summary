@entity0 -- the presidential campaign fundraising numbers being reported paint a picture of what 's to come over the 13 months until the 2012 election : a flood of television ads , cross-country bus tours and a lot of handshakes			1
money drives a campaign , and fundraising is a signal of its strength			1
it also allows campaigns to get ahead in the media wars -- on tv , radio , online , in the mail -- and on - the - ground grassroots outreach			0
president @entity24 's campaign has pledged to raise an eye - popping $ 1 billion for his re-election campaign -- an unheard of figure in @entity30 politics -- @entity24 's campaign raised nearly $ 750 million for the 2008 election			1
to put that into perspective , @entity34 presidential candidate @entity33 raised $ 239 million from donors and received $ 84 million collected from public funds -- something that @entity24 chose not to participate in			1
so why does it cost so much to campaign for election in the @entity30 ? bigger country = bigger money " @entity30 is the largest democracy in the world and that 's going to cost a lot of money to express yourself and get your message out , get the vote out , get people to support you and put in ( campaign ) infrastructure , " said @entity34 strategist @entity44			1
in order for a candidate to reach all 50 states within an election cycle , a trove of money will be needed to cover that much ground			2
and then there 's length of @entity30 campaigns			0
@entity67 , a @entity68 strategist and former staffer on @entity71 's successful 1992 campaign , said the length of the @entity30 election cycle dictates that candidates must pile up funds to survive the long haul			2
" if you 're running for prime minister in @entity79 , you do n't spend a year and a half or two years running for office , " he said			0
" the election is called and the opposition party decides it 's going to mount a campaign and you have a concentrated time to focus on that			2
" ( under @entity79 's parliamentary system , the party with the most votes becomes the ruling party , and that in turn determines who becomes the prime minister )			0
in @entity79 , a law known as the @entity94 regulates campaign spending -- anything from party political broadcasts , advertising , rallies and even " issuing disparaging material relating to another party or its candidates , " according to the government 's website			2
in 2010 , the parties and their candidates were regulated by time frames : the " long campaign " -- from january 1 to april 12 when @entity109 was dissolved â € ” and the " short campaign " from the dissolution of @entity109 through election day			1
according to the website , the long campaign had a limit of 25,000 pounds ( about $ 39,000 ) and 7,150 pounds ( about $ 11,200 ) for the short campaign			1
the ad wars television advertising is by far the most expensive item in a campaign 's budget			1
air time in major markets in key swing states can cost a campaign millions of dollars			2
@entity24 spent much of his money in 2008 advertising in large -- and expensive -- markets in battleground states			1
the eventual @entity34 nominee will have to blanket those markets , too			0
and that 's when big @entity34 donors will come calling , @entity44 said			0
" a lot of wealthy donors are waiting on the sidelines waiting to see who the @entity34 candidate is going to be to get behind , " @entity44 said			0
" once that happens it will be very competitive with president @entity24			1
" @entity44 believes that @entity34 will be successful in attracting younger voters and small donors this time around -- something @entity24 capitalized on in 2008			1
@entity67 said the fear for the @entity24 campaign is that because the economy is weak and republicans are eager , if not desperate , to replace him , he has to cover all his bases			1
he needs the support not only of his liberal base but moderates and independents , too -- and do everything he can to get his message out			0
" part of the problem he has had as president is that despite very effective communication effort as a campaigner , he has n't been effective in communicating his successes while he 's been governing , " he said			2
" and he 's going to have to do that more effectively in the coming months			0
" it 's not just tv ads that deplete a campaign 's bank account -- it 's the entire get - out - the - vote effort			2
" i think elections have become more costly because more money is spent on television advertising , on a national campaign infrastructure ... campaign planes , the buses , the whole movement from city to city , " @entity44 said			1
in countries such as @entity79 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 , for example , candidates can blanket media markets with less money			2
and there are restrictions in some countries on how many ads can air			0
big vs. small @entity24 's campaign was able to raise $ 42.8 million between july and the end of september , an @entity24 campaign aide told @entity1			1
between the campaign and the @entity198 , they raised more than $ 70 million in the third quarter			1
some @entity68 sources had earlier expected the combined total to be $ 55 million			2
read more on @entity24 's fundraising numbers the $ 42 million figure most likely will be close to or exceed the total raised by all of the @entity34 presidential candidates together for this quarter			1
of numbers released by @entity34 campaigns before they have to formally submit their fundraising to the @entity212 , @entity208 gov. @entity207 's campaign said it raised $ 17 million , former @entity215 gov. @entity214 's campaign estimated it raised between $ 11 million and $ 14 million and @entity208 rep. @entity217 's campaign said it raised around $ 8 million			1
other @entity34 campaigns did not release their figures ahead of the deadline			0
in the second quarter -- running between april and june -- @entity24 's campaign was able to raise a record - setting $ 87 million			1
the campaign released a list of more than 270 fundraisers -- so - called " bundlers " -- who helped bring in at least $ 50,000 for the campaign and the joint @entity229 victory fund			1
in addition , 31 people raised more than $ 500,000 including @entity233 producer @entity232 , @entity235 editor @entity234 and former @entity237 gov. and @entity30 sen. @entity238			2
bundlers are an integral part of campaign fundraising efforts , since individual donations are limited			0
while federal election law requires campaigns to disclose the names of donors of more than $ 250 , there is no requirement to reveal the names of bundlers			0
@entity24 was able to rake in a large part of his 2008 campaign funds from a swath of small donors -- most of them young			1
this year he is hoping to get those donors back			0
shortly after he announced his 2012 campaign in early april , his staff reported around 23,000 small donors -- who typically give anywhere from $ 25 to $ 100 -- gave to the campaign			1
" @entity24 was largely successful at getting small donors through the social media phenomenon created around his campaign , " @entity44 said			1
" now the @entity34 are mimicking that			0
so i think they 'll be much more competitive with that			0
" where 's it coming from ? @entity67 and other activists believe that too many politicians are guided by special interest groups and wealthy donors -- not the average @entity30 @entity272			0
" we have a campaign financing system that is a grotesque way out of touch with reality of the @entity30 people , " @entity67 said			0
" you have to be wealthy or in touch with the very wealthy in order to get elected to almost any political office -- not just the presidency			0
because of that , corporations and outside groups tend to have a large influence in our elections			0
and on january 11 , the @entity288 ruled that big business , unions and nonprofits now have more power to spend freely in federal elections			0
a 5 - 4 conservative majority crafted a narrow overhaul of federal campaign spending			0
the justices eased long - standing restrictions on " independent spending " by corporations and unions in political campaigns			0
read more about the case shortly after the ruling , @entity24 blasted the decision saying " the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in @entity0 -- while undermining the influence of average @entity30 who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates			2
" @entity67 added that there seems to be a concerted effort to protect the corporate interests and the moneyed interests " because those are the people who write the rules			0
" the past is the past the @entity212 has a breakdown of presidential campaign receipts ( in millions of dollars ) going back to the 1996 presidential race , that shows how dramatically campaign fundraising and spending has multiplied in a short time : 2004 @entity326 : $ 269.6 @entity327 : $ 234.6 2000 @entity326 : $ 95.5 @entity328 : $ 48.1 1996 @entity71 : $ 42.5 @entity329 : $ 44.9 @entity1 's @entity330 , @entity331 and @entity332 contributed to this report .			1
