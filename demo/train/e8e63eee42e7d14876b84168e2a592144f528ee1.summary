@entity1 law enforcement views the case of three teenage @entity5 girls who wanted to join @entity6 as a good opportunity to study how the militant group recruits young people in the @entity10 , @entity1 law enforcement officials told @entity11			1
investigators have studied @entity13 and other social media activities of the @entity5 girls , particularly the eldest , who was active online discussing her gradual turn to conservative @entity19			2
the case has yielded a trove of evidence that shows how @entity6 is using @entity24 already among its fold to directly communicate with new recruits via social media , the officials said			1
the @entity28 is homing in on specific online recruiters , including some believed to be in @entity30 , and others in @entity32 and @entity33			0
these recruiters help provide how - to guides for @entity24 who are inclined to travel and join the @entity6 fight , the officials said			2
a law enforcement official said the recruiters were giving the teenage girls a road map of how to make it from @entity43 to @entity32			0
why is @entity6 so successful at luring @entity24 ? " it 's alarming that @entity1 youths are being radicalized to such a degree they 're willing to jump into the great unknown , " one official said			2
even after identifying those recruiters , however , the next step remains difficult : trying to find a way to arrest them			0
most are thought to be out of reach of @entity1 law enforcement			0
last month , a girl of @entity57 descent and two girls of @entity60 descent skipped school in the @entity43 area and flew to @entity63 with plans to continue to @entity30 , authorities said			1
the girls , 17 , 15 and 15 , wanted to join @entity6 , the militant @entity67 group , authorities said			1
one of their parents noticed his daughter 's passport missing and contacted authorities , who stopped the three girls in @entity63 and sent them back to the @entity1			2
about 2,000 @entity24 have gone to fight in @entity32 , though not all for @entity6 , a @entity77 source told @entity11 last month			0
@entity6 recruitment efforts have posed a challenge to the @entity28 and other agencies trying to find a way to stop such recruitment			0
unlike past radicalization cases , the @entity28 has n't found a @entity1 recruitment network connecting @entity6 to recruits			2
instead they 're finding , as in the @entity5 case , more diffuse connections			0
was arrested teen on his way to join @entity6 ? @entity1 officials said friends of the @entity5 teens noticed them change from seemingly carefree westernized high - schoolers to devout @entity94 who rejected old friends and the regular cares of girls their age			1
but no one called attention to it until after the girls disappeared and became the subject of news stories			0
officials said that while these teens decided to travel " on their own , " and were not forced into anything , this case reflects the larger phenomenon of @entity1 teens being lured to fight with @entity6 through social media			1
@entity113 spy chief @entity112 has said @entity6 and other extremist groups use such platforms as @entity13 , @entity116 and @entity117 to reach their target audience in a language they understand , their methods include making use of popular hashtags for other stories in the news , such as @entity127 or the @entity128 , to disseminate their message , he said			1
they create slick videos and have learned that showing the full extent of their brutality turns people off , he said , hence their posting of videos of beheadings that stop short of showing the moment of death			0
