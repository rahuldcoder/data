@entity0 -- on @entity3 , @entity2 stood up to the @entity4 that has tormented them for years and said : " no mas ! " they gave the @entity4 , in state after state , a merciless beating and helped re-elect president @entity9			1
they also sparked a family feud within the party -- about where to go from here			2
convinced that @entity14 have a record with @entity2 that is n't much better , and that @entity9 -- because of his immigration enforcement record -- did n't deserve their support any more than @entity19 did , i advised @entity2 to skip the line and vote for every office on the ballot except the one at the top			1
instead , about 11 million @entity2 voted for president			2
according to exit polls , @entity9 got 71 % of the @entity28 vote , compared with just 27 % for @entity19			1
and they delivered three critical battleground states -- @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			2
although both parties need to be taught a lesson , i 'll settle for half a loaf			0
the @entity14 got some votes they did n't deserve , but the @entity4 got exactly what they deserved			1
opinion : @entity4 voter suppression fueled black turnout it 's a punishment that was a long time coming			1
it was in 1994 , after @entity44 voters approved @entity45 , a ballot initiative that sought to deny services to illegal immigrant , that @entity4 learned that they could scare up votes and win elections by tapping into fear over changing demographics and offering shelter to racists and nativists who were anti-latino			1
more recently , it was @entity4 who gave us those do - it - yourself immigration laws in states like @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 that require local police to enforce federal immigration laws and make likely the ethnic profiling of @entity2			1
and , finally , it is @entity4 who , when they 're running for president , compete to see who can be toughest on illegal immigrants			1
@entity2 watch all these dramas play out			0
and they do n't forget			0
and , in more bad news for the @entity4 , this is no small tribe we 're talking about			1
with @entity2 making up 16 % of the @entity78 population and projected to reach 30 % by 2050 , and with @entity2 now representing 10 % of the @entity78 electorate and adding 2 million more voters in every presidential election , @entity4 can either make peace or march toward extinction			1
politics : what the election teaches us about ourselves personally , i hope they choose the former			0
@entity14 have it too easy with @entity2 , and @entity4 have it too hard			1
and , the result is that these voters do n't get good service from either			0
but you ca n't fix something until you know why it 's broken			0
after @entity19 's defeat , radio talk show host @entity99 scoffed at the idea that the only way for the @entity4 to have a shot with @entity28 is to turn itself inside out and embrace a full amnesty for illegal immigrants			1
in fact , @entity99 's fellow radio talker @entity108 and conservative columnist @entity110 both say that they now support that view			0
yet @entity99 is n't sold			0
backtracking on immigration would only backfire on the @entity4 , he argued on his radio show , by leading conservatives to desert the party			1
wrong , wrong , wrong			0
when it comes to @entity2 , @entity99 knows nada			0
worse , he jumped to all the wrong conclusions			0
he insists that the real reason that @entity2 vote for @entity14 is n't because of immigration but because they like government handouts and do n't want to work hard			1
@entity2 do n't want to work hard ? is he kidding ? my take : 7 ways religious diversity played in the election besides , i thought the nativist complaint du jour was that @entity28 immigrants take jobs from @entity78 citizens			1
how do they do that while standing in a welfare line ? here are three things that help explain where @entity4 went wrong with @entity28 voters to begin with			1
and following that , here are three things that they can do right to start making amends and live to fight another day			0
what republicans do wrong : -- they pander to racists and nativists			2
at the very least , they remain silent when extremists in their party go off the rails by comparing illegal immigrants to dogs , insects or pigs			0
all of which has been done by @entity4 elected officials			2
-- they fall into what has been the familiar pattern in this country of portraying immigrants , illegal and legal , as inferior , defective , dishonest or predatory			0
one popular narrative is the one advanced by @entity99 : immigrants as takers			0
-- and they do n't ask for advice or take it when it 's offered			0
@entity4 @entity28 consultants report being turned away by the @entity19 campaign , which either did n't care about getting latino votes or were confident they could do it without any help			1
what republicans could do right : -- they need to learn to talk about immigration as an economic issue and not a cultural one , and channel their anger and frustration over a broken system at the system itself and not at desperate human beings who come here for a better life			1
opinion : both parties must lead on immigration -- they need to support and help advance the careers of the @entity4 's current crop of @entity28 rock stars : @entity31 sen. @entity193 , @entity195 senator - elect @entity194 , @entity32 gov. @entity196 , and @entity198 gov. @entity197			1
-- and they need to turn the tables and put the other party on the defensive on those issues , such as education reform and expanding trade in @entity206 , where @entity4 are more in sync with @entity2 than @entity14 are			2
or they could do nothing			0
they could write off @entity28 votes and declare that things are fine the way they are			2
they could remain rigid in their thinking , and declare that a small tent is roomy enough			0
they do n't have to change			0
they do n't have to seek out @entity2 ; they can just wait for latinos to come to them			0
that seems to have been the @entity4 ' strategy in this election			2
how 'd that work out ? politics : the new @entity78 electorate has arrived the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			2

on *tuesday* , president @entity9 received 71 % of the @entity28 vote , says @entity228
the @entity4 got exactly what they deserved , he says
republicans can either make peace or march toward extinction , he says
@entity4 must learn to talk about immigration as an economic , not a cultural , issue , he says
