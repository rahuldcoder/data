-- the gray wolf population in @entity3 has grown enough to be removed from the endangered species list and will stop receiving federal protection next month , the @entity1 announced friday			1
the decision means that gray wolf has recovered from near extinction throughout the @entity10 , which includes all of @entity11 and @entity12 and parts of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , officials said			1
the wolves in @entity3 wo n't be protected under the @entity19 effective september 30 , when the packs will be managed by the state , federal officials said			0
" the return of the wolf to the @entity10 is a major success story , and reflects the remarkable work of states , tribes , and our many partners to bring this iconic species back from the brink of extinction , " @entity1 director @entity22 said in a statement			1
the @entity10 are home to at least 1,774 adult wolves and more than 109 breeding pairs , and the population has exceeded recovery goals for 10 consecutive years , officials said			0
the vast majority of @entity3 's gray wolves live in the northwest section of the state , where the animals will be managed by state wardens as " trophy game " year - round , federal officials said			2
@entity3 officials will regulate the timing , methods and numbers of gray wolves taken through regulated hunting			2
wolves found to be preying on livestock also may be controlled , federal officials said			0
environmental and wildlife groups took exception to the federal decision , saying the gray wolf has n't fully recovered			1
" today 's decision by the @entity1 allows @entity3 to return to the days of random wolf killing that led to the species ' endangerment in the first place , " said @entity62 , wildlife conservation director at the @entity63			1
the environmental group @entity69 said @entity70 last year gave hunters and trappers in @entity12 and @entity11 the right to kill wolves that had been once protected , nullifying a court victory by the group that would have prevented the hunts			0
" @entity3 's open season on wolves in almost all of the state would allow aerial gunning of wolves and even killing wolf pups in their den , " @entity69 attorney @entity78 said			1
" @entity3 law also allows unrestricted killing of wolves if they are found to be ' harassing ' livestock or domestic animals , even if wolves are intentionally baited into the conflict , " said @entity78			2
" these policies could drive wolves back into local extinction			0
" last december , @entity3 counted 328 wolves , including 48 packs and 27 breeding pairs , the @entity101 said			0
that figure included 224 wolves , 36 packs and 19 breeding pairs outside @entity107 , state officials said			0
in areas of @entity3 where wolves are designated as predatory , " no state license is required to take a wolf , and there are no closed seasons or bag limits , " the state agency said			2
hunters are required to report the kill to game wardens within 10 days and are n't required to present the skull or pelt , though state officials are encouraging them to do so for genetic monitoring			0
@entity3 wildlife chief @entity124 said , " we are taking a conservative approach to wolf hunting seasons during this time of transition from federal to state management			2
we need time to assume the important responsibilities of wolf population monitoring , sport harvest management and meeting @entity3 's commitments to wolf conservation in our state			2
" @entity3 officials must ensure population levels of at least 150 wolves and 15 breeding pairs , and the federal wildlife service will monitor the species in @entity3 , @entity12 and @entity11 for at least five years to ensure the animal 's recovery , officials said			0
the federal agency can put the gray wolf back on the endangered list if necessary , @entity146 officials said			1
" our primary goal , and that of the states , is to ensure that gray wolf populations in the @entity10 remain healthy , giving future generations of @entity146 the chance to hear its howl echo across the area , " @entity22 said			1
" no one , least of all @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity3 , wants to see wolves back on the endangered species list			1
but that 's what will happen if recovery targets are not sustained			0
" the gray wolf grows to 2.5 feet in height and up to 6 feet in length , weighing between 80 and 100 pounds			1
its coat varies from black to white , and the animal is noted for its broad snout , round ears , and long , low howl .			0

environmentalists decry decision as a " return to the days of random wolf killing "
gray wolf makes a comeback in @entity3 and will be taken off endangered list
@entity184 means the animal has recovered throughout the @entity10
americans can now " ' hear its howl echo across the area "
