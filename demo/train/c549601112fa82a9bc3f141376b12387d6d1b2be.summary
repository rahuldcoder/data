@entity0 -- @entity2 gave a full - throated endorsement of @entity5 gubernatorial candidate @entity4 on thursday , delivering a fiery speech that hit @entity4 's @entity8 opponent , pushed the larger @entity10 midterm message and , at times , highlighted herself			1
@entity12 's first public campaign rally was a noticeable departure for someone who , until now , has shied away from appearing on stage with candidates			1
in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , the former first lady has opted to tout candidates in tight races behind closed doors			0
@entity4 , however , is a safer bet for @entity12 , as most polls have the @entity26 up by double digits over @entity8 incumbent @entity28			1
" i am here for one reason , as a proud woman for @entity4 , " @entity12 said , touting the @entity26 's focus on education and women			1
" when you strip it all away , that is what this election is all about , " she later added			0
her speech , though , also sounded strikingly similar to stump speeches @entity12 gives when touting herself			2
the former first lady talked up her @entity5 roots ( her father 's side of the family was from @entity48 ) and noted the importance of turnout by subtly referencing her failed 2008 presidential election			2
" from my perspective , you ca n't count on things turning out the way you wanted , " @entity12 said			0
" you 've got to work for it			0
" and while two large @entity4 for governor signs stood on stage in front of the roughly 900 attendees , the crowd clearly was more excited to see @entity12 , a potential 2016 presidential candidate			1
@entity2 's midterm campaign schedule " listen , i am the one running for governor , " @entity4 said , half joking , when @entity12 peeked her head around the curtain behind the stage and the crowd erupted in applause			1
@entity12 touted @entity4 as a " fresh start , " someone who would fight for @entity5 families and workers and " turn around " the state			1
" i am pleased that you are all here supporting that campaign , " @entity12 told the supportive crowd			2
" because you are convinced , as i am convinced , that @entity4 is the right leader and the right time for @entity5 's hard - working people			1
" before the public endorsement , the former first lady headlined a high - dollar , closed fund - raiser for @entity4			0
campaign aides would not confirm how much money was going to be raised , but in the past @entity12 has raised as much as $ 1 million for candidates			2
@entity12 's event with @entity4 offered a dramatic contrast to the time she spent with @entity20 gov. @entity88 on wednesday in @entity89			1
while @entity12 and @entity4 stood in front of a cacophony of television cameras and cheering supporters , @entity12 and @entity88 spent most of their time together behind closed doors at a private fund - raiser			1
the only time @entity12 and @entity88 did spend in public was when the duo made an unannounced stop at a college @entity100			0
@entity12 shook hands with well wishers and posed for pictures , while @entity88 urged students to vote in november			0
the former secretary of state posed for countless pictures and many students asked her for selfies			0
unlike @entity4 , who is ahead in every poll , @entity88 is an incumbent with an uphill battle to keep his job			0
the trend is more than just @entity88 and @entity4 , too			0
last week in @entity114 , @entity12 appeared behind closed doors with @entity116 despite the fact that the @entity26 's campaign would have loved the image of the @entity18 gubernatorial hopeful standing with the former secretary of state			1
@entity116 's race to unseat @entity8 @entity122 is close in nearly every poll			2
what 's more , @entity12 will appear next week in @entity125 at an event with @entity127 , the @entity10 @entity128 nominee			2
most polls have @entity127 up double digits over @entity8 @entity131			0
that event will be open to the press .			0
