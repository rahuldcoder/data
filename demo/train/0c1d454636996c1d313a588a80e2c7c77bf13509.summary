-- it was one of the most unexpected announcements of the year			0
in april , @entity3 released the news that its lead character , @entity5 , would die in an upcoming issue of " @entity7			1
" the story wo n't affect the overall @entity10 storylines , as " @entity7 " takes place in an alternate timeline			1
still , the visual of @entity10 having been gunned down was quite a shock to fans			1
with the issue , " @entity7 " no. 36 , coming out today , we now know more details about how @entity10 dies ( spoiler alert , of course ! )			1
@entity20 , the first openly gay character in @entity3 history , is a senator in the " @entity7 " universe , and he 's in favor of gun control			1
an attempt is made on @entity20 's life , and @entity10 takes the bullet for his friend			1
" @entity10 died as he lived -- a hero , representing the best in all of us , " @entity3 ceo @entity29 said in a news release			1
@entity29 spoke to @entity0 in april , when the news was broken			0
@entity0 : can you explain the " @entity7 " series for the uninitiated ? @entity29 : " @entity7 " is @entity10 's future			1
it gives readers a look into what his life would be like after high school and college , which has never really been explored			0
most fans are familiar with @entity10 as a high schooler , hanging out at @entity47 's @entity46 with his friends			1
" @entity7 " shows what happens when @entity10 becomes an adult and starts dealing with grown - up issues			1
each issue is normally split into two storylines , one telling a tale of @entity10 married to @entity55 , another with him ending up with @entity57			1
the final issue , however , will show readers @entity10 's final fate in both timelines -- and they 're the same			1
@entity0 : why kill @entity10 ? @entity29 : i think it 's the natural conclusion to the " @entity7 " series			1
@entity10 dies as he lived : heroically			1
he dies saving the life of a friend and does it in his usual selfless way			2
@entity10 has always been a representation of us -- the best of us			1
our strengths and our faults			0
writer @entity76 , with input from myself , has crafted an emotional , impactful and classic story that i know will survive the test of time			0
this is n't a random one - off or " what - if " story that we 're doing as a gag			0
this is the story that we mapped out carefully and with much thought			0
this is the death of @entity10 as we see it , and we 're treating it with that same level of gravitas and import			1
it 's a once - in - a - lifetime event , and we are being very considerate about it			2
@entity0 : what are you hoping to accomplish with this storyline ? @entity29 : first and foremost , like with anything we do at @entity10 , we want to tell a great , memorable story			1
that being said , this story in particular is of the utmost importance to us as a company and as a keeper of the @entity10 brand			2
we want to not only show how @entity10 's life ends but also what he means to the world around him			1
we want to celebrate his life			0
after the events of " @entity7 " no. 36 , fans will leap forward a year to see the aftermath and how his friends have moved on since his surprising death			2
what 's @entity115 doing ? how are @entity57 and @entity55 dealing with the loss ? it 's not about the attention - grab of the death but about telling a great , evocative story that reminds people why this character is important to the fabric of pop culture -- and showing how heroic a normal guy like @entity10 can be and how important it is to realize that			1
this is n't a story we 're going to retcon a few weeks from now			0
this is the conclusion to the " @entity7 " story and timeline , and it will allow us as a company and the world to take a moment to look at @entity10 's life as a whole and recognize him as one of the most important characters , not in just comics but in popular culture			1
we want people to feel the same emotional roller coaster we felt putting this story together -- to feel the range of emotions , from happiness , sadness , anger , joy and pride			0
we want people to react to this in a strong way because @entity10 is so important to them			2
@entity0 : how do you hope fans will react , ultimately ? @entity29 : we expect some level of shock , outrage and surprise , followed by understanding			0
as a company , we are not afraid to take risks			0
we 're not scared to shake things up to draw attention to the great stories we 're building here at @entity10			2
i hope fans will be intrigued by this news , pick up the issues in july and realize they 've been given one of the best comics on the stands			0
they 'll be handed a piece of comic book history , featuring some of the most well - known characters in the world saying goodbye to an icon			0
we want fans to talk about this for years to come			0
we think this story is bigger than anything we 've ever done			0
it 's bold , dramatic and best of all , a fitting end to the life of @entity10			1
@entity0 : what do you think @entity3 has been doing by shaking things up over the recent years ? @entity29 : we 're a sleeping giant			0
years ago , before i stepped in as ceo , @entity10 was seen as a dormant , nostalgia brand stuck in amber			2
we were in suspended animation			0
people thought the stories were still set in the ' 50s ! now , while the characters -- like @entity57 , @entity10 , @entity55 , @entity115 and @entity200 -- are at their core the same , @entity202 has changed			2
it 's caught up with the times			2
the town of @entity202 you read about now is like any other in @entity208			0
it 's diverse , it 's not problem - free , and it represents @entity208 in an honest way			0
@entity10 is about being welcoming , diverse and entertaining			2
we 've managed to strike that balance in our storytelling for the last five years and managed to not only get attention but keep people entertained			0
from the introduction of @entity20 , the first regular gay character in comics , to now , the death of @entity10 , we 've not been afraid to take risks			2
the big thing is , though , our risks pay off because the stories , art and execution are spot - on			0
we back up what we say			0
@entity0 : what will be the long - term impact of this story ? @entity29 : well , this is the end			0
this is how @entity10 dies in the pages of " @entity7			1
" we will not be retconning , reversing or backtracking on this story in terms of " @entity7			2
" the main @entity10 line , however , telling stories of @entity10 in high school , will continue			2
" @entity242 " ( the " @entity10 " zombie series ) will continue , and we will keep on taking risks with different and new interpretations of our characters			1
but as far as we see it , this is how @entity10 dies			1
that 's how we approached this story and how we 're treating it .			0
