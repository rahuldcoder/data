editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity4 contributor on national security issues , served as president @entity7 's chief anti-terrorism and homeland security adviser			1
@entity2 has spent more than two decades in the fields of intelligence and criminal justice and has served during the past three administrations			2
@entity2 is currently a consultant to the @entity14 @entity13 and a member of the @entity16 and the @entity17			1
@entity2 says the priority for the @entity19 must be protecting the @entity14 people			1
@entity21 ( @entity4 ) -- the @entity22 recently reported that gen. @entity23 , president @entity24 's national security adviser , is reviewing plans to reorganize the @entity27 and @entity28 councils			1
some , if not all , of the functions of the @entity31 may be folded into an expanded @entity32			2
there is no more solemn responsibility that the president bears than to protect @entity14 lives			2
during my 4Â½ years at the @entity19 , i came to believe that , for this reason , organization must be dictated by effectiveness			2
how best to maximize effectiveness will inevitably change over time as we as a country continue to weaken @entity44 and other enemies , as the @entity46 gains strength , and as our government better integrates the capabilities that have been built since the tragedy of september 11			0
as the @entity24 administration considers the most effective means of organizing the @entity19 structure , i respectfully submit that any structure should be judged against three fundamental criteria			2
first , there must be a single person both responsible and accountable to the president who monitors threat information and who has the authority to marshal all instruments of national power ( military , intelligence , law enforcement , economic , diplomatic and public diplomacy ) to defeat the threat			0
this individual can not wait until threats arrive on our shores , but must have the responsibility and the means to identify those threats where they originate and to ensure a coordinated response to them			0
the president 's homeland security adviser must not be constrained by geographic boundaries that our enemies do not respect			1
second , the homeland security adviser must have direct and immediate access to the president			1
ultimately , if terrorists successfully strike the @entity14 , it is the president , and not his staff , who will be accountable to the @entity14 people for the failure			1
the homeland security adviser must be able to get to the president quickly without clearance from his or her colleagues on the @entity19 staff			1
unfortunately , there will be times when @entity14 lives are at stake and the president will need to be advised and operational decisions taken and communicated to the relevant cabinet secretary in real time			2
these sorts of crises do not lend themselves to the normal bureaucratic process			0
third , the homeland security issues faced by our government are diverse and many			2
they range from preparedness and response to natural disasters ( ice , flooding , fires and wind ) to pandemic planning and biological and nuclear threats			0
these issues are often distinct from the more traditional foreign policy issues faced by the @entity32 and require experienced staff with significant expertise			0
the staff must understand state and local emergency management policy issues and concerns			0
they must be organized , not simply to facilitate the homeland security policy process , but also to anticipate and respond to state and local political leaders in a time of crisis			1
the homeland security adviser requires adequate staffing to deal with the counterterrorism and homeland security issues			1
we remain a nation at war with a very determined enemy			0
we have troops deployed in @entity139 and @entity140 , but the national security adviser has many important responsibilities in addition to those two theaters			0
for example , he must contend with the @entity147 peace process and counter proliferation around the world , but most especially in @entity150 and @entity151			0
i worry that increasing the span of control of the national security adviser could dilute the homeland security mission and make it just one more item on a list already overburdened			1
that said , i wish to be clear			0
we should judge any reorganization by the substance and criteria that i have suggested above			0
we must be careful not to assume that a merger means the president cares less about homeland security			1
we must resist this easy organizational chart test and look to the substance of how responsibilities are allocated and how we are being protected			0
let me suggest three questions the administration should ask before deciding on a new @entity19 structure : ( 1 ) is there one person responsible and accountable to the president who looks around the world at threats and advises the president ? ( 2 ) does this one person have direct and immediate access to the president ? and ( 3 ) does this person have adequate staff to fulfill his or her responsibilities ? these are the questions that we should be asking and the criteria against which we should judge the effort			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity19 's top goal must be protecting @entity14 people
she says @entity24 's reorganization might expand @entity32
homeland security concerns must not be *downplayed* in the process , she says
@entity2 : homeland adviser needs direct access to the president
