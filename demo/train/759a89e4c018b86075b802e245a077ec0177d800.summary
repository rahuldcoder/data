@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the coming weeks , @entity3 will attempt to forge a health care bill from proposals developed by five @entity7 and @entity8 committees			0
the final bill will likely include a mandate that most @entity11 buy health insurance , subsidies for the purchase of insurance and bans on denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions			1
the bill may also include a " public option , " government insurance that would compete with private insurance			2
the underlying presumption behind this legislation is that government health insurance should be expanded to cover the uninsured			1
government should not subsidize health insurance -- for the uninsured , the poor , the elderly or anyone else -- or regulate health insurance markets			1
subsidizing health insurance means that patients and doctors are insulated from the costs of health care , so they utilize too much -- often in the form of unnecessary tests or medical procedures whose value has n't been proven			1
this excess demand , along with technological progress , means rapidly growing deficits , so governments limit reimbursements to health providers or ration care			0
this kills innovation and creates its own inequities			0
the taxes necessary to fund subsidies are a drag on economic growth			0
the reason the @entity56 administration and congressional democrats are seeking to cover the uninsured is that health insurance is expensive			1
without government support , many people could not afford health insurance			1
the conventional wisdom is that government should therefore subsidize health insurance for those who can not afford it			1
this confuses two issues : whether government should help the poor , and how government should help the poor			2
if society wants everyone to have health insurance , the obvious approach is to give the poor enough money so that individuals can purchase on their own			1
just because people want government to help the poor does n't require it to pay for specific kinds of goods			2
if some people do not purchase insurance and then become ill , they would have to rely on private charity			0
now one possible objection to designing anti-poverty programs in this way -- cash transfers , but no subsidies for health insurance -- is that it would require a lot of cash			1
that is not a convincing objection			0
health insurance is just as expensive if provided as a separate benefit			1
the cash approach makes clear just how much money is involved , but it does not increase the amount			0
the other possible objection to the cash transfer approach holds that , if left unregulated , private health insurers would deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions			0
thus , some people might get no health insurance at all			1
this outcome is unlikely , however , assuming health insurance is unregulated			2
in that case , insurers would set higher premiums for the unhealthy , but they would cover anyone willing to pay a sufficiently high price			0
thus , the question is whether society should compensate those who face higher prices because of their health status ? the answer is no. advocates for such compensation would suggest that it is basic fairness for society to insure people against the bad luck of being born with lousy genes			0
many differences in health status , however , arise from behavior : heart disease from overeating , lung cancer from smoking , and cirrhosis from drinking , to name a few			0
if society compensates everyone for differences in their health status , it is often rewarding unhealthy behavior , perhaps even encouraging it			1
in addition , it is logical for society to treat the differences in financial well - being due to health in the same way it treats differences due to @entity149 , athletic ability , race , country of origin , family background , and so on			0
these and other factors mean that some people , through no fault of their own , face hard financial circumstances , whether because of their ability to earn income or because of the higher prices they face for certain goods , such as health insurance			2
yet if society tried to equalize all differences resulting from , say , @entity149 , it would kill the incentive to work hard and destroy the economy 's productive capacity			0
thus , most people believe society should reduce these differences -- by helping the poor -- but most also recognize that society should not attempt to eliminate all differences			0
this same tradeoff -- between helping the least fortunate and promoting an efficient economy -- applies in the case of health insurance			2
a reasonable balance is for government to provide a social safety net that protects the poor and allows them to purchase some health insurance on their own			1
an alternative is to provide health insurance vouchers , but only to the poorest segment of society			1
guaranteeing health insurance for everyone is too costly , and it means worse health care for everyone			2
that is why @entity196 , and existing subsidies for health insurance , are treatments that are worse than the disease			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			0

@entity202 : government should not subsidize health insurance
public health insurance will increase costs and reduce quality , he says
providing everyone with health insurance rewards unhealthy behavior , @entity202 says
@entity202 : give the poor health insurance vouchers instead of public insurance
