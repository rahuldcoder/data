-- @entity1 and @entity2 have roared back to form ahead of next week 's @entity4 challenges , with the @entity6 giants recording comfortable victories in @entity8 on saturday			1
@entity1 's title defense has been uncharactistically unconvincing so far , with last tuesday 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity11 their second dropped points in four outings			2
but @entity16 's team responded by crushing @entity17 5 - 0 on the day the club confirmed a historic five - year shirt sponsorship with a @entity21 group and also banned smoking at the @entity24 stadium			1
the @entity27 club 's financial problems have led members to accept 171 million euros ( $ 230 million ) from @entity29 , with 697 out of 809 delegates voting to end a longstanding tradition of no commercial shirt endorsements			0
having reported a loss of 9.3 million euros ( $ 12 million ) in 2010 - 11 , the board has projected a 20.1 million euros ( $ 27 million ) profit for this season			0
@entity16 started with key defenders @entity37 and @entity39 on the bench against @entity17 , ahead of wednesday 's @entity4 trip to @entity42 of @entity43			0
the visitors ' five - goal new striker @entity44 was unable to take advantage -- but at the other end @entity49 scoring machine @entity47 took his league tally to eight this season with a superb hat - trick			1
@entity54 crashed an early shot off the @entity1 crossbar , but @entity57 settled home nerves in the ninth minute and it was 2 - 0 six minutes later when @entity59 unluckily ricocheted a blocked shot from @entity47 into his own net			1
with rain pouring down , @entity47 notched his first of the night in typical style as he jinked into the box from the right flank and curled home at the near post in the 26th minute for his 190th goal in 278 games for @entity1			2
@entity17 held out until the final 12 minutes when @entity47 provided two more moments of solo artistry as @entity1 moved up to second in the table -- a point behind @entity75 , who travel to @entity77 on monday			2
the two - time world player of the year matched the efforts of @entity2 rival @entity80 , who also netted a treble in the earlier 6 - 2 thrashing of @entity83			1
@entity2 's title challenge has also faltered , first with a 1 - 0 defeat by @entity86 and then the midweek 0 - 0 draw with @entity88 , and @entity90 's team suffered a horror start at home when @entity93 scored after just 14 seconds			1
@entity80 leveled seven minutes before halftime after being set free on the counterattack by @entity96 , and @entity97 put real ahead in injury - time with a simple finish after @entity99 headed @entity101 's freekick across the goal			0
@entity80 made it 3 - 1 from the penalty spot when @entity96 was fouled five minutes after the break , but @entity2 were then reduced to 10 men when winger @entity107 was sent off after being booked a second time for handball			2
@entity93 capitalized in the 54th minute with his second from a corner , stabbing a shot across the line despite keeper @entity115 ' best efforts to drag it back out			0
teenage defender @entity117 made it 4 - 2 in the 67th minute , with the 18 - year - old @entity119 somehow volleying in a corner with the back of his foot			0
@entity123 drove in @entity2 's fifth on 73 after a square pass from fellow substitute @entity126 , whose first - half introduction in place of @entity129 swung the match in @entity2 's favor			0
@entity80 completed his second hat - trick this season with six minutes to play , chipping in a penalty after being fouled			1
@entity2 's third win in five outings lifted @entity90 's men into fourth place ahead of tuesday 's @entity4 visit by @entity141 side @entity140			0
in saturday 's other games , third - placed @entity142 joined @entity1 on 11 points with a 1 - 0 win at home to @entity11 as striker @entity147 scored the only goal in the 18th minute			1
@entity11 dropped to fifth behind @entity2 on goal difference			0
@entity150 moved out of the bottom three with a 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity153 , with @entity155 striker @entity154 netting a second - half equalizer for the visitors .			2
