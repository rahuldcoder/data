-- while i was working in @entity3 many years ago , a young boy said to me : " the day we take peace as seriously as a football match , we will achieve it			1
" his words were simple , yet they carried profound implications : football can inspire the passion needed to change the world			1
this encounter also taught me another important lesson : the best ideas come from listening to people and communities			2
why football should be used to change lives today , these two ideas form the basis of streetfootballworld 's work across all five continents			2
we believe in the power of football to change lives -- and we believe that the power to change communities lies in the communities themselves			1
the capacity for social change that lies within the streetfootballworld network is immense -- but how can it be maximized ? read more : building on the @entity36 @entity37 is one country which has huge potential to action change leading up to the 2018 @entity40 , which it will host			1
it must prepare a strategy which delivers a lasting social legacy for its people			0
in the 2018 local @entity48 's recent annual report , ceo @entity46 emphasized the importance of creating a sustainable long term legacy			0
while we fully support this sentiment , our experience shows that it requires careful preparation and involvement across all stakeholders			1
@entity37 football has made headlines with some spectacular investments -- both domestically and on the international stage			1
if this level of commitment can be transferred to the social sphere , @entity37 has the potential to lead the way to a pioneering sporting legacy			2
in this sense , 2018 is a unique opportunity -- and one which it would be a shame to waste			2
so how can it be done ? it has become fashionable to talk about the legacy of large sporting events such as @entity74 and @entity75			0
such events carry with them an enormous potential to create real , lasting social change			0
but this only works if local needs are at the center of any approach			0
@entity83 bridges the gap between host communities and organizing committees to ensure this is the case			1
watch more : could the @entity36 get a bank ? in 2010 , streetfootballworld teamed up with @entity40 to make social change an integral part of the @entity40			1
with the construction of 20 community health , education and sport centers as part of the " 20 centres for 2010 " campaign , the @entity40 environment was able to be used to help assist communities across the @entity102 continent			1
these @entity103 are hosted by community - based organizations , thus impacting target groups , building upon effective programs and responding to local needs			0
the 2010 initiatives were successful due to a combination of local expertise and global commitment			0
we showed how an entire continent could be reached			0
in 2012 , streetfootballworld implemented respect your health , the official community health programme for @entity118 in @entity119 and @entity120			0
working together with local sports institutions , schools and volunteers , we used the passion for the game to spread important messages about healthy lifestyles via a train - the - trainers approach -- thus multiplying the effect and reaching more young people			0

@entity37 must focus on its five year countdown similar approaches will be needed if the 2018 @entity40 is to make an impact on the vast expanse of @entity37			1
ahead of the 2014 @entity40 in @entity147 , we 're campaigning to give as many people as possible a voice to express what a positive legacy means to them			2
we are using the momentum of the @entity40 to support innovative ideas for change on a local level			1
a true social legacy is dependent on local ownership and active participation			0
like in @entity147 , the passion for football is huge in @entity37 -- and over the next five years , @entity37 has the chance to show that football can be more than just a game			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166			2
