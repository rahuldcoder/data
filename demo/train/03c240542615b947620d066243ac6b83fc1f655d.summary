-- @entity2 's @entity1 has approved a bill allowing same - sex couples to marry , but critics and supporters of the legislation say their work is n't over			1
@entity2 could become the fifth state to allow same - sex marriage if a bill becomes law			1
" we were obviously disappointed , " @entity13 , executive director of the conservative @entity14 , said thursday			0
" we do n't think the voters are going to forget about it			2
" on the other side , members of the @entity2 @entity18 , a group that has worked since 2001 for same - sex marriage , were " absolutely thrilled , " said @entity22 , its executive director			1
but noting that the bill is returning to the @entity24 for consideration of changes made by the @entity1 , @entity22 added , " i think the work continues			2
" her organization will encourage supporters to contact their representatives ahead of the @entity24 vote , she said			2
on wednesday , the @entity1 voted 13 - 11 in favor of the bill , which differs from the @entity24 - approved version in that it distinguishes between civil and religious marriage			1
it allows each religion to decide whether to acknowledge same - sex marriage but extends the option of civil marriage to any two individuals , said @entity1 spokeswoman @entity43			1
the @entity24 , which passed the earlier version last month by a margin of seven votes , 186 - 179 , must approve the changed version before it can be sent to gov. @entity48 , a @entity49 who has questioned the need for the bill			1
after the @entity1 vote , @entity48 released a statement saying he believes that " the fundamental issue is about providing the same rights and protections to same - sex couples as are available to heterosexual couples			1
this was accomplished through the passage of the civil unions law two years ago			0
" @entity48 signed the state 's civil unions law in may 2007			0
" to achieve further real progress , " he added , " the federal government would need to take action to recognize @entity2 civil unions			0
" earlier this month , the governor said he believes the word " marriage " should be used only to describe a marriage between a man and a woman , the @entity68 in @entity69 reported			0
" i think the word ' marriage ' is reserved for a marriage between a man and a woman , and i think the real issues really are rights and protections for gay and lesbian couples , " he told reporters on april 15 , according to the newspaper			0
@entity13 said his organization , which was established in 2000 , would " lobby hard " to get the governor to veto the bill			2
he said he expected it to pass the @entity24			0
" look , this is a matter of holding the governor accountable , " he said			0
" he 's been very public with his views on same - sex marriage in the state			1
... we 'll see if he was misleading the voters of @entity2 or if he 'll stand by his word and actually veto it			2
" were the bill to become law , @entity2 would become the fifth state allowing same - sex marriage , joining @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			1
only @entity105 has established the practice legislatively			0
@entity0 's @entity109 contributed to this report .			0
