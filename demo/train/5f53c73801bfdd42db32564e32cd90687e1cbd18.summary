-- if not for the hue of their skin or their ethnicity , 24 soldiers who faced death in service to their nation would have received the most prestigious medals for their valor long ago			2
but they were born and fought in a time when such deeds were not always fairly acknowledged			0
on tuesday , the @entity16 government corrected the oversight			0
president @entity18 honored 24 @entity20 veterans with the @entity21 -- the country 's highest military award , given to @entity16 soldiers who display " gallantry above and beyond the call of duty " -- for their combat actions in @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 " no nation is perfect , but here ... we confront our imperfections and face a sometimes painful past , including the truth that some of these soldiers fought and died for a country that did not always see them as equal , " @entity18 said			1
only three of the soldiers are alive to receive the recognition			2
the rest -- soldiers with last names including @entity46 and @entity47 and @entity48 -- are dead			0
of the 24 honored , 10 never came home			2
the body of one -- cpl. @entity52 -- has never been recovered , @entity18 said			1
for the few who survive , such as @entity54 , this day has been more than 40 years in the making			1
he was fresh - faced and 19 when he volunteered to go to @entity26			1
in 1969 , the @entity20 @entity62 " charged into a hail of fire " to save his injured comrades and retrieve the bodies of the fallen , even though he was shot several times and bleeding			0
the @entity20 would later say his actions on the battlefield that day showed " determination possessed by few men			0
" " the staff sergeant recovered a fallen comrade ... and took out several bunkers even after he was shot several times , " @entity18 said			1
he was honored in 1970 with the @entity20 's @entity74 award			0
today , at age 72 , @entity54 -- who is african - american -- received his nation 's most esteemed military honor			1
" it makes me very proud that they are going back and looking at records , " @entity54 told @entity0			1
but it was never about a medal for @entity54 , who joined the @entity20 in 1959			1
on september 17 , 1969 , he was on a search - and - destroy mission with his company when he learned the commander of another company nearby had been killed			0
" immediately it came to me that i had to recover his body , " @entity54 said			1
" ... leave no man behind under any circumstance			0
" @entity54 was shot three times -- in the chest , arm and left ring finger -- as he carried the casualties out of the line of fire			1
he was then trapped in the firefight			0
" the only thing i could do is fight , to hope i could get out , " he said			1
he was later evacuated from the battlefield			0
less than a year later , he returned to duty in @entity26 where he would be decorated again for his actions in combat			1
there are others , too			0
men like @entity107 , a radiotelephone operator from @entity109 who in 1969 tended injured comrades in @entity26 's @entity112 when his position came under attack			1
according to the citation , @entity107 took out three machine gun bunkers with grenades and gunfire			0
he then returned to care for his wounded comrades , crawling from one wounded man to another to administer aid			0
and there were men like @entity124 , who , while commanding a mobile strike force in @entity26 's @entity130 , " was wounded in the back and head by rocket shrapnel while recovering a wounded comrade , " according to a military commendation			2
still he single - handedly assaulted and knocked out a mortar position before returning to lead his men			0
@entity54 , @entity124 and @entity107 wore @entity20 uniforms as they accepted the medal , which was placed around their neck by @entity18			1
" in the thick of the fight all those years ago , for your comrades and your country , you refused to yield , " the president said			2
in 2002 @entity143 -- as part of the @entity145 -- set up a review of @entity148 and @entity149 veterans who had served in combat since the middle of the century " to ensure those deserving the @entity21 were not denied because of prejudice , " explained the @entity154			1
the congressional action was later amended to open the door for any serviceman or woman denied the award due to discrimination			2
one of those who posthumously received the award is @entity162 , an assistant machine gunner in the @entity163			0
he is the uncle and namesake of actor and rock musician @entity162			0
