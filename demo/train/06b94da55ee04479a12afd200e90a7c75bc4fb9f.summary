the hiv / aids epidemic might not make as many headlines as it used to , but it continues to infect tens of thousands in our country each year			1
and , unfortunately , some groups in the @entity6 are being affected at the kinds of rates you would expect to see in hard - hit developing countries			2
@entity11 , being marked saturday , is a good moment to reignite the conversation over a crisis that should have ended years ago			1
despite representing only 13 % of the @entity6 population , @entity15 - @entity14 account for nearly half of all new hiv infections each year			1
true , the impact of @entity11 varies across the black community -- hiv infection rates have declined among injection drug users , black women , and black infants born to seropositive mothers			2
and new hiv infections among black heterosexual men are stable			1
but the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) has recorded a troubling spike in new hiv infections among black gay and bisexual men			1
black gay men have been the only black population in which new @entity11 cases have been growing since 2001			2
indeed , the @entity28 estimates that one in three black gay men in major @entity6 cities is @entity11 positive			1
@entity11 deaths among african - americans drop 18 % , @entity28 says meanwhile , although hiv rates have declined among black women and black injection drug users , there are regions of the country where mortality among @entity11 - positive black women exceed other populations , while viral suppression , a goal of @entity11 medication that limits transmissibility to others and often ensures a long and healthy life , continues to remain elusive for many injection drug users			2
a common misconception about the higher prevalence of @entity11 among black people is that it is caused by engaging in more risk - associated behaviors			2
several studies demonstrate that black @entity14 do not necessarily engage in more high - risk behaviors than others			2
so why are black communities typically disproportionately affected ? a new report released by the @entity67 tries to shed some light on this issue , and why the disparities have deepened over time			0
a close examination of the epidemic within the black population is important because it will mean that we are better equipped to fight @entity75 through better understanding how racial discrimination , poverty , lack of access to health care and other socioeconomic factors contribute to the disproportionate burden of @entity11 among @entity14			1
given the fact that a substantial number of black @entity14 are uninsured or underinsured , the @entity84 has been a crucial policy development for black @entity14 living with or at risk for @entity11			1
historically , many people with @entity11 were barred from accessing health care services			2
now , health insurance programs expanded under the @entity84 are prohibited from denying coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions			0
further , certain preventive services , such as routine @entity11 screening , must be provided at no cost to the beneficiary			0
and all plans must provide treatment			0
this is especially beneficial is tackling the problem as early @entity11 treatment has been found to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to other partners by 96 percent			0
but obstacles remain in delivering health care to black @entity14 with @entity11			1
for example , an essential tool to fight @entity11 and racial health disparities is @entity111 , the single largest source of coverage for people with @entity11 in the @entity6			1
however , a @entity116 decision ruled that @entity111 expansion under the @entity84 can only be available to uninsured people living in states that choose to implement it			0
unfortunately , about 20 states have opted out			0
in these states , an estimated 8.5 million uninsured @entity14 who would have qualified for full @entity111 coverage will most likely remain uninsured			0
@entity14 living in those states are twice as likely to be uninsured and more than six times as likely to have @entity11			1
this is most notably the case in the @entity127 , where nine states with high rates of hiv / aids diagnoses have opted not to expand @entity111			0
focusing on populations at highest risk for @entity11 -- especially black gay men -- must also be a priority			0
" when new infections among young black gay men increase by nearly 50 percent in three years , we need to show more that their lives matter , " said president @entity135 during a @entity137 address in 2011			0
this mandate was heard , and notable efforts are now underway across various federal agencies to better address @entity11 among black gay men			0
one encouraging sign has been the way the private sector has responded			0
for example , a multi-million dollar initiative was just announced by @entity152 to address the @entity11 epidemic among black gay and other men who have sex with men in @entity158 , @entity159 , and @entity160 , @entity161 , two @entity6 cities hit hard by @entity75			1
but more must be done			0
one thing that should be the focus of policymakers is ensuring that we prioritize and dedicate resources to boost treatment and prevention programs targeting black gay men , and improve care for @entity11 - positive black women and injection drug users we should also expand our education and awareness initiatives to diminish the stigma and discrimination that prevent too many people from seeking @entity11 testing , prevention and treatment services			0
and finally , we can do more to ensure proper access to health care for millions of @entity14 living in poverty and deliver essential care to people with @entity11 , and help prevent its spread			1
closing the gap on racial disparities in the @entity188 in the @entity6 will require that we confront the underlying factors that fuel the epidemic among black @entity14 and tackle them head - on , with the urgency they deserve .			1
