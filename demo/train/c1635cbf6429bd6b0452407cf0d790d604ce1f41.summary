@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was three months pregnant when she heard neighbors in her corner of @entity0 screaming : " the sea is rising ! the sea is rising ! " a wall of water twice as high as a house engulfed communities like @entity3 's around the @entity13 , from @entity1 to @entity14 , the day after christmas 2004 , leaving some 200,000 people dead or missing in 12 countries in a tsunami that the @entity18 says caused more casualties than any other in recorded history			1
i first met @entity3 in the chaotic aftermath in @entity0 and watched as she returned to the ruins of her home for the first time since the catastrophe			1
it was a pitiful scene			2
her home , and every building around it , had been ravaged down to their foundations by the roaring waves			0
@entity3 sifted through the rubble , lifting a torn garment that belonged to her grandmother			1
the dress had been snagged on a piece of masonry , but the elderly lady it belonged to was n't able to hold on			0
@entity3 's grandmother , husband and eight other relatives were sucked out to sea			1
none of their bodies were ever identified			0
@entity3 was also unable to fight the swirling vortex of water			1
she was carried on the currents far out to sea , where she drifted semi-conscious for more than ten hours			0
did you survive the tsunami ? did you lose a loved one ? share your thoughts on the 5th anniversary on @entity57 fishermen in a passing boat saved her life when they plucked her out of water filled with debris			1
five years on , her neighborhood has been rebuilt , with homes made of wood and concrete , but little inside			1
the roads , bridges and mosques are better than you would find in an average @entity1 town			1
the baby she was carrying in her womb the last time we met is now a healthy four - and - a - half - year - old boy named @entity78			0
he is a child of the tsunami -- carried on the killer waves that spared him and his mother but took so many others			2
" people were surprised seeing me pregnant without any wound , " said @entity3 , who was convinced her baby would be affected			1
" i swallowed a lot of that black , warm and stinky seawater			0
i thought the baby might get hurt from the water			0
when i checked , the baby was fine			0
i do n't know how ; it 's @entity91			2
" she said after his birth , others asked her : " how come this tsunami baby is perfectly fine ? " @entity3 's new house is not perfect : it is little more than a wooden shack built with aid money			1
she has remarried and has another boy with her second husband , who is a soldier			2
like thousands of people here and others in countries where the tsunami struck , they have tried to rebuild their shattered lives as best they can			2
" i feel sad when i remember what happened to me , it 's painful , " she said			2
" my kid was born without a father , other kids have both their parents			0
i did n't have a house , i went back to the refugee camp instead			0
i did n't get any help , no milk , no diaper			0
" but @entity3 said she also felt blessed			1
" i was lucky to survive , people said that this baby had brought me luck			0
