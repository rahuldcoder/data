-- this is a game with intriguing story lines : @entity3 against @entity4			1
this is a game the @entity10 ca n't afford to lose			1
this is a game that will be " massive			2
" " there 's no other word to say ( it ) , " said @entity10 coach @entity13			1
at noon et thursday , the @entity10 soccer team takes on the soccer behemoth @entity18 in the globe 's biggest sporting spectacle , the @entity21			1
chances are , that for those 90 - some minutes , your office will get little work done			0
your co-workers will huddle by the tvs in the break room			0
your bosses will likely be away at long " lunches			0
" and you , who was perfectly content going through life blissfully unconcerned about soccer , will feel a little left out			0
here 's a cheat sheet to make you an insta - pundit on this crucial showdown			2
follow the live blog why you should care the eyes of the world are on the @entity10 @entity10 ca n't very well be the world 's super power and be mediocre at soccer			1
this is its chance to go toe - to - toe with the second - best team in the business : the ruthlessly efficient @entity18			1
when the tournament began , the luck of the draw placed the @entity10 team in the so - called " @entity52			1
" the boys , led by @entity55 aka " @entity54 , " survived @entity56 , beating them 2 - 1			0
then , they almost slayed powerhouse @entity57			0
almost -- but for a last - minute header that torpedoed their lead			0
that game ended in a 2 - 2 draw			1
now , the only thing standing between this group stage and a sweet spot in the next round is @entity18 , @entity67 for " @entity68			1
" '' the @entity10 is known to give everything they have in every single game , " @entity13 said			1
" we have that fighting spirit			0
" why you should worry here 's one reason : the two teams have met nine times ; @entity18 's come out on top six of those times			1
here 's another : in the last seven @entity81 , @entity18 has always won its its third game			1
gulp ! here 's a third : @entity87 's last game was in @entity88 , a notoriously hot and muggy field in the @entity91 jungle			1
every other team that played in that giant sauna lost their next matches			2
why you should n't worry because the same man who was responsible for transforming @entity18 into a lean , mean fighting machine is now the @entity10 coach			1
@entity13 took the @entity67 national team all the way to the @entity21 semifinals in 2006			2
more importantly , he changed the way the @entity67 played			2
he turned a defense - minded squad into hungry goal - seekers			0
he 's instilled those same traits on the @entity10 team			1
" we know how dangerous @entity87 can be if we only play at 90 % and not take them seriously , " said @entity67 player @entity106			0
need more ? @entity18 may have peaked			1
the team decimated @entity57 in its first game , but looked sluggish against @entity56			2
the @entity10 was potent in its first match ; even better in its second			1
need a third ? the last time the teams met -- in a " friendly " in june of last year -- @entity10 beat @entity18 4 - 3			1
a " friendly " match is a game arranged between teams outside tournament competition			2
who you should watch @entity18 's @entity120			1
he is one of only two players who 've scored a hat trick in this tournament -- that 's 3 goals in one game			1
( the other is @entity129 's @entity128			2
) hat tricks are rare -- and a true measure of a striker 's prowess			2
on the @entity10 side , @entity55 wo n't disappoint			1
he scored the sixth - fastest goal in @entity21 history when he plowed one in 29 seconds into @entity87 's opener with @entity56			2
he took a foot to the face , broke his nose -- and returned in the game against @entity57 to score again			2
expect a comeback from @entity144			0
he 's been a disappointment so far			2
he kept losing the ball during the @entity56 match			0
and even though he was much , much better in the second @entity10 outing , it was he who lost the ball that led @entity57 to tie the game			1
he 'll be looking to redeem his reputation as " @entity144 " ( the general ) , a nickname @entity156 fans bestowed on him when he played for the club , @entity157 , for his ability to take charge and score goals			2
who wo n't be there reliable goal scorer @entity163 , who strained his hamstring in the opener			0
he sat out the @entity57 game and has to sit out this one too			0
what should you ignore any talk of the two teams conspiring to settle for a tie			0
if the @entity10 and @entity18 play to a draw , both advance to the second round			1
this has led some soccer fans to grouse that given @entity13 's close relationship with the @entity67 coach , the two may strike some sort of backroom deal			1
@entity182 was @entity13 's assistant when he coached the @entity67 national team			1
the two are now close friends			0
also , @entity87 's roster is stacked with five @entity186 who will now go head - to - head with the same players they grew up with			0
but both coaches have rejected any talk of colluding			0
" ' i do n't think that we are made for draws , " @entity13 said after the @entity57 encounter			0
" ' i think both teams go into this game and they want to win the group			1
'' @entity182 is equally dismissive			0
" when you want to draw , it never works			0
it 's impossible , " he said			0
" always , the aim is to win the match			0
" what should the @entity10 do in @entity206 , the @entity10 has one of the best goal keepers in the world			1
but he will be tested big time by a relentless @entity67 attack			0
so , the @entity10 has to try and go for an early goal , like it did with @entity56			1
aside from an incredible morale boost , it 's better than trying to keep @entity18 at bay for 90 minutes			1
how can the @entity10 advance there are several scenarios			1
the obvious is to beat @entity18 outright			1
@entity87 would get three points for the victory , giving it seven			0
no other team in the group can match that , so the @entity10 go through to the next stage			2
it goes through even with a tie			0
that gives both five points			0
but if the @entity10 loses , things get complicated			2
it 'll then depend on the outcome of the other @entity56 - @entity57 game , which will be going on at the same time			0
@entity57 wins by a narrow margin , @entity87 still comes second in the group and goes through			0
that 's because @entity57 is way down in the point count			0
but if @entity56 wins by two or more , it 'll be the @entity236 and not the @entity10 who advance -- making this the third @entity21 in a row where @entity56 eliminates @entity87			2
who will win expect a desperate scramble to score a first goal			0
whoever scores first gets the edge			0
however , if the game is still scoreless , say , in the 60th minute , expect both @entity18 and the @entity10 to pull back and settle for a draw			1
5 things : what to watch for today @entity248 goes on despite weather @entity0 's @entity250 and @entity251 contributed to this report .			0

a win or a draw sends @entity10 to the next round
@entity18 has won 6 of the 9 times it played @entity10
the @entity10 coach was once @entity18 's national coach
