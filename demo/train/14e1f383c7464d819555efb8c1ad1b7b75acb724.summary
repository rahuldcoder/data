@entity0 told her father she was going to a wedding			2
instead , the 15 - year - old @entity5 girl hopped on a plane with two friends to @entity8 -- and police fear they are headed to @entity10 to join @entity11			1
" what she 's doing is completely nonsense , " said @entity0 's father , @entity12			2
he implored @entity0 to come home			2
" remember how we love you			2
your sister , brother , they can not stop crying			1
" six days ago , the trio of @entity5 girls ran away from home and flew from @entity23 to @entity24			1
it 's unclear where @entity0 , 15 - year - old @entity26 and 16 - year - old @entity27 are			0
but authorities worry their next stop will be @entity10			1
@entity31 , a representative for @entity8 president @entity32 , said at a news conference that @entity8 is helping search for the girls			1
" about these three @entity5 citizens : @entity5 authorities and @entity8 authorities , our security forces and our intelligence service are working together diligently to find them , to stop them or to figure out what is motivating them if they came here , " he said			1
@entity5 authorities hope the trio will reach out to them			1
" this is an ongoing , live counterterrorism operation , and we 're concerned about these three girls , " @entity51			1
" there 's a good possibility , a strong possibility , that we can stop them going into @entity10			1
and our main objective here is to make contact with these three young girls , for them to make contact with us , preferably			1
" but so far , silence			0
the notion that three girls from @entity23 could succumb to the lure of @entity11 highlights the terror group 's aptitude for recruiting young foreigners			2
why is @entity11 so good at attracting @entity69 ? @entity5 prime minister @entity70 said the case illustrates the need to fight @entity11 on multiple levels			1
" it does make a broader point which is the fight against @entity77 terror is not just one that we can wage by the police and border control , " @entity70 said saturday			1
" it needs every school , every university , every college , every community to recognize they have a role to play , we all have a role to play in stopping people from having their minds poisoned by this appalling death cult			1
" @entity26 's family has also made a public plea in hopes the girls will return			2
" @entity10 is a dangerous place and we do n't want you to go there			1
get in touch with the police and they will help to bring you home , " the girl 's family said in a statement released by police			0
" you are not in any trouble			0
" the family said @entity26 has strong desires to help those she believes are suffering in @entity10			1
" you can help from home			0
you do n't have to put yourself in danger , " her family said			0
" please do n't cross the border			0
please come home to us			0
our @entity116 needs you home and is really worried			0
we are not mad at you , we love you			0
" @entity5 police say they are concerned about the number of young women and girls who are either hoping to or who already have joined @entity11			1
while they would n't divulge numbers , they say it 's a growing trend			0
@entity26 's sister , @entity126 , described the 15 - year - old as an " a-star student			0
" but even bright , promising children can fall prey			0
" to convince such young girls at that age that are so vulnerable ... it 's just wrong , " @entity26 said			2
" it 's a really evil thing to do			0
you 're breaking up entire families			0
" @entity54 said there are ways of helping detect whether teens may be drawn to a terror group			0
" if young people are showing interest in passports , trying to get hold of lots of money , there are signs			2
anything breaking the normal routine , any evidence ... of children lying about where they may be , " he said			0
@entity5 police say once they 're in @entity10 with @entity11 , it 's unlikely they will ever be allowed to leave			1
@entity1 's @entity158 contributed to this report , as did @entity160 in @entity161 , @entity162 .			0

3 teen @entity5 girls *missing* for 6 days might be en route to @entity10
@entity70 : schools can help stop people from being " poisoned by this appalling death cult "
