editor 's note : @entity4 contributor @entity2 is a best - selling author whose new book is " @entity6 : a @entity7			1
" @entity2 says discussion of ballplayer @entity10 ' corpse is a shameful way to remember the superstar			1
( @entity4 ) -- " i was scared , " @entity10 said			1
he was talking about his lifelong fear of not being good enough -- of coming up short			1
" i was always afraid i might fail , " he said			1
" i was pictured as being so cocky -- i might have been cocky to some people , but not in my heart			2
all the time , i was just hoping to make whatever league i was in			2
" i am thinking about a long conversation i had with @entity10 toward the end of his life			1
i 'm thinking about it because of the unconscionable thing that is being done to him now that he is gone , now that he is without any defenses			2
you may have heard about a new book that makes some cruel and repugnant allegations about the mistreatment of his remains			1
what has been done to @entity10 ' good name since his death at age 83 in 2002 is heartbreaking			1
first there was the very public battle within his family about what to do with his body ; when it was entrusted to a facility that specializes in cryonics -- freezing -- there were tasteless gags all over television			2
now there is the nauseating voyeurism surrounding these new allegations			2
they are unspeakable , and i will not repeat them here			2
he has been made a joke			2
it is as if there has been a conscious effort to rob him of his humanity			2
as if he is a punch line , as if he was never a person with thoughts and feelings			2
no one deserves this , and certainly not @entity10			1
a magnificent 19 - year career with the @entity64 ; twice the winner of baseball 's triple crown ; the last ballplayer to hit .400 in a season ; two tours of duty in the military in @entity73 and the @entity74 ... this is the man whose right to rest in respectful peace is being stripped from him			1
and because he can no longer speak for himself , i will share with you his voice from a time when he could			2
" i ca n't believe how well people have treated me , how nicely , " he told me			2
he had suffered a series of strokes ; he knew there was n't much time left			0
i was writing a monthly column for @entity90 , and he had agreed to talk with me			0
i told him that there was something striking about his voice : he sounded just like @entity93			0
" @entity93 sounded like me , " he said , not kidding			0
when he told me about his fear of failure , it was in the context of always being fixated on his own shortcomings			0
" the only time i could savor an evening is if i had done something well , " he said			0
" my most disappointing things all my life were always related to baseball			1
i did n't feel good because i did something successfully ; i felt bad if i failed to do something that i was expected to do			0
" as a young ballplayer , he supposedly said , " all i want out of life is that when i walk down the street , people will say , ' there goes the greatest hitter who ever lived			1
that was what people said about him			0
did it satisfy him ? " i would slide down in my seat a little bit when i heard someone say that , " he told me			0
" because i wanted people to believe it , but i did n't believe it myself			0
i did n't believe it then , and i do n't believe it now			0
@entity130 , @entity131 -- they were so good			0
when i would be at a dinner and someone would say i was the best , i would want to hide out of sight and sink into the floor			0
" at the height of his talent , he stepped away from baseball to fly @entity142 fighter jets in @entity143			1
he was a @entity144 pilot ; often he would go out on two - plane missions flying side - by - side with a young @entity144 hotshot by the name of @entity149			0
talk about two @entity150 you can count on in a pinch ...			0
i asked @entity149 about @entity10 once			1
" he was just great , " @entity149 said			0
" the same skills that made him the best baseball hitter ever -- the eye , the coordination , the discipline -- are what he used to make himself an excellent combat pilot			1
" this is the man who is being degraded today			1
this is the man who is being treated , in death , as if he is in a carnival sideshow			1
as i spoke with @entity10 , with his eyesight failing and his body inexorably shutting down , i asked him : if he could change one thing in his life , what would it be ? he said that this , more than anything else , is what he wished for : the ability to " run like a deer			1
" i thought he was talking about wishing he could have his youth back -- wishing , in his old age , that he could stand up and run again			0
but that was n't it			0
he said he wished that , back when he was a player , he was just a little faster			1
" i would run to first , " he recalled of his years with the @entity64 , " and there would be that boom - boom			0
" the sound of being called out at first base , the ball hitting the fielder 's glove just before @entity10 's foot hit the bag			1
" if i could have run a little faster ... how many at - bats did i have ? " he asked me			0
" seven thousand ? " i told him it was 7,706			0
" if i could have run just a little faster , i bet you i could have had 50 more hits , " he said			0
there was wistfulness in his voice			0
" maybe a hundred , " he said			0
a man seeing death just up the road , still dreaming of excellence			1
that is the man whose dignity we have treated with such awful indifference			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : discussion about @entity10 ' remains is *distasteful*
he recalls superstar player as a man who always strove to do his best
@entity10 was baseball 's last .400 hitter and a *veteran* of two wars
