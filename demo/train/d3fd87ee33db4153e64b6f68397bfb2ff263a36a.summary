editor 's note : @entity2 is an assistant professor of sociology at @entity4 and an @entity5 at the @entity6			2
he is also author of the forthcoming book , " @entity7 : @entity9 " ( @entity10 )			0
@entity11 says many @entity13 - @entity12 are the children of @entity12 - born parents			1
( @entity15 ) -- just about any celebration of @entity17 ( september 15 - october 15 ) will highlight the diversity among @entity19			0
they come from different parts of the @entity23 - speaking world , have settled in various areas of the @entity12 , have distinctive customs and come in all shapes and colors			2
but an often overlooked difference among @entity19 relates to how many generations back they trace their roots in @entity12 history			0
@entity19 are not just immigrants or the @entity12 - born children of immigrants			1
they are also @entity12 with deep family histories in the @entity12			0
this is especially true of the @entity13 - origin population , the largest @entity40 subgroup and one that has been continually replenished by immigrant newcomers for a century			1
truly knowing what it means to be a person of @entity13 origin requires understanding the experiences of the nearly 3 in 10 ( 8.5 million ) @entity13 who were born in the @entity12 to @entity12 - born parents			1
these later - generation @entity13 - @entity12 ' experience in the @entity12 , though rooted in a distant past , is nonetheless deeply affected by current and uninterrupted immigration from their ancestral homeland			1
in some ways , @entity13 - @entity12 have lived what amounts to a classic tale of assimilation			1
they speak @entity56 ( and no @entity23 in the majority of cases ) , intermarry in large numbers , live in ethnically mixed neighborhoods , work in just about every imaginable profession , are honored on @entity63 and @entity64 , occupy important political positions and are highly patriotic			0
but ongoing @entity13 immigration puts a twist on this classic assimilation tale , making " @entity69 " relevant to later - generation @entity13 in both problematic and enjoyable ways			2
it can be tough being a member of an ethnic group that is so synonymous with immigration			0
even if their immigrant ancestors came early in the 20th century , continuous immigration means that @entity13 - @entity12 are never safe from erroneous assumptions that they are foreigners			1
surnames that end in " ski " or start with " o ' " are woven into the fabric of @entity12 ethnic surnames			0
but " @entity88 , " " @entity89 " and " @entity90 " remain bright threads that , combined with dark skin color , can make @entity13 - @entity12 and other @entity19 seem foreign in the eyes of others			1
ask the later - generation descendants of earlier waves of @entity13 immigrants , and they 'll tell you that " where are you from ... no , where are you really from ? " are questions that they have to field all too often			1
and even if it 's clear that they are @entity13 , they still get quizzed about how well they speak @entity23			0
assumptions about them being foreign turn from annoying to downright scary when law enforcement personnel suspect them of being illegal immigrants			2
but continuous immigration also makes being @entity13 - @entity12 enjoyable in some ways			1
while there is no shortage of people who see the growing @entity13 - origin population with alarm , there are also plenty of people who see the growth as an opportunity			1
corporations , retailers , political parties and churches are all trying to grab a slice of the " hispanic market , " the overwhelming majority of which is @entity13			0
retail marketing campaigns , sprinkles of the @entity23 language in political speeches and @entity13 - themed media are generally aimed at the immigrant audience			1
all of this attention adds cachet to @entity13 ancestry that even later - generation individuals enjoy			2
we live in a time when @entity12 often celebrates its ethnic vibrancy			0
people who are cut off from an immigrant population of the same ethnic origin have a hard time finding ways to celebrate their roots in any significant way , and they often lament being ethnically bland			0
@entity13 , in contrast , do n't have to worry about ethnic blandness because the opportunities to celebrate their heritage are all around			2
ongoing @entity13 immigration means constant access to the food , language , traditions , popular culture and customs that makes being @entity13 - @entity12 enjoyable			1
as we celebrate @entity17 and recognize all of the diversity among @entity19 , it begs the question : how do we know what it means to be @entity40 ? the answer can only be arrived at by appreciating the experiences of those @entity19 whose families have called the @entity12 home for several generations and those who more recently have come to call this land their home			0
no matter how deep or shallow their roots extend into @entity12 history , what almost all @entity19 have in common is that immigration profoundly defines their experience			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity11 : @entity13 - @entity12 often *perceived* only as immigrants
he says nearly a third were born in the @entity12 to parents also born in the @entity12
he says assumptions about @entity13 being foreign can be scary
@entity2 : @entity13 - @entity12 have a rich heritage to celebrate
