-- it 's one of the biggest data breaches in history			1
now that @entity4 has come clean -- sort of -- on a computer intrusion this month that exposed personal information on 77 million @entity8 users , one obvious question remains : who pulled off the hack ? in the old days , the answer would be simple : some kid did it			1
but today 's underground is more complicated -- a slew of competing players with different agendas and techniques			2
here 's a quick rundown on the likely suspects			2
@entity22 while noncriminal pranks are their stock in trade , the griefers of @entity22 have been on a hacktivism spree of late , staging distributed denial - of - service attacks against the corporate enemies of @entity30 , then famously cracking the computer security firm @entity32 and exposing the shady plotting of its ceo			2
coincidentally , @entity22 declared @entity4 as its latest protest target right around the time of the intrusion			2
they were unhappy with @entity4 's lawsuit against @entity43 rooter @entity41 , and unsatisfied by the settlement deal reached between @entity41 and the company this month			2
but spokespeople for @entity22 have denied any role in the @entity8 hack , and the whole flavor of the hack just is n't @entity22 ' style : they 've pulled intrusions in the past , but computer crime is n't their mainstay , and a stealth run through the network of a corporate giant is decidedly short on lulz			1
@entity59 : @entity4 to inspect @entity62 hacker 's hard drive @entity63 @entity63 hackers have been responsible for some of the most sophisticated known intrusions in recent years -- low - and - slow attacks against defense contractors , human rights groups and @entity71 bigwigs like @entity72			1
the attackers typically get in by hitting a single employee with an exploit , and then carefully expand through the network until they 've found what they 're looking for -- generally trade secrets , source code , or intelligence			0
a list of 77 million names , dates of birth and passwords could be useful as the raw material for future attacks , but aside from that , @entity4 's gaming infrastructure is not a logical target for this bunch			1
you also would n't expect a professional @entity63 intrusion to be detected so quickly			0
@entity93 recreational hacker this breed still exists , though now in much smaller numbers than the professionals			0
the @entity8 would be an alluring target for a bored teenager or twenty - something who spends a lot of time grinding through multiplayer shooters -- to paraphrase " @entity104 , " you covet what you see every day			1
a recreational hacker might go after the user database as a trophy			0
@entity59 : @entity4 claims @entity43 hacker sabotaged hard drive , skipped town for - profit cyberthief these guys , largely concentrated in @entity115 and @entity116 , know databases like the backs of their hands -- they dream in @entity120 -- and similar , if smaller , stolen databases are bought and sold routinely over carder forums and in private transactions			1
in this scenario , the credit card numbers potentially stolen in the hack are n't as important as they seem			0
according to @entity4 , the @entity127 -- the security code on the back of card -- was n't stored in the compromised database , which greatly reduces the cards ' usability to fraudsters			0
credit cards without the magstripe data or @entity127 are among the least valuable commodities			0
but combined with the other data , the database is valuable indeed			0
the passwords ( which @entity4 evidently did n't bother to hash ) could be a gold mine , because people have a tendency to use the same password everywhere ; you can bet a big chunk of those 77 million @entity8 passwords will unlock everything from @entity149 accounts to online banking			1
the e-mail addresses could be used in phishing attacks , with the fraudster using stolen details -- like the target 's date - of - birth -- to increase the chances of a response			1
hell , even if it were just sold as a spam list , the @entity4 database could draw a pretty penny			0
