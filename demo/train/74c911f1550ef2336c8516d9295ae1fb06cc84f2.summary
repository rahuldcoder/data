-- sen. @entity1 , @entity2 , said tuesday @entity4 should " use all means necessary " to prevent president @entity5 from granting what @entity1 considers amnesty to more immigrants who are in the country illegally			1
he said it would be " appropriate " to include a provision that would block the president from doing so in a critical government - funding bill that @entity4 must approve this month			0
@entity12 immediately seized on the issue and charged that @entity1 wants to shut down the government by attaching a " poison pill " to the funding bill , which is known as a continuing resolution or @entity17			1
@entity1 was at the center of last year 's government shutdown , which @entity12 believe did long term damage to the @entity22			1
" it 's another @entity1 hostage situation			1
last october he held the entire federal government hostage to his ideology and now he 's willing to do it again , " the chairman of the @entity26 @entity12 ' campaign arm , rep. @entity24 , @entity28 - @entity27 told @entity0			1
despite @entity1 's tough talk , there appears to be no appetite even among some of the @entity26 conservatives who pushed for a confrontation last fall to have a fight on the spending bill this close to the election			1
in the @entity42 , @entity22 leader @entity41 said he would n't allow another shutdown to happen			2
still , @entity44 maintained , " it 's deja vu all over again			1
in october as they were shutting down the government , they said they would n't shut down the government			0
they just ca n't be trusted			0
" @entity26 @entity22 are expected to vote thursday on a bill to extend current government - funding levels through december 11			0
at issue are @entity22 concerns the president will expand his use of the @entity58 program , which conservatives consider amnesty			0
that 's because earlier this summer the president vowed to use executive authority to take a number of steps related to immigration since @entity4 was gridlocked on the issue			0
the president has since said he wo n't take any unilateral action until after the midterm election			0
5 reasons @entity5 's delay on immigration is political but @entity1 said tuesday @entity22 should use " every tool at our disposal " including the @entity17			1
" i think we should use any and all means necessary to prevent the president from illegally granting amnesty			1
that certainly , i think , would be appropriate to include in the @entity17 , " @entity1 said at a news conference			2
" but i think we should use every -- every -- tool at our disposal			0
" @entity1 declined to say if he would vote against the @entity17 unless the provision is in the bill			2
" let 's wait to see what 's in the @entity17 , " @entity1 said			2
" i have a habit of waiting to see what 's in legislation before i make a decision about whether i will support it or not			0
" how far can the president go on executive actions ?			0

@entity1 says " any and all means necessary " should be used to stop " illegally granting amnesty "
@entity12 say @entity1 wants a government shutdown
he was at the center of last year 's shutdown
" it 's deja vu all over again , " says a @entity12 *congressional* leader
