@entity0 -- the @entity2 is weighing a possible military role to help the @entity5 revolt against leader @entity6 , but top @entity2 officials warn that the issue is controversial			1
secretary of state @entity9 told a @entity11 panel wednesday that " there may well be a role for military assets to get equipment and supplies into areas that have a need for them " and in areas where the @entity2 is welcome			2
but she noted the @entity22 statement issued wednesday that rejected " any foreign interference within @entity5 on behalf of the opposition , even though they have called for @entity6 to leave			1
" " the tough issues about how and whether there would be any intervention to assist those who are opposing @entity5 is very controversial within @entity5 and within the @entity33 community , " @entity26 told the @entity27			1
" so we are working closely with our partners and allies to try to see what we can do and we are engaged in very active consideration of all the different options that are available			2
" two senior officials in the @entity22 said the group 's members have agreed not to accept any foreign intervention in @entity5 ; they also agreed that they will consult with other @entity22 members in order to protect @entity5 ' security			1
but the league can not ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no - fly zone in coordination with the @entity53 if fighting were to continue , said @entity54 , chief of staff of the @entity22			1
senator @entity55 , @entity56 , called for the @entity2 to impose a no - fly zone over @entity5			1
while he noted that the @entity5 people were n't asking for foreign troops , he said they " do need the tools to prevent the slaughter of innocents on @entity5 streets			1
" defense secretary @entity64 , speaking to a @entity66 committee , said creating a no - fly zone would have to begin with an attack on @entity5			1
" if it 's ordered , we can do it , but ... there 's a lot of , frankly , loose talk about some of these military options , and let 's just call a spade a spade			0
a no - fly zone begins with an attack on @entity5 to destroy the air defenses			1
that 's the way you do a no - fly zone , and then you can fly planes around the country and not worry about our guys being shot down , " he told a @entity85 hearing			1
" but that 's the way it starts			0
" the administration is far from arming any opposition power , primarily because @entity2 officials still do n't know who the opposition is and what they are trying to achieve , senior @entity2 officials said			0
the @entity2 is trying to contact a variety of @entity5 in an attempt to figure out who the opposition is , but officials said no single group or individual has emerged in a leadership role			1
instead , the rebels appears to be composed of a wide and diverse group of @entity5 , including civilians formerly allied with @entity6 government , former military officers , longtime opponents of the regime and tribal leaders , the officials said			1
these various factions have divergent goals and perspectives : some are focused on their individual neighborhoods , others take a more regional or national approach			0
the sole unifying factor is they all oppose @entity6 , the officials said			0
the lack of a readily identifiable opposition leadership group can be traced to the fact that , during his nearly 42 years of iron rule , @entity6 has not allowed an opposition center of power to form , the officials said			1
though opposition members all want to replace @entity6 , they may not all be committed to a future democratic @entity5 , the officials said			1
" we are working to understand who is legitimate , who is not , but it is premature in our opinion to recognize one group or another , " @entity26 said wednesday			2
" we have to keep our focus at this point on helping the @entity5 people			2
and i think it 's important to recognize that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the motives , the opportunism , if you will , of people who are claiming to be leaders right now			0
" but pressure for international military intervention appears to be growing as the carnage mounts			0
some protesters have charged that troops loyal to @entity6 have fired on demonstrators , and military planes have bombed several sites held by the opposition			0
@entity5 's ambassador to the @entity2 estimated monday that as many as 2,000 people may have been killed			2
" i believe the global community can not be on the sidelines while airplanes are allowed to bomb and strafe , " said @entity55 , who chairs the @entity27			0
" a no - fly zone is not a long - term proposition , assuming the outcome is what all desire , and i believe that we ought to be ready to implement it as necessary			1
" @entity64 said taking such action would also require the @entity2 to put more air assets near @entity5 , because enforcing a no - fly zone would require a great deal of equipment			1
" it also requires more airplanes than you would find on a single aircraft carrier			2
so it is a big operation in a big country , " @entity64 said			2
the @entity2 military could speed up deployment of a second aircraft carrier if necessary to support a no - fly zone over @entity5 or other operations , according to chief of naval operations adm. @entity190			1
the @entity191 is scheduled to deploy from @entity192 , @entity193 , later this spring , @entity190 told reporters wednesday , though it could leave earlier			0
" that ship is ready , " he said			0
he emphasized that it was not his decision to accelerate the deployment			0
" that 's not my call			0
i get the forces ready to go and , so you know , that is an available asset , " @entity190 said			0
he also would not comment on whether a no - fly operation could be enforced over @entity5 from a single aircraft carrier			1
the carrier @entity208 is believed to be nearby in the @entity209			0
" that would depend on the tasking , " @entity190 said			0
two amphibious ships moved into the @entity213 tuesday with humanitarian response supplies such as water treatment equipment and temporary shelter , @entity190 said			0
@entity55 also said he was working on an aid package for the @entity218 , saying that a " significant financial commitment by the @entity2 " will be critical to help what he called a " monumental and uplifting transformation " in the region			2
@entity26 's appearance before the @entity27 was originally slated as a defense of president @entity226 's budget for 2012			0
she told lawmakers that it is important to continue counterterrorism programs in @entity231 , noting that some members of @entity233 had come from @entity5			2
@entity26 warned that one of the biggest @entity2 concerns is that " @entity5 could become a giant @entity236 " if the @entity2 is not active in the region			2
@entity1 's @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 contributed to this report			0
