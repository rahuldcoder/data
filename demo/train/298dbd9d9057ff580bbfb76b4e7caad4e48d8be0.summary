yesterday , members of the 114th @entity1 took the oath of office and ushered in a new @entity6 majority			1
it 's a fresh beginning for our country , and i 'm optimistic			1
a lot can be achieved if president @entity12 and his party work with us to advance common - sense jobs ideas for the middle class			1
in the @entity16 , we welcome many new senators determined to achieve serious results			1
these men and women share my party 's resolve to end @entity24 's dysfunction and get things done for the middle class again			1
the truth is , the @entity29 people no longer trust @entity24 to do the right thing			1
for many , it 's never seemed harder just to get by			1
many faced the reality of losing their health plan after being told they could keep it			2
many continue to struggle with rising medical costs that the president and his allies in @entity1 repeatedly told us would fall			2
confidence in the @entity43 wanes at home , while the world seems filled with chaos overseas			2
and yet , for years @entity24 has seemed uninterested or incapable of addressing their concerns ; for years , @entity24 seemed to be working for itself instead of for them			1
because the message voters sent in november was clear			2
they want the administration to change course and move to the middle , and they want dysfunction in the @entity16 to come to an end			2
the @entity29 people did n't ask for a government that tries to do everything and they did n't ask for a government that aims to do nothing			1
they want a government that works again			1
they want us to focus on more jobs , more opportunity , and more flexibility for a middle class that feels squeezed			2
@entity70 ideas with strong bipartisan support -- like simplifying our broken tax system , opening more markets to @entity29 - made products , and approving bipartisan infrastructure projects like the @entity76 -- provide a strong foundation for success			1
we plan to work to send that kind of common - sense legislation to the president for his signature			1
but to ensure the best outcome , two things will be needed			2
first , we need a @entity1 that functions again			2
having an effective @entity1 will help us move beyond an age of government by crisis			1
but it 's going to take significant changes to the way the @entity16 's been operating			2
the era we 've just been through -- with bipartisan jobs bills sent over from the @entity93 routinely killed , and senators ' serious jobs ideas regularly silenced â€” has to change			0
second , both parties need to make divided government work			1
this is where president @entity12 really comes in			0
his recent actions , including threatening to veto a bipartisan jobs project like the @entity76 within minutes of the new @entity1 being sworn in , have been anything but productive			0
the president himself has noted that the @entity29 people are counting on him to work with the @entity1 they elected to get things accomplished			1
now it 's time to show he meant it i hope he will			0
as we 've seen in the past , divided government is n't a reason to do nothing ; it 's often been a spur to achieve big things			1
@entity118 worked with @entity120 leaders to pass bold reforms to taxes and @entity123			0
a @entity1 worked with @entity124 to pass groundbreaking welfare reform			0
and if president @entity12 is interested in historic achievement , this can be his time , too			1
but bipartisan progress can only be achieved if president @entity12 is interested in it			0
he 's the only one who can bring his party on board or sign what @entity1 passes			0
it wo n't be easy for him			0
the president 's supporters are pressing for militancy , not compromise			0
but they need to understand that democracy is n't about what you can get away with , it 's about what you can achieve together			0
whatever the president decides , this @entity1 is going to function again			0
it 's going to legislate again for the people we were sent here to serve			0
some of the things we pass may seem significant ; some may seem more modest			0
and while we 're always going to be looking for areas where we can agree , it 's also okay if the president does n't love every bill @entity1 passes			0
the point is , our job is not to protect the president from good ideas			0
our job is to get the @entity16 back to work			1
our job is to focus on serious ideas designed to boost the middle class and help restore our nation 's promise for future generations			0
and that 's just what we plan to do .			0

@entity168 : @entity29 expect @entity24 to work for them
he says divided government can still yield historic achievement
