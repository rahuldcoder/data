@entity0 -- the @entity2 declared that its candidate won @entity5 's historic presidential election this weekend , making the claim hours after openly challenging the nation 's military rulers over its dissolution of parliament			1
with several million votes still to be counted , the state - run @entity12 news website around 4:15 a.m. monday ( 10:15 p.m. sunday et ) showed the @entity2 's @entity16 leading with about 5,648,000 votes compared with about 4,705,000 for opponent @entity18 , who served as @entity5 's last prime minister in the waning days of @entity21 's regime			1
yet the @entity23 group , citing what it said were all - but - complete official numbers released to its representatives at polling stations nationwide , asserted that @entity16 had won by capturing 52.5 % of the overall vote			1
the official vote count was scheduled to be finished at some point monday , with final results to be announced thursday			1
whoever they declare the winner will become the @entity37 nation 's first president since @entity21 , who was ousted in a wave of popular unrest last year after three decades in power			2
the next president will wade into a country with a political system mired in controversy , confusion and confrontation , much of it due to events over the past week			0
@entity5 has no constitution in place , though military rulers have vowed to appoint a 100 - person panel to craft such a document			0
and a court ruling just days before the runoff appeared to invalidate an @entity23 - dominated legislative body and then saw the military swiftly move to dissolve that parliament ahead of the election			1
but the @entity2 , whose @entity59 had won a majority of legislative seats , is bucking this act to dissolve parliament			1
@entity65 , a spokesman for the @entity23 group , called the move " unconstitutional " and said parliamentary speaker @entity68 will convene legislators on tuesday			0
" this parliament was chosen by 30 million voters over a period of three months , and the legislative power was handed to ( lawmakers ) chosen by the people , " @entity65 said			1
" it is unconstitutional to dissolve it			0
" and @entity78 , a @entity2 member and majority leader in the legislature , insisted sunday that parliament " has not been dissolved , " according to a report from the state - run @entity12 news agency			1
vowing the @entity2 wo n't " give it to a coup d'etat , " @entity78 said while casting his vote in @entity88 that military rulers must respect a march 30 constitutional declaration that gives only " the people " the authority to dissolve parliament			1
the @entity94 , meanwhile , issued a new constitutional declaration sunday night detailing some powers that the new president will hold , but gave little indication it was budging on the state of parliament			2
after being sworn in , the new president will set the date for parliamentary elections and can pardon and appoint government officials and ambassadors to foreign countries			0
but the military leadership stated that legislative power , as well as control of the national budget , will remain in its hands until a new parliament is elected			1
@entity113 " strongly rejected " the military declaration about parliament on its official @entity117 feed			2
the group also said that the constitutional panel picked by parliament will hold its first meeting monday to begin drafting a constitution , in defiance of the military council			2
there 's also plenty of dispute over the validity of this weekend 's presidential runoff vote , which @entity18 and @entity16 's campaigns accusing each other of election fraud			1
a wild election weekend for @entity5 , @entity134 and @entity135 turnout appeared sluggish sunday at some polling stations in @entity0 , where streets were mostly quiet despite what many @entity5 viewed as moves last week by military leaders , who have ruled the country since @entity21 was forced out in february 2011 , to hold on to power			1
some voters may have stayed home because of sweltering heat , officials told the state - run @entity12 newspaper			0
as of 4 p.m. sunday in @entity5 , 40 % of the nation 's 50 million eligible voters had cast ballots , according to @entity153 , the head of @entity5 's @entity154			2
in the first round of voting last month , 46 % of voters participated			0
officials have reported few voting irregularities in the second round of elections , @entity153 said			0
to protect the balloting process , authorities went so far as to camp outside polling stations overnight during the runoff			0
at one station designated for women in @entity0 , guards slept on the doorstep			0
the @entity169 approved licenses for 53 organizations to observe the elections , including at least three international groups -- the @entity174 - based @entity171 , the @entity176 - based @entity175 in @entity176 and the @entity177			0
yet @entity18 's campaign filed " several complaints " with @entity153 's commission , alleging the @entity2 committed " systemic violations			1
" specifically , they accused the @entity23 group 's supporters of bribing voters with " large sums of money and food " to back @entity16 , as well as using " intimidation , threats and violence against supporters of candidate @entity18			1
" the former prime minister 's camp also said it " filed more than 100 official complaints accusing the brotherhood of ballot rigging and stuffing			0
" " the @entity2 's systematic election violations prove how the ( group ) does not believe in freedom of choice and democracy unless this democracy brings them to power , " @entity18 's campaign said in a statement			1
" the organized and persistent election fraud by the @entity2 proves they ... only talk the talk and never walk the walk of liberal democracy			1
" in a statement on its website , the @entity2 flatly denied what it called " false reports being circulated " and urged election officials to promptly investigate what it called " games and plots			2
" it also accused " the rival candidate 's supporters ( of ) paying cash bribes to some voters , " among other allegations			2
outside the city , in @entity225 , @entity224 cast his ballot for @entity16 even as he questioned whether the election was fairly handled			2
" i do n't believe the @entity5 presidential elections are fair to begin with , " he said sunday morning			0
" the military council , assisted by the elections committee , tried everything to stall and influence the process , from disqualifying previous candidates before the first round -- not to mention the negative campaigns against @entity16 -- while keeping quiet about @entity18			1
" " but despite all ( this ) , i do n't believe that there has been any electoral fraud			0
the ballots will determine what is next for @entity5			0
" the real obstacle to democracy in @entity5 some disgruntled voters launched a campaign to invalidate ballots , said @entity247 , the founder of a group that marked " x " on the names of both @entity16 and @entity18 , thereby nullifying their vote			1
among the boycotters was @entity253 , who said he lost sight in his left eye from a police beating in @entity257 during the early 2011 protests			0
" if i give this country for the @entity2 hands , there is not going to be any more @entity5 , it will be destroyed , " he told @entity1			0
" and if i give it to someone from the old system , it looks like we did nothing			0
" what is the @entity2 ? @entity1 's @entity269 , @entity270 and @entity271 and journalists @entity272 and @entity274 contributed to this report .			2
