@entity4 troops retook the strategic northeastern town of @entity7 -- where hundreds were viciously killed in a @entity10 attack last month -- on saturday , the @entity2 nation 's top military spokesman said			1
in a statement , maj. gen. @entity11 said that " a large number of terrorists ... drowned " in @entity15 and others were killed in the fighting to take the fishing town			0
@entity15 touches four countries -- @entity4 , @entity15 , @entity22 and @entity23 -- all of which have been targeted in recent weeks by @entity10 , the @entity25 extremist group blamed for ongoing horrific attacks , abductions and other abuses			1
according to @entity11 , @entity4 troops entered @entity7 early saturday morning and , hours later , moved into a " comprehensive ... search phase ( to ) mop up arms and ammunition and also apprehend any terrorist who might be hiding in the vicinity			1
" the operation in @entity7 was one of about a dozen being carried out in the region , all part of a @entity4 offensive aimed at ultimately crushing the terrorist group			1
" the troops are now dominating and conducting aggressive patrols ... , " @entity11 said			2
" the morale of troops remain high			1
" @entity10 's stated goal is to bring its extreme , twisted version of @entity49 law to the masses			1
in the process , it 's brought terror -- attacking churches and mosques , bombing crowded markets and raiding once peaceful villages , even kidnapping people young and old , most famously the more than 200 girls taken last april from a school in @entity61			0
and given its location along @entity15 in @entity64 , about 110 miles north of the state capital of @entity66 , @entity7 has frequently found itself in the middle of this violence			0
this reached a bloody crescendo in early january , when @entity10 stormed @entity7 and surrounding towns in what @entity73 said " could be @entity10 's deadliest act			2
" the @entity25 militants sprayed bullets as they stormed the area in trucks and armored vehicles , according to local authorities			2
some stopped only to hop onto motorcycles and chase residents who had fled into the bush , firing indiscriminately , said @entity86 , a local district head local officials reported death tolls ranging from hundreds to as many as 2,000 people			0
" dead bodies litter the bushes in the area and it is still no â€Ž t safe to go and pick them ( up ) for burial , " @entity90 , the chairman of the local government where @entity7 is located , said then			0
" some people who hid in their homes were burned alive			0
