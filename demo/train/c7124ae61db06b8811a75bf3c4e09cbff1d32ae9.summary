-- out with seekers and brooms			0
in with stirrups and hooves			0
this is horseball , where rugby meets basketball on horseback -- but players have more fun comparing it to quidditch , the sport of @entity14 's wizarding world			1
" i usually ask people if they 've seen the @entity14 movies , " says @entity16 horseball player @entity15			2
" @entity19 is the nearest comparison i can think of			0
that usually gets people going			0
" while @entity14 and teammates pick up gruesome injuries with disturbing ease playing quidditch , full - contact horseball does at least feature helmets			2
" it looks a little bit violent , but it is n't , " says @entity29 , the sport 's president , who began playing as a teenager in his native @entity32			1
" the horses are very well - prepared and there are rules to protect both the horse and the rider			0
it 's intensive , but it 's safe			2
" as @entity16 horseball pioneer @entity52 puts it : " people have a go at you , that you ' should n't be doing that with an animal , ' but we only have one horse -- so we want to end up with it at the end of the game , in the condition it started in			1
" horseball games last 20 minutes , in which teams of six -- four horses per side at any one time -- try to shoot a junior football with leather handles into an oversized basketball net			1
at the highest level , you can expect up to 20 goals per game			2
players can tackle each other , so horses and riders do come into contact , and one of the game 's signature moves involves riders swooping low to pluck the ball off the ground , without dismounting			1
that requires the game 's only specialist riding equipment , a " pickup strap " which ties the stirrups together , allowing competitors to lean far below their horse , collecting the ball without falling off			1
" that 's our little secret , " laughs @entity29			2
" for spectators , it looks fantastic when players do that , but for people picking up the ball , it 's not that difficult			1
" the sport 's passing , movement and some strategies share similarities with rugby and basketball , but horseball first appeared in 1970s @entity99 as a descendant of pato , @entity103 's national game			1
@entity104 is centuries old and looks more like polo -- early players once used a duck in a basket as the " ball " -- whereas horseballers say their sport offers a more modern , spectator - friendly experience			1
" i believe this is one of the most exciting equestrian sports , " says @entity29			2
" it 's a team sport , when equestrian sports tend to be individual sports , and the gear is not expensive			1
" to start horseball , you do n't have to have a lot of riding skills			0
you just have to be comfortable on a horse			0
" @entity52 , who founded the @entity124 club in the 1990s , adds : " it 's the team aspect			1
in the other equestrian sports , like dressage and jumping , the team event just means you 're relying on each other for points			1
" in horseball , you rely on each other the same way you would in a football match			0
" @entity136 encourages men and boys to stay riding longer			1
the participation is about 50 - 50 , men and women			0
" @entity15 , who works at a nuclear power station when not playing , is testament to that			0
he says horseball kept him riding as a teenager			0
" i was about 14 , and i was leaning more towards football and rugby , " he recalls			0
" but my uncle had a space on his horseball team and i did n't really look back			2
it kept me involved in horses			0
" on the team this year there 's me , two of my sisters , another lad that 's played for about 15 years , and two girls who used to play for @entity157 -- one is a doctor and the other is an accountant			2
" the @entity99 , inventors of the game , still dominate the sport			1
@entity15 believes @entity99 's senior men 's team has never been beaten at international level			1
( he also complains that his @entity16 team , like @entity170 's footballers , are " not as good as we should be			2
" ) @entity29 says more than 80 % of the world 's players hail from @entity99 , while @entity52 was inspired to start horseball in the @entity16 when he saw a @entity99 demonstration at the 1991 @entity174			1
but @entity29 believes his sport can expand quickly in years to come , beginning with a chance to showcase horseball as a demonstration sport at this august 's @entity178 in @entity179			1
" we now have 18 countries playing horseball , " says @entity29			0
" we have already had two @entity184 , there is a @entity185 , and there are some national championships			0
" i believe , in five to 10 years , this will be one of the biggest equestrian sports			0
last month i was at an equine fair in @entity194 and they were crazy for horseball , it was basketball on horseback			1
" we even have horseball in @entity199 at the moment , " he adds , " but they are on the other side of the world , and sometimes they try to do their own thing			0
" that makes @entity52 chuckle			0
" the @entity199 can be quite ... physical			0
when they go to international competitions , they find they have n't really read the rules properly			0
" @entity136 's next move is expansion into the @entity212			1
the players , however , have bigger dreams			0
" they say that if @entity216 had got the @entity217 , instead of @entity124 , horseball would have been looked at as an @entity219 event , " says @entity15			1
" i was one of the few who was slightly disappointed when @entity124 got the @entity219			2
" @entity52 adds : " personally , i think this would make an excellent @entity219 sport			1
" whereas the horse world is always very good at attracting its own , horseball attracts people who are n't even interested in horses			0

@entity136 mixes rugby and basketball on horseback in teams of six
@entity99 dominates the sport , which has its origins in @entity103 's national game , pato
players say horseball is one of the only " true " team events in equestrian sport
@entity136 is coming to the @entity212 and the sport has future @entity219 ambitions
