with one hand , @entity0 clutches a purse that matches her red blouse and skirt trimmed in blue			2
in the other , she holds an @entity6			2
peering through her blue veiled hijab , the traditional @entity9 head cover , the petite 25 - year - old watches as the man in a military uniform with no insignia shows her how to switch off the rifle 's safety , take aim and fire			1
then it 's her turn			2
in red ballerina flats , she positions herself , levels the @entity6 toward a thick patch of date palms and pulls the trigger			2
bang ! the feel of the weapon discharging a round startles her a bit			2
" then you turn the safety on and lower the weapon , " the man tells her			2
this is day one of a five - day course being offered by the @entity36 , a powerful @entity37 militia with an estimated 10,000 members , to the wives , mothers , sisters and daughters of the group			1
@entity44 : @entity46 towns , oil fields taken over by @entity48 @entity49 is not training to go to the front line to fight the @entity51 in @entity46 and @entity52 and its allied @entity54 militants , but rather to defend her home if the terror group makes its way into @entity59 and ignites sectarian fighting in the streets			1
with most of the men in her family leaving home to volunteer to fight @entity48 and its allies , @entity49 says she has no choice now but to learn how to fight			1
" i must do this , " she says			2
more than 450 women have been through the training since the group started it this year , a step that was taken after @entity48 began its battle for the flashpoint city of @entity77 in @entity78 -- a battle that was a bellwether of things to come in @entity46			1
and thousands more are waiting , says maj. @entity81 of the @entity36 , sitting in his office in a fortified compound in @entity84 , a mixed @entity37 - @entity54 neighborhood in @entity59			1
the number of women volunteers swelled in june after @entity48 seized @entity46 's second - largest city , @entity88 , and then began a march on the @entity46 capital , vowing to hit the city of more than 7 million people and overthrow the @entity37 - dominated government			1
" we are training these ladies to make them ready if ( @entity48 ) makes it into their neighborhood , " @entity81 said			1
" they will be the ones who have to defend their home			0
" who is the @entity48 ? memories of past violence @entity49 remembers the sectarian fighting -- @entity105 , sometimes neighbor vs. neighbor -- at the height of the @entity109 that nearly tore the country apart			1
her older brother , 36 - year - old @entity49 , was among the thousands who reportedly disappeared during the fighting			1
the last time she ever saw him was the morning of may 28 , 2007 , when he left their home in @entity120 , a @entity54 - dominated city of about 500,000 people dubbed the " @entity124 to @entity59 " because of its proximity to the @entity46 capital			1
she does n't know what happened to him			0
but she and her family believe he was a victim of the sectarian fighting			0
" maybe somebody kidnapped him ? " she says , looking down at the gun in her hand			0
" maybe he was killed in an explosion ? " ask any of the women , who range between the ages of 14 and 60 , at the @entity36 training center if their family has a " martyr " -- somebody who has been killed in the fighting -- and nearly three - quarters of the hands go up			1
ask if any of them know of anybody who 's one , and everybody 's hands go up			0
@entity147 is the man in the military uniform instructing the women			1
he is not related to @entity0 , but she could be his daughter			0
by the time the week is done , he says , the women will be proficient enough to protect themselves and , if necessary , kill			1
teen learning to protect her family fourteen - year - old @entity153 sits against the trunk of a towering date palm , listening to @entity49			1
an @entity6 lays across her lap. her tender age is evident by the white hijab she wears			0
the other women , all older , wear hijabs in dark colors			1
her mother , @entity163 , already knows how to use the weapon			0
she is an @entity46 police officer , one of the thousands of women who were trained in such roles when the @entity169 military was standing up @entity46 's military			2
she also was among the first to complete the @entity36 training , and today she is helping to instruct the women at the training center to handle the weapons			1
@entity153 must learn how to protect the family , specifically her 7 - year - old brother @entity175 , she says			1
" when her father and i are at work , what is she going to do if someone comes in the house to kill them ? " with school out for the summer , most of @entity153 's friends , she says , are watching television and reading magazines			0
she asked them to volunteer with her , but only a few did , she said			0
when its @entity193 's turn to fire , she moves to the front of the group			2
" so i take aim like this , and i get ready to fire , " @entity49 says , lifting the @entity6 and leveling it toward the trees			2
" he hands it to @entity193 , who follows his instruction			0
bang ! @entity206 shot , he tells her			0
her mother , wearing a green camouflage headscarf that matches her uniform , smiles at her and gently pats her on her back			0
it 's not what a mother wishes for her daughter , @entity213 said			0
" but in @entity46 , this is the reality			0
" by the end of the lesson , @entity193 appears more at ease with the @entity6 , cradling the weapon in her arm -- just like she has seen soldiers on the streets do			0
but could she kill somebody ? could she point the gun at somebody and pull the trigger ? she thinks about the questions for a moment and then looks to her mother before she answers			0
" if @entity234 wills it , yes , " she says			0
