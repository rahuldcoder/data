-- the ice moves inexorably ashore , crackling as it goes like thousands of windows breaking			1
in minutes , it 's moved from the shoreline of a @entity6 lake to the walls of homes along the lake			1
" it was just pushing and breaking and pushing and breaking , " @entity10 , who made a video of saturday 's " ice tsunami " on @entity13 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity14 in @entity15			2
@entity10 's video had more than 275,000 views on @entity19 by monday morning			0
and once you watch it , you ca n't stop			0
it 's like a sci - fi movie , and there 's certainly science involved			0
@entity26 , a conservation officer for the area with the @entity28 , said the weather event works like this : strong winds blow heavy chunks of ice out in the lake toward the shore			1
those chunks heave up bits of lighter , melting ice closer to shore up on the land			1
the more the wind blows , the more ice comes onto land			2
" it basically has the same mechanism of an iceberg , " said @entity43 , a @entity0 meteorologist			0
" winds , but more so ocean currents , allow icebergs to drift			2
same premise : a chunk of ice ( relatively shallow ) was pushed by a strong , sustained wind			1
the momentum of the ice sheet overcame the friction of the land			2
" @entity26 said the ice came about 60 feet to 80 feet inland saturday , getting as high as 30 feet in some places			1
the ice mass covered up about 2.5 miles of shoreline , he said			2
at least one home had 2 to 3 feet of ice spill through its patio glass doors , and some boathouses along the lake were destroyed , he said			1
it was something @entity26 , who 's only been stationed on @entity13 for a few months , had n't seen before			0
but longtime locals told him they could n't remember anything similar since the 1950s			0
the same phenomenon was seen friday on @entity72 in @entity73 , about 75 miles northwest of @entity74 , where a wall of ice up to 30 feet high destroyed six homes and damaged 14 others , according to a report from the @entity80 " this is worse than a flood , because with a flood , the water just goes through and it 's finished			1
with this , there 's still so much ice out on the lake that if the wind picks up again , it could start all over , " homeowner @entity85 told the @entity80			2
" you know you 've got cement , concrete blocks and steel , and the ice goes through it like it 's just a toothpick , " @entity91 , who also lost a home to the ice , told the @entity80			0
" it just shows the power			0
there is nothing you can do ; you just get out of the way and just watch			0
" in @entity6 on monday , people were watching the ice there melt , a steady rain helping the process , @entity26 said			1
temperatures on tuesday expected to be in the 80s or higher were also expected to help , both with the ice onshore and the larger sheet now 200 to 300 yards out into the lake , he said			0
still , that ice mass was about 16 inches thick monday , and the weather can change quickly in @entity6			1
" it 's not as significant as it was , " @entity26 said , " but you never know with what @entity119 does			0

strong winds push melting ice onto *lakeshore* in @entity6
twenty homes also destroyed or damaged in @entity128 , report says
