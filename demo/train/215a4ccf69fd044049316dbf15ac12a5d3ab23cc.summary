@entity0 -- thousands of protesters held hands and encircled the @entity6 grounds on sunday , demanding president @entity2 reject a proposed oil pipeline that would stretch between @entity8 and @entity9			1
" stop the pipeline , yes we can ! " the environmental activists chanted about the 1,700 - mile @entity12 project			1
until last week , the @entity6 had said final decision on the pipeline would be up to the @entity16 , following an environmental impact analysis and a public commenting period			1
but @entity2 has implied recently that he may step in			2
those gathered sunday afternoon in @entity0 -- from as far north as @entity20 , as far south as @entity21 and as far west as @entity22 , said organizers -- hoped public pressure would persuade the president			0
" we need to remind him he is the leader who we elected , " @entity26 , a former member of the @entity27 and now executive director of the @entity29 , told the crowd			0
" ( we need him ) to give back some of the hope he gave us three years ago			0
" she was among several who began speaking around 2 p.m. , in addition to @entity39 rep. @entity38 , @entity40 , actor @entity41 , @entity42 of the progressive @entity44 group @entity43 and scientist @entity45			0
many people in the crowd wore orange vests that read , " stop the pipeline , " while a few dressed as polar bears			1
a large model of a black pipeline was held aloft and walked around the @entity6 several times			1
" i 'm hoping to @entity57 that the president , or whatever higher power , will use rational sense and understand that people do n't want this , " @entity53 , a senior and environmental studies major at the @entity55 , said of the project			1
pipeline operator @entity63 says on its website that the $ 13 billion pipeline " will play an important role in linking a secure and growing supply of @entity8 crude oil with the largest refining markets in the @entity39 , significantly improving @entity70 security supply			1
" @entity63 says it " is devoted to minimizing its environmental impact " in creating and operating @entity12			1
" in all cases , great care and planning will be taken to minimize and avoid impacts to the environment , including rare or endangered species , habitat , significant water crossings , and historical and paleontological resources , " the company says			1
while saying it is ready to respond to any leak or crisis , @entity63 stresses that it believes pipelines " are safe and the chance of a significant spill is remote			1
" " pipelines are the safest , most reliable , economical and environmentally favorable way to transport oil and petroleum products , " says the company			0
yet environmental activists have decried the project , with the @entity29 calling it " potentially catastrophic			1
" the pipeline would transport toxic crude oil from under @entity8 's boreal forest , home to many @entity70 songbirds , to refineries in @entity9 , according to the @entity102			2
the process threatens rivers and communities along the way , said the group , which was one of the chief organizers of sunday 's event			0
environmentalists additionally are urging the president to block construction in the spirit of his 2008 campaign promise to move the country away from fossil fuels			0
@entity26 told @entity1 that she felt a @entity16 review of the project is flawed , adding that she feels @entity2 needs to stand up to " big oil			2
" @entity122 , the @entity123 's executive director , said from the rally that he felt the activist push against the pipeline is surging			2
he added that he fully expects @entity2 to reject the project			2
@entity26 said that the arrests of hundreds of activists over the summer " brought the issue into the radar			0
" while he has n't made a decision , the president chimed in about the project in an interview last week with @entity1 affiliate @entity136 in @entity137 , @entity22			2
" folks in @entity22 , like folks all across the country , are n't going to say to themselves , ' we 're going to take a few thousand jobs if it means our kids are potentially drinking water that would damage their health , ' " @entity2 said			1
" when somebody gets sick , that 's a cost that society has to bear as well			0
so these are all things that you have to take a look at when you make these decisions			0
" the president said his priority is to ensure residents are not at risk			0
" there 's a way of doing that and making sure the health and safety of the people of @entity22 are protected , " he said			0
" and that 's how i 'll be measuring these recommendations when they come to me			0
