-- things are looking horrible for president @entity2			1
there 's the @entity5 website fiasco			2
ongoing allegations of @entity7 spying on @entity9 leaders			0
there was the government shutdown that damaged the economy on his watch			0
and a new poll released this week finds @entity2 with his lowest approval rating -- and his highest disapproval rating -- ever			1
if this were a movie , we would be at the part where the hero finds himself surrounded			1
he has no escape routes and he 's outgunned			0
what will happen next : will our hero prevail like @entity27 in " @entity28 , " or will he fail like @entity29 in " @entity30 " ? well , the good news for @entity2 is that the script for the final scenes of his presidency has not been written yet			1
the bad news is that he may not be the one writing it			0
simply put : @entity2 is not the protagonist driving his own story			1
rather , his storyline is being dictated by others			0
no question , he has long had trouble controlling the narrative , with a @entity47 bent on denying him , basically , everything he wants			1
but now he 's heading toward the end of his final term -- and the clock is ticking on his agenda			1
@entity2 's main antagonist , of course , is the hyper - partisan @entity55 that refuses to agree on the most basic issues , such as raising the debt ceiling , which @entity55 has done more than 40 times since 1980			1
and unless something changes , it 's looking bad for immigration reform , universal background checks for gun purchases , income tax reform or any of the other proposals he outlined in his @entity64 nine months ago			0
perhaps the worst thing about the problems with the @entity5 website is that they occurred at a time when things were finally looking politically brighter for @entity2			1
though the government shutdown had been an unwelcome setback , polls showed after it ended that @entity77 blamed the @entity47 in @entity55 for it much more than they blamed him			1
it looked as if @entity2 had righted his ship and would be able to refocus @entity77 on his priorities			2
it was as if @entity2 had become @entity83 as the captain of the fishing boat in " @entity86			2
" the rain has stopped , the ocean is turning calm and there is even a glimmer of sunlight ; he 's beaten the storm			0
but then moments later , the sky darkens and there is a deluge of rain			0
the choppy waters ( in this case , the @entity5 website debacle ) soon consume the ship			0
is this @entity2 's metaphoric fate ? he can accept another plotline -- let 's say of " gravity , " with @entity2 as a character like @entity106 's , hit with one harrowing challenge after another			1
this may be exciting to watch , but not great for the character , who has no idea what will happen next			2
i 'd recommend a different story line			0
i 'd use the ending of " @entity116 " as inspiration and metaphorically go out with guns blazing			0
why not set some lofty goals that will frame the agenda anew going forward ? first , @entity2 should announce that retaking control of the @entity122 in 2014 is a top priority			1
yes , many districts have been gerrymandered to all but ensure re-election for @entity47 @entity122 members			1
but he should take the fight to his adversaries anyway			0
unseating some tea party @entity122 members has become newly possible after the shutdown mess			2
their approval ratings are just below toe fungus			0
can the president maneuver through this new landscape and turn it to his advantage ? even getting more moderate republicans into the @entity122 could be a step toward sanity			2
( sometimes you have to improvise to make a story line work			0
) @entity2 should also use executive orders to the extent legally possible to attain his policy objectives			1
he did this very thing in 2011 when he ordered that many children of parents illegally in the @entity77 would no longer be deported			0
sure , the @entity47 will push back -- they will say @entity2 is behaving like a " king " or " tyrant " and complain about him nightly on @entity152			1
but the upside is that the debate will be about the issues the president has chosen			0
it 's denouement time for @entity2 as we enter the final act of his presidency			2
will the president 's agenda continue to be dictated by others , making him nothing more than a lame duck , caretaker president ? or will he use every means at his discretion to write his own story ? @entity2 is the star of this movie			1
the only question is : how is it going to end ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			2

@entity177 : @entity2 in a tough *stretch* , facing policy debacles , low poll numbers
if it were a movie , his character would be surrounded -- but he can change outcome , he says
he says he must *aggressively* press agenda and also aim for @entity187 to retake @entity122
@entity177 : @entity47 dictating narrative , but he must take control before term runs out
