@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 needs to undergo mental health examinations , the judge in his murder trial ruled wednesday , putting a halt to the proceedings after nearly two months of testimony			1
the very unusual move throws the trial into confusion			1
how long 's the trial delayed ? we do n't know yet			2
judge @entity15 will formally issue her ruling on tuesday			0
by that time , she should know who will do the evaluation of @entity5 and when and where it will take place			1
at that point , it should be somewhat clearer when the trial will resume -- if it does at all			0
how long will the evaluations take ? a minimum of 30 days			1
will @entity5 have to live in an institution ? judge @entity15 hopes he will not			1
she said she did not intend to " punish the accused twice " by putting him in a situation where he had to be locked up , and asked if he could be evaluated as an outpatient			0
@entity5 should learn the answer on tuesday			1
neither side believes he 's mentally ill , so what 's this all about ? the defense team put a psychiatrist , dr. @entity38 , on the stand to testify that @entity5 suffers from " generalized anxiety disorder			1
" the disorder means he has " excessive " concerns about security , and that he felt threatened even when , objectively , he was not , she testified			0
prosecutor @entity45 seized on the psychiatrist 's testimony , arguing that if the defendant 's mental health is even potentially an issue in the trial , he needed to be referred for expert evaluation			2
the defense is not arguing that mental illness played a role in @entity5 shooting and killing his girlfriend @entity56 , so they opposed the motion			1
but after considering the question overnight , @entity15 granted the prosecution request			0
was @entity62 's push for tests a total surprise ? what 's his strategy ? yes			0
it 's incredibly unusual for the prosecution -- rather than the defense -- to argue that a defendant might have defense of insanity			2
@entity62 seems to be placing a high - stakes bet that experts will disagree with the evidence of dr. @entity38			0
how will finding on mental state affect the trial ? the expert panel evaluating @entity5 has three options			1
they could find that @entity5 was mentally incapacitated when he shot @entity56 , which would end the trial immediately in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness			1
that would lead to the athlete being committed to a mental institution until he is ruled not to be a danger			0
the doctors could also find that he had " diminished responsibility " at the time he killed @entity56			0
in that case , the trial would resume , and the experts ' finding would be taken into consideration during sentencing if he is found guilty			2
the third possibility is that the experts could disagree with the defense psychiatrist and say that @entity5 ' mental health is not an issue at all			1
if that happens , @entity38 's testimony could be disregarded			0
the experts might not all agree with each other , and lawyers on either side could disagree with the experts ' report , leading to any number of possible outcomes			0
if there is any dispute , the final decision about what to do with the experts ' report lies with the judge			0
is this good or bad for @entity5 ? it all depends on what the mental health experts decide			1
if they agree with @entity38 or find he was incapacitated , that will help @entity5			2
in one respect , though , the ruling is not to his advantage : it pushes off the end of his trial , leaving him in legal limbo at least another few months .			2

a surprise order for mental testing for @entity5 raises questions for his trial
testing will last at least 30 days , pushing off the end of the trial
a prosecution move for mental *observation* is very unusual
how the move affects @entity5 and the verdict depends on what experts decide
