@entity1 , @entity0 -- managing expenses on the road does n't have to be a struggle , even in the most expensive city in the world			0
and what @entity9 loses in costliness , it easily makes up with nature			0
the city sits on the innermost part of the @entity14 , with forested hills , more than 40 islands and 343 lakes			1
for the best views catch a ferry from @entity20			1
or better still take a cruise			2
the @entity22 , that provides access to 33 museums as well as free travel on public transport , also offers a free lunch cruise on board a traditional wooden sailing ship			1
you get a @entity33 prawn buffet as part of the deal and two - hour trip around the city 's islands and lakes			0
boats leave at 10.30 , 13.00 and 15.30			0
@entity9 's most visited site is @entity42 that houses more than 200 huge , some say @entity45 , sculptures by celebrated @entity33 artist @entity46			1
