@entity0 -- @entity2 , the former @entity3 producer and best - selling author known for his @entity6 essays on the courtroom travails of the rich and famous , died wednesday in @entity0 after a long battle with bladder cancer			1
@entity2 wrote five best selling books and covered high society crimes for @entity6			1
@entity12 , who described himself as " a high - class @entity14 , " was 83			1
called " @entity2 " by his friends , @entity12 was putting the finishing touches on his final novel , which he said he planned to call " @entity21 , " when his health took a turn for the worse			1
he flew to @entity22 earlier this month for another round of stem cell treatments at the same @entity26 clinic where the late @entity27 was treated			1
he was hospitalized upon his return to @entity0 , then sent home			2
as a correspondent for @entity6 magazine , @entity12 was a fixture at some of the most famous trials of our times -- @entity37 , @entity38 , the @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			1
he discovered his magazine writing career in his 50s , through personal tragedy -- his daughter 's murder			2
he vented his anger at the legal system in " justice : a father 's @entity51 of his daughter 's killer , " following the murder trial of @entity56 , the estranged boyfriend who strangled 22 - year - old @entity57 , in 1982			2
@entity56 spent fewer than three years in prison			2
@entity12 's article was published by @entity6 and he accepted then - editor @entity60 's offer to write full - time for the magazine			1
calling himself a " diarist , " @entity12 dropped bold - faced names as he spilled behind - the - scenes nuggets gleaned from courtrooms and dinner parties alike			1
" it is fair to say that the halls of @entity6 will be lonelier without him and that , indeed , we will not see his like anytime soon , if ever again , " said editor @entity74 in a tribute posted on the magazine 's web site			1
he bristled at one writer 's oft - repeated description of him as " @entity80 in pants			2
" he preferred to be known as a crime victim 's advocate and frequently spoke at events sponsored by victims ' groups			0
the fact he personally knew many of the people he wrote about set @entity12 apart from other crime writers			1
@entity12 wrote that he met music producer @entity42 for dinner three times during the @entity40 murder trial			1
" he knew every detail of the trial and story , " @entity12 wrote			1
" he carried a gun when we saw each other , but he never pulled it on me			0
" @entity42 later became a defendant in a trial @entity12 covered			1
he spoke to @entity1 in june , while promoting the @entity103 release of a documentary of his life called " @entity106			0
" at the time , he said he was feeling well , happy , and hopeful the treatments were working			1
" i 'm pro stem cell , " he said			1
but even then , he seemed to know he was in a race against time			0
" i want to have one more best seller , before i cool , " @entity12 said			1
" it 's wonderful to have a best seller			0
" he said his personal story puts the lie to the claim by another high society writer , the late @entity118 @entity117 , that there are no second acts in life			0
" this is the third act , " @entity12 said			1
" i have a novel coming out			0
i finally got it finished in the clinic ... i 'm calling it ' too much money			0
' that 's a hooking title			0
" @entity12 looked back on his life during the hour - long lunchtime phone chat			1
he said he had just one regret -- his failed marriage to his wife , @entity136 , who died in 1997			0
the couple never formally divorced			0
" i loved that marriage , " he said			0
" @entity136 was the love of my life			0
and yet i ruined it			0
i was n't formed yet			0
the regret is that i hurt her			0
" @entity144 , @entity145 's executive vice president , recalled @entity12 as " a master storyteller ... who always kept his eye on the human story behind the crimes			1
" besides hosting his own show on @entity145 , @entity12 appeared frequently on @entity1 's " @entity152			1
" " @entity2 was one of the finest people i 've known , " @entity153 said			0
" he was a terrific writer , a raconteur , and a familiar face on ' @entity152 ' for many years			0
he was a wonderful human being			0
" in court , @entity12 always dressed impeccably , wearing dark jackets and gray flannels , sharply starched shirts complete with cufflinks and club - style ties			1
he used a fountain pen to jot notes in small bound notebooks			0
he was unabashedly pro-prosecution , although he said he " lost no sleep " over @entity170 's acquittal on a charge of killing his wife , and was troubled by @entity174 's conviction on lying to investigators about a stock deal			0
when @entity40 's acquittal was announced in 1995 , @entity12 's jaw dropped and the courtroom cameras caught his expression			1
it became an iconic image			0
@entity40 later was found liable in a wrongful death suit and ordered to pay more than $ 33 million to the victims ' families			0
@entity12 had been battling cancer for several years -- a fight that became widely known when he collapsed in court last year while covering @entity40 's @entity191 armed robbery trial			1
he was n't in court to see @entity40 sentenced to prison			0
@entity12 's life story reads like one of his novels			1
he was born to a well - to - do family in @entity201 , @entity202 , in 1925 ; his father was a cardiac specialist			2
@entity12 attended preppy @entity204 , and fought in the @entity205 , winning the @entity206			2
he later found work in @entity0 as a stage manager for " the @entity210 , " a popular kids ' show when television was in its infancy			2
he moved to @entity3 , rubbing elbows with the biggest names in show business during the 1960s , and became a movie producer			2
but he soon became addicted to alcohol and drugs , hit bottom and became his own worst nightmare -- a nobody			0
he sobered up and retired to a one - room cabin in @entity226 to write his first novel , then headed back to @entity0 with just a suitcase and his typewriter			2
in 1985 , @entity12 wrote his first best - seller , " the two mrs. @entity232 , " loosely based on a society killing			1
that success was followed by " @entity234 , " " @entity235 , " " a season in @entity237 , " and , following the @entity40 trial , " @entity239			0
" his brother , the late @entity12 , was an accomplished author and was married to @entity240 , a wit and famous writer			2
in fact , @entity12 has said , he was so daunted by their talent that it probably delayed the start of his own writing career by decades			2
asked if he believed in past lives , @entity12 , ever the firm believer in second acts , said : " i believe in future ones			2
