-- the cricket player who helped spark apartheid - era @entity2 's sporting isolation has died at the age of 80			1
@entity6 , a " colored " man of @entity9 - @entity8 heritage from @entity10 , was barred from playing first - class cricket in his home country			1
he caused a political storm when he was selected by his adopted nation @entity15 for the team 's 1968 - 69 tour of @entity2			1
having initially been left out of the squad after the @entity20 government exerted pressure , he was called up when a teammate was injured -- and the tour was subsequently canceled amid international outrage			1
@entity6 , a powerful batsman known as " @entity6 , " went on to play 44 tests for @entity15 , scoring 2,484 runs at an average of 40 and taking 47 wickets with his right - arm medium - pace bowling			1
he battled @entity30 in his later years , but passed away " peacefully " according to his son -- who like his father played for @entity34 and is now academy director at the county club			2
" it is a sad time for us as a family but , after a long battle against @entity30 , dad passed away peacefully , " @entity37 told the @entity39 's official website on saturday			1
" although it is difficult , we will celebrate a great life rather than mourn a death			0
" @entity49 chief executive @entity48 said @entity6 was an " inspiration			2
" " @entity6 was a true legend and a son of whom all @entity20 can be extremely proud , " @entity48 said			2

" having captained @entity2 's non-white cricket team and played for the national non-white football side , a frustrated @entity6 emigrated to @entity15 in 1960 at the age of 29 after writing to renowned cricket commentator @entity63 and asking for help			1
he was well past his prime as a player when he finally made his debut for @entity15 six years later			2
" one can only imagine what he might have achieved had he made his debut as he should have done at the age of 20 on @entity2 's tour of @entity15 in 1951 , " @entity48 said			1
" the circumstances surrounding his being prevented from touring the country of his birth with @entity15 in 1968 led directly to the intensification of opposition to apartheid around the world and contributed materially to the sports boycott that turned out to be an achilles heel of the apartheid government			1
" throughout this shameful period in @entity2 's sporting history , @entity6 displayed a human dignity that earned him worldwide respect and admiration			1
his memory and inspiration will live on among all of us			0
" @entity6 wrote about his arrival in @entity15 on his official website			1
" april 1st 1960 was probably one of the most astonishing days of my life			0

i was filled with misgivings and my inferiority complex was at a very low ebb , " he said			0
" i 'd left ( my wife ) @entity102 behind			0
in a few months i would be a father for the first time , and what kind of future could i guarantee @entity102 and my child ? however as i left with the assurance that the family and friends would take great care of her , an old aunt pulled me to one side and told me to aim high , there 's room for everyone up there -- a motto which has stayed with me always			0
" i am proud of my color , of what i 've achieved for myself and non-whites all over the world , and i dearly love my fellow citizens of @entity10			0
i often think back to those days in @entity2 , when i was trying to break out of the social and sporting straitjacket imposed by the color of my skin			2
" meanwhile , @entity2 ended the third day of the second test against @entity129 with a lead of 199 runs after @entity132 and @entity133 took the home side to 229 - 3 in their second innings in @entity137			2
