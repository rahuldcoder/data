-- @entity1 has launched a major redesign , simplifying many file management tasks and bringing a new video and photo viewer			1
the first thing you 'll notice in the new @entity8 is the action bar which lets you sort files by name , date , size and type			1
click on a file , and the action bar will get new options -- for example , you can download , delete , rename , move or copy a file from there			2
you can also perform these actions by right - clicking on a file , which makes @entity1 more similar to @entity24 's @entity23 than ever			2
@entity1 now also has a new video and photo viewer , which lets you view these types of content on your entire screen			1
photos and videos ( this includes @entity35 and @entity36 files ) now also have thumbnails , which makes them easier to preview			0
finally , new @entity1 supports drag - and - drop , simple multiple file selections , and keyboard shortcuts ( hit " ? " for a full list )			1
@entity1 search now also instantly pulls results as you type			0
according to @entity1 , this redesign is only the first step in a complete overhaul of the service , with more new stuff coming in the " next few months "			0
