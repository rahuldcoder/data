@entity0 , @entity1 -- if our nation wants to reduce global warming , air pollution and energy instability , we should invest only in the best energy options			2
nuclear energy is n't one of them			1
every dollar spent on nuclear is one less dollar spent on clean renewable energy and one more dollar spent on making the world a comparatively dirtier and a more dangerous place , because nuclear power and nuclear weapons go hand in hand			1
in the november issue of @entity26 , my colleague @entity22 of the @entity24 and i laid out a plan to power the world with nothing but wind , water and sun. after considering the best available technologies , we decided that a combination of wind , concentrated solar , geothermal , photovoltaics , tidal , wave and hydroelectric energy could more than meet all the planet 's energy needs , particularly if all the world 's vehicles could be run on electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cells			1
we rejected nuclear for several reasons			2
first , it 's not carbon - free , no matter what the advocates tell you			0
vast amounts of fossil fuels must be burned to mine , transport and enrich uranium and to build the nuclear plant			1
and all that dirty power will be released during the 10 to 19 years that it takes to plan and build a nuclear plant			1
( a wind farm typically takes two to five years			0
) @entity62 says now is the time for nuclear power the on - the - ground footprint of nuclear power , through its plants and uranium mines , is about 1,000 times larger than it is for wind			1
wind turbines are merely poles in the ground -- with lots of space between them that can be farmed , ranched or left open -- or poles in the ocean			0
geothermal energy also has a much smaller footprint than nuclear ; solar only slightly more			1
but while geothermal , solar and wind are safe , nuclear is not			2
for nuclear to meet all the world 's energy needs today -- 12.5 terawatts ( 1 terawatt = 1 trillion watts ) -- more than 17,000 nuclear plants would be needed			1
even if nuclear were only 5 percent of the solution , most countries would have nuclear plants			1
what 's worse , the nuclear industry wants to reprocess waste to obtain more energy from increasingly scarce uranium			1
but this only produces more weapons - grade uranium and plutonium			1
a global push toward nuclear energy would mean that uranium enrichment -- and efforts at nuclear weapons development -- would certainly grow throughout the world			1
. nuclear proponents argue that not enough clean renewables exist to power the world			2
however , part of our work at @entity110 has been to map world renewable energy resources			1
enough wind and solar exist in high - wind and sunny locations over land to power the world for all purposes multiple times over			2
nuclear proponents also argue that nuclear energy production is constant , unlike fickle winds and sunshine			2
but worldwide , nuclear plants are down 15 percent of the time , and when a plant goes down , so does a large fraction of the grid			1
connecting wind farms over large areas through transmission lines smoothes power supply			0
combining geothermal with wind ( whose power potential often peaks at night ) and solar ( which peaks by day ) , and using hydroelectricity to fill in gaps , would almost always match demand			0
converting to electric vehicles and using smart charging practices would also help to match supply with demand			0
so would storing energy ( with concentrated solar ) and giving people incentives to reduce demand			0
it is not rocket science to match power demand			0
it merely requires thinking out of the box			0
finally , the costs of land - based wind , geothermal and hydroelectricity are competitive with conventional new sources of electricity ; costs of solar and wind over the ocean are higher but declining			0
costs of nuclear have historically been underestimated			0
in sum , if we invest in nuclear versus true renewables , you can bet that the glaciers and polar ice caps will keep melting while we wait , and wait , for the nuclear age to arrive			0
we will also guarantee a riskier future for us all			0
there is no need for nuclear			0
the world can be powered by wind , water and sun alone			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

every dollar spent on nuclear power is one less spent on renewable energy , says @entity186
he says nuclear power plants take a very long time to build
he says mining , transport , enriching of uranium and building plants require fossil fuels
*widespread* nuclear plants raise risk of spreading nuclear weapons , he writes
