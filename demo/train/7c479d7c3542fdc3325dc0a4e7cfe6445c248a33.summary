remember the dark and brooding @entity0 , the one who wore one husband 's blood around her neck and shared an uncomfortably intense kiss with her brother ? that was n't about rebellion , @entity0 tells @entity8 in its june issue			1
that was a 20 - something trying to find herself			2
" it was n't a need to be destructive or rebellious -- it 's that need to find a full voice , to push open the walls around you , " the 38 - year - old actress says			1
" you want to be free			0
and as you start to feel that you are being corralled into a certain life , you kind of push against it			0
it may come out very strange , it may be interpreted wrong , but you 're trying to find out who you are			0
" interestingly , who she thought she 'd become and who she ended up being are two different things			0
now a mom of six and engaged to @entity29 , @entity0 says she once believed she would n't have kids or find love			1
" i never thought i 'd have children , i never thought i 'd be in love , i never thought i 'd meet the right person , " @entity0 says			1
" having come from a broken home -- you kind of accept that certain things feel like a fairy tale , and you just do n't look for them			0
" @entity0 and @entity29 's relationship dates back to 2005 , the same year their action thriller / romance movie " @entity40 " arrived in theaters			1
at the time , @entity29 petitioned to formally adopt @entity0 's two kids , @entity45 and @entity46 , and since then the couple have welcomed four more children : @entity49 , @entity50 and twins @entity51 and @entity52			1
" you get together and you 're two individuals and you feel inspired by each other , " @entity0 says of her relationship with @entity29			1
" ( @entity57 ) ou challenge each other , you complement each other , drive each other beautifully crazy			0
after all these years , we have history -- and when you have history with somebody , you 're friends in such a very real , deep way that there 's such a comfort , and an ease , and a deep love that comes from having been through quite a lot together			0
" lately @entity29 and @entity0 -- who announced their engagement in april 2012 -- are dealing with how to introduce their kids to show business			1
@entity51 co-stars with @entity0 in the may 30 release " @entity75 , " with @entity46 and @entity50 also making a brief appearance			2
the movie is a live - action re-telling of the " @entity81 " story from the wicked sorceress @entity75 's point of view , and @entity0 explained that @entity51 was cast as the young @entity84 because she was the only child who could withstand @entity0 's evil character			2
" my little @entity51 -- we call her my shadow , because there 's nothing i can do to shake her , " @entity0 tells @entity8			1
" i can be tired , i can be grumpy , i can be in a terrible mood , and she does n't care			0
it 's ' @entity92 , @entity92 , ' and she 'll cling to me			0
we knew that she would still do that thing , she 'd still smile at me and insist that i pick her up			0
so we could n't really cast anybody else			0
" ( and apparently @entity0 did try ; when she asked her daughter @entity49 " about being @entity84 , and she laughed in my face , " @entity0 recalls			2
" she said she 'd be a horned creature			0
" ) while @entity0 and @entity29 do n't discourage their kids from being involved in their careers , neither of them is eager to see the brood follow in their footsteps			1
" @entity29 and i made the decision that we would n't keep them from sets and the fun of making movies , but we would n't [ glorify it either ] -- we would n't make it a good thing or a bad thing , " @entity0 says			2
" but i would really prefer they do something else ... ( a ) fter two days of it , @entity29 and i were so stressed we never wanted to do it again			2
" @entity0 's emotional speech at @entity116 @entity118 's kids : then and now @entity29 : @entity0 is ' brave , bold ' and ' sexy as ever '			1
