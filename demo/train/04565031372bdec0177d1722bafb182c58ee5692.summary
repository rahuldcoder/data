@entity0 -- it was a tale of two rulings -- the best of times and the worst of times for @entity6 in the federal appeals courts			1
first , a three - judge panel of the @entity9 ruled tuesday against a key component of the law -- the federal subsidies for millions of people who signed up for health coverage			1
the 2 - 1 decision created a legal path for a possible @entity18 case that could essentially gut the @entity19 , which passed with zero @entity21 votes			2
a few hours later , all three judges on a 4th @entity9 panel in @entity24 decided the opposite by declaring the subsidies legal and proper			2
what the court decisions mean for you opposing rulings the opposing rulings increased the chances for the issue to reach the nation 's highest court , and demonstrated the deep political divisions over the law despised by conservatives intent on undermining it			1
both judges in the majority of the 2 - 1 @entity9 ruling were appointed by @entity21 presidents , while all three in the unanimous 4th @entity9 panel were appointed by @entity46 presidents			2
republicans immediately hailed the @entity9 panel 's ruling against the subsidies as evidence of what they called fatal flaws in the health care law			0
" this is yet more evidence that @entity6 is not working -- and can not work -- for the @entity62 people , " said @entity21 sen. @entity56 of @entity57 , who faces a conservative primary challenger questioning his right - wing credentials			2
at the @entity64 , spokesman @entity63 expressed confidence in the administration 's legal position , saying @entity68 clearly intended for all @entity62 to have access to tax credits if needed so they could afford health insurance			2
@entity1 poll : @entity74 's numbers not great but holding steady the issue : subsidies the legal argument involves a provision in the health care law that says people who obtained coverage through state - run exchanges can get federal subsidies such as tax credits			1
it does n't specifically say that those signing up on the federal exchange also are eligible			1
opponents of the law contend that lack of specificity renders illegal the subsidies for anyone who enrolled through the federal exchange			1
only 14 states and the @entity0 set up their own exchanges , meaning that the 4.7 million who signed up for subsidized health coverage through @entity99 could be affected			0
" it will kill @entity6 , " @entity100 sen. @entity100 of @entity101 said of an eventual @entity18 ruling against the subsidies			1
" it would make it very difficult for @entity6 to continue because the cost of health care is going to go sky high for those who are not in the state exchange			1
" for now , the law remains unchanged and the subsidized policies are unaffected until the legal case plays out , @entity63 told reporters			0
the @entity116 said the government would appeal the @entity9 panel 's decision			0
partisan divide the easiest fix -- changing the law to specify that it allows subsidies for coverage purchased through the federal government as well as state exchanges -- would mean reopening the debate in @entity68			1
unlike last time , when @entity46 held majorities in both the @entity64 and @entity129 , @entity21 now control the @entity64 and are expected to make gains in the november election , perhaps taking over the @entity129 too			0
that means @entity74 and @entity46 have no chance of getting @entity68 to approve any remedial change in the law			0
sen. @entity135 , @entity136 , one of the leading crusaders against the health care act , argued tuesday that the federal subsidies amounted to assuming funding powers the @entity141 granted @entity68			0
@entity63 , however , said @entity68 intended " to ensure that every eligible @entity62 who applied for tax credits to make their health insurance more affordable would have access to those tax credits , whether or not the marketplace was operated by federal officials or state officials			0
" @entity64 revises contraception opt out ambiguity the opposing rulings tuesday pivoted over the meaning of the word " ambiguous			0
" in @entity157 , the @entity156 judges labeled the @entity6 ambiguous on whether subsidies should be allowed for consumers getting insurance on federal exchanges			1
when a law is ambiguous , courts give deference to a federal agency 's interpretation of the law , which in this case is the @entity169 rule allowing the subsidies			0
the @entity9 decision concluded that @entity6 was unambiguous in restricting subsidies to insurance purchased on exchanges " established by the state , " rather than the federal exchange			1
in his dissent , though , appellate judge @entity177 -- a @entity46 appointee -- argued that labeling the phrase " established by the state " as unambiguous " strains fruitlessly to show plain meaning when there is none to be found			0
" republicans to sue @entity74 over health law obamacare : your guide to health insurance terms @entity192 's @entity191 and @entity1 's @entity193 and @entity194 contributed to this report , which was written by @entity196 .			0

new : one ruling goes against the government , another supports its position
the rulings *reignite* the fierce political debate over @entity6
for now , nothing changes until the cases *completes* the legal process
the issue would impact those who signed up for @entity6 on the federal exchange
