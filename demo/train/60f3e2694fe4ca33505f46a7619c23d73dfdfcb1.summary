-- ever since we saw him pop up on " @entity3 " last season , we 've been wondering : does @entity5 really have the cure for the show 's " walker virus " ? sunday night 's episode gave us a definitive answer to this burning question : @entity5 is a fraud ; he 's not a scientist and does n't actually know how to cure the plague			1
we spoke to @entity16 , who plays @entity5 , about his time on " @entity3 " and what might be next for the character ( that is , assuming he 's ok after being beaten up by @entity22 's @entity21 )			1
also , we talked mullets : @entity0 : were you surprised at the truth about @entity5 , or were you told ahead of time ? @entity16 : when i booked the role , i knew that @entity5 was n't a scientist , but i did n't know it was gon na come this season			1
when i sat down with ( executive producer ) @entity31 at the start of the season , we started to detail everything in vague terms about what 's gon na happen for the character and the season			1
he said , " in episode five , we 'll find out he 's not a scientist			1
" i was like , wow , i did n't expect it to come that quick			0
i thought it would play out over the season			0
for it to happen that quickly , it will be fun to see where @entity5 heads next -- if he 's alive ! @entity0 : what do you think of @entity5 's true motivation ? @entity16 : i think we 'd all be scared in this apocalypse			1
some people have the strength and agility to rise to the top , and then there 's people like @entity5 who have to improvise and figure out a different way to survive			1
@entity21 says it 's to the point where everyone still alive is really strong , and either they help you or you kill them			2
@entity5 looks at himself as not having anything to offer to the group			1
it 's a scary place			2
i will defend the guy in terms of wanting to survive			0
i do n't know if i would lie like that , but i 'm just happy i did n't get @entity72 killed or anything -- then everyone would hate @entity5 for sure			2
now they 're just upset the hope is gone			0
@entity0 : what can you tell us about his current relationship with @entity21 after this huge fight ? @entity16 : it 's not just that , it 's the relationship he has with @entity85 and @entity86			1
he and @entity86 feel like outsiders , and she 's trying to work her way back into the group			2
i think that 's where @entity5 will want to go : " how do i get back into this group ? how do i patch up the damage i 've done and figure out where my place is in this group ? " there 's a little bit of hope for @entity5 , but at this point he 's a broken man , starting over			1
@entity0 : how much did you know about " @entity3 " going in ? @entity16 : i knew the comic but had n't read it			1
once i found out who it was i was playing , i went back and quickly caught up			0
it was very informative to see the choices ( creator @entity109 ) @entity108 made that they did n't necessarily go with ( on ) the show			0
i was able to bring some of that from the comics into the character and that brings something to what we 're doing			2
i had to put it down for a while , because i was afraid i would influence it too much			0
i was a giant fan of the show and did n't want to be the one that ruined it			0
( laughs ) @entity0 : so we have to ask : how do you like having a mullet ? @entity16 : in the audition they 're very secretive ; they wo n't tell you the character name			1
the character they had me reading had a mohawk			2
i got so excited that i might have a mohawk			0
then when i found out it was a mullet , i was like this is the only haircut i could get better			0
to be able to go on tv and be instantly recognizable as this guy representing so many lost souls in our country			0
i do n't think we 've had a good mullet on tv since @entity148 from " @entity149 , " so i 'm glad to bring it back			0
@entity0 : what is next for @entity21 's army ? @entity16 : at this moment , they 're still together			1
we 're not gon na flash - forward six months or anything			0
we 'll see how the damage is repaired , and it 's not pretty , i 'll tell you that .			0
