-- it did n't take long for everyone involved in the @entity4 story to start squabbling			1
@entity4 -- whose song " friday " hit number 38 on @entity8 's digital singles chart this week -- and her mother , @entity9 , are accusing @entity10 , which produced " friday , " of copyright infringement and unlawful exploitation of publicity rights			1
a march 29 letter from @entity4 and @entity16 's lawyer @entity15 to @entity10 obtained by @entity0 alleges that @entity17 has failed to provide @entity4 with the master recordings of her song and video ; has been exploiting her likeness and her song on @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity17 's website ; created an unauthorized " friday " ringtone ; and has been advertising @entity4 as an exclusive @entity17 recording artist on its website			1
@entity31 : why @entity4 is a @entity32 in an interview with @entity0 , @entity10 founder @entity33 denied most of the allegations in the letter			1
" i have met with @entity4 's mom and everything is fine , " he said			1
" she will get the masters and the song			2
they can have it all			0
" @entity16 paid @entity17 $ 4,000 ( not $ 2,000 , as has been widely reported ) to produce the song , and according to @entity15 's letter , the agreement that she signed with @entity17 in november stipulates that @entity4 has 100 percent ownership and control of " friday , " including the master recording and the music video			1
@entity4 shot the video for " friday " in january , and the ark team finished it a few weeks later			1
it was uploaded to @entity23 on february 10 , but it only had around 4,000 views until it was posted on comedian @entity55 's " @entity56 " @entity54 blog on march 11 , and comedian @entity57 tweeted about it			0
overnight , it had gotten over 200,000 views , and by march 15 , it had over 5 million views on @entity23			0
and after her " @entity64 " appearance on march 18 , she had evolved from a meme to a celebrity			0
what you need to @entity69 @entity4 " she 's not our exclusive artist , " said @entity33			1
" once an artist meets with us and once they blow up , they have a choice to retain us or move on if they can			0
@entity4 is now signed with someone else			1
" @entity33 added that he will remove @entity4 from the @entity10 website			1
but @entity17 's lawyer , @entity79 , cast doubt on the validity of the november agreement			1
" the agreement was not court - approved , " @entity79 said			0
" they say they own the composition			0
nothing could be further from the truth			0
if they go forward and license it or attempt to copyright it in their name , that would be copyright infringement and we 'd act accordingly under the circumstances			0
" he added : " we 're not prepared to engage them in producing documents just because they want them , without a court order or litigation			0
we 'd like to see @entity4 's career go forward and we 're trying to accomplish that in the context of working through the legalities			1
" @entity33 's @entity10 partner @entity109 contended that @entity17 did act as a record label for @entity4 , and distributed and promoted her with her mother 's consent -- until it became clear that @entity4 was going to make actual money			1
" now they are turning it around and saying they were exploited , but clearly that is not the case when they were thanking me for forwarding them all the interviews with @entity4 and all the positive comments from @entity23 , " said @entity109			2
" i was calling @entity125 on my cell phone pretending to be @entity4 's agent and setting up radio interviews for @entity4 while @entity9 was right next to me			2
if she thought i was exploiting this , she could have said it			0
" why @entity4 's @entity131 ' friday ' is actually good " @entity9 's trying to get the rights to things she does n't have the rights to , " said ark creative director @entity132			1
neither @entity16 nor @entity15 returned calls for comment			2
@entity4 is the first real success to come out of the @entity139 - based @entity17 , whose website was registered in august 2010 by @entity33			1
@entity17 's biggest successes other than @entity4 are the singer @entity143 's " butterflies , " which has close to 6 million @entity23 views , and @entity146 's " @entity145 , " which has 1.7 million @entity23 views			1
" suddenly , everyone is seeing big dollars and everyone is getting greedy and it sucks , " said @entity109 , who claims that his team wrote the music and lyrics to " friday			0
" " my team just needs to be looked after to some extent			0
they need to be compensated for something			0
" he argued that @entity4 should own the master recording for her vocals , but that @entity17 should have copyright for the song and composition			1
" we gave @entity4 10 percent of the publishing , but she did n't even write a lyric			2
" @entity64 " came over , i paid $ 400 for the make up artist and no one even thanked me for that			2
" and now it seems as though @entity17 's success may be its undoing			2
@entity33 recently hired his own lawyer , and @entity109 alleges that @entity33 wo n't give him access to the website			0
" yesterday we were supposed to have a meeting at my attorney 's place			0
i did n't hear from him all day			0
he sent me a text message late at night saying , ' sorry , brother , i 've had a busy day			0
' in the meantime he 's going around saying i 'm not with @entity17 " copyright Â© 2011 @entity0 .			2
