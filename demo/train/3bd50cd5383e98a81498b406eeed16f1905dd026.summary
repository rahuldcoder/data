-- @entity1 had his four - year - old son , @entity2 , join him in a scene that simulated the real destruction he had narrowly escaped in @entity5 , @entity6			0
in 2004 , a monstrous black wave of rubble surged towards @entity1 as he ran for his life			0
in october , the trauma of that day was relived as he took part in a drill to test the area 's new tsunami early warning system			1
five years ago , @entity1 had no shelter to run to as giant waves crashed onto @entity6 's west coast , but things have changed since the tsunami left some 245,000 dead or missing in 14 countries across the @entity22 region			1
early warning sirens drone , and there are shelters that can hold hundreds of people			1
twenty nations took part in the october tsunami drill			2
the @entity22 region now has new deep - water buoys -- or tsunami sensors , sirens , tide gauges and a web of communications systems to help forewarn a future catastrophe			1
but experts said the new instruments and drills are not enough			1
educating communities about how to react to signs of a threat like a tsunami -- with or without an official warning -- is what they see as a key challenge			1
" technology will improve ... the question is how we go to the last mile , " said @entity47 , a professor of civil engineering at the @entity49			0
did you survive the tsunami ? did you lose a loved one ? share your thoughts on the 5th anniversary on @entity58 situated in a high - risk zone , @entity6 now has developed the capability to warn of the potential for a tsunami from an undersea earthquake within five minutes of its occurrence			2
by next year , the country aims to take its warning system to the next level by calculating the height and the arrival of a tsunami , said the director of @entity6 's earthquake and tsunami center , @entity75 , who like many @entity6 uses only one name			1
in 2007 , @entity78 put into place an early warning system that officials say is equipped with state - of - the - art facilities and connected with international networks			2
more than 34,000 people in @entity78 died or went missing in the 2004 disaster , according to the @entity86 ( @entity86 )			2
@entity87 , the @entity86 's disaster - reduction adviser in @entity89 , said the warning system would help reduce the number of deaths from a similar situation in the future			1
yet , the country needs to upgrade networks to reach all communities , she said			0
" we still have a long way to go , " @entity87 said			0
" it 's all about how you reach the remotest villages along the coast			0
" the rarity of tsunamis , which she described as a once - in - a - 50 - year event , makes the task of spreading awareness about them more difficult			0
" you may have a very sophisticated system but the real test is how that ultimately leads to timely evacuation and actionable information , " @entity87 said			2
nonetheless , she praised @entity78 's evacuation exercises during last year 's massive flooding in its @entity120 state			0
@entity121 , program coordinator for the @entity86 's regional center in @entity123 , rates the @entity22 early tsunami warning systems as superior to those of the @entity126 in terms of earthquake monitoring and detection			1
@entity130 , @entity131 and some east @entity133 nations , however , have lagged behind @entity78 , @entity6 , @entity134 and the @entity135 in their investments in public education , @entity121 said			0
but in terms of the number of tidal buoys , the @entity126 system was far ahead , he said			1
@entity143 , a chief scientist with the @entity144 in @entity145 , said @entity22 countries have made significant progress in tsunami preparedness			1
but while systems have improved , he , like others , stressed the importance of educating individuals			0
" you have to have an end - to - end system , " @entity143 said			0
" get it in school curriculum			0

five years ago : *limited* tsunami *infrastructure*
today : tsunami sensors , tide gauges , shelters , drills
experts : @entity166 is educating people about what to do
in terms of number of tidal buoys , @entity126 system is far ahead of @entity22
