@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 secretary of state @entity4 on thursday warned participants in the climate change conference in @entity0 that they are " running out of time " to reach an agreement on what to do about global warming			1
critics say those attending the @entity14 , which began december 7 , have made little or no headway toward developing a plan			1
@entity3 officials in @entity0 and at the @entity18 confirmed that talks broke down wednesday after the @entity20 rejected @entity3 demands that they commit to transparency regarding their emissions reductions			1
without mentioning @entity20 by name , @entity24 said their continued refusal would be " kind of a deal breaker for us			2
" the uncertainty over whether a deal could be reached before talks end friday led to speculation that president @entity33 might not travel to @entity0 as planned , but @entity18 spokesman @entity34 told reporters he would leave thursday evening			1
" we all know there are real challenges that remain in the hours left to these negotiations , " @entity24 said			2
" and it is no secret that we have lost precious time in these past days			0
in the time we have left here , it can no longer be about us versus them			0
" we all face the same challenge together , " she added			0
" we 're running out of time			0
it 's unfortunate that there have been problems with the process , difficulties with certain parties being willing to come to the table , all kinds of discussions and disagreements , sometimes about the past rather than about the future			0
" without mentioning @entity20 by name , @entity24 said that nation 's continued refusal to come to the table would be " kind of a deal breaker for us			0
" @entity34 said the @entity20 " balked " at the " strong transparency requirement , " and he " hoped they would reconsider			0
" " the president is going to travel in hopes of making progress for a strong operational agreement , " @entity34 said			2
" there are no changes in the president 's plans			2
" the agreement @entity33 is hoping for out of @entity0 would not be a treaty , nor would it be legally binding			1
@entity34 acknowledged it would be " a political agreement that would lead to a treaty " later			0
the last time the president traveled to @entity0 -- in october to try to win the 2012 @entity81 bid for @entity82 -- he came back empty - handed			1
" coming back with an empty agreement would far worse , " @entity34 said thursday			0
@entity24 said the @entity3 is concerned about the ability of needy nations to do their part			1
the @entity3 is willing to work with other countries to raise $ 100 billion by 2020 to address the climate - change needs of developing nations , she said			1
she told delegates that the @entity3 already has joined an effort to provide more immediate funding that would reach $ 10 billion in 2012			1
" after a year of diplomacy , we have come to @entity0 ready to take the steps necessary to achieve a comprehensive and operational new agreement that will provide a foundation for long - term , sustainable economic growth , " @entity24 said			2
" we have now reached the critical juncture in these negotiations			0
i understand that the talks have been difficult			2
i know that our team , along with many others , are working hard and around the clock to forge a deal , " she said			0
" but the time is at hand for all countries to reach for common ground and take an historic step that we can all be proud of			0
" @entity24 's announcement was " enormously encouraging , " @entity116 , an internationally known zoologist , conservationist and explorer , said on @entity2 's " @entity120			0
" @entity24 proposed several core elements that should be included in any plan : decisive national actions ; an operational accord " that internationalizes those actions " ; technical and other assistance for needy nations that are " the most vulnerable and least prepared to meet the effects of climate change ; and standards of transparency that provide credibility to the entire process			1
" " the world community should accept no less , " she added			0
@entity137 , director - general of the @entity138 , said on " @entity139 " he is optimistic that leaders can strike a deal before the conference ends			2
" compared to yesterday , what we have now is that the negotiators have hunkered down , " he said			0
" they 're actually in drafting committees			0
" if the @entity3 can commit to another couple of percent in terms of cuts ( in emissions ) , if the @entity20 can increase their efficiency gains by 5 percent , that 'll probably be enough to bring the @entity155 on board for a 30 percent target , and then we 'll be there			1
" meanwhile , @entity161 prime minister @entity160 , who suggested the initial estimate of about $ 100 billion a year by 2020 to reduce emissions , urged leaders thursday to reach an agreement that would limit " long - term , global temperature increases " to no more than 2 degrees			1
according to the 10 @entity168 web site , @entity160 told the conference that wealthier countries must commit to provide immediate funding for developing countries to reach such a goal			1
he recommended that financing start in january , with nations providing $ 10 billion a year by 2012			1
he called on developing countries to commit to ambitious mitigation actions to handle climate change			1
" to the developed world i say : environmental action is the most powerful engine of job creation in an economy urgently in need of millions of new jobs			0
" to the developing world i say : the technology now exists to gain the dividends of a high - growth economy without incurring the damage of a high - carbon economy			1
" and to all nations i say : it is not enough for us to do the least we can get away with when history asks that we demand the most of ourselves			2
