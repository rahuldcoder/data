-- @entity1 , a 14 - year - old @entity2 citizen , has been separated from her mother for nearly two years			1
her mom was deported to @entity5 for being in the @entity2 illegally			2
@entity1 is one of an estimated 4 million " citizen children " in the @entity2 , according to new study			1
at the age of 12 , @entity1 was forced to decide between her country and her family			0
with the help of a @entity13 philanthropist , she chose to stay in the @entity2			2
" it 's really , really hard to leave your family , " she told @entity0 by phone			1
a study issued tuesday provides one of the most comprehensive looks at " citizen children " like @entity1 who are caught in the cross hairs of the nation 's illegal immigration battle			1
nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the @entity2 illegally were born in the @entity2 and are @entity2 citizens as a result , according to the study conducted by the @entity31			1
that 's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the @entity2 , according to the study			1
about 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants live in poverty , the study found			1
" among children whose parents are unauthorized immigrants , one in three is poor			2
the [ poverty ] rate of children of unauthorized immigrants is similar whether the children are unauthorized immigrants or @entity2 born , " the study says			1
roughly 12 million illegal immigrants are in the @entity2 -- about 4 percent of the nation 's population			1
the study found that the majority of illegal immigrants , about 7 million , come from @entity5			1
@entity57 with the @entity58 - based advocacy organization @entity56 said the study underscores how the nation 's immigration situation is " not so simple			2
" " this really highlights the fact that so many undocumented families are of mixed status -- that there is a @entity2 citizen in the direct family , " he said			2
undocumented immigrants make up more than 5 percent of the @entity2 work force , according to the study , based on march 2008 figures from the @entity74			1
the children of illegal immigrants make up an even greater share of students in @entity2 's primary and secondary schools , with nearly 7 percent enrolled in kindergarten through 12th grade			1
that figure has jumped , from 5.4 percent in 2003			0
in states near @entity5 's border -- @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 -- about 10 percent of the student population are the children of illegal immigrants			1
the study also found that these children are more likely to live in a two - parent home , compared with the rest of the nation			1
" the vast majority of all children with at least one unauthorized immigrant parent live in two - parent families ( 80 percent ) , " the study says			1
" this is similar to the share of children of other immigrants who do so ( 84 percent ) and higher than the share of children with @entity2 - born parents ( 71 percent )			1
" the study comes as the @entity112 administration considers comprehensive immigration reform			0
@entity112 has supported a combination of enforcing laws and opening up the system			0
he wants to see a pass for citizenship that would mean having an illegal immigrant pay a fine , learn @entity121 and then get in line for citizenship			1
critics refer to that " path to citizenship " as amnesty			0
in the case of @entity1 , she was born in @entity130 , lived there her entire life and went to school there			0
but her mother , @entity133 , entered the @entity2 illegally before @entity1 was born and @entity2 immigration officials deported her in 2007			2
two of her brothers were also deported			0
her 7 - year - old sister , who is a @entity2 citizen , is living in @entity5 with her mother			2
" she is getting no education or very little -- and pretty much has lost all of her @entity121 language skills for being out of the country now for almost two years			0
it 's just awful , " said @entity143 , the philanthropist who came to @entity1 's aid			0
@entity143 formed a group called @entity147 to help citizen children , which works with churches along the @entity2 - @entity5 border to provide support for children whose mother or father is deported to @entity5			1
@entity1 has been living with his family over the last year in @entity89			0
he has urged @entity112 to issue an executive order to stay the deportation of any undocumented parent of a citizen child to prevent the separation of families			2
" it 's the only humane thing to do , " he said			0
immigration officials have long maintained they are simply enforcing the laws on the books and it 's the fault of the parents for putting children into such a predicament by not following proper immigration channels			2
@entity1 , who first told her story to @entity0 last year , said she speaks to her mom nearly every day by phone and communicates with her via e-mail			0
" i miss them a lot , " she said			0
" i mean big time ! " she last visited her family in @entity179 at @entity180			0
she said she hopes to be a lawyer for immigrants one day " to help make their dreams come true , to make a better life here			0
" her message to citizen children : " stay strong			0
if they separate you from your family , you can still try to be together			0
" she added with a sigh , " it 's not right what they 're doing -- separating families			0
