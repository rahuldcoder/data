-- the @entity1 is currently the setting of a new form of airspace race			2
as the economies grow in a handful of countries in the region , so too do ambitions -- and few things symbolize a country 's aspirations as aptly as an airport			1
it 's no wonder , then , that @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 are each vying to throw up the biggest and grandest transportation hub in the region			1
" @entity1 likes to use words like ' iconic ' and ' world class , ' " says @entity21 , a managing principal at @entity22 , the architecture firm in charge of the @entity25 design			1
the total airport expansion for @entity15 , which is slated for completion in 2017 , will clock in at $ 6.8 billion ( @entity33 's $ 1.4 billion @entity32 upgrade pales in comparison )			1
though this sounds like a hefty sum , @entity21 notes that per - square foot , it 's pretty reasonable			2
it just happens that the new complex will take up seven million square feet -- just a little larger than the @entity42			1
it will also alter the @entity15 skyline			1
" it might be the tallest terminal building in the world , " he notes			2
the new airports are already battling for superlatives			2
@entity17 's impending @entity51 will house the world 's second longest runway , while @entity18 and @entity16 are competing for the title of world 's largest airport			1
fittingly , all are implementing state - of - the - art facilities -- be it specially designed runways or tiered bridges -- to accommodate the @entity62 -- the world 's largest passenger aircraft			1
read more : @entity65 goes inside the @entity62 to a degree , these looming hubs are also meant to be a showcase for the city beyond the passport controls			2
retail , five - star hotels and landscaping are as much a part of the designs as customs and security features			0
the @entity15 terminal , for instance , will also house a museum to pique interest in the city 's impending @entity83 and @entity84 additions			1
" a number of passengers may not make it to @entity15 , because they 're only connecting			1
the plan is to use the airport to introduce them so they can come back on subsequent visits , " says @entity21			2
perhaps more telling than the various design features are the airports ' planned capacities ; combined , they will ultimately accommodate 450 million passengers a year -- a significant jump from the 140 million that currently make their way through the region			1
" when you add the numbers together , it feels over the top			0
it seems it will be quite difficult for them to reach their aspirations when you view them in a cluster , " says @entity105 , partner and managing director of the @entity107			0
still , @entity113 expresses doubts that any of the proposed airports will flounder			0
" maybe they wo n't fill capacity in the next five years , but i do n't think any of the airports will collapse			1
the whole region has adopted an ' if - you - build - it - they - will - come ' strategy			2
when you 're advanced structurally , that strategy can work			0
" the airports are part of a wider expansion scheme across the region			2
increased airport activity also means increased landing fees and duty - free revenues			0
in @entity16 , aviation already accounts for 28 % of the city 's gdp -- a figure that 's expected to grow to 35 % once the new airport is fully operational			1
" this is a country that sees the value of aviation and embraces it , " says @entity136 , head of corporate communications at @entity139			0
read more : inside @entity16 's @entity143 since its inception , @entity144 has seen its passenger numbers grow an average of 15 % per year ( roughly three times the global average )			1
this year , it surpassed @entity150 in terms of international passenger traffic , making it the second busiest airport in the world			1
as a result , @entity136 is not worried they 're overreaching with their plans			0
" we 're not overextended ... yet			0
while it 's not an issue now , it could become an issue in the 2020s when we max out our capacity , which is 74 million			1
by the end of the year , we should reach 66 million , " says @entity136			0
while @entity105 thinks some of the airports might have to " adjust their aspirations , " he thinks each holds its own advantage			0
in particular , he predicts tremendous growth for the projected @entity172 , which is aiming for a yearly capacity of 150 million			2
they are capturing a market share from @entity177 carriers , and compared to the @entity179 countries , they have a strong domestic market			0
will they hit the exact numbers they talk about ? who knows ? but they are quite strong , and i have no doubt this will continue into the foreseeable future , " he says			0
of greater concern , perhaps , is the limited amount of airspace available when all airports are up and running			0
@entity136 admits that there wo n't be room for two @entity16 airports			1
" you probably could n't operate two airports of that size at full capacity so close to each other because of air traffic			1
airspace is a finite thing , " he says			0
what will ultimately happen to @entity144 , though , remains to be seen			0
" we do n't have a firm answer on that right now , " @entity136 admits			0
" right now , the master plan is being looked at and fine tuned			0

@entity16 , @entity15 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 are all upgrading their main transport hubs .
there is pressure in the region to build the most ' iconic ' airport .
the combined capacity in the region will number 450 million -- three times current traffic .
@entity18 and @entity16 are both claiming their airports will be the world 's biggest .
