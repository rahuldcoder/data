-- @entity1 was in the air on sunday for @entity3 and @entity4			1
business travelers and frequent fliers on @entity7 , the couple from @entity9 , @entity10 , decided there was no place they 'd rather marry than while flying			2
and why not land at the airport known for love -- @entity15 -- after the happy occasion ? that 's why they approached @entity7 with their idea of being married in the air			2
after all , it 's famous for its fun , including flight attendants who entertain , wedding proposals and even rewarding flight attendants who are especially good to customers ( after a customer praised one flight attendant on @entity34 midflight , the airline publicly honored her with a giant cookie )			1
but this was the @entity7 's first wedding where the airline joined the wedding planning team from departure gate to arrival gate			2
( follow the fun using @entity7 's hashtag # nonstoplove			0
) with a band playing and balloons decorating the jetway , the happy couple and about 30 friends and family boarded @entity49 in @entity50 for the ceremony			0
about 100 unsuspecting fellow passengers received an extra boarding pass inviting them to celebrate			1
a flower girl walking down the aisle handed out peanuts to start the ceremony , followed by an officiant using the loudspeaker to perform the marriage of @entity3 and @entity4			1
there were modifications for the unique location : " if anyone can show just cause why they might not be lawfully joined together , let them push their flight attendant call button now or forever hold your peace			1
" the airline had a reason for highlighting this particular route : the wedding took place on @entity7 's first nonstop flight from @entity50 to @entity15			1
the airline had been prevented from offering that particular route under the @entity77 , which @entity78 passed in 1979 to allow only flights from @entity15 to neighboring states ( with a few exceptions )			0
@entity78 repealed the law in 2006 , and it expired in october			0
the @entity83 were heading to their honeymoon in @entity85 on monday morning , a gift of the airline			0
@entity85 is another relatively new destination for @entity7 , which moved into the international market after its 2010 purchase of @entity91 ( and its international routes )			0
lasting connections : love at the airport			0

@entity3 and @entity4 say " i do " in the air
about 100 unsuspecting fliers attended the wedding
anyone *objecting* to the wedding could press their flight attendant call button
