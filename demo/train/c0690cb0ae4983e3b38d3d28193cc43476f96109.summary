@entity0 -- how much do @entity2 fear @entity3 as the likely @entity5 presidential nominee in 2016 ? so much that @entity6 has her in his sights			1
the conservative political mastermind credited with orchestrating @entity10 's two winning presidential campaigns insinuated in a fact - challenged attack last week that @entity13 was brain damaged			1
condemnation from @entity5 and some @entity2 came quickly , but @entity6 achieved his goal of inserting the question of @entity13 's health into the national discussion before she has declared if she will run in an election more than two years away			1
on wednesday , former president @entity13 came to his wife 's defense , joking during a public appearance that if @entity3 had brain damage , " then i must be in really tough shape because she 's still quicker than i am			1
" " it 's just the beginning " " it 's just the beginning , " he said of @entity6 's attack , adding that @entity2 " will still get better at it			1
" when it comes to playing a political card , few deal better than @entity6 , who specializes in undermining the perceived strengths of opposing candidates			2
recall the 2004 " swift - boating " of @entity39 , who saw one of his biggest potential advantages -- his military service in @entity43 compared to @entity10 's non-participation -- turned into a liability by questions about what he did there			2
now @entity6 takes on a former @entity50 senator and secretary of state who is the overwhelming favorite for the @entity5 nomination , if she decides to run			2
@entity13 also polls strongly against all the known potential @entity2 contenders , a situation that likely prompted @entity6 to go after her			1
in comments at a may 8 conference reported by the @entity62 's @entity61 gossip column , @entity6 said @entity13 spent 30 days in the hospital in 2012 and wore " glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury " when she returned to public life			1
both assertions were false -- she spent a few days in the hospital and the glasses help deal with double vision rather than traumatic brain damage			0
nevertheless , the comments generated headlines and political chatter , including repeated discussions on @entity1 programs			0
echo chamber @entity81 , a spokesman for @entity13 , said @entity6 lied about @entity13 's health but " he does n't care , because all he wants to do is inject the issue into the echo chamber , and he 's succeeding			1
" " it 's flagrant and thinly veiled , " @entity81 said , adding that @entity2 " are scared of what she has achieved and what she has to offer			2
" as for @entity13 , he said " she is 100 % , period			0
" even former house speaker @entity94 , a @entity2 political adversary of the @entity95 in the 1990s , blasted @entity6 's comments as typical of what he called a @entity2 consulting class that " wants to be negative , narrow , personal , avoid ideas and not have to wrestle with the big issue			1
" @entity6 's tactic not only drew attention , it linked the controversy he started to the dominant @entity2 attack line against @entity13 so far -- her management of the september 11 , 2012 , attack on a @entity50 diplomatic compound in @entity108 , @entity109 , that killed ambassador @entity110 and three other @entity50			1
@entity111 @entity2 have formed a select committee on @entity108 , a step intended to keep the issue in the public eye , while democrats oppose the move and have yet to decide if they will take part			1
@entity108 link two months after the @entity108 terror attack , @entity13 suffered a blood clot following a fall			1
she underwent testing in a hospital , then later was admitted for a three - day stay			0
the health issue prevented her from testifying to @entity127 about the attack , and some @entity2 questioned the validity of her health problem at the time			1
@entity6 brought up all that history on tuesday when he backed away from his factual errors but stressed the overall issue of @entity13 's health			1
" i did n't say she had brain damage			0
she had a serious health episode , " @entity6 told @entity137 before reciting a chronology of what happened in december 2012 and january 2013			2
" first she had apparently a serious virus , " he said			0
" they announced then on the 15th of december that she had at some period in the past week fallen			0
they did n't say when , they did n't say where			0
she was recovering at home			0
" later in december , @entity6 continued , " she goes in and turns out to have had a blood clot " but " they wo n't say where			0
" " the next day , they say it is between her skull and her brain behind her right ear , " he noted			0
when she testified before @entity127 on @entity108 on january 25 , @entity13 wore " special glasses that allow her to deal with the double vision that this episode caused , " @entity6 added			1
in response , @entity13 ridiculed @entity2 efforts to politicize the entire @entity108 issue			1
" first they say she faked her concussion , " he noted wednesday , and now they have her " auditioning for a part on the @entity169			0
" if elected in 2016 , @entity13 would be 69 when she becomes president -- the same age as @entity177 when he moved into the @entity111 in january 1981			2
age a campaign issue ? @entity2 commentators repeatedly made that point wednesday , saying @entity5 defending @entity13 had questioned the age of @entity2 such as @entity177 , vice president @entity183 and sen. @entity184 when they ran for higher office			2
@entity2 strategist @entity186 called @entity6 's " erroneous " remarks an acknowledgment of reality rather than a strategic ploy			2
" i think it was a very awkward attempt at making a pretty obvious point , which is that non-candidates , which @entity3 technically is , they do n't get a level of scrutiny that official candidates in a 2016 race might get , " said @entity186 , a @entity1 contributor			0
" it 's the @entity204 of the internet age where you can put anything out there , make a big lie , make this thing up about 30 days in the hospital , which was patently not true , make this thing up about sunglasses , " said @entity202 , a former adviser to @entity13			2
" it was totally fabricated			0
then he pulls it back			0
now we 're having this whole segment on it			0
" @entity219 , a senior adviser for @entity220 , one of the super pacs formed to back a @entity13 candidacy , said @entity6 's tactic would backfire on @entity2 because it boosted support for @entity13			1
@entity186 responded that vilifying @entity6 amounted to a @entity5 counter-strategy			0
" the reason that we 're talking about this today has less to do with whether or not some of the facts related to @entity3 's health , " he said			1
" it has to do with the fact that now while @entity3 is not an official candidate , her organization and her supporters , they 're acting like one			0
they seized on this as an opportunity to drive a contrast with someone like @entity6 , to express some outrage and maybe engender some sympathy for @entity3			2
" @entity1 's @entity243 contributed to this report .			0
