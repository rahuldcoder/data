editor 's note : this story is part of a series highlighting superlatives of countries around the world			2
click here for pieces on @entity11 , the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , and watch for upcoming installments featuring other countries			0
with 23 million people crammed onto an island that covers just more than 36,000 square kilometers , @entity17 ranks among the 20 most densely populated places in the world			1
although the industrious island has built a global reputation for cheap electronics , this is one @entity27 tiger that offers far more than stickers on the backs of calculators			0
economically there 's little it has left to prove , but @entity17 people remain a proud and determined bunch			1
here are 10 things they do better than anyone else			0
night markets for an island smaller in area than @entity42 , @entity17 sure has a lot of night markets -- an estimated 300 island - wide			1
these open - air bazaars are particularly loved for street food , referred to locally as xiao - chi , literally " small eats			0
" perennial favorites are oyster omelets , stinky tofu and an assortment of snacks on a stick straight off the grill			0
specialty drinks range from bubble tea to shots of snake blood			0
according to the @entity61 , some 70 % of tourists to @entity17 will visit a night market			1
the top three @entity64 check - ins for 2013 in @entity17 were all night markets ; @entity66 ( 12th globally ) nabbed the top spot , followed by @entity68 and @entity69 night markets in @entity71 and @entity72 , respectively			1
themed restaurants if literal toilet humor ( eating out of miniature urinals and toilet bowls ) is your idea of an amuse bouche , @entity17 provides a belly full of laughs			1
modern toilet restaurants address taboos pertaining to dining etiquette , posing witty rhetoric on websites such as : " to eat or to pee ? now that is the question			0
" at the other extreme , you can get a cutesy overdose at a @entity91 namesake cafe , where everything from burger buns to soup bowls is shaped like the mouthless cartoon cat			0
( for more on the kitty obsession , read point 9 below			0
) what 's that ? ca n't get enough pink and glitter ? that 's ok , because @entity17 is home to the world 's first @entity104 - themed restaurant , with @entity107 - approved smotherings of pink plastic and frilly tutus			1
previous themed restaurants in @entity17 have included a cafe based on an @entity112 , complete with trolly dollies serving food and drinks from a cart , as well as restaurants with jail , hospital and school - inspired themes			1
free @entity121 since 2011 , @entity17 citizens have been able to log onto @entity123 , the island 's free @entity121 network			1
@entity17 is one of the first places in the world to offer free @entity121 on a mass scale			1
in june 2013 , the service was rolled out to tourists in four of the five largest cities , using more than 4,400 hotspots			1
visitors can sign up for an @entity123 account with their passport at @entity61 centers and offices in transportation stations , then receive complimentary @entity121 in @entity140 , @entity140 , @entity72 and @entity141			1
more : @entity17 offers free @entity121 to all foreign tourists 4			1
@entity144 artifacts you might think it 'd be in @entity147 or @entity148 , but the @entity149 in @entity140 houses the largest collection of @entity144 artifacts and artwork in the world			1
the impressive permanent collection comprises more than 650,000 items			1
@entity144 history is told through bronze statues , jade carvings , calligraphy , lacquerware and other historical pieces -- many of which belonged to @entity144 imperial families -- including an intriguingly life - like , meat - shaped stone and a jadeite cabbage			1
despite several rounds of building expansion , only a fraction of the collection is on display ( no more than 10,000 items at any one time ) , making the museum worth returning to several times a year			2
animated news with an army of about 400 animators , @entity178 ( @entity178 ) , a @entity17 - based animation studio , can turn any news story into a cartoon in as fast as 90 minutes ( ' making - of ' video here )			2
more impressively -- the videos are usually satirical , outrageous and hilarious			2
the studio , created by a @entity187 media tycoon , takes infotainment to another level			0
founded in 2007 to create @entity193 - animated videos for news without real footage for @entity197 @entity196 in @entity187 and @entity17 , the talents of @entity17 's animators were exposed to the world with the 2009 release of their hilarious video of what might have happened during @entity204 ' infamous car crash			1
in the video , now ex-wife @entity205 chases @entity204 ' car with a golf club after finding out about @entity204 ' affair			0
after the video went viral , the company decided to service international audiences in @entity213 and @entity214			0
some of the team 's most popular recent works include a video about the execution of @entity220 's uncle and a review of five stories that must die in 2014			0
mock meat one of the world 's most vegetarian - friendly destinations , @entity17 offers 6,000 or so restaurants serving an impressive variety of delicious vegetarian fare to feed the 10 % of the country that shuns meat			1
but while it ca n't beat @entity231 in terms of the abundance and variety of vegetarian dishes on offer , @entity17 is the best place to hit when you 're craving meat but do n't actually want to eat any			2
that 's right , we 're talking about mock meat			0
given how important flesh is to the traditional @entity144 diet , it 's no surprise @entity17 's fake meat -- usually made of soy protein or wheat gluten -- can fool even hardcore carnivores			1
yes , there have been scandals that revealed actual meat inside supposed mock meat dishes			0
but it 's is a thriving industry here and is considered a staple across @entity17			2
mock meat stir - fries in particular taste surprisingly like the real thing			0
@entity261 baseball baseball may be @entity17 's most popular sport -- diamonds are almost as common as dumplings around the island			1
@entity17 holds the record for the most @entity269 championship titles ( 17 ) , nearly double that of its closest runner - up , @entity213			1
adding to a cabinet of trophies , a team from @entity17 won the 2013 @entity274			1
national health coverage in a year when the @entity278 debacle played out in global headlines , it 's worth to noting that @entity17 has what many call the best universal healthcare system in the world			1
legal residents can visit any specialist in the country			2
docs anywhere will pull up their entire medical record via smart card , consult and prescribe @entity144 medicine and / or prescription drugs			2
fees are billed directly to and reimbursed by the @entity292 , whose 2 % administrative costs are the lowest in the world			2
@entity91 obsession @entity17 's obsession with the @entity213 - born @entity299 character does n't stop at feline - themed restaurants			2
@entity17 holds the distinction of being the first in the world to be honored with @entity91 - branded beer			1
brewed by @entity306 , the drink purred its way onto the shelves earlier this year			0
the light brew features fruity flavors , from lime to a distinctly avant garde banana infusion			0
@entity313 in 2013 made headlines with the resurrection of its themed planes , which feature the ubiquitous cat on everything from exterior liveries to headrest covers to fruit , which is cut in the shape of you know what			0
@entity313 ' dedicated @entity326 site offers horizon - expanding trivia , including @entity91 's height ( five apples tall ) and weight ( three apples )			0
the @entity333 in @entity334 offers @entity91 - themed rooms , the cat 's iconic ribbon and / or silhouette stamped on everything within eye ( sore ) 's reach			0
@entity343 kitty curtains , kitty bath amenities , kitty tea set and a radio that plays @entity91 music are all involved			0
not reaching for the insulin shot yet ? then you can book a breakfast date with a talking and moving " live " @entity91			0
little dumplings yes , we recognize xiaolongbao as a delicacy homegrown in @entity148 , but @entity17 is slowly taking over the dumpling world , one broth - filled bite at a time			1
starting from a single shop in @entity140 , @entity358 now serves its famed xiaolongbao in destinations as far flung as @entity362 , @entity363 and the @entity12			2
two of its @entity187 branches have earned a coveted @entity367 star , with the mothership @entity368 in @entity140 sneaking into the @entity370			2
not bad for a chain restaurant , and not a " fancy " one at that			0
when @entity374 visited @entity17 in 2013 , he joined in on the 18 - pleats - per - dumpling action with a cooking class at the shop 's @entity378 branch			2
even better ? @entity0 put @entity358 at number two on its list of best franchises for travelers			0
with additional reporting by @entity385			0

about 70 % of @entity17 tourists will visit a night market
@entity140 houses a collection of 650,000 @entity144 artifacts and art -- largest in the world
