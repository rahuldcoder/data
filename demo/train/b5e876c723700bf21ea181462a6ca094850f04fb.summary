-- the third " b " in the collapse of our national security system and the @entity5 hit this week			0
the release of five very high - value terrorist leaders as a swap for one @entity10 serviceman was the third strike against the @entity14 administration 's policy of defeat , dishonesty and self - delusion			1
when @entity18 starts investigating the @entity20 case it must broaden the analysis to look at the common patterns which connect it to the administration 's approach on two other national security questions : @entity27 and @entity28			1
the first was @entity31 's @entity5 's decision from 2011 to 2013 to reject requests by the @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and many congressmen and senators on both sides of the aisle to list @entity40 's @entity27 as a terrorist organization			1
well before @entity27 abducted more than 200 girls from a school in northern @entity40 in april , the @entity5 's arguments for keeping the @entity40 extremist group off the list were almost exactly the arguments used to distort what happened in @entity28 , @entity49 , on september 11 , 2012 , and to justify releasing five extraordinarily dangerous @entity51 leaders			1
@entity27 , we were told , was a local organization without aspirations to international terrorism			1
this assessment required us to ignore the fact that @entity27 's first base camp in northern @entity40 was called " @entity59 " in honor of the @entity51			1
it required us to ignore the fact that the group burned @entity64 churches on christmas day			2
it required us to ignore the fact that members of @entity27 went to @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity59 for training			1
none of this , self - delusional " experts " in the @entity5 assured us , meant that @entity27 was a " real " terrorist organization			1
then in 2012 came riots in @entity74 and @entity28 , among other places in the @entity77 world			1
these were not caused by vicious , anti-american religious extremists , the experts assured us -- that would have violated the @entity5 ethos of appeasing others and blaming ourselves -- but by a @entity83 video			0
then - secretary of state @entity31 eventually went so far as to disavow the content of the video on behalf of the @entity10 people			0
just as the apology machine began to run at full speed , blaming the obscure filmmaker and absolving the mob of its permanent willingness to attack the @entity10 for any reason , along came the attack that killed the @entity10 ambassador and three other @entity10 in @entity28			1
the self - deluding national security machine lied to the entire country and denied what really happened at @entity28			1
the driving force in the lies was the @entity101 @entity5 , which specifically asked for the intelligence community analysis to be changed			0
now we have the most disastrous of the three " @entity104 " : @entity20			1
while we can be glad an @entity10 soldier has been returned from captivity , the release of five senior enemy commanders is a defeat of the first order			1
@entity51 leader @entity111 declared the swap a great victory			2
the @entity51 got everything it asked for			0
this swap was a surrender , not a negotiation			1
it 's likely that the five @entity51 leaders will all go into action immediately			2
the notion that their presence in @entity124 restricts them is just one more example of self - delusion and dishonesty by the @entity5			0
both the @entity129 and the @entity5 have identified @entity124 as a hot bed of fundraising for radical @entity77			0
the @entity124 have consistently meddled in @entity132 countries on the side of radicals and against the @entity10 the return of the senior @entity51 commanders is as big a defeat as @entity10 has suffered in a very long time			0
who knows how many will die when these five leaders resume their war against the @entity142 ? @entity51 video shows @entity20 's release in @entity59 president @entity14 released the five @entity51 leaders without ever consulting his @entity59 " allies , " who must feel very threatened between the previous week 's announcement by the president of an arbitrary @entity10 withdrawal date and now the unilateral release of five of their mortal enemies			1
the @entity154 's selfishness , self - centeredness and duplicity abandons allies when they become " inconvenient			2
" @entity14 's foreign policy successes seem to come at enormous cost to other people			2
the president 's argument that we simply had to cut a deal for sgt. @entity20 because of his health goes against the @entity10 experience in every recent war			1
in @entity170 , many @entity10 prisoners of war were held longer than @entity20 and 114 died in captivity			1
in the @entity172 , more than 7,100 @entity10 became prisoners of war and just over 2,700 are known to have died in captivity			2
the six soldiers at center of @entity179 debate what president @entity14 really did this week is to guarantee a much lower military interest in risking life and limb to take high - value prisoners alive given that there is now a possibility that they will released in the future			2
instead , missions will be more focused on killing than capturing these targets			0
@entity31 wanted tougher deal for @entity20 , former officials say the @entity14 team clearly believed that chanting " we do n't leave @entity10 behind " would be a winning argument			2
every spokesperson for the administration repeated the line			0
@entity198 , now national security adviser , replayed her post-benghazi role of going on sunday shows and either misleading or lying to the @entity10 people , claiming that this was " a joyous day			0
" one final example of the @entity154 's passion for self - delusion and dishonesty			2
secretary of defense @entity208 asserted that we never negotiated with the @entity51			0
other administration figures took up that claim			0
opinion : five tough ethics issues in @entity20 swap it is so pathetic a lie it is hard to understand how he could say it with a straight face			1
the claim is that the @entity124 talked to the @entity51			0
in this case , of course , the @entity124 were our agents and were negotiating for us			0
but we are asked to indulge the deceit			0
the @entity5 may be the second-most urgent reform target after @entity229			0
@entity18 should link together the three " @entity104 " and understand that we are faced with delusion across our national security apparatus			0
join us on @entity233 / @entity232 .			0

@entity235 says the *problems* with the @entity20 case are part of a larger pattern
he links the @entity40 terror group @entity27 and deaths in @entity28 to soldier 's release
he calls the swap for five prisoners a surrender , not a negotiation
