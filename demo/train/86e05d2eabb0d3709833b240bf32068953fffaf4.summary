-- for the first time in his life , @entity1 gets up at 5 a.m. to do something other than play basketball			1
the former @entity7 forward has played since kindergarten , but major knee surgery ended the highly recruited player 's @entity11 dreams			1
he still gets choked up talking about it			2
" you just get used to always practicing and being with the guys , " @entity1 said			1
" when you get in that type of injury situation when you 're trying to make it , well , i just ca n't talk about it yet			2
" what @entity1 does talk about with great enthusiasm is the college degree he earned in december			1
it was exactly what he needed to land his first job			0
it was the first thing they asked about when he interviewed at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32			0
when he got the job , he immediately sent a grateful text to @entity7 assistant athletics director @entity35			1
" @entity1 sent me a text saying , ' hey , thanks for looking out for me			1
i did need this degree , ' " @entity35 said			0
" i told him , ' see , that 's exactly the message we 've been trying you to get this entire time			1
' " secretary of education @entity47 wants to see a lot more happy academic advisers because the reality is , a lot of players who do exceptionally well on the court struggle outside of the spotlight			1
men 's @entity57 basketball players have one of the worst graduation rates in college sports , according to a study by the @entity63 in @entity64			1
more than a dozen schools did n't graduate at least half their players in recent seasons , according to the study , which looked at how many players completed their degrees in six years			1
for instance , the @entity70 graduates 25 % of its players ; the @entity73 graduates 38 % , @entity74 45 % , and at @entity75 it was 47 %			1
those figures exclude star players who leave school early to play in the @entity11			0
few make it to the next level that 's a real problem			1
on average , only about 1 % of college players go pro and only a small percentage more get a job playing overseas			0
to even coach the game they know so well , players need to get a degree			0
@entity47 , a co-captain at @entity88 in the mid- 1980s , said he played ball growing up on the streets of @entity91 with far too many guys who did n't graduate			0
those guys , he says , were really lost after basketball ended			1
" there were all these amazing stars who generated lots of money for the universities they played for and had nothing , zero , to show for it after the season , " @entity47 said			0
" i always felt that was morally wrong			0
" @entity47 decided to do something about it			0
using his bully pulpit as education secretary , he went on tv programs , held news conferences and wrote editorials suggesting teams that fail to graduate at least 40 % of their players should be banned from postseason tournaments			1
" to have an advocate like @entity117 is a good kind of push , " said @entity115 president @entity114			1
" it was moving in that direction anyway , and we were able to accelerate it			0
" last fall the @entity115 voted on a postseason ban for teams that do n't graduate about 50 % of their players four years in a row			1
that means last year 's men 's national champions , the @entity70 , will be banned from the 2013 tournament no matter how well they play next season			1
" i think it 's the culture around college basketball , " @entity114 said			2
" we 've got a society that teaches young men in particular that if you can play ball , dribble , focus on that			0
that will get you into college			0
that will get you into the @entity11			0
" but now we need to say that 's important , but it does n't work unless you have school work alongside it and are prepared to be a college student			2
" lost sight of the goal former @entity70 center @entity151 said he probably did go about college all the wrong way			1
" i know when i was a student , i looked too far ahead at the glitz and stars and glamour of the @entity11 instead of taking it one step at a time with school , " he said			0
while he knew his place on the court , even early on he says he felt a little lost in the classroom			2
there were tutors and people at @entity70 to help him if he asked for it , but he says he struggles with @entity170 ( attention - deficit disorder )			1
" i got into some grade trouble , " he said			0
" staying up with the studies and staying up with the help while i was playing basketball ... it just did n't work out for me			0
" in 2009 , @entity151 said @entity70 asked him , as a senior , to " take a break " from his studies			1
he went home to @entity182 three classes shy of graduation			0
while @entity151 says he is still working out and still trying hard to make it to the @entity11 , until then he has had a hard time finding work without a degree			1
he 's had to cobble together a variety of low paying basketball jobs : helping his dad coach an aau team , running skills drills for his sister and her friends at an aau camp and playing semi-pro ball for the @entity197 for about $ 75 a game			1
" everyone wants to go pro. we all chase those dreams , " @entity47 said			0
" but the number of players who will make money playing basketball is minute			0
we always say , ' @entity208 that dream , but catch an education			0
' " the long college basketball season is a grind , said one college official " they play over 30 games a season -- and that 's even before the tournament from early november through march -- and it 's incredible stress on any student , " said @entity213 , who became president of @entity70 in august			1
when she got the job , @entity213 said she knew she inherited a real academic problem with the basketball team			2
she immediately went to work getting services in place to help the struggling students and getting every adult who worked with the team on board with the academic mission			2
now she even gets players ' grades regularly sent to her so she can personally make sure they are on track to graduate			0
" in the past , i think the general problem was lack of support , " @entity213 said			2
while @entity213 agrees that teams need to take academics seriously , @entity70 appealed the postseason ban , but was denied by the @entity115			1
@entity213 thinks the penalty is unfair , since the ban is based on past players ' academic performance rather than that of the current team , which is decidedly better			2
" for me as an educator , as a parent , to see our current students -- who are going to class and doing this kind of thing , who would be model student athletes in anybody 's view -- to see them get punished for something students a few years ago failed to do is heartbreaking			2
" @entity7 a model program @entity70 would like to have the type of success they have at @entity7			1
they have had great academic and athletic success with its student - athletes			2
the perennial basketball powerhouse has graduated all of its players in some years			0
this year it 's 91 %			1
rev. @entity269 , the @entity271 university 's president , said the key to its success is the individualized attention it gives to players			2
that approach stems from the @entity278 tradition on which the school was founded			0
" part of who we are as a @entity278 university makes us insist that we care for these students from every point of the compass , " @entity269 said			0
" we have this tradition called cura personalis - which goes back to the 16th century and really is rooted in @entity289 's experience of how @entity290 treated him as a unique individual -- and that 's how we want to treat all our students			2
we really try to stress meeting them where they are individually and then moving them along so they achieve well academically			0
" @entity1 said like @entity151 , he struggled with @entity170 and had a few other learning disabilities			1
graduation for him was not a guarantee			0
" i had to go to junior college to get my grades up , but when i got here they taught me how to do the best i could with the talents i have , " @entity1 said			1
when @entity7 players are selected to play for the school , they immediately know academics will be emphasized when they get there			1
even before they start their freshmen year , they attend mandatory summer school			2
that 's where they can get used to college - level work and that 's also where the athletics academic director can see where the players are academically			1
" from that point , then we know how to approach the school year , " @entity35 said			2
" we know then right off the bat if a player needs a tutor in math because that 's not their strong point , and we can create an academic program that 's just for them			1
" in @entity1 's case , @entity331 discovered he was a visual learner			1
so they helped him design a set of note cards for any class he took to help him study			0
" when i got to my new job , i had to laugh because there on everyone 's desk to help them with their sales calls were note cards ! i 'm like , ' damn , everyone is using note cards			2
i know what to do with those			0
' " @entity1 said he built up exactly the right study habits to succeed			1
" i learned it 's like making free throws			2
all kids need consistent repetition to learn			0
everything is repetition , " he said			0
it also meant being constantly watched by his academic advisors			2
players must swipe in and swipe out of study hall with a card that keeps track of how long they 're in there			0
computer programs monitor their class attendance and grades			0
tutors fly with the team to away games and chartered planes rush them back to campus in time for class			0
@entity1 said the academic team also has spies everywhere			1
" i know they 'd even ask the people who delivered the papers to the academic center if they 've seen us and how long we 've been there , " he said , laughing			1
" they really stayed on me about my class work because they cared			0
and , well , i felt like i had to give into them at some point			0
