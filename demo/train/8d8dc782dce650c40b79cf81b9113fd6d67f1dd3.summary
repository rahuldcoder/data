@entity0 -- when i was growing up , my friends and i all wanted to be cool -- like @entity4 , @entity5 or , of course , the king of cool at the time : @entity10			0
( i should note that i grew up in an @entity12 neighborhood			0
) being " cool " was a good thing			1
today it appears that being " cool " could be a bad thing , at least if you are running for president of the @entity18			2
that theory surfaced in an ad from a @entity22 super pac headed by @entity23			1
the super @entity24 argues in its campaign ad that @entity26 is " too cool " to be president			1
the attack ad shows president @entity26 " slow jamming " the news on @entity32 's @entity31 late - night talk show , singing an @entity34 song and chugging a beer			1
( @entity26 drinking a beer must confuse those @entity22 who still think he is a @entity37			2
) sure , @entity26 can sing , spar with late - night comedians and charm talk - show hosts			2
still i am not so sure i would classify him as being " too cool			0
" to me , @entity26 is more of a mix of cool and nerdy -- sort of a cross between @entity45 and @entity46			2
@entity26 may have soul , but he likely also has " @entity49 " toys			2
you could even say he may be more geeky than cool			0
@entity26 has long collected comic books and when he recently posed for a picture with the actress who played @entity54 on " @entity55 , " @entity26 admitted he was a @entity56 -- he even flashed the @entity58 salute which means " live long and prosper			2
on the geek to cool meter , that definitely tips towards geekdom			0
and yet in today 's world , geeks can actually be cool			2
they 're no longer depicted the way they were in the " @entity66 " movies with pocket protectors , calculator watches and @entity71 - bottle lens glasses			0
geeky people are the model of success , the ultimate expression of cool -- think the late @entity77			0
at the risk of agreeing with @entity23 , i think he 's correct that @entity26 would be considered cool			1
but is that bad ? @entity23 thinks so			0
indeed , @entity23 's ad claims that " @entity18 got one cool president " but then cites statistics showing job losses for young people			1
the ad concludes by posing the question : " after four years of a celebrity president , is your life any better ? " taking @entity23 's argument to its logical " @entity94 " - type conclusion -- if @entity26 was not cool , he would be a great president and @entity18 would be better off			1
let 's see if that theory is accurate			0
no one would argue that @entity98 was cool			0
yet if @entity23 's proposition is correct , @entity98 should have been one of the greatest presidents ever			1
while some may miss @entity98 -- and those people would be mostly comedians such as myself -- by the time he left office , he had a 22 % approval rating , one of the lowest ever for an outgoing president			0
so it appears that lack of cool does not equal fantastic president			0
what is @entity23 's real point ? is it personal ? was @entity23 picked on as a child by the cool kids in his school ? did they give him wedgies or not let him sit with them at the lunch table in the cafeteria ? is this ad simply @entity23 's " @entity66 " moment to lash out at @entity26 for being the cool guy ? maybe but more likely it 's political			1
@entity23 knows that the presumptive @entity22 nominee @entity127 is at best " cool - challenged			1
" @entity23 is simply trying to turn one of @entity26 's assets into a liability			1
will it work ? do we want a less than cool president ? and if this ad gets traction , will @entity23 release other ads attacking @entity26 's strengths ? will we soon see ads claiming @entity26 is " too articulate " or in too good a shape to be president ? only time will tell , but if this is the type of ridiculous argument we are hearing six months from @entity144 , i ca n't even imagine the insanity we will see as we get closer to november 6			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			0

a @entity23 - led super pac ran ad saying @entity26 is " cool " but *ineffective*
@entity148 says he thought being cool was a good thing
he says @entity23 's group realizes @entity127 is " cool - challenged "
@entity148 : the ad seeks to *convert* an @entity26 positive into a *negative*
