@entity0 -- republicans were facing pressure tuesday to vote for a rollback of across - the - board cuts in @entity7 payments to health providers after a major doctors ' group said the cuts could lead to a " meltdown " of the government 's health care system for the elderly			1
doctors say they would take on fewer @entity7 patients if the cuts go into effect			1
on monday , senate majority leader @entity20 , @entity21 , called several @entity2 trying to persuade them to support a bill that would reverse a 10.6 percent cut in @entity7 payments to doctors			1
the cuts in @entity7 payments -- part of a scheduled cost - saving formula -- went into effect july 1 , although the @entity32 administration said it will hold off on processing claims until mid-july to give @entity35 time to reach a compromise			1
the @entity7 system pays for the health care of roughly 40 million elderly @entity40			2
rising health care costs have made @entity7 a growing part of the federal budget , and the stress on the system is increasing as more baby boomers reach retirement age			2
similar cuts have been scheduled to go into effect on july 1 in previous years , but @entity35 always has voted to stop the cuts before they went into effect			1
@entity51 , a family physician who practices in @entity52 , @entity53 , said the cuts could lead to doctors taking fewer @entity7 patients , making it difficult for the program 's elderly patients to get the care they need			1
" this @entity7 access problem is a real issue , not just a political football , " said @entity51 , who said 35 percent of his patients were eligible for @entity7			1
" it affects your dad , when he 's sick			0
it affects my patients in my practice			0
this has to be addressed			0
" a vote on the bill last week fell one shy of the 60 needed to clear a @entity2 filibuster and advance in the @entity74			1
@entity74 @entity2 joined the @entity75 in objecting to the @entity77 - back bill because it paid for the increased payments to doctors by trimming government support for private insurance programs that provide coverage to @entity7 patients			1
the private @entity7 programs are a top policy initiative for @entity2			1
the issue has become the subject of an intense election - year lobbying and advertising campaign aimed primarily at its @entity2 opponents			2
the @entity91 , a powerful doctor 's group , said its members may be forced to reduce service to @entity7 patients if the cuts go into effect			1
according to a recent association survey , 60 percent of physicians will be forced to limit the number of new @entity7 patients they can take on if the july 1 cuts go into effect			1
" we stand at the brink of a @entity7 meltdown			2
... for doctors , this is not a partisan issue -- it 's a patient access issue , " @entity91 president @entity106 said in a statement after the @entity74 vote last week			2
the @entity91 ran radio and tv ads over the @entity116 congressional recess targeting 10 @entity2 senators , seven of whom are up for re-election			2
the @entity121 , the nation 's largest organization of retired persons , and other groups also are weighing in against the cuts			0
@entity20 has " no idea " if the pressure has changed any minds , but the " proof will be in the pudding " when senators vote again to break the filibuster , said @entity134 , a spokesman for the speaker			0
that vote is likely to occur wednesday			0
" there is clearly a lot of pressure , " sen. @entity137 , @entity138 , chairman of the @entity139 , said monday			0
@entity137 said he has talked to several @entity2 and " there are a few " who could switch their votes			0
but @entity2 lawmakers and aides gave no indication the intense lobbying had changed any minds , and even if the bill does pass the @entity74 , it may still face a presidential veto			1
republicans " are holding out for a compromise that can pass and the president can sign , " said a top @entity2 leadership aide			0
at the heart of the dispute is the decision by @entity77 lawmakers to pay for the " doctors ' fix " by cutting funds for @entity164 , a program administered by private insurance companies that is generally favored by @entity2 and opposed by @entity77			2
the program , which has more benefits than traditional @entity7 , is also more expensive			0
republicans -- joined by the insurance industry -- fear @entity77 are trying to weaken the @entity7 alternative by draining funds away from it			0
president @entity32 has threatened to veto the legislation because of the cuts to @entity164 -- so that even if @entity77 get one additional vote to beat a filibuster , they will need several more to override a veto			2
the @entity177 passed the bill 359 - 55 with broad @entity2 support in june , but the two - thirds vote needed to override a presidential veto appears , at the moment , to be an insurmountable barrier in the @entity74			1
" our goal is to get a result , " said @entity74 minority leader @entity184 , @entity185			0
" a vetoed bill is not a result			0
" @entity190 on monday pressed for a monthlong extension of the current fee schedule so senators could work on a compromise			0
@entity1 's @entity195 and @entity196 contributed to this report			0
