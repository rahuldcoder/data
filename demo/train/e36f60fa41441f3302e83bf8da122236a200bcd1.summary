editor 's note : @entity2 , @entity3 , is president of the @entity4 and professor of internal medicine at the @entity7			2
he specializes in the treatment of breast cancer and lymphoma and was in private practice for 17 years in @entity12			0
@entity13 , @entity14 , is president of the @entity15 and clinical professor of nursing at @entity18			2
she was the first nurse and first woman to be chief operating officer of @entity21			0
@entity2 says a health care bill provision on end - of - life care has been completely misconstrued			1
( @entity24 ) -- the heated national debate on health care reform has taken an unusual turn , with many eyes focused on a minor provision regarding end - of - life care embedded in the @entity31 bill			1
the measure provides coverage for @entity35 beneficiaries who elect to meet with their medical team once every five years to discuss options for treatment if they become seriously ill. it 's called end - of - life care or advance care planning			1
some opponents of the @entity31 bill have expended great energy and resources in recent weeks to convince seniors that this provision will somehow result in government - sponsored euthanasia			1
we have seen the volatile response to these allegations at town hall meetings across the country			0
this argument is completely false			0
this provision simply provides for @entity35 to pay for voluntary conversations between patients and their health care practitioners on the difficult but important subject of planning for care at the end of life			1
the provision is purely optional , and patients would be able to choose whether to discuss the issue with their practitioners			0
for those who decide to do so , there would be clear benefits			0
these discussions can include where a person wants to receive care and how physical needs , including pain , are to be managed			0
the merits of broader health care reform legislation aside , there should be no controversy about the benefits of end - of - life care planning discussions			1
according to a 2008 study in the @entity86 , these discussions have been proven to improve patient care and quality of life			2
confronting the prospect of death is n't easy for anyone			0
so perhaps it 's no surprise that few people talk with their doctors , nurses or loved ones about their wishes for end - of - life care			1
surveys show that only 13 percent of @entity101 have established a living will laying out their desires for treatment near death , and shared it with their medical teams			0
we discuss end - of - life care with patients to fulfill our commitment to them throughout the course of their care			1
when a disease can not be cured , we can assure our patients that we can make them comfortable in their last days			0
when these conversations are done in advance and done well , everyone benefits -- patients , families and all members of our care teams			2
as practitioners , we know from experience that discussions with patients in the end stages of their cancers and with their family members may be long and emotional , but ultimately lead to end - of - life care centered on the patient 's wishes			1
we have seen many patients who were well - cared - for by their families , with professional help , and were comfortable in their surroundings			0
we know , through research and through our own experience , that patients who have discussed end - of - life care make better - informed treatment decisions , experience less pain and depression , and fare better overall			1
ireport.com : share your hopes for health care reform at some point , we all will need to make decisions about care at the end of life			1
whether ill or not , every @entity101 should think ahead about the kind of treatment they want , discuss their desires with their loved ones and their doctors and nurses , and develop living wills to document their wishes			0
a new @entity35 benefit that acknowledges the value of end - of - life conversations between health care practitioners and patients is long overdue and should be included in any health care reform bill			1
it is good medicine and improves the lives of patients -- exactly what policymakers say they are looking for in health care reform			2
more importantly , it would help all @entity101 live their final days with dignity and in accord with their own wishes			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity13 .			2
