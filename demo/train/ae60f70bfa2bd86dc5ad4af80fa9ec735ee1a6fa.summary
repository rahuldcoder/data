-- it has been more than a year since the @entity3 government withdrew its ambassador to @entity5 and closed its embassy in @entity7			1
on thursday , that ambassador returned to the region along with a @entity3 delegation , touring a @entity5 refugee camp in @entity12 to bring more attention to the growing humanitarian crisis			1
as the civil war has intensified in @entity5 , hundreds of thousands of people have sought refuge in @entity12 , @entity18 , @entity19 and other neighboring countries			2
ambassador @entity21 gave an exclusive interview to @entity0 's @entity23 and described what the @entity3 is doing to help the refugees and the @entity5 opposition			1
@entity23 : the @entity3 has given $ 210 million in aid ( to @entity5 ) , but i think that there is a perception problem because no one can actually point at what that help is			1
so people conclude there is no help			0
@entity21 : the assistance is going in			0
it 's things like tents , it 's things like blankets , it 's things like medical equipment , but it does n't come in big boxes with an @entity3 flag on it because we do n't want the people who are delivering it to be targeted by the @entity5 regime			1
the regime is going after and killing people who are delivering supplies			0
you see them bombing even bakeries and bread lines			0
so we 're doing that , in part , to be discrete			0
so even though a great deal of @entity3 materials and other countries ' materials are arriving , the needs are still greater			2
and that 's why we 're going to @entity67 to talk to the @entity68 and to talk to other countries about how we can talk together to provide additional assistance			2
@entity23 : the head of the @entity72 , which the @entity3 government has backed , came out with a statement very critical of the international community , saying we need $ 3 billion if you want us to have any say on events on the ground inside @entity5			1
where is that money ? ford : ( sheikh ahmed ) @entity82 is a good leader , and we think highly of him and we have recognized his ( coalition ) as the legitimate representative of the @entity5 people			2
and , of course , he wants to get as many resources as possible because of the humanitarian conditions that i was just talking about			0
especially the ones inside @entity5			2
but we also , at the same time , have to build up those ( aid ) networks i was talking about			0
in some cases , they start out with just a few people			0
we do n't need just a few people , we need hundreds of people , thousands of people on the inside of @entity5 organized to bring these things in			2
and so step by step , the @entity5 , @entity82 and his organization , need to build that capacity			2
we can help build it , we can do training and things like that			0
but in the end , @entity5 have to take a leadership role in this			2
@entity23 : is @entity113 giving money to the @entity72 ? @entity115 : we absolutely are assisting the ( coalition ) , with everything from training to , in some cases , limited amount of cash assistance so that they can buy everything ranging from computers to telephones to radios			1
frankly , if not for the @entity3 assistance in many cases , the activists inside @entity5 would n't be in contact with the outside world			1
it 's @entity3 help that keeps them in contact with the outside world			1
@entity23 : but , how much assistance has this coalition gotten from the @entity3 ? @entity115 : so far , we 've allocated directly to the coalition in the neighborhood of $ 35 million worth of different kinds of equipment and assistance			1
and over the next few weeks , couple of months , we 'll probably provide another $ 15 million worth of material assistance			1
@entity23 : @entity113 recently blacklisted @entity142 , the @entity142 , calling it a terrorist organization even though inside @entity5 , it has attracted a lot of respect for its victories and for comparative lack of corruption compared to many rebel groups			1
how has blacklisting the @entity142 helped the @entity5 opposition ? @entity115 : we blacklisted the @entity142 because of its intimate links with @entity152 in @entity153 , an organization with whom we have direct experience , which is responsible for the killings of thousands of @entity153 , hundreds of @entity3			1
we know what @entity152 in @entity153 did and is still doing , and we do n't want it to start doing that in @entity5 -- which is why we highlighted its incredibly pernicious role			2
i think one of the things that our classification of @entity164 as a terrorist group did is it set off an alarm for the other elements of the @entity169			0
there was a meeting of the @entity169 to set up a unified command , ( and ) @entity142 was not in that meeting -- which we think is the right thing to do			0
as @entity5 themselves understand that @entity164 has a sectarian agenda , as they understand better that @entity164 is anti-democratic and will seek to impose its very strict interpretation of @entity179 on @entity5 -- which historically is a relatively moderate country in terms of its religious practices -- as @entity5 understand that better , i think they will more and more reject the @entity142 itself			0
@entity23 : but i 've seen the opposite			0
as i go into @entity5 , i hear more and more support and respect for the @entity142 , and more and more criticism for the @entity3 government each time i go back			1
@entity115 : i think that people , @entity189 , are still understanding what @entity164 is			0
i have heard criticism from the @entity142 from people like @entity82 who , in @entity193 ( @entity194 ) in his speech , said he rejected the kind of ideology which backs up @entity164			0
... we have heard that from the senior commander of the @entity169 as well			0
and so the more people understand inside @entity5 what @entity164 is and represents , i think they will agree that is not the group on which to depend for freedom in @entity5			0
@entity23 : do you think the @entity3 government could have done more ? @entity115 : i think the @entity5 , as i said , are the ones who will bring the answer to the problem -- just as in @entity153 , @entity153 brought the solution to the @entity153 crisis , to the @entity153 war			1
the @entity3 can help , and we helped in @entity153 , but ultimately it was n't the @entity3			0
despite our help , it was @entity153			0
in @entity5 , again , it has to be @entity5 who find their way forward			1
twenty - three million @entity5 need to find their way forward			1
we can help , and we are helping : $ 210 million in humanitarian assistance , $ 50 million to help the political opposition get organized for the day after ( @entity224 ) @entity223 goes			1
these are important bits of help			0
but ultimately , it 's not the @entity3 help			1
it 's the @entity5 themselves .			2

the @entity3 ambassador to @entity5 says the @entity3 has provided $ 210 million in humanitarian aid
the assistance has to be discrete , he said , to *protect* workers from being targeted
@entity113 has also provided $ 35 million worth of assistance to @entity5 's political opposition
ambassador : we can help , but it 's up to @entity5 to find their way forward
