@entity1 's rocky and inauspicious path to leadership of the @entity3 could haunt him if he does n't watch his step			0
" if people feel @entity11 makes a mistake in the future , they will come after him even harder than if this ugly process of recent weeks had n't happened , " said @entity5 , a senior fellow at the @entity6 and a co-author of " @entity8 : @entity16 's @entity15			1
" the former @entity19 senator 's nomination as defense secretary was subject to harsh criticism from some fellow @entity22 over past statements on sensitive political and national security matters			1
his shaky performance at his confirmation hearing and the subsequent fierce political wrangling over his selection and on unrelated matters did not help his case			0
but efforts to further delay his nomination were swept away on tuesday as the @entity33 confirmed him , 58 - 41 , with a handful of @entity22 votes in his corner			1
@entity11 will be sworn in on wednesday , succeeding @entity37			1
president @entity16 , a former @entity33 colleague , called @entity11 a patriot who " fought and bled for our country			1
" @entity16 said he will count on @entity11 's " counsel and judgment " as the @entity43 ends combat operations in @entity45 and stays " ready to meet the threats of our time			1
" the task for @entity11 , 66 , going forward is to swiftly move past the protracted nomination battle , prove himself a strong and capable @entity3 chief , and repair relationships on @entity54 , said @entity55 , a former homeland security adviser to president @entity56			1
" of course , when he walks through the door he is bruised and battered			0
but i think we should n't overestimate the impact of that , " @entity55 said			0
" frankly , once he is confirmed as secretary of defense and once he sits in the seat and takes on the mantle of responsibility , everyone in the @entity3 is going to stand up and salute smartly , as well they should			0
" @entity11 , a decorated @entity68 veteran , said in a statement that he was honored to have been nominated and confirmed , and pledged to work closely with @entity70 to " ensure that we maintain the strongest military in the world			1
" with @entity11 's confirmation , @entity16 has put in place another crucial piece of his second - term national security team			1
@entity78 has been installed as secretary of state and @entity80 is awaiting @entity33 action on his nomination to be @entity84 director			2
@entity85 is already serving as national security adviser			1
@entity5 said @entity11 would not " be damaged goods " and the political outcry over his nomination would quickly be overshadowed by the latest budget drama engulfing @entity90 over spending cuts , which would hit the @entity3 hard , if enacted			2
bad feelings about @entity11 stem , in part , from his 2007 comments that the " jewish lobby intimidated lawmakers			2
" republicans who are already uncomfortable with @entity16 's policies toward @entity100 are uneasy about a defense secretary holding such views			2
@entity100 's ambassador to the @entity43 , @entity103 , said in a statement that @entity100 " looks forward to working closely " with @entity11			2
@entity11 's criticism of the @entity106 , the @entity107 , and his past positions on @entity110 and on @entity43 military intervention also raised red flags with his opponents			1
moreover , he spoke about an ambassadorial nominee in the late 1990s as being " openly , ggressively gay , " remarks for which he has since apologized			0
@entity16 ended the prohibition on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military			2
and @entity11 has n't been sparing in his criticism of conservative and @entity22 figures , saying radio show hosts like @entity126 " try to rip everybody down " but " do n't have any answers , " and labeling @entity56 as callous on @entity128 when he was president			1
last week , 15 @entity22 senators sent a letter to @entity16 calling on him to withdraw @entity11 's nomination			1
@entity133 sen. @entity132 , the ranking @entity22 on the @entity134 and a fierce @entity11 critic , did not sign the letter			1
but he led the charge against him in the @entity33 , stalling the nomination at one point in exchange for more information from the @entity142 on the deadly september terror attack on the @entity43 diplomatic mission in @entity145 , @entity146			2
the real reasons why conservative groups are still going after @entity11 that sentiment gained traction in conservative circles			0
" there is simply no way to sugar coat it			0
senator @entity11 's performance before the @entity134 was remarkably inept and we should not be installing a defense secretary who is obviously not qualified for the job and who holds dangerously misguided views on some of the most important issues facing national security policy for our country , " said @entity156 sen. @entity156 of @entity157			1
vote no and send a message to @entity11 there was a healthy serving of politics behind the @entity174 pushback , some experts say			0
he is n't the only potential member of @entity16 's first or second - term cabinet to be grilled during the nomination process			2
at the start of his first term , @entity16 's pick to lead the @entity180 , @entity181 , emerged from a tough confirmation fight in the wake of recession to help push through @entity189 reform as well as the banking and auto industry rescues			2
his successor , @entity192 , is expected to be confirmed			0
some republicans also believed that @entity11 , like @entity194 , was vulnerable in a divided political climate in @entity90 made more sharply partisan by @entity16 's re-election , according to experts			1
@entity198 , the @entity43 ambassador to the @entity199 , withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state after drawing heavy criticism from @entity132 and other @entity22 over her public statements about the @entity145 attack			0
@entity207 supporters of @entity11 came to his defense this week as the vote drew near			0
" the president wants him in the room as he 's making important decisions			0
there 's no question about his integrity of character			0
i think the president deserves to have the @entity177 he wants as long as the person is qualified , " @entity219 @entity207 sen. @entity218 said on " @entity220			0
" the consternation over @entity11 's confirmation has been " kabuki theater , " said @entity226 , editor of @entity227			1
" the political divisions that dictated the pace and twists of his confirmation process pre-date him and will post-date his confirmation , " @entity226 said			0
" the reality is that @entity11 wo n't drive ( defense ) policy , the president and @entity240 politics will			0
" and time will heal even these political wounds , @entity226 said .			0

@entity33 votes 58 - 41 to confirm former @entity19 senator , a @entity22
fight for @entity177 post was *deeply* partisan , *uphill* battle for @entity11
@entity16 says he will rely on @entity11 's counsel on national security issues
@entity11 pledges to work with @entity70 ; will be sworn in on wednesday
