for decades , none but a few privileged -- and highly trained -- individuals could dare dream of traveling beyond @entity4 's orbit			0
all that 's set to change as @entity6 brings space exploration to the ( mega-rich ) masses			2
in april , @entity9 -- a subsidiary of @entity11 's @entity10 -- hit a milestone			1
the rocket motor the company had been testing on the ground was fitted into @entity16 , the spacecraft that , from next year onwards , will bring space travel to the general public			1
" we lit the rocket motor for the first time in the air and the spaceship went through the sound barrier , " recalls @entity20 , @entity9 's commercial director			1
" it was a hugely significant milestone for us , and in many ways , the last big piece of the jigsaw			0
" read more : @entity9 one flight closer to space tourism though a ticket aboard @entity16 does n't come cheap -- a seat currently costs $ 250,000 -- @entity20 maintains that as things stand , the fare is a relative bargain			1
" it 's still about 1 % of the price you would have needed to pay to go to space as a private citizen before now , " maintains @entity20			2
indeed , in the past , the privilege cost civilians a fair share			2
when @entity46 , the world 's first " space tourist " bought a seat aboard a @entity52 @entity51 spacecraft in 2001 , it allegedly cost him nearly $ 20 million			1
read more : what does it feel like to be weightless ? though flights wo n't commence until next year at the earliest , @entity9 has already sold 640 seats to space enthusiasts the world over			1
for some , the cost is negligible			0
others , though , have taken second mortgages on their homes to pay for the tickets			0
so what does $ 250,000 buy you ? the experience starts with three days of training at @entity68 in @entity69			1
" there 's a lot to do with getting you psychologically prepared for a trip that is absolutely about sensory overload , " says @entity20			2
read more : @entity75 goes inside the @entity76 the flight itself accommodates six passengers , lasts two and a half hours , and culminates with congratulatory champagne at the spaceport			1
space travelers get to leave their seats to experience several minutes of zero - gravity , and perhaps the most iconic view ever afforded mankind			1
" ultimately , you get memories to last a lifetime -- a trip i think will just blow people away			2
when talking to professional astronauts of the past , they do n't talk about ( their experiences ) for a day or a year , they talk about it for the rest of their lives			0
" still , there are many enthusiasts eager to see the price drop , not the least of whom is @entity107 astronaut @entity106			1
@entity106 recalls the first time he heard the concept of private space travel debated in a meeting room 25 years ago			1
" somebody said , ' how are we going to select ( who gets to fly to space ) ? ' someone in the back of the room said , ' how about a lottery ? ' man , my ears perked up at that , and i became a devotee of a lottery to select people			2
" the civilian lottery is the basis of @entity106 's non-profit , @entity128			1
" i was n't interested in a big pay - off of the profit made			0
i was interested in exposing space to a large number of people , " he says			0
@entity20 himself is eager to see the price drop			0
" this is not just a business for @entity10			0
it 's about the creation of a new and important industry that is going to transform space access			0
one of the byproducts of that is there will be competition , there will be economies of scale , and we should see the price go down , " he says			0
" hopefully there will be a large , thriving , vibrant industry that will make it possible for most people to go into space in my lifetime			0
