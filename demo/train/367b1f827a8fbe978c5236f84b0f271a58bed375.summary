@entity0 is ground zero in a tense power play between @entity2 and the @entity3 , with @entity5 officials saying they just want @entity7 to be allowed to decide their own fate , and @entity2 officials saying they simply want to ensure that @entity2 - speaking @entity7 have a fair say over how they are governed			1
militants , army face off in @entity0 officials from both sides say they do n't want to impose their influence on the former @entity17 satellite , but they have given no indication they would object if the result of this dustup is closer ties : @entity0 is on @entity2 's doorstep and , though short on cash , is awash in natural resources			1
what 's going on in eastern @entity0 ? @entity0 is home to a large number of @entity27 , @entity2 - speaking @entity7 , and is where the play - out of tensions has been most visible			1
on tuesday , acting @entity0 president @entity31 announced an " anti-terrorist operation " to restore order to the country 's east , saying its aim was to " stop attempts to tear @entity0 to pieces			1
" the military then launched its first , formal action against the @entity43 militants who have seized government and police buildings in at least 11 eastern towns and cities			2
on wednesday , helicopters and a fighter jet circled over the city of @entity51 and a column of tanks rolled through the city , one with a @entity2 flag affixed			1
a similar convoy of armored personnel carriers also entered the city of @entity59 , some 100 miles from the border with @entity2			1
but there was little sign that the @entity7 military presence was effective			0
in a village near @entity51 , pro-russian militants surrounded the @entity7 forces , took away their vehicles and forced them to surrender , @entity65 's @entity64 reported			2
they were allowed to depart only after they disabled their weapons			0
@entity2 president @entity72 warned earlier that the escalating tension " essentially puts the nation on the brink of civil war			1
what do the people in the east want ? they want more say in how their affairs are handled			1
@entity0 is currently a unitary state , where @entity83 makes the major decisions that affect the rest of the country , according to @entity87 , a professor of political science at the @entity89 specializing in @entity2 affairs			1
" what folks in the east are asking for is greater autonomy , local self - government , " he said			2
were it to become enshrined in the constitution , that form of autonomy would become a new form of government -- federalism			0
what do @entity2 officials want ? they say they want to protect the rights of ethnic @entity2 , but some observers say @entity72 is wistful for the days of the @entity17			1
" it 's just @entity2 trying to expand back into the borders of its old empire , " said @entity108 , the first @entity5 ambassador to @entity0 under @entity109 , from 1992 - 1993			1
he is now a principal in @entity114 4			0
how did this all start ? it all started with money , or lack thereof			0
when the @entity17 satellite became independent in 1991 , hopes were high that it would succeed , given its rich human and natural resources : vast tracts of arable land and stores of coal , iron ore and titanium , said @entity108			0
at the time , the country was largely unified			0
" when @entity0 held its independence referendum , almost 91 % voted for independence , including the majority of ethnic @entity2 in @entity0 , including @entity134 , " @entity108 said			1
that remained the case in the early to mid- 1990s , when @entity2 nationalists in @entity2 's parliament and in @entity134 wanted @entity134 to break away and become more independent			1
the efforts failed to gain traction			0
but years of massive corruption and economic stagnation took a toll			0
the hopes for a better future deflated , only to be renewed late last year , when @entity0 began negotiating an association agreement with the @entity147			1
then - president @entity148 initially said he would sign it			0
but when he reversed course , deciding instead to sign a deal with @entity2 , fed up @entity7 took to the streets			1
they filled not only @entity153 in the capital city of @entity83 , but protested in western @entity0 and , though to a much lesser extent , in eastern @entity0			1
in february , after dozens of demonstrators had been killed , @entity148 succumbed to the pressure , signing an agreement for a unity government			0
but he then fled to @entity2			2
back in @entity83 , the @entity7 government saw the unity government agreement as null and void and parliament took over , appointing an acting president and prime minister and calling for presidential elections to be held may 25			0
what about @entity134 ? but @entity2 , coming off the success of the @entity169 in @entity170 , declared the new government illegal			2
" with the @entity172 over , @entity72 had a clear opening to move into @entity134 , " @entity108 said			0
" he sent instigators , got the people riled up , introduced troops without insignia , claiming that they were local militia , local citizens			2
" @entity2 has said the uprisings have been the work of @entity182			2
in @entity134 , where @entity2 's @entity184 is based , a referendum was held march 16			1
voters were able to choose to become more independent but stay within @entity0 , or to join @entity2			1
the latter option prevailed by an overwhelming margin			0
@entity72 then moved troops to near the border with @entity0 , " and that 's where we are today , " @entity108 said			1
why did @entity72 move troops to the border with @entity0 ? " he thought he would be able to foment a general uprising , " @entity108 said			2
" that did not happen ; @entity7 stayed quiet			0
" @entity195 said its forces are arrayed along the border to conduct military exercises			0
so then what happened ? @entity72 has been sending provocateurs and special forces masquerading as @entity7 into the zone , @entity108 said , citing news sources as well as sources he would not identify			0
" he 's basically manufactured an environment of instability , " one that lends itself to rebellion , he said			2
@entity2 foreign minister @entity211 , speaking tuesday in @entity212 , rejected as " nonsense " accusations that @entity2 is fomenting the unrest and supporting the militants			2
is it true the country is on the brink of civil war ? @entity87 predicted the tensions will ease " if @entity83 waits them out , " but could escalate if @entity83 resorts to force and there is significant loss of life			1
@entity108 said he doubted a civil war would break out , but said that would depend on how hard the @entity2 push with instigators , whether they introduce troops and how the @entity7 respond			1
he applauded the @entity7 for having responded thus far " in measured terms			0
" rather than allowing themselves to be baited by @entity43 demonstrators , @entity7 forces could simply isolate them , he said			0
" let them sit there -- you could have a stand - down for weeks or months			0
right now , the ones that are pushing the envelope are the @entity2 , not the @entity7			2
" negotiations will prove key , he predicted			0
" the @entity2 are trying to convince the @entity3 there is a civil war that could impact the region , and it 's necessary for the @entity7 government to create a federalist structure , " he said			1
" the great fear now is if the @entity3 buys that line			0
and what if it does ? the drawbacks would be obvious , according to @entity253			0
" by creating a federalist structure you would create regions that are almost autonomous , " he said , citing the educational system , trade practices and the use of language			0
that relative autonomy could undermine the strength of the central government in @entity83 " and is a step away from @entity2 being able to have a referendum along the lines of @entity134 -- which could then lead to a breakaway , " he added			2
" it 's kind of like taking @entity0 one slice at a time			1

what 's going on in eastern @entity0 ?
what do the people in the east want ?
what does @entity2 want ?
is it on the brink of civil war ?
