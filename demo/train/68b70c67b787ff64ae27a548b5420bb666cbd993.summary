-- if @entity3 's time at @entity4 is nearing an end then he seems determined not to go quietly			1
the outspoken @entity7 coach 's time at the @entity9 giants -- one of the world 's biggest soccer clubs -- has been adorned with three major trophies but also with a healthy dose of controversy			1
he has had to fend off regular reports of dressing room unrest and a rift with one of @entity4 's key players , goalkeeper @entity19 , the @entity21 - winning captain of @entity22			1
the 50 - year - old has been strongly linked with a return to the @entity25 and former club @entity26 , with the current coach of the @entity29 - based club hinting on tuesday @entity3 is set to replace him			1
but for the time being , @entity3 remains in situ at @entity4 and used his latest press conference to hit back at defender @entity33 , who had criticized his treatment of the benched @entity19 in the press			1
@entity33 has lost his place in the side to young @entity39 defender @entity38 in recent weeks			1
@entity3 , in typically bullish mood , told reporters : " @entity33 's problem is easy to analyze			1
you do n't have to be a genius , just a normal guy like me to understand that we 're talking about frustration			2
" it 's not easy for a player to see how he 's outperformed by a 19 year - old kid , but the kid is fantastic			2
i had the courage to play him and the problem is very simple			2
@entity33 's life as an athlete has changed			1
" he was permanent starter and it is also one of my decisions that did n't lead to a public discussion			0
i understand his frustration perfectly , and that it translated into what he said			2
" things are clear and i have no issue with him			0
it 's not an easy situation			2
i have to try to be honest and most people think that @entity4 's defensive future is @entity38 and @entity71			1
" @entity3 's decision to drop @entity19 , who has been with @entity4 his entire career and is a poster boy to the club 's many fans , has been met with many questions			1
after @entity19 picked up an injury in january , @entity3 signed @entity80 's @entity79 , and continued to play him even after @entity19 regained full fitness			1
it led to much criticism of the coach , who reiterated on tuesday that @entity79 's style of goalkeeping was more to his liking			1
" i like @entity79 as a goalkeeper more than @entity19 , " he explained			0
" it 's not personal , i just like him more			2
i like a goalkeeper that comes out and dominates the airspace and plays with his feet			0
" @entity19 is fantastic under the posts and i can also say that he likes a coach like ( @entity9 national team coach ) @entity97 or with a different profile more			2
" one 's more offensive , the other defensive			2
i have the right to say this and with me , in normal conditions , @entity79 is going to play			0
people can say what they want , i accept that but please respect a coach who decides who plays			2
" @entity3 's time at the @entity111 has been mixed			1
he has won one @entity113 title , last season , but looks set to miss out to archrivals @entity115 this time around			0
his quest to win the @entity117 for a third time in his career has also faltered			0
recently , his side were beaten 4 - 3 on aggregate by @entity123 club @entity122 at the semifinal stage			0
@entity3 has made no secret of his desire to return to @entity127 with media reports claiming he has already negotiated a return to @entity26 at the end of the season			1
his previous spell in charge saw him lead the club to their first top flight title for 55 years			0
he won five trophies in his three seasons in @entity29			0
only last week he said , " i know i am loved by some clubs , especially one , " which was widely regarded as confirmation of his desire to once again coach at @entity141			0
on tuesday @entity26 's current manager , @entity143 , confirmed he would be leaving at the end of the season and added : " the next year there will be another manager			1
i think everybody knows who will be here			0
" @entity3 , who has a contract at @entity4 until 2016 , revealed he 's considered remaining at @entity4 and refuted claims that is to do with a dispute over his severance package			1
reports in @entity22 and the @entity155 claim whoever breaks their agreement will owe the other party $ 26 million			0
" i 've considered staying			0
the fans think what you , the press , sell them , " he said			0
" to make things clear i 'll tell you that i 'll be paid until my last working day here			0
i do n't want even one euro more the day i decide that i 'm not going to continue			0
