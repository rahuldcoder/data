another criticized the liveability of the homes within , calling the project a " giant stack of trailer homes			0
" but the building would appear to herald a new age in @entity4 construction , one in which tall , fast builds become common			1
it 's already difficult to keep track of @entity4 's tallest building announcements			1
@entity4 's race for the sky other projects under construction in @entity4 include : @entity40 , @entity41 ( 632 meters , completion in 2014 ) @entity43 , @entity44 ( 597 meters , completion in 2015 ) @entity46 , @entity47 ( 660 meters , completion in 2016 ) @entity49 , @entity50 ( 636 meters , completion in 2017 ) @entity52 , @entity53 ( 700 meters , yet to be confirmed ) more than 10 cities in @entity4 are planning to build something taller than the 541 - meter ( 1,775 feet ) @entity56 , the @entity57 ' tallest building due to open early 2014 in @entity58 , according to the " 2012 @entity59 " by @entity4 architecture website motiancity.com			1
the site , which defines " skyscrapers " as buildings taller than 152 meters ( 498 feet ) , also reports that @entity4 currently has 470 skyscrapers , 332 under construction and 516 planned but unconfirmed			1

the tower will house more than 30,000 people alongside a shopping mall , school , hospital , office areas , roof garden , amusement park , sports facilities , organic farm and a 10 - kilometer " walking street " that will run from the first to the 170th floor			1
" residents do n't need to step out of the building , they can do everything within it , " said @entity75			0
safety concerns some are worried the building could be vulnerable to safety hazards , due to the unconventional construction technique devised by @entity13			0
that " fast - building technology " allowed the group to put up a 30 - story tower in 15 days in 2011 , and a 15 - story hotel within six days a year earlier			2
video : see a hotel built in six days @entity112 , head of @entity113 , told @entity114 , @entity4 's government - sanctioned media body , that @entity5 would be " either a marvel or a hoax			1
" according to @entity112 , @entity13 's @entity5 is an experiment , he claims , that still needs a practical test			2
@entity120 , an architect from @entity121 , expressed concerns to @entity114 about subsidence when the building gets higher			0
@entity13 emphasized that relevant authorities have approved the building as safe			0
super-fast construction method the construction technique is simple , according to the company			0
some 20,000 workers in @entity132 's offsite factory produce thousands of prefabricated steel - and - concrete blocks , 60 square meters in size , over four months			0
these blocks are transported to the location , hoisted and packed into position to make up the final structure over two months , at a rate of three stories a day			0
another four months are needed to complete the internal construction			0
@entity13 has applied this method to more than 30 of their buildings			0
there remains a certain amount of skepticism about the feasibility of the project from @entity4 public and experts			2
