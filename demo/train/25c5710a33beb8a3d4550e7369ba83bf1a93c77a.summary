@entity0 , @entity1 -- a huge wildfire in eastern @entity1 grew wednesday , prompting the @entity5 sheriff 's office to order the full evacuations of two towns , home to about 8,000 people			1
residents of @entity0 and @entity12 received the order late wednesday afternoon , officials said			1
other communities were warned they could be next			1
" we had a lot of spot fires today , " said @entity15 , public information officer for the @entity16			1
hot and dry conditions , with winds out of the southwest , continued to make firefighting efforts difficult , @entity15 told @entity2			1
while firefighters battled the fast - moving blaze , residents in its path faced serious choices : whether to stay -- and what to take with them if they leave			1
" we 're going to get out of here because they want us out of here			2
that 's the main reason , " said @entity0 resident @entity34			2
" we do n't want to go			2
" authorities have evacuated thousands of people since the wildfire , known as the @entity39 , began sweeping through the @entity40 late last month			1
it had burned about 389,000 acres by wednesday			1
officials wednesday said they feared flying embers could cause the fire to spread , and expanded evacuations			1
the fire was moving around the city @entity48 , subject of a monday evacuation			1
it also was threatening @entity51 , where residents have felt the effects of smoke and ash			2
a firefighting team will operate out of @entity57 , @entity51 , about 20 miles east of the border , @entity15 said			2
on wednesday , the front of the fire was just three miles away from the @entity34 family 's @entity62 home			1
@entity34 and his son , @entity64 , loaded what they could into a pair of pickup trucks			2
" we packed up a bunch , we 're just hoping it ai n't going to burn , hoping and praying , " @entity69 said			2
but not everything fit , forcing them to make tough decisions			2
the @entity76 made the cut , but family photos stayed behind			0
their 18 - year - old dog , @entity81 , got a seat in the cab of the truck , but the family cat remained at home			0
firefighters are focusing on saving homes in @entity0 and nearby @entity12			0
but @entity34 said he was n't ready to take any chances			0
as smoke filled their neighborhood , the @entity90 hit the road , hoping they would have a home to return to once the fire passes			1
" i 've seen them wildfires in @entity97 just rip through places , so that 's what i worry about , " @entity34 said			0
next - door neighbor @entity102 , speaking before the evacuation order , said he was determined to stay , and was putting his faith in the roughly 2,500 firefighters who are battling the blaze			0
earlier this week , @entity102 -- a butcher at a local supermarket -- prepared 2,000 pounds of hamburger to feed fire crews			1
" we have so many firefighters here that are so into their jobs and the have protected other small communities that i know they are going to do a good job protecting @entity0 , " he said			0
the driveway of @entity102 's home is lined with white stones , each a souvenir of a trip his father and stepmother took to the nearby @entity124 over 17 years			0
fire has already engulfed most of the mountains where they vacationed , but the stones are reminders of good times , he said			1
" my dad built this place , and he 's gone now , and i love this area so much			0
i 've lived all over the country , and this is it			0
this is where i 'm at , " he said			0
even so , he said he 'll join the steady stream of residents heading for safer ground if conditions get worse			0
" i 'm not a dummy			0
when the wind shifts when the ash starts to get heavy , when the smoke changes , it 's time to go , " he said			0
@entity2 's @entity147 and @entity148 contributed to this report .			0
