@entity0 -- in october 1991 , i came to @entity3 with my wife , my 6 - year - old son and my mother - in - law			1
last month , we celebrated the 20th anniversary of our life in this country			1
i remember the journey from what was then the @entity13 vividly			1
being driven to @entity14 in @entity15 , the long goodbyes with my family and friends			1
i remember the faces of my crying mother , my puzzled father			2
they were afraid of what would happen to their son and their grandson in a strange land			1
as we were leaving , i had to brace myself for the possibility that i would not see my family again			1
after all , the @entity31 , although rusty and crumbling , was still around			2
the unknown lay ahead , and it was scary			2
thirty - three years in the @entity13 were over			1
i felt like our lives were about to start anew			2
for us , life in @entity15 was actually not bad at all			1
@entity37 and numerous friends always compensated for living behind the @entity31 and numerous day - to - day shortcomings			1
my generation grew up in a culture of near - deprivation , constant shortages of everything imaginable			2
but that was nothing compared with the lives of my parents and especially my grandparents '			2
i recall how people used to stock up on everything			2
everyone 's refrigerators were actually packed with food			2
and , as i said , we made it through with the support of friends and family			1
but since my early childhood , i had heard about the " zapad " -- the @entity61 , in @entity62			0
and the older i grew , the more attractive @entity63 seemed			0
i can still visualize my grandfather opening a package from his brother , who lived in @entity67			0
unheard - of luxuries : @entity70 pens and @entity72 razors wrapped in glitzy plastic			0
we were asked to get off the plane for the layover at @entity77			0
sunny skies , fall colors , very warm compared with slushy @entity15			0
that 's how i remember our arrival in @entity3			0
at @entity82 , we were told to follow the line for new immigrants			0
we then stayed with my friend 's parents in @entity87			0
we experienced hospitality and goodwill like we never had before			0
my friend 's parents gave our family of four shelter and fed us for nearly two months			2
once , they had been new immigrants , too			0
when we came to @entity0 , we were surprised			0
everyone was driving cars , and there were no sidewalks to walk on			0
once , when we walked on a street looking for an apartment to rent , a friend from @entity1 pulled up and offered us a ride			1
he ended up driving us around for the rest of the day			2
a lot has changed since then			0
i have been working for @entity1 since 1992			1
my son is a young man who lives in @entity67 , where he works in book publishing			1
my wife is an it specialist whose long working hours are hard to be envious of			0
last year , i was diagnosed with a brain tumor			1
i had to undergo surgery and have been monitored and given treatment since			1
but , for now at least , i like to consider myself healthy			0
i am in good physical shape , and i continue to work full time at @entity1			1
i see friends and enjoy a bottle of fine wine			0
i rejoice when i listen to music in my car			0
my illness taught me to appreciate life			1
i feel grateful every day : for a beautiful day , for what i have			1
that 's why @entity122 is so meaningful to me			0
in a way , i feel like every day is @entity122			1
but on @entity125 , the last thursday in november , everyone in @entity3 feels the same way -- i hope			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity129 .			1

i have worked for @entity1 since 1992 , and my son is now a young man , he says
