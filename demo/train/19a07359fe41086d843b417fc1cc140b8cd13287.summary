on the first pastoral visit of his papacy , @entity0 shunned protocol and politics on a visit to the tiny island of @entity7 off the coast of @entity9 to pray for refugees and migrants lost at sea			1
@entity0 used the visit to criticize what he called " global indifference " to the refugee crisis , saying : " today no one in the world feels responsible for this ; we have lost the sense of fraternal responsibility ; we have fallen into the hypocritical attitude of the priest and of the servant of the altar that @entity27 speaks about in the parable of the @entity29 , " he said			1
" we look upon the brother half dead by the roadside , perhaps we think ' poor guy , ' and we continue on our way , it 's none of our business ; and we feel fine with this			0
@entity7 is just 113 kilometers from @entity37 and has been the first point of entry to @entity40 for more than 200,000 refugees and irregular migrants who have passed through the island since 1999 ( @entity45 stat )			1
the @entity47 coastguard had just rescued a crippled ship with 165 @entity49 on board just hours before the pope 's arrival			2
the pontiff flew to @entity7 from @entity54 on monday morning and immediately boarded a port authority cutter that has been involved in the rescue of more than 30,000 refugees in recent years , according to the @entity47 @entity58			1
more than 120 fishermen from @entity7 escorted this vessel to the island 's main port			1
outside the port , the pope paused to pray at the sight of a deadly 2011 shipwreck before launching a wreath of flowers into the water to commemorate the lives of those lost at sea " in search of a better life			2
" there were also tourist boats , yachts and people on jet skis waving yellow papal flags to greet the pontiff			0
" with one short visit , the pope is drawing attention to three main issues ; the plight of poor immigrants , problem of human trafficking , the growing gap between rich and poor in the world , " said the @entity87 's media advisor @entity85 ahead of the visit			1
" @entity0 is showing that when in @entity97 faith says ' love your neighbor , ' they just do n't mean the person next door			1
this tiny island shows the incredible contrast between the global north and south , between the ' haves ' of the world and the ' have nots			1
' it is a great lesson in true charity , many of the immigrants are not even @entity112			0
" on arriving in the port , the pope then met 50 selected migrants including men , women and children who were both @entity97 and @entity119 and listened to their stories about their perilous voyage from @entity122			2
he was then driven in a makeshift popemobile -- a white open - top @entity125 jeep on loan from a @entity128 family who have a summer house on the island			0
he was driven through crowds and past a boat graveyard where the hulls of hundreds of migrant boats are stacked alongside piles of foam mattresses and discarded clothing from the boats			0
the pope then held a mass for 15,000 people under blazing sun at an outdoor sporting center on the island			2
standing at an altar made of the wooden remnants of refugee boats and dressed in purple robes normally reserved for lent and mourning , @entity0 gave an emotional homily focused on " global indifference " to the refugee and irregular migrant problem			1
pope @entity0 made his decision to visit @entity7 after hearing about the deaths of refugees whose boat capsized off the coast of @entity9 in late june			1
several of the refugees clung to the fishing nets of a @entity37 - flagged vessel before the fishermen cut the nets loose , sending at least 10 people to their death			0
many of the bodies were never recovered			0
" when , a few weeks ago , i heard the news -- which unfortunately has been repeated so many times -- the thought always returns as a thorn in the heart that brings suffering , " @entity0 said			2
" and then i felt that i ought to come here today to pray , to make a gesture of closeness , but also to reawaken our consciences so that what happened would not be repeated			0
" @entity0 then thanked the people of @entity7 along with the rescue workers , ngos and volunteers who man the centers on the island where refugees are taken			1
he acknowledged the @entity119 immigrants who recently arrived on the island and who are beginning to fast for @entity188 , wishing them " best wishes for abundant spiritual fruits			0
" but he lashed those who ignored the plight of refugees			0
" the culture of well - being , that makes us think of ourselves , that makes us insensitive to the cries of others , that makes us live in soap bubbles , that are beautiful but are nothing , are illusions of futility , of the transient , that brings indifference to others , that brings even the globalization of indifference , " he said			0
the pope 's words were not likely meant for the people of @entity7 , who open their hearts and homes to the hoards of refugees who land on their shores each year , but rather to the greater @entity221 which has struggled with what to do with the influx of migrants and refugees in recent years			1
@entity47 and @entity226 have long pushed for a comprehensive @entity221 immigration policy to help absorb the influx but @entity229 and @entity230 have resisted implementing such a plan , calling on the southern nations to do a better job patrolling their borders			0
so far in 2013 , more than 8,400 refugees and migrants have landed in @entity47 and nearby @entity226 in search of economic improvement and political asylum , according to the @entity241 high commissioner for refugees			0
many have been deported back to their countries of origin while others have been given political asylum and are then free to travel through @entity40 's open - border countries .			2
