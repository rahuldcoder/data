" it was foreseeable that the tweets would cause @entity6 and @entity7 to have to flee their house in the middle of the night and never to be able to return , have to face a descent of media and others who would seek to do harm to @entity6 and @entity7 and to their home , and have to live in seclusion to protect their personal and emotional well being , " the civil complaint said			1

the tweet was published a month after their son killed 17 - year - old @entity48 in a @entity16 subdivision , when national attention was focused on the incident and amid calls for @entity2 's arrest			1
a @entity16 jury acquitted @entity2 of second - degree murder and manslaughter charges in the shooting of the unarmed teenager in a highly - publicized 2013 trial			0
the tweet listed his parents ' names , telephone number and home address , even though they were " in no way involved in any of the incidents occurring on february 26 , 2012 , " the lawsuit said			1
the complaint said @entity3 later tweeted : " at first i thought it was good to let ppl know that no one can hide anymore ... if @entity2 is n't arrested i 'll rt his address again - maybe go 2 his house myself			1
" @entity3 violated @entity40 's rules banning tweets with unauthorized personal information , the lawsuit said			0
" @entity3 acted extremely and outrageously in making the tweets which were intended to cause severe emotional distress to @entity6 and @entity7 and possible great physical harm , if not death , " the lawsuit contends			2
the @entity34 " suffered emotional pain and suffering , mental anguish , loss of the capacity for the enjoyment of life , incurred additional living expenses due to the inability to live in their home and have suffered a loss in value of their home , " the complaint said			2
