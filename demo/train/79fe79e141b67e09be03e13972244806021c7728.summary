@entity0 -- @entity2 , the soccer player who collapsed during a game saturday , may never return to professional football , according to a @entity0 heart specialist			1
in an interview with @entity1 affiliate @entity7 , consultant cardiologist dr. @entity8 , from @entity9 , said it was " very much in doubt " that he could resume his professional career			1
the 23 - year - old @entity14 player , originally from the @entity15 , is currently in a critical condition at the @entity17 after collapsing during a match with @entity19			2
players pray for recovery dr. @entity8 said the treatment he received on the pitch was crucial to his survival , and his chances of making a recovery better than someone who collapses in the street due to the medical facilities at the stadium			1
" it 's almost the ideal place because of course @entity35 players are well looked after so he goes in with very good health and top of that he 's being actively watched during the game , " he said			0
" the paramedics arrived immediately , the resuscitation attempt started immediately and the defibrillator -- which is the life - saving maneuver -- happened within a couple of minutes			2
within the first three minutes if you can get the heart restarted , then you 've got a good chance of survival			1
" the specialist who works at one of @entity0 's heart attack centers said there would now be concern about whether the young footballer had suffered brain damage			1
" it may be that because he 's young and fit he 'll make a great recovery but the question is more about his brain than his heart			2
i think his heart will recover quickly from this , but has there been enough bloody supply going to his brain during the time of his cardiac arrest to make sure he 's neurologically intact ? " we want to see that he wakes up and starts communicating -- that 's the next step			0
" dr. @entity8 believes the cardiac arrest was probably caused by an existing condition			1
" despite all of the screening , there is still an instance of about two in 100,000 of this sort of thing occurring			0
it 's much rarer than in the general population because these are fit young guys , but you can not pick up the subtle abnormalities			0
" he said the next 48 hours would be crucial			0
" i 'm more worried about [ whether ] he is going to wake up and be the person he was before			0
