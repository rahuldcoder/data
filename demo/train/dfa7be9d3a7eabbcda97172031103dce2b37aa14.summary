-- in the fall of 1995 , i jumped into a large van with about 20 other young black men , and we headed out from the small college town of @entity7 , @entity8 , to @entity9			1
the mission : addressing the ills crippling black men			1
we were an intellectually curious and rambunctious group			0
loud , idealistic gen @entity15 , raised on the sweet nectar of @entity18 's message of personal responsibility and the films of @entity21 that encouraged us to fight the power			2
so convinced that this event was going to change the world that when we turned on the radio , and @entity28 's " @entity29 " came on , i took the song as providence			1
nearly 20 years later and i 'm sure i do n't need to rattle off all of the discouraging statistics regarding men of color in this country to illustrate that moment was anything but the awakening it was designed to be			0
yet i sat thursday in the @entity39 of the @entity40 -- listening to president @entity41 as he announced his " @entity43 " initiative , looking at the young men who stood on risers behind him , listening to the affirmative audibles of the attendants , like the congregation of a @entity50 -- and i found myself fondly reminiscing			1
when i first came to @entity9 to address the unique circumstances hindering men of color , it was with a megaphone shouting at the @entity40			2
on this day , i was in the @entity40 , and the megaphone had been replaced with a microphone clipped to a podium that bears the seal of the president			2
afterward i was asked if i thought this initiative would make a difference			1
true , the cynic will look at the laundry list of already created programs -- locally and nationally -- that were designed to dismantle the debilitating factors that have plagued men of color over the years , look at " keeper " and shrug			0
others will accuse @entity41 of promoting division by using the office to highlight the issues of minorities over those of their white counterparts			1
as if one in three black males being projected to go to prison at some point in their lives can be construed as some sort of highlight			1
but such is the world of the first black president of these @entity87			1
@entity41 spent the first five years of his administration cautiously touching on the issue of race -- a beer summit here , a hypothetical " son " in the wake of the killing of @entity95 there -- likely for fear of being perceived as only caring about the needs of " his people " as opposed to " the people			1
" as a result , he has been the target of sharp criticism from some within the black community who see him aggressively addressing the pain of the lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender community , or tackling issues such as immigration that greatly affect @entity115 , and they wonder what about us ? what about our pain ? the wealth of black households has declined more than any other demographic during @entity41 's time as president and those hurt most by this wonder : what about us ? blood continues to flow and bullets fly in the neighborhood streets he calls home and the residents wonder , what ... about ... us ? thursday he said , i hear you			1
i was asked if that would make a difference			1
@entity41 's address was not about government			1
his community , which is my community , which is your community			2
for as much as the narrative has historically reflected a storyline framed around the troubles of one section of society , the reality is no section is immune economically from the effects of this crisis			1
men of color are more prone to drop out of high school than anyone else			2
a majority of inmates lack a high school diploma			2
in a 21 - year span ending in 2003 , the amount of money spent on prisons increased by 570 %			0
that money comes from taxes			0
not to mention the loss of workers and the well - documented effects of unplanned pregnancies coupled with absentee fathers			0
and when news reports of young men dying from gang violence no longer elicit an emotional response -- a sad reality the president talked about -- we are indeed in a moral crisis			1
will " keeper " make a difference ?			1
whether @entity41 is freed from the need to appease now that he 's in his second term or driven by the urgency of the moment , the forming of " @entity43 " is the most tangible manifestation of his " change we can believe in " slogan in years			1
and while $ 200 million promised by various corporations and philanthropic groups is but a " drop in the bucket " in terms of the resources needed -- as one of his critics , @entity198 , pointed out soon thereafter -- the fact he was able to raise that amount quietly is an indication that addressing this crisis has been on his mind for some time			2
even if he was hesitant to talk about it			0
@entity205 , a local student involved in an education supplemental program called @entity207 , was one of those young men standing on the risers behind the president			2
he spoke to me about what it was like to spend time with @entity41 and how he has already been encouraged by what the president wants to do			1
" people are always trying to bring your self - esteem down , " the 16 - year - old from @entity9 told me			0
" i have neighbors and kids in school telling me that i wo n't turn out to be anything and stuff like that			0
" some parts of my neighborhood are good and some parts people are doing drugs and stuff like that			0
but i try not to pay any attention to them and stay focused on my goals			0
" goals that include going to college and becoming a chemical engineer			0
over the past two days , he has gotten to know @entity240 , a 15 - year - old at his school			0
while @entity205 has two parents in the home , @entity240 said he is raised by his mother and gets support from his aunts and cousins who help him stay out of trouble			0
" getting to know @entity205 has been a great experience because he has goals like i do , " @entity240 said			0
" i did n't know him before , but now that i have , we 've become good friends			0
i know i will do all i can to encourage him and help him because seeing him do well will inspire me to do well			0
" @entity240 , who wants to attend @entity255 and major in computer science , is his brother 's keeper			0
and so if you saw the president 's address or read some of his remarks and wonder if it would make a difference ... first think of @entity205 and @entity240 and invariably your answer will be yes			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity267 .			2

@entity267 : will president @entity41 's " @entity43 " initiative make a difference ?
he says it will address *dangers* of dropping out of school , getting in trouble with the *law*
the problems of young black males affect all of society economically , @entity267 says
he says @entity41 returns to " change " theme by addressing his community 's issues
