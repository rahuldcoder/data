@entity0 -- the @entity2 on sunday accused @entity3 of trying to overthrow the government of the former @entity6 republic of @entity7 , where @entity3 troops have been battling @entity7 forces over the breakaway territory of @entity11			1
@entity12 , @entity2 ambassador to the @entity0 , alleges a @entity3 official said @entity7 's president " must go			1
" at an emergency session of the @entity0 ' @entity16 , the @entity2 alleged @entity3 foreign minister @entity17 told @entity2 secretary of state @entity18 that @entity7 president @entity19 " must go			1
" " this is completely unacceptable and crosses a line , " said the @entity2 ambassador to the @entity0 , @entity12 , who made the allegation			1
in a crackling exchange of a type rarely seen since the end of the @entity28 , @entity12 asked @entity3 ambassador @entity29 whether the @entity3 were seeking " regime change " in @entity7 with the military operation they launched friday			1
in response , @entity29 objected to the disclosure of a confidential phone call between top diplomats and said " regime change " was " an @entity2 expression			1
" the term was one the @entity40 administration used to describe its goals in the 2003 invasion of @entity43 , which @entity3 opposed			2
but @entity29 said some leaders " become an obstacle " to their own people , and " some situations take courageous decisions with regard to the political future			0
" " sometimes there are democratically elected or semi-democratically elected leaders who do things which create grave problems for their countries , " @entity29 told reporters after the meeting			0
" so sometimes , those leaders should contemplate how useful they have become to their people			0
" the pro-western @entity19 came to power in @entity7 's " @entity61 " in 2003 and was elected president in 2004 and 2008			1
his government has strong @entity2 backing , has contributed troops to the @entity2 - led war in @entity43 and applied for membership in @entity68			2
@entity7 's ambassador , @entity69 , said @entity29 's meaning was clear enough			2
" for me , it confirms that what the @entity3 is seeking through this military aggression and invasion is to change the democratically elected @entity7 government , " @entity69 said			1
@entity12 said the @entity2 plans to offer a draft resolution calling for an immediate cease - fire in @entity7 , accusing @entity3 forces of impeding the withdrawal of @entity7 troops from the territory			1
though @entity3 could veto the measure in the @entity16 , he said @entity88 " is on the wrong side here " and risked damaging its ties with @entity84 and the @entity85			2
" the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in @entity91 -- those days are gone , " @entity12 said			0
the situation in @entity11 escalated rapidly from thursday night , when @entity7 said it launched an operation into the region after artillery fire from separatists killed 10 people			2
it accused @entity3 of backing the separatists			0
@entity3 sent tanks to @entity11 on friday , saying it wanted to protect its peacekeepers posted there following cease - fires in years past			0
by sunday the conflict was raging in other parts of @entity7 as well , including another breakaway area , @entity106 , located in northwestern @entity7			0
each side accused the other of killing large numbers of civilians			0
@entity3 said at least 2,000 people have been killed in @entity11 's capital , @entity113			0
@entity29 repeated @entity3 's position that it is responding to thursday 's @entity7 attack on @entity11 , which , although inside @entity7 , has an autonomous government that is backed by @entity88			1
@entity29 said @entity3 's military action is a humanitarian campaign aimed at blocking the " ethnic cleansing " of @entity120 by ethnic @entity7			1
he also challenged @entity12 's argument that @entity3 forces were waging a " campaign of terror " there , essentially telling council members to consider the source			0
" this statement , ambassador , is absolutely unacceptable -- particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of , including with regard to civilian populations in @entity43 and @entity136 and @entity137 , " @entity29 said			0
but @entity29 drew a rebuke from other @entity16 members , including its current president , after he questioned the objectivity of a top @entity0 official who briefed ambassadors on the conflict in @entity7			1
the @entity16 's president , @entity146 's @entity145 , said he was " surprised and dismayed " by @entity29 's swipe at @entity148 , the @entity0 undersecretary for political affairs			2
@entity29 said @entity148 's briefing , which included a statement from @entity156 ban ki - moon , " shows that the @entity150 and its leadership was not able to adopt that objective position that is required by the substance of this conflict			0
" @entity1 's @entity157 and @entity158 contributed to this report .			0
