-- in parts of @entity3 , he is regarded as sailing 's answer to @entity6 , but @entity7 is just happy to be alive rather than fretting about his potential celebrity status			1
eight years ago @entity7 was quietly lying in the bunk of his yacht in the early hours of a thursday morning listening to his @entity11 when his near - death experience began			1
in the heart of the @entity17 , 1,000 miles from the nearest land , @entity15 , his boat suddenly pitched completely to its side			2
with his keel broken , @entity7 began his battle to stay alive			1
" things go through your mind like ' is this it ? ' " he recalls of what remains the biggest low of his career during the @entity24 in 2006			2
" but then survival kicks in			2
what else are you going to do ? everyone else says ' that 's amazing ' but you do n't have a choice			2
no one else is going to help you			2
" except someone did come to his aid -- his sailing nemesis @entity40 , with whom @entity7 had spectacularly fallen out with on the eve of the race			1
@entity7 had opted not to finish the prologue race while leading -- superstitiously believing that to do so would scupper his chances of overall victory			1
no prologue winner had ever won the race			2
it meant that @entity40 , who was also planning a similar strategy , took the win -- and was left fuming			1
" he felt that i 'd stitched him up on purpose , " says @entity7			1
" words were said , a slanging match ensued and he called me a ' jumped - up little pr * * k. ' " despite the pair 's spat , @entity40 gave up his own race ambitions -- he was second at the time -- to rescue a sailor in need			1
it took @entity40 a further 10 hours to reach @entity7 , before the pair opted -- in the sleet and snow -- to undertake the rescue at first light			1
wearing his survival suit , @entity69 jumped ship into his life raft amid a 15 - foot swell approaching the eye of a storm			1
three times , @entity40 tried to undertake the high speed and treacherous rescue			1
only to fail three times			0
during the fourth attempt , which was ultimately successful , @entity7 broke his arm as he held on to some webbing			1
" i remember an albatross sat in the water next to me in the life raft as i left myself go from the boat , " says @entity7			1
" the albatross felt like a mascot -- it gave me a warm feeling			0
@entity40 felt all the responsibility on him and he saw it differently -- he felt like it was a vulture to him			1
" the pair hugged before collapsing , both exhausted on the deck before @entity7 went into shock			1
@entity40 dressed his wounds and the pair had a cup of coffee before a 40 - knot icy gust hit the boat resulting in the mast on @entity40 's yacht breaking			1
" i remember saying ' i 'm so sorry ' and he stood over me and said ' do you know what the moral of the story is ? ' and i thought he was going to punch me			0
' do n't come first or second in the prologue ! ' " the pair worked tirelessly together for eight days to sail into @entity109 -- a city where @entity40 had married his wife -- and from that moment onwards understandably become the best of friends			1
the eight - year anniversary of their rescue has just passed but @entity69 has not been put off by the perils of the high seas			1
when most people will be preparing to pop champagne corks on @entity121 , he will set off on his next quest , the @entity123 , a two - man non-stop circumnavigation of the globe with @entity128 sailor @entity127			1
@entity69 is far more welcoming than the @entity130 seas on the day we meet			1
boarding is done on the move from a rib ( small speedboat ) and seconds after the usual greeting niceties , i 'm put in the driving seat			0
sailing such a boat at a 35 - degree angle as it creaks noisily underneath is unnerving , the steering column responsive to the slightest push from the curved blue seat from which @entity7 dictates his myriad voyages			1
the bearded @entity69 is not tall but oozes a physicality that makes you realize he is well equipped to take whatever the sea throws at him			2
one minute he is cracking a joke or recalling a past sailing anecdote , the next deadly serious barking instructions to his team on board			2
for the most part , though , @entity7 likes to be alone , his long term goal a return to solo sailing in the 2016 @entity157			1
at the back of his mind when he sets out on that particular venture , he does so knowing he may never come back again			0
" the emotion is horrendous , " he says looking back to the start of the last @entity157 when he finished third			0
" your family and friends are there , in fact 500,000 people are there at the start			0
they come to watch the start as they know that maybe you wo n't come back again			0
" his long - term mentor sir @entity173 , who is also a key figure in @entity178 's @entity177 venture , reportedly told @entity7 , " i 've been to @entity179 , @entity181 finals and i 've never experienced anything like this			1
" in the @entity184 region of @entity3 , @entity7 says he is held up on a pedestal , given superstar status like @entity6			1
locals will give him free drinks and meals , while the short walk on the harbor to his boat will see him stop to sign autographs for scores of fans			0
back at home , the married father of two becomes invisible among the public			0
" no one pays attention to me and i like that , although it 's nice to be a superstar for a week or two			0
" the @entity184 is a race that no @entity205 has ever won before and @entity7 is determined to be the first but he knows that trip and his upcoming one from @entity123 are hard to take for his family			1
" my wife [ @entity209 ] worries every day and not just her but the team as they are a family , " he says			0
" sometimes you forget to call or you say ' sorry , got to go ' as you need to ease the main sheet or whatever and then you forget to ring back			0
" they 'll be tearing their hair out as they 're not in control of the situation			0
" but the sailing , and in particular the solo sailing , is a drug that he can not give up , and something he says he would even do for free such is his obsession with the sport			2
" if you 're performing well , it 's great			0
it 's like every day winning the 100 meters as you always feel like you 're performing			0
" if you 're not doing well it 's like hell on earth			0
i 've had both ends of the spectrum and i just love that performing end			2
" @entity69 has gained notoriety for two sailing stunts , one in which he stood on the keel of his boat as it was titled to the side in race mode before jumping off , the other seeing him hurtle up the mast before diving into the ocean -- both times bedecked in a designer suit			1
conscious of the risks involved of stunts and voyages alike , @entity69 uses sports psychologist @entity253 to talk him through the emotions he is experiencing			2
" i use @entity253 if i 've got a challenge that needs overcoming , " he says			0
" when you 're on deck , it 's pretty scary but when you go inside your brain is screaming at you ' you 're going to die			0
' " so to be able to go to sleep when your body 's pumping adrenalin into it and keeping you alive is really quite hard			0
" the psychologist has taught @entity69 visualization exercises to keep his demons at bay			2
" i visualize being above the boat but not in the clouds , outside it			0
i can look down at the boat , i can see it 's windy , the waves are big but it 's not too bad			0
" i can see there are no icebergs , containers , whales			0
that allows me to calm down a bit but you have to work out what it is , how to address it and it takes months being able to deal with that			0
" whatever the formula , it is clearly working			0
@entity7 remains in a select band of about 100 people to have circumnavigated solo around the globe			2
now he wants to be the quickest .			0
