" it 's already something special to have the @entity9 in our group			1

" @entity13 coach @entity54 revealed he predicted his side would be paired with the @entity10			1
his team is aiming to become the first @entity58 side to win the tournament in @entity60			2
but it will face a tough opening game against the @entity63 on june 13 in @entity64			2
" i said this morning we were going to get @entity10 and we did , in the first game no less , " @entity54 told @entity66 tv			1
" @entity10 have changed a little bit , especially in the middle of the park , but they still have ( @entity73 ) @entity72 , ( @entity75 ) @entity74 , ( @entity76 ) @entity77 and ( @entity79 ) @entity78			1
" i think it is good for our mentality that we have to prepare from the first day			2
@entity10 will demand that we start at our highest level			1
" everything depends not just on our opponents , but on ourselves and the way we mentally approach this competition			2

" our great advantage is being based in rio - meaning that we 've only got that one really long trip			0
" i 'm very positive , you just never know			0
you do n't win football matches on paper , you go out on each occasion 11 vs. 11			0
if you 're well prepared you 've got a chance to win all three of the games			0
" while @entity109 might be positive , @entity131 chairman @entity130 was rather more downbeat			0

" @entity158 is one of the best to have ever played football , " he said			0
" he can do everything except head the ball			0
the question is how do you stop him ? " you ca n't really if he 's on a good day			0
what we need to worry about is @entity158 going to be healthy come 2014 ? if he is healthy , we have a problem			0
but we have nothing to fear -- for the first time in a long time we feel we have nothing to lose			0
