@entity0 , @entity1 -- seen from the perspective of 2012 , the stunning @entity4 revival of " @entity5 " offers a powerful reminder that economic policy and family values go hand - in - hand			1
although many current politicians like to separate these two issues , the economic foundation of the family is central to its long - term health			1
in this classic play by @entity18 , premiered in 1949 to mesmerized audiences that had lived through the @entity21 , the protagonist is salesman @entity22 , who is mentally broken down from his constant travel and struggle to make ends meet			2
" a small man can be just as exhausted as a great man , " says @entity22 's wife , @entity25			2
@entity22 's son @entity28 is unable to find a job and fulfill his father 's hopes			0
@entity28 and his brother , @entity32 , are worried about their father 's mental health , which is rapidly deteriorating			0
when @entity22 tries to find a job where he can stay in town to take better care of himself and his family , he ends up losing his job			1
the story disintegrates from there , culminating with @entity22 tragically committing suicide with the hope that @entity28 will use the life insurance money to start his own business			1
too often , politicians ignore the kinds of strains that economic problems cause for families			1
as the historian @entity54 argued in an essay in " @entity56 , " a book i co-edited , the rhetoric about family values is rooted in conservative politics in the 1970s when political activists on the right and popular culture blamed sexuality and feminism , rather than unemployment and inflation , for problems at home			1
the rhetoric from the 1970s has stuck			0
many conservative @entity70 such as former @entity72 sen. @entity71 still define " family values " as having to do with matters of popular culture , abortion or sexuality			1
when the @entity70 primaries were still being actively contested , it was common to hear pundits argue that @entity80 represented the " economic conservative " in the contest and @entity71 was the champion of " family values			1
" indeed @entity70 often attack @entity83 as having little interest in family values while many @entity83 shy away from too much talk about the family for fear of looking as if they are trying to appease the right			1
but as @entity22 's story makes clear , family values are as much about economics as culture			1
today , we 're living with economic problems that have a direct correlation on our ability to nurture strong families			1
the first and most obvious is job growth			0
the current sluggish recovery has left more than 8 % of the work force without jobs , and millions of other @entity72 feeling that their futures are not secure			0
when the men and women who run households do n't feel that their jobs are stable , or they do n't have jobs , tensions quickly mount over basic issues such as paying the rent or mortgage and buying food			0
according to a @entity114 poll in 2011 , 67 % of @entity72 said that the economy was causing strains on their family			1
the second economic source of instability comes from taking care of the old			0
many @entity72 are struggling to deal with the generational squeeze of taking care of their younger children while helping their elderly parents as well			0
these pressures are greatly affected by the health of @entity126 and @entity127 , two programs that play a vital role for middle - class families			1
while these policies are often discussed as programs for the " elderly , " they have always been conceived as programs to help working families by providing them some relief from the basic costs faced by older members of their families			1
in coming years , there will be a very big debate over the costs of these programs and the need for reform			1
it will be essential that policymakers in both parties do what is necessary to protect and strengthen the programs			2
the third source of economic strain on the family comes from health care			2
health insurance premiums and out - of - pocket costs have been a continually rising burden on family income that few people talk about			2
if president @entity163 's health care reform stands , then it will be essential that policymakers figure out how to make it successful			0
@entity166 will be the need for the states to set up strong and functional health exchange systems and to make sure that the regulatory provisions in the bill are containing costs			0
if the program is deemed unconstitutional , policymakers in both parties need to go back to the drawing board to figure out how to improve the system			0
finally , there is education			0
families are been run ragged by the challenges of higher education			2
the costs continue to rise even as income stagnates			0
millions of @entity72 feel that the costs of higher education make college degrees impossible to earn			0
in this economy , a college education is vital to economic success			0
public policy most keep the interest rates on student loans at a reasonable level to make sure that families are not crushed by the pressures to finance college costs			2
the federal government must also make sure that states are financially healthy enough to support state colleges and universities			1
americans who are in their 20s and 30s struggling to pay off massive college loans are at a major disadvantage when it comes to setting up their own households			0
this is one area where @entity163 and @entity80 seem to be in agreement , with both parties promising that they wo n't allow the rates on student loans to increase on july 1			0
during the 1930s , president @entity212 always understood that family security could only result from economic security			2
this was a central theme of his presidency			0
as @entity212 said upon signing @entity126 in 1935 : " we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty - ridden old age			2
" but over the past few decades , we 've lost sight of @entity212 's words			0
it 's time to rethink the notion of family values and remember , as the story of @entity22 reminds us , that a strong family starts with a strong economy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			1

@entity238 : too often family values are viewed as separate from economics
he says ' @entity5 ' shows how families can be *undermined* by money woes
some politicians argue that family values are about sexuality and pop culture , @entity238 says
he says government must preserve programs that support families
