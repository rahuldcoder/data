-- at 16 , gymnast @entity1 has already accomplished enough to give her license for a break			1
but the gold - and silver - medalist is n't stopping , even while on the mend from a recent injury			0
@entity1 hurt her left leg after suffering a fall during a stop on @entity11 in september , and she 's been recovering slowly but surely , she recently told @entity0			1
one upside to her time away from the tour , though , is that she was able to squeeze in an appearance on the @entity16 's " @entity15 , " which returns for a second season tuesday			1
yet for @entity1 , it was n't simply a fun opportunity -- it 's part of a larger goal to one day become a working actress			1
" i 've always wanted to be an actress ... ever since i was very little , i really liked being in front of a camera			1
i 've always been drawn to it and i 've always wanted to pursue it , just like gymnastics , " she said			1
" it 's something that you kind of put in your brain and you never let go of			2
" with gymnastics being a sport that retires its athletes at a young age , @entity1 has been putting all of her energy toward her athletic goals while she has youth on her side			1
but " after it 's all said and done with the @entity41 and @entity42 and whatever i get the chance to do , i think that would be my time to really get into acting , something that i want to have as my job when i 'm older , " she said			1
if there was one actor she looks up to and hopes to pattern her career after , the gymnast said , it 'd be @entity54			2
" i really like @entity54 , all the jobs that she 's done , " she said , pointing to @entity54 's turn in the action thriller " @entity56 " as a favorite			2
" i 'm kind of more into movies , because i 'm really into getting into [ character ] and being that person and selling it as well as she always does			0
" " i like comedy , i like romantic stuff			0
i think the movie ' easy a ' is super cute and i love @entity70 , she 's an amazing actress and i love how she does all different sorts of things , and that 's what i 'd like to do			2
i 'm not one kind of person , and that 's the whole thing about being an actress , being able to play all different kind of roles			2
" and so , with help from an agent she acquired a few months before the @entity41 , the 16 - year - old champ has been looking for ways to break into the industry			0
the " @entity15 " guest appearance in an upcoming episode came through said agent , and , given that she was momentarily at home from the tour , she went for it			1
" it was my first time ever doing anything like that , " @entity1 said			2
" gymnastics , you 're in the gym eight hours a day and acting , that 's a full - time job as well			1
so i finally had the time to do it , and i had the best time			0
" the @entity16 show stars @entity102 ( " @entity103 " ) as dr. @entity104 , a city doctor who 's had to adjust to living in small - town @entity105 after accepting a job from a physician who left half his practice to her in his will			1
@entity1 will portray the friend of @entity112 ( @entity111 ) , herself a friend of @entity104 's			1
" @entity104 has this guy that she 's going on a date with , and @entity112 really likes this guy , and there 's a little bit of drama and i 'm kind of backing up @entity112 , " @entity1 explained			1
@entity1 may be green , but she 's without trepidation , saying that learning lines and acting on set felt like it came naturally			1
" i 've done acting classes before , and school plays , and i 've always loved it , " she added			2
" it 's weird , i was watching [ ' @entity15 ' ] the same day that my agent told me that they might want me on the show			1
i really like the character @entity112 on the show ... and i thought if i was ever going to be on the show , i 'd really want to play her , and then i ended up being her best friend			0
so it was really surreal and kind of special			0
" she 's also lined up a guest actor role on " @entity137 " ( as a huge fan , she said , " i kind of always thought that it was @entity140 " who was the elusive " a " ) , which she hopes to shoot at some point in the future			0
" everything that i 'm doing , i love to do			0
i really just take things one step at a time			0
even when things get hard , i just believe that everything happens for a reason , " she said			0
" life goes on , and you have to make the best of everything			0
you really do have to enjoy life , because it 's short			2
" but before fans of her athletic prowess fear @entity1 's cutting her gymnastics career short in favor of @entity163 , rest assured that she 's not done yet			1
" right now , i 'm only 16 , and gymnastics will always be a part of me , " she said of her future plans			0
" i 'm really an athletic person and i do n't think i could let go entirely of the sport			0
i really want to try to go to this next @entity41 , [ and ] after i heal up i 'll be back in the gym working as hard as i possibly could just like i did for this @entity41			0
you ca n't just say that you want to try ... you have to be focused for whatever you do , just like acting			0
so i 'll really be getting into trying to work for the next @entity41 , and in between that i 'll be doing , hopefully , little things like what i just did			0
