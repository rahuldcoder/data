@entity0 , @entity1 -- at the @entity4 in @entity0 , southern @entity1 , tranquil waters lap gently against the shore beneath the ghostly @entity6			1
today , it 's a pretty and peaceful scene , but one that belies the port 's bustling colonial past			2
it was at this spot just over a century ago that the ancestors of @entity1 's successful @entity15 community first set foot on @entity18 soil			1
they came in ships and dhows , having been coaxed here to build one of the continent 's great railways			1
as that railway -- which was soon christened the " lunatic line " because of its high cost and the dangers faced by those constructing it -- snaked through the country towards @entity32 in the years that followed , so did the @entity15 community			1
the economic and cultural roots they laid down beside the tracks remains to this day			0
" ( my family is involved ) in quite a lot , " said one businesswoman of @entity15 heritage we meet in a nearby restaurant			1
" we have commodities , transport and various other things			0
" she tells us her grandfather first came to @entity1 to work on the railways and her family has been there ever since			1
her colleague chimes in that " @entity15 have been traders and economically they play a very big role in the @entity1 economy			1
" at a spice shop just down the road , meanwhile , the third generation @entity15 owner tells me that @entity1 @entity63 are spread widely across industries like construction , retail and tourism			1
the winds of trade of course , merchants from @entity15 and what 's now known as @entity72 had come to @entity0 long before the railway			1
the trade - routes linking @entity75 and @entity63 were already well established			0
@entity0 had been a city - state for over 2,000 years bearing long and fruitful relations with the @entity78 , @entity63 and the @entity79			0
in the port 's heyday " there was ivory being sold like the way we sell cakes now or mahamris as we call them , " said historian @entity80			0
" there was rhinoceros horns ... there was dry skin , there was spices , all this was happening at this port			0
" it was the railway lines , however , and the need for labor that first brought a mass migration of people from the sub-continent			0
by the mid- 1890 's , the @entity109 were effectively in control of @entity1 and were keen to open up the country 's interior and that of neighboring @entity32 to counter @entity106 influence in the region			1
having started construction of railway lines in @entity15 nearly 50 years earlier , @entity112 engineers and laborers had the skills the @entity109 required			1
the lion 's share more 30,000 indentured @entity15 workers were soon enticed to sail to @entity0 and a new life in @entity75			1
the country these expectant migrants found upon arrival , however , was vastly different to the land of comparative business opportunity their ancestors inhabit today			1
work on the railways was brutally hard			2
by the time it had reached its destination in @entity134 on the banks of @entity136 , roughly 625 miles from @entity0 , around 2,500 men had died			0
that 's four people for every mile			0
and it was n't just the oppressive heat and long hours workers had to contend with			2
the man eaters of @entity144 were a pair of lions that killed anywhere between 28 and more than 100 workers during the building of the railway , depending which account you believe			2
they spread such terror that work stopped until they were eventually shot			0
on top of that , there was also sickness and disease to contend with			0
" many people died of malaria and black fever when they were building because of the difficult terrain and there were no medical facilities resulting ( in ) many deaths , " said @entity160 , whose ancestors settled just outside @entity162 after the railway was built			1
" they had to take risks coming to this place , " she added			0
melting pot @entity175 is one of the many @entity1 @entity63 who today run their own businesses in the @entity178 and @entity179 districts of the @entity1 capital			1
she teaches the ancient @entity15 discipline of yoga , a far cry from the grueling and punishing work of the railway lines			2
but the history and contribution of @entity175 's ancestors in building the community and the infrastructure of the country make her proud of her roots			0
" i would not like to be distinguished as a @entity1 from a different region of the world , " @entity175 said			2
" i am born here and a third generation @entity63 @entity1			2
i proudly say that i am a @entity1			2
" such open and patriotic sentiments are n't uniform across the country , however			0
outside of the big metropolises such as @entity162 and @entity0 , there is a more complex relationship between communities			0
in @entity134 , where the great railway ends , issues of integration between @entity1 @entity63 and black @entity18 remain			1
although there are rarely tensions between the groups , neither mixes fully with the other			0
according to local mp @entity216 , himself a @entity1 @entity63 who married a black @entity1 woman , this is something that has to change			1
" there has not been a real integration ( in @entity134 ) ... like in @entity0 and @entity220 , " @entity216 said			0
" in @entity134 the integration is only when it 's in the shop or at the business ... but when they go out of that particular environment there is very little integration either by way of recreation or other facilities			0
" while @entity1 @entity63 's community makes a substantial economic contribution to wider society , @entity216 believes they should make more of an effort to mix with their compatriots and refrain from being " insular			1
" " we are less than 1.4 % ( of the population ) here in @entity1 but we hold the purse strings to maybe 30 % or 40 % of the economy , " @entity216 estimates			2
" ( but ) we must remember that if we earn here , we live here , we must contribute to this country			0
" that 's a sentiment that the very first @entity15 emigres to set foot in this beautiful country would have doubtless agreed with .			2

@entity15 migrants *flocked* to @entity1 just over a century ago to build railways
@entity253 attacks and diseases such as black fever were just a couple of the dangers workers on the railways faced
many *descendants* of those @entity15 migrants are today successful business owners across @entity1
some say that the @entity15 community has still not fully integrated into @entity1 society
