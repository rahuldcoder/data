when @entity1 first picked up an apple crate board to hit a ball against any flat surface she could find , @entity0 was always the dream			1
the tennis - obsessed youngster would play for hours on end against a wall or a water tank , at the time thinking the tournament was merely the stuff of fairy tales			1
" i read this princess magazine story , " recalls the 63 - year - old seven - time @entity15 singles winner in an interview with @entity18 at the @entity19			1
" one story was about this girl who trained and was taken to this place called @entity0 where she won on this magical court			2
" i did n't know it was for real but she said ' yes , this place exists in @entity29 '			2
" from that moment henceforth , the wall or water tank was the net at the @entity33 , the concrete under her feet the hallowed grass turf graced by so many past champions			2
" every time i went to sleep at night , i would dream about playing at that magical center court and every time i hit the wall i would pretend i was there			2
" @entity1 's fairy tale came true			1
nicknamed the ' sunshine super girl ' early in her career , @entity1 achieved exactly that feat in 1971 , winning the first of @entity15 titles			1
she is 12th on the list of all - time singles grand slam winners level with @entity51 and ended her career with 19 single titles in all			1
as well as two @entity0 titles , @entity1 also won the @entity19 four times , the @entity55 , three @entity57 titles and reached @entity58 in 1976			1
if the fairy tale came true , there were also many times when the clock struck midnight , with her story marked by episodes where -- as with so many @entity65 -- she was often treated as a second - class citizen			2
there was a regular fear of being taken away from her parents			2
many @entity71 thought the best practice was for @entity74 children to be removed from their families to be given a life away from poverty and an education in white @entity71 society			2
" whenever a car would come down the road , my mum would tell us to hide ' or else the welfare man would take you away , ' " she recalls			2
even as an adult she was acutely aware of how @entity65 could be excluded from everyday life -- even after winning @entity0			2
" before i started traveling overseas and i was with a friend and in those days i loved music and i loved disco dancing so she took me out but i was n't allowed in			2
" that happened again in @entity93 and i was with two @entity74 friends and this was just after i won @entity0			0
i said ' do n't worry we 'll go somewhere else '			0
i think it hurt my friends more than me			0
" the @entity1 family were the only @entity65 in the small town of @entity101 in @entity102			1
her father @entity103 was a hard - working sheep shearer , who gained notoriety for being able to shear 100 animals in a day			0
the tennis star was the third of @entity103 and @entity111 's eight children			1
in her town , @entity1 became renowned for her tennis and was first invited to play on a court when a neighbor , @entity115 , caught her peering through the fence			1
following encouragement from locals , tennis coach @entity117 traveled up from @entity120 to see the then 10 - year - old play			1
he persuaded her parents to let him bring her to the metropolis , enrolled her in school , coached her and , for a time , had her live with him			0
she arrived in the big city with her first tennis dress , made for her by her mother from sheets and with equipment paid for by the people of her home town			1
there was no pressure on her to play the sport by her parents and her mother would never ask on her return after a match if she had won , merely if she had had fun			1
encountering racism in tennis @entity120 was to provide no respite from the racism @entity1 had to face			1
she especially remembers an incident while playing with @entity117 ' daughter against two older ladies			0
" one of the older ladies did n't like the idea of two youngsters beating up on them			0
when it was time to shake hands			0
" and she said ; ' this is the first time i 've had the pleasure of playing a @entity157 ' and i 've never heard that before and i started to get really upset			0
" as her mentor @entity117 did his best to shield her from such prejudice			0
" he taught me not to believe in what you read , believe in yourself so i never read anything			0
i realize now he was blocking me from a lot of things			0
" i always just thought of myself as a tennis player			1
i was protected from a lot of publicity and politics of life			0
" but her tennis success helped @entity1 break down barriers , becoming the first non-white to play in apartheid @entity172 in a tournament in 1972			1
even today , she is helping indigenous people in @entity71 with the foundation she has set up with her husband , the former @entity178 tennis player @entity177			1
her motto for it -- as it was during her playing days -- is " dream , believe , learn , achieve			0
" the program encourages the children to play tennis but also to stay in school as they do so			1
" the reason why i 'm doing this is because i would n't be here unless i had the initial support of the townspeople of @entity101			0
that 's why i am doing what i am doing today , trying to help young indigenous kids find their dream			1
" by the time she arrived as a player at her dream location of @entity0 , the then 18 - year - old , also known as ' @entity199 , ' was already well known to the @entity178 press			0
she was put on the show courts , unheard of back then for an unheralded young player			0
" i did n't realize they were writing about me before i got there , " she recalls			0
" they did n't normally put a young person first time at @entity0 on center court but they did with me			0
" it really scared the hell out of me and i wanted to get off the court as quickly as possible and i did			0
" on her return the following year in 1971 , she beat the great @entity213 and fellow @entity71 in the final , although graciously insists that was only because her opponent was pregnant and not moving to the best of her ability			0
however , @entity1 repeated the feat on the same hallowed turf in 1980 with a three - year - old daughter in tow			1
in so doing , she was the first mother to be crowned @entity0 champion since before the outset of @entity225 ' had become ' super mum			0
' but for all the monikers , titles and accolades , " having fun " was the key motivation			1
" i believe that 's what life is all about			2
i certainly had a lot of fun during my career playing tennis , doing the thing i wanted to do and to do it well			1

@entity1 's tennis play began with an apple crate board
but she reached world @entity58 and achieved seven @entity15 titles in the process
as an @entity251 , though , there were issues of racism she faced in her career
