-- step by step , in the soft sweet light just before dawn , we climb a knife edge of @entity7 sand			2
we are walking up one of what are said to be the world 's tallest dunes			1
one dune called " @entity13 " rises 380 meters , or about a quarter - mile , from its base , soaring above the hardscrabble scrub - brush and acacia - dotted landscape of western @entity7 's @entity19 - @entity18 desert			1
this area , known as @entity13 , is remote , about 300 kilometers ( 186 miles ) south - southwest of the capital , @entity22 , and an equal distance southeast from @entity24			1
but it is worth the long desert drive			2
the dunes at @entity13 are a natural wonder of the world			1
the sand beneath our feet is powdery , as soft as talcum			2
weather and water have crushed it			1
there are no rocks and no trees on the dunes ' steep slopes , just scattered patches of grass			1
the night winds and dry sand prevent the rest			2
there are only the fresh footprints of the few people leading the way up the sharp , narrow crest of the dune			2
the slopes fall away just a step on either side			2
we have to stop to safely gaze across the barren valley at the silhouetted outlines of more towering dunes , set against the now dark but slowly lightening sky			1
it 's difficult in the early morning to see the color			1
but as the sun slowly rises , for a few more minutes invisible just below the horizon , the dunes ' rich deep orange - red colors begin to emerge			1
send in your shots from @entity7 the reason we , and so many others , have come here is for the moment just minutes away , when the sun will suddenly blast above the edge of the parched earth , revealing a landscape that 's at once starkly beautiful , sensationally dramatic and incredibly rare			1
geologists will tell you that @entity7 's dunes are built and shaped by wind and carved by water			1
they are believed to be 60 million to 80 million years old , made of sand pushed inland over the eons from the coast by @entity86 winds that sweep onshore 80 kilometers to the west			1
here , near the settlement of @entity90 , westerly winds from the @entity18 to the east collide with the @entity86 winds , stopping the dunes ' advance			1
when the wind from the west meets the wind from the east , the sand is pushed upward like the ocean waves the dunes resemble			1
it forms almost perfectly symmetrical " star " dunes , each with several arms extending outward from the summit			1
the eastern mountains do n't face the entire expanse of dunes , so the wind cuts the @entity13 valley into a " @entity113 " shape			1
the result is a region of sharply defined massive sculpted sand piles surrounding a vast valley			0
@entity118 too has shaped this region , although mostly it is long gone			1
the ephemeral @entity120 flows nearby , but only during rainy periods			0
the water storms through the dune valley , but the dunes stop its advance			1
it pushes forward and gathers into small lakes at the base of the dunes but often quickly dries up			1
in a few spots , the water remains , forming shallow marshlands called " vlei " ( pronounced " vlay " ) that support trees , birds , frogs and other small wildlife			1
grasses provide food for springbok , gemsbok and oryx			0
quiz : what do you know about the rest of @entity7 ? in most places , though , are the remains of dried - up marshlands , barren clay and salt basins that contain the dunes ' dramatic foil : the dead acacia or " camel thorn " trees			1
their black , twisted , petrified remains are said to be as old as 900 years , the harsh remnants of the life that once thrived in the now - vanished lakes			1
black pied crows perch in their dead branches and then suddenly take off in flocks to surf the swirling breezes around the dunes			1
the most prominent dead lake is called , appropriately , @entity168			0
it is a broad basin of parched ground surrounded by dunes			1
it is accessible along a dirt and sand path that crosses smaller dunes on one end			1
as we walk over the crest , the bone - dry basin appears below			1
once , centuries ago , there was a lake here			0
now , blackened petrified acacias rise hauntingly from the hard vlei floor			0
@entity184 once filmed a scene here for the movie " @entity188			0
" the lunar ground crackles slightly beneath our feet as we walk out to the tree @entity193 posed against			0
it is a perfect place for science - fiction , but it is very starkly real			1
the @entity197 itself is closed at night			0
visitors stay at lodges and campgrounds in @entity90 , the settlement outside the park ( see accommodation information below )			0
in the darkness before dawn , they drive the 60 - kilometer ( 37 - mile ) road from @entity90 and line up at the entrance gate , then gingerly navigate the rough road about 5 more kilometers to the first dunes			1
one needs a high - clearance 4x4 to reach most areas of the valley , including many of the popular sites			1
it 's easy to suddenly drive into deep sand			1
on one tract , we had to help a family push out their loaded - down 2x4			1
this is a bad place to ignore sound advice			0
the most popular dune to climb is called @entity225			0
it is easily accessible from the entrance road , and from its crest is where most visitors view the sunrise			0
from the top , the view is otherworldly			0
the sun rises and the dunes ' color emerges , slowly changing and brightening in the desert 's morning light			1
ahead of us , waves of dunes twist across the basin			1
behind us , sand sweeps back toward the ocean			0
we sit , take photographs and play a bit in the sand , always mindful of the steep slopes around us			0
when it comes time to descend , there are two ways down : walk back down along the crest you climbed up or sand - ski down the slope			1
the second option is very steep and only for the daring			0
those who choose the slope hop and zig - zag across and down , as if they 're skiing			2
many slightly less intrepid visitors try the slope descent sitting			0
the sand is so soft and deep , and there are no obstacles to hit , but it is a long way down			0
still , with just a little care , it is very hard to get hurt			0
it is a natural playground			0
endless exploration , hiking and dune climbing await			0
from one vlei , we notice tiny movements atop one of the distant dunes , the outlines of two climbers reaching a summit			2
but visitors must watch the time			0
by midday , the desert can become blazingly hot , and there is little shade			0
the footprints of this morning 's visitors mark the dunes they have climbed			1
by noon , most are leaving the park			0
by nightfall , the winds will pick up again , sweeping across the sand , erasing the footprints			0
the dunes ' slopes will quickly return to what they have been for millennia : soft , silent , unmarked -- ready to dwarf and astonish the next day 's visitors			1
if @entity300 getting there @entity90 is reached by mostly decent , well - marked roads from @entity7 's capital , @entity22 , and from @entity24 on the coast			1
both cities have international airports , and rental cars including 4x4s are available			0
the drive from either city takes about 4Â½ hours , and since the goal is to visit @entity13 at dawn , it is an overnight trip			1
gasoline is sporadically available en route , but the region is remote , and it is wise to fill up before leaving the city and carry some food , water and sunscreen			2
many @entity7 tour companies offer escorted trips from @entity22 and @entity24 to sesriem / @entity13			1
they are easily found online			0
accommodations an increasing number of accommodations , from campgrounds to upscale lodges , await visitors in and around @entity90			0
be mindful that @entity90 is more like a settlement than a town			0
gasoline and limited groceries are available in lodge and campground gift shops			0
