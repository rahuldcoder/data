-- our nightmare began in 1993 after we moved from the city to a house down a winding country road abutting a spruce forest in @entity7 , @entity8			2
our little woods were home to mice , deer and ticks harboring the infectious agent of @entity15			1
we were n't especially concerned			0
as seasoned science journalists , my husband and i had researched the risk of tick - borne disease by reading medical journals , finding a raft of articles on a wave of " lyme hysteria " sweeping the @entity27 suburbs ; the disease , some of the authors said , was mild and benign			1
perhaps that 's why , as one of our sons and then the other got sick , our pediatrician resisted testing for @entity15			1
when my older son , @entity38 , 14 , developed a mottled rash spreading over his torso in 1998 , our doctor 's office told us that because it was n't a literal bull 's eye -- believed to be the classic indication of @entity15 -- it could n't be @entity15 ( a misconception still common today despite voluminous research to the contrary )			2
by 2000 , @entity38 suffered aversion to light , profound fatigue and shooting pain throughout his arms and legs			0
mostly to placate me , our pediatrician finally ordered a @entity15 test			2
but our doctor still rejected lyme disease as the cause , instead proposing a psychiatric disorder			1
the university - based psychiatrist we then consulted called the pediatrician a quack			0
our older son , he said , was physically ill. my family would spend the next decade struggling to get well			2
along the way , we had to navigate one of the most vitriolic fights in medicine			0
as the scientific community fought over the very nature of @entity15 , debating everything from who actually had it to what treatment worked best , misdiagnosed patients were left to wander the medical outback without a compass or any clear path back to health			1
caused by the spirochete -- a coiled bacterium such as the one that causes syphilis -- @entity82 , @entity15 is the most frequently reported tick - borne disease in the @entity84			1
in 2011 , some 33,000 cases met the @entity87 's definition			0
but there are far more patients with the infection since only a fraction of cases are reported			2
when doctors attuned to the @entity87 's rigorous definition resist diagnosing any but the most classic patients -- those with an obvious @entity15 rash or highly positive test -- it means patients are left to advance to later , harder - to - treat stages of the disease			1
adding to the mess , physicians frequently fail to test for other , often - debilitating infections from the same black - legged ticks : @entity107 , the cause of a malaria - like illness ; @entity110 , an intracellular bacterium ; and another spirochete , @entity113 , recently documented as the cause of a relapsing - remitting @entity15 - like disease			1
in fact , there is a lot of confusion over what may or may not be causing @entity15 and other tick - borne diseases around the @entity84			2
in @entity123 , scientists have found several new spirochetes yet to be vetted as sources of @entity15 - like illness , and researchers in @entity128 just isolated @entity15 spirochetes from ticks despite @entity87 's website saying not to worry			1
then there 's the smackdown over chronic @entity15 : do @entity15 patients stay sick following treatment because the infection is still there ? in the 1990s , the @entity139 sought to answer the question by funding a series of studies , the first of which has informed the treatment guidelines published by the @entity144 ever since			1
that study monitored 136 @entity15 patients who remained chronically ill after antibiotic therapy			1
in other words , they still showed symptoms of the illness			0
and yet some 700 blood and spinal fluid samples taken from them yielded no hint of the spirochete			0
on one side , experts embraced this small study as proof that chronic @entity15 was a myth			2
they believed the sickness had to be caused by something else since patients showed no sign of the spirochete			0
but patients and their doctors were unconvinced			0
spirochetes leave body fluids for tissue early in the course of disease , after all , explaining lack of evidence in blood			0
and researchers had reported persistent spirochetes in the tissue of treated mammals for years			0
to resolve the mystery , the @entity139 commissioned similar experiments with rhesus monkeys			0
instead of searching monkey blood for dna after antibiotic treatment , the researchers would sacrifice the animals and scour their tissue for signs of the @entity15 spirochete , including the rna that is a surer sign of active disease			1
the monkey studies , published in 2012 by scientists at @entity192 , document the presence of @entity182 following aggressive antibiotic treatment			1
when uninfected ticks fed on those treated monkeys , they literally ingested intact spirochetes -- proof that the organism remained			0
are small numbers of living spirochetes driving persistent symptoms ? scientific resolution has yet to come , but even the @entity139 has seen fit to ask the question , launching an ongoing study that tests the ability of treated patients to transmit living @entity15 spirochetes to biting ticks			1
despite so many unknowns , continued insistence that @entity15 patients are mentally ill has been a drumbeat in our @entity215 , creating a stigma that hampers treatment or the chance of getting well			1
what we need here , the @entity223 has suggested , is a " process of conflict resolution " to create " a new environment of trust			0
" progress in research can only happen if the key stakeholders -- the patients -- are included in the work			0
some groups have tried : in june , the @entity233 held a meeting to help develop better tests			0
this is a crucial endeavor since standard tests based on legacy technology pick up real patients between just 45 % and 75 % of the time , especially in the early phase of the disease			1
patients and scientists worked together on the @entity233 event , but collaboration has often been difficult if not impossible to achieve			2
for instance , a group of scientists has lobbied against federal legislation to increase funding for @entity15 research			1
why ? that 's just counterproductive			0
powerful 21st - century technologies can help us , but first we 've got to admit that waters are muddy and urgent questions remain			0
calling patients " lyme - loonies " or " part of an anti-science movement that denies both the viral cause of @entity262 and the benefits of vaccines , " is hurtful and untrue			2
after all , questioning the value of research that keeps one locked in illness is hardly on par with denying @entity269			0
the real science deniers are those circling the wagons around outdated studies , leaving patients desperate and sick while protecting their academic turf			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity278 .			2

@entity278 : her family went through nightmare in *grappling* with lyme disease
@entity278 : deep divisions in the medical community hinder real solution on the disease
she says it is *unclear* if @entity15 agent stays in patients ' bodies even after treatment
@entity278 : scientists need to stop fighting , listen to patients and conduct new studies
