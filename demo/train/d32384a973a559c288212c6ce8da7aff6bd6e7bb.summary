-- back in the pool for the first time since 2012 , @entity1 was close to his peerless best			1
the most decorated @entity4 of all time raced to a second - place finish in the 100m butterfly final in front of a sell - out crowd at the @entity10 , @entity11			1
@entity12 came up two - tenths of a second short of an instant return to winning ways with a time of 51.93 seconds -- coming in just behind his longtime rival and friend @entity18			1
@entity12 time ranks as the fourth fastest this year , and -- although two seconds slower than his own 49.82 world record -- the 28 - year - old was satisfied			1
" i said i wanted to be around 52.0 and i would be completely happy with that , " @entity12 told @entity25 , before reiterating that has future was still undecided			2
" it 's one meet ; it 's one race			0
it 's a long way whether i decide to continue or not			0
" a 628 - day wait the 1,200 people in attendance might have been a few less than the 17,000 he entertained at his last race -- the gold medal - winning 4x100 medley relay at the @entity36 -- but the 18 - time olympic gold medalist told reporters he had n't felt so nervous about a race since he was a 10 - year - old			1
@entity12 retired after winning an unprecedented 22nd @entity42 medal on 4 august 2012 and embarked on a year of travel and golfing with little mention of a return to swimming			1
but @entity12 sparked speculation about a potential comeback by re-entering the @entity51 's testing program last november -- which began a nine - month wait required before a swimmer can again compete			2
taking to the pool in competition for the first time in 628 days , he had cruised through his qualifying heat with the fastest time of 52.84 seconds , just ahead of @entity18 who went on to win the final in the second fastest time in the world this year			1
" i probably would n't have gone that time if @entity12 was n't in that pool with me			2
we push each other all the time , " said @entity18			2
" down there at the turn i kind of peeked over and i saw him and almost started smiling , " @entity18 said , at which point , @entity12 interjected : " why ? because you were ahead ? " the future @entity12 is still non-committal on his swimming future , and declared himself happy to have shed his post-retirement weight gain , and post a strong time			1
i 'm really excited about how things went			0
i do know what i need to do if i want to continue and swim faster			0
" he will also race in today 's 50m freestyle in @entity11 but , beyond that , he has not yet committed to the @entity80 national championships in august or next year 's world championships in @entity82 , @entity83			0
inevitably the question of a return to @entity42 action arose -- with a potential fifth games in @entity88 now just over two years away			0
but @entity12 says he is taking " one step at a time			1
" for now , the screaming crowd and @entity18 's delighted welcome mark a tentative beginning to the legend 's comeback			0
" with what he 's done for the sport of swimming and him leaving kind of broke my heart a little because i love getting on those blocks and racing him , " said @entity18			0
" now that he 's back i 've got a big ol ' smile on my face			0
" and for @entity12 , too , the enjoyment is just starting : " you 're going to hear this word come out of my mouth a lot , " he told reporters , " but i was having fun			0

@entity1 finishes second in his first race since 2012
