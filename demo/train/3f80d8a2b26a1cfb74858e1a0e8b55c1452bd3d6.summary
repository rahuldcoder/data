-- i 've been tasked with the assignment of following president @entity3 on two legs of his @entity6 trip for his charity the @entity7			1
we join him and his large entourage in @entity11 , @entity12 , where he 's visiting an @entity14 orphanage about an hour 's drive outside the city			1
despite the heat and humidity , the president walks around the facility , speaking to local staff through a translator , commending them on their tireless work			1
his foundation provides tuberculosis medicine for the children infected with @entity14 and it 's saving lives			1
the children perform a dance for their distinguished visitor -- and the president ca n't wipe the smile off his face			1
" i was watching them dancing and they gave me a little poster where each of them wrote what their dreams are for the future , " explains @entity3 , who is clearly moved by what he has just witnessed			1
" when we came here first in 2006 every one of the children was @entity14 positive			1
they would have eventually died from @entity14			1
they had no future , so to see them now healthy and alive it 's just amazing			1
" @entity3 says he decided at a very early age that he wanted to dedicate his life to public service			1
meeting president @entity51 at the @entity52 as a student in 1963 and listening to @entity55 's " @entity59 " speech the same year was a life changing experience that he says firmly placed him on his path			1
i ask if his charity gives him a sense a purpose			2
" oh yeah , " he says in his folksy southern drawl			0
" i like it because it 's personal flesh and blood			2
you 're not just talking in abstract policy terms			2
you are actually seeing the lives of people change and it 's one of the great things about the life i have now			2
" i loved my life in politics -- i loved it			0
but the difference now is i can see the personal human implications of the decisions we are making			0
" " and then you see results -- there they are			0
those kids dancing -- i would n't take the world for that			0
i 'm going to have a film of that and i 'm going to have that all my life now			0
" @entity93 , @entity94 , and the rise of @entity96 he speaks with emotion and it 's more than just being at the orphanage			1
he just found out that some of the people on board @entity103 17 when it went down over @entity106 were due to attend the @entity14 conference he will soon be speaking at in @entity108 , @entity109			1
i mean those people are really in a way martyrs to the cause			0
we need to wait to make any definitive statements until we know exactly what happened but it was sickening -- thinking about those people being knocked out of the sky			0
" we discuss world issues such as the @entity94 offensive and the ongoing @entity122 conflict -- a conflict he tried to resolve while in the @entity52			1
he believes it 's up to @entity127 to clinch a peace deal with the @entity129 , but i ask him if that 's realistic considering the current state of war			2
" well i think it 's possible partly because you get tired of doing the same thing over and over again and getting the same result -- it 's crazy			2
i hope that this will lead to a little soul searching and trying to get back to the baseline issue of a peace agreement			0
" our conversation moves on to the isolationist policy now being adopted by the @entity143 after its long wars in both @entity145 and @entity146			1
i ask if @entity143 is still the world 's policeman and he replies : " i do n't think we have been the world 's policeman since the end of the @entity152			1
" " but i do think we have been more active and less active over time			0
the wars in @entity146 and @entity145 were highly costly to us			0
they cost us a lot in lives and wounds and national treasure			0
we have a lot of work to do within the @entity143 to rebuild our economic strength			1
but i think we have been and should be active in the world			0
" on the issue of a rising @entity96 that is becoming more assertive in its foreign policy , especially in the @entity166 , he says he is " concerned			1
" " the @entity96 obviously have a legitimate interest in and right to try to develop a natural capacity to have enough natural resources to continue to grow their economy			1
but i think it 's a big mistake for them to be seen as big footing the whole region			2
" historically that 's not been their role and wherever they have done it they have wound up paying a price bigger than the benefit they got			2
this whole thing is still playing out so this where we ought to be working for the best and preparing for the worst			0
" @entity189 2016 ? towards the end of the interview i ask the question on everyone 's lips -- will @entity195 in 2016			2
it 's a question he 's been asked a thousand times and will continue to be asked until his wife makes an official announcement			2
" i do n't know , " he explains			0
" i think she really needs some time to think this through			0
we reached a point in our life when we think you should n't run for office if you do n't have a clear idea of what you can do and a unique contribution you can make you can outline that			0
" so much of politics is background noise and we do n't need the background noise anymore			0
i am proud of her and whatever she does is fine with me			0
i 'll support what she does			2
" i get the feeling he wants his wife -- who he met in the spring of 1971 in a library at @entity224 -- to run			0
it would be history in the making -- @entity143 's first female president and the first husband and wife to ever be leaders of the free world			1
" it 's a decision that only she can make and i 'm not going to try and jump the gun , and if she decides not to do it i 'll be happy too , " he says			1
" we have a lot of good years left i hope regardless			0
so we will do whatever happens			0
