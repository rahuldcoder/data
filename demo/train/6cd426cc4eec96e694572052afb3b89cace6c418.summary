an @entity1 border police officer has been detained in connection with the shooting death of a @entity6 teenager , an arrest that a human rights advocate described as " incredibly rare			1
" the police officer was arrested tuesday , according to @entity1 police spokesman @entity10			1
and on wednesday , a judge extended the officer 's detention six more days , according to a court order			0
@entity15 , the father of the late 16 - year - old @entity16 , called the arrest " a step in the right direction			0
" at the same time , he noted the police officer still has not been formally charged , much less convicted and sentenced			1
" when this gets in the court of law , then @entity1 has the chance to prove to the world that it is not above the law , " the father said			2
" there ca n't be two laws for two people , meaning if an @entity1 killed a @entity6 , would he get the same amount of prison time ( as a @entity6 who killed an @entity1 ) ? " his son was one of two teenagers killed in the @entity37 community of @entity38 on may 15 , the anniversary of the " @entity40 , " the exodus of more than 700,000 @entity6 after the 1948 @entity43 - @entity1 war			1
father blames @entity1 military in @entity6 teens ' deaths cameras that @entity49 set up around his four - story @entity38 house showed @entity16 suddenly falling forward , landing briefly on his hands , then rolling over to lie on his back			1
within seconds , a crowd of @entity6 gathered to lift @entity16 and rush him to a waiting ambulance			2
according to a medical report , @entity16 was pronounced dead in a hospital less than two hours later , having suffered a single bullet wound that entered his chest and passed out his back			0
@entity2 producer @entity60 filmed the same clashes -- including video showing two @entity1 security troops firing their rifles at @entity6 protesters at the same exact moment that @entity16 was shot			1
in that video , it is not clear what kind of rounds the @entity1 were shooting or whether their gunfire hit @entity16			2
however , @entity60 's camera shows that less than 15 seconds after one of these gunshots , @entity6 were already racing to put the fatally wounded @entity16 in the ambulance			2
after a @entity2 report on the incident , the @entity1 military suspended a soldier shown firing that day at demonstrators , according to an @entity1 military source who asked not to be identified because of the continuing investigation			0
the source said the suspended soldier worked for the military 's communications department and was not supposed to be shooting at all			0
it was not immediately clear what connection , if any , this soldier had to the arrested border police officer			1
source : @entity1 suspends soldier after @entity6 deaths security cameras captured the second fatal shooting that day of a @entity6 teen -- 17 - year - old @entity94 -- just before 3 p.m. , showing him suddenly fall to the ground just steps from where @entity16 was wounded			2
doctors pronounced @entity94 dead on arrival at the hospital , with a bullet wound that had pierced his back and exited his chest			0
no arrests have been made in connection with @entity94 's death			0
" the investigation is continuing , " @entity10 said			0
the @entity1 human rights organization @entity107 arranged for the exhumation of @entity16 's body 15 days after his burial so that an autopsy could be performed			1
@entity112 , from @entity107 , told @entity2 that the autopsy revealed the " three fragments of a bullet and an entry and exit wound " were consistent with a live round , rather than rubber - coated bullets that @entity1 forces periodically fire at protesters			0
the bullet , found at the time of death in the teen 's backpack , and the three bullet fragments , found in his body , were handed to @entity1 investigators , @entity112 said			2
investigators should be able to tell if the fragments came from that bullet and what weapon fired it , she added			0
and experts were able to " calculate the firing angle from which the shot was taken " based on where the bullets entered and left the teenager 's body , according to the human rights advocate			1
talking about the border police officer 's arrest , @entity112 said , " ( it is ) very , very rare			1
" @entity2 's @entity144 contributed to this report .			0
