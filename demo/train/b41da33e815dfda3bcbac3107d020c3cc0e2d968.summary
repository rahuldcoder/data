@entity0 -- the @entity4 administration will not support a policy of taxing drivers based on their mileage , the @entity2 said friday after a published interview in which secretary @entity9 called it an idea " we should look at			1
" the mileage tax idea involves tracking drivers through gps units in their cars			1
in a written statement , the department said , " the policy of taxing motorists based on how many miles they have traveled is not and will not be @entity4 administration policy			1
" the idea -- which involves tracking drivers through @entity23 ( gps ) units in their cars -- is gaining support in some states as a way of making up for a shortfall in highway funding			1
@entity30 carried out a pilot program and deemed it " successful			1
" speaking to @entity32 , @entity33 , an @entity35 @entity34 , said , " we should look at the vehicular miles program where people are actually clocked on the number of miles that they traveled			1
" the remark was part of a discussion about various options to help make up for the highway funding shortfall on the federal level			0
when contacted by @entity1 , the @entity2 said @entity9 was unavailable			1
a spokeswoman provided the department 's statement and said she could not elaborate			0
officials in @entity52 told @entity1 this week that there has been talk of proposing such a system for the state			0
@entity57 , a spokesman for gov. @entity58 , said " privacy would be our top priority			0
" @entity58 on friday announced a different plan to help raise highway funds : a 19 - cent increase in the state 's gas tax			2
but he said that alone " will not solve all our challenges , " and some " major reforms " will be needed			0
under a @entity70 ( vehicle miles traveled ) tax program , gps units would allow the government to keep track of how much each car is driven and where -- though not necessarily with exact street locations			1
the government could also track other things , including the time each car enters a certain zone			2
for decades , the fuel taxes that drivers pay at the pump have been the central source of federal and state funding for roads and bridges			2
but they are no longer nearly enough			0
last fall , @entity89 approved an $ 8 billion infusion into the depleted federal highway trust fund			0
the problem stems in part from something good : more and more @entity95 are buying vehicles that have better gas mileage			2
that means less gas tax money from each car , though the car is causing the same amount of wear and tear on the roads			2
officials including @entity9 have opposed raising the national gas tax , particularly in the current recession , and have said a new system is needed			1
a report by the @entity30 @entity111 , published in november 2007 , said a " @entity113 " found that a @entity70 tax is " viable			1
" " privacy is protected , " the report argued , saying the pilot program included " engineering requirements to maintain as much privacy as practicable while still allowing a feasible way to audit and challenge billings			1
" " no specific vehicle point location or trip data could be stored or transmitted " in the pilot program , and " the only centrally stored data needed to assess mileage fees were vehicle identification , zone mileage totals for each vehicle and the amount of fuel purchased			1
" some officials support using tracking zones and times of day in determining a @entity70 tax , so that more would be charged for driving on crowded roads during rush hour			2
but some people across the country have spoken up against a @entity70 tax			2
" is this a good idea ? in a word , no , " columnist @entity141 wrote in january for @entity142			0
" at best , it 's overcomplicated and intrusive			0
at worst , it 's a threat to privacy and the environment			0
" @entity141 added , " gas taxes are a pretty good proxy for road usage -- the more you drive , the more gas you burn -- and there 's a bonus : gas taxes encourage people to use less gas			0
... a mileage tax , presumably , does n't care whether you 're driving a @entity159 or a @entity160 , giving no incentive to save			1
" the @entity162 in @entity163 -- which describes itself as standing for " liberty and prosperity derived from limited government " -- said it carried out a poll in @entity163 and found that voters disapprove of the idea			1
a federal blue - ribbon panel plans to issue a report next week on ways the country can make up for its highway funding shortfall			0
other possibilities include tolls , higher registration fees and other types of taxes			0
in its interim report , the @entity180 said new technologies could allow for a mileage gas tax that would take into account the type of vehicle and level of emissions			1
programs of that type are being developed in other countries , including @entity193 and the @entity194 , the report said			0
it added , " such programs may not be ripe for widespread implementation in the @entity95 yet , but are maturing rapidly			0
" @entity1 's @entity198 contributed to this report .			0
