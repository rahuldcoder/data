more than 100 undocumented children without families were expected to arrive in @entity3 from south @entity4 on sunday as part of a federal transport of underage immigrants to the state by the @entity9 , a spokesman said			1
last week , nearly 1,000 " unaccompanied alien children " had already arrived in @entity10 and @entity11 from places like @entity13 and @entity14 , @entity4 , as part of a resettlement process of the minors , most of whom come from @entity20 , to their native countries			1
unlike a @entity25 immigrant who arrives to the @entity26 , a @entity20 immigrant can not be processed as quickly because of proximity to their native country			1
@entity9 is prohibited from immediately deporting the children if they are not from @entity31 or @entity25 , causing the backlog of immigrants in @entity26 detention centers			1
facilities in @entity4 were at or near capacity for the immigrants because of a " record increase in underage migrants , " which led to the transfer of hundreds to @entity3 , a spokesman said			1
although children crossing the border alone has long been an issue , the recent spike could be attributed to better weather or worsening economic conditions in their home countries , officials said			1
others simply want to be reunited with their parents , who may have left them with relatives in their native countries			0
separate from unaccompanied children being sent to the state , family groups were also being sent by the federal government to @entity3 , a process that has outraged @entity3 lawmakers , including gov. @entity59			1
she released a statement friday saying that @entity9 was transporting " thousands of illegal aliens and releasing them at bus stations in @entity10 and @entity11			1
" " i am disturbed and outraged that president @entity65 's administration continues to implement this dangerous and inhumane policy , meanwhile neglecting to answer crucial questions our citizens demand and deserve , " @entity59 wrote			1
" not only does the federal government have no plan to stop this disgraceful policy , it also has no plan to deal with the endless waves of illegal aliens once they are released here , " @entity59 added			1
as of late last week , @entity79 was no longer releasing " large family groups " at the bus stops in @entity3 , a @entity9 spokesman said , but children under age 17 are continuing to be transferred to the state			1
" the situation with the kids are they came by themselves , they have no relatives here , and the consulates ca n't keep up			0
there 's no one ( back home ) to deport them to , " a @entity9 spokesman told @entity91			2
raising a larger humanitarian concern are the conditions to which the immigrant children are arriving			2
a facility in @entity101 , @entity3 , with capacity for about 1,500 , does not have enough food or beds to accommodate the current demand , a spokesman said			2
there are currently no showers for the immigrants , either , but those were expected to be in place by tuesday , according to a spokesman			0
" the @entity101 processing center is equipped and used for processing apprehended individuals			0
the @entity114 has secured additional services such as a @entity117 medical screening area , additional bedding , shower areas and laundry facilities			2
vendors have been contracted to provide nutritional meals , @entity123 will be providing counseling services and recreational activities , " @entity121 said in a statement			0
" upon completion of @entity121 processing ... custody determinations will be made on a case - by - case basis , " the statement said			0
the record spike in migrants coming from @entity20 and crossing into the @entity26 via @entity25 is not expected to slow down , a spokesman told @entity91			2
more than 60,000 unaccompanied juveniles are expected to cross in 2014 , said @entity137 , vice president of the @entity138 in the @entity139 , a @entity26 @entity141 workers union			0
" we are seeing numbers that we 've never seen before in this part of the country , " @entity137 told @entity91 last month			0
" yesterday , we had 60 minors in one station alone			0
you 're talking kids from 17 years old , on down to some that are 5 or 6 years old , traveling by themselves			0
" last year , roughly 10 % of people caught by @entity141 agents were minors , according to a @entity141 official			0
states work around @entity157 to help undocumented immigrants new federal guidelines ban schools from conducting immigration checks on kids border showdown : families demand @entity26 entry to reunite with relatives			0

the number of undocumented children has spiked , straining @entity4 centers
@entity9 has transferred nearly 1,000 youngsters to @entity3 facilities
better weather , worsening economies in @entity20 may be factors
@entity3 gov. @entity59 *objects* to earlier family group transfers to her state
