-- @entity1 and @entity2 did n't reach the final nuclear deal they were striving for , but the short - term extension of talks announced monday should help ensure more progress can be made , both in preventing a nuclear - armed @entity8 and reducing the chances of yet another war in the @entity11			1
true , significant gaps remain to be bridged between the @entity13 and @entity8 , and it is clearer than ever that nuclear diplomacy is not a sprint but a marathon			1
yet these negotiations are worth persevering with , not just because we are on the brink of a diplomatic solution to the impasse over @entity8 's nuclear program , but also because of the potentially far - reaching impact on stabilizing the @entity11			1
remember , @entity8 has enough power in @entity26 to reduce the bloodletting -- or to intensify the war			1
the @entity29 and @entity26 's recruiting base depends in part on atrocities being committed by the regime of @entity26 president @entity34 to continue to grow			0
@entity8 's unmatched influence over the @entity34 regime therefore makes it a critical player in negotiating a political solution to @entity26 's civil war			1
as @entity44 , the @entity45 special envoy to @entity26 , pointed out , " @entity8 is an important player and i hope a partner in what should be a political process			1
" both of @entity44 's predecessors , @entity48 and @entity49 , as well as @entity45 @entity50 ban ki - moon have also pressed for @entity8 's inclusion in negotiations to end the @entity26 civil war			1
the @entity13 has long insisted that @entity8 must first sign the @entity54 before it is permitted a seat at the table in the @entity26 negotiations			2
the @entity54 is the preliminary accord calling for a " transitional governing body " to rule @entity26 , which was signed at the first international negotiations over @entity26 's future			0
while @entity2 has refused this precondition , @entity8 's participation in the talks may be the only way to secure even the most limited ceasefire agreement			0
the transitional governing body called for by the preliminary agreement may never come into being without @entity8 's buy - in			0
strained relations between the @entity13 and @entity8 make that buy - in from @entity2 nearly impossible			0
the recent thaw , however , offers hope			0
the @entity74 recently released a report by more than 30 national security experts concluding that there is " a strong link between settling the nuclear standoff and @entity13 's ability to play an effective role in a rapidly changing @entity11 , and that a nuclear agreement will help unlock the door to new options			0
" the bipartisan signatories include two former @entity13 ambassadors to @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , as well as pre-eminent national security advisers @entity90 and @entity92			0
the nuclear deal could help unlock the door to a political solution to the @entity26 civil war , a prospect raised in the report			2
the authors rightly noted , for example , that " the inclusion of @entity8 would be a crucial addition that would increase the possibility of success " to relieve the immediate humanitarian crisis and develop a long - term political solution for @entity26 's future			1
indeed , the report went as far as to say that , because @entity8 is so influential in the @entity26 civil war , " another international meeting would be fruitless " if talks do n't include @entity8 as well as the @entity26 government			1
so long as @entity8 is part of the problem in @entity26 , engagement with @entity2 has to be part of a solution			2
that is not to say that engaging @entity2 to address the @entity26 crises will be a quick fix for the brutality of either @entity29 or the @entity26 regime			0
@entity8 hard - liners in high places are intent on providing a military lifeline to the @entity34 regime			0
the power struggle between the hard - line @entity126 and @entity8 president @entity129 's more moderate faction is alive and well -- and the hard - liners currently control @entity8 's @entity26 policy			2
finally , a nuclear accord may also help tip the balance in internal @entity8 politics , with a breakthrough likely to shore up @entity129 's pro-engagement platform , providing a greater incentive for the supreme leader , ayatollah @entity137 , to relinquish some control of @entity8 's foreign policy to @entity129 's more moderate camp			2
ultimately , there is far more at stake in the ongoing talks with @entity8 than just the crucial nuclear issues being discussed			2
@entity29 thrives on slaughter in @entity26 , but a political solution for the war - ravaged country has so far proven elusive			0
a final accord to rein in @entity8 's nuclear program could bring diplomatic options to stabilize the @entity11 that were never previously on the table .			1
