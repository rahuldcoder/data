-- @entity1 has been asked to return all prize money from his seven annulled @entity4 victories by the sport 's governing body , who confirmed the history books will show no winner of the famous race between 1999 - 2005			1
the disgraced @entity11 operated " the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen , " according to the @entity12 ( @entity12 )			2
at a meeting at their @entity18 headquarters , the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) also announced an independent commission would examine its handling of the @entity1 case			1
the 41 - year - old is still to comment on claims he consistently used performance enhancing drugs throughout his career , though he has decided not to contest the case			0
in a written response , @entity1 's office asserts that witness testimony to @entity12 is contradictory to prior testimony ; that witnesses testified only after @entity1 decided not to contest the @entity12 proceeding ; and that @entity12 offered sweetheart deals to active riders in exchange for their testimony			1
but the @entity15 is determined to pursue him for the riches he received as a result of his seven straight victories in cycling 's most prestigious race , while confirming the record books will be left blank			1
a statement on the @entity15 's official website read : " with respect to @entity1 and the implications of the @entity12 sanctions which it endorsed on monday 22 october , the @entity45 decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events			1
" the committee decided to apply this ruling from now on to any competitive sporting results disqualified due to doping for the period from 1998 to 2005 , without prejudice to the statute of limitation			2
" @entity61 ( @entity15 ) has asked @entity1 to return all the prize money he won from his seven @entity4 victories , that have been struck off due to allegations of doping			1
" the @entity66 acknowledged that a cloud of suspicion would remain hanging over this dark period -- but that while this might appear harsh for those who rode clean , they would understand there was little honor to be gained in reallocating places			1
" the @entity15 and its president @entity73 has come under fire for not picking up @entity1 's doping , despite testing him over 200 times			1
there are also question marks about a $ 100,000 donation from @entity1 to the @entity15 in 2002 , revealed in @entity12 's report , but @entity73 insists there was no cover up in regard to @entity1 's activities			1
@entity86 winner @entity85 called on @entity73 and the @entity15 's honorary president @entity87 to resign over their handling of the case			2
he said the pair had abused their power and that cycling would not be able to move on unless they were to quit			0
the @entity15 declined to comment on the story when contacted by @entity0			0
@entity85 's views were echoed by @entity98 , a former cyclist with the @entity100 team before @entity1 joined them , who claims he quit the sport after being asked to use banned substances			2
he told @entity0 : " the sport is going to have some tough times and i think there needs to be a leadership change for it to really be able to move forward			0
" the leadership needs to be held accountable ; if you look at the business world the ceo would either resign or be fired			0
the management committee did not do that			0
it is still the same guys who were there during this and i do n't think it 's nearly enough			0
" the @entity15 said it would soon appoint a fully independent external commission that would look into the role it played during the @entity1 affair and report no later than june next year			2
it has also decided to suspend legal action against former @entity125 journalist @entity124 who accused them , as well as @entity127 and @entity87 , of corruption , until after the commission reports			1
@entity73 said in the same @entity15 statement that it was " determined to turn around this painful episode in the history of our sport			0
" " we will take whatever actions are deemed necessary by the independent commission and we will put cycling back on track , " he added			0
" today , cycling is a completely different sport from what it was in the period 1998 - 2005			0
riders are now subject to the most innovative and effective anti-doping procedures and regulations in sport			0
" nevertheless , we have listened to the world 's reaction to the @entity1 affair and have taken these additional decisive steps in response to the grave concerns raised			2
