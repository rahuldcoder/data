-- @entity1 was always watching			1
his contemporaries remember him forever on the spot , four or five cameras draped around his neck , the proverbial fly on the wall			0
a new book , " @entity10 : @entity13 , " shows how he chronicled an era			1
click : @entity15 at @entity16			1
click , click , click : the @entity18 at @entity19 , the @entity20 on a rooftop , the @entity17 casually jamming			0
@entity1 is justifiably famous for these photos of the famous			1
but it was n't like he put away his cameras when the rock stars -- then , for the most part , just getting more widely known -- put away their instruments			2
" @entity10 " showcases pictures @entity1 took from about 1965 to 1968 , when @entity10 went from a quietly run - down fringe area to the most famous neighborhood in @entity31 : @entity32			1
for @entity1 , it was also home			1
" he lived in the @entity10			1
he was at ground zero , " says @entity35 , @entity1 's longtime assistant , who now oversees the estate of the late photographer			1
( @entity1 died in 2010			1
) " so much happened in a short period of time , and @entity1 saw that			1
" the book 's earlier images show a neighborhood on the verge of change			1
in 1965 , @entity10 was a mixed - race enclave of cheap apartments and old @entity51 houses , home to working - class laborers and beat artists looking for inexpensive digs			1
the countercultural bent started early : in one photo , residents are shown protesting the @entity59 at a time when the war was barely a blip on the national radar			0
suddenly the music scene took over , exemplified by the @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and the @entity68			0
the @entity68 , who dressed as @entity70 swells , were probably the most deliberately colorful , but it was the other bands who became the legends			0
@entity1 's eye was able to find the energy in musicians without being sentimental			1
the @entity18 , shot at their last @entity31 concert , are caught backstage , pensive and bored ; in one photo , @entity79 doodles on a table while @entity81 smiles into @entity1 's lens			1
in others , @entity14 comes across as innocent and ferocious -- and , sometimes , heartbreakingly sad			2
@entity1 is no less unsparing when shooting the neighborhood , which became a destination for tourists and dropouts			1
one photo shows a family of six driving through , their car windows safely rolled up as if in protection against long hair			0
another shows an inoculation being given at the @entity95			0
as @entity67 's @entity98 says in the book , " i had about two weeks that were really happy			2
after that , it faded pretty quickly			0
the @entity103 ( tour buses were ) going up the street			0
" @entity1 got such access because he was a part of the scene			2
he did n't just take the @entity18 ' picture ; he hung out with them			0
he went to @entity16 , the groundbreaking 1967 music festival , because he was pals with many of the acts			0
" a lot of the musicians really knew that @entity1 was n't taking advantage of them			2
he was there documenting what was happening , and that 's why he was able to get such great shots , " says @entity117			0
amazingly , @entity1 's photographs were done on manually operated @entity123 -- no autofocus , no special lighting , certainly no @entity126			2
" he was able to compose that shot , in a second , within that viewfinder , and he never cropped his photos , " @entity117 says			0
" that just tells you his genius			0
" these days , when the @entity134 has become a gentrified stretch of expensive apartments and exclusive boutiques , @entity1 's photographs are even more striking			2
they show bands on the rise , streets in flux , a time being born -- and , just as quickly , fading away			0
his lens , " @entity10 " shows , missed little			2
" he was everywhere , " says @entity117 .			0
