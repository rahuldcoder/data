the effort to drill through more than 2,300 feet ( 700 meters ) of rock and safely extract the workers could take three to four months , officials said			1
the hole under way is the excavation hole , where the drill bit will be placed			2
the miners have been stuck in the desert copper - and - gold mine since an august 5 cave - in and are surviving on supplies funneled to them from above ground through three bore holes , each about 4 inches in diameter			1

all the family members said the miners appeared to be in much better condition , much cleaner and much better organized than they appeared during the first video , which was sent up last thursday			1
most appeared stripped to the waist and bearded in the first video ; some had shaved and were modeling high - tech sportswear -- t - shirts and shorts -- that were sent down to them this week			1
the video showed the miners with photographs their relatives have sent down to them in recent days			1

" @entity86 , the 70 - year - old father of @entity87 , himself a veteran miner , said of his son , " i was a little worried because i did n't see him much in the video			2
i think , if they have a problem , they steer clear of the video			2
but then again , he 's a bit like me			0
he does n't like cameras too much			0
" the camera , just two inches wide , fits easily through the 4 - inch bore hole , has front and side views and can rotate 360 degrees , said @entity103 , a product manager with a @entity105 , @entity106 - based subsidiary of @entity98 " it 's able to get into very small openings , " he said			1

wednesday 's menu will include rice and shredded beef or pork , the first hot meal the men will have had since they became trapped nearly a month ago , said @entity135 , a medic involved in the miners ' care			2
though the dishes are normally served with beans in @entity1 , @entity135 said they would not be included , so that the men -- who are living in close quarters -- can avoid getting intestinal gas			0

@entity177 , quality control and risk manager for the @entity1 mining company @entity180 , has said his company was bringing a specialized device typically used for boring water holes to the mine			0
