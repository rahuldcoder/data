@entity0 , @entity1 -- who is stealing -- and crashing -- airplanes in @entity1 ? police say they found this self - portrait of @entity7 in the deleted file of a stolen digital camera			1
the 18 - year - old man police call the prime suspect does not have a pilot 's license			1
but he does have a nickname -- " the @entity16 " -- and a @entity18 fan club , which compares him to @entity20 " without the murders " and exhorts : " fly , @entity22 , @entity23 " police say @entity7 has been linked to crimes in five counties involving planes , luxury cars and boats			1
he 's known to alternate between squatting in vacant vacation homes , which he allegedly burglarizes , and roughing it in the woods			2
since november , police say , at least three small , private planes have been stolen and flown away			1
the latest to go missing crash - landed last week in a clearing in @entity40 , @entity1 , after running out of fuel , police said			1
the rough landing damaged the @entity43 182 , which along with its instruments is worth more than $ 500,000			2
but authorities said the plane 's pilot appears to have walked away unhurt			2
@entity7 has not been charged in any of the plane thefts			1
but authorities are testing vomit found in the cockpit of one plane to see whether they can place the teen inside			2
@entity7 has been on authorities ' radar for years			1
" @entity22 , " as he is called , was first arrested for burglary at age 12 , said detective @entity58 , a spokesman for the @entity59			2
the break - in at a local school earned @entity7 a few weeks in a juvenile facility , @entity58 said			1
local media reports tally nine arrests for @entity7 before the age of 15			1
now police in five counties in @entity1 are looking for him			1
@entity7 dropped out of high school and , according to @entity58 , police believe he spent his teens burglarizing unoccupied homes on @entity72 , a vacation community of about 15,000 people off the @entity1 coast			1
he became known as " the @entity16 , " because , investigators say , he preferred to prowl shoeless			1
gradually , @entity58 alleges , @entity7 moved onto more sophisticated crimes			1
" he will typically break into a home or vehicle and copy down the credit card numbers , " @entity58 said			0
" he then leaves the credit cards behind so people do n't realize they have been stolen			0
" @entity58 said @entity7 has charged thousands of dollars worth of video games , gps devices and police scanners online , using stolen credit cards			1
when @entity7 was n't squatting in homes , he took to the woods with survival gear to elude police			1
he 's been known to hide in the trees			0
" he 's almost like a feral child , " @entity58 said			0
@entity7 's days of running from authorities on the 40 - square - mile island appeared to end in 2007 when he was arrested and pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary			1
@entity58 said some of the charges were dismissed as part of the guilty plea			0
less than a year later , @entity58 said , @entity7 allegedly walked away from a juvenile halfway house			1
police on @entity72 again began receiving reports of thefts that fit @entity7 's profile , @entity58 said			1
in 2008 , a deputy said he spotted @entity7 in a stolen @entity107 , but he lost the suspect when he allegedly dove from the moving vehicle			1
after the chase , police recovered a stolen digital camera from the car			2
@entity58 said he found a deleted self - portrait of @entity7 , who posed in a shirt with a telltale @entity107 insignia			1
the shirt also belonged to the vehicle 's owner			0
@entity7 faces 10 counts in that case , as well as other thefts , internet crimes and burglaries , @entity58 said			1
charges are expected soon in a dozen more cases			0
@entity7 dropped from sight for a while when wanted posters of him went up around @entity72			2
soon , though , authorities in the @entity131 noticed a series of break - ins and wondered whether @entity7 was island - hopping			1
the theft of a @entity43 182 from the @entity131 in november jogged @entity58 's memory			0
he recalled what he had found on a computer he said @entity7 used			2
" he had looked at flight manuals and how to fly a plane , " he said			0
another theft of a small experimental plane had been reported in september			2
@entity143 , undersheriff of @entity144 , said police do n't think the two thefts are a coincidence			2
" this does n't happen here , that 's why we think they go together , " he said			0
police consider @entity7 to be a fugitive			1
even though @entity7 has no known flight training , @entity143 said police are certain he is their mystery pilot			1
@entity7 's mother doubts her son learned to fly on his own			2
" any time anything is stolen , they blame it on @entity22 , " @entity159 told the @entity161 newspaper			0
" let 's say you 're the smartest person in the world			0
would n't you need a little bit of training in flying a plane ? they 're not easy			0
" @entity2 attempted to contact @entity159 , but her phone was disconnected			0
@entity2 also tried to reach a former attorney for @entity7 but the lawyer has not returned calls requesting comment			2
experts said that teaching oneself to fly is difficult but not impossible			0
" it 's been heard of , " said flight instructor @entity178			0
" let 's face it , the @entity183 were able to teach themselves			0
landing would be the hardest part , but if you were n't too concerned about using the plane again , it could be done			0
" meanwhile , authorities in @entity191 are investigating whether @entity7 stole a boat and used it to reach @entity193 , where burglaries at three vacation homes have recently been reported , deputy @entity189 said			1
@entity193 , a small peninsula , is @entity196 territory but is accessible only from the water or through @entity198			0
from parts of @entity193 , entering @entity198 is just a matter of crossing the street			0
last week , law enforcement agencies got a new lead when a private plane was stolen in @entity205 , @entity206 , just across the border from @entity198			0
residents noticed a plane flying at an altitude of 100 feet as it left the area on tuesday , said detective @entity212			0
the plane was found thursday , crashed and out of fuel in a patch of cleared forest in @entity40 , @entity1			2
on sunday , authorities say they received a report of a burglary			0
" blankets , shoes and food [ were ] taken instead of big - ticket items like @entity226 , " said sheriff 's spokeswoman @entity220			0
a gunshot rang out as deputies searched the woods and came across some of the stolen items , @entity220 said			0
no one was injured , but the swat team was called in			0
police searched the area , using a helicopter with an infrared heat detection scanner and another @entity238 provided by the @entity239			0
low - tech police work led to @entity7 's arrest in 2005			1
police staked out his mother 's house , waiting until someone inside ordered a pizza			0
police rode in the delivery car to the house and waited for @entity7 to come to them .			1
