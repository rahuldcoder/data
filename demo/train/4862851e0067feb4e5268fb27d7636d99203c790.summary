-- the @entity1 , @entity2 , sheriff and other officials are to hold a town hall meeting tuesday night about what will become of the house that 's the site of the nation 's largest cache of homemade explosives ever found in one spot			1
for now , the single - story suburban house in an unincorporated area outside @entity16 has been deemed too dangerous for bomb squad technicians to re-enter after they discovered homemade explosives inside last week , officials said			1
eight or 9 pounds of explosives were found in the backyard after a gardener was injured when he accidentally ignited the material almost two weeks ago			2
it has been cordoned off , but residents are concerned about how authorities plan to secure a house that a prosecutor has described as a bomb - making factory			2
the house 's resident , @entity29 , 54 , a computer software consultant , is being held in lieu of $ 5 million bail on bomb - making and bank robbery charges			1
the homemade explosives are volatile and are the kind favored by terrorists worldwide : hexamethylene triperoxide diamine , or @entity40 , and pentaerythritol tetranitrate , or @entity42 , which is now the target of new @entity44 airport body scans and pat downs			1
authorities are investigating @entity29 's intentions			0
exacerbating the work of the bomb squad is the overwhelming volume of clutter that indicates @entity29 was a hoarder of papers , boxes and other items , officials said			1
friction from moving any papers or boxes could cause hidden explosives to ignite , officials said			2
authorities have removed about 9 pounds of @entity40 from the backyard , a quantity that one expert likened to a large car bomb that could blow out the house 's windows and doors and damage adjacent houses			2
@entity71 lives about 100 yards from the hazardous home , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity73			0
she received a reverse 911 call earlier tuesday , warning her of potential activity around the residence , but has not been asked to evacuate			0
" it 's not a convenient time			0
but i do n't think there 's any convenient time for having explosives next door to where you live , " she told @entity73			0
on tuesday afternoon , assistant @entity86 @entity85 declined to provide details of officials ' presentation for the town hall meeting , scheduled to start at 7 p.m. pt at @entity92 in @entity93			1
sheriff @entity94 , @entity16 police chief @entity95 , @entity16 fire chief @entity96 and other public safety officials were to answer questions from residents about the explosives and hazardous chemicals that remain in the house , and authorities will provide information about personal safety regarding the planned disposal of the volatile materials			1
the additional hmtd discovered inside the house last week is in a bottle , @entity85 said			2
@entity42 was also found inside the house , officials said			1
" we have not removed it yet			0
it 's too dangerous to move			0
any movement can set it off , " @entity85 said			0
" we have a saying : we 'll go as fast as we can but slow as we must , " he added .			0
