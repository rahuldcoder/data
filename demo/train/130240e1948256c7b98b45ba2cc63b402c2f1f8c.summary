-- a day after @entity1 @entity2 announced greater political participation for women in the future , some @entity1 questioned just how big a change may really be on the horizon			1
some women 's rights activists who were initially elated by sunday 's announcement said they were feeling disappointed because the changes do not kick in immediately			1
" we do n't really think now that we 've been promised a real right , " said one			1
but a member of @entity1 's @entity15 called one of the changes the king announced " hugely important			1
" @entity2 announced two changes sunday , which would be historic for @entity1			1
he said women will be allowed to serve as members of the @entity22 , the @entity15 that advises the king			1
its 150 members are appointed			0
the king also said women will be allowed to run as candidates and nominate candidates in the next set of municipal elections			2
it is unknown when those may ultimately take place			0
the changes do not apply to elections scheduled for this thursday -- which will be only the second set of elections in the kingdom since 1963			0
while the king did not use the word " vote " in his remarks , allowing women to take part in the nomination process would amount to voting within @entity1 's system			1
" we do n't really think now that we 've been promised a real right because it 's been postponed			1
" said @entity50 , a prominent @entity1 women 's rights activist			1
" the king could have said this is happening now because the next election is going to happen this thursday -- it would n't have been a problem to postpone this election for a month and have women participate in this round			2
" " for the shura council it 's another year and a half , for the municipal election it 's another four years -- anything could happen during that time , " she said			2
" whatever can be given can be taken			0
" " that will give time for extremists to reverse the decision , " said @entity65			0
" the government thinks they will give time for people to adjust to the idea , but if you 're against something , you 'll never change your mind and if you 're for it you 'll never change your mind			0
why do they hesitate when it comes to women 's issues ? the government always hesitates			1
" this thursday 's elections come after more than two years of delays , so any time frame for when future elections may take place is not seen as a solid plan			2
@entity90 said the announcement that women will be given the right to vote is " no guarantee of rights			1
" " it is a welcome , albeit limited , step along the long road towards gender equality in @entity1 , and a testament to the long struggle of women 's rights activists there , " said @entity97 , the human rights group 's deputy director for the @entity99 and @entity100 , in a statement			1
" it is , however , much overdue and does not go nearly far enough			0
" " the whole system of women 's subordination to men in @entity1 needs to be dismantled , " @entity97 said			1
@entity112 , one of the 150 members of the @entity15 , expressed no doubts that women will join the council in 2013 , and called it a very significant step			1
" i think it 's hugely important , " he said			1
" they will be full members of the @entity22 just like anybody else			0
we have women advisers , but in the next round of @entity22 appointments , they will be full members of the committee just like any other member			2
" the @entity128 notes that there are 13 advisers on the council			0
@entity112 said the 13 advise the council , but are not among the 150 members			0
the changes the king announced follow increasing pressure , from outside and inside @entity1 , to give women the right to vote and greater political participation			1
earlier this year , @entity1 women activists wrote the government requesting that women be allowed to vote and be candidates in the municipal elections , according to the @entity146 @entity145			1
@entity1 's " minister of municipality and rural affairs declared that @entity1 women will not be able to either run or vote in this election , " the @entity145 reported on its blog			1
" according to news reports , the minister stated that the ban on women 's participation is due to the lack of segregated voting facilities			1
" when election centers opened in april for voters to register , some groups of women turned up and were turned away			2
it was one of the first public acts of the " @entity164 , " a movement set up to campaign for the end of @entity1 's discriminatory laws			2
in june , a number of @entity1 women took to the streets -- in cars -- to demand the right for women to drive and travel freely in the country			1
there are no specific traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in @entity1			2
however , religious edicts are often interpreted as a prohibition of female drivers			0
such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts , obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian			0
authorities stopped @entity189 , 32 , for driving a car may 21 and detained her the next day			0
she said she was forced to sign a form promising not to drive again and spent a week in jail			0
her case became a rallying cry for women activists			0
the @entity128 's human rights report on @entity1 , published in 2011 , notes many challenges facing women in @entity1 in 2010 : " by law a female rape victim is at fault for illegal ' mixing of genders ' and is punished along with the perpetrator			1
" " women continued to face discrimination under the law and remained uninformed about their rights			2
although they may legally own property and are entitled to financial support from their guardian , women have few political or social rights , and society does not treat them as equal members			2
" " the guardianship system requires that every woman have a close male relative as her ' guardian ' with the authority to approve her travel			0
" " women risk arrest for riding in a vehicle driven by a male who is not an employee or a close male relative			0
" " women also faced discrimination in courts , where the testimony of one man equals that of two women			0
" " the law requires a woman to obtain the permission of a male guardian to work if the type of business is not ' deemed appropriate for a woman			0
' " the report also noted some improvements			0
" increased efforts to protect women and children against domestic violence through the @entity247 , as well as the @entity248 , reflected a significant human rights achievement , " the report said			2
it also noted that in 2010 , " women increasingly participated in political life , albeit with significantly less status than men			0
" @entity0 's @entity255 and @entity256 contributed to this report .			0
