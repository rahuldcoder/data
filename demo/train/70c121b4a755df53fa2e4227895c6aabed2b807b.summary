as a teenager in war - ravaged @entity2 , @entity0 was brainwashed , drugged and forced to kill			1
" we went from children who were afraid of gunshots to now children who were gunshots , " says @entity0 who became separated from his family at just 12 years old when his town was attacked			1
he says his family were later killed in the country 's vicious civil war , which lasted from 1991 to 2002			1
during this period rebel groups like the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) -- who were notorious for hacking off limbs and indoctrinating children into their struggle -- fought government forces and their offshoots for control of the diamond rich @entity24 state			2
desperate for help , @entity0 says he wandered the countryside with a group of other children who had lost their families in similar circumstances			1
they managed to avoid the roaming @entity14 rebels but witnessed gunfights , ransacked villages and countless dead bodies along the way			0
" i saw a man carrying his son that had been shot dead , but he was trying to run with him to the hospital , " @entity0 recalls			2
" ( there was also ) this woman had been running and she had a baby that was tied on her back			0
she 'd been running away from the fighting and the bullet had struck the baby and the baby had been killed but she did n't know			0
" eventually @entity0 and his friends came across a rural camp they initially believed to be an army base			2
they soon realized however that they had in fact stumbled upon a battalion of breakaway @entity2 soldiers			1
the splinter group opposed the @entity14 but were pursuing similarly vicious fighting tactics , including the deployment of child soldiers			1
@entity0 was taken in , given shelter and eventually trained to kill			2
" somebody being shot in front of you , or you yourself shooting somebody became just like drinking a glass of water			0
children who refused to fight , kill or showed any weakness were ruthlessly dealt with			2
" emotions were n't allowed , " he continued			0
" for example a nine - year - old boy cried because they missed their mother and they were shot , " he says of the era which was portrayed in the 2006 @entity77 film " @entity80 , " starring @entity78 and @entity79			0
see also : @entity87 child soldier turned @entity88 speaking about the moment he became separated from his family , @entity0 recalls : " i had gone to a talent show , i was interested in @entity93 hip - hop music , with my older brother , to another town and my town was attacked			1
i went from having an entire family to the next minute not having anything			0
" now a @entity101 goodwill ambassador , a law graduate and a best - selling author , @entity0 is heading the fight to publicize the plight of child soldiers in @entity107			1
" i do work with @entity108 to go to some of these places , but also to meet the young people who are coming from these experiences to reassure them that it is possible to come out of this , " he says			2
" i can speak to these children			2
with proper integration this is the way you can have a successful removal of children from armed groups " see also : former child soldier remembers @entity0 says he now has a greater understanding as to why children are viewed as such valuable fighting assets to groups like the @entity14 across @entity107			1
according to the @entity101 there remains an estimated 300,000 children involved in conflicts around the world today			1
" everybody always asks why do they go after children ? because you can easily manipulate them , " he says			0
" they also want to belong to something , especially if they live in a society that has collapsed completely			0
their communities are broken down , they want to belong to anything slightly organized and these groups become that			0
" @entity0 felt this acceptance in his division of child soldiers and fought with the group for two years before eventually being rescued by @entity108			1
he was taken to a rehab center in the @entity2 capital , @entity151 , where he spent eight months learning about what happened to him and readjusting to life after the war			1
those who worked at the center were frequently attacked by child soldiers finding it difficult to adapt to their new surroundings in the early days			1
" we were very angry			0
we destroyed the center where we were staying at ( and ) we burned some things up , " he says of his early months there			0
" we beat up the staff members			0
they came back , we beat them up some more			0
" with time , and the patience of a carer named nurse @entity168 , however , @entity0 says he was eventually able to reconnect to his lost childhood and remember the person he once was			2
he also credits the hip - hop music he loved as an innocent 12 - year - old and the songs of @entity174 as a major help in his recovery			0
see also : from child soldier to child savior @entity0 's progress was so impressive that in 1996 he was selected to go to the @entity101 and speak to a conference led by @entity181 , @entity182 's wife , on the plight of child soldiers			1
it was during this trip that he would meet @entity187 -- a @entity108 worker who would eventually adopt him and bring him to @entity93 when the conflict in @entity2 escalated to engulf @entity151 in 1998			1
upon moving to the @entity93 , @entity0 enrolled at the @entity101 school in @entity190 before going on to graduate in 2004 with a degree in political science from @entity194 in @entity195			1
during his studies he also wrote a book on his experiences as a youth in @entity2 , " @entity200 : @entity201 "			2
" i finished this book before i graduated			0
i never intended to publish it but the idea for writing it was really this desire to just find a way to give the human context that was missing in the way the issue of child soldiers were discussed , " he says			1
his passion for bringing a greater understanding to the experiences of child soldiers has since led @entity215 to his current role as a @entity101 ambassador for children affected by war			1
and he hopes to offer the same support to today 's child soldiers as nurse @entity168 and the staff at the @entity151 rehab center offered him			1
" i witness @entity108 workers doing all of this and when these children were removed i felt their confusion , " he says			0
" i 've been in that place before			0
all of a sudden you no longer have your military gear , you 're now a kid			0
" " what i 'm saying to them is that everybody has the capacity to find their own talent with the right opportunities to do something more with their lives , and everybody can walk their own path			0
