@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 held a town hall meeting saturday with a group of young people in the @entity8 section of @entity0 , with video links to similar groups in other cities in @entity1			1
here are five things that he said in response to questions from the participants in a format he called " a little humbling " but energizing			2
@entity2 @entity0 correspondent @entity18 moderated the town hall			2
praise for @entity21 @entity3 paid homage to former @entity1 president @entity21 , the 94 - year - old founding father of the country 's modern democracy who is in critical condition in a @entity27 hospital			1
" obviously , he is on our minds today , and we join the people of the world in sending our prayers to @entity21 and his family , because he still inspires us all , " @entity3 said , referring to @entity21 by his clan name			1
@entity3 noted that @entity21 held on to his optimism during his 27 years in prison under @entity1 's apartheid regime , and he urged his audience to learn from that			1
" there will be time to test your faith , but no matter how old you grow , i say ... do n't lose those qualities of youth : your imagination , your optimism , your idealism , ' cause the future of this continent is in your hands , and if you keep your head pointed toward the sun , and you keep your feet moving forward , i promise you will have no better friend and partner than the @entity57			1
" @entity21 showed that " through a commitment to the constitution and rule of law and equal treatment for all people that a country can prosper despite a tragic history			0
" @entity3 meets with @entity21 's family in @entity1 a bright view of @entity1 's future @entity1 's role in the world economy as a provider of raw materials to other parts of the world dates back to colonial days and must be changed , @entity3 said			1
though foreign aid remains critical in some parts of the continent , " it is very clear that people want to break out of a dependency trap			1
the idea is not that @entity1 should be the ward of some other country			0
what we need is an @entity1 that 's building , manufacturing , creating value , inventing and then sending those products around the world and receiving products in return			2
... if we do that , there 's no reason why @entity1 can not succeed			2
" progress against terrorism though " some progress " has been made in dealing with extremist groups , " the problem has metastasized " to include more regional terrorist organizations such as @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity3 said			1
" though they may not have the same transnational capacity that some of the earlier organizations did , they 're doing great harm in @entity1 and in the @entity108 and in @entity109			0
" the terrorist threat affects more than @entity112 countries , he said			0
" the number of people killed by terrorist attacks in @entity1 or @entity109 far outstrips deaths by @entity117 , " he said			0
" this is not just a problem for us ; this is a problem for everybody			0
" terrorism is more likely to emerge in countries that are not delivering for their people , " and where there are areas of conflict and underlying frustrations " that have not been adequately dealt with , he said			0
he cited responsive governance and strong democratic institutions as bulwarks against terrorism taking root			0
" they 're the most important defense against terrorism			0
" @entity57 ambitions @entity3 rejected " this notion that we want to somehow expand our military reach , " citing the end of the war in @entity143 and plans to end the war in @entity145 as evidence			1
" this idea somehow that we want to get more involved militarily around the world is simply not true , " he said			0
" first of all , it costs a lot of money , and the @entity57 -- just like every country around the world -- has to think about its budget			1
and where we intervene , oftentimes it 's not very effective because , unless you 've got a local population that is standing up against terrorism , we end up being viewed as interlopers and intruders			2
" he said he wants the @entity167 and other regional organizations to beef up their capacity to send peacekeepers " to nip terror cells that may be forming -- before they start and gain strength			0
" the @entity57 , he added , can provide advice , training and , in some cases , equipment			2
global warming looms the world 's biggest environmental challenge is climate change , @entity3 said , adding that carbon emissions are warming the planet and threaten to cause the problem to spin out of control			1
" we are going to all have to work together to find ways in which , collectively , we reduce carbon , " but wealthy countries must do more than companies that are still developing , he said			0
" obviously , they should n't be resigned to poverty simply because the @entity194 and @entity195 and @entity57 got there first			1
that would n't be fair , but everybody 's going to have to do something			2
" if , however , everyone buys cars , installs air conditioners and moves into big houses , " the planet will boil over unless we find new ways of producing energy , " he said .			0

" do n't lose those qualities of youth , " president @entity3 urges his audience
@entity214 want to break out of the " dependency trap , " he says
wars cost " a lot of money , " says @entity3 , *downplaying* @entity57 military ambitions
" everybody 's going to have to do something " on climate change , he says
