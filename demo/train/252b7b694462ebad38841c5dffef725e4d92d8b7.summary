-- the introductions at @entity2 , the largest conference in the world for women in social media , tend to go something like this : " @entity12 , so great to meet you , " i said to a blogger whom i knew only by her @entity11 handle			1
" @entity14 , great to meet you too , " she replied , using my @entity11 handle			0
that type of exchange happens hundreds , maybe thousands , of times at this conference , which opened friday in @entity20			1
the chance to meet online connections in person is part of the reason women from all over the world gather for the two - day event			1
they also come to network , build potential business partnerships and burnish their brands overall			0
" @entity33 " @entity34 expects to meet at least 200 people this year , her third @entity2 conference			1
she 'll contact many of them when she returns home to continue networking and building upon common interests			1
" it just is an opportunity to open a door that you would n't have if you did n't come to a @entity2 conference , " said @entity34 , a mother of two from @entity43 whose blog focuses on simplifying technology for women			1
for first - time @entity2 attendees like @entity20 @entity52 , the goal is to build her blog , for love of cupcakes , into a full - time job that she can run as a " work - at - home mom			1
" " i 'm hoping to just keep growing to where it can be a part - time income or eventually a full - time income , " said @entity59 , the mother of a 2 - year - old girl , who works outside the home as a day - care teacher			1
@entity2 is more than a conference			1
it 's also a major cross-platform business that hosts 3,000 blogs and helps many more expand their reach through education and networking opportunities			1
the @entity2 publishing network has generated $ 25 million for about 5,000 female writers over the past four years , said @entity2 co-founder @entity76			0
most bloggers use this income to support their work and pay for business expenses ; others use it to supplement their household income and support their families , she said			1
businesses understand the power of female bloggers , judging by the more than 130 brands -- from @entity88 to @entity89 -- in attendance			1
and yet , mainstream media seem to marginalize what these women are doing			1
take a @entity95 story this year that depicted blogger conferences as opportunities for women to party away from their husbands and kids			1
" the sheer power of women on the @entity109 is so clear statistically , and yet there is some ongoing prevailing effort to belittle that leadership , " @entity102 said , citing stats showing women are 41 % more likely to use social media than men			1
" good luck trying to put women who blog into a bell jar , " @entity102 said			2
" they are going to ooze right out over the top and explode right in your face			0
" still , among the public , there seems to be a lack of understanding of what a blogger is , says @entity126 , a mom of three boys and host of @entity129			0
@entity126 , who is speaking on a panel this weekend , said she recently attended an event sponsored by the @entity132 where no one seemed to understand what she did as a blogger			0
it 's the same response she says she gets when she reveals her profession to people at airports or in the doctor 's office			2
" i think there 's just a misconception about what bloggers do			1
they all think we 're either like @entity150 or whatever random mommy blogger that they have read about on @entity153 , " the @entity146 , @entity147 , mom said			0
" so i think it 's up to us to sort of work really hard to change that perception , " she said			2
" hopefully other people will start to give the career a little more credence			0
" the @entity162 , now in its ninth year and profiled recently in @entity163 , aims to help by bringing attention to what female bloggers do			2
big - name speakers also help			2
last year , president @entity168 gave a keynote via video conference			2
this year 's closing keynote speaker is @entity172 , chief operating officer of @entity173 and author of the much - talked - about book " @entity176			1
" @entity177 may not understand the power and influence of bloggers			2
but parents who share tips about products or advice for getting kids to behave see the blog community as an extension of those support networks , said @entity34			0
there is another power that has nothing to do with educating the public			0
it has to do with women connecting with other women in ways they ca n't connect with their friends			2
first - time conference attendee @entity198 hosts the blog it 's a @entity201 , based on her love of the @entity203			1
she suffered from postpartum depression after her daughter was born			0
the women she met online , many of whom she is meeting for the first time at @entity2 , saved her , she says			2
" when i had postpartum depression , there was nobody in my physical life at that point in time who could say ' i know what you went through , ' " @entity210 said			0
through the @entity2 community , she met others who could relate to what she was going through and shared their experiences on their blogs			0
" you can say , ' look at this mother			0
she made her way through this , ' " she said			0
" i feel like that right now , and i can get through that			0
i can get to that point , too			0
" the value of such a connection ? priceless .			0
