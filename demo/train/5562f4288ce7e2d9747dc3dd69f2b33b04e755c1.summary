after years policing @entity3 streets for criminals , @entity1 is now among them -- and will be for more than three decades , a judge ruled thursday			1
will county judge @entity6 sentenced @entity1 to 38 years in prison in the murder of his third ex-wife , @entity9 , said state 's attorney spokesman @entity10			1
the former @entity13 - area police sergeant will get credit for the nearly four years that he has been in custody , according to @entity10 , a spokesman for @entity17 state 's attorney @entity16			1
he could have received as many as 60 years in prison ; @entity3 does not have a death penalty			1
" the reason that i never looked @entity1 in the eye is because i never acknowledged his existence , " said @entity16 , describing the convict as a " cold - blooded killer			1
" " but i looked him in the eye today , " the prosecutor said			0
" he knows that we did our job			0
" @entity1 was convicted of murder in september but had fought for a new trial , an effort that @entity6 denied thursday , just before the sentencing			1
@entity1 's lawyers promised thursday that they would press on with their appeal and expressed confidence they would prevail			1
they stood by their client , who defiantly claimed in court that he did n't kill @entity39			2
" would n't you be angry if you were wrongly convicted ? " said one of his attorneys , @entity40			2
" in this case , ( the prosecution ) changed everything ... how would you feel if you were railroaded ? " @entity39 was found dead in her dry , clean bathtub on march 1 , 2004			0
prosecutors said @entity1 killed her ; the defense contended that she fell , hit her head and drowned			1
the case did not grab headlines until after @entity1 's fourth wife , @entity56 , disappeared in october 2007			1
it was during the search for @entity59 -- who still has not been found -- that investigators said they 'd look again into @entity39 's death , which was initially ruled an accidental drowning			2
authorities altered their judgment and ruled @entity39 's death a homicide in february 2008 , setting the stage for the first - degree murder trial last year of @entity1 , a former police officer in @entity69 , @entity3			1
a @entity17 jury ultimately convicted him of murder after nearly 14 hours of deliberation			0
that was four months ago			0
on thursday , all the parties were back in court to see whether @entity1 would get a new trial or , if not , what his sentence would be			2
perhaps the most emotional part of this court proceeding was @entity1 's long and emotional remarks , which were interrupted at times by shouts from @entity39 family members , several of whom were asked to leave the courtroom			1
he unloaded " pent - up anger " that had built up over time -- against @entity39 and her family , the legal process , the media , even a tv movie about the case , according to his attorneys and the prosecutor			0
above all , @entity1 loudly insisted that he did not kill @entity39			2
why was he upset ? one of his lawyers , @entity97 , said part of it has to do with @entity1 feeling the system that he served -- as a military veteran and longtime police officer -- had failed him			1
" ( he is angry ) especially when you are somebody who has defended the @entity105 and served and protected the public , now being faced with the same system coming up and biting ( you ) in the butt , " @entity97 said			2
@entity109 , the state 's attorney , had a different take			0
he called @entity1 's remarks " pathetic , " especially in how he " attacked " @entity39 and her mental state			1
" just depraved , " the prosecutor said			0
" ... we all got an opportunity to see a psychopath reveal himself in open court			0
" it was a sentiment echoed by the victim 's sister , @entity122			0
she said she could n't stand to hear " the devil " demean her sister , almost nine years after her death			0
" he battered her to the very end			2
" @entity130 , a spokeswoman for @entity59 's family , lauded the prosecution for making " this world a safer , better place " by fighting to convict @entity1 and expressed hope he 'd next be held accountable for what happened to his fourth wife			1
" it 's not over for us , but of course , a win for the @entity39 family is a win for the @entity59 family , " @entity138 said			0
" we have a long journey ahead			0
we still want to see justice for @entity56			0
we wo n't give up			0
" several @entity39 family members specifically mentioned @entity56 when they addressed reporters late thursday afternoon in @entity149			0
@entity39 , a brother of @entity9 , said @entity59 's relatives " deserve the same thing that we 're getting right now : justice			1
" as to @entity1 's fate , @entity39 said he wanted him to " stay in jail forever , to die there			1
" " ( then ) he is going to go to hell , " the victim 's brother said			2
" and my sister is going to be watching him			0

@entity1 's lawyer says his client feels the system he served failed him
@entity9 's kin say he " battered her to the very end , " is " going to hell "
the @entity13 - area police sergeant was convicted of murdering his third wife
he is sentenced to 38 years in prison and will get credit for nearly 4 years served
