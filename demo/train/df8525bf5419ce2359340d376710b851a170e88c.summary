@entity13 has said she plans to introduce a bill in january that would place a ban on assault weapons			1
gun rights legislation gained renewed attention after an armed gunman killed 20 children and six adults in the @entity42 school shooting			1

the prohibition did not eliminate assault weapons , but restricted their features , limiting magazine capacity to 10 rounds and regulating pistol grips , bayonet attachments and flash suppressors			1

i also support restoring the gun ownership right for felons			0
provided the crime was nonviolent and not repeat offenders			0
i do think we need to address how firearms are stored and secured			0
we need to require owners to secure their weapons in such a way that makes them difficult to steal			2
i suggest gun safes and trigger locks			0
we need to do all we can to keep guns off the street			2
" @entity21 : why would someone own a military - style rifle ? @entity98 wrote , " this is absolutely the best response to the attack on civilian gun ownership that i 've seen in some time			0
" " i 'd stand , proudly , with this man in preserving our rights			0
he clearly understood his pledge to protect the @entity106 from all enemies , foreign and domestic and sounds like he 'll do it			0
i 'm right there with him ! " despite the number of mass shootings in the @entity14 in 2012 , @entity25 said he believes the laws already set in place for gun control are plenty			0
he adds that more laws will simply remove a means of defense for people			0

" she has the authority and responsibility to do just that until the people whom she represents decide otherwise through their votes			0
this gentleman believes that he is above the law			2
this is untrue ; in fact , my guess is that he swore to defend the country and respect its laws when he entered the @entity5			1
