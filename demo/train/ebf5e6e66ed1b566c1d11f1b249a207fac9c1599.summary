" if you just stick to it that the system will work , it 'll all come to light , everything will be fine			0
" instead , @entity19 was charged , ripped away from his boy , and put on trial			1

@entity19 's story , told in the @entity158 ' documentary " an @entity159 , " shines a spotlight on wrongful convictions in the @entity162			1
more than 2,000 wrongfully convicted people were exonerated between 1989 and 2012 , according to data compiled by the @entity165			2
but @entity19 's case has paved new ground that could affect cases nationwide			1
last month , @entity107 -- @entity19 's prosecutor who in 2001 became a judge -- pleaded no contest to a court order to show cause for withholding exculpatory evidence			1
a judgment of contempt from the clerk 's office of the 26th @entity179 , @entity27 , @entity28 , said the court found " @entity107 in criminal contempt of court on the matters set out in the show cause order ... " @entity107 's punishment pales in comparison to @entity19 's experience			1

he then served only five of those days , under @entity28 laws involving good behavior behind bars			2
he also agreed to a $ 500 fine , 500 hours of community service , and the loss of his law license , according to the @entity198 , a legal clinic affiliated with @entity201 's @entity200			2
it 's " an extremely rare instance , and perhaps the first time , that a prosecutor has been criminally punished for failing to turn over exculpatory evidence , " the @entity198 said			1
the " historic precedent demonstrates that when a judge orders a prosecutor to look in his file and disclose exculpatory evidence , deliberate failure to do so is punishable by contempt , " said @entity207 , the project 's co-director			1
the organization is working with the @entity215 and the @entity216 to coordinate a review of @entity107 's cases			2
@entity107 , meanwhile , has not publicly acknowledged any personal wrongdoing			0
in court , he said he could n't remember details of the case , and that he and his family have been through false accusations over it			0
" i apologize that the system screwed up			0
i 've beaten myself up on what i could have done different and i do n't know , " he said , acknowledging @entity19 's " pain			1
" @entity19 asked a judge to " do what needs to be done , but at the same time to be gentle with @entity231			1
" in prepared remarks outside the courthouse , @entity107 repeated that he wanted to " formally apologize for the system 's failure to mr. @entity19 and every other person who was affected by the verdict			1
" a statement released by @entity107 on thursday said , " this resolution resulted in a finding of contempt only			0
as stated on the record , this resolution did not involve any plea by mr. @entity107 to any criminal charge			0
" the former prosecutor also commented that he " hopes , for the sake of all persons involved , that this resolution brings an end to the tragic situation that began with the brutal murder of @entity137 in 1986 and that was followed by the incorrect conviction and incarceration of @entity19			1
mr. @entity107 continues to believe that mr. @entity19 's conviction resulted directly from a medical examiner 's assessment of @entity137 's time of death at 1:30 a.m. -- a time when mr. @entity19 was indisputably at home with his wife			1
regardless of the cause of the wrong result reached in the @entity19 trial , in light of the dna results obtained in 2011 , mr. @entity107 has consistently expressed -- and continues to express to mr. @entity19 and his family -- his regret for mr. @entity19 's prosecution and incorrect incarceration			1
" @entity19 now works on programs to help other innocent people behind bars			1
earlier this year , @entity28 gov. @entity276 signed the @entity277 into law , requiring prosecutors to turn evidence over to defense lawyers in criminal cases , upon the defendant 's request , without the need for a court order			1
the law will make the state 's criminal justice system " fairer and helping prevent wrongful convictions , " @entity276 said			0
' life has come full circle ' " other people often feel far more anger than i do , " @entity19 says			2
" @entity295 is very , very good , but it 's something i knew all along			0
... it 's really nothing new for me			0
" he had a religious epiphany in jail , and credits his newfound inner peace with the knowledge that @entity153 " loves me			0
" he 's now close with his son -- and daughter - in - law , and granddaughter , who is named after @entity23			1
" i 've never seen a more perfect child , " @entity19 says			1
" life has come full circle , " his son @entity71 says			0
" ... i do love him			0
" " the conundrums of life , the philosophical paradoxes , the metaphysical problems -- i feel like i get it now , " @entity19 says with a smile			2
" i understand suffering and unfairness			0
i ca n't think of anything better to receive than that			0
i 'm good with this			0
