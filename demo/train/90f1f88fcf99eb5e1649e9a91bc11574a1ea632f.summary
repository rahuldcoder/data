-- @entity2 steel , @entity4 maize , tea from @entity6 , palm oil from @entity8 -- myriad products are shipped through the @entity11 emirates			1
@entity12 wants and needs them all			2
but in the last few months , the growing web of @entity16 and @entity17 sanctions has begun to paralyze its ability to import and export key products			1
multiple banking , shipping and trade sources tell @entity0 that @entity12 is struggling to import staples and export crude oil as its access to the global financial system is curbed			1
as a result , inflation is rising and shortages of basic products are growing			1
take @entity12 's huge appetite for steel			1
normally , it imports about 300,000 tons of steel products a month from @entity2 alone , mainly for infrastructure and construction			0
" now it 's zero			0
it really is that bad , " said @entity39 , who follows the @entity2 steel industry for @entity41			0
@entity39 says that @entity2 , the main exporter of steel to @entity12 , has been exploring ways to get round the financing problems			2
in december , she said , " @entity2 and @entity12 trade envoys were discussing a ruble scheme , but so far nothing has been finalized			2
" most trade with @entity12 relies on letters of credit , and those are now routinely denied by banks anxious not to incur the wrath of the @entity56			2
a commercial source in @entity12 says one @entity59 metals company canceled letters of credit following the latest sanctions by @entity17 and the @entity16			1
it is now considering barter : steel for chemicals			0
imports of @entity4 maize are also caught in the financing squeeze			0
trade sources say thousands of tons are stuck in limbo between @entity4 and @entity12 ports , unloaded for lack of payment because @entity12 importers can not obtain letters of credit			1
@entity12 usually needs to import about 3.5 million tons of maize a year , according to figures from the @entity79 , but commodity traders report a sharp drop in shipments			1
there is no shortage of money in @entity12			2
export revenues have been buoyed by high oil prices , according to the @entity88			0
and by @entity11 standards , @entity12 has a diverse economy			0
the problem is financing , and the fear of being tainted by association with @entity12 's central bank or other financial entities			1
the scope of @entity16 sanctions is sweeping			1
those signed into law at the end of 2011 " require the president to block the property and interests in property subject to @entity16 jurisdiction of all @entity12 financial institutions , including the @entity104 ( ' @entity104 ' )			1
it also aims to reduce @entity12 oil revenues and discourage transactions with the @entity104 by providing for sanctions on foreign financial institutions that knowingly conduct or facilitate certain significant financial transactions with the @entity104			1
" few want to touch @entity12 crude a source familiar with the @entity16 sanctions strategy says banks have been made aware of the potential price of doing business with @entity12 -- even indirectly			1
in addition to the sanctions , the @entity56 has named @entity12 as a center of money laundering			1
it 's not just banks			0
international shipping companies are now much more reluctant to call at @entity12 ports or unload @entity12 oil			1
a @entity131 ban on imports of oil from @entity12 comes into effect in july , but the signing of new contracts was banned on january 23			1
in the @entity16 , legislation in @entity137 would ban from @entity16 ports any ship that has called at an @entity12 port in the preceding 180 days			1
one of the world 's major operators , @entity143 , has already suspended tanker deals with @entity12			1
@entity145 , an organization representing many of the world 's independent tanker owners , told @entity0 : " we are advising our members to comply with all sanctions at all times			0
" the consortium @entity153 , which has 45 of the largest crude carriers in its pool , decided that in view of the @entity131 measures and " other factors , including the inability of owners to maintain insurance cover while trading in @entity12 , @entity157 will no longer have any vessels ... trade to @entity12			2
" " @entity169 strictly complies with all sanctions and is not calling at @entity12 , " said @entity166 , ceo of @entity167 , another major shipper			2
picking up @entity12 crude " is like getting leprosy , " one shipping executive said			1
this month , at least two cargoes of @entity12 crude were sitting at the @entity176 terminal in @entity177 , but no one wanted to handle them for fear of falling foul of @entity17 sanctions , according to the leading industry publication @entity184			1
the @entity185 confirmed to @entity0 that in its latest @entity186 to clients , it has warned that " confusion over the likely implementation of @entity16 and @entity17 financial sanctions is causing marine insurers and ship - owners to be doubly cautious over the provision of [ insurance ] cover and the routes sailed			1
" confusion over sanctions @entity184 reports that @entity200 buyers of @entity12 crude are struggling to find vessels willing to call at @entity12 ports because of the lack of insurance cover , but it quotes industry sources as saying that @entity6 and @entity208 owners " have no issues " with loading @entity12 crude			1
perhaps most damaging to the @entity12 economy is the sharp decline in trade across the @entity11 from @entity212 and @entity213			0
banks in the @entity11 emirates have begun to halt the financing of exports to @entity12			0
about 8,000 @entity12 - owned trading firms have a presence in @entity213 , and the @entity220 as a whole re-exported about $ 9 billion in goods to @entity12 in the first nine months of last year , according to figures from @entity220 authorities			0
but without letters of credit , that volume has fallen sharply in recent months			0
imports of everything from machinery to rice are affected , even though sanctions do n't apply directly to such products			0
@entity234 , director of the @entity12 @entity235 based in @entity213 , told @entity0 last month that traders were going out of business , starved of finance			1
they 've also been hurt by the rapid depreciation of the @entity12 rial , now valued at " 17,000 rials when their calculations were based on 10,000 rials to the dollar , " @entity234 says			1
pending @entity16 legislation may further turn the screw			0
a bill that passed the @entity247 this month would ban any foreign bank from handling transactions by @entity12 oil companies and would seek to block @entity12 access to the system that enables international banking transactions			1
@entity255 action that system is called @entity255 , or the @entity255			0
based in @entity258 , it enables nearly 10,000 banks and financial institutions worldwide to do business			0
the bill would direct the @entity56 to put pressure on the banks that own @entity255 to exclude @entity12 entities			0
the @entity267 bill has to be reconciled with a similar measure that has passed the @entity269			0
the @entity12 economy can withstand sanctions , economic analysts say			2
@entity12 had foreign exchange reserves of about $ 80 billion in 2009 , according to the @entity88 , and does not carry huge debt			0
in addition , countries like @entity208 and @entity6 see an opportunity in continuing to trade with @entity12			0
@entity6 plans to send a large trade delegation to @entity279 later this month , insisting that it need only abide by @entity282 - approved sanctions against @entity12			2
in recent years , @entity12 banks have successfully moved away from the dollar to finance trade and turned instead to the euro			2
now , as sanctions multiply , that source is also drying up			0
@entity12 businesses will need time to develop alternative trading mechanisms , such as barter agreements or settling contracts in currencies such as the @entity295 or @entity6 rupee			0
and the effect of sanctions could be enough to push the economy from modest growth ( currently 2.5 % according to the @entity88 ) into recession , economic forecasters say			0
one example is the shortage of steel , which is forcing domestic prices higher in @entity12 and threatening the country 's ambitious plans to build its own steel industry			2
" @entity12 wants to produce 45 million tons of crude steel by 2015 -- by building eight or nine plants			2
but they ca n't finish construction of these plants , which themselves demand a lot of steel to build , " said @entity39 , the @entity2 steel industry specialist			0
@entity318 , @entity319 and @entity320 contributed to this report .			0
