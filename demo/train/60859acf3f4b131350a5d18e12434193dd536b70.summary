-- the @entity1 may be briefly ice - free by september as global warming melts away @entity5 sea ice , according to scientists from the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9			1
" we kind of have an informal betting pool going around in our center and that betting pool is ' does the @entity1 melt out this summer ? ' and it may well , " said the center 's senior research scientist , @entity10			2
it 's a 50 - 50 bet that the thin @entity5 sea ice , which was frozen in autumn , will completely melt away at the geographic @entity1 , @entity10 said			1
the ice retreated to a record level in september when the @entity20 , the sea route through the @entity5 , opened briefly for the first time in recorded history			1
" what we 've seen through the past few decades is the @entity5 sea ice cover is becoming thinner and thinner as the system warms up , " @entity10 said			1
specific weather patterns will determine whether the @entity1 's ice cover melts completely this summer , he said			1
" last year , we had sort of a perfect weather pattern to get rid of ice to open up that @entity20 , " @entity10 said			1
" this year , a different pattern can set up			0
so maybe we 'll preserve some ice there			2
we 're in a wait - and - see mode right now			0
we 'll see what happens			0
" the brief lack of ice at the top of the globe will not bring any immediate consequences , he said			2
" from the viewpoint of the science , the @entity1 is just another point in the globe , but it does have this symbolic meaning , " @entity10 said			0
" there 's supposed to be ice at the @entity1			2
the fact that we may not have any by the end of this summer could be quite a symbolic change			2
" @entity10 said it 's " just another indicator of the disappearing @entity5 sea ice cover " but that it is happening so soon is " just astounding to me			1
" " five years ago , to think that we 'd even be talking about the possibility of the @entity1 melting out in the summer , i would have never thought it , " he said			2
the melting , however , has been long seen as inevitable , he said			0
" if you talked to me or other scientists just a few years ago , we were saying that we might lose all or most of the summer sea ice cover by anywhere from 2050 to 2100 , " @entity10 said			1
" then , recently , we kind of revised those estimates , maybe as early as 2030			0
now , there 's people out there saying it might be even before that			0
so , things are happening pretty quick up there			0
" @entity10 said those who suggest that the @entity5 meltdown is just part of a historic cycle are wrong			1
" it 's not cyclical at this point			0
i think we understand the physics behind this pretty well , " he said			0
" we 've known for at least 30 years , from our earliest climate models , that it 's the @entity5 where we 'd see the first signs of global warming			1
" it 's a situation where we hate to say we told you so , but we told you so , " he said			0
@entity10 said the @entity5 sea ice will not be the same for decades			1
" if we had a few cold years in a row , we could put sort of a temporary damper on it , but i think at this point going to an ice - free @entity5 is inevitable , " he said			1
" i do n't think we can stop that now			0
" reduced greenhouse gas emissions could " cool things down a bit , " he said			0
" it would recover fairly quickly , but it 's just not going to happen for a while , " he said			0
" i think we 're committed at this point			0
" there are some positive aspects to the ice melting , he said			0
ships could use the @entity20 to save time and energy by no longer having to travel through the @entity105 or around @entity106			1
" there 's also , or course , oil at the bottom of the @entity5 , " he said			1
" now , the irony of that is kind of clear , but the fact that we are opening up the @entity5 does make it more accessible			2
" the @entity115 @entity7 web site , @entity116 , publishes a near - real - time image of the @entity5 sea ice cover .			1

ice retreated to a record level last fall when the @entity20 opened briefly
weather patterns will determine whether the ice cover melts completely this summer
scientists say the @entity5 meltdown is not part of a historic cycle
