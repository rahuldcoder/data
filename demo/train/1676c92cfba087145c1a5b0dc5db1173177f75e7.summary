-- gay and lesbian groups are attacking a decision by the archdiocese of @entity5 , @entity6 , not to re-enroll a child in a catholic school in @entity9 , @entity6 , next year because the child 's parents are lesbians			1
the issue centers on the @entity13 , where the pre-schooler is currently enrolled			0
" the @entity17 of @entity5 has acted very unjustly in singling out this child for exclusion , " said dignityusa executive director @entity15 in a written statement monday			1
" until every student 's parents are tested on @entity22 teaching , this action by @entity22 officials can not be understood as anything other than discrimination on the back of a child			1
at a tender age , this child has learned that @entity22 officials are willing to inflict pain on children and families			1
" the decision was made public last week			2
" these actions by the @entity17 harm the student by taking the child away from friends , teachers and community , " said @entity35 , president of the @entity36			1
" it 's deeply troubling to see any school remove a child from their educational program simply as the means of rejecting that child 's parents			1
" but the archdiocese defended its decision			2
" parents living in open discord with @entity22 teaching in areas of faith and morals unfortunately choose by their actions to disqualify their children from enrollment , " it said in a statement posted on its web site			0
" to allow children in these circumstances to continue in our school would be a cause of confusion for the student in that what they are being taught in school conflicts with what they experience in the home			2
" we communicated the policy to the couple at @entity76 as soon as we realized the situation			0
we discussed the reasons with them and have sought to respond in a way that does not abruptly displace the student but at the same time respects the integrity of the catholic school 's philosophy			1
" in a posting of his sermon , the rev. @entity85 , pastor of @entity86 , supported the move			2
" the issue is not about our not accepting ' sinners , ' " he said			0
" it is not about punishing the child for the sins of his or her parents			0
it is simply that the lesbian couple is saying that their relationship is a good one that should be accepted by everyone ; and the @entity103 can not agree to that			0
" about 30 opponents of the move -- " mostly hetero allies of the gay community " -- protested sunday outside the church during @entity110 , said @entity111 , board president of @entity113 , a lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community center and services organization			1
@entity111 handed out flyers to the protesters and then joined the parishioners as they listened to the sermon defending the church 's move			1
" i was disappointed , but it was pretty much what i was expecting to hear , " he said			0
he added that the larger community 's reaction has been positive , saying , " when people hear about this , they speak up , and i think that says a lot about our community			0
" the child has not been identified publicly			0
no one at the archdiocese or at the school immediately returned calls monday seeking comment .			0
