a leading @entity1 cleric warned women who drive cars could cause damage to their ovaries and pelvises and that they are at risk of having children born with " clinical problems			1
" @entity11 's widely derided remarks have gone viral as activists claim a website urging women to defy their country 's driving ban has been blocked in @entity1			1
" if a woman drives a car , " @entity11 told @entity1 news website sabq.org in an interview , " it could have a negative physiological impact ... medical studies show that it would automatically affect a woman 's ovaries and that it pushes the pelvis upward			1
" explained @entity11 , " we find that for women who continuously drive cars , their children are born with varying degrees of clinical problems			0
" the controversial comments , published friday , were widely interpreted throughout @entity1 as an attempt to discourage women in the country from joining a popular online movement urging them to stage a demonstration by driving cars on october 26			1
" this is his answer to the campaign , " @entity1 women 's rights activist @entity41 told @entity42			1
" but it is an individual opinion			0
the clerical establishment is not behind this			0
" added @entity50 : " he 's making a fool of himself			0
he should n't touch this field at all -- the medical field is not his field at all			0
" @entity56 , who was one of the first @entity1 women to sign the online petition , called the comments " ridiculous : " and added , " i am really disappointed			1
how could somebody ever make such a statement ? " @entity11 's words have been ridiculed mercilessly via social media since they were first reported			1
an @entity66 @entity65 hashtag called " @entity67 " was quickly created to make fun of @entity69 -- underscoring just how widely the call for @entity1 women to defy the driving ban has resonated thus far			1
and while numerous conservative voices have supported @entity11 , many @entity1 believe this was an extremely clumsy way of trying to counter the popularity of the october 26 campaign			1
" i do n't think it will harm the campaign -- on the contrary , it will make it stronger , " said @entity1 columnist and author @entity78			2
since it published online over a week ago , a petition on the website @entity88 has garnered more than 12,000 signatures from those asking authorities in the @entity1 to lift a de facto ban than prohibits women from driving			1
" there is no justification for the @entity1 government to prohibit adult women citizens who are capable of driving cars from doing so , " reads part of the petition			1
no traffic law specifically prohibits women from driving in @entity1 , but religious edicts there are often interpreted to mean women are not allowed to operate a vehicle			1
the new petition also urges the @entity1 government to present " to the citizens a valid and legal justification " for the ban , demanding authorities should not simply blame it on " societal consensus			2
" many supporters of the campaign expressed dismay when reporting the website could no longer be accessed throughout the @entity1 as of saturday			2
a post on the @entity119 website read , " society wanting the ban to be lifted is apparently such a threat that the page petitioning the government to lift the ban has been blocked from within @entity1			2
" @entity123 wondered if the numerous conservatives opposed to women being granted the right to drive may have asked for the site to be blocked			0
still , @entity78 said he is n't too concerned			0
" the message has been delivered , " said @entity78			0
" this is a battle we must fight			0
" @entity42 was unable to reach various @entity1 ministries for comment			0
the issue of women driving in the conservative kingdom has long been a contentious one			2
and while such demonstrations are extremely rare , they have been staged at least twice before			0
in june 2011 , dozens of women across @entity1 participated in the " @entity143 " campaign by driving throughout the streets of their cities			1
in 1991 , a group of 47 women drove through the country 's capital city , @entity151			0
after being arrested , many were further punished by being banned from travel and suspended from their workplaces			0
in addition to prohibiting driving , the country 's strict and compulsory guardianship system also prevents women from opening bank accounts , working , traveling and going to school without the express permission of their male guardian			2
@entity1 has been moving toward change under its current ruler , @entity166 , who is considered a cautious reformer and proponent of women 's rights			1
in january , he appointed 30 women to the @entity171 , the first time women had been chosen for the country 's top consultative body			0
in 2011 , he announced that women can run for office and vote in local elections in 2015 , and in 2009 , he appointed @entity1 's first female deputy minister .			2
