-- there is a hidden revolution at work that can transform the lives of a billion of the poorest people on the planet			1
the dream of health for all , even the poorest of the poor , can become a reality because of recent breakthroughs in technology and health systems			1
scientific results that our millennium villages project team published this week in @entity16 , coupled with broader trends around the world , should be a wake - up call : we can end the deaths of millions of young children and mothers each year by building on recent innovations			1
in 2006 , the @entity24 and impoverished communities around @entity26 jointly embarked upon the fight against extreme poverty , hunger and disease			2
the idea was to use low - cost , cutting - edge technologies to overcome ancient scourges like malaria and mothers dying in childbirth			2
today , there is no deep mystery about what to do to stop these deaths , since the diagnostic tests , medicines and procedures are known			1
the challenge is to scale up these life - saving approaches			0
in four years , starting from conditions of massive death tolls and a lack of health services , the @entity24 were able to reduce the deaths of children under 5 - years - old by around 22 %			1
the progress is continuing as low - cost health services expand			1
the lessons extend far beyond this specific project			0
poor children die of three main categories of disease : infections , nutritional deficiencies and conditions around childbirth			1
the technologies and procedures to fight all these causes of death are improving dramatically			0
therein lies a great hope			0
consider malaria , one of the biggest killers of children in @entity26			1
a dozen years ago , all seemed lost : the standard medicine had lost its efficacy as the parasite became resistant ; insecticide - treated bed nets were little used because they had to be regularly retreated with the insecticide , a practical burden that poor villages could not manage ; and diagnosis required that the mother and sick child trek to a distant clinic in the desperate hope the clinic had a functioning laboratory			1
now all this has changed			0
a new generation of low - cost and highly effective medicines has been deployed			1
the nets now last five years without the need for retreatment			0
a trained village - based worker , as part of an expanded health system , can make the diagnosis at the household using a simple rapid test , without the need for a life - and - death journey to a distant clinic			1
the @entity24 have slashed malaria deaths , but much more to the point , malaria deaths are falling sharply across @entity26 , down by around one - third from their peak roughly a decade ago			0
new vaccines can fight diarrheal and respiratory diseases that have traditionally killed vast numbers of children			1
thanks to vaccines , deaths from measles have plummeted , and polio is on the verge of eradication			0
new medical procedures can end the transmission of the @entity124 virus from mother to newborn			0
technologies to support higher farm production and low - cost nutritional supplements can bolster inadequate diets			0
perhaps most important , information can flow through even the remotest of villages , thanks to the massive increase in mobile telephones across regions that just a few years ago had no phones at all			1
the spread of mobile phones may mark the fastest global uptake of a technology in history			1
from a few million mobile phone subscribers worldwide in 1990 , the number has climbed to more than 6 billion today , with more than 250 million subscribers in @entity26			0
mobile connectivity and the spread of wireless broadband are greatly strengthening rural health systems			2
in all of the @entity151 , and in more and more villages around the continent , lay community workers are bringing health services from the clinics right to the community			2
mobile phones are critical in supporting these outreach workers , enabling them to call the doctors and nurses for advice , summon an ambulance or connect to a computerized expert system via text messaging			2
the big picture is thrilling			0
globally , deaths of young children are falling			2
in 1990 , the worldwide deaths of children under 5 totaled around 12.5 million			2
by 2010 , the deaths were down to around 7.6 million			0
yet this technology - based revolution in human well - being is at the risk of stalling			2
the improvements required international help to support the expansion of services in the poorest regions			0
the @entity182 to @entity183 , tuberculosis , and @entity185 and the @entity188 @entity187 initiative to fight @entity183 exemplify the new kinds of support introduced during the past decade			0
total funding for primary health care in the poorest countries has risen by roughly $ 15 billion per year from the low levels of aid a dozen years back			1
that 's a good sum , but modest in the scheme of things , amounting to around $ 15 per person per year from the high - income countries , with a combined population of 1 billion			1
it 's about half the support needed to complete the job			0
alarmingly , the funding has come to a standstill and has even started to decline			2
the @entity188 and @entity206 claim they ca n't afford to do more because of budget crises , but the needed sums could be filled many times over just by ending the loopholes that allow the richest companies to park their profits in @entity215 tax havens			0
if children continue to die by the millions , it will be the result of misguided priorities , not true budget limits			1
instead of making excuses for lives lost , let us celebrate the remarkable progress we are making and commit ourselves to finishing this historic and worthy task			0

@entity227 : health innovations can save millions of poor children each year
sachs : cell phones , fast diagnostic tests , better medicines changing global health
but this revolution in poor countries is *threatened* by funding cuts , he says
sachs : *wealthy* nations must not *abandon* the programs just as they are *paying* off
