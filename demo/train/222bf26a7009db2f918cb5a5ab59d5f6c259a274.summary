-- just about six years after his career seemed to come to a crashing halt , when @entity4 defeated him in the presidential election of 2008 , @entity8 sen. @entity7 is poised to re-emerge as a major player in the next two years			1
as the new chairman of the influential @entity11 , @entity7 will be able to use this perch of power to loudly challenge the president 's foreign policy agenda			1
call it @entity7 's revenge			1
for several years , it seemed as if @entity7 was finished			2
the 2008 election delivered a huge blow to his political standing			0
once considered the exciting maverick of @entity23 who could attract supporters from both parties , as a result of his pursuit of campaign finance reform and willingness to enter into bipartisan alliances , @entity7 won the award from many observers for running one of the worst campaigns ever			2
his attempt to cater to the right wing of the @entity38 and his selection of @entity41 gov. @entity40 as his running mate led many to question his political future			0
during much of @entity4 's presidency he seemed to struggle			1
he has often been at odds with members of his own party , including tea party @entity38 who have pushed for a sharply rightward shift in domestic policy ( and challenged him in the primary in 2010 when @entity52 ran again him ) , as well as anti-interventionists , such as @entity55 sen. @entity54 who have given strength to @entity38 rhetoric about limiting the scale and scope of the nation 's national security operations			2
@entity7 has regained some of his footing by becoming the voice of the neoconservative @entity38 , a group that many wrote off as a lost voice after the fiasco in @entity69			2
these members of @entity38 still believe the @entity71 needs to maintain a muscular foreign policy and can not afford to constrain national security operations			1
@entity7 has blasted @entity4 for not doing enough to combat the threat of @entity75			1
he has been a consistent critic of the decision to withdraw troops from @entity69			0
of @entity75 , he said in september , " it was like watching a train wreck and warning every step of the way that this was happening			0
" now that @entity38 have retaken control of the @entity84 , @entity7 will be the chairman of the @entity11			1
this is an important post where he will have a chance to play a big role in debates over foreign policy			1
@entity7 made his intentions clear			2
he recently explained that , " i want the committee to be very active			0
that 's the beauty of the majority , as you know			0
of course we can allocate and authorize certain programs , and we can cut others			0
the president proposes , and @entity99 disposes			0
" the resignation of secretary of defense @entity101 has already offered him a chance to start saying what is on his mind			0
@entity7 has praised his former @entity84 colleague for his work at the @entity109 and said that @entity110 was a victim of @entity4 's failed foreign policies			1
@entity110 , @entity7 argued , was " very , very frustrated with the administration			2
" when the nomination hearings begin to replace him , @entity7 will have an even greater opportunity to stand on his soap box and outline to the public everything that has gone wrong in the past six years			2
there will be other opportunities as well			0
as new crises flair in @entity121 and @entity69 , the @entity119 must make decisions about troop levels			0
@entity7 will have a chance to reiterate his claims about how a passive @entity119 has endangered the national security interest and created too much space for radical elements overseas to gain a stronger foothold in the @entity130			2
in the debates over the budget , @entity7 will try to reverse the military spending cuts that the president has put into place			0
next summer , when @entity99 has to reauthorize a key part of the @entity138 dealing with surveillance , the senator will be able to push back against members of his own party as well as @entity142 who think that the answer to the problems is to weaken the ability of the government to spy on potential threats with phone and email surveillance			0
@entity7 , who is expecting a tea party challenge for his re-election bid in 2016 , is going to have a huge incentive to be aggressive in promoting himself as a major player in the @entity38 and crafting a conservative agenda that he can feel comfortable with ( unlike when he did this in 2008 on domestic issues and looked as fake as a bad @entity159 actor )			1
@entity7 's new platform will create a challenge , not only for the president , but for @entity163 , assuming she runs for the presidency in 2016			1
given @entity166 's service as secretary of state , she wo n't be able to escape her connections to the president 's record			0
@entity166 will surely try to make distinctions , as she did in her book " @entity173 " when she reminded @entity71 she wanted a more aggressive stand in @entity121 , but ultimately she will be judged on @entity4 's record because she was a key player in this administration			1
the more aggressive that @entity7 is during the coming years , the more @entity166 will have to respond to his agenda			1
reports of @entity7 's political death were greatly exaggerated , to paraphrase @entity180			1
and @entity142 had better watch out .			0

@entity182 : sen. @entity7 is poised to re-emerge as a major player in the next two years
@entity182 : as the new chairman of the influential @entity11 , he will have much to say
he says @entity7 will be able to use new power to challenge @entity4 's foreign policy agenda
@entity182 : reports of @entity7 's political death were greatly exaggerated , despite his setbacks
