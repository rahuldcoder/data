@entity0 -- a medical plane whisked an @entity3 infected with @entity4 from @entity5 to @entity6 on saturday , the latest leg of a race to save the first known patient with the deadly virus to be treated on @entity3 soil			1
shortly after the plane landed , an ambulance rushed dr. @entity14 from @entity15 to @entity0 's @entity16			1
he 's one of two @entity3 sickened by the deadly viral hemorrhagic fever last month while on the front lines of a major outbreak in @entity20			2
video from @entity16 showed someone in a white , full - body protective suit helping a similarly clad person emerge from the ambulance and walk into the hospital			2
hospital visitor : ' oh , my @entity28 ' @entity16 has said it will treat @entity14 , 33 , and fellow missionary @entity30 in an isolation unit			1
the plane equipped with an isolation unit can only transport one patient at a time			2
it will now pick up @entity30 in @entity5 and bring her to @entity6 early next week , said @entity36 , spokesman for @entity38 charity @entity37 , with which both @entity3 were affiliated			1
@entity14 's wife , parents and sister cried when they saw him on @entity1 walking from the ambulance into the hospital , another representative of @entity37 said on condition of anonymity			1
his wife , @entity48 , later said she was relieved that her husband was back in the @entity3			1
" i spoke with him , and he is glad to be back in the @entity3 , " she said in statement			1
" i am thankful to @entity28 for his safe transport and for giving him the strength to walk into the hospital			0
" @entity14 's wife visited with him from behind a glass wall for about 45 minutes , the @entity37 representative said			1
@entity14 was described as " in great spirits and so grateful			2
" @entity59 doctor who worked with @entity4 patients quarantines self @entity14 , who has ties to @entity63 and @entity64 , and @entity30 , of @entity65 , became sick while caring for @entity4 patients in @entity5 , one of three @entity20 nations hit by an outbreak			1
treatment in isolation this will be the first human @entity4 test for a @entity3 medical facility			1
the patients will be treated at an isolated unit where precautions are in place to keep such deadly diseases from spreading , unit supervisor dr. @entity75 said			0
everything that comes in and out of the unit will be controlled , @entity75 said , and it will have windows and an intercom for staff to interact with patients without being in the room			0
@entity4 is not airborne or waterborne , and spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood , saliva , urine and other secretions of infected people			1
there is no @entity99 - approved treatment for @entity4 , and @entity16 will use what @entity75 calls " supportive care			1
" that means carefully tracking a patient 's symptoms , vital signs and organ function and taking measures , such as blood transfusions and dialysis , to keep patients stable			0
dr. @entity111 : @entity4 will go global " we just have to keep the patient alive long enough in order for the body to control this infection , " @entity75 said			1
@entity30 was given an experimental serum this week , @entity37 said , though its purpose and effects were n't immediately publicized			0
the ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever , which refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding			0
early symptoms include sudden onset of fever , weakness , muscle pain , headaches and a sore throat			0
they later progress to vomiting , diarrhea , impaired kidney and liver function -- and sometimes internal and external bleeding			0
@entity138 , president of @entity139 , a christian mission organization with which @entity30 also is linked , said saturday that both were seriously ill but stable			0
" my last report ( on @entity14 ) was yesterday			2
... he was ambulatory , being able to talk , converse , and get up			0
so that was encouraging , " @entity138 said saturday morning			0
on @entity30 , @entity138 said : " she 's responsive , and we 're encouraged at how she 's doing			0
" @entity16 's isolation unit was created with the @entity147 , based down the road			2
it aims to optimize care for those with highly infectious diseases and is one of four @entity3 institutions capable of providing such treatment			2
the @entity156 reports that the outbreak in @entity5 , @entity158 and @entity159 is believed to have infected 1,323 people and killed more than 729 this year , as of july 27			1
fear , conspiracy theories as officials worked to bring the two @entity3 home , the idea of intentionally bringing @entity4 into the @entity3 has rattled many nerves			1
" the road to hell was paved with good intentions , " wrote one person , using the hashtag # @entity168			0
" what do we say to our kids when they get sick & die ? " on the website of conspiracy talker @entity178 , who has long purported the @entity147 could unleash a pandemic and the government would react by instituting authoritarian rule , the news was a feast of fodder			0
" feds would exercise draconian emergency powers if @entity4 hits @entity3 , " a headline read on infowars.com			1
@entity75 repeatedly downplayed the risk for anyone who will be in contact with @entity14 or @entity30			2
" we have two individuals who are critically ill , and we feel that we owe them the right to receive the best medical care , " @entity75 said			0
the fight against @entity4 all concerns about the @entity3 pale in comparison to the harsh reality in the hardest - hit areas			1
even in the best - case scenario , it could take three to six months to stem the epidemic in @entity20 , said dr. @entity202 , director of the @entity147			0
there 's no vaccine , though one is in the works			0
there 's no standardized treatment for the disease , either ; the most common approach is to support organ functions and keep up bodily fluids such as blood and water long enough for the body to fight off the infection			0
the @entity217 plans to begin testing an experimental @entity4 vaccine in people as early as september			2
tests on primates have been successful			0
so far , the outbreak is confined to @entity20			0
although infections are dropping in @entity159 , they are on the rise in @entity5 and @entity158			2
in the 1990s , an @entity4 strain tied to monkeys -- @entity228 -- was found in the @entity3 , but no humans got sick from it , according to the @entity147			1
experts : @entity3 health care system well - prepared for @entity4 @entity1 's @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 contributed to this report .			1
