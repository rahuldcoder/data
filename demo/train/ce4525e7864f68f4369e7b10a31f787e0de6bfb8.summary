-- i vaguely recall @entity3 's book it elementary school reading incentive program			1
though , to be fair , i vaguely remember what i had for breakfast			2
i think it was a ginger ale			2
book it was a long time ago for me , but i 'm pretty sure all i had to do was track my progress every month in school , hit a certain goal , and then i 'd win a free erotic massage			1
either that or a one - topping personal pan pizza			1
my memory 's a little fuzzy			2
but it was probably the pizza			1
inspired by president @entity18 urging corporations to get involved in education ( hooray , tax write offs ! ) , @entity3 officially started its book it program in 1984			1
right about the time i was at @entity25 with a fresh sponge of a brain , perfect for infusing with warm , lifelong memories of big corporations			0
oh , if only some cigarette company had started the " @entity30 " program			1
i could see a large poster near the chalkboard with , say , the @entity35 using a buck knife to scratch out simple subtractions on an old fencepost			0
above him , against a golden setting sun , would be the slogan : " let math light up your brain with fun ! " hell yeah ! and if your class had the best test scores in the country ? that 's right			0
you got a personal school visit from the old dying cowboy himself			0
" @entity53 , why is this man coughing up blood ? " fortunately that program did n't happen			1
cigarette companies never got to us			0
but 30 years later , book it is still going strong			1
and recently , for just a short time , @entity3 celebrated this milestone anniversary with an online - only book it alumni program for those of us who participated when we were young			1
i guess it was finally time to start tapping into those aging sponge brains with a little nostalgia			0
how dare they double - dip their delicious , mozzarella - covered corporate hands into my childhood ? how dare they lure us into their restaurants with cozy memories from a bygone era ? how dare they ? forget it			0
or at least i would 've been			0
otherwise , had i signed up as a book it alumni , i would 've received a free one - topping personal pan pizza			1
just like the old days			0
how could i have missed this ? without free pizza my life is meaningless			1
sadly , not much has changed for me since i was in elementary school			0
i 'm a little taller now and doctors have long since assigned fancy acronyms to explain why i could n't sit still in my seat			1
but , otherwise , i remain an awkward , hairy man - child , easily persuaded to do things in the name of food			0
" @entity98 , i need you to start a huge arson fire			0
" " but that 's destructive and wrong			0
" " i 'll give you a free one - topping personal pan pizza			1
" " everything must burn			0
" now , if your school was n't a part of the book it program from back in the day , you sort of have to realize that this was actually a pretty big deal			1
because , again , the reward was n't just any pizza			1
you see , there 's no sharing a personal pan pizza			1
we have rules in this country , and rule number one is @entity123 ! you hear me ? oh , you think this is cute ? you think this is a joke ? you think i 'm breathing heavy and ripped my shirt off over nothing ? listen , pal			0
you wan na know what happens to people who try to grab just a little taste of another man 's personal pan pizza ? you wan na know what happens ? @entity138 ! ( author shakes his head ) whoa			1
anyway , the point is that it was your pizza			2
and , even better , it was from @entity3 ! when i was young , @entity3 was almost fancy			1
back then it was more like a proper sit - down restaurant , and it had that iconic red roof that was totally unmistakable from any other pizza joint			2
it was actually cool to eat at @entity3			1
even cooler if you were n't wearing pants			2
these days , however , @entity157 tend to be just these little delivery outlets -- small depots for the drivers to come and pick up the pies before heading out to your house			0
and i have n't had it in decades			2
there 's just so much good pizza out there			2
in fact , in my neighborhood in @entity171 , we have a little punk rock pizza place called @entity174 's			2
and i prefer theirs to all others because i wholeheartedly trust any restaurant where the tattoo - to - staff ratio is 60 - to - 1			0
good tattoos make good pizza			2
but for old time 's sake -- as an alumni -- had i not missed the deadline , i happily would have cheated on my favorite local spot just once for that personal pan pizza			1
so , happy anniversary , book it			2
look what you almost made me do			0
follow @ @entity194 on @entity195			0
and prepare to be underwhelmed			0
