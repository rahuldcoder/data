-- the @entity2 government said monday it was " shocked " as it sifted through tens of thousands of leaked @entity5 military and diplomatic reports on the war in @entity2 that a whistleblower website posted a day earlier			1
" the @entity2 government is shocked with the report that has opened the reality of the @entity2 war , " said @entity8 , a government spokesman			1
@entity12 -- a whistleblower website -- published on sunday what it says are more than 90,000 @entity5 military and diplomatic reports about @entity2 filed between 2004 and january of this year			1
are you reading the documents ? tell us what you find the first - hand accounts are the military 's own raw data on the war , including numbers killed , casualties , threat reports and the like , according to @entity27 , the founder of the website			1
" it is the total history of the @entity2 war from 2004 to 2010 , with some important exceptions -- @entity33 , @entity35 activity , and most of the activity of other non- @entity5 groups , " @entity27 said			1
@entity0 has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the documents			1
the @entity41 will not comment on them until the @entity41 has had a chance to look at them , a defense official told @entity0			2
" what you have here is you have a variety of reports of different types , " said @entity46 reporter @entity45			1
" many of them are simple incident reports			1
the military describing ... on the ground what happened			2
" the @entity46 reported sunday that military field documents included in the release suggest that @entity63 , an ally of the @entity5 in the war against terror , has been running something of a " double game , " allowing " representatives of its spy service to meet directly with the @entity72 in secret strategy sessions to organize networks of militant groups that fight against @entity5 soldiers in @entity2 , and even hatch plots to assassinate @entity2 leaders			1
" @entity8 charged that @entity79 needed to deal with @entity63 intelligence , known as the @entity81			1
" there should be serious action taken against the @entity81 , who has a direct connection with the terrorists , " he said			2
" these reports show that the @entity5 was already aware of the @entity81 connection with the @entity90 terrorist network			1
the @entity5 is overdue on the @entity81 issue and now the @entity5 should answer			2
" but gen. @entity92 , the former head of @entity63 's intelligence service and who is mentioned numerous times in the @entity12 reports , called the accusations lies			1
" these reports are absolutely and utterly false , " @entity92 said monday			1
" i think they [ @entity5 ] are failing and they 're looking for scapegoats			0
" @entity102 , @entity63 's ambassador to the @entity5 , issued a statement sunday saying the reports " do not reflect the current onground realities			1
" rather , they " reflect nothing more than single source comments and rumors , which abound on both sides of the @entity63 - @entity2 border and are often proved wrong after deeper examination , " @entity102 's statement said			1
" @entity63 's government under the democratically elected leadership of president [ @entity117 and prime minister [ @entity118 ] @entity119 is following a clearly laid out strategy of fighting and marginalizing terrorists and our military and intelligence services are effectively executing that policy , " the statement said			1
national security adviser gen. @entity127 issued a statement sunday calling the documents ' release " irresponsible			1
" " the @entity5 strongly condemns the disclosure of classified information by individuals and organizations which could put the lives of @entity5 and our partners at risk , and threaten our national security , " the statement said			0
" these irresponsible leaks will not impact our ongoing commitment to deepen our partnerships with @entity2 and @entity63 ; to defeat our common enemies ; and to support the aspirations of the @entity2 and @entity63 people , " the statement said			1
@entity27 declined to tell @entity0 where he got the documents			1
@entity127 ' statement said the website made " no effort " to contact the @entity154 administration about the documents			2
" the @entity5 government learned from news organizations that these documents would be posted , " @entity127 ' statement said			1
@entity27 claims the documents reveal the " squalor " of war , uncovering how many relatively small incidents have added up to huge numbers of dead civilians			2
the significance lies in " all of these people being killed in the small events that we have n't heard about that numerically eclipse the big casualty events			2
it 's the boy killed by a shell that missed a target , " he told @entity0			2
" what we have n't seen previously is all those individual deaths , " he said			0
" we 've seen just the number and , like @entity181 said , ' one man 's death is a tragedy , a million dead is a statistic			2
' so , we 've seen the statistic			0
" @entity12 publishes anonymously submitted documents , video and other sensitive materials after vetting them , it says			2
it claims never to have fallen for a forgery			0
@entity193 chairman @entity192 , @entity194 , said in a statement sunday that the documents -- regardless of how they came to light -- " raise serious questions about the reality of @entity5 's policy toward @entity63 and @entity2			1
" @entity12 has previously made headlines for posting controversial videos of combat in @entity204			0
the site gained international attention in april when it posted a 2007 video said to show a @entity5 helicopter attack in @entity204 killing a dozen civilians , including two unarmed @entity211 journalists			0
at the time , maj. @entity212 , a @entity5 military spokesman , said that " all evidence available supported the conclusion by those forces that they were engaging armed insurgents and not civilians			0
@entity219 , 22 , suspected of leaking a classified 2007 video , has been charged by the @entity5 military with eight violations of the @entity5 @entity223 for transferring classified data , according to a charge sheet released by the military earlier this month			0
attempts to reach @entity219 's military defense attorney , capt. @entity228 , were unsuccessful sunday			2
however , @entity230 spokesman col. @entity229 has said @entity231 would not speak to the media about the charges			0
@entity27 says @entity12 has attempted to put together a legal team to defend @entity219 , something it will do for any " alleged " whistleblower that runs into legal trouble because of @entity12			0
@entity27 -- a former teen hacker who launched the site in 2007 -- denies that @entity12 has put troops in danger			0
" there certainly have been people who have lost elections as a result of material being on @entity12 , " he said			0
" there have been prosecutions because of material being on @entity12			0
there have been legislative reforms because of material being on @entity12 , " he said			0
" what has not happened is anyone being physically harmed as a result			0
" the website held back about 15,000 documents from @entity2 to protect individuals who informed on the @entity72 , he said			1
but he said he hoped his website would be " very dangerous " to " people who want to conduct wars in an abusive way			0
" " this material does n't just reveal occasional abuse by the @entity5 military , " he said			0
" of course it has @entity5 military reporting on all sort of abuses by the @entity72			0
... so it does describe the abuses by both sides in this war and that 's how people can understand what 's really going on and if they choose to support it or not			2
" @entity27 said the organization gets material from whistle - blowers in a variety of ways -- including via postal mail -- vets it , releases it to the public and then defends itself against " the regular political or legal attack			0
" he said the organization rarely knows the identity of the source of the leak			0
" if we find out at some stage , we destroy that information as soon as possible , " he said			0
@entity0 @entity41 correspondent @entity294 contributed to this report .			0
