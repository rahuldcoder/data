-- social media management company @entity1 released a free tool thursday , the @entity3 , designed to help marketers get a better understanding of a @entity8 page 's value			1
just submit a @entity9 and the app will come up with a valuation based on factors like number of fans , number of posts per day , number of interactions and so forth.ssss it 's a cool -- if not completely scientific -- way to gauge the potential value of your @entity8 page to advertisers			1
the formula used by the @entity3 is related to the formula that @entity1 released last month to estimate the relative value of @entity27 to big brands			0
the tool , which was built over 63 hours in a @entity31 - style project , is adjustable and interactive			1
for instance , the base rate of @entity33 ( or @entity34 in more traditional terms ) is $ 5 , but this can be adjusted to a higher or lower value depending on the brand in question			0
likewise , there is a " fan - tasize " section that lets you manipulate other features like number of posts per day , engagement level and fan count to see how that affects the valuation			1
you can also compare a @entity52 with up to three other brands at a time and view a @entity56 's value history			0
in addition to the valuation data , there is also a list of best practices for getting the most out of your @entity52			0
so how accurate is this tool ? it 's difficult to determine , as it is based on a formula that , while derived from a study of large brands , is obviously not going to be applicable to all companies			2
still , it 's a fun , easy way to get an idea of the factors that impact a @entity52 valuation			2
it 's also a good stepping stone for marketers to start thinking about the potential advertising power of a @entity52			2
what do you think of the tool ? let us know ! Â© 2010 @entity0			0
