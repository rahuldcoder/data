@entity0 -- @entity3 's judicial system faced an uproar this week after one of the country 's highest courts upheld a decision to reduce sentences against 26 men convicted of having sex with a 13 - year old girl			1
public outrage stemmed from a court ruling that the 13 - year old girl had willingly engaged in " consensual " sexual relations with the 26 men			1
among the growing chorus of critics was @entity3 's president @entity19			1
" i take particular care not to make any direct statements on issues that are in the judicial process , " @entity19 wrote in a series of statements on his @entity23 account on friday			0
" [ but ] the decision about reducing the punishment related with what happened to a young child of ours made me deeply uncomfortable ... there is still the possibility for an appeal			1
i am hoping for an outcome that will comfort the public conscience			0
" the case in question dates back to 2002 , when 26 men from the southeastern @entity3 town of @entity47 were accused of repeatedly having sex with a 13 - year old girl identified only by the initials " @entity51 " according to @entity3 media reports , the men , who included village ' muhtars ' [ mayors ] and a gendarme officer , were accused of paying money to two adult female intermediaries during a 7 - month period for repeated access to the girl			1
@entity3 's @entity57 has now found itself under fire from women 's rights groups , lawyers ' associations , and senior government officials			1
in response , the head of the @entity57 's 14th @entity64 adopted a somewhat contradictory position			2
" the evaluations of the court were correct			0
this decision is not definite , it is also not possible for this decision to be changed by making noise , " said @entity71 of the @entity57 , in an interview with the semi-official @entity73 on friday			0
the courts sentenced the 26 accused rapists ' according to an earlier version of the country 's penal code , which underwent significant revisions in 2005			2
the older penal code entailed lesser punishments for defendants found guilty of sexually assaulting children			0
" in the old penal code there was a very clear article which said it did n't matter if you were under 15 [ years of age ] or over 15 ... if any rape or sexual assault happened with the consent of the girl or the woman , then the sentence would be reduced , " said @entity88 of the group @entity89 , who lobbied for the 2005 revision of the @entity3 criminal code			1
" in the new @entity3 penal code there is no question of consent , that is incredibly important for us , " @entity88 added			2
" in terms of girls and boys under 15 it says very clearly any violation of the body for sexual purposes is defined as sexual abuse in the new code			0
which means that sexual assault or the violation of the body should have a higher sentence			0
" according to @entity3 media reports , some of the 26 defendants were acquitted , while others received jail sentences of one to four years			1
" this decision is an outright scandal , " said @entity88 , the women 's rights advocate			2
in his statement to @entity73 , @entity71 , the official from the @entity57 , argued that the court had no choice but to sentence the defendants according to the pre- 2005 version of the penal code			0
" we do n't have any other option , " @entity71 said			0
" this is an undebatable rule of law			0
" but that decision was challenged by the @entity144 on friday , which called the ruling " legally inappropriate			2
" meanwhile , in a written statement released on her ministry 's web - site , @entity151 and @entity153 policies minister @entity152 argued the ruling violated not only the current criminal code , but also the older version which had been in force in 2002 at the time when the 26 men were accused of having sex with the 13 year old			1
" i find the decision of the @entity57 14th @entity64 to approve the verdict of the local court that a 13 - year old child ' got together with the defendants of her own free will ' unacceptable and worrying , " @entity161 wrote			1
" i would like to remind the judiciary that its primary task is to protect the victim and the rights of the one who was sexually abused , " she added .			0
