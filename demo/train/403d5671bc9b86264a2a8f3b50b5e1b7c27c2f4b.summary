@entity0 -- thousands of @entity3 employees can breathe a little easier after learning they wo n't be furloughed due to forced budget cuts , but that assurance is good only until october 1 , when a new fiscal year begins for the federal government			1
attorney general @entity9 sent a memo to department workers on wednesday , which @entity1 obtained			1
it said , " thousands of critical @entity15 and @entity16 agents , deputy @entity18 marshals , prosecutors , and other department employees will remain on the job protecting national security , fighting violent crime and enforcing our laws			0
" employees were expected to be furloughed as many as 14 days when across - the - board budget cuts went into effect earlier this year after the @entity30 and @entity31 could n't agree on another way to reduce the deficit			2
@entity9 said he can avoid furloughing workers for now because of new budget authority granted at the end of march and because he has moved some funds from different programs to be able to pay employees			1
but @entity9 said the more than $ 1.6 billion in cuts affecting various government agencies will still hurt the @entity3 because he has had to cut contract spending and training and wo n't be able to fill open jobs because of a hiring freeze			2
according to @entity9 , " furloughs are a distinct possibility " when the new fiscal year begins			1
rep. @entity47 , the @entity49 @entity48 who chairs the @entity51 subcommittee that oversees @entity3 funding , sent a letter to @entity9 on wednesday saying he could transfer funds to avoid the furloughs			0
but @entity47 said if the department had not purchased @entity61 prison " those resources would have been available to cushion the impact " of forced budget cuts			1
in 2012 , the government bought the prison from the state of @entity64 for $ 165 million			0
many republicans opposed the purchase and worried the administration would move @entity69 detainees to that facility			0
@entity9 made assurances that would not happen			0
@entity9 quickly sent a letter back to @entity47 saying the prison purchase was not made with money needed to run the department .			0

attorney general @entity9 says funds have been moved to keep workers on the job
but forced budget cuts may affect workers when the new fiscal year begins in october
@entity9 says the cuts will still affect the @entity3 in other ways
