-- @entity2 's government is not aware of any threat against international aid workers helping with flood relief efforts in the country , despite concerns from @entity9 officials and others			1
@entity2 information minister @entity11 told @entity0 sunday that he knows of no specific threat against the aid workers and that the government has not received any information of such threats			1
he said if any aid worker requires security , the @entity2 goverment will provide it			0
earlier , @entity21 administrator @entity20 has addressed reports of threats to international aid workers helping with flood relief efforts in @entity2 , calling it " deeply saddening that others would choose to use these environments to propagate themselves or to threaten international aid workers			1
" @entity20 , who leads the @entity9 agency that provides economic and humanitarian assistance worldwide , said friday that he himself had been forced to leave one food distribution site early due to " suspicious individuals " in the area			1
" i had hoped to spend more time talking to people in line , but within a few minutes of being there , our diplomatic security detail informed me that there were some suspicious individuals in the area and we needed to leave , " he said			1
@entity20 's comments came a day after the @entity44 announced it had obtained information about threats against foreign aid workers who are assisting with relief efforts in the flood - ravaged country , where monsoon rains have killed 1,639 people			1
" we are concerned that extremist elements within @entity2 may decide to attack foreigners who are in @entity2 helping the people of @entity2 , or may choose at this time to attack government institutions in @entity2 that are responding on behalf of the @entity2 people , " @entity44 spokesman @entity53 told reporters thursday			2
@entity20 expressed disappointment at the threats , saying , " i ca n't tell you how ... inappropriate that feels when you 've been there and you 've talked to people who have literally lost everything and are just trying to survive			0
" at least 17 million @entity2 have been affected by the monsoon floods that began a month ago , and thousands remain at risk			0
@entity53 said the @entity9 is doing everything it can to ensure that the @entity9 and @entity2 disaster response can continue despite the threat			0
" the fact that suspicious individuals had been in this site -- in part because they knew i was coming , and the day before , our security folks who had gone out there , of course , had n't seen any signs of them -- is an indication these are open sites , " @entity20 said			2
" people can get there			0
the whole point is to have people who are in urgent need come and get food			0
so it 's just -- it 's deeply saddening that others would choose to use these environments to propagate themselves or to threaten international aid workers			2
