" he was aiming right at them as he was two feet away ... he was n't shooting around the cafeteria at all			1
he was directly aiming at the four of them , " he said			2
@entity1 was lucky ; he was n't hit			2
five others were when a young man allegedly opened fire on that table of students in the @entity9 cafeteria , killing one and seriously injuring four			1
police arrested the suspected shooter a short time later			0

another witness , @entity51 , had his ear grazed by one of the gunman 's bullets			1
he was sitting at a table next to the suspected shooter			0
