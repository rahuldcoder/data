@entity0 -- a seven - term @entity3 congressman , who 54 % of the @entity5 people were not aware of last week , just knocked the president of the @entity5 off of his perch as the most talked - about politician on the largest social media platform in the world			1
according to the exclusive @entity15 - @entity14 , @entity13 rep. @entity13 , in the first 54 hours after being announced as @entity12 's vice-presidential running mate , sucked up the political oxygen in the social media landscape -- with the @entity18 topping the buzz and his home state of @entity3 close behind			1
what caught our eye ? the swing states of @entity25 ( where @entity13 was announced ) and @entity26 were also high on the list : @entity15 - @entity1 talk meter scores 1			2
vice president @entity31 4.01 4			0
gov. @entity12 3.74 for perspective , when @entity32 became the most decorated olympian in history on july 31 , he registered a 6.51 on the same 1 - 10 scale			2
top 10 states + @entity0 buzzing about @entity13 1			0
@entity43 note : the talk meter calculates a jump in buzz , so @entity13 's relative anonymity helped him jump up the talk meter scale			1
yet the growth was n't just in buzz , but also in " likes " -- the @entity15 term for social approval which enables people to follow your moves closely and voice their support to their social networks			2
@entity13 's new fan page has grown from zero to more than half a million fans , already topping that of the sitting vice president , @entity31			1
@entity15 fan growth at publication time @entity30 27.8 million fans currently since august 1 : added 150,000 fans ( +0.5 % ) since saturday : added 9,900 fans ( +0.03 % ) @entity31 355,000 fans currently since august 1 : added 4,200 fans ( +1.2 % ) since saturday : added 728 fans ( +0.2 % ) @entity12 4.1 million fans currently since august 1 : added 906,600 fans ( +28.3 % ) since saturday : added 111,400 fans ( +2.8 % ) @entity13 501,000 fans currently since august : fan page did n't exist on saturday : added 222,100 fans since saturday : added 237,900 fans ( +107.1 % ) fans by state @entity30 1			1
@entity3 we often say we write about demographics , not politics			0
thus it comes as no surprise that we are once again writing about the gender gap and the age gap in this election -- something that the insights from @entity15 reveal also exist online			0
gender and age breakdown of @entity15 fans @entity30 average age : 28 male : 51 % female : 49 % @entity31 average age : 35 male : 51 % female : 49 % @entity12 average age : 46 male : 50 % female : 50 % @entity13 vp average age : 43 male : 63 % female : 37 % how this translates to the election will be something we keep our eye on from now until november			1
it 's staggering when you put it in historical perspective : today there are 160 million monthly active users on @entity15 in the @entity5 -- more than half the @entity5 population			0
in 2008 , there were 35 million monthly active users .			0

since being announced as @entity12 's running mate , @entity13 has *dominated* social media
@entity13 's relative anonymity before being *picked* helped him jump up the scale
@entity13 's @entity15 fans skew more toward males and older
