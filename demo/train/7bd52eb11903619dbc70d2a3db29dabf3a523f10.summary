-- @entity2 's shelling of a border town in @entity4 has sparked fears that president @entity7 's attempt to snuff out a rebellion at home could turn into a damaging regional war between the two neighbors			1
five civilians , all women and children , in the town of @entity15 were killed by @entity2 artillery rounds in the worst single case of violence on the @entity4 side of the border since @entity2 's unrest began last year			1
what 's behind @entity2 's shelling of @entity4 ? while @entity2 has n't confirmed its motive for firing into @entity4 , rebels fighting an 18 - month war against the @entity7 regime have allegedly been using positions on the @entity4 border as a safe haven to regroup and re-arm following battles with @entity2 troops			1
another explanation , says one expert , is that in a cat - and - mouse pursuit to neutralize rebel groups near the border , @entity2 artillery units simply overshot their target			0
" these things happen in the fog of war , " @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity42 editor of @entity43 , told @entity0			0
" if your artillery battery is 10 kilometers away and you 're trying to call a strike down on the border , it 's pretty easy to put a few rounds in the wrong place if you put in the calculations wrong			0
" opinion : why @entity4 , @entity2 do n't want war the incident prompted the @entity4 parliament to give the government powers to authorize troops to deploy to foreign countries , along with retaliatory @entity4 artillery strikes on military positions in @entity2 -- but both sides have insisted they do n't want war			1
which country , @entity2 or @entity4 , has the stronger military ? @entity4 , a @entity66 member , has the most powerful military in the region			1
@entity39 says @entity4 flies @entity70 - made jets , and that its older equipment has been upgraded and supplemented with early - warning radar airplanes and unmanned drones			2
@entity4 also has a formidable ground force that has spent decades fighting the @entity76 separatist rebels of the @entity77 in the southeast of the country			2
analysis : @entity81 add explosive element to @entity2 equation despite their robust military capability , and despite the fact the @entity2 army has been worn down by 18 months of civil war , @entity39 says @entity2 's missile capabilities mean @entity4 's not interested in anything more than limited border excursions			1
" @entity4 would n't want to tangle with the @entity2 , who do still have the ultimate deterrent of long - range chemical weapons capabilities , " he told @entity0			1
what weapons do @entity2 forces have ? where are they coming from ? @entity2 's greatest strength has also been its weakness in the current fight against rebels			1
the @entity7 regime spent years buying up sophisticated long range missiles , air defense systems and chemical weapons to counter the threat of an airborne attack from @entity107			0
but the long - term focus on long range weaponry has left the regime unprepared to fight a guerrilla war in the streets of @entity2 cities -- an approach that requires flexible , mobile infantry with stockpiles of smaller arms			2
@entity2 has been the @entity40 's top importer of @entity119 weaponry , most of which is now more than 20 years old -- and @entity39 says the @entity2 air force has been underfunded to the point of " regime forces dropping what amount to @entity125 ( improvised explosive devices ) from helicopters			1
" recently , @entity2 has attempted to get some of its @entity129 attack helicopters refurbished by @entity119 -- a move which prompted an international outcry -- and has ordered @entity133 advanced training jets and @entity135 fighter jets that have yet to be delivered			2
while the @entity137 has pledged not to deliver new weapons to @entity2 , it is unclear whether the @entity7 regime will get the weapons it ordered before the uprising began last year			0
@entity2 's heavy weaponry and battle tanks may be @entity119 made , but wars of attrition like this also require huge amounts of small arms			1
to that end , @entity149 -- @entity2 's other major regional ally -- has been using @entity152 airspace to fly small arms , infantry weaponry and personnel into @entity2 , according to @entity157 officials			1
analysis : what does @entity149 get for supporting @entity7 ? @entity152 says it is conducting random searches on @entity2 - bound @entity149 planes that use its airports , but as @entity39 points out , " the @entity152 do n't have any way to force @entity149 planes to land			0
" in addition to the tanks and troops fanned out across the country , @entity2 has also deployed communications interception systems to try to track rebels			2
@entity0 reporters who have been on the ground there say for the most part using a cell phone is out of the question , as @entity2 forces can easily triangulate the user 's location			2
what weapons do @entity2 rebels have ? where are they coming from ? the rebels are severely outmatched , and most of their weaponry was either taken from @entity2 military arsenals or obtained from local black markets			1
in addition to individual infantry weapons like ak - 47s , tripod - mounted @entity193 machine guns , and @entity195 grenade launchers -- the ubiquitous shoulder - mounted weapons seen on nightly news reports from conflicts around the world -- @entity39 says rebels have also been seen with @entity202 shoulder - launched surface - to - air missiles			0
rebels have also commandeered @entity2 tanks , but since they do n't generally have the capacity to maintain and refuel them , according to @entity39 , they 've instead been stripping off the heavier guns and mounting them on civilian vehicles			2
@entity39 says the increasing number of improvised weapons and explosives being used in @entity2 shows the rebels , without a foreign power to supply them , may be struggling to maintain adequate levels of ammunition			0
" some of the weapons in @entity2 look very similar to what we 've seen in the last year in @entity152 , where they 've finally ran out of all the ordinates that were lying around from the 2003 @entity157 invasion and have had to improvise , " he told @entity0			0
what other groups are operating in @entity2 ? @entity222 , an analyst at @entity223 and @entity224 , says militant groups " of all persuasions " are now operating in @entity2 -- and that some groups increasingly appear to be carrying out joint co-ordinated attacks			0
while @entity222 says the majority of the militias now in @entity2 are not @entity233 extremists , analysts believe a hard - line jihadist group known as @entity235 , which has claimed responsibility for a string of recent suicide attacks across @entity2 , has close links with @entity241 's affiliate in @entity152			0
" their focus now is on recruiting suicide bombers			0
they want to copycat the @entity251 model , " @entity244 , a former @entity246 jihadist now with the @entity247 in @entity248 , told @entity0			0
more : @entity253 group steps up bombings the " @entity251 model " refers to the devastating campaign launched by @entity241 in @entity256 leader @entity251 after @entity157 troops occupied @entity152			0
at the same time , @entity76 militias now control at least 10 towns and cities in north - eastern @entity2 , some near the @entity4 border -- an issue @entity222 says is " of significant concern to @entity265 " , which has been battling @entity76 separatists along its borders for decades			2
report : @entity4 's @entity76 conflict turns deadlier is @entity7 losing control of the @entity2 army ? not yet , it seems			1
despite some high profile defections , @entity39 says " we have n't seen significant @entity2 army units going across to join the rebellion			1
" @entity39 says : " the speculation is that the @entity2 army is focused on keeping itself together more than deploying some of the potentially less reliable units into rebel held areas			1
" like most of the nation itself , the majority of @entity2 's conscripted army is @entity285			1
rather than send some less - than - keen battalions in to kill their own countrymen , @entity39 says the approach may be to have the army bombard cities from afar , before sending in loyal militias to do the up - close fighting street to street			0
" you give the militias the weapons and the mobility , and you just make sure that the army units which are largely @entity285 conscripts just stay together , " he told @entity0			0
the plan seems to be working ; @entity39 says many people have been surprised at how well the army has managed to maintain its cohesion during the rebellion			0
is @entity2 going to end up like @entity246 ? the world cheered the fall of @entity246 dictator @entity307 -- but what has been left in his place are a number of well - armed militias operating beyond the control of a relatively weak central government operating in the capital @entity315			1
analysts do n't believe the @entity7 regime is in danger of collapse any time soon -- @entity2 's army is bigger and better organized than @entity307 's was in @entity246 , and foreign intervention into the civil war seems extremely unlikely at this point			1
but if the regime does fold at some point , @entity39 says the weapons proliferation in @entity2 is going to be far worse than in @entity246			2
" @entity2 has a much bigger military , more missiles and chemical weapons , and the potential for major sectarian violence , " he said			0
" so it 's a little like @entity246 , but potentially much , much worse			2
" information from @entity332 and @entity0 's @entity333 was used in this report .			0

@entity66 country @entity4 has most powerful military in the region
@entity2 has long been the @entity40 's top importer of @entity119 military equipment
rebels are mostly surviving on black market guns and arms taken from @entity2 's military
analyst says fall of heavily armed @entity2 army would lead to worse situation than @entity246
