the parents of @entity1 , whose death this year created a mystery that has gripped a @entity5 town , held a rally at the state @entity7 on wednesday , a day after filing a complaint with the state about the handling of their son 's body			1
the " who killed @entity16 " rally had several scheduled speakers , according to a news release from the @entity1 family , but the rev. @entity22 and the rev. @entity23 -- both of whom were slated to address the demonstrators , the family said -- never spoke			2
that did n't stop more than 100 protesters from assembling at the @entity7 before noon			2
@entity1 was found dead in a rolled - up gym mat at his high school in @entity29 , @entity30 , on january 11			1
the @entity31 conducted an autopsy and ruled the death accidental , but his family questioned the ruling and had his body exhumed for a second autopsy			2
at the second autopsy , it was discovered that his organs were missing and his body cavity was filled with newspapers , contrary to industry practice			2
the family 's complaint , filed tuesday with the @entity45 , a division of the secretary of state 's office , alleges that @entity48 mishandled @entity1 's body and specifically accuses director @entity50 of helping obscure the teen 's cause of death			1
however , the funeral home 's attorney , @entity54 , said in an october letter to @entity57 that coroner @entity58 has already stated that " the accusations and innuendo regarding mr. @entity50 's involvement in the disposition of young mr. @entity1 's internal organs are baseless			2
" according to " @entity71 , " a sentence of which was included in an october letter @entity54 sent to @entity57 , when the organs have been removed in an autopsy , the person handling the body should dry the cavity , " dusting it with hardening compound or embalming powder and then filling it with dry , clean sawdust or cotton mixed with a small quantity of hardening compound or embalming powder			0
" @entity54 conceded at a november interview that newspaper was not listed , but he added , " nor is it precluded as one type of foreign substance that may be introduced into a body for purposes of building it up for public display			0
" gov. @entity90 's office did not respond to questions about whether @entity92 had faith in the local investigation into @entity1 's death or the subsequent @entity31 autopsy			1
asked whether @entity90 would call for a special investigation , spokeswoman @entity97 said , " we have been told that the @entity100 is looking into the case			0
" this is such a tragedy , and we extend our deepest sympathy to this young man 's family and friends			0
it is our hope that the @entity100 will be able to shed some light on the situation			0
" @entity111 , the @entity112 attorney for the @entity113 , said in october that federal authorities would investigate the circumstances behind @entity1 's death			1
the family 's complaint alleges that when @entity1 's body was exhumed for a second autopsy , " all of our son 's inner organs , including his brain , were missing			1
" @entity57 was the first to report the development in october			0
@entity50 has previously told the family that the organs were missing when he took custody of the body after the @entity31 autopsy , and @entity54 said last month that the funeral home " absolutely , positively " did not receive the organs			2
" there is no collusion between mr. @entity50 and any law enforcement			0
in fact , i 'm appalled that anyone would even suggest that , " @entity54 told @entity57			0
@entity139 , a pathologist hired by the @entity1 family 's attorney , further told the family " that our son was stuffed with newspaper			1
at no time did we ever authorize the removal of our son 's inner organs for any purpose whatsoever , " the complaint says			1
@entity48 never informed the family the organs were missing , and the @entity31 said it replaced all of the organs after the autopsy , the complaint alleges			0
@entity50 initially said " one or two organs might be missing , " according to the complaint , but in an october 4 letter to the family 's attorney , @entity159 , @entity50 said the organs had been " destroyed " and " discarded ... before the body was sent back to @entity29 , " where the funeral home took custody of the body			1
" it is our belief that mr. @entity50 , at best , misled us as to the condition of our son 's body , and at worse , is responsible for the removal and destruction of his organs , and , thus , desecration of our son 's body , " the complaint says			1
the family concludes by requesting an investigation and alleging that @entity50 engaged in fraud by misleading the family into believing @entity1 's remains were intact and " facilitated a coverup " that deprived pathologists of " the means by which to determine how he may have died , " the complaint says			1
the funeral home has not commented to @entity57 in the past , but @entity50 said in the october letter to the @entity191 ' attorney that the prosector -- an agent who prepares bodies for pathological examination -- discarded the organs			0
the secretary of state 's office confirmed receiving the @entity191 ' complaint tuesday , but would not comment			0
the @entity45 says all investigations are confidential , but after a formal hearing , several resolutions are possible : it can close the probe and take no action ; it can issue a " letter of concern , " which wo n't be made public ; it can issue a public inspection report ; or it can publicly or privately handle any violation with the funeral home .			0
