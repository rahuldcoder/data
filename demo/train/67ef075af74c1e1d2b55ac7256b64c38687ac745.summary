@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 will decide whether police can take dna samples from criminal suspects following their arrest , a case based on @entity10 law with potentially national implications for the use of a popular investigative tool			1
justices will weigh a challenge to the state 's law by @entity18 , who was convicted of a 2003 rape on @entity10 's @entity20 with the assistance of genetic material obtained following his arrest three years ago on an unrelated assault charge			1
@entity18 moved to suppress the use of the @entity27 on @entity29 grounds , but was ultimately convicted of the rape offense			1
federal law in 1994 created a national database in which local , state , and federal law enforcement agencies could compare and share information on dna matches from convicted felons			1
but courts have been at odds on just when such samples can be collected and the information distributed			1
a divided @entity41 agreed with @entity18 , saying suspects under arrest enjoy a higher level of privacy than a convicted felon			2
this , the court said , outweighed the state 's law enforcement interests			0
the appeals court also said that obtaining @entity18 's dna immediately after arrest was not necessary in identifying him and that the process was more personally invasive than standard fingerprinting			2
state officials asked the @entity2 to intervene , saying the state court ruling " resulted in the loss of a valuable crime - fighting tool			2
" they said that from a law enforcement and forensic perspective , there is no difference between fingerprinting and collecting " biometric information			0
" the @entity2 allowed the @entity10 law to remain in effect in july while appeals from the state were filed , and chief justice @entity68 signaled at the time his tentative support for the measure			1
" collecting dna from individuals arrested for violent felonies provides a valuable tool for investigating unsolved crimes and thereby helping to remove violent offenders from the general population , " @entity68 wrote			0
" crimes for which dna evidence is implicated tend to be serious , and serious crimes cause serious injuries			0
that @entity10 may not employ a duly enacted statute to help prevent these injuries constitutes irreparable harm			2
" @entity68 said at the time there was a " fair prospect " the @entity2 would ultimately find in favor of the state on the search and seizure questions			0
@entity68 said the state appeals decision would resonate beyond @entity10 because dna samples taken on the state level " may otherwise be eligible " for the @entity94 's database			1
" the decision , " @entity68 said " renders the database less effective for other states and the federal government			0
" the @entity10 law is set to expire at the end of 2013			0
a @entity2 ruling is expected by june			0
the case is @entity10 v. @entity18 ( 12 - 207 )			1
