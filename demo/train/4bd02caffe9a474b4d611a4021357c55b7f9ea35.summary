-- the @entity1 plans to ban foreigners from the country 's famed pot shops , a decision @entity7 's tourism industry hopes goes up in smoke			1
the @entity1 @entity9 late last month said the measure was needed to " reduce nuisance and drugs tourism , " arguing that " substance use of minors has to be countered more strongly and that coffee shops have grown into large points of sale of cannabis that are hard to manage			1
" known as the " @entity19 , " the measure will turn coffee shops into private clubs for @entity1 citizens over the age of 18			1
the memberships will last for a minimum of a year , and each shop will have a capped number of members			0
" persons who do not hold @entity1 citizenship will not have access to the coffee shops , " the @entity1 @entity29 said in a statement			1
" the @entity9 expects that closure of coffee shops to foreign drugs tourists will ensure that they no longer travel to the @entity1 to purchase and consume cannabis			1
after all , many of them can use the illegal markets available in their immediate surroundings , " it says			0
the government said the measure also is needed to crack down on drug trafficking near the borders with @entity48 and @entity49			2
" the number of criminal organizations that will be dealt with will be doubled from 20 to 40 % , " the @entity29 said in its statement			0
but even in announcing the tougher stand , the government said @entity1 drug use has " remained more or less stable in the past decade			2
" under the current plan , the measure will go into effect this year in the southern part of the country , and then for the rest of the country in 2012			1
the city of @entity7 , including its mayor , has vowed to fight the measure			1
" the @entity1 government has decided upon this for the whole of the @entity1			2
@entity7 does n't want it , " said @entity67 , a spokeswoman for the @entity68			2
@entity67 added , " coffee shops are not actively promoted by our organization and are not used in order to attract tourists			1
however , the mere idea that one can buy and use soft drugs here is an attractive aspect of @entity7 and its famous spirit of freedom			0
" the @entity81 says the new measure should be dismissed because it discriminates against foreigners			0
the board also says it fears " soft drugs will be sold on the street again , leading to more crime and dangerous situations			0
" the @entity1 is renowned for its coffee shops where anyone over the age of 18 can freely walk in and peruse a menu of marijuana and hashish delicacies			1
customers can purchase up to 5g of cannabis , and it can be smoked in regular joint fashion , as well as by bong and pipes			0
alcohol is strictly prohibited in the shops			0
twenty - three percent of @entity7 tourists say they visit coffee shops during their stays , according to the @entity68			1
" these tourists are an important ( though not most important ) economic factor of @entity7			0
" high times magazine has sponsored the @entity107 for the past 24 years in @entity7 , bringing together thousands of marijuana and hashish enthusiasts in the city known as the " @entity111 " this year 's @entity107 is slated for november 20 - 24 and is not affected by the new measure			2
but the ban could affect next year 's event			0
" as a result , high times is encouraging all who 've always wanted to attend the @entity107 and visit @entity7 to do so this year , " the magazine says on its website .			0
