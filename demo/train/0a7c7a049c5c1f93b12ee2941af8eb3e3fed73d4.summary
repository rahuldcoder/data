@entity0 -- when i was driving through @entity4 last year , all the talk was about a @entity7 company 's failure to complete a major motorway project			1
the contract was wrestled away from the @entity7 and the @entity4 finished it themselves			2
the details , denials and counter-claims are n't important for this article ; far more interesting is the impact of any @entity7 - led project in @entity17			1
any news on such projects -- good or bad -- makes headlines			0
but the splash is bigger when such projects fail or when people starting mumbling about @entity7 influence			2
what @entity7 does in @entity17 matters greatly , though rarely do i hear or read a positive story about @entity7 's influence			1
when a @entity7 company bought @entity31 , it was the transfer of technology that made the headlines , along with the end of the era for a venerable @entity17 brand			1
when an @entity39 company bought @entity40 and @entity41 , @entity37 was hailed as the savior of two venerable @entity17 brands			2
why is that ? the answer appears clear			0
we are equally fascinated and frightened by the rise of @entity7 's economic and military prowess			1
the @entity7 government 's recent trip to central @entity17 revealed that the hiccup in @entity4 has not slowed @entity7 's plan to invest heavily in the former communist states			1
a $ 10 billion credit line will be used for infrastructure projects in @entity4 , @entity56 and other countries			0
it was reported that the leaders of 16 central @entity17 countries met with @entity7 prime minister @entity61 while in @entity4			1
@entity7 's tech giant @entity62 is a growing power in the telecoms world			1
but any attempt it makes to expand in @entity17 , @entity67 or @entity68 is met with fears of technology transfer to a firm linked to the @entity7 military through its founder			1
rightly so , governments fret over a " foreign " firm controlling the hardware that is the backbone of modern society			0
in @entity62 's case , as the economist recently pointed out in a front cover story , the fear is @entity7 illegally tapping into western communications , both government and private			2
of course @entity62 will say it 's a private company with no state control and simply wants to compete on a level playing field with the likes of @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			0
a change of leadership in @entity92 will not have much impact in @entity17			1
there is no reason to believe big changes will come from the top			0
instead , change appears to be coming from the bottom			0
rising wages and increased worker benefits might raise the prices of goods exported to @entity17			2
it also helps to expand @entity7 's middle class which appears to love @entity17 and @entity67 products			1
i recall growing up in @entity67 with worries about the rising power of @entity110			0
all the products we desired were designed there or manufactured there , from video games players to vcrs and automobiles to the @entity117			0
with the wealth created , the @entity110 were buying up property in @entity120 and buildings in @entity122			0
it was feared the rise of @entity110 's economic prowess would never abate			0
@entity17 ca n't assume the same will happen with @entity7			2
but the economies now are so interlinked that stingy @entity17 consumers quickly translates into weaker manufacturing output in @entity7			1
that slowdown is dissected by @entity17 economists and , on any given day , it can cause stocks to fall , leading to the similar stock tumbles a few hours later on @entity135			2
recently @entity138 noted a slowdown in sales in @entity141 , particularly in @entity7 -- its shares promptly fell 20 %			0
perhaps it was an overreaction , but it shows investors are quite happy to plow money into companies with " an @entity141 strategy " and then ignore it -- until there is a profit warning blamed on that same market			0
that goes to show @entity17 has to get comfortable with the growing influence of @entity7 on its shores			1
it can not expect its companies to grow in the @entity7 market , then be surprised when enriched @entity7 companies come shopping for @entity17 companies to buy			2
@entity7 needs to understand that it will take time for @entity17 to get comfortable with @entity7 's investments			1
@entity7 has to make sure its investments and intentions are transparent			0
oh , then there is that small matter of reciprocity .			0

@entity1 's @entity167 writes he hardly hears positive stories about @entity7 's influence in @entity17
@entity17 's and @entity7 's economies are intertwined
a change of leadership in @entity92 will not have much impact in @entity17
