-- @entity2 's perilous democratic transition has been rocked by the ongoing anti-government protests			1
the standoff between the government led by prime minister @entity6 and opposition parties continues to accelerate the political uncertainty and damage the fragile economy			1
@entity6 was elected 14 months ago in an election that witnessed unprecedented voter turnout			2
while most opposition parties accepted the results , @entity12 -- the leader of the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) party -- claimed there was widespread rigging			0
there 's not much evidence , however , beyond the usual irregularities of @entity2 's outmoded electoral system , to back this up			1
but a successful campaign , aided by sections of @entity2 media , to de-legitimize last year 's vote has convinced a large number of people that somehow @entity12 's mandate was " stolen " in 2013			1
another opposition group , @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , led by a @entity2 @entity35 cleric , @entity32 wants a systemic change and has a list of undeliverable promises to the electorate			1
his immediate grievance is the brutal police action against his supporters that left 14 dead in june of this year			0
both the groups have mobilized their supporters since early august and have been camping in @entity48 's red zone -- a high security area where many state buildings and diplomatic missions are located			2
in the last few days the sit - in turned violent as the protestors attempted to enter the parliament and prime minister 's residence , leaving hundreds injured and at least three dead			0
on monday morning , mobs entered the state television premises and managed to suspend the transmission for some time until the military intervened and restored order			0
this was a most embarrassing situation for @entity6 's government as the civilian law enforcement apparatus appeared helpless			1
role of the military in such situations , it is @entity2 's powerful army which usually intervenes ; it has taken over the reins of government four times during country 's 67 - year history			1
relations between @entity2 's prime minister and the military have been far from smooth for months			1
the civilian government and the courts have proceeded to try @entity81 , the former army chief and president for treason			2
in may , the government was seen as sympathetic to the country 's largest television channel that , rather unprofessionally , named the intelligence chief as responsible for an attack on its leading journalist @entity89 , who was shot in @entity90 but survived the alleged assassination attempt			2
under pressure , the government later backtracked and penalized the channel but mistrust grew			0
on key foreign policy issues , such as @entity99 and @entity100 , the government and the military are not on the same page either			1
@entity6 is an ardent advocate of making peace with @entity99 , while the military 's strategic worldview has historically been determined by the threat from @entity99			1
@entity6 has been regularly meeting the army chief , @entity106 , and also consolidating his position by mobilizing other political parties in parliament			1
however , the media , on balance , has critical , in some measure propelled by the high - handed tactics of the government as it quelled protests including beating up journalists in recent days			0
earlier , the protestors have been attacking journalists at will expressing their anger towards media houses viewed as " partisan			0
" there has been chaos all over and even the @entity2 @entity123 mockingly stated that they too could paralyze the country 's capital			1
in the current stalemate the military has maintained an ostensibly neutral position			2
@entity2 's @entity130 news service described this as a " carefully constructed veneer " and suggested the military may not be fully siding with the government , which the constitution says it must do			1
the army has issued three statements in the past week wherein it has emphasized dialogue and negotiation with @entity12 and @entity32 , as well as avoiding the use of force			0
game changer ? on monday , the former head of @entity12 's party , @entity143 , claimed the recent turmoil was planned by the protesting parties with the backing of sections within the army and possibly judges from the country 's top court			2
but in a carefully worded statement , the army reiterated its position as " an apolitical institution " and reminded all of " its unequivocal support for democracy at numerous occasions			0
" however , this has been a game changer of sorts as it allows the civilian government to reassert its political power			0
the recent breach of security at parliament and other state installations in @entity48 did not result in any attempt by the military to repel protestors			2
yet the military is concerned about its image			0
it has regained its popularity by conducting operations against militants along its border with @entity100 , and also by regaining its space in a powerful broadcast media that had played a pivotal role in ousting @entity81 in 2007 - 8			0
but @entity6 is fighting back and has convened a special session of the parliament on tuesday , which is likely to reiterate support for him			2
a parliamentary committee will restart negotiations with the protestors			0
a coup may not be imminent			0
until recently , it was widely speculated that @entity6 may be forced to resign , given the turn of events			0
but @entity6 might come out of this crisis as a weakened prime minister with the military controlling foreign and security policies			1
having said that @entity2 's political history is fraught with unexpected events ; and continued standoff may lead to a further meltdown where the army shall act as the sole arbiter of political events			1
meanwhile , the majority of @entity2 crave stability .			0

standoff between government and opposition *creates* uncertainty , damages economy
@entity2 's powerful army often intervenes but has so far remained neutral
however , a coup can not be completely ruled out
*pm* @entity6 might come out of crisis weakened with the military controlling foreign and security policies
