the moon has risen , and it 's quiet around this little @entity4 village			1
past a field of tilled soil and over a stone wall in a little brick house , the children have been put to bed and there is a kettle on the stove			0
a woman speaks in a hushed voice on the phone			0
her voice is tired but full of emotion			0
another woman rises with the dawn and slips a scarf over her hair as she steps into the dew of a new morning			0
she ushers the livestock with a rough wooden stick to the point of gathering -- from there , the village shepherd will take the animals out to pasture			1
still another woman , with aged hands and a furrowed brow , is bent low over a pile of potatoes			0
she peels them tirelessly as she prepares food for her family			0
in the @entity4 village of @entity42 , you will find many hard - working women , but you will not find many men			1
all these women 's husbands are thousands of miles away			1
because of the poor economic situation of this village , 90 % of its working - age men have left for better - paying construction jobs in @entity52			1
so for eight or nine months a year , women run the village			1
a grit and strength sustain them as they bravely take care of not only their families , but also their village as a whole			1
photographer @entity62 had been working in the @entity63 when he heard rumors of towns without men			1
he and his translator did some investigating and found the stories were true			0
he spent two weeks in september 2013 documenting the lives of the women of @entity71			1
social media follow @ @entity73 on @entity74 to join the conversation about photography			0
@entity62 stayed with @entity77 and @entity78 , two sisters - in - law who lived together with their families while their husbands worked in @entity52			1
he captured painterly scenes of the village with his @entity84 film camera , only using his digital camera in low - lighting situations			2
" that 's why i love film , " he said			2
" you do n't need to do post-production to get some beautiful colors			0
" and indeed he has captured the feeling of a bygone era			0
the colors and lighting give the images a storybook quality			0
there is a great sense of community among the women			2
everything is a team effort , from working the land , uprooting vegetables , herding the livestock across dirt roads , sheering curly - haired sheep , baking flat bread and raising wide - eyed little ones			2
now this is not to say that there are no men whatsoever in @entity42			2
look under the shade of a cool brick wall , and you can find the older generation wearing caps and denim as they tell stories and play cards on splintery wooden tables			0
these men serve as a source of authority over unruly schoolboys and provide support for their daughters - in - law			2
but even @entity62 says it is still " the women who do everything			1
" in the beginning , @entity132 and @entity78 did n't discuss the emotional toll this separation takes on them			0
but by the end , they acknowledged that while most of the women in the town do trust their husbands , there is still an underlying fear that the men may lead a secret life in @entity52			1
worse yet is that some of the men never return			2
" we try not to think too much about that , " the women told him			2
while there is a great deal of determined patience required for both the husbands and wives , the winter months are a time of pure celebration			0
when the men return at the end of the year , the village is filled with weddings , parties and births			1
it 's a time of joyful reuniting			0
( although @entity62 said he overheard stories of children who did not recognize their fathers when they returned			1
) those three months together are savored before the husbands , sons and fathers will pack their suitcases and leave for the majority of another year			1
again , the women will unwaveringly take the helm of this village			1
despite the fiscal hardships , the exhausting manual labor and the lonely pangs they face , they remain strong and full of love			0
@entity62 is a photographer based in @entity183			1
he is a member of the @entity184			0
