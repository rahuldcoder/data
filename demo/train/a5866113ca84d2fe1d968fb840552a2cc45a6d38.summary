two identities and the ever - present , very real risk of death			2
that was the life of @entity6 , a radical @entity7 turned double agent , who 's now lifting the lid on some of the world 's best - kept secrets			1
his life is the stuff of spy novels , and he talks about it in his book : " @entity19 : my @entity22 and the @entity23 , " co-authored by @entity0 terrorism analyst @entity20 and @entity21			1
both men are @entity0 contributors			2
he also recently sat down with @entity0 senior international correspondent @entity27			2
" i had these different names			2
i had different personalities , " @entity19 said			2
" i was @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33			1
" he was so trusted by senior @entity22 leaders he once fixed one up with a @entity37 wife , all the while -- storm claims -- working for @entity41 intelligence agencies			1
" for half a decade , i moved back and forth between two worlds and two identities -- when one misplaced sentence could have cost me my life , " he writes in the book			2
" traveling between atheism and hardline @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			2
" " it 's some kind of schizophrenic lifestyle , " he said			2
excerpt : finding a wife for @entity55 growing up storm 's remarkable journey began rather unremarkably in @entity58 , in a town called @entity60			1
it 's a place with plenty of places for a young boy to play and @entity6 remembers , fondly , his time in the forest and on the beach			2
he also remembers struggling with the absence of his father			2
storm started getting into trouble early			1
as a teen , he committed armed robbery and got into fighting , feeding off the adrenaline of both			2
" boxing for me was a way of getting out my aggressions , " said @entity19 , who did n't limit his fights to the ring			2
by his 18th birthday , he 'd landed himself in jail			2
after he got out , @entity6 joined the @entity84 , a biker gang , working as its muscle			2
his life was going nowhere good -- and fast			2
finding ' truth ' storm 's trajectory changed after he found a book on the life of the @entity93 in the tiny religion section at the @entity60 library			1
it spoke to me , that book			0
this is the truth , " he said			0
" i found the truth			0
" storm became @entity31 and traveled to @entity102 , where he learned @entity50 and a strict uncompromising interpretation of @entity48			1
he named his son after @entity105			0
storm dove head first into the world of jihad , traveling with @entity58 journalist @entity110 , who wanted to shoot a film about mujahedeen in @entity102			1
while there , storm befriended @entity102 - @entity115 cleric @entity55 , who was poised to become a key member of @entity117 and a major @entity115 target			1
" they were joking , sitting and telling stories -- joking about some of the stuff that they missed in the @entity41 countries , " @entity110 said about storm and @entity55			1
" they talked a lot about jihad , for example			0
and again , @entity6 was an extreme guy			0
storm was being talked down by @entity55 , " @entity110 said			1
" @entity131 was telling @entity6 to chill out			0
" undeterred , storm decided to join jihadists in @entity134 , but , at the last minute , he got a call telling him not to come			1
the situation on the ground had grown too dangerous			0
" i 'm so deeply disappointed , and devastated , " @entity19 told @entity0			0
" and in his disappointment , doubt began to grow			0
switching sides sitting in front of a laptop , @entity6 typed in some of his concerns			1
" i hit the ' enter ' and i saw plenty of websites talking about contradictions in the @entity147 , " he said			0
" it took some time to research them , but once i concluded that they were genuinely contradictions , that 's when it wiped totally away my faith , " storm said			1
" that 's when i stopped being a @entity156 in my heart -- in my belief			0
" he got in touch with @entity58 intelligence agents and told them he wanted a new career			0
no longer a @entity156 , storm said he wanted to help fight the war on terror			1
agents wasted no time putting him to work , making him an agent in demand			1
his successes , @entity6 says , soon attracted the attention of the @entity23			0
@entity172 is the former head of the @entity58 intelligence agency , known as @entity174			0
" there 's no doubt that he was a very valuable agent and has access to some of the sources they really want to get access to , " he said			1
a @entity58 who looks every inch like his @entity184 ancestors , storm was exactly what the intelligence community was looking for at the time -- a double agent with an @entity188 to match			1
the @entity23 denied repeated requests for comment on @entity6 's story			0
likewise , officials in @entity58 have never confirmed or denied his claims			0
" by almost sheer luck to some extent that he had been to the many places ; he had met all the right people , " @entity194 , one of @entity196 's top counterterrorism experts , said about storm			1
" i do n't think that there are many people like him that have all those different dimensions			0
he was the real deal , " @entity194 said			0
playing matchmaker storm 's authenticity was tested by both sides when @entity55 asked him to find a @entity37 blonde to be his third wife			1
his search led to @entity216 , from @entity217 , a recent convert to @entity48 who called herself @entity219			0
the plan was a basic honey trap			0
the blonde was to be bait -- an unsuspecting sacrificial lamb , to lure and kill a lustful @entity22 leader			1
through storm , @entity55 and @entity227 exchange encrypted emails and swapped videos			1
for his troubles , @entity6 says he was promised and received $ 250,000 when @entity227 crossed into @entity102 , unknowingly carrying a tracking device hidden inside of a suitcase			0
he later got an email from @entity55 , who wrote that he had married @entity227 and that she was better than he had hoped			0
however , @entity6 also got an email from @entity227			0
she wrote that @entity55 had told her to dump the suitcase before they met			0
she had left both it and the tracking device behind			0
@entity6 says his @entity23 handlers were furious : " the @entity115 refused to speak to me for six months			1
" but , @entity19 says , they came around			0
hunting for any leads on @entity22 , @entity6 says , the @entity23 continued to seek out his help , promising as much as $ 5 million for information leading to the capture or death of @entity55			1
going public @entity131 was eventually tracked down and killed in a @entity115 drone strike in 2011			1
his wife , @entity227 , reached out to storm via email and told him that she offered to become a suicide bomber but had been rebuffed			1
@entity0 tried to reach @entity227 through her family , but they would not talk to us			0
also , a @entity37 counterterrorism official tells @entity0 that a threat bulletin had been issued at the time , warning that @entity227 could be a danger			0
but storm insists it was his work that finally found @entity260			1
but in a conversation taped by storm at a hotel that same year , an @entity115 insisted that a separate stream of intelligence had led to the terror leader			1
the bottom line : storm was not going to be paid the $ 5 million he felt he was owed			1
his relationship with his handlers deteriorated and , @entity6 says , he eventually stopped working for the @entity23 and the @entity58 intelligence agency @entity174			1
the latter tried to buy his silence after it learned he was considering going public with his story			1
storm claims the @entity58 intelligence agency offered payments totaling 1.5m @entity58 krone ( $ 260,000 ) over five years			1
he told the @entity58 newspaper @entity282 that @entity174 had offered him the money tax - free			0
but he said he rejected the deal because @entity174 had broken a series of promises to him , including providing permanent residence status in @entity58 for his foreign wife			2
after so many years playing so many different parts , @entity6 's toughest role may lie ahead : staying alive			0
he is in hiding after several death threats from militant islamists who were once his comrades			0
the threat was made abundantly clear last year when @entity297 fighters in @entity298 issued a video in which they shot at a picture of him attached to a wall			0
" either they will slice your throat , behead you , or they shoot you and hang you up and crucify you , " storm said about his time as a spy			2
" i would get executed			0
