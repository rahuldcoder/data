@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 cellphone giant @entity3 on tuesday unveiled its latest range of smartphones as it bids to recover lost ground to rivals @entity9 and @entity10			1
the launch follows a series of major changes at board level , with the recent resignations of chief executive @entity16 and smartphone operations chief @entity17			0
last week it was announced that @entity19 , who previously headed up @entity21 's @entity20 , would take over from @entity16 on september 20 , while @entity17 , who is credited for revamping the company 's smartphone business , would remain in his post until a replacement is found			0

that renewal process continued at tuesday 's @entity48 showcase in @entity0 , when three new smartphones -- the @entity50 , @entity51 and the @entity52 -- were introduced			1
like the flagship n8 model , unveiled earlier this year , the sleek new devices are powered by a new @entity32 3 operating system which offers hundreds of new features such as the ability to play high definition video through your phone to your wide screen tv at home			1
@entity32 is already the most widely used operating system for mobiles in the world , but @entity3 admits competitors such as @entity9 and @entity67 have started to catch up			1
" today our fight back to smartphone leadership shifts into high gear , " @entity68 , @entity3 's markets chief , told delegates in @entity0			2
" despite new competition , @entity32 remains the most widely used smartphone platform in the world			2
our new family of smartphones introduced today feature the all - new @entity32 , rewritten to be faster , easier to use , more efficient and more developer friendly			1
" however technology journalist @entity80 , who attended @entity48 , told @entity2 that he feels @entity3 may stem the loss of market share with their latest offerings but this is " basically a band - aid			0
" he added : " what @entity3 is actually saying is @entity87 , their next big announcement and operating system , is really going to shake up the competitors			1
" but i 'm not hearing anyone from any country raving about the new products at the moment			0

" what about the rest of the family ? -- described as the " ultimate business smartphone , " the @entity50 boasts direct , real - time and secure access to corporate email inboxes and other personal applications via its four - inch display with slide - out keyboard			0
-- the @entity51 " social - networking smartphone " provides live updates from social networks such as @entity114 and @entity115 on its 3.5 - inch touch - screen display			0
-- the @entity52 offers a more compact experience which combines elements taken from its bigger cousins , such as a front - facing camera and @entity124 technology for improved outdoor visibility			0

@entity3 also announced a number of improvements in developer tools making it simpler , easier and more lucrative for people to build and distribute apps			1
last week @entity9 announced it would be removing its unpopular restrictions on what programming tools developers can use to create @entity146 apps			2
according to analysts , this means programmers will be able to use tools from @entity9 's rivals -- most notably @entity150 -- to build software for @entity9 's iphones , @entity153 and ipods			2
" we have listened to our developers and taken much of their feedback to heart , " @entity9 told @entity155			0
