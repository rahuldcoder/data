-- when he was 6 weeks old , @entity1 lay flat on a restaurant table , his skin turning blue			1
his father , @entity5 , was furiously pumping his chest , trying to get air into his son 's lungs			2
within 30 minutes , @entity1 was admitted to a local hospital			1
doctors concluded that he had probably breathed food or liquid into his lungs and eventually released him			2
but two days later , it happened again			2
it was the beginning of an ordeal for the @entity21 , @entity20 , family that continued day after agonizing day			2
" they had to do cpr on him every day , " said @entity23 , @entity1 's mother , who later found out her son had a rare obstruction in his lungs called bronchial malacia			1
" i did n't think he was going to leave the hospital alive			2
" with hopes dimming that @entity1 would survive , doctors tried the medical equivalent of a " @entity35 " pass			1
using an experimental technique never before tried on a human , they created a splint made out of biological material that effectively carved a path through @entity1 's blocked airway			1
what makes this a medical feat straight out of science fiction : the splint was created on a three - dimensional printer			1
" it 's magical to me , " said dr. @entity48 , an associate professor of pediatric otolaryngology at the @entity49 who implanted the splint in @entity51			2
" we 're talking about taking dust and using it to build body parts			2
" @entity1 's procedure was described in a letter published in the most recent issue of the @entity59			1
" it was pretty nifty that ( doctors ) were able to make something for @entity1 on a printer like that , " @entity23 said			1
" but we really were n't so worried about that			0
we were more worried about our son			0
" toddler gets new windpipe from her own stem cells @entity48 , who has been practicing for two decades , and a @entity49 colleague , biomedical engineer @entity70 , had been working for years toward a clinical trial to test the splint in children with pulmonary issues when they got a phone call from a physician in @entity20 who was aware of their research			2
" he said , ' i 've got a child who needs ( a splint ) now , ' " referring to @entity1 , said @entity48			1
" he said that this child is not going to live unless something is done			0
" @entity48 and @entity70 got emergency clearance from their hospital and the @entity85 to try the experimental treatment -- which had been used only on animals -- on @entity1			1
the child was airlifted from @entity88 to @entity89 at @entity49 " it was a mixture of elation and , for lack of a better word , terror , " said @entity70 , a professor of biomedical and mechanical engineering who has been studying tissue regeneration for more than 15 years			0
" when someone drops something like this in your lap and says , ' look , this might be this kid 's only chance ' ... it 's a big step			0
" the next big step was getting a ct scan of @entity1 's lungs so that the splint could be fitted to his organs ' exact dimensions			1
@entity70 used the results of the scan to generate a computer model of the splint			2
the model was fed into a 3 - d printer that can engineer structures using a powder called polycaprolactone , or @entity120			1
@entity120 is malleable ; it can be fashioned into all kinds of intricate structures			0
when a splint is created using @entity120 , it becomes a sort of biological placeholder , propping up structures while the body heals around it			1
@entity120 has been used for years to fill holes left behind in the skull after brain surgery , according to @entity70			0
as time passes , @entity120 degrades and is excreted out of the body , hopefully leaving behind a healed organ			0
what followed in @entity1 's case was a painstaking process of creating the splint on the printer in layers			1
information about each layer is transmitted from the computer to a laser beam , which melts the @entity120 into a @entity145 structure			0
" we can put together a complete copy of a body part on the 3 - d printer within a day , " @entity48 said			1
" so we can make something very specific for a patient very quickly			0
" @entity48 then took the splint , measuring just a few centimeters long and 8 millimeters wide , and surgically attached it to @entity1 's collapsed bronchus			1
it was only moments before he saw the results			0
" when the stitches were put in , we started seeing the lung inflate and deflate , " @entity48 said			0
" it was so fabulous			0
there were people in the operating room cheering			0
" " this case is a wonderful example that regenerative technologies are no longer science fiction , " said dr. @entity163 , director of the @entity164 , who was not involved in @entity1 's case			1
" we are increasingly ... finding new solutions that we did n't have before			0
" the technique used by @entity48 and @entity70 is part of a burgeoning field called regenerative medicine , which involves engineering therapies -- using things like stem cells , or " body parts " constructed out of biological material -- to harness the body 's ability to heal itself			0
creating a part that is specific to a patient 's organ takes on even more importance with diseases like bronchial malacia , in which conventional intervention is risky and often the alternative is life on a ventilator			0
but while cases like @entity1 's are a medical boon , both @entity163 and the @entity49 researchers stress that this and other regenerative procedures must be replicated in a wider patient population			1
" this gives us the opportunity to really do patient - specific and individualized medicine , " @entity70 said			2
" so we do n't have to do one - size - fits - all			2
but there is still a lot of work to be done			0
" while that work is being done , @entity1 's family remains grateful that , 15 months post-surgery and at age 18 months , he is still able to breathe on his own			1
" i 'm just so happy he 's still here , that he was able to make it through , " @entity23 said			0
" hopefully ( soon ) he 'll be able to run around and be an even happier child			0
" the splint will take three years to degrade , and in the meantime , @entity1 's lung should continue to develop normally , said @entity48			1
@entity48 and @entity70 hope to begin clinical trials in a larger patient population this year or next .			0

@entity1 stopped breathing daily and had to receive cpr
doctors tried the equivalent of a " @entity35 " pass
they created a splint on a 3 - d printer to enable him to breathe
