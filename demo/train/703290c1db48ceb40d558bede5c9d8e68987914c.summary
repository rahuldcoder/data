-- how much do you love your city ? enough to write a love letter to it ? so much that you 'd tattoo that love letter on your body ? the @entity9 , which will leave hundreds of residents branded with an ode to their town , is the brainchild of artists @entity15 and @entity16 , professors at @entity17 in @entity19 's second largest city			1
" for years to come , this is a commitment to @entity21 , " @entity15 said			1
their fascination with tattooing as an art form started a few years ago when they co-taught a class called " @entity28 , " a course built around understanding -- and challenging -- the cultural and social conventions that dictate our lives			2
one of their most thought - provoking assignments asked students to place temporary but realistic - looking tattoos in a visible place on their body			2
they were then asked to visit a business and apply for a job			0
@entity15 and @entity16 said students came back with mixed responses ; some felt like a conversation piece , others felt discriminated against			0
@entity15 and @entity16 acted as canvasses along with their students ; @entity16 chose to wear the fake tattoos off and on for two years			0
" what was interesting to us , as well , was how our gender would affect how we are perceived , " @entity16 said			0
" people were a lot more interested in my tattoos , but they looked at @entity15 like he was a criminal			0
" decoding the workplace dress code this go - round , they decided to take it one step further , using the words of a local poet for an installation of permanent tattoos to be inked on @entity21 residents			1
poet @entity67 crafted a contrapuntal work -- a three - part piece in which the reader can view the left column as one poem , the right column as another poem , and both columns together as a third poem			1
the title : " the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ of the universe : a @entity80			0
" " it did n't start off as a love letter , " @entity67 confided			1
" i 've been off and on in @entity21 for about 20 years			1
like any relationship , you have your ups and downs with the city			0
i tried not to think that people were going to have it tattooed on their body			1
" @entity67 enlisted social media to fill in the blank : " @entity21 is the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ of the universe			1
" some of the responses were poetic , others were downright bizarre -- read " errant nipple hair " and " b - list cult movie			0
" still , @entity15 and @entity16 found someone to agree to be inked with every phrase and punctuation mark in the 496 - word poem ( including the title )			2
apparently this matters : face tattoos participants submitted their top three phrases and @entity15 and @entity16 narrowed it down from there ; they say only about 15 - 20 people had to resubmit phrases because they were n't available anymore			0
@entity67 participated in the project , too , choosing the phrase " gravitational pull " for a permanent spot on her left foot			1
" i got that one because every time i tried to leave @entity21 , something pulled me back -- as if my work here is not yet done , " said 31 - year - old @entity67			1
in all , 248 participants will put their love for @entity21 in ink			1
more than 60 people were first - time tattoo recipients ( including the professors themselves )			2
the oldest participant is 65			0
tattoos and piercings : how young is too young ? the tattoos were done by @entity131 and @entity132 at @entity133 , gratis , thanks to local sponsors			2
" i loved the idea of a small part of the city that i call home coming together and using tattooing as the medium for the sake of a community art project , " said @entity136 , 36 , a participant in the project			2
@entity136 chose to put the phrase " @entity148 " along his left forearm			0
it was his 25th tattoo			0
@entity136 's twin brother , @entity151 , also decided to participate in the project after learning about it from his brother			2
opting for the phrase , " the @entity156 , " @entity151 said the decision to partake was a no - brainer			0
" i have left here many times , moving to @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 , always ending up back home in @entity21 , " @entity151 said			1
" i wanted to be a part of something that was local and also original -- this was it			2
@entity21 is one of the few consistencies in my life and will call it home for a very long time			1
" while tattoos have infiltrated popular culture , to some they will always remain taboo			0
" i think the stigma , at a very base level , is because the @entity174 tells us not to , " @entity15 said			0
much of the project 's backlash comes from people quoting the book of @entity180 : " you shall not make any cuts on your body for the dead or tattoo yourselves : i am the lord			2
" on the flip side , the artists say the project has galvanized pride in @entity21			1
" what we hope for is to create a community of people who are connected to each other but also to @entity21 , " @entity16 said			1
the @entity196 project will premiere in the fall with a short film that highlights each tattoo ; it will also unveil a hidden image built within the circle patterns surrounding the tattoos			1
the final tattoo will be completed in the coming weeks			0
the poet 's mother - in - law will get a tattoo that says " by @entity67			1
" would you show pride for your hometown with a tattoo ? let us know in the comments			0
