-- the @entity2 @entity1 made a landmark ruling thursday upholding the controversial , massive reform of health care coverage initiated by president @entity6			1
here are four things @entity2 learned about the federal government 's grand vision to ensure health care for everyone under so - called @entity12 : skipping insurance no longer an option the individual mandate is the centerpiece of the @entity12 , the @entity6 administration 's signature law			1
the mandate , which the high court let stand , requires most @entity2 to have health care insurance			1
opponents had contended that the government could n't force citizens to buy health coverage , but the @entity1 ruled thursday that the individual mandate is legal under the government 's taxing powers			1
the " tax " comes in the form of a financial penalty on certain individuals who do not obtain health insurance , and the @entity32 allows for such a tax , the court said			2
the justices , however , found problems in how the law threatens to remove @entity39 funding -- the government 's health coverage for the poor -- from states that do n't participate in an expansion of eligibility			1
the court said that the government must remove that threat , and @entity6 acknowledged remedies are needed			0
the year 2014 is the deadline for everyone to get insurance			2
not obtaining insurance in 2014 will cost a person $ 95 or 1 % of his or her income , whichever is higher			0
in 2015 , it 's $ 325 , or 2 % of income			2
for families , the penalty will be $ 285 per household or 1 % of income , whichever is greater			0
by 2016 , it goes up to $ 2,085 per family or 2.5 % of income			0
penalties will rise each year			2
health care ruling gives @entity67 new attack line -- taxes the law promises improved collective health the law does promise better care and better health for @entity2 -- at a cost			1
federal health spending is projected to grow from 5.6 % of gross domestic product in 2011 to about 9.4 % by 2035 , according to the @entity78			2
under the law , preventive care services such as mammograms , physical exams , colonoscopies and vaccinations will be fully covered by insurance companies			1
this requirement kicked in for new health insurance plans that began on or after september 2010			2
without the individual mandate , 40 million @entity2 would have remained uninsured , researchers at the @entity90 's @entity89 estimated			1
had the health care law been struck down by the high court , those without insurance would have grown by millions , researchers at the @entity90 said			1
without the law , " in the worst case scenario , the number of uninsured @entity2 would increase to 57.7 million in 2014 and to 65.7 million in 2019			1
in the best case , the number grows to 53.1 million in 2014 and 57 million in 2019 , " the researchers wrote			0
' @entity12 ' symbol : court ruling is ' right direction ' uninsured not the only ones who 'll see a change many @entity2 are already covered by employers ' health benefits			1
at companies with fewer than 50 workers , the employees must obtain insurance themselves			0
companies with 50 or more full - time employees must start providing health insurance for all workers by 2014 or face stiff penalties			2
cash - strapped entrepreneurs can buy insurance at state exchanges and can get tax credits if their annual individual income ranges between 100 % and 400 % of the poverty line , which this year translates to $ 11,170 and $ 44,680			1
solo entrepreneurs and small businesses can shop for less expensive insurance through the exchanges in each state			0
one - person businesses can also turn to exchanges for individuals			0
companies with up to 100 workers may turn to @entity135			0
both keep down costs by increasing the size of the insured pool and spreading out the risk			0
no exchange is up and running yet			0
in theory , though , the exchanges will give small firms the ability to buy insurance at rates once belonging to large companies			0
by the numbers : health insurance both parties will look to benefit politically from ruling on thursday , @entity67 indicated that the health care law will be a major issue in this year 's presidential election			1
@entity6 , a @entity156 , agreed			0
@entity67 presidential candidate @entity157 said that , if elected , he would seek to overturn the law			2
both candidates were leveraging the conflict to raise money for their respective campaigns			0
" what the court did not do on the last day in session , i will do on my first day if elected president of the @entity2 , and that is that i will act to repeal @entity12 , " @entity157 said two hours after the ruling was handed down			2
despite his pledge to repeal the law , if elected , @entity157 has promised to continue some of the law 's consumer protections , such as the ban on preventing care based on pre-existing conditions			1
said @entity6 : " i know that there will be a lot discussion about this , about who won and who lost			0
that 's how these things tend to be viewed here in @entity184			0
but that discussion completely misses the point			0
" he said thursday that the principle upheld by the high court 's ruling is that no @entity2 should go bankrupt because of illness			1
opinion : are voters ready to move on ? what the health care ruling means to you @entity0 's @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			1

the controversial individual mandate is deemed *constitutional* as a tax matter
@entity2 must have health care coverage -- or face fines
the ruling will continue to play a role this year 's presidential election
the law will allow more people access to preventive screening
