" we 've gotten the strongest forward order book that we 've ever had			0
it 's the best outlook we 've ever had since we 've started the company , " said @entity12 , sales and marketing director for @entity15 , a leading @entity17 manufacturer and re-fitter of superyachts			1
amid the global recession , the worldwide market for luxury goods has plummeted over the last year , expected to shrink 10 percent for 2009 according to global business consultants @entity26			1
a few sectors , though , have shown surprising strength and even growth amid the downturn , including @entity17 - made superyachts			1
the @entity17 market for superyachts grew more than 15 percent during the fiscal year ending june 1 , 2009 , according to a new survey			1
overall revenue increased to a record $ 663 million ( £ 410 million ) and jobs across the industry increased five percent , according to @entity38 , the trade group who conducted the survey			1
since last september , yacht sales tanked in many parts of the world , particularly as cash dried up among clients from @entity45 and the @entity46			2
" it was a difficult year , many manufacturers had to cut down on production numbers and give larger discounts , " said @entity47 , head of sales and @entity49 , a manufacturer of superyachts based in @entity51			1
in @entity59 three of the four publicly - traded yacht companies who make yachts that cost more than $ 40 million took advantage of the country 's bankruptcy laws to stave off collapse , including @entity64 , the company who built @entity67 's yacht " @entity68			1
" though affected by the recession , the @entity17 industry managed to buck that trend , buoyed by a decline in the pound			2
" in the last quarter of 2008 through the end of first quarter 2009 there was virtually zero activity in the large yacht sector , " said @entity74 , director of @entity75 , a @entity17 - based high - end boat manufacturer			1
@entity74 said that at their worst , transactions were down 60 percent compared with the previous year , but that volume had recently returned , particularly in brokerage sales of used yachts			1
heading into @entity87 , manufacturers around the world including the @entity17 now appear poised for a robust rebound			2
" there have been a dozen significant sales in the past quarter ... enough of our customers think it 's unlikely to get much worse			0
" but whiles sales have picked up , @entity74 predicted it could take years for sale prices to reach the premiums of only a few years ago : " since early summer [ business ] has picked up significantly ... we are back on par with 2007 , albeit at reduced values , " he said			0
manufacturers across the @entity17 share @entity104 's optimism , according to the survey			2
ninety - five percent of @entity17 companies questioned rated their prospects for the year ahead either " good or excellent " ( 56 percent ) or " ok " ( 39 percent )			1
at @entity109 " things are looking better for the last three months , " @entity108 told @entity2			0
" we 've had more sales in the past three months than in the previous 12 months , " he wrote in an email			0
at @entity15 , directors have changed their business strategy to accommodate the anticipated growth			0
" we 've increased our investment in infrastructure for large yachts , " said @entity116			0
" improving facilities and looking to recruit more people to work on boats up to 70 or 80 meters			0
" one of the reasons cited for the strength in @entity17 's superyacht business compared with manufacturers in other @entity128 countries has been the declining value of @entity130 against the @entity131			2
@entity132 , editor - in - chief of @entity134 magazine said that the exchange rate helped , but the high quality of @entity17 boats and sustained demand among the world 's wealthiest had helped hold up sales			1
@entity132 also explained that one of the effects of the recession has been to shift demand from new builds to the used boat brokerage and chartering markets			0
" there are signs that things are picking up ... @entity87 is the premiere big yacht show and it 's the real acid test of whether [ the rebound ] is the odd sale being picked up at a good price , or if the market has reignited properly , " explained @entity150 , @entity151 @entity17			1
if interest in the @entity7 is any indicator , then sales can be expected to meet bullish expectations			1
the annual end - of - summer yachting industry and yacht owners ' conference is fully booked this week			1
the number of double - decker pavilions has doubled since last year , but in spite of the event 's increased provision of these more expensive , higher visibility exhibition spaces supply still fell short of demand			2
in the @entity173 yacht manufacturers also say they 've seen a recent surge in interest in new construction of yachts over 150 feet			2
" over the last 45 days , all of a sudden , the inquires have started coming along really strong			0
that bodes well for the @entity7 , " said @entity180 , @entity181			2
" it 's fair to say sales came to a shuddering halt after the @entity87 show last year			0
" in another sign that interest in the top - end of the yacht market is back , @entity188 retailer @entity187 recently announced plans to team up with @entity193 , the @entity87 superyacht company , to build a $ 145 million ( € 100 million ) yacht			1
sales to @entity45 , the @entity46 and other developing countries have rebounded more quickly than sales to @entity128 and the @entity173 , according to @entity180 , as uncertainty about the markets has subsided and boosted consumer confidence			0
in the past six months , @entity202 had only had one inquiry from an @entity173 , which came in the last few weeks			0
@entity202 , the largest @entity173 retailer of megayachts , has had two projects out of 17 builds stall due to the recession , both about 164 feet long			0
@entity180 said the owners can either come back and pay for them to finish the work or let @entity202 sell them			0
throughout the downturn @entity202 was able to continue to deliver ships at a record pace , thanks to a hearty backlog of orders placed during the markets peaks .			0
