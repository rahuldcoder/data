-- how does a survivor of sexual abuse respond to students rioting at @entity4 ? " you 're not getting it			1
you just do n't get it , " said @entity7 who was abused by a priest as a teen			1
" it 's just stupid youthfulness			2
" earlier this week , legendary head football coach @entity14 was removed in the midst of a scandal involving sexual abuse allegations against a former defensive coordinator , @entity18			1
what started as an apparent celebration of @entity14 turned into a riot in the @entity23 town of @entity24			2
the crowd tipped over a news van and decried the media in anger wednesday night			1
they held signs in support of " @entity14 " -- a nickname for @entity14			2
some said their frustration stemmed from the media 's focus on @entity14 , rather than the charges against @entity18			2
watching footage of @entity4 students rioting in the streets wednesday night , @entity40 shuddered , then hung his head			1
what bothered @entity7 is that students " rallied around ( @entity14 's ) house , cheering him up			1
" " the kids up there just do n't understand what this does , " he said			1
" stop thinking of the adult and start thinking of what happens to a child that goes through this			0
you love the adult , you may not know the kid			0
start thinking of the kid and the horror they go through , because it 's hell			0
" @entity14 has been under scrutiny because of his response to allegations brought to him in 2002 by a graduate assistant			0
the assistant allegedly said he witnessed @entity18 , now 67 , having sex with a young boy in a shower at the campus football complex , according to a grand jury indictment			0
@entity14 reported the allegations to his boss and @entity23 's attorney general said it appeared @entity14 had met his obligations under state law			0
but critics said the coach should have reported the suspected abuse to police			1
@entity18 is accused of sexual offenses , child endangerment and " corruption of a minor " involving eight boys			1
many within the @entity4 community condemned the crowd 's actions			1
in the campus newspaper @entity89 , an editorial read : " wednesday night was an embarrassment for @entity4 ... the way students reacted set our university two steps back			1
" @entity4 grapples with conflict over coach 's firing , horrific allegations earlier this week , as questions about the coach 's action mounted , students began swarming @entity14 's home			1
the gatherings had the tone of a pep rally			0
@entity108 , a 22 - year - old college student who was sexually abused as a child , said the open support for @entity14 was disrespectful to survivors			1
" that 's the first thing people look at -- that their football team is without their head coach that 's been there so many years			0
nobody looks at the eight children			0
" the rioters are " never going to be in those children 's shoes			0
it 's not about football			0
it 's about eight children who are never going to get back their lives back			0
they 're going to live with this the rest of their lives			1
they might not get over that			0
" this kind of spectacle could even make abused kids more reluctant to go to the police , she said			0
the @entity4 scandal prompted numerous calls from sexual abuse survivors , said @entity140 , the outreach director at @entity141			1
" i have talked to people all over the country who have dealt with their abuse , " she said			1
" this is bringing it all back			0
" the reaction of the crowd could send an unintended message to children and teenagers who 've been abused : they may feel blamed for what happened to the football team and the rioting , said @entity140 , who was also abused as a child			2
it 's a " horrible statement that a winning football team is more important than the safety of the children			0
it mirrors what happened in the ( @entity168 ) church			0
" @entity169 : @entity4 tragedy shows danger of making coaches false idols @entity174 , a @entity4 alum who graduated in 1999 , watched the news unfold and felt he had to do something			1

he started a campaign to shift the attention to supporting victims of child abuse , by raising money for @entity187 , which stands for @entity187			2
in addition , some @entity4 students are planning to dress in blue for their next football game to support the victims of child abuse worldwide			1
@entity192 , the director of the @entity187 said the news story is bringing awareness and facilitating a national discussion about abuse , a topic often cloaked in secrecy			2
