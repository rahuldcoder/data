@entity7 driver @entity1 has been unrivaled over the last two years , winning 16 races since the start of 2010 to become the sport 's youngest two - time drivers ' champion			1

@entity23 eyes glory as @entity24 unveil radical new design " we had a great year , " @entity1 told the sport 's official website			1
" i think we 'll always look back to 2011 and think how special it was			2
" we know how special it was and we really enjoyed that but we know how hard it is to be that consistent , always there and nearly every race on the podium			0
" so the target is to obviously try to do it again and try to get everything out of ourselves , so we 'll see how we get on with the new car , the @entity19			1
" despite the success of the @entity42 - owned , @entity41 - based team -- who entered the elite division of motorsport as recently as 2005 -- @entity1 warned against complacency ahead of the new season , which starts in @entity48 on march 18			1
" at the beginning of last year we did n't really expect whatever happened last year , so i think it 's the same thing again			2
" it would be wrong to go into this season and expect 2011 to happen again ... i think it will be very , very tight this year and anything else would be a surprise to be honest			2
" new car gives @entity58 confidence to end @entity2 dominance @entity1 's @entity48 teammate @entity61 endured a frustrating 2011 , securing his first and only win of the year at the season - ending @entity64 @entity63 on his way to a third - place finish in the drivers ' standings -- 134 points behind @entity1			1
" last year was n't an amazing season , but it was n't too bad for me , " the 35 - year - old said			2
" i still managed to finish third in the drivers ' championship ... so it was a great way for me to finish the year with the victory in @entity64 and many strong results			0
" we 're always learning as athletes and i 'm looking forward to 2012 , it 's got some great opportunities for me			0
you know the old cliche , take each race as it comes , but that 's how it will be initially and we 'll go from there			0
" another veteran on the grid next year will be @entity91 's @entity90 , the 2007 world champion , who is returning to the sport after a two - season absence			1
the former @entity24 driver has joined @entity95 -- who competed in last year 's championship as @entity98 -- and spoke of his excitement at the launch of the team 's new @entity102 car			1
" @entity3 is something very special in my racing career , " said the 32 - year - old , who participated in @entity105 and the @entity106 in his break from @entity3			1
" you always want to race at the toughest level , so @entity3 is where you want to race if you have a choice			2
" i think we 'll have a lot of fun in the season ahead and hopefully we will get some good results			0
i want a strong enough car to challenge for good results			0
" @entity122 team @entity121 also showcased their new car on monday , with @entity125 driver @entity124 and @entity127 's @entity126 on hand to take the @entity129 for a spin			2
@entity124 finished last season in 12th place , four positions and 16 points ahead of @entity126 , and he is looking forward to his third year with the team			0
" we 've been through a lot together and can benefit from our shared experiences , " @entity124 said			0
" in my first year with the team we had a bad start but a good second half to the season			0
