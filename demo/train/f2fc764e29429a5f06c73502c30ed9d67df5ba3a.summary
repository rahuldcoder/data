@entity0 , @entity1 -- as the rallies for @entity4 grow , as the media coverage surrounding the tragedy deepens and as the calls for justice get louder , we all must remember one thing : revenge and justice are not the same thing			1
the $ 10,000 bounty issued by the @entity15 for the capture of @entity4 's shooter , @entity18 , might feel justified given what we know of the shooting death			1
but it is not a call for justice			1
it is a call for revenge			1
when the group 's leader , @entity27 , calls for " @entity29 , a tooth for a tooth , " it is a call for revenge			1
@entity27 's words at a rally -- " if the government wo n't do the job , we 'll do it " -- might feel empowering , might feel good			2
but that sentiment flies in the face of every call for justice that was made as well at that rally			1
anyone who is considering taking @entity27 up on his offer , or even embarking on a solitary journey of revenge should , to quote the @entity49 philosopher @entity48 , " dig two graves			2
" Â nothing good can come from a bunch of vigilantes hunting down and possibly harming another vigilante , regardless of how noble the motivation for doing so may appear on the surface			0
as angry as i am , and as many of you are , what @entity27 is proposing can only make a bad situation worse			0
he needs to retract the bounty proposal immediately			2
enough violence , and images of violence , surround this tragedy already			1
a " war " on stereotypes			1
the " fight " against racism			1
it feels as if we ca n't even discuss the issue of race as it relates to the @entity4 case without using words that are linked to violence			1
nothing about the word " war " connotes healing			2
very little about a bounty suggests togetherness			2
i 'm not just splitting hairs over semantics			0
it is science that suggests the words we use shape the way we think			0
and what we think is the precursor to what we do			0
if we continue to allow words of conflict to define the conversation about race and racial profiling , then i fear we will move on from this tragedy having learned absolutely nothing , like so many times before			2
i know many people think of @entity4 as a modern - day @entity102 , the 14 - year - old black kid from @entity104 who was kidnapped and killed by a pair of racist white men in @entity107 in 1955			1
i tend to see @entity4 as the new @entity108 , the young man who was diagnosed with @entity109 in 1984 at the age of 13			1
before @entity108 's story , the disease was in the public 's peripheral vision , truly discussed only by people who experienced its impact			2
but once a young , innocent face became associated with @entity109 , the country 's attitude changed and we began addressing it more effectively			2
Â opinion : @entity4 's killing and @entity125 's tragic past similarly , racial profiling was something only those directly affected would talk about			1
but the @entity4 tragedy has the potential to change that -- if we let it			1
earlier this week , @entity133 and i were guests of @entity136 's on @entity2 and quickly found ourselves in a heated discussion about whether it was appropriate for president @entity138 to comment on the tragedy			1
over the next eight minutes , we fought and argued over issues of race and racial profiling			0
we continued the conversation once the tv segment was over			0
we talked on the way to the @entity2 makeup room			0
we talked as we left the building , crossed the street and had a beer			0
my point is , we talked -- not in an effort to fight but to understand each other			0
we 're hardly the perfect example of race relations			0
in fact , both of us are constantly told via @entity158 , @entity159 and other social media just how racist we are			0
but we try to take each criticism with a grain of salt , understanding that at the end of the day , we 're just a couple of men , a couple of fathers who want the same thing : a better world for our kids			0
and i tend to believe we 're not the only ones			0
but we do n't get to that place through revenge , because revenge is cyclical and gets us nowhere			0
no , we get to that better world for our kids by walking the long linear line of justice , side by side , picking each other up when one falls , reaching a hand back when one gets tired , never forgetting that no matter how divergent our opinions might be from time to time , we 're in this thing together			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

new @entity15 's bounty to capture @entity4 's shooter is call for revenge
@entity191 : @entity192 should be withdrawn : revenge is not justice ; violence solves nothing
we use violent terms to discuss the tragedy , he says : war on stereotypes , fight against racism
@entity191 says revenge leads to more revenge , but justice will help build a better world
