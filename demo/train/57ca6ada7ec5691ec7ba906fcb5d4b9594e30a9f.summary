-- the discovery of a " sophisticated " tunnel between a @entity4 eat - in kitchen and two @entity6 warehouses led authorities on both sides of the @entity10 - @entity4 border to arrest at least nine suspects and seize between 20 and 30 tons of marijuana			1
the @entity14 find followed an eight - month investigation and came about three weeks after authorities discovered a similar drug tunnel in another warehouse in the @entity20 area of @entity21			1
between the two incidents , agents in the @entity10 and @entity4 seized roughly the equivalent of one marijuana cigarette for each of @entity6 's nearly 37 million residents , @entity23 special agent @entity22 said friday			1
" this is obviously not a @entity34 operation , " @entity30 , a @entity21 - based agent with @entity31 , said friday			2
" this is a major , significant drug cartel working			0
" @entity30 described the nearly half - mile - long and , in spots , 90 - foot - deep passageway as " very sophisticated , " even more so than the one found earlier this month			1
its southern entry was in the kitchen of a stucco @entity42 , @entity4 , home , which had a garage attached big enough for tractor - trailer trucks			1
after removing a 2 - foot by 4 - foot piece of flooring in that house , smugglers could head 80 feet down a cinder - block - lined stretch into the tunnel			0
the passageway had lighting , ventilation , wood and cinder - block supports , wood floors and rail carts , @entity10 law enforcement agents said			1
the tunnel split to lead into two separate warehouses in @entity21			2
" having been in several of these tunnels , this is one of the most sophisticated ... i 've ever seen , " @entity22 said			0
" this is a tunnel where a lot of drugs were being pushed through			0
" the discovery came after @entity68 agents , on thursday morning , spotted a tractor - trailer arriving at one of the warehouses , said @entity30			2
after getting its load , the truck headed to a border patrol checkpoint in @entity75 , @entity6 , about 60 miles north of @entity21			0
there , authorities who had been tracking the shipment found the truck filled " top to bottom , front to back " with 27,000 600 - pound packages of marijuana , @entity30 said			2
authorities initially could not get through the tunnel from the @entity6 side because it was blocked by huge packages of marijuana			0
much of the drug was in a 10 - by 20 - foot room about 60 feet below the surface			0
@entity10 agents and @entity4 military personnel formed a human chain to lug out what amounted to 3 to 4 tons of marijuana , according to @entity30			1
in addition , @entity10 law enforcement agencies tipped @entity4 authorities about a ranch on that side of the border , where 3 to 4 more tons of the drug was captured			1
@entity30 estimated that all the marijuana seized thursday could have sold wholesale for $ 17 million to $ 20 million or -- as @entity22 estimated -- been equal to 16 million to 17 million individual 1 - gram joints			0
the driver of the tractor - trailer truck was arrested and , if convicted on federal drug smuggling charges , could face between 10 years to life in prison , said assistant u.s. attorney @entity115			1
the driver of a box truck who accompanied the tractor - trailer to the @entity21 warehouse also was arrested , @entity30 said			2
although that truck did n't carry any drugs , the residence it went to had $ 13,500 in cash			0
both trucks ' drivers are @entity10 citizens and are now in federal custody			0
@entity4 authorities have arrested at least another seven people , @entity30 said			1
earlier this month , agents made several arrests after seizing about 30 tons of marijuana related to the other @entity21 tunnel discovery			1
@entity135 , the head of the @entity10 immigration and customs agency , said authorities " caught them in the act			2
" and in october , @entity4 authorities seized 105 tons of marijuana in @entity42			1
law enforcement agents on both sides of the border have found at least 75 cross-border tunnels in the past four years , most of them in @entity6 and @entity146 , according to @entity30			0
" @entity149 drug traffickers are using transborder tunnels to import tons of marijuana into the @entity10 , " @entity147 said			0
" clearly , these transborder tunnels pose a significant threat to our national security as well			0
