@entity0 knows what he is about to say will sound a little crazy to most people			0
when asked what the minimum legal drinking age should be in the @entity6 , @entity0 says 8 , or maybe even 6			1
no , the @entity8 anthropology professor is not advocating getting kids drunk			0
instead he favors a cultural model , common in countries like @entity12 or @entity13 , where parents serve small amounts of wine to their children at family meals			0
by doing this , he says , parents educate their kids about alcohol and rob drinking of its taboo allure , which can make rebellious teenagers sneak off to basements and backwoods to binge drink far from adult supervision			1
" in general , the younger people start to drink the safer they are , " said @entity0 , who has written several books and hundreds of scholarly articles on cultural attitudes towards alcohol			2
when introduced early , he said , " alcohol has no mystique			2
it 's no big deal			0
by contrast , where it 's banned until age 21 , there 's something of the ' forbidden fruit ' syndrome			1
" of course , @entity0 's idea has no chance of becoming law anytime soon			0
thirty years ago this week , @entity48 passed a bill that effectively raised the national drinking age to 21			1
despite subsequent efforts to lower it in some states -- and the fact that most developed countries allow young people to legally drink at 18 -- that threshold has remained firmly in place ever since			0
proponents of the higher drinking age says it reduces traffic fatalities and alcohol - related accidents while keeping booze out of the hands of teens , whose brains are still developing			1
but as the @entity6 marks thursday 's anniversary of the @entity69 , @entity0 and some other scholars still dare to ask an unpopular question : would @entity6 be better served by reducing its drinking age -- or at least encouraging states to set their own limits ? the @entity75 cites the @entity6 as one of only a handful of developed countries -- @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 are others -- with a minimum drinking age over 18			1
several countries , including @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , even allow 16 - year - olds to buy beer and wine			2
" i think 18 is viewed ( by most countries ) pretty much as a reasonable age limit , " said @entity92 , deputy president of the @entity93 or @entity93			2
" @entity97 ethic has really shaped the way alcohol is regulated in the @entity6 , " @entity92 said			2
" alcohol is seen more as a drug , and not something that 's integrated into everyday life			2
" @entity103 about underage drinking two generations of younger @entity6 have never known anything but needing to be 21 -- or owning an @entity107 that says you are -- to buy a six - pack or drink in a bar			1
but in the wide - lapeled 1970s , things were very different			2
after @entity48 in 1971 dropped the voting age from 21 to 18 , many states followed suit by lowering decades - old barriers to drinking			1
the rationale went something like this : if young @entity6 could be entrusted to vote , serve on a jury and fight in @entity120 , why could n't they order a beer ? by the late 1970s , more than half the states in the @entity6 had lowered their minimum drinking ages , usually from 21 to 18			1
but when research showed an increase in traffic fatalities in these states , state legislatures began to reverse course			0
@entity103 , founded in 1980 , quickly gained national clout and lobbied lawmakers to raise the legal limit			0
on july 17 , 1984 , @entity48 passed a law that withheld federal highway funding from every state that continued to allow people under 21 to buy alcohol -- effectively forcing them to raise their drinking ages			1
by 1995 , faced with this strong financial incentive and pressure from @entity103 , all 50 states and the @entity141 had complied			0
is alcohol and the teen brain a bad mix ? many studies have since attempted to gauge the law 's impact on public health			0
one found that among young drivers ( ages 16 - 20 ) killed in car wrecks , the percentage with positive blood - alcohol levels declined from 61 % in 1982 to 31 % in 1995 -- a bigger decline than for older age groups			2
" minimum legal drinking age laws have proven to be a very effective and important countermeasure for reducing drunk driving when younger drivers are involved , " said the @entity157 in a statement			1
the @entity157 estimates that raising the national legal drinking age from 18 to 21 has saved more than 500 lives each year			1
" research shows that it saves lives , " agreed @entity166 president @entity165			0
" in fact , it is one of the most researched public health laws on the books			0
when the law was raised to 21 , alcohol - related deaths for young people decreased ; when the drinking age was lowered , deaths increased			1
" a recent study in @entity180 , which lowered its drinking age in 1999 from 20 to 18 , found that drivers aged 18 or 19 now face a higher risk of being involved in alcohol - related crashes that cause death or injury			1
the 21 - year - old limit may be less effective at curbing binge drinking on college campuses , however			1
a @entity191 study of students at 56 colleges found that in the immediate aftermath of 21 becoming the national drinking age , significantly more underage students drank compared to those of legal age			1
a stalled movement there 's a movement to lower legal drinking ages in the @entity6 , and its leader is not a college student or a brewery owner			2
he 's a university president			0
weary of battling drinking on campus during his tenure as president of @entity212 , @entity206 penned a column in the @entity214 assailing the 21 - year - old drinking age as " bad social policy and terrible law			1
" " right now we 're in an impossible position ( on college campuses )			0
why should we be expected to enforce a law that 's ignored by 70 percent of students before they even come ( to college ) ? " @entity206 , now president of the @entity225 in @entity226 , @entity227 , told @entity1 this week			0
" it 's taking place behind closed doors , where it 's much more dangerous			0
it 's unsupervised , " he said			0
" it 's out of step with social reality			0
" @entity236 : get real , lower drinking age to 19 instead , he argues , colleges should be given the chance to educate students on how to drink responsibly , within campus boundaries and out in the open			1
in 2008 @entity206 recruited more than 130 college presidents to sign the @entity245 , which pushed for a new federal transportation bill that would n't penalize states for setting drinking ages under 21			2
he said he and other college presidents were set to testify before @entity48 that fall when the economy tanked and legislators ' priorities turned elsewhere			0
" we missed our moment , " he said			0
lawmakers in a handful of states have proposed lowering the drinking age from 21 to 18 , but none have gained traction so far			1
experts say lowering the drinking age remains a tough sell to politicians worried about re-election			1
a 2007 @entity267 poll found that 77 % of @entity6 opposed lowering the drinking age in all states to 18			1
" there is n't much appetite to change something that appears to be working , " said @entity92 of @entity93			0
" it 's not a very popular issue and it could potentially be damaging to a politician to advocate for a lower age , because nobody wants more traffic accidents			2
it 's pretty much a no go			0
" but @entity206 is not giving up			0
he believes legal limits for drinking should be set by the states , not the federal government			0
and he proposes that @entity6 teens be eligible for an alcohol permit -- not unlike a driver 's license -- upon turning 18 , graduating from high school and completing an alcohol - education course			1
they would need the permit to buy beer , wine or liquor , and the state could revoke the permit for those convicted of alcohol - related offenses such as drunk driving .			1

thursday is 30th anniversary of bill that effectively raised @entity6 drinking age to 21
proponents say higher drinking age reduces alcohol - related accidents
*opponents* say it creates a " forbidden fruit " syndrome that leads to binge drinking
