-- the results of the @entity2 into the 1972 @entity4 massacre in @entity5 were unveiled tuesday			1
here are some questions and answers about the inquiry , which is one of the longest in @entity11 legal history			1
what is @entity4 ? on sunday , january 30 , 1972 , a large crowd took part in a banned civil rights march in the @entity5 city of @entity17			1
( even the name of the city is disputed , with @entity21 nationalists calling it @entity17 and @entity24 unionists calling it @entity17			0
) after a disturbance , @entity27 paratroopers fired shots into the crowd , killing a total of 14 people			0
" @entity4 , " as it came to be known , was a major turning point in @entity5 's history and considered by many to be one of the greatest injustices of the @entity37			1
why is there so much controversy surrounding @entity4 ? there was already simmering anger and distrust in @entity17 when the soldiers opened fire , and @entity4 only served to increase the @entity46 sentiment in the city			0
the soldiers said shots were fired before they shot at the crowd			0
an inquiry shortly after the shootings largely cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing and alleged some of the dead and wounded were gunmen or bombers			1
however , former prime minister @entity58 said in 1998 there is no proof that the victims were handling any weapons or bombs			0
the shootings led to international condemnation and , according to analysts , hardened @entity46 sentiments in @entity5 and led to many fresh recruits to the @entity69			1
the semi-autonomous @entity5 government was suspended weeks later , which was followed by decades of rule from @entity72			2
this happened in 1972 , so why has n't there been an inquiry before now ? there was an inquiry that same year , and the report came out 11 weeks after @entity4			2
but because it happened so soon after the incident , the inquiry was not able to take all the evidence that was later available , including evidence from people who were still in hospitals			2
lord chief justice @entity85 , who led the 1972 inquiry , also did not consider substantial numbers of eyewitness accounts provided to his inquiry , former prime minister @entity58 said when he launched the current inquiry in 1998			2
new material including new eyewitness accounts , new interpretation of ballistic material , and new medical evidence , has also come to light since 1972 , @entity58 said			0
@entity58 ordered the inquiry to boost the struggling @entity5 peace process following a clamor by the victims ' relatives , but @entity104 political leaders and senior officers in the @entity106 -- whose soldiers fired the fatal shots -- condemned the inquiry			1
it was , however , instrumental in bringing about the landmark @entity111 agreement , signed later that year , that led to relative peace in the process after 30 years of violence in which almost 3,000 people died			1
when did the current inquiry begin ? the current inquiry began in 1998 after @entity58 decided there was enough new evidence to merit a fresh investigation			0
the families of those killed had presented a new dossier on @entity4 to the @entity11 government the year before , in 1997 , and the @entity5 government had also sent a detailed analysis of the new evidence and of @entity130 's findings in light of the new material			1
who led the inquiry ? @entity135 , a member of the @entity11 @entity136 , chaired the inquiry			1
the other members were @entity140 judge @entity139 and @entity142 judge @entity141			0
@entity144 report on @entity4 why has it taken 12 years for the inquiry to finish ? the inquiry investigated a massive amount of evidence and testimony			2
inquiry members interviewed and received statements from around 2,500 people and heard testimony from 922 of them			1
the first witness testified in november 2000 and the last testified in january 2005			0
the inquiry looked at a total of 160 volumes of evidence , including 13 volumes of photographs , 121 audiotapes and 110 videotapes			1
the inquiry has been criticized for taking so long and also for costing so much -- a total of Â£ 190 million ( $ 280.3 million ) as of february 2010			1
will anyone be prosecuted after the report comes out ? the inquiry was not a trial ; it only sought the truth about what happened on @entity4			0
its task was not to decide in favor of one side or the other , according to the inquiry			0
witnesses who testified may be open to prosecution later , although any evidence they gave to the inquiry -- whether oral or written -- may not be used against them if they are prosecuted , the inquiry says			2
what effect might the report have ? victims ' relatives will be pleased the report cleared the dead of blame , declared the killings unlawful , and will hope it leads to prosecutions of soldiers			0
but the report is also likely to test relations between @entity24 unionists and nationalists , who now share power in @entity5			0
@entity0 's @entity197 and @entity198 in @entity72 , @entity199 , contributed to this report .			0

longest - running inquiry in @entity11 history looked into 1972 @entity5 killings
13 people killed on the spot by @entity11 soldiers , while 1 died later
@entity209 heard from thousands of witnesses over a dozen years , costing $ 280 million
@entity212 could *reopen* old wounds
