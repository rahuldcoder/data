from @entity1 , to @entity2 , to @entity3 , a new social media application is causing problems on middle school and high school campuses across the @entity7			1
it 's called @entity9 , a location - based app that creates an anonymous social chat room where up to 500 nearby users connect through gps tracking on their phones			1
less than 4 months old , @entity9 has " a couple hundred thousand users , mainly in @entity21 / @entity20 campuses , " its co-founder @entity16 said			1
users are limited to 200 characters , and no pictures are allowed			2
if a post is " down voted " enough times by other users on the forum , the comment disappears			0
tech experts are comparing the new @entity32 - based app to a cross between @entity34 and @entity35			0
" the app was made for college - age users or above , for college campuses and to act as a virtual bulletin board , so it acts as local @entity35 for their campus , " @entity36 told @entity37			1
although the app is meant for users age 17 and older , younger users can still sign up , and that 's where the issues have sprouted			1
school administrators in @entity1 said teens in some of their schools have used the free app for cyberbullying			1
others have made anonymous bomb threats that have led to school lockdowns			1
" students were actually coming downstairs to talk to administration , and they were mentioning remarks posted and student names that were obvious , so of course that is going to impact you , " @entity57 , assistant vice principal at @entity58 , told @entity37 affiliate @entity59			0
some students have compared it to a virtual bathroom wall where users post vitriol and hate			2
" they ripped on someone for getting raped , and that 's just so wrong			0
they said a whole lot of bad things about this girl , " @entity58 student @entity76 told @entity59			0
in southern @entity3 , a @entity81 resource officer told @entity37 a threatening @entity9 post caused a bomb scare on campus			1
" the school was placed on lockdown , we conducted a sweep utilizing our bomb squad and bomb - sniffing dogs and nothing suspicious was located on or near the campus , " @entity86 's spokesman @entity85 told @entity37			1
he added that the app is so new that some students had n't even heard about it yet			2
in @entity2 , the principal of @entity99 in @entity100 wrote a cautionary letter to parents warning them about the " inflammatory [ @entity9 ] app , " encouraging them to talk to their children about the " dangers of social media			1
" the school district has blocked the app from its network , but principal @entity111 writes , students have found ways around that too			1
" if used inappropriately , @entity9 posts can be especially vicious and hurtful , since there is no way to trace their source , and can be disseminated widely , " @entity111 said in the letter			2
these types of incidents have caused the app 's developers to disable it in some areas			1
@entity36 told @entity37 he does n't want high school students using the app. " one of the things we were planning to do is to essentially geo - sense every high school and middle school in @entity7 , so if they try to open the app in their school , it will say something like ' no , no no , looks like you are trying to open the app on a high school or middle school and this is only for college kids , ' and it will disable it and the app wo n't work , " @entity36 told @entity37			1
" that will completely eliminate the problem we have been seeing , so we geo - sensed the entire city of @entity1 until we get this fix up			2
we are working on getting third - party help to get the fix in place as soon as possible			0
" but cyberbullying expert @entity151 says that 's just a short - term solution			2
he says teens will figure out a way around it			0
" it is pretty impossible to limit it to the ages that the founders have intended , " said @entity151 , who is the co-director at the @entity157 at the @entity158			0
" when i signed up for the app , it said that you have to be 17 or above to sign in , and of course , there was n't any way of them checking my age so anybody could sign up			0
" the app 's developers defended their technology , saying it is used for good			1
" with anonymity comes a lot of responsibility , and college kids have the maturity that it takes to handle those responsibilities , " @entity36 said			0
" one of my favorite use case stories is a freshman missed his flight for @entity185 break , and he came back to campus and he posted on @entity9 that the freshman dorms were closed , and so an upperclassman let him crash on his couch , " @entity36 said			2
" @entity190 can be a really beautiful thing , and one of the reasons we made it anonymous is it gives people a blank slate to work from , so you 're not judged on your race or sexuality or gender			0
on @entity9 you are purely judged on content you create			2
he added , " the longer that we are around on college campuses , the better it gets			0
" as more applications pop up and the environments of social networking sites change , @entity151 says the emphasis should be on teaching younger generations about respect in online communities			0
" it is more important to talk to the students about how to treat each other respectfully			0
whether it is happening in an application like this or @entity221 or on e-mail , the emphasis for us has always been on those behaviors because it is easier to teach that than to restrict that to particular technology			0

@entity9 creates an anonymous chat room of users connected by location
meant for colleges students , high schoolers have caught on , caused trouble
@entity1 schools *report* cyberbullying , and a @entity3 school *report*s a bomb scare
the app is useful for more mature college students , app 's co-founder says
