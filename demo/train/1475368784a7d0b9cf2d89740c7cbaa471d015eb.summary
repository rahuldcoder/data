@entity0 , a fun - loving keyboardist who played on records by such artists as the @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and his own bands -- the @entity7 and its successor , the faces -- died wednesday , according to a statement from his record label , @entity11			1
the cause of death was complications from a stroke , according to @entity11			2
@entity16 , the @entity9 ' drummer who later joined the who , expressed his sadness in the statement			1
" i am completely devastated by this shocking news and i know this goes for @entity22 ( @entity22 ) and @entity23 ( @entity23 ) also			2
" the @entity26 's resume was varied and eclectic , his soulful and often joyous organ fills heard on such albums as the @entity3 ' " @entity28 , " @entity4 ' " @entity29 " and @entity31 's " @entity30			1
" a rousing live performer , he played with @entity33 and @entity5 and was scheduled to tour with @entity34 this winter			1
his death comes on the heels of that of another @entity3 sideman , saxophone player @entity38 , who died tuesday			1
@entity0 established his abilities while touring with the @entity7 and the @entity9			1
the latter band was particularly known for its good - time habits , like demolishing hotel rooms in classic rock ' n ' roll fashion			2
" you could n't go from one town to another and not walk into the identical room in every town , " he explained to @entity44 in a 2004 interview			0
" so we hurt them			0
" the @entity7 were heroes of @entity55 's youth and had a great deal of success there , though just one of their songs , 1967 's " @entity61 , " cracked the @entity62 in the @entity63			1
when lead singer @entity66 left the band in 1969 , the height - challenged group reformed around the much taller @entity23 and @entity22 and dropped the " @entity69 " from its name			0
the @entity9 ' hits included " @entity71 " and " @entity72			1
" @entity0 , known as " @entity0 , " was born in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , in 1945			1
he joined the @entity7 in 1965 and the band had a four - year run of hits , including " @entity79 , " " @entity80 " and " @entity81 , " the latter from their @entity55 no. 1 album , " @entity84			1
" the @entity85 were known for such albums as " a nod is as good as a @entity88 to a @entity89 " and " @entity90 , " but it was their marathon live performances that really made their reputation -- sometimes unfairly			2
" we had the reputation of big drinkers , but we paced ourselves , " @entity0 told @entity44			2
" we all knew our limits			0
... i 'm now fighting this reputation of being sloppy , but listen ( to the music )			0
" the band tried to juggle group dynamics with @entity23 's soaring solo career , but the writing was on the wall when the singer left in 1975			0
@entity22 joined the @entity3 and @entity0 became an in - demand session musician			1
@entity0 recorded a handful of albums on his own , including " @entity111 " ( 1979 ) , " @entity112 " ( 1980 ) and " @entity63 " ( 2014 ) , and in recent years led the @entity113 from his adopted hometown of @entity115 , @entity116			1
when he was n't in @entity115 he was on the road , a place where he was always happy			0
describing the travels of the @entity7 in the ' 60s -- when touring was pretty much a do - it - yourself affair -- he could n't help but wax fondly			2
" a favorite memory keeps coming back : it 's just us in the car , going to gigs , " he told the @entity123 in 2012			0
" we used to smoke , listen to music , laugh and giggle , and had the best time ! we 'd get to the gig and we 'd play music , then we 'd leave the gig and we 'd listen to music			0
then we 'd go back to the hotel and we 'd play music , then we 'd listen to music			0
it 's all we did , and it was fabulous ! you ca n't have a better life			0
" people we 've lost in 2014			0
