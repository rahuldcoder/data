@entity3 forces in @entity4 loyal to president @entity5 have fired at least four scud missiles inside @entity7 , presumably at rebel groups , a @entity1 official said wednesday			1
@entity1 military satellites picked up and confirmed the infrared signature of the four short - range scud missiles , which were launched from the @entity4 area into northern @entity7 , according to an official who declined to be named , citing the sensitivity of the matter			1
the missiles did not land on the @entity18 side of the border but " came close , " the official said			0
and as @entity3 forces dabble with longer - range weapons with increased lethality , authorities say @entity24 is also preparing to send a @entity26 missile defense system to neighboring @entity18 after it made the request at a meeting in @entity29 last week			2
within days , the @entity31 administration is expected to issue orders determining the number of @entity26 missile batteries and personnel to be sent , according to a @entity37 spokesman			0
earlier this month , a @entity1 official said the @entity3 government was " ratcheting things up , " noting that @entity3 forces had already fired some 20 rockets with the relatively long range of 60 miles			1
analysts say the @entity5 government maintains up to 400 of the short - and medium - range @entity46 - developed scud missiles , while @entity49 officials point to so - called barrel bombs -- incendiary explosives with flammable material similar to napalm -- that are now apparently being deployed by the @entity3 government			1
@entity24 issued a statement wednesday saying that the alliance had " detected the launch of a number of unguided , short - range ballistic missiles inside @entity7 this week , " and that the " trajectory and distance traveled indicate they were @entity63 - type missiles			1
" the move represents an escalation in the 20 - month civil war , which has threatened to destabilize the broader region and draw neighboring countries and militant groups into the conflict			0
" as the regime becomes more and more desperate , we see it resorting to increased lethality and more vicious weapons moving forward , " said @entity49 spokeswoman @entity71			0
" and we have in recent days seen missiles deployed			0
" amid the growing concern about missiles , @entity7 's newly formed opposition coalition won recognition from international supporters on wednesday in @entity82			1
the @entity7 , representing more than 100 countries and organizations , agreed wednesday to recognize the @entity85 of the @entity3 @entity86 and @entity87 as the legitimate representative of the @entity3 people			1
the designation immediately broadens international recognition for the coalition and should pave the way for additional support for the rebel cause , said @entity97 analyst @entity96 , who attended the session in @entity99 , @entity82			2
" what this recognition does , i think , is give the coalition more confidence in its workings , " @entity96 said			0
previously , several @entity106 and @entity107 states , including @entity108 and the @entity109 , had recognized the group			0
the @entity7 recognition , however , did little to soothe opposition leaders stung by @entity1 president @entity31 's decision tuesday to list one rebel group as a terrorist organization			1
opposition leader @entity116 urged the @entity1 to rescind its decision to list the @entity119 organization as a terrorist group and impose sanctions on its leaders , saying the coalition rejects radical violence			1
@entity119 is not part of the coalition but has fought against @entity7 's government and , consequently , has support among @entity3 sympathetic to the rebellion , @entity96 said			1

at the @entity82 meeting , @entity134 told @entity3 rebel leaders that their newfound recognition is freighted with the weight of international expectations			2

@entity173 also pledged $ 100 million in aid , @entity96 said			0

he said an agreement he had worked out in @entity180 , @entity181 , with @entity1 secretary of state @entity182 laid out a path for a negotiated transfer of power , but he said the new coalition 's goals call for it to " overturn the regime , dismantle government institutions and refuse dialogue with the @entity3 government			2
" " we inquired with our @entity1 partners as to how that conforms with the logic of the @entity180 communique , and they told us that the most important thing is to unite the opposition , and its platform can , quote , ' be corrected , ' " @entity178 said			2
as the diplomatic talks were going on in @entity82 , violence continued in @entity7			0
