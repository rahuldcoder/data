the 62 - year - old retired rear admiral , who earned two @entity8 awards and spent a lifetime on the water and above it , did n't catch any fish , but he did return with some memorable souvenirs			2
twenty miles from shore and 80 feet under the @entity17 , parts of @entity15 's past were brought to the surface			0
nearly 38 years ago , the naval aviator made a critical decision that almost cost him his life and ultimately defined it			1
@entity1 and three other pilots were simulating bombing runs on a training mission when his @entity25 clipped the plane next to him			1
@entity1 ejected at a speed close to 350 mph			1
" it 's not one of those things you brag about , honestly , " laughed @entity1			1
" i did n't cover myself in glory on december 2 , 1974			0
so it 's one of those things if people asked i would tell them , but i did n't try to advertise it as such			0
" pilot who survived midair collision decades ago learns wreckage found the wreckage of @entity15 's plane was found last month by a team of divers from @entity43 ( think it sink it reef it ) , a @entity47 - based marine conservation company that specializes , among other things , in building artificial reefs			1
a data plate picked up off the ocean floor was traced back to @entity1 , who now teaches aviation maintenance technology in @entity53 , @entity54			1
@entity55 , executive director of @entity43 , asked @entity1 if he would like to return to the wreckage site , an invitation @entity1 eagerly accepted			1
just after dawn on a recent saturday morning , @entity1 joined a crew for a 90 - minute ride to the wreckage site			1
little did he know that the decades - old ruins had become part of a productive ecosystem			1
" the fact we could determine it was his aircraft and locate @entity1 and actually bring him out here to visit the reef his wreckage had created , it 's actually a very gratifying experience for us , " said @entity55 who had previously dived several times at the site now thriving with fish			1
sea bass , scorpion , trigger and octopus now call the broken metal structure home			0
see the underwater wreckage @entity55 has no immediate plans to retrieve the larger plane parts			1

" daughter searches for missing father the trip brings back memories for @entity1 , who was just 24 at the time of the accident			1
his misjudgment during a roll left brought his plane too close to an aircraft piloted by his squadron 's commanding officer			2
" it was the last thing he expected that morning , i 'm sure , that i would bump into him up there			0
" that plane made it safely back to base			2
@entity1 never saw his own aircraft go into the water because he was above the clouds when he ejected , and shortly afterward he was picked up by a training helicopter in the area			1
@entity1 , who went on to become commanding officer of the aircraft carrier @entity111 , spent 30 years in the @entity112			1
he used his flying miscalculation to develop a greater appreciation for errors made by others			0
he taught the next generation of cadets that mistakes are a part of life and what matters is what one does with second - chance opportunities			2
floating above the wreckage , he took advantage of his			2
white clouds , calm seas			0
on the first trip down to the bottom , divers retrieved a piece of armor plating			0
@entity1 studied it but was n't exactly sure what part of the plane it came from			1
" that 's a substantial piece of evidence , " he laughed			0
" maybe exhibit a in my case of my episode in bad airmanship			0
" much of the debris , now a mix of tires , turbine blades and unrecognizable airplane features , is encrusted with marine life such as coral and sponges			0
" you wished the day had turned out different , obviously , than it did , but it is what it is			0
i was fortunate that nobody else was hurt , " @entity1 said			2
" i 'm glad it happened out here if it had to happen , you know			0
" as the day ended and temperatures started cooling off , the blue skies now streaked with purple highlights , @entity15 , his wife @entity162 , @entity163 and a dozen other divers , friends and observers returned to shore			0
back on land , @entity1 was still beaming , " i 'll treasure whatever @entity55 ( @entity163 ) lets me have just as a keepsake of the event			2
it will certainly cause me to pause and remember that day and again to remember the incredible squadron mates i had and the people that entrusted me with that airplane			0
i may have broken that trust with the mishap , but they saw fit to trust me again , that 's what i 'll remember when i look at those ( pieces )			0
