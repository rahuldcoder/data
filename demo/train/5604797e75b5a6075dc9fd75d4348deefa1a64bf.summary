-- more than just the quintessential @entity3 shopping experience , @entity1 is a tourist attraction in its own right			1
this historic farmers market is the place to pick up all manner of fresh local produce , as well as handmade crafts , jewelry , antiques and paintings			1
keep your camera handy to snap the colorful floral displays and the fishmongers tossing whole salmon to each other			0
if @entity1 whets your appetite for fresh produce , check out the @entity23 ( 5330 @entity24 , sundays ) for delicious farm - fresh goodies			1
another great sunday market is the weekly @entity28 ( 400 n 34th street ) , a cornucopia of used , vintage and antique goods			1
for the avid antiques hunter the underground @entity33 ( 602 @entity34 ) has more than 60 stalls			0
if you prefer big brand names you 'll want to head downtown , where you 'll find the likes of @entity39 ( 500 pike street ) and a colossal @entity40 ( 1500 6th avenue )			0
@entity41 is also home to @entity43 's ( 1601 @entity42 ) , still known to locals as " @entity45 " from its former incarnation as @entity47			1
@entity43 can be good for a bargain , but the city 's best department store is the flagship @entity51 ( 500 pine street ) , famed for it exemplary customer service			2
for something more cutting edge , @entity53 and @entity54 are full of funky boutiques and vintage clothing stores			1
@entity59 ( 325 @entity60 and 4300 @entity61 ) is a good option for second - hand threads , while sneaker freaks will find that @entity65 ( 615 @entity66 ) is a treasure trove of fancy footwear			0

bamboozle your friends by getting them an eccentric souvenir from @entity105 ( 2428 nw @entity106 )			2
of course , eccentric is a relative term , but squirrel underpants ( which , apparently , are also suitable for hamsters , frogs and gerbils ) and inflatable fruitcakes should qualify as eccentric by most standards			0
if you plan to visit this bazaar of the bizarre you should note that @entity115 's is set to move to the corner of @entity117 and @entity118 , in @entity119 , some time next year			2
