-- police say guilt was written all over their faces			1
police received a call friday night that two men with hooded sweatshirts and painted faces had tried to break into a man 's home in @entity11 , @entity12			1
when police stopped a vehicle matching the caller 's description blocks away , they were stunned by the men 's disguises			1
there were no ski masks or stockings pulled over their heads ; instead , @entity23 , 23 , and @entity24 , 20 , streaked their faces with permanent black marker			1
@entity26 told @entity0 the strange disguises made it easier for his officers			0
" we 're very skilled investigators and the black faces gave them right away , " @entity26 said jokingly			1
" i have to assume the officers were kind of laughing at the time			0
i 've never heard of coloring your face with a permanent marker			2
" @entity26 said police believe one of the alleged burglars targeted the home because he suspected his girlfriend had a relationship with the man who lived there			2
" they probably were just not thinking straight and figured we 'll go out and scare the guy or whatever , " @entity26 said			0
" [ they were ] being dumb and combine that with alcohol and it was the perfect storm			0
" both men were charged with attempted burglary , and @entity23 was charged additionally with operating a vehicle while intoxicated			1
lawyers for the two men could not be reached for comment			2
@entity26 said he 's been fielding calls about the case from news media outlets from all over the country -- mostly because of their funny - looking mug shots			0
" i 've been chief here almost 25 years , been with the department 28Â½ years and i 've seen a lot of things that make me laugh and weird things but this was probably the best combination of the two -- strangely weird and hilariously funny all at the same time			0
