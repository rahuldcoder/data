@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 secretary of state @entity3 said friday she did not come to @entity1 for " happy talk			1
" her three - day trip is aimed at getting frank , open discussions going about the fight against terrorism , and that includes presenting @entity4 concerns about how much success @entity1 is having , she said			1
in an interview with @entity2 , @entity13 said it 's time to " clear the air " with a key @entity4 ally			1
she added , " i do n't think the way you deal with negative feelings is to pretend they 're not there			1
" " i think it 's important , if we are going to have the kind of cooperative partnership , that i think is in the best interest of both of our countries , for me to express some of the questions that are on the minds of the @entity4 people , " @entity13 told @entity2 's @entity23			1
the secretary 's comments came a day after she seemed to question the commitment of some in the @entity1 government for going after the leaders of @entity40 , who @entity4 intelligence experts believe are taking refuge in @entity1 's remote tribal areas			1
" @entity40 has had safe haven in @entity1 since 2002 , " she told a group of @entity1 journalists thursday			1
" i find it hard to believe that nobody in your government knows where they are and could n't get them if they really wanted to			2
" she added , " maybe they 're not gettable			0
" in the @entity2 interview friday , @entity13 said she was not suggesting that someone inside the government might be complicit with @entity40 or might be failing to follow through in fighting the terrorist group			1
" no , no , " she said			0
" what i was responding to is what i have been really doing on this trip , which is there exists a trust deficit , certainly on the part of @entity1 toward the @entity4 , toward our intentions and our actions			1
and yet we have so much in common , we face a common threat			0
we certainly have a common enemy in extremism and terrorism , and so part of what i have been doing is answering every single charge , every question			2
" trust " is a two - way street , " she added			0
while @entity1 's military operation has been " extremely courageous in both @entity84 and now in @entity85 , success there is not sufficient , " she said			1
" ... i just want to keep putting on the table that we have some concerns as well			2
and i think ... that 's the kind of relationship i 'm looking to build here			0
" asked whether she had underestimated the level of anti-american sentiment in @entity1 , @entity13 said , " no , because i 've been following the research and the polling that 's gone on for a couple of years			1
i knew that we were inheriting a pretty negative situation that we were going to have to address			2
" that 's why she wanted three days in the country , " a long trip for a secretary of state , " she said			0
" i wanted to demonstrate that , look , we are not coming here claiming that everything we 've done is perfect			0
i 've admitted to mistakes by our country going back in time , but i 've also reminded people that we 've been partners and allies from the beginning of @entity1 's inception as a country			1
@entity1 has helped us on several important occasions , and we are very grateful for that			1
so let 's begin to clear the air here			0
" @entity13 also commented on @entity115 , as the @entity4 seeks clarification on whether the nation will agree to a deal brokered by the @entity119 aimed at resolving a dispute about @entity115 's nuclear program			1
" i am going to let the process play out , but clearly we are working to determine exactly what they are willing to do , " @entity13 said			0
the secretary made a vow to @entity128 and @entity129 leaders during the @entity2 interview as well			0
" we 're going to do everything we can to try to clear away whatever concerns that the parties have , to actually get them into negotiations where they then can thrash out all of these difficult issues , " she said			2
" i think i 'm pretty realistic about what has to be overcome for there to be the level of acceptance that is required to get into these negotiations , " she added			0
" but remember , prior to negotiations , people stake out all kinds of positions , and then in the caldron of actually getting down to specifics , that all begins to be worked out			0
" she referred to the experience of former president @entity13			0
" i watched in the ' 90s as my husband just kept pushing and pushing and pushing , and good things happened			0
there was n't a final agreement , but fewer people died , there were more opportunities for economic development , for trade , for exchanges			2
it had positive effects , even though it did n't cross the finish line			2
so i think that being involved at the highest levels sends a message of our seriousness of purpose			0
