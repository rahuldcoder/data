-- effective saturday night , @entity2 vice president @entity3 took over @entity5 's responsibilities as president , @entity2 government spokesman @entity1 told @entity0			1
the power transfer comes as a source close to the @entity10 government said that the long - time @entity2 ruler arrived in @entity12 around midnight saturday , a day after being hurt in an attack on a mosque in his palace			1
some @entity2 officials continue to insist that @entity5 , who for months has resisted calls to step down , is still in @entity2			2
@entity19 , @entity20 's deputy mayor , told @entity2 state tv saturday night that " @entity5 is still being treated in the military hospital in @entity20			1
" yet the @entity10 source said that @entity5 was immediately taken to a nearby hospital after his plane landed in @entity10			2
a senior @entity2 government official had told @entity0 that @entity5 was fine after sustaining a slight head injury in friday 's attack , and he gave a nationally broadcast speech later that night			1
but @entity5 's medical condition is worse than originally thought , according to the @entity10 source			1
in response to that attack , @entity2 security forces on friday pounded the home of @entity35 , the tribal leader whose supporters are suspected of being behind the presidential palace offensive			1
the flurry of shelling left 10 people dead and 35 others wounded , according to @entity42 , an official with @entity43 , a @entity45 tribal confederation led by @entity35			0
the @entity10 government source said saturday that the @entity12 government has helped to broker an open - ended cease - fire aimed at ending spiralling violence in @entity2			1
demonstrators have demanded @entity5 's ouster for months , and fighting between @entity2 government forces and @entity54 has spiked considerably in recent weeks			1
key members of all pertinent parties agreed to the deal , with the signatories including @entity59			0
gen. @entity60 , who defected to the opposition ; @entity35 , the @entity64 and @entity43 leader ; and @entity5 's sons , representing the government			1
the @entity10 source said that @entity66 and crown prince sultan bin @entity67 have been heavily involved in setting up the framework for the cease - fire			0
this is not the first time that the opposition and @entity5 , who has led @entity2 for 33 years , have seemingly agreed to a peace deal			1
the @entity75 , which consists of representatives from six neighboring nations , helped broker a pact that involved @entity5 stepping down from power -- but that agreement ended up breaking down weeks ago			2
meanwhile , the popular unrest in the impoverished @entity83 nation continued saturday			0
tens of thousands of demonstrators congregated saturday in @entity20 's @entity86			2
meanwhile , in the flashpoint town of @entity89 , protesters retook an iconic square in the city 's center saturday after government forces cleared it out last week			0
eyewitnesses said security forces tried to disperse crowds of anti-government demonstrators by shooting at them and that at least two were injured			0
@entity2 's tough crackdown against peaceful protesters in @entity89 prompted a new denunciation by @entity102 , an international organization that monitors human rights violations			2
" first the security forces kill and wound protesters , then they keep medical workers from treating the wounded and raze the protesters ' camps to wipe out all traces of them , " said @entity104 , deputy @entity105 director at @entity102			0
" foreign countries need to respond			0
they should freeze the assets of the president and other top officials until these horrendous abuses stop and those responsible are brought to account , " said @entity104 , whose group also called for the export bans on arms and security equipment to @entity2			2
friday 's presidential palace attack illustrates the escalating violence			1
a @entity2 official who asked not to be named told @entity0 that @entity5 was in the mosque when two " projectiles " were fired during friday prayers			1
he confirmed the death of @entity132 and four bodyguards			0
state - run news agency @entity136 , citing a source in @entity5 's office , said three guards and the sheikh were killed			1
others taken to @entity10 for treatment include prime minister @entity141 ; deputy prime ministers @entity142 and @entity144 ; shura council chairman @entity145 ; parliament speaker @entity146 ; and @entity148 chairman @entity147			0
in a televised speech friday night , the president said the attack occurred as talks were taking place between himself and affiliates of @entity35 , the @entity45 tribal leader whose break with @entity5 has been followed by spiraling violence			1
eyewitnesses , residents and government officials say @entity45 tribesmen were responsible			0
but the spokesman for @entity35 insisted this was not true			0
" the @entity164 tribesmen were not behind these attacks on the presidential palace and if they were , they would not deny it , " @entity163 said			0
in his speech , the president said those behind friday 's attacks were not connected with the youth - led movement in @entity20 's @entity86			1
rather , he said that " gangsters " perpetrated the strike as part of their bid to overthrow his government and destroy @entity2 's economic achievements			2
" i salute the armed forces everywhere and the courageous security forces who are keen on combating the attacks by a criminal gang that is acting outside of the law and is not affiliated with the youth 's revolution present in @entity86 , " @entity5 said			2
@entity188 , the spokesman for the @entity189 , @entity2 's largest opposition coalition , said " the attack on the palace was preplanned by president @entity5 to make people forget about the attacks that he has committed over the last two weeks			1
" @entity188 said @entity5 's forces have " bombarded most of the @entity35 family properties after the palace attack " and have killed hundreds over the past two weeks			1
according to the independent @entity198 , tensions escalated may 23 when fighting erupted between military forces controlled by " @entity5 's son and nephews and fighters loyal to the pre-eminent sheikh of the powerful @entity164 confederation , @entity35			1
" while @entity5 has been unpopular among many inside his country , he has been a longtime ally of the @entity207 in the war against terror			0
the @entity207 has counted on his government to be a bulwark against militants , including @entity212 , but it believes he should transfer power in order to maintain stability in the country			0
@entity218 spokesman @entity217 said on friday that @entity219 , the president 's homeland security adviser , traveled to @entity10 and the @entity221 for meetings with government officials to " discuss options to address the deteriorating situation " in @entity2			2
@entity102 has confirmed the deaths of 166 people in attacks by security forces and pro-government assailants on largely peaceful protesters since february			0
it said at least 130 people have died in heavy fighting since may 23 , though it could not confirm how many of those were civilians			0
@entity0 's @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 contributed to this report .			0
