the habits of coworkers can be irksome in the tight quarters of the modern office			1
being part of a team can be a great learning experience when collaboration and discussion lead to new ideas and career growth			1
but for some employees , like these professionals we talked to , interactions with co-workers range from merely irritating to being a complete nightmare			1
( to protect the innocent and the annoyed , some of these workers are only sharing their first names			2
) do any of these sound familiar ? the scented worker " i worked with a guy that smelled like dirty , wet rags			1
that was pretty annoying , " recalls @entity32 , a entrepreneur based in @entity33			1
the issue impacted @entity37 's productivity			2
" he smelled so terrible , it made my eyes water and it was very difficult to work with him as a result			1
" back away from the @entity43 ! many of us are irked by our fellow employees spending way too much time on personal phone calls or texting friends and family			1
and perhaps no device is more visible at work than the @entity43			2
" i had a co-worker who was on his @entity43 so much he 'd mastered blind - typing on it , " says @entity53 , an employee at @entity54 , an online retailer			2
unfortunately , the @entity43 - addicted team member could n't type , text and talk at the same time			1
" talking to him while he is busy typing was comparable to talking to a container of glue			0
" too much face time on @entity63 @entity64 , a consultant in @entity65 , found the allure of the internet severely curtailed her co-worker 's ability to get anything done			1
@entity64 's " no - worker " was particularly addicted to social networking sites			1
" she would spend the majority of the day on her @entity76 and @entity63 pages , which she took great pains to maintain , " she notes			1
in terms of actual work , @entity64 's teammate was n't too productive			1
" i 'd say she worked approximately two hours a day , and most of it had to be corrected or redone			1
" the bad behavior list those may have been some extreme examples , but co-workers can annoy us , rub us the wrong way and make us get our hate on for a number of reasons			2
if they 're not singing , our co-workers are chewing , slurping , sniffling , coughing or belching in a way that 's impossible for us to ignore			2
what are the most common reasons a fellow worker might be annoying ? they 're annoying you ( and all of us ) in many ways : he or she is a " @entity103 , " or has a consistently negative attitude at work			1
they 're incredibly nosy or prone to gossip			0
they bring aromatic food to their desks for lunch			0
tuna fish , broccoli and asparagus are just a few of our favorites			0
they use their cubicles as a spaces to take care of personal hygiene			2
everyone loves a fellow worker who clips his nails at his desk , right ? they leave common areas a mess , and do n't clean up after themselves			2
they play " hot potato " with responsibilities and pass the buck whenever possible			0
they 're constantly trying to one - up the competition			2
resolving conflict april @entity137 , a @entity138 - based trainer and facilitator , suggests several strategies to solve conflicts with irritating co-workers before they become major issues			1
ask for a resolution " greet each complaint or problem with the request for a solution , " @entity137 suggests			0
she believes this approach is less likely to put your co-worker on the defensive , but instead makes them part of the solution			0
just the facts , ma'am another strategy @entity137 likes is the " @entity158 strategy			0
" " when gossip , a complaint or negative information is brought forward , play @entity162 and document the facts			0
" @entity137 says that this approach defuses any potential sparks for greater conflict			0
" this will take the emotion out of the picture			0
" use humor any legitimate complaint about a co-worker should be taken seriously			0
but , minor conflict can often be resolved by using tactful humor so that the parties involved dial the intensity down a notch			0
be tactful workers should also remember that as irritating as some of these behaviors might be , there may be other factors that are catalysts to making them happen			0
excessive time on personal phone calls may be a sign of a personal crisis , while hygiene issues might arise from a medical problem			1
you or your manager should be fair , caring and empathetic when bringing up any issues with co-workers			1
they may not be aware that their actions are having an impact			0
" i used to work at a company where a managing director was famous for spotting two people having a conflict and taking them to a conference room and introducing them as if they had never met or talked , " recalls @entity198 , a @entity199 - based consultant who specializes in social media change management , business development and web marketing strategy			1
@entity198 believes it was an effective strategy			0
" that was the whole point -- to encourage people to talk about little things before they became big things , " he says			0
" the culture was one that encouraged people to reconcile with one another on their own			0

working in a team can be great , but it also can *reveal* annoying habits of co-workers
" i worked with a guy that smelled like dirty , wet rags , " says @entity32
@entity64 , of @entity65 , says a " no - worker " spends the day on social media sites
tact is advised ; hygiene issues may be medical , phone usage may be family crisis
