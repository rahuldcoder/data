-- since april , 117 law enforcement agencies in 18 states have decided to ignore @entity4 requests to keep foreign - born people in jail on suspicion they might be undocumented immigrants			1
these " detainers " ask local and county agencies to hold individuals up to 48 hours after local charges are resolved to allow @entity4 time to investigate their immigration status			1
@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 have seen the highest number of agencies changing their policies out of fear of being sued			2
the @entity20 in @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23 last week were the latest agencies to change their detainer policies			0
police agencies began reacting after several federal judges ruled that police were violating the constitutional rights by not releasing the immigrants after resolving their state charges			1
the advocacy group @entity31 says that more than 190 agencies in three states and the @entity34 enacted policies that reduce or eliminate cooperation with @entity4 detainers			1
but @entity4 spokesman @entity38 disputed that number , saying that " @entity4 is aware of 134 different law enforcement agencies throughout the country that are no longer honoring @entity4 detainers			1
" that number includes agencies that opted out before april			1
@entity44 , director of operations for the @entity45 , which represents most of the 3,083 sheriff 's agencies in the country , said the national organization has not taken an official position on the matter			0
" it 's not a viral movement , but it 's raising some legitimate legal issues , " @entity44			0
the @entity20 explained its new policy : " @entity20 will require orders of deportation or warrants signed by a federal judge / magistrate , or other court related order , to hold individuals beyond the time they would otherwise be released , " the agency said in a written statement			1
the issue boils down to due process , immigration advocates say			0
every person in the @entity71 -- citizen or illegal immigrant , has the same basic right of due process under the @entity75 , says south @entity21 immigration attorney @entity76			0
" detain first , ask questions later , " is the problem with @entity4 detainers , @entity76 said			2
" under our @entity75 , you have to have some reasonable reason to detain people			0
" in an @entity14 case , @entity83 pleaded guilty to violating a domestic restraining order and was sentenced to time served			0
@entity87 officials held @entity88 19 additional hours until transferring her into federal custody under an @entity4 detainer			1
she sued and on april 11 a federal judge found the county violated her @entity96 rights for unreasonable search and seizure by holding her without probable cause and with no warrant for her arrest			0
the federal judge in @entity14 cited other cases that @entity4 immigration detainers are " requests " -- and , therefore , not mandatory			1
@entity38 , in a written statement said , " when law enforcement agencies turn over criminals into @entity4 custody rather than into the community , it helps protect both public safety and the safety of law enforcement			1
" law enforcement sends fingerprints of anyone arrested in the @entity71 to the @entity119 and prints of those born outside the @entity71 are forwarded to @entity4 for an immigration status check			1
the @entity124 program , started under president @entity125 in 2008 and expanded largely under the @entity127 administration , was designed to prevent undocumented immigrants from committing serious crimes			0
@entity4 updated its policy last year and eliminated detainer requests for undocumenteds arrested for misdemeanors and petty crimes , saying its priority is to remove undocumented immigrants who commit serious crimes			2
in 2013 , @entity4 removed 368,644 immigrants from the @entity71			2
most were apprehended crossing the border illegally			0
of those arrested within the country , @entity4 says 82 % had been previously convicted of a crime			2
advocates for immigrants are concerned the increased deportations separate families , said @entity146 , an attorney with the @entity31			0
pro-immigrant groups have pushed hard for law enforcement agencies , and local and state government officials to change their detainer policies			1
the @entity151 focuses its online efforts to teach advocates how to best " explain the risk of civil liability if they continue to hold immigrants for @entity4 , " @entity146 said			1
" it 's not the local law enforcement 's job to do immigration enforcement , " @entity146 said			2
" they are to protect their local community , " said the advocate			0
the @entity163 in @entity164 , @entity21 , is taking steps to avoid legal pitfalls			0
in its decision to not enforce @entity4 detainers , its attorney cites two judges ' rulings against police agencies			1
" in light of these cases , personnel should not honor @entity4 detainers unless they are supported by probable cause , " wrote the sheriff 's legal in june			2
in @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity181 sheriff @entity180 disagreed with county commissioners decision to stop enforcing federal detainers			0
the sheriff said his organization will continue to honor the federal request since it keeps his community safe .			0
