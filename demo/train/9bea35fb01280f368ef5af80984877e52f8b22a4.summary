-- " this is a big change , consumers do n't always love change , and there 's a lot of education we have to provide to make sure that people understand			2
" this is the extremely diplomatic way @entity10 chief marketing and strategy officer @entity11 spun his reaction to the pr challenges surrounding the @entity14 of late			1
and it 's true , consumers around the world ( and around the @entity17 ) loudly expressed how much they dislike the changes @entity20 announced to its game licensing terms ( and online requirements ) for the @entity14 last thursday , giving @entity23 the ammunition it needed to win @entity25 by basically doing nothing			1
the reaction was n't a surprise to @entity11 , though			1
in fact , he said a lot of the way people have responded to @entity20 's moves was " kind of as we expected			0
" but the implication of his statements in an in - depth interview with @entity37 was that this temporary confusion and discomfort among the audience would be worth it as gamers and consumers adjust to a console world without game discs			2
" we 're trying to do something pretty big in terms of moving the industry forward for console gaming into the digital world			2
we believe the digital world is the future , and we believe digital is better			2
" @entity11 made a comparison to the world of home movie viewing , where inconvenient trips to @entity58 have been replaced with @entity60 streaming on practically any device instantly			1
on @entity14 , having all games exist as cloud - connected downloads enables new features like being able to access your entire library at a friend 's house with a single login , or loaning games to up to ten " family members " digitally and remotely			1
those digital " benefits " will be available at launch , but @entity11 hinted that the digital rights management transition might unlock some more interesting game access and distribution methods later on			1
" in the future , you can imagine the capability to have different licensing models , different ways that people have to access games			2
this all gets unlocked because of digital			2
" he would n't get drawn into details , but when i suggested ideas like an " all - you - can - play " @entity60 for games or purely digital game rentals , he did n't shoot me down			2
it could be a variety of ways			0
" he also suggested that the transition to a world of strictly downloadable and online - connected games would help allow for " a diversity of business models " for publishers to take advantage of , from free - to - play titles to $ 60 aaa games to @entity106 games somewhere in between			1
" as you go into a digital world , what 's happening is publishers are choosing to have different business models and consumers are saying ' hey , if i ca n't resell the title , provide me a different way to get value to get into your game			1
' and we think the market will be efficient in finding good models that work for consumers			0
" in essence , @entity11 said , consumer demand for good value from games will drive prices down , even if a publisher decides to fully cut off the market release valve of used game resale			1
publishers , of course , have been the most forceful proponents of cutting off the used game market , with some suggesting that used games are comparable to piracy for their bottom line			0
but @entity11 said that @entity20 was n't simply " giving in " to publisher demands with its new game licensing terms			1
instead , it was trying to balance the needs of its four main " constituents , " including the consumer ( who comes " first and foremost " he said ) , game publishers , retailers , and @entity20 itself as a company			0
" within that , we 've tried to optimize , and i think we 've found a great balance across all of those dimensions , " @entity11 said			1
" but there are tradeoffs			0
" we do want to support everyone in that system , beginning with the consumer			0
but we want publishers to get paid for the great ip they work on			0
we want retailers to be able to drive and sell our products and make a profit			0
so we are trying to balance across all those			0
" @entity11 noted that purely digital game marketplaces like the @entity164 have thrived despite having absolutely no physical media			1
implementing that kind of disc - free system on the @entity14 " may not [ have been ] the best thing for consumers , and it may not [ have been ] the thing they [ would have ] wanted , " @entity11 said , which is part of why @entity20 decided to keep discs as an option			1
still , he did concede that , without discs , the licensing norms for the system " would be easier to understand			0
" the way @entity11 talked about @entity20 's licensing decisions reinforced the idea that he saw the limited abilities to share and transfer @entity14 games as a step up from other , purely digital marketplaces , even if some others see it as a step down from current disc - based distribution systems			1
on the @entity14 , @entity11 said the company has " tried to ... bridge the two in a way that no one has done -- to give you the power of digital and then give you all this power in physical ...			1
we know we 're providing a lot more value to consumers , but in that comes a lot of need to clarify , ' how come disc ? how come digital ? how 's that work ? ' " while the @entity17 is decidedly up in arms about the way the @entity14 handles game ownership and online check - ins , @entity11 said it was " hard to say " what the larger reaction from the less attentive mainstream consumers would be			1
" i think it 's fair to say there 's a segment of consumers at this show in particular who really pay attention , who are very passionate about all aspects of gaming , and that we listen to closely			0
in a broader set of community , people do n't pay attention to a lot of the details			0
we 've seen it in the research , we 've seen it in a lot of the data points			0
" one data point in particular @entity239 pointed to was the success of the initial pre-orders for the @entity14 , which started as soon as @entity20 's press conference concluded monday			2
" @entity243 basically says they are on path to sell out ...			1
@entity243 is saying it 's one of their best - selling consumer products			2
we 're seeing the same thing from other retailers			0
" to be fair , @entity250 pre-orders were also a quick sell - out on @entity243 after the company 's press conference on monday			1
still , " it 's very clear there are a wide variety of other consumers that love to game that are excited about what we have to offer with @entity14 , " @entity11 said			1
while the @entity14 will sell for $ 100 more than the @entity250 , @entity11 suggested that the extra money spent would be worthwhile to consumers looking for the best value in their next gaming system			1
besides exclusive titles and gaming content , @entity11 said players would see value in the system being " backed by 300,000 servers backed by @entity20 that enable incredible game experiences			2
" for another , the @entity272 in each box provides for better gameplay and " ease of use for the entire system			0
" things like live tv support and exclusive @entity282 and @entity283 partnerships will also help show consumers the @entity14 's " tremendous value			2
" " we want to have our offering be differentiated relative to all others , " he said			0
" it has value that is in so many areas that is not in competing systems ...			0
that is a thing that each consumer will choose ... and ultimately consumers will decide which is better			0
it 's a big market			0
