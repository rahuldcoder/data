-- along the lush sea - islands and the @entity5 coastal plains of the southern @entity6 of @entity7 , a distinctive group of tidewater communities has stuck together throughout the centuries , preserving its @entity10 cultural heritage and carving out a lifestyle that is uniquely its own			1
the @entity14 / @entity13 people are direct descendants of @entity10 slaves brought into the @entity16 around the 1700s			1
they were forced to work in rice paddies , cotton fields and indigo plantations along the @entity23 - @entity22 seaboard where the moist climate and fertile land were very similar to their @entity10 homelands			1
after the abolition of slavery , they settled in remote villages around the coastal swath , where , thanks to their relative isolation , they formed strong communal ties and a unique culture that has endured for centuries			0
" the @entity39 is an extremely tightly knit community , " says @entity38 , who was chosen to represent the @entity14 / @entity13 people in 2000			1
" it is as tightly knit as a sweet grass basket that 's sewn together and as tightly knit as a cast net is sewn together -- there 's strength in it and that means if you pull on it , you ca n't just get it to break apart			0
" see also : tracing the slaves who shaped @entity7 brought to @entity7 from rice - producing @entity51 and other surrounding countries , the enslaved @entity50 came from a wide variety of ethnic groups			1
for many of them , the first contact with the @entity56 was @entity59 -- just off @entity60 , @entity23 -- a place of huge emotional value for the @entity14 / @entity13 community to this day			1
" this is the landing point for over 40 % of all the @entity10 people enslaved in @entity7 , " says @entity38			1
" it represents a place of pain ; it also represents a place of connection because we 're standing at the shore and we 're looking eastward -- we 're looking back home , we 're looking to our mother , the mother land , mother @entity10			2
" @entity77 , minister of information of the @entity39 , says the @entity50 brought to the island were quarantined in pestilence houses to make sure they did n't have any diseases			2
" a lot of people refer to this as the @entity84 , but it 's not , because we did not come freely , " says @entity77			2
" it did n't kill the spirit , because we are here today and paying homage today to our ancestors			2
it actually gave us a sense of community , of living together			0
everything we did , it was a way for us to actually become who we are			0
it actually made us stronger and we continue today the legacy of our ancestors			2
" read related : @entity99 's thriving @entity10 culture to this day , the @entity14 / @entity13 people are trying to hold steadfastly to the way of life of their @entity10 ancestors , passing on their traditions from one generation to the next			1
they gather sweet grass to practice the ancient @entity10 art of basket making ; they pay homage to their @entity10 traditions by keeping alive the ring shout music folk tradition ; they make a living by fishing shrimps and harvesting oysters , using handmade nets and casting them the way their ancestors did centuries ago			1
" i fished with my father ever since i 've been seven or eight , " says @entity120 , vice president of the @entity121			0
" it passes down because it 's just a natural thing for us -- my parents did it , i 'm quite sure my parents ' parents did it , and it just descended down			0
" it is this natural connection that helps the @entity14 / @entity13 community tie their past to their future survival			1
" [ it 's ] almost like history repeating itself , what goes around comes around , " says @entity120			0
" ok , we 've entered the computer age , but we still have to have hands - on for most of the things we do and fishing is like hands - on			0
you 've got to do it to know it -- to keep the culture strong is to keep what you do intact			0
" another key trait marking the population 's distinctive cultural identity is the use of an @entity153 - based creole vernacular known as @entity14			1
professor @entity154 , of the department of linguistics at the @entity157 , says the enslaved @entity50 and their descendants created the dialect in response to their own linguistic diversity			0
" it is @entity153 modified under the influence of african languages , " he says			0
" any population that appropriates the language that is not their own , they are going to modify it			0
" estimates about the current number of @entity14 / @entity13 people vary and exact figures are hard to verify			1
@entity14 / @entity13 leaders say that an approximately one million people belong to the nation , while other reports put the number closer to 250,000			1
@entity154 says that after the @entity180 there were several migrations out of the region towards cities like @entity184 and @entity185 in search of jobs			0
he adds , however , that many of those who 'd depart would often become disenchanted with life in the city and return back home			0
watch video : slave descendants uphold @entity10 roots what seems to be more certain is that @entity14 / @entity13 people have preserved the cultural heritage of their ancestors more than any other black @entity16 in the @entity16			1
" we have the highest retention of @entity10 tradition in @entity7 , " says @entity77			1
" african - americans have assimilated more so they do n't have those @entity10 traditions that we have -- they do n't treasure them , they do n't honor their tradition like we do			1
and we 've been able to hold onto that because of isolation , because of the strong will and our self - determination			2
we still eat the same foods [ as ] our ancestors [ when they ] came from @entity10			2
he says the @entity14 / @entity13 people cook differently from continental african - americans and the ways they interact with each other are very reminiscent of traditional life in @entity10			1
" they have also kept animal tales that are very similar to animal tales in @entity10 , " he adds			2
" the characters are not exactly the same , because the ecology has changed , but the themes of the tales are very similar to the themes that you find in @entity10			2
" back on @entity59 , overlooking the vast ocean that brought her ancestors to the shores of enslavement , @entity77 says @entity14 / @entity13 people should not lose sight of their past			1
" this is actually the bloodline of our people , the water , " she says			0
" i must come here and my children come here			0
and my children 's children must come here too			0
because we must never forget			0
