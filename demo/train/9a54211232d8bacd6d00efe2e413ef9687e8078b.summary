@entity0 , @entity1 -- official results have yet to be published , but preliminary returns appear to show that the once - banned moderate @entity6 party @entity5 has won @entity1 's historic elections , according to several political parties and @entity1 media outlets			1
on tuesday night , victory celebrations erupted outside the modest office building in downtown @entity0 where @entity5 is headquartered			1
a crowd of about a hundred party supporters gathered , singing the national anthem , clapping and chanting			2
tunisians awoke tuesday to the front page of @entity17 newspaper , which featured a giant photo of @entity5 leader @entity19 next to a saluting member of the presidential guard , with the caption " @entity5 close to the government ? " meanwhile , the @entity25 - language daily @entity24 depicted a presidential throne on a pillar carrying the @entity5 logo , followed by smaller chairs atop two smaller columns labeled with the secular parties @entity31 pour @entity32 ( @entity33 ) and @entity34			1
@entity35 , secretary - general of the @entity36 for the @entity37 , told reporters at a news conference tuesday afternoon that preliminary results were available for five districts			1
of the 39 seats available in those districts , @entity5 took 15 , @entity33 took six and @entity34 took four			1
those results still must be certified , he said			2
representatives from all three parties told @entity2 their own preliminary results showed that @entity5 captured first place , followed by @entity33 and @entity34			1
the parties were already looking forward to the possibility of establishing a governing coalition in the future 217 - seat @entity52			1
" it 's possible ... i hope we can put a coalition of this type together , " said cpr leader @entity54 , when asked about the possibility of establishing a coalition of the three apparent front - runners			1
@entity54 said @entity1 had demonstrated in the country 's first free election in modern history their vision for the future of the country			2
" tunisians want centrist politics , " he said			0
" they want an @entity71 - @entity70 identity ( @entity5 ) and also democracy and human rights represented by the two parties @entity33 and @entity34			1
" the vote was historic not only in @entity1 -- which , until now , had n't had a national election since it became independent in 1956 and for 23 years was ruled by @entity78 @entity77 -- but also in the region and the world			0
since @entity77 was ousted in january -- a month after 26 - year - old street vendor @entity81 set himself afire after a police officer seized his goods -- residents in several other @entity71 nations have similarly rallied for democratic reforms and against their leaders , many of whom held power for decades and allowed little dissent			0
@entity93 , the head of the country 's election commission , said monday that more than 80 % of the @entity98 nation 's registered voters cast ballots sunday			2
according to @entity101 , 4,100,812 people registered to vote prior to the election in a country of more than 10 million			0
but @entity93 said many unregistered voters -- " mostly youth and women " -- showed up sunday for last - minute registration			2
as early as monday night , top @entity5 party officials were already celebrating cpr and @entity34 's expected second and third place finishes in the vote count			1
" we 're happy that the second and third party are serious parties that never resorted to scare tactics , " said @entity111 , @entity19 's chief of staff			2
but the rise of a party closely identified with @entity116 sounded alarm bells for @entity1 secularists			0
tuesday afternoon , a group of about 200 protesters gathered outside the headquarters of @entity1 's electoral commission to denounce the expected @entity5 victory			1
some carried signs saying " no to fraud			0
" meanwhile , the mood was gloomy in @entity0 ' upscale neighborhood of @entity129 , where patrons at a swish coffee shop were commiserating about @entity5 's apparent victory			1
" we are scared about losing some freedom , some rights			2
especially women are scared , " said @entity136 , who works for a company that distributes beer			0
but in an interview with @entity2 , the daughter of @entity5 's leader insisted women like @entity136 have nothing to fear			1
" i 'm a @entity1 woman			0
i 'd be the first concerned if there was a change			0
i 'm a working woman , i 'm active in civil society , " said @entity147 , an academic who lived in exile for 22 years until last january 's revolution			0
" i personally do n't see any contradiction between @entity116 and ... women 's rights			1
" @entity19 said that she hoped @entity154 would provide an democratic model to other @entity6 political movements in the region , such as @entity159 's @entity158			0
" that 's the lesson @entity154 can give other @entity6 movements in the region			0
its how we work together with other political parties in spite of ideological differences			0
its really a practical program of change			0
