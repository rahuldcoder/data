@entity0 -- two @entity4 air marshals who arrested the wife of a @entity7 judge on a flight to @entity9 -- and were themselves arrested and had their passports confiscated by @entity7 authorities -- fled the country using alternate travel documents rather than face what they believed to be trumped - up charges , sources said			1
the incident has impacted air marshal operations on flights to @entity7 , officials said , and air marshals contacted by @entity1 said the case raises questions about @entity7 's willingness to support future law enforcement actions by @entity4 officials on international flights			1
the incident occurred on october 1 on @entity29 128 from @entity30 , @entity31 , to @entity9			1
during the flight , a female passenger who appeared to be intoxicated tried to serve herself drinks by going to the plane 's galley , one source said			1
the plane 's crew asked air marshals to intervene , and two marshals approached the woman , who began struggling with them			2
two sources said the woman bit one of the air marshals , and she was handcuffed and placed under arrest			2
at the @entity9 airport , the air marshals went to turn over the woman to local authorities but were themselves brought before a federal judge and charged with misdemeanor counts of assault , sources said			1
@entity7 authorities took the air marshals ' passports , so they could not leave the country and set a court hearing for the following week , sources said			1
" they ( @entity7 officials ) did not want them to leave			0
they were not free to go , " one @entity4 law enforcement source said			0
but the air marshals used alternate travel documents and quietly departed the country on a commercial flight that same day without the knowledge of the @entity7 court officials who had sought their detention			1
one source said the air marshals believed the charges against them were retaliatory because the passenger they arrested is the wife of a prominent @entity7 judge			1
the air marshals believed it was to their benefit to leave the country and let the @entity4 and @entity7 governments resolve the dispute , the source said			1
the air marshals had not recovered their passports when they left , the sources said			2
a @entity85 official , contacted by @entity1 on the day of the incident , confirmed that air marshals had confronted a " disruptive passenger " on @entity89 , and said that @entity4 officials were working with their @entity7 counterparts to resolve " an issue , " which the official declined to discuss			1
shortly before midnight the day of the incident , the @entity85 official said the air marshal team had left @entity7 , but the official did not elaborate on the circumstances			2
@entity4 officials on october 1 and again this week declined to discuss the circumstances in which the air marshals left @entity7			1
but , commenting about the incident on board the aircraft , an official said , " we believe our federal air marshals acted appropriately within the provisions of the @entity108 ( @entity109 )			2
" air marshals and union representatives contacted by @entity1 say it is important that @entity7 and other nations recognize law enforcement actions taken by air marshals during international flights			1
" in theory we 're all working together to combat the threat of terrorism and we should not let egos or marital relations impact proper procedure and legal protocols , " said @entity117 , national president for the union that represents air marshals			2
numerous sources said the issue is still unresolved			0
according to court documents in @entity7 , after the air marshals missed a scheduled court appointment on october 6 , the court contacted the @entity4 @entity132 in an attempt to get the air marshals ' addresses			1
on tuesday , homeland security secretary @entity136 met with @entity7 minister of defense @entity137 to discuss strengthening the global aviation system			0
the @entity4 and @entity7 signed a " joint statement of intent on aviation security			0
" a @entity143 official said the parties did not discuss the @entity29 128 incident or its aftermath			0
sources said they believe the two agents remain charged in @entity7 courts			0
they did not know if the agents ' passports had been returned to them or the @entity4 government			0
@entity154 officials have declined to comment on the incident , but said it is not affecting relations with @entity7			0
" we 've got broad , deep relations with @entity7 , " @entity154 spokesman @entity158 said			0
" we have many , many areas of cooperation with @entity7			0
and on those areas where we have had disagreements , or rather issues to address , and challenges , we 've worked through them quite effectively			0
" a call to the @entity132 in @entity0 on thursday was not immediately returned			0
