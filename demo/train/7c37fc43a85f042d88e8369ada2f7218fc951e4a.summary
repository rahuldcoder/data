-- @entity1 plans to challenge a @entity3 court ruling that recommends more than $ 1 billion in damages to @entity5 over a patent dispute			1
a federal jury recommended friday that @entity5 be awarded the damages after finding @entity1 guilty of " willful " violations of a number of @entity5 's patents in the creation of its own mobile products			1
in a statement , @entity1 said it will " move immediately to file post-verdict motions to overturn this decision in this court , and if we are not successful , we will appeal this decision to the court of appeals			1
" the jury did not recommend awarding @entity1 any money in its counterclaims that @entity5 had violated some of its patents			1
" this is a huge win for @entity5 , " @entity27 , a @entity28 law professor , said in an e-mail			2
the award " is just large enough to make it the largest surviving patent verdict in history			0
" in aftermarket trading , @entity5 stock jumped more than $ 12 a share , to more than $ 675 a share			2
@entity1 said the verdict should be viewed " as a loss for the @entity3 consumer			2
" @entity42 : what the @entity5 - @entity1 verdict means for your smartphone " it will lead to fewer choices , less innovation , and potentially higher prices , " the company said in a statement			1
" it is unfortunate that patent law can be manipulated to give one company a monopoly over rectangles with rounded corners , or technology that is being improved every day by @entity1 and other companies			1
" consumers have the right to choices , and they know what they are buying when they purchase @entity1 products			2
this is not the final word in this case or in battles being waged in courts and tribunals around the world , some of which have already rejected many of @entity5 's claims			2
@entity1 will continue to innovate and offer choices for the consumer			2
" @entity5 praised the court for " sending a loud and clear message that stealing is n't right			2
" " the mountain of evidence presented during the trial showed that @entity1 's copying went far deeper than even we knew , " the company said in a statement			1
an issue still to be decided is whether to grant injunctions that could prevent @entity1 from selling products that infringe on @entity5 's patents			1
judge @entity90 wanted both sides to be ready for a hearing on the matter in two weeks , but @entity1 's team argued that was n't enough time			0
a hearing was scheduled for september 20			0
@entity5 had asked for $ 2.7 billion in damages , claiming that @entity1 " ripped off " its @entity100 and @entity101 designs			1
@entity1 countersued @entity5 for infringing on five of its patents and asked for $ 519 million			1
a nine - person jury spent two and a half days puzzling out its final verdict			0
jury members used weeks of notes and memories of testimony , 109 pages of jury instructions , and boxes of evidence , including a collection of contested smartphones and tablets as their guide			0
the jurors had to complete a complicated 20 - page verdict form filled with charts and yes or no answers to determine exactly which device violated what patents and which companies were responsible			0
finally , they had to calculate the final damages amounts			0
each side was given 30 minutes to go over the form and search for inconsistencies			0
judge @entity130 and @entity1 spotted a problem with the damages amount for a @entity134 model			0
after being sent back to the jury for reconsideration , the total amount of damages was bumped down by about $ 2.5 million , to $ 1,049,343,540			0
after the trial was over , all nine jurors opted to leave through a back door of the courthouse to avoid speaking with the mass of reporters waiting at the front entrance			0
the lawsuit is the largest yet in the ongoing worldwide patent brawl between the two companies , which itself is just one battle in @entity5 's war against @entity154 's @entity153 mobile operating system			1
on august 24 , a @entity156 court found that both parties had infringed on each other 's patents , banning the sale of the @entity161 , @entity101 4 , two @entity100 models and @entity1 's @entity163			0
the @entity156 court ordered @entity5 to pay @entity1 $ 35,000 and @entity1 to pay @entity5 $ 22,000			1
19 incredible @entity5 secrets revealed in court @entity0 's @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
