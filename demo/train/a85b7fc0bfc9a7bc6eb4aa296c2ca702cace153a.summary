-- pirates seized control of a cargo vessel near the @entity4 thursday , one of two attacks that took place within minutes of each other off the coast of east @entity10 , according to the @entity11			1
the @entity12 say attacks off the east coast of @entity10 have increased this year			1
the @entity16 maritime patrol responded to the early morning attacks , along with the @entity18			2
the crew of the @entity21 - flagged @entity20 said two pirates had boarded the vessel before communication was cut off with the crew			1
the @entity16 force confirmed that six pirates have boarded the 180 - meter long bulk carrier , with two attack skiffs in tow			1
they hoisted the " mother skiff " onto the vessel with a crane , the @entity16 force said			2
a second attempted hijacking took place at approximately the same time , but the @entity38 - flagged cargo ship evaded the attack , the @entity16 said			1
armed with automatic weapons and rocket - propelled grenades , pirates opened fire on the @entity44 about 460 miles ( 740 km ) east of @entity45 , @entity46			1
a @entity48 warship , part of the @entity16 force , responded to the attack , which caused no casualties			0
the 200 - meter @entity20 @entity44 continued its voyage			1
pirate attacks off the coast of east @entity10 have significantly increased this year , according to the @entity12 , which monitors shipping crimes			1
but successful attacks have gone down as a result of a strong presence of international monitors			2
the first nine months of this year has seen more pirate attacks than all of last year , the bureau reported on wednesday			1
from january 1 until september 30 , pirates worldwide mounted 306 attacks , compared with 293 in all of 2008 , it said			1
more than half of this year 's attacks were carried out by suspected @entity69 pirates off the east coast of @entity69 and in the @entity71 , a major shipping route between @entity73 and @entity69			1
out of those attacks , @entity69 pirates successfully hijacked 32 vessels and took 533 hostages			1
eight others were wounded , four more killed and one is missing , the bureau said			0
on monday , pirates hijacked a @entity83 merchant ship and its 25 - member crew about 630 miles ( 1,000 km ) northeast of @entity4			1
the pirates appeared to be heading toward @entity69 , the @entity11 said			1
@entity83 plans to make " every effort to rescue " the crew members , @entity88 spokesman @entity87 , told reporters			0
the bulk carrier @entity92 is one of four ships that @entity69 pirates are holding for ransom with 80 crew members as hostages , the @entity12 said wednesday			2
maritime authorities say two recent trends have led to a rise in piracy : access and opportunity			0
as global commerce picks up , more and more of the world 's fuels , minerals and other crucial commodities travel by ship			0
ninety - five percent of @entity111 's foreign trade , for instance , moves by water , according to the @entity114			2
that cargo is an easy target for robbers in countries that lack the resources to secure their shorelines , such as @entity69			2
@entity69 's transitional government , which has a tenuous grip on power , has been unable to stop the pirates -- many of whom are based in the country 's port cities			2
this has prompted @entity130 and other @entity132 countries to step up maritime patrols			0
" in the @entity71 , the number of attacks have gone up			0
but because of the presence of naval vessels , the success rate of the pirates have decreased , " said @entity136 , manager of the @entity12			0
" the navies are responding very very effectively			0
" piracy accelerated after the fall of the @entity69 government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms			0
those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions			0
with the ransoms they collect , pirates can earn up to $ 40,000 a year , analysts say			2
that 's a fortune for someone from an impoverished country			0
some analysts say companies are simply making the problem worse by paying the piracies			0
" yes , the ransoms have probably caused the piracy to become a bit more rampant			0
but at the same time , from the owner 's point of view , there is no other way currently to secure the safe release of the vessel along with the crew and the cargo , " @entity136 said			1
" it 's basically a cycle			0
" @entity0 's @entity171 contributed to this report			0
