@entity0 , @entity1 -- the captain of the cruise ship that wrecked off @entity1 's western coast will be questioned by authorities tuesday at a hearing , his attorney said			1
@entity10 is under arrest and may face charges that include manslaughter , shipwreck , and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board , according to @entity1 prosecutor @entity18			1
@entity19 could face up to 15 years in prison , he said			0
at the closed hearing , a preliminary investigation judge will decide whether @entity19 will remain detained			1
the captain has not yet been questioned , but more than 100 witnesses , including passengers and crew , have been interviewed , the prosecutor said			1
the captain 's attorney , @entity28 , said in a statement monday that @entity19 was " shattered , dismayed , saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed			1
" but , he said , @entity19 is " nonetheless comforted by the fact that he maintained during those moments the necessary lucidity to put in place a difficult emergency maneuver ... bringing the ship to shallow waters			1
" that move , @entity28 said , saved the lives of many passengers and crew members			1
@entity1 prosecutors have ruled out a technical error as the cause of the incident , saying the captain was on the bridge at the time and had made a " grave error			1
" overheard on @entity2 : worst - case scenario strikes late monday , the head of @entity1 's coast guard said 29 people remained unaccounted for from the partially sunken cruise ship @entity58 -- a sharp spike from earlier estimates of the missing			1
coast guard chief @entity64 said the whereabouts of four crew members and 25 passengers were unknown , @entity1 's @entity63 news agency reported			1
authorities earlier believed that 16 people were unaccounted for			1
the @entity58 hit rocks friday night just off @entity1 's western coast , leading to what passengers described as a chaotic and surreal scene to evacuate and the deaths of at least six people			1
on monday , rescue efforts were ongoing in and around the mammoth vessel , which was listing on its side off the island of @entity0			1
the search had been suspended earlier in the day because the vessel began to move , said the island 's mayor , @entity82			1
@entity84 spokesman @entity84 said efforts had resumed , adding that rescuers will focus on retrieving the body of a man , presumably a passenger , discovered earlier in the day			1
however , he said the weather forecast has rescuers worried , as it calls for rising winds			0
the head of the company that owns the ship said monday he has not given up hope of finding survivors			1
" @entity100 is the last thing to die , " said @entity98 chairman and chief executive pier @entity97			0
he addressed journalists at an emotional press conference monday , apologizing repeatedly for the accident			0
prosecutors are examining the ship 's data recorder and expect to have results within days , @entity18 said			1
they are also considering whether others may share responsibility for the crash with the captain			1
@entity97 placed blame for the wreck squarely on the captain , however , saying @entity19 had deviated from frequently traveled routes			2
" the captain decided to change the route and he went into water that he did not know in advance , " @entity97 said			2
he said the company was limited in its ability to investigate the incident because it did not have the data recorder			0
@entity19 , who has been with @entity98 since 2002 , had never been involved in an accident before , @entity97 said			0
he downplayed the possibility that alcohol may have played a role in the crash , saying he did not believe @entity19 drank , and that all crew were subject to random drug and alcohol tests by @entity98			2
the company had said earlier that @entity19 may have made " significant " errors that led to the wreck			0
" the route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore , and the captain 's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard @entity98 procedures , " @entity98 said in a statement sunday			1
the ship had about 2,300 tons of fuel on board at the time of the wreck , @entity97 said monday , adding that so far there was " absolutely no evidence of fuel leaking into the sea			2
" divers have been searching the skyscraper - sized ship , working underwater in pitch blackness , in hopes of finding the missing			2
there were roughly 4,200 people on the @entity58 when it ran aground			1
among those unaccounted for were two @entity162			2
the @entity163 identified them monday as @entity164 and @entity165			0

their daughter , @entity178 , told @entity179 in @entity180 that the couple was planning to travel after retiring , @entity175 said			0
the disaster 's impact on earnings will cost the ship 's owner at least $ 85 million to $ 95 million in the fiscal year to november , parent company @entity182 said monday -- not including " other costs to the business that are not possible to determine at this time			1
" @entity97 said passengers would get " material compensation for their loss , " but declined to go into details			2
the ship is expected to be out of service " for the remainder of the current fiscal year if not longer , " the company said			2
@entity19 joined @entity98 as a safety officer in 2002 before being appointed captain four years later , the company said			2
even with its admission that mistakes were made , the @entity204 - based cruise company defended the ship 's crew in the face of criticism on the part of some passengers , who said the crew appeared helpless and overwhelmed as passengers rushed for lifeboats			1
" it is becoming clear that the crew of the @entity58 acted bravely and swiftly to help evacuate more than 4,000 individuals during a very challenging situation , " the company said , adding all crew members are trained and the passengers earlier took part in an evacuation drill			1
survivors have described the scene -- after the ship hit rocks near @entity0 , off the coast of @entity230 , and turned over on its side -- as chaos			1
" there was no one taking command , " passenger @entity233 told @entity235 's @entity234			2

" it was a terrifying sound and we knew it was n't normal , " she said			0
@entity233 ran to her cabin and then to board a lifeboat			0

others had no choice and fell in			0
nighttime temperatures on @entity0 have recently dipped below freezing			0

questions and criticism continue about what caused the shipwreck and the adequacy of the response			0
speaking on @entity1 television , the ship 's captain insisted the rocks that the @entity58 hit were not marked on his map			1
" on the nautical chart , it was marked just as water , " @entity19 said , adding that the ship was about 328 yards ( 300 meters ) from shore			2
but @entity293 spokesman @entity293 insisted that the waters where the ship ran aground were well - mapped			0
