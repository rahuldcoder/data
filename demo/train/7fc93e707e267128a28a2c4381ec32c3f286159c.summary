-- i 'd never been one of those girls who 'd dreamt about her perfect wedding			2
the white wedding dress , the exorbitant costs , the fuss over a big , shiny rock -- none of it ever appealed to me			0
i wanted to find a lifelong partner , and a family sounded nice , too , but honestly ? i never cared much about that piece of paper			0
so why did i just marry my boyfriend after pondering it for a mere two hours ? one reason : health insurance			1
my now - husband is a bartender and a student whose school 's insurance is exorbitant			1
the man had n't gone to the doctor in years , living in fear of a major accident or illness			1
we had lived together for about eight months when i got a job as a reporter for a newspaper with a kick - ass medical plan			1
according to my job , a domestic partnership affidavit was standing in the way of my partner having awesome coverage and escaping $ 8000 worth of retroactive hospital bills			1
it was a no - brainer			2
onto domestic partnership ! problem is , the state of @entity42 does n't let you get domestic partnership if you 're hetero			1
( " if they could , no one would get married ! " the @entity48 employee informed me smugly , as if 1 ) that fact was actually true and 2 ) rampant domestic partnerships would mean the @entity51			2
) apparently you ca n't be a part of the " system " if you 're queer , and you ca n't opt out of the " system " if you 're straight			0
it started to seem so ridiculously arbitrary -- and unfair ! did i really have to choose between leaving my honey vulnerable to unthinkable medical costs and a measly $ 50 certificate ? the choice was clear			0
we went ahead and got married			0
the weird thing was n't the actual @entity48 wedding ( it was actually sort of fun ! ) , it was watching people react to the news			0
some were angry -- " how could you have gotten married without me there ? " my best friend implored , crushed			0
others were confused -- " really , @entity73 ? i thought you were n't into that sorta stuff			0
" the @entity0 : got engaged but not really in love with man but the most common reaction was voyeuristic elation -- from everyone , even my long - lost elementary school friends on @entity82			2
it was like i had become part of some coveted club , or even a higher - class citizen			1
i understood more than ever why gay marriage was such a big deal			0
i also started to get why people become so wrapped up in weddings			0
all eyes are on you			0
suddenly , everybody loves you ! the @entity0 : boyfriend better give me good gifts mine is a situation that 's left me contemplating my principles			0
by getting insurance - married on the fly , did i " give in " or did i beat tradition ? maybe a little bit of both ? i have nothing against weddings -- nothing 's better than a celebration of love -- and if my husband and i decide to get married " for real , " i 'm sure we 'll have an epic one			1
but the government certificate thing has always made me indignant , especially nowadays when the health insurance crisis looms large			1
why should one be able to have health insurance more easily because they happen to be heterosexual ? or , for that matter , if they believe in the institution of marriage enough to support it ? the @entity0 : @entity120 magical at @entity121 either way , our shotgun wedding was just as much of a gesture of love as anything else			1
people get married for a lot worse reasons than ensuring their loved one 's health , safety , and peace of mind			2
and at the very least , now i know my vow of " in sickness and in health " is backed up by a @entity140 insurance plan			1

after living together for months , couple marries to get him health insurance
they were denied a domestic partnership by state of @entity42
he was student , but *university* insurance was too costly
bride now feels like *member* of some coveted club , a higher - class citizen
