@entity0 -- president @entity3 's decision to seek congressional authorization of a military attack against the @entity7 government is in part his way of trying to fix a legal problem			1
the president 's decision to launch military strikes that would be " limited in duration and scope " is illegal under international law , legal experts say			1
the @entity19 charter generally does n't allow nations to attack other nations unless the attack is in self - defense or has the approval of the @entity25 , neither of which is the case in @entity7			2
that 's a problem for a president , who has tried to distinguish his administration from that of president @entity32 on the idea that he is bringing the @entity34 back into compliance with international law			1
@entity1 has learned that the @entity38 ' @entity37 provided the president with a preliminary legal opinion on carrying out the @entity7 attack			1
@entity37 lawyers are the ones who advise the president on whether he is acting lawfully under federal statutes and the @entity47			2
the opinion was provided verbally to the @entity49 and is expected to be followed with a formal written opinion in coming weeks			0
the exact legal reasoning in the opinion could not be learned but sources familiar with the matter said the president 's legal team believes he is acting lawfully			1
is it ' @entity57 ' for @entity3 on @entity7 ? to help bolster the president 's legal case , the @entity3 administration over the weekend asked @entity61 to authorize the use of military force			1
it 's a departure for the president , who did n't seek similar approval when the @entity34 joined a @entity19 - sanctioned bombing campaign in @entity68			2
but it is more in line with the view that @entity3 expressed as a senator and presidential candidate , that presidents need congressional approval to wage war			1
congressional approval would n't solve the problem with international law , a senior administration official said , but it would enhance the legitimacy of military action			1
@entity3 , in a @entity84 statement saturday , spoke of the humanitarian and moral reasons to respond to what the @entity34 says is clear proof that @entity7 president @entity90 's forces have used chemical weapons against civilians			1
@entity3 called the most recent alleged chemical weapons attack near @entity94 " an assault on human dignity			2
" a senior administration official acknowledged the international legal constraints but said the president is authorized to take action with or without @entity61 , in part for @entity34 national security reasons			1
the president in his saturday statement said the use of chemical weapons against civilians poses " a serious danger to our national security			0
" the administration uses similar language in the @entity113 proposal it is presenting to @entity61 , citing the need to protect the @entity34 and its allies and partners from the threat of chemical weapons			0
a second senior administration official said the @entity34 is acting on humanitarian as well as security grounds			1
" we are not trying to address all of the humanitarian aspects of the crisis , but the security and humanitarian elements of the situation are inextricably linked and it would be artificial to separate them , " the official said			0
" the security situation endangers the welfare of the populations in the region , and the humanitarian situation -- including the flows of refugees and displaced persons -- endangers the security and stability of countries in the region			0
" @entity143 unanswered , there is serious danger that the august 21 use of chemical weapons would lead to further use in this and future conflicts , posing a humanitarian threat both to those victims who would suffer these weapons ' scourge and a security threat to neighbors , others in the region , and the international community as a whole			0
" the thorny political and legal problems the president faces were on display over the weekend as some lawmakers returned to @entity0 early to receive intelligence briefings and to prepare to vote on the authorization			2
the administration 's proposed authorization for action in @entity7 is broad and open - ended , and many lawmakers emerged from briefings with deep misgivings			1
@entity173 sen. @entity172 of @entity174 said that among about 100 members present , the biggest single concern was the " very broad request for authority " that is at odds with the narrow scope of the mission the president outlined			0
@entity7 vote could have consequences for 2016 @entity186 sen. @entity185 of @entity187 , chairman of the @entity188 , on sunday told reporters he would propose a more narrowly tailored authorization			0
fears grew over the weekend that the administration 's broad proposal could lead to a wider conflict and perhaps @entity34 military strikes in @entity196 or @entity197 , because @entity196 's @entity197 - based @entity199 allies are providing support to the @entity90 regime			1
the administration official said the military authorization was written narrowly to address @entity7 but asserted it also has to take contingencies into account			1
if the @entity34 found chemical weapons were being transferred to @entity196 , and the only way to stop such a move was by striking in @entity196 , then the proposed authorization would n't prevent @entity3 from ordering such strikes			0
@entity212 , former legal adviser to the @entity213 and the @entity214 under president @entity32 , said @entity3 's international law problem is of his own making			1
" this particular president has boxed himself into a corner to distinguish himself from his predecessor , " he said			0
of @entity3 's planned @entity7 military strikes , @entity212 said , " even if it 's with the purest of motives , it makes him look hypocritical			1
" @entity225 , a @entity226 law professor , drew parallels to the @entity230 administration 's bombing against @entity232 forces to protect @entity233			1
in that case , president @entity230 ignored the fact that a proposed military force authorization was voted down in @entity61			0
@entity225 said the problem is that international law does n't necessarily take into account events like those in @entity7 or @entity233			1
in these cases the argument becomes , @entity225 said , that " it was legitimate , but illegal ( under international law )			2
it was the good thing to do because of the moral reasons			0
" some human rights groups have long pushed for international law to allow outside intervention to stop atrocities			2
the @entity34 and other nations have been reluctant to accept such a broad change , @entity212 said			0
the administration 's lawyers have been careful to guide the choice of words used by top officials			2
@entity3 and secretary of state @entity258 , who made a forceful case for military action on friday , have carefully portrayed @entity262 's actions as violating " international norms			2
" that 's in part because @entity7 is n't among the 188 countries , including the @entity34 , that signed the @entity267 , the treaty that prohibits the production and use of such weapons			2
@entity3 has long grappled with the issue of how to deal with civil war atrocities when international law does n't offer a way to stop them			1
in his december 2009 speech to accept the @entity278 , @entity3 endorsed a call for an " evolution of human institutions			0
" on one hand , he said , it is important for the @entity34 and other nations to respect international rules , saying " when we do n't , our actions appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy of future interventions , no matter how justified			0
" but then he also noted the need to " prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government , or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region			0
" @entity3 added : " i believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds , as it was in the @entity299 , or in other places that have been scarred by war			0
inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later			0
that 's why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace			0
" military has concerns about @entity7 mission			0

new : the @entity38 ' @entity37 provides the president with a preliminary legal opinion
@entity3 's plan to strike @entity7 is not legal under international law , experts say
congressional approval would lend it some legitimacy , an administration official says
lawmakers briefed on the administration 's proposal say it is too broad
