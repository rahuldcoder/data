in each project @entity1 has immersed himself in the lives of his protagonists in an attempt to comprehend the challenges of their everyday existence			1
when he filmed a displaced @entity98 family in his 2004 film , " living with refugees , " @entity1 only permitted himself to eat when they ate and drink from the same sources , mostly dried - up rivers , as he followed them across dangerous terrain from @entity112 to @entity113			1
