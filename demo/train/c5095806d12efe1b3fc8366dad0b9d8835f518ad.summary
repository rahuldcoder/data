-- @entity1 took a big step towards reaching the @entity4 final for the third time in four years as the @entity7 team ended @entity9 's 100 % home record this season in @entity12 's top club competition on tuesday			1
second - half goals from @entity14 and @entity15 gave @entity1 a 2 - 0 victory in @entity17 ahead of next wednesday 's second leg of the semifinal at @entity20			1
it could have been a much greater margin as goalkeeper @entity22 performed heroics to keep the match scoreless for more than an hour , while @entity1 's defense has yet to concede away from home in the tournament this season			1
but @entity15 set @entity14 clear with a clever pass and the 37 - year - old slipped the ball past @entity22 with his favored left foot in the 67th minute to make up for several earlier misses by the @entity34			1
@entity35 : @entity37 trip is @entity1 's toughest test @entity14 became the oldest player to score in the tournament , surpassing @entity42 's october effort against @entity43 by nearly three months			1
@entity44 striker @entity15 doubled the lead three minutes later after @entity46 nipped in front of the static @entity9 defense and slid the ball into his path			2
" we 're delighted but a bit disappointed in terms of not scoring more , " @entity15 told reporters			0
" we have done very well			0
we have to be professional for the second leg as @entity9 ca n't be taken lightly			2
they went to @entity57 and won 5 - 2 ( in the quarterfinals )			0
" @entity22 , who has announced that he will not extend his contract at @entity9 and will reportedly make a post-season move to @entity61 , had earlier shown why so many clubs -- including @entity1 -- have been linked with the 25 - year - old			1
the @entity17 international denied @entity14 twice in the first half and also saved from @entity46 , and then kept out @entity67 's header straight after the break			2
@entity14 shot embarrassingly wide with his weaker right foot after a clever turn outwitted two defenders , then @entity46 was ruled offside before putting the ball past @entity22 in the 51st minute			0
' @entity73 wants to match @entity74 after @entity1 finally went comfortably ahead , manager @entity75 was able to rest @entity46 , @entity76 and @entity15 ahead of sunday 's trip to @entity78 rivals @entity37			1
it was the 69 - year - old @entity79 's 100th away game in @entity12 as a manager , as he seeks to add to @entity4 titles in 1999 and 2008 to give @entity1 a fourth @entity84 crown overall			1
@entity1 have every incentive to reach the final , which will be played on home soil at @entity89 's @entity88 on may 28			1
however , the 18 - time @entity7 champions have never beaten a @entity92 team in four two - legged ties so far in the competition , losing to @entity61 in last season 's quarterfinals			1
" we have to recognize that we were dominated by a team playing in a different dimension , " @entity9 defender @entity97 said			2
" we still have hope , anything is possible			0
we 'll try to do everything to win at @entity20			0
" the winning team will progress for a title match against @entity107 giants @entity106 or @entity74 , who clash in the first leg of their semifinal at the @entity111 on wednesday			0
@entity1 lost 2 - 0 to @entity106 in the 2009 final in @entity113			2
meanwhile , @entity114 moved up to ninth place with a 3 - 0 win over relegation - threatened @entity117 in tuesday 's only @entity78 fixture			0
striker @entity119 opened the scoring with a header after 16 minutes , while defender @entity122 made it 2 - 0 from close range on halftime before winger @entity126 made it safe with a deflected effort soon after the interval			0
however , @entity114 winger @entity130 could miss the @entity132 final against @entity133 on may 14 after being stretchered off in the first half with a hamstring injury			0
the defeat left @entity137 second from bottom with four matches to play .			0

second - half goals from @entity14 and @entity15 give @entity1 semifinal edge
@entity9 beaten at home for first time in this season 's @entity4
@entity1 have never beaten a @entity92 team in a two - leg tie in the tournament
