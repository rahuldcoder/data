-- people who consume lots of foods rich in vitamin @entity4 -- such as fish and fortified cereals -- may be at lower risk of developing alzheimer 's disease than people who take in less of the vitamin , a small study conducted in @entity12 suggests			1
in the study , which was published in @entity15 , researchers in @entity14 analyzed blood samples from 271 individuals ages 65 to 79 who showed no evidence of dementia			0
the researchers tested for levels of a blood marker of @entity4 and for levels of homocysteine , an amino acid that has been linked to an increased risk of @entity8 ( as well as heart disease and stroke )			1
b vitamins , including @entity4 and folate , have been shown to help lower homocysteine levels , so high levels of the amino acid suggest low levels of @entity4			1
@entity0 : 9 foods that may help save your memory over the next seven years , 17 study participants were diagnosed with @entity8 's disease			1
the people with the highest levels of homocysteine at the beginning of the study had the greatest risk of developing the disease			0
in contrast , each unit increase in the marker of vitamin @entity4 ( known as holotranscobalamin ) reduced the risk of developing @entity8 's by 2 percent			1
the relationship between @entity4 and @entity8 's risk is " complex , " says dr. @entity55 , @entity56 , an associate professor of neurology at the @entity58 and the author of an editorial accompanying the study			2
but , she adds , " @entity4 levels , particularly holotranscobalamin levels , likely play a contributory role			0
" the links among @entity8 's risk , homocysteine , and @entity4 were more pronounced in older individuals , the study found			1
@entity0 : 25 signs and symptoms of @entity8 's disease blood levels of folate , which the researchers also measured , were not related to homocysteine levels or @entity8 's risk in this study			1
folic acid -- a synthetic version of folate found in many supplements and multivitamins -- has been shown to lower homocysteine in previous studies , but its effect on disease risk is disputed			2
a @entity83 panel recently concluded that there are no foods or vitamins that definitively prevent the development of alzheimer 's disease , and experts say this study is consistent with the panel 's recommendations			2
" a healthy diet likely remains important , " @entity92 says			0
" the role of supplementation remains unclear			0
" @entity0 : @entity96 does n't work : are there better ways to save your brain ? @entity101 , @entity102 , the senior director of medical and scientific relations at the @entity104 , a nonprofit research and advocacy group , urges caution in interpreting the new findings , especially given that so few study participants developed the disease			0
" we do know that vitamin @entity4 is a huge contributor to lowering homocysteine levels , " she says			2
" lowering these in general is important for cardiovascular health , and this study strengthens our knowledge about its role in risk for @entity8 's disease			1
" dr. @entity119 , @entity56 , the associate director of the @entity120 at the @entity121 , in @entity122 , says that it may make sense for people to get blood tests to measure their levels of @entity4 and folate			0
@entity0 : how to age - proof your memory however , he says , the study findings may not necessarily translate to people outside @entity14			0
and he worries that the results may spur doctors to recommend b12 injections to their patients -- a preventive treatment that he says is unfounded and already overused			0
it 's still unclear whether increasing your intake of vitamin b12 will help protect you from @entity8 's , @entity119 says			0
" good nutrition should minimize the risk of alzheimer 's disease , but we ca n't say that any specific food has been proven to reduce this risk			1

people who consume foods rich in vitamin @entity4 may be at lower risk of developing @entity8 's
b vitamins may help lower homocysteine levels , an amino acid linked to the disease
alzheimer 's disease risk could be minimized with general good nutrition
