how we 've missed her ! her music , her proto - @entity5 apparel videos , her predictably unpredictable nature			2
in her absence , we 've settled for the likes of @entity9 and @entity10 , which has been whatever			0
but thankfully , @entity12 's back this year , and to celebrate , she 's giving the world what she knows it wants : another alarmingly long album title			1
it 's 67 words shorter than than her last long - titled album , but the songstress ' new one is still a 23 - word - deep doozy			1
here it is in all its randomly capitalized glory : " @entity26 is wiser than the @entity27 , and @entity28 will serve you more than @entity30 will ever do			0
" the album , @entity12 's fourth -- and first since " 2005â € ²s @entity34 " -- does n't have a firm release date yet , though june is reportedly in the running			1
but the bigger mystery is : what do we call it ? the " @entity46 " is the obvious choice , but judging by the title 's capitalization , there are more options , including : " @entity27 , " " @entity28 , " and " ropes			1
" or you could go rogue and refer to it as " serve you more , " or even " @entity50			0
" either way , we feel sorry for the intern at @entity53 who 'll be spending her summer composing tweets with the hashtag # theidlerwheeeliswiserthanthedriverofthescrewandwhippingcords willserveyoumorethanropeswilleverdo			0
