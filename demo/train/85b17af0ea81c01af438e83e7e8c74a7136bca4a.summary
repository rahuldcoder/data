-- @entity2 and @entity3 knew each other online -- she 's read his blog , he 's seen her tweets -- before they met in person in @entity8 a few weeks ago			2
a bit awkward , they made small talk , spending an hour or so getting to know each other			2
" when i 'm with someone new , my primary bit of nervousness is i have no idea if they 'll like me , or be attracted to me , or be interested in me , " @entity2 says			2
" it 's sort of akin to a first date situation			2
" but this was n't a first date -- it was strictly business			1
after chatting , @entity2 and @entity3 got to work , which in their case meant having sex			0
@entity2 and @entity3 ( their stage names ) are adult performers			0
while hooking up with a new co-star can provoke some anxiety , there 's one thing they 're usually not anxious about : getting a sexually transmitted disease from their co-star , since both get tested for @entity39 at least once a month			1
" before you start shooting , you go online to see the other person 's test results , " @entity3 explains			1
" or sometimes on set , before you start , they show you the results on paper			0
" such diligence about @entity39 is a good idea for anyone having sex with a new partner , even if you 're not a porn star , says dr. @entity53 , director of clinical research at the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57			1
" it really shows they 're thinking conscientiously , " @entity53 says			0
" i think it really works			0
" @entity61 , which does @entity39 screenings for adult performers , routinely tests for @entity64 , chlamydia , and gonorrhea , according to @entity67 , president and ceo of the service			1
in addition , some performers opt for an additional panel of tests for hepatitis b , hepatitis c and syphilis			0
so far , @entity2 and @entity3 say it 's worked for them			0
@entity2 says in her eight years as an adult performer -- she has about five sexual partners a month professionally -- she has n't contracted a single std. she says when she has sex with men outside work she always uses a condom			1
@entity3 says about once a year he comes down with a case of chlamydia or gonorrhea			0
" i take some pills and it goes away in a week , " he says , adding that outside of work he has sex only with other performers , since he 's knows they 're regularly tested			1
while the testing is n't foolproof , it lowers the risk of getting infected			1
combine that with condom use and the risk goes down even more			1
@entity64 is a particularly tricky test , since it may provide a false negative if taken too soon after a person is exposed to @entity64			1
this is because most people do n't produce enough antibodies for the test to detect until around a month after being exposed			1
some people take three months or longer to produce detectable antibodies			0
" i think about this all the time , " says @entity2 , who 's been an adult performer for eight years			0
" it 's by far the biggest risk in the industry			2
i think the one thing that gives me comfort -- small comfort -- is that the people i 'm working with by and large have very strong safer sex practices because of what they do for a living			0
" @entity3 says he 's not too concerned about contracting @entity64 since he has sex only with women , but he adds that he knows he 's taking at least a small risk			1
" there 's risk in a lot of jobs , " he says			2
" professional athletes take risks			0
" when beginning a new relationship , many wonder what diseases they should get tested for			2
" it 's a very common question , for both males and females , " @entity53 says			0
neither the @entity133 , nor the @entity134 has a list of @entity39 you should get tested for when you 're about to have sex for the first time with someone			1
however , after discussion with various @entity39 experts , here 's a list of tests many doctors recommend			1
they can be a starting point for a discussion with your doctor			0
the @entity133 has a list of clinics that offer testing for @entity39 by zip code			1
@entity155 often a simple urine test is all that is necessary ; sometimes a swab must be taken from the infected area , according to @entity134			1
many people do n't know they have chlamydia , the most frequently reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the @entity162			2
complications among men are rare , but in women chlamydia can lead to chronic pelvic pain , infertility , and ectopic pregnancies			0
the disease can be easily treated and cured with antibiotics , according to the @entity133			0
gonorrhea this is also often a urine test , although sometimes a swab is taken from the infected area , @entity134 says			1
some men have no symptoms of gonorrhea , while others have painful urination or discharge from the penis , according to the @entity133			0
antibiotics can treat the disease , but if left untreated , gonorrhea can lead to infertility in men and women , and can be life - threatening if it spreads to the blood or joints			0
syphilis a blood test is used to diagnose syphilis , a disease that 's easy to treat in its early stages , but if left untreated can cause blindness or even death , according to the @entity133			2
@entity199 and @entity200 men who have sex with men should talk to their doctor about getting tested for @entity199 and @entity200 , and they should also be vaccinated against the diseases , says dr. @entity206 , a clinical professor of medicine at the @entity208 for @entity209 and @entity39 @entity64 as noted above , you can be positive for @entity64 for several weeks or months before it will show up on most @entity64 blood tests			1
a note about herpes about one out of six people ages 14 through 49 have genital herpes simplex virus type 2 , according to the @entity133			0
testing is controversial since the results are not always accurate or helpful			2
dr. @entity218 , associate professor of anthropology and medicine at @entity221 in @entity222 , @entity223 , and a spokesperson for @entity134 , says the best strategy might be to get tested if you have recurrent lesions that could be herpes , or if you 're starting a new relationship with someone who has herpes , since drugs can be given to your infected partner to decrease the chances you 'll get the disease , too			1
" other than that , i probably would not screen for herpes -- the waters are just too murky , " @entity218 says .			0
