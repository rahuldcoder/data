-- the launch of the first @entity4 - backed @entity3 tablets is drawing near			1
flashing another sign of the new software 's imminence , @entity4 has posted an updated version of its development kit			2
this new set of tools for application developers works with the upcoming @entity3 3.0 operating system			1
@entity3 was designed with smartphones in mind			2
android 3.0 , also called @entity16 , is the first version from @entity4 geared toward tablet computers			2
the first fruit of that work will come late in february , when @entity21 releases the @entity22 , which works on @entity24 ' network			1
later , @entity25 and @entity26 will debut the @entity27			0
@entity4 's hardware partners have taken shots at molding @entity3 to fit larger screens			1
for example , @entity31 did so for its @entity33 , a 7 - inch touch - screen tablet			2
but these types of products have been criticized for taking baby steps , rather than creating a system tailored entirely for tablets			0
the @entity40 tablets have also struggled to attract many app makers willing to retool programs for the larger screens , despite @entity31 selling a million of them in two months			0
@entity4 is expected to have better luck with its official foray into tablets			0
not long after releasing the @entity3 3.0 development kit , blogs and message boards devoted to @entity3 apps were digging through documentation and beginning to experiment with code			1
the package provides a closer look at some of the tablet 's primary apps			0
the web browser looks like @entity4 's @entity60 computer program , with tabbed browsing abilities , and integrates tightly with that desktop software for synchronizing things like bookmarks			0
the camera app has a wheel on the side for toggling effects			0
to help developers build new apps , @entity4 also details how the new @entity3 handles multi-tasking and notifications			1
@entity4 's developer information also goes in depth on how people will navigate on a tablet with no physical buttons -- using what 's called a @entity79 , a sliver displayed at the bottom for accessing the home screen and navigation controls , as well as an @entity84 at the top , which changes depending on the app being used			1
developers have about a month to get apps ready to meet the demand that may come from the @entity22 's anticipated release			1
but it 's not just about software that works on bigger screens			0
app makers will be able to tap features not present in any other tablet or phone , such as the barometer sensor installed in @entity21 's upcoming tablet .			0

the launch of the @entity22 tablet from @entity103 is *scheduled* for late february
@entity4 began asking developers to start testing apps for the tablet - *optimized* @entity3
the new documentation details how a *gadget* with no physical buttons will work
