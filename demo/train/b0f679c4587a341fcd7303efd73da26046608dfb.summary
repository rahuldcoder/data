@entity0 -- a @entity3 appeals court on wednesday rejected a @entity5 request to extradite the widow of former @entity5 president @entity7 , whose assassination sparked the 1994 genocide			1
lawyer @entity10 said his client , former first lady @entity11 , was " relieved " and " very satisfied " with the court 's decision			1
" this is a very delicate case , as it can also impact relations between @entity17 and @entity5 , so this decision is important and in many ways symbolic , " @entity10 said			1
@entity7 still faces a civil suit dating from 2007 , when a @entity3 @entity5 rights collective accused her of being involved in the genocide , @entity10 said			1
@entity7 has asked to be heard by a judge but is still waiting to be summoned , he said			2
she faces a @entity5 warrant on genocide charges that include crimes against humanity , specifically murder and extermination ; creation of a criminal gang , namely the @entity36 militias ; and aiding and abetting the killings perpetrated by soldiers in violation of the @entity40 , @entity25 , the head of @entity5 's @entity26 , said last year			1
