-- fifteen songs on one record ? it 's a bold move â € ” more potential hits , but more potential misses , too			1
hard - rockin ' @entity8 native @entity7 , who prides himself on not fitting in a square country box , did it on his 2010 crossover monster , " @entity10 , " and scored three no. 1s , including the rap - laden '' @entity12 '' and the @entity14 duet '' @entity6			1
'' on " @entity18 , " his fifth album , he aims high and wide again with tracks ranging from '' 1994 , '' a hip - hoppy tribute to ' 90s country artist @entity20 that asks you to chant '' @entity20 ! @entity20 ! @entity23 ! '' ( laugh , but then , ugh , you will ) , to '' @entity25 , '' the ballad of a sad stripper who dulls her pain with cheap sex and cocaine			1
' @entity32 ' : huge premiere ratings while @entity7 can pull off his wilder detours , he 's at his best when he hews to traditional themes			2
there 's an urgency in his voice that gives every driving chorus added heat , whether he 's singing about a woman ( '' i do n't do lonely well , '' '' @entity45 '' ) , his country - boy work ethic ( '' @entity47 , '' with @entity48 and @entity49 ) , or a water tower ( literally , '' @entity51 '' )			2
and man , does he know how to turn a simple date - night drive into something epic			0
when he pleads , '' i do n't want to waste that moon / and the heat on the hood of this @entity60 '' on the parkin ' ballad '' talk , '' well , you may not want to waste it either			0
