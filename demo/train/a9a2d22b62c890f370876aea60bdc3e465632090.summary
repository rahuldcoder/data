the death of 17 - year - old @entity1 was awful enough for his parents			1
then came the doubts about investigators ' conclusion that it was an accident			0
but the discovery that their son 's body and skull had been stuffed with newspaper before burial added a horrific new dimension to their anguish and further fueled their skepticism of the official findings			2
" we have been let down again , " his father , @entity19 , told @entity20			0
" when we buried @entity1 , we thought we were burying @entity1 , not half of @entity1			1
" @entity1 was found dead in a gym at @entity24 in january			1
state medical examiners concluded that the three - sport athlete suffocated after getting stuck in a rolled - up gym mat while reaching for a sneaker			1
@entity31 was not accidental , family 's autopsy finds his parents , @entity33 and @entity34 , never have bought that explanation			1
they won a court order to have their son 's body exhumed and a second autopsy performed in june			2
during an autopsy , internal organs are removed and examined before being returned for burial			1
but when dr. @entity44 , the private pathologist who conducted the second autopsy , opened up the teen 's remains , the brain , heart , lungs , liver and other viscera were missing			2
every organ from the pelvis to the skull was gone			0
" i 'm not sure at this point who did not return the organs to the body , " @entity44 said			0
" but i know when we got the body , the organs were not there			0
" two entities had custody of @entity1 's body after his death -- the @entity67 , which conducted the first autopsy in january ; and the @entity69 in @entity70 , which handled the teen 's embalming and burial			1
@entity67 spokeswoman @entity77 told @entity20 that after the autopsy , " the organs were placed in @entity1 's body , the body was closed , then the body was released to the funeral home			1
" that 's normal practice , @entity81 said			0
the funeral home would not comment to @entity20			0
but in a letter to the @entity88 ' attorney , funeral home owner @entity85 said his firm never received the teen 's organs			1
@entity85 wrote that the organs " were destroyed through natural process " due to the position of @entity1 's body when he died , and " discarded by the prosector before the body was sent back to @entity70			1
" a prosector dissects the body for pathological examination			0
scene points to foul play stuffing a body with old newsprint and department - store circulars -- " like he was a garbage can , " as @entity34 put it -- is n't exactly standard practice in forensic pathology or the mortician 's trade			2
@entity110 , the founder of a @entity112 embalming school , called it " not consistent with the standards of care " in the industry			0
and dr. @entity117 , the president of the @entity118 , told @entity20 , " i have never heard of this practice			0
" organs are typically placed in plastic bag , which is then put back into the body cavity after an autopsy , @entity117 told @entity20 in an e-mail			2
while individual organs may be kept back for further testing , he wrote , " this would not amount to all of the organs in any circumstance that i can imagine			0
" funeral homes are licensed by the @entity134 secretary of state 's office , which has opened an investigation into how @entity1 's body was treated , said @entity137 , a spokesman for the agency			2
@entity44 , who was hired by the @entity1 family for a second autopsy , found @entity1 had sustained a blow to the right side of his neck that was " consistent with inflicted injury			1
" challenging the state autopsy 's finding of positional asphyxiation , he concluded the teen died as the result of " unexplained , apparent non-accidental , blunt force trauma			2
" and death scene imagery obtained exclusively by @entity20 has led a former @entity153 agent to question how @entity1 died : " i think this young man met with foul play , " said @entity156 , now an @entity157 private investigator			1
@entity24 sheriff @entity158 refused to discuss the matter with @entity20 , calling @entity1 's death a closed case			1
the @entity162 announced in september that it would n't open a civil rights investigation into the case			0
but federal prosecutors in south @entity134 have met with the family 's representatives and are weighing whether to open their own probe , said @entity168 , the @entity169 attorney whose district includes @entity70			0
" this is about getting to the facts and the truth , and we want the @entity1 family and the community of @entity70 to have confidence in the process , " @entity168 said			2
" i am cognizant of time , and we continue to move the process along			0
" @entity168 urged anyone with information about @entity1 's death to contact his office			1
@entity1 's parents have come to believe their son 's death was no accident , and the macabre discovery about their son 's body has only deepened that belief			1
" it 's unbearable , just about , " @entity34 said			0
" the only thing that wakes you up in the morning is to just keep pushing			0
