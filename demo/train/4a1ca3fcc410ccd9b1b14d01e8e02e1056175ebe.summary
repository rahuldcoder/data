-- @entity2 prime minister @entity1 will make the call at the @entity4 in @entity5 for international action to curb the activities of tax havens , which campaigners say cost governments trillions in lost revenues			1
journalist @entity12 points out what he calls the hypocrisy of the @entity2 's position , itself sitting at the center of the world 's most powerful offshore empire			1
walking up @entity20 's strand in the direction of @entity22 does not feel like crossing one of the major financial fault lines in the global economy			0
few tourists would perhaps even notice the stone dragon stranded between buses in the @entity29 that marks the boundary of the @entity32 , the @entity2 capital 's financial district and one of global capitalism 's most dynamic engines			1
yet to step into the @entity32 is to enter what has been described by @entity38 , author of " @entity39 : @entity40 and the @entity41 , " as " an offshore island inside @entity2			1
" @entity2 's role at the center of an empire of tax havens is under scrutiny this week , ironically , because @entity2 prime minister @entity1 has made tax evasion the central theme of this week 's @entity4 meeting in @entity5			1
" tax evasion and avoidance are issues whose time has come			0
after years of abuse people across the planet are rightly calling for action , " says a @entity2 government briefing released ahead of the summit			1
@entity1 's initiative has thrust the spotlight on the @entity2 's overseas territories and crown dependencies , an odd collection of colonial offcuts including the @entity66 , the @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			1
all are considered offshore hubs , and all benefit from close ties to the @entity2 finance industry , pouring money into the @entity32			1
on saturday , @entity1 announced that 10 territories and dependencies had agreed to sign up to an existing convention on corporate transparency promoted by the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) , saying : " it is important we are getting our house in order			2
" but campaigners , such as the @entity87 's @entity86 , remain skeptical whether @entity1 can accomplish anything that will meaningfully challenge the power of the tax havens			1
he says measures such as greater transparency in company ownership , though welcome and necessary , do not go far enough in opening up other offshore structures , including trusts , to scrutiny			0
@entity2 is far from alone among @entity4 countries in the promotion and provision of offshore - style facilities			1
the @entity101 provides parallel structures offering low taxes and corporate secrecy with the @entity105 reporting last year on how legitimate businesses and criminal enterprises were flocking to @entity108 " in hopes of minimizing taxes , skirting regulations , plying friendly courts or , when needed , covering their tracks			0
" @entity114 and several @entity116 countries also featured on the last @entity117 , published in 2011 and topped by @entity118			0
of the @entity2 though , the index said : " if the entire @entity2 network of secrecy jurisdictions were considered , it would easily be ranked number one			2
" legal tax avoidance , which involves shifting profits to jurisdictions that do not levy corporate tax via offshore subsidiaries , and tax evasion , its criminal cousin , have long been among the perks of wealth			2
as @entity132 , the @entity133 hotelier and so - called " @entity132 , " is quoted as saying : " we do n't pay taxes			0
only the little people pay taxes			0
" @entity132 , who was convicted of tax evasion , denied having said this , but the words followed her for the rest of her life			0
yet the consequences of this industry are borne by those who can least afford it			0
aid charity @entity147 estimated last month that almost half of all investment into developing countries was funneled through tax havens ; this means the profits from that investment remain offshore , depriving the world 's poorest countries of much - needed revenues			1
it cited one transaction alone conducted through @entity2 - linked havens that would have netted the @entity160 government $ 2.2 billion in tax ; enough to provide a lunchtime meal to every @entity160 primary schoolchild for a year			1
a report last month by @entity166 's @entity165 highlighted mining deals in the @entity168 which had cost the country an estimated $ 1.36 billion in revenues , enough to double the country 's health and education budgets			2
yet attempting to estimate exactly how much money is concealed offshore is largely futile , with most experts willing to venture only that the figure runs into many trillions			0
an investigation last year conducted for the @entity87 estimated that $ 21 to $ 32 trillion was hidden offshore by super-rich individuals alone			0
campaigners such as @entity87 's @entity86 are skeptical whether the @entity4 can accomplish anything that will meaningfully challenge the power of the tax havens			1
he says proposed measures , though welcome and necessary such as greater transparency in company ownership , do not go far enough in opening up other offshore structures , including trusts , to scrutiny			0
history also suggests the @entity32 and its allies will defend their own interests			0
the @entity32 's origins are lost in the distant past , with the corporation 's own website describing the area as " a prime location for trade since before @entity200			0
" its tradition of self - governance predates the consolidation of the modern @entity2 state , and the @entity32 's powerbrokers have fiercely defended their ancient privileges ever since , using their role as lenders to crown and government as leverage			1
should @entity212 , the @entity2 's head of state , feel the urge to cross the @entity32 's boundaries to visit the @entity215 on @entity216 for a low - tax latte , ceremony dictates that she should still seek the permission of the @entity32 's lord mayor to do so			1
( @entity215 in december 2012 offered to pay additional taxes in the @entity2 in response to public pressure there to collect more taxes from multinational companies			2
) and since 1571 , an official known as the @entity227 has maintained a seat in the @entity229 to protect and promote the @entity32 's interests in parliament , even as a turbo - charged 21st century financial infrastructure has been bolted onto this medieval statelet			2
but the use of the offshore sector has long been virtually endemic among a wealthy elite in the @entity2 , even beyond the @entity32 's boundaries			1
@entity2 governments once attempted to curb the power and independence of the financial sector , hamstrung only by their borrowing dependency on the same source			1
yet since the 1980s , the era of @entity245 's so - called " @entity244 " of markets deregulation , governments have enjoyed a cosier relationship with corporate finance , summed up by @entity249 , a close ally of @entity250 , who once said the once - socialist @entity251 was " intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich			2
" the rest of that quote -- " ... as long as they pay their taxes " -- is less well remembered			0
in 2011 , @entity1 's coalition passed legislation exempting @entity2 - based corporations from income tax on overseas earnings ; a move described by commentator @entity263 as a " corporate coup d'etat			1
" research published by @entity147 showed that 98 out of 100 companies on the @entity267 used offshore subsidiaries , with more registered in @entity69 and the @entity66 than in @entity160 and @entity269			0
and it has long been a rite of passage for newly - minted @entity2 , from @entity272 drivers to musicians to self - made millionaires , to shift their riches to @entity118 , @entity276 or @entity69 with the public raising little more than an eyebrow in reproach			1
research by the @entity282 newspaper last year revealed how @entity1 's own father had built a considerable family fortune by running a legal network of offshore investment funds			1
@entity1 and other members of his family declined to comment on the report			2
yet that situation may be changing , with campaign groups such as @entity292 stirring up populist anger against corporate tax avoidance and politicians now scrambling to get on the bandwagon , while celebrity tax - dodging schemes have joined sex and drugs scandals as tabloid staples			2
recent exposure of the legal tax avoidance strategies of @entity303 and @entity304 saw executives from both companies summoned for scrutiny by the @entity2 's parliamentary public accounts committee where lawmaker @entity309 told @entity303 vice president @entity310 : " you are a company that says you do no evil			1
and i think that you do do evil			0
" in the @entity101 , meanwhile , @entity317 ceo @entity316 was summoned to appear on @entity318 after a @entity320 investigation found the company paid taxes in the @entity101 of 2 % on worldwide income of $ 74 billion			0
accusing the head of one of the world 's biggest companies of " exploiting an absurdity , " committee chairman sen. @entity324 made the connection between tax avoidance and efforts to cut the @entity101 deficit , and delivered a message that ought to resonate with taxpayers anywhere in the world			0
" because of those cuts , children across the country wo n't get early education			0
@entity342 seniors will go without meals			0
fighter jets sit idle on tarmacs because our military lacks the funding to keep pilots trained , " said @entity324			0
" the question each of us should ask today is this : should n't we close unjustified tax loopholes , and dedicate the revenue to educating our children , protecting our nation and building its future ? " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity12 .			2

at the @entity4 , @entity1 will call for action to curb activities of tax havens
@entity12 points out the hypocrisy of the @entity2 's position considering its offshore hubs
@entity2 is not the only @entity4 country promoting offshore - style facilities , says @entity12
