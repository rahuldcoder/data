@entity1 , @entity0 -- as rail travel grows ever more popular in @entity0 , the country 's most important rail station is undergoing a bold transformation to keep up with increasing demand			1
the @entity0 are among the world 's top train travelers , second only to the @entity10			2
last year , the average @entity0 person traveled about 2,000 miles by rail ; most of those journeys happened during the morning or evening rush hour			1
passenger flows have increased by 30 % over the last seven years and 350,000 people now use @entity1 's central train station every day			1
" you can say the @entity0 are train addicts , " says @entity18 , of @entity19			0
he adds : " within the last seven years we had a big increase of passengers using the trains in @entity0 and here in @entity1 as well and we need more capacity on the rails and on our trains			1
so we are building now the cross-city link			2
" the cross-city link ensures bigger capacity and shorter time of traveling			2
" more video : how @entity0 trains run like clockwork when finished , @entity1 's cross-city railway line will be over six miles long and will form an integral part of the @entity0 network 's inter-city axis			1
it is @entity0 's biggest urban project			1
at its heart is the new underground " through " station -- or " @entity45 " -- built beneath the main station			0
here , two new platforms will serve four tracks that will eventually be connected to the main train station			2
over the past four years men and machines have been digging under two rivers and a fully functioning rail hub , creating a hole the size of two football fields			0
" it 's the most challenging job you can imagine , " says project director @entity57			0
" it 's not only railways ... almost every section of engineering is realized here : we have tunneling , we have open cuts , we have deep borings			0
" @entity57 says between 500 and 700 people are working on the project at any time , building below ground while the old station continues to function above			0
@entity19 reps say that while work on the cross-city link continues full bore , 98.5 % of passengers still reach their destination on time			0
it 's estimated that as many as half a million people will use the station each day by 2020			0
that 's why the cross-city link is crucial : once completed , in 2014 , it will match that increase by doubling the capacity of the station .			1

last year , the average @entity0 person traveled about 2,000 miles by rail
each day 350,000 people use @entity1 's central train station
@entity1 's new cross-city rail link is @entity0 's biggest urban project
cross-city link could double the station 's capacity
