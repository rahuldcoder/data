@entity0 -- @entity2 ca n't forget the date : april 16 , 1993			1
as fighting raged between @entity6 and @entity7 in the central @entity9 town of @entity10 , he saw the execution of a @entity7 police chief -- the father of a classmate			1
" i saw him get on his knees , begging for his life , and they shot him point blank , " he said			2
" some people were cheering			1
" now , another date will burn bright in @entity2 's mind : may 26 , 2011 , the day @entity23 army commander @entity22 was arrested after eluding capture for more than 15 years			1
@entity22 , the highest - ranking war crimes suspect who was still at large from the @entity28 wars of the 1990s , is wanted on charges including genocide , extermination and murder by the @entity33 for the former @entity34			1
for the @entity9 victims of that war , @entity22 's arrest provided some sense of closure , just as many of the loved ones of those who perished in the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks sighed in relief at the news of @entity46 's death			1
but the television repeats of images of @entity22 and of events that took place during the war could also act as a trigger and make people relive their trauma , said psychologist @entity54 , director of the @entity55 at the @entity56 in @entity57 , which has a large @entity9 refugee community			1
" it 's a double - edged sword , " @entity54 said			1
" but in the long term , it 's good news			1
i do think it does relieve some anxieties that he would never be found			2
" @entity2 , 32 , who fled the war with his family to restart life in @entity0 , was elated by the news of @entity22 's arrest			1
" until we clear our history , we can not move , " he said			1
in another part of @entity0 , @entity73 was hard at work at her bakery , churning out dough for tandoori naan			2
she had gone to work before sunrise and had not heard the news			1
" oh , my @entity82 , " she said , pausing for a few seconds			2
" i have chills right now			2
this is very good news			1
" before the @entity86 , @entity85 worked in @entity87 but returned to her native @entity9 in the early 1990s			2
she was reluctant to speak of the brutality she witnessed , of the family she lost			2
she said she felt relief that @entity22 , whom she blamed for much of what she had suffered , was finally caught			1
she hopes he will be hanged like @entity97 , but in public , where his victims can watch			1
@entity101 , whose family runs @entity103 , a @entity9 eatery in suburban @entity0 , said the conflict was indescribable			2
like the victims of the tornado this week in @entity107 who were at a loss for words , the 55 - year - old @entity101 said it was impossible to speak about what she had seen , especially in @entity113 , a second language			1
" you have to be there and see how it is , " she said			2
she was glad @entity22 will finally face justice but said things will never be the same in @entity9			1
" you ca n't bring back all the people they killed , from all sides , " she said			1
@entity124 , 33 , a @entity9 muslim from @entity126 , @entity127 , sipped coffee outside @entity129 and described a life of " slave labor " under @entity23 rule during his teen years , performing dirty jobs like cleaning streets , loading trucks , cutting trees and digging channels at the whim of the ruling forces			2
one haunting memory typifies the humiliation : a @entity23 soldier made him repeatedly get up on and jump down from a trailer and put a gun to his head			2
" it was hell , " he said , " seven days a week			0
" another @entity9 muslim -- @entity150 , 49 , of @entity126 , @entity127 -- said he lived about 45 days under @entity23 rule before he escaped to a @entity9 - controlled region			0
he remembers stiff curfews and the killing of one man who broke them			0
also , he recalls the scarce availability of food			0
" we were really scared , " he said			0
eventually , he joined the @entity9 military -- more of a militia than an army -- thwarted persistent @entity23 assaults and found a safe place for his family in @entity9 territory			0
@entity150 said many @entity9 returned home after the warfare , but he could n't go back to his house because it burned			0
eventually , he and his family made their way to the @entity172			0
as for @entity22 , @entity150 said , the arrest was " too late			1
" unlike his countrymen who fought , fled for their lives , nursed war injuries and died , @entity22 " enjoyed his life for 15 years			1
" @entity22 's arrest can not erase the mistrust embedded deeply in @entity9 hearts , said @entity181 , who was only 12 when he witnessed war 's horrors			1
the men in his hometown of @entity186 were rounded up to be taken to concentration camps			0
his father escaped to the mountains , where he hid for four months			1
@entity181 , 31 , used to have @entity23 friends in school , but he was segregated from them before the war started			1
later , they brought guns and knives to school , intending to turn them on their former buddies			0
now , the @entity201 , @entity202 , resident sometimes hears from those former classmates on @entity204			0
but he ca n't bring himself to accept their offer to be friends			0
he does n't trust them			0
@entity209 was one of the themes sounded by @entity23 president @entity212 as he announced @entity22 's arrest			1
but @entity181 , the spokesman for the @entity214 of @entity215 @entity9 , was skeptical			0
" i think it is one of the steps , " he said			0
" but we have to keep in mind that this can not end here			0
just because they arrested ( former @entity227 leader @entity226 ) @entity225 and @entity22 , it does not absolve @entity228 of responsibility for the campaign that was led by thousands of soldiers			1
" the @entity232 , said @entity181 , accepted responsibility for the @entity234			0
there are many @entity228 , he said , who will still deny that ethnic cleansing took place in @entity9			0
the 1992 - 95 @entity9 war was the longest of the conflicts that erupted after the disintegration of communist @entity34 in the early 1990s			1
backed by the government of @entity245 , @entity227 forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a bloody campaign against the @entity7 and @entity250 populations			0
@entity22 stands accused of leading the two - year siege of the city of @entity253 that killed thousands and later , the systematic extermination of about 8,000 @entity7 in @entity256 , now remembered as the worst atrocity in @entity258 since @entity259 @entity261 's father and brother were killed by @entity22 's soldiers			1
their bodies were found in mass graves			0
he traveled for seven days and nights with his mother and surviving brother to escape @entity256 's atrocities , and he , like @entity181 , made a new life in @entity201			1
he has waited many years for the perpetrators of the @entity256 massacre to come to justice			0
" they need to get every one of them , " he said			0
@entity22 's arrest was huge for @entity261 , 32			1
the entire world was watching the arrest of the man who destroyed his family			1
@entity281 , 40 , a @entity9 muslim from @entity283 , @entity127 , lived through the worst of days in @entity253 , the @entity9 capital besieged by @entity23 forces			0
a member of @entity9 's fledgling armed forces , he was wounded twice and said " you had to defend your home			1
if not , you 'd probably be killed			0
" he recalls two particularly horrid events in @entity253 : snipers killing a group of kids on a cherry tree and a market bombing that killed about 70 people			1
the violence hardened him , and he mourned deeply when his good friend in the army died , but as more deaths piled up , he stopped crying			2
the violence and the incremental " psychological killing " ground down a dispirited populace			0
" no food , no water , no shampoo , limited everything , " he said			0
" it 's the worst thing for everybody			2
" " i do n't think the people will ever forget			2
i 'll not forget that war			2
" sitting outside the @entity103 coffee shop and grocery store during his lunch break , @entity281 sported national pride on his t - shirt , which commemorates a soccer game last decade between a @entity319 and a @entity321 team			0
" i never gave up on my country , " said @entity281			0
@entity281 has paid visits to @entity9 since he moved away but said he 'd be an " enemy " to his children if he chose to take his family back to live in the homeland			0
perhaps , he said , he 'll go back " to be buried			0
" @entity124 said he 's debating whether to discuss the past with his @entity215 children			2
he has never returned home			0
for @entity124 and many other @entity9 , the scars will never go away .			0

@entity22 's arrest is good news for war victims
but for some , it triggers memories of suffering
@entity2 saw the execution of a classmate 's father
he says @entity22 's arrest will help people move forward
