-- @entity1 is looking forward to the biggest challenge of his career after being named as @entity5 's new team captain for the @entity6			1
the 44 - year - old @entity7 takes over from @entity8 , having been one of the @entity11 's vice-captains as @entity5 regained golf 's most prestigious prize from the the @entity14 in october			1
he has a rich playing record in the biennial event , having been a winner on three occasions in seven appearances since his debut in 1987			0
" the @entity21 is welded in my heart			2
i do have wonderful memories			0
it has meant so much to me , " @entity1 told reporters at his unveiling in @entity26 on tuesday			2
" it 's a huge responsibility to be the next captain , and it 's i think one of the biggest challenges , if not the biggest challenge , i will have in my career , especially at this time of my career			0
" @entity1 is a two - time major winner having triumphed at the @entity36 in 1994 and 1999 , and he is eighth on the @entity38 's all - time list with 23 victories , but he has battled ill health in recent years			1
his last @entity21 appearance was a winning one in @entity43 in 2006 , though he played only three events last year as he continued his fight against rheumatism -- a factor that had forced him to play down reports that he would become @entity5 's captain			1
" that was the main concern			0
regarding that , the last couple of months , since i played @entity52 last year , i felt a noticeable improvement in my health condition , " @entity1 said			1
" there should be no problem			0
i 'm feeling much better and that 's the reason why i said yes			0
" while @entity8 said following the epic final - match victory at @entity60 in @entity61 that he expected changes to the team selection policy , @entity1 does not intend to make any drastic moves ahead of the qualification period starting in september			1
the @entity14 team allows for four captain 's picks to be made outside the eight places on offer through rankings points , but @entity1 said he was considering asking to reduce his wildcard selection from three to two for the trip to @entity74			1
" the more picks you get , well , the less value i think you give to the players that finish from eight to 10 , and i think to finish in the top 10 you have to play great golf , and it was proven the last time , " he said			0
@entity82 clinches @entity21 for @entity5 " and to make the top 10 , five through the world rankings and four through the @entity38 rankings , you need to have an extremely great year			1
and it would be a shame to tell any of those guys , you 're not in			0
" former @entity21 star @entity90 , who heads the @entity91 , said @entity1 had been a unanimous choice			2
" speaking to players on tour and speaking to committee members , it was probably the easiest decision i 've ever have to make for @entity21 captain , " the @entity93 told reporters			1
" we normally do it at a committee meeting			0
but there was a general feeling from the whole membership that @entity1 needed to be the next captain			2
we did n't feel that we needed to sit in a committee meeting and discuss this , because it was the one man that everybody on this tour wanted to be captain			0

@entity38 members choose @entity1 as @entity21 captain
@entity7 was vice-captain in last year 's winning team and has played seven times
the 44 - year - old says he is winning his battle against ill health that has *hampered* him
he is considering reducing captain 's wildcard picks from three to two
