@entity0 -- the @entity2 sided with @entity3 on thursday in the high - stakes power struggle over presidential recess appointments , in which officials are placed in top government jobs temporarily without @entity9 approval			1
the justices ' unanimous ruling on the narrowest of grounds against the @entity15 administration could invalidate hundreds of decisions by the @entity17 , the federal agency at the center of this legal fight			1
at issue is whether three people named by president @entity15 to the board were ineligible to serve because their appointments were made while the @entity9 was technically in a " pro forma " session during the 2011 - 12 winter holiday break			1
that meant the mostly empty chamber was convening every three days without any business conducted , and with the sessions lasting only minutes at most			0
the court majority concluded recess appointments would be valid if those breaks lasted 10 days or more			1
the @entity33 allows a president to fill temporary appointments during a recess , without congressional approval			1
but more recently , lawmakers have sought to thwart certain appointments by never technically shutting down the @entity9			1
the closely watched constitutional and political confrontation over the practice has accelerated because of partisan gridlock in @entity3			0
presidential spokesman @entity43 told reporters on @entity45 that the @entity46 was " deeply disappointed " in the decision and said the administration is " still reviewing it			0
" the court 's opinion will not have an immediate effect , since @entity53 controlling the @entity9 imposed rules making it harder for @entity55 to block @entity15 's nominees			1
but a change in @entity9 control after november 's midterm elections could renew the disagreements			2
" we conclude that the @entity63 does not give the president the constitutional authority to make the appointments here at issue , " justice @entity61 said			0
" we hold that the @entity9 is in session , and not in recess , when the @entity9 says that it is in session			1
" but the court said the executive could use his power to make recess appointments even when the vacancy occurred before the @entity9 goes on break			1
to achieve unanimity , the court took a limited approach , avoiding a decision that could have applied to greater set of recess scenarios , thereby further blunting the executive 's power			0
four conservative justices wanted their colleagues to go farther , and complained the majority " bends over backwards " to preserve some of the president 's options			0
that gives both branches some room to claim even a partial victory			0
@entity9 officials weigh in " i welcome the @entity2 's important decision today , " senate minority leader @entity96 , @entity97 , said just after the ruling			1
" this administration has a tendency to abide by laws that it likes and to disregard those it does n't			0
" his @entity53 counterpart blamed the @entity55 for the current fights			0
" since president @entity15 took office , @entity9 @entity55 have done everything possible to deny qualified nominees from receiving a fair up - or - down vote , " said senate majority leader @entity108 , @entity109			2
" president @entity15 did the right thing when he made these appointments on behalf of @entity118 workers			0
" while agreeing with the outcome of the narrow question presented , four more conservative justices worried that the ruling would allow the president to retain a good deal of the " powerful weapon " of making recess appointments			1
" the only remaining practical use for the recess - appointment power is the ignoble one of enabling presidents to circumvent the @entity9 's role in the appointment process , which is precisely what happened here , " justice @entity126 said from the bench			1
other presidents ' recess appointments among recent presidents , @entity138 made 240 recess appointments , @entity141 made 77 , @entity137 made 139 , @entity142 made 171 , and @entity15 has made 32 so far			2
gen. ( later president ) @entity145 , judge ( later justice ) @entity143 , chief justice @entity147 and @entity149 chairman @entity148 were all recess appointments			2
some @entity55 lawmakers also accused the president of flip - flopping on the issue			0
when he was a senator , @entity15 criticized then - president @entity141 's recess appointment of @entity156 as @entity118 ambassador to the @entity158			0
the court 's ruling could also put in jeopardy some decisions made by @entity164 , who was appointed to head the @entity165 , a move also being challenged in a separate lawsuit			2
@entity164 was named the same day as the three @entity17 appointments , which gave the board a full panel for the first time in a year			1
the lawsuit leading the to the @entity2 case was brought by @entity173 , a family - owned @entity174 , @entity0 , bottling company , which complained the board improperly ruled in favor of @entity179 during contract negotiations			0
company executives said the board lacked a binding quorum because the recess appointments made by @entity15 were not legal			2
how they 've kept the @entity9 in session since may 2011 , republicans have been relying on a little - known procedure to keep the @entity9 in session , even when it was not really conducting any business , in order to stop the president from making those recess appointments			1
the legal basis comes from a 1993 @entity195 brief saying the president should act only if the @entity9 is in official recess more than three days			1
so , party leaders have arranged for a single @entity55 lawmaker to show up every three days and gavel the @entity9 to order , wait around for about 30 seconds , gavel it to a close , then leave			2
legal experts have disagreed on both the tactical and timing procedures by the @entity9 , and whether the president has unilateral authority to override those legislative tactics			0
the case is @entity17 v. @entity173 ( 12 - 1281 )			0
@entity209 plans lawsuit against @entity15 over executive orders			0

unanimous ruling could invalidate hundreds of @entity17 decisions
@entity33 allows temporary appointments during a recess , without congressional approval
lawmakers have sought to stop appointments by technically never shutting down the @entity9
