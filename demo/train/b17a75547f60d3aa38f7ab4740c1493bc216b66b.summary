the coolest new trading cards feature a " @entity3			2
" for the last 52 weeks , artist @entity4 has been interviewing one geek hero a week , posting podcasts of his discussions online and designing the front and back of a trading card			1
( @entity10 write the descriptions			0
) this week , nerdy retailer @entity12 debuts physical , collectible " @entity3 " cards			1
the first installment features the first eight geeks in @entity4 's project			1
the cards show a picture on the front of a celebrity in the geek world , stylized as an iconic character from sci - fi or fantasy			1
the backs offer a description of the characterized geek and an amalgamation of @entity29 and @entity31 - stye attributes			1
the only thing missing is a dry , tasteless piece of gum			0
" we 're releasing them in waves of eight going in order , so there actually will be 56 cards total , " @entity4 said			1
" so there will be four secret geeks included			2
" already in the collection of 52 are such geek luminaries as @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
@entity4 has gone from fanboy to respected interviewer and entrepreneur thanks to this geeky experiment			1
" i 'm selling the cards because i knew people wanted them			2
i wanted to hold on to them , i wanted them to be physical , " he said			0
thanks to society 's recent acceptance of geeky enthusiasm , @entity4 is convinced it 's possible to turn nerd obsession indulgence into a viable career option			1
" we 're at a point where you 're allowed to geek out and you 're allowed to be kind of goofy , " he said			2
@entity70 , who played @entity71 on " @entity72 , " sees things slightly differently			1
as " @entity77 47 , @entity70 was portrayed as " the comedian " from @entity76 's graphic novel , " @entity75			1
" " i love the sneer and the cigar			0
i love that i am a badass ( geek )			2
i love that you can be badass and a geek and i think that @entity4 nailed it , " he said			1
@entity85 , author of " @entity86 " comic books and novels like " @entity89 " and " @entity90 , " was " @entity91 35 , depicted as " @entity92			0
" " the depictions of people on the ' @entity3 ' cards are always fundamentally iconic , " he said			1
" for a storyteller , there 's probably little that 's more iconic than one of the old @entity101 horror hosts			2
" " obviously , i was consumed with bitter envy with my friends who were depicted as superheroes , " he said , but admitted he would rather be cobwebby and in a crypt somewhere			0
@entity70 said the trading cards are unique because , " it is a window into the lives of people you would n't otherwise get to know in this way			1
it shows that it is cool to be a geek and that there are many very cool people who have a whole geek side that their professions do n't allow out			2
" " part of the fun of geek a week is actually celebrating the people who do n't normally get their cards , " said @entity85			1
" because if you ask your average person in the street who @entity126 was , they might look at you with puzzled eyes and hazard a guess as to possibly someone in baseball or maybe a politician			0
but if you 're on the right college campus or on the right internet site and mention @entity126 , you will see eyes that light up and people salivate and start humming songs and it becomes this sort of bonding thing			0
" @entity141 -- " @entity146 " host , part of the " mythbusters " team and " @entity91 36 ( as the @entity149 ) -- said , " he really captured what people actually look like			1
he definitely got the essence of people			0
" " he 's honoring people that are sort of outside the box			0
it 's not @entity154 or the glamorous ( celebrities ) , it 's kind of @entity157 culture people , " @entity141 said			1
" ( no. 52 ) was @entity158 , the ' godfather of gaming , ' he called him			0
i really like the fact that he 's honoring a different sort of person			0
" " i think geek is definitely a career path you can take now			2
it 's become something you do n't have to be ashamed of			0
if you 're good at math , you like comic books and you watch ' @entity174 , ' it 's not uncool anymore , " she said			0
" the commercialization of nerd - dom made my career			2
" to commemorate the debut of the " @entity3 " cards , @entity12 is holding a weeklong charity auction of items related to the geeks of the weeks -- including an action figure of @entity71 from " @entity72 " signed by @entity70 , honey from @entity85 's private apiary , signed editions of the first set of @entity188 a week cards and original props from " mythbusters			1
" @entity4 is still amazed at how his project has turned out			1
" it 's weird , because i 'm just a fan , " he said			0
" i 'm no one			0
i 'm an unknown artist and to have ( celebrities donate to the charity ) like that is really edifying			2
" on his journey to a nerdy career , @entity4 has learned " it never hurts to ask , " and he 's been able to connect to geek royalty through the relationships he fostered along the way			1
" i guess what i 've learned is that being friendly , being honest and open and just being a nice person still counts in this world , " he said			2
@entity4 found that his heroes were unpretentious and normal , but that did n't do much to stop the butterflies in his stomach			1
" honestly , i never stopped feeling like a total nerd			0
i always felt like i was still not able to approach the cool - people table , like in high school , " he said			2
" the phrase i 've been using is , i felt like a nerd among nerds			0
" but the nerds love his work			0
" i really like the @entity218 ( card ) , " @entity141 said			1
" she 's just so gothy looking , it 's great ! he definitely captured her			0
" " i want mine , obviously , because dammit , i want my card , " @entity85 said			0
" and i want @entity10 's , because i got to write the back of that one			0
" @entity70 said he wants all the cards			1
but thanks to a frenemy relationship with " @entity3 " card no. 14 , " if i had to pick one , " he said , " @entity228 , so i can tape it to my dart board			0
