-- it takes longer to read books on a @entity3 or an @entity4 versus a printed book , @entity6 of product development consultancy @entity7 discovered in a recent usability survey			1
the study found that reading speeds declined by 6.2 percent on the @entity4 and 10.7 percent on @entity12 compared to print			1
however , @entity6 conceded that the differences in reading speed between the two devices were not " statistically significant because of the data 's fairly high variability " -- in other words , the study did not prove that the @entity4 allowed for faster reading than the @entity3			1
a total of 24 participants ( 10 is about average for a usability survey ) were given short stories by @entity27 to read in print and @entity29 , @entity30 and desktop @entity31 @entity27 was chosen because his work utilizes simple language and is " pleasant and engaging to read			0
" the narratives took an average of 17 minutes and 20 seconds from start to finish -- enough time to get readers fully " immersed " in the stories , @entity6 explained			0
after reading , participants filled out a brief comprehension questionnaire to make sure no one had skimmed through a story			0
users rated their satisfaction with each device ; the @entity4 , @entity3 and printed book scored 5.8 , 5.7 and 5.6 , on a scale of 7 , respectively , while the pc received an average score of 3.6 -- due , in part , because reading on a pc reminded readers of work			1
participants also complained about the weight of the @entity4 and the @entity3 's weak contrast			2
as @entity6 notes , the satisfaction ratings on the survey are promising for the future of e-readers and tablet devices			0
however , i can see universities and businesses taking less kindly to e-readers if further studies prove that they handicap reading speed			2
what do you think of the results ? do you prefer to read on an e-reader , tablet or in print -- and why ? Â© 2010 @entity0			0

it takes longer to read books on a kindle or an @entity4 versus a printed book , a study found
@entity83 speeds declined by 6.2 percent on the @entity4 and 10.7 percent on the @entity3
some *people* might *shy* away from e-readers if further studies prove they *affect* reading speed
