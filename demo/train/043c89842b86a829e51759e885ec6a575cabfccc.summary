-- a @entity3 man 's decision to put tattoos on his two dogs is drawing yelps of criticism and wagging tails of support across social media			1
@entity11 , a tattoo artist , said he put the intricate tattoos on the bellies of his two dogs so they could be easily identified if they were lost			1
" they both have their tattoos on them just in case anything happens to them , " @entity11 told @entity0 affiliate @entity14			2
in fact , tattooing is an acceptable form of identification for animals and even is one method advocated by @entity27			1
" have dogs microchipped or tattooed through the @entity32 , " @entity27 says on its website , pointing out that unidentified animals can fall into the wrong hands			1
" it is a crime in some states to perform experiments on animals with tattoos , " @entity27 says			1
the @entity32 recommends on its website that a number of the owner 's choice be tattooed on the pet in an easily visible spot			0
but on social media , some of @entity11 's critics say he took the identification idea too far			2
" my opinion is that if you want to mark your dog you do n't have to do it so large			0
the skin on a dog 's stomach is thin and will be more painful for the healing process			0
nothing wrong with a small marking but a large one is a little much , " @entity54 wrote in a post on @entity11 's facebook page			0
and on @entity60 , @entity61 , managing editor and @entity64 editor of @entity65 , posted , " it 's a pretty big tattoo ; seems overboard for just identification purposes , does n't it ? " @entity11 , who said the animals were sedated when the tattoos were applied , disagrees			1
" it 's just art ; i 'm an artist , i want to put art on my dogs , " he said			2
and he certainly has his supporters			0
writing on the @entity76 page of @entity0 affiliate @entity77 , @entity74 said her pets have tattoos applied at local spay - and - neuter clinics			0
" i wish their tattoos were this creative , " @entity74 wrote .			0
