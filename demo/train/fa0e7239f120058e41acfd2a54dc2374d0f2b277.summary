@entity0 -- bipartisanship is usually seen as a good thing			1
it 's about opposing sides working together to reach a middle - ground , crafting legislation that gets things done			1
in times when neither political party is able to compromise on issues like forced spending cuts , gun control or even saving the @entity14 , bipartisanship -- like what was seen in the passage of funding legislation to avoid a government shutdown in late march -- has rarely been more important			1
but what about times when both parties worked together and things went wrong ? politicians from both sides supported throwing @entity26 - @entity25 in internment camps in the early days of @entity28 in the 19th and 20th centuries , state legislatures across the @entity30 locked arms to pass laws restricting the right to vote of millions of people			1
and a nearly unanimous vote by @entity37 in 1964 led to a virtual blank check for president @entity39 to escalate @entity25 's involvement in @entity41			1
" you can go through history and there has been bipartisan support for bad things , " said @entity42 , director of the @entity43 at @entity44			1
the @entity26 interment camps resulted from an executive order , but neither side in @entity37 spoke out against it			1
" in wartime , you know , that was clearly unjustified and clearly a basic violation of everything we stand for in terms of human rights , " @entity42 said			2
" what you had was a very , very fearful @entity65 public , which influenced what happened			2
" @entity68 , a history professor at @entity69 , pointed out the @entity70 on @entity41 in 1964			2
it passed the @entity72 unanimously and the @entity73 with only two votes in opposition			2
" a lot of unfortunate things have been passed because both parties can get swept up in the fear and urgency of the moment and nobody 's willing to or brave enough to stand up and say this is wrong , " said @entity76 , a history professor at the @entity77			1
@entity76 pointed to the @entity86 in 2001 and the resolution to go to war with @entity89 as his examples of bad pieces of bipartisan action			1
the @entity86 was passed little over a month after the 9/11 terror attacks , but questions were subsequently raised about expanded law enforcement surveillance powers in terrorism investigations			2
allowing detainment of non- @entity25 citizens suspected of terrorism without specific charges also drew scrutiny			2
@entity37 voted overwhelmingly in favor of going to war in @entity89 in 2003 , citing imminent fears that @entity105 was hiding weapons of mass destruction			2
but none were ever found and the war went on for nearly a decade			0
there have been other cases not involving war or national crisis			1
" @entity118 exclusion was pretty popular by @entity119 and @entity120 , " said @entity76 about the @entity114 passed by @entity37 at the height of anti-chinese sentiment in the @entity25 in 1882			0
the law imposed severe restrictions on @entity118 immigration -- which originally focused on " skilled and unskilled laborers employed in mining " but later was extended to all @entity118 wishing to immigrate to or remain in @entity25			0
another example of bipartisan acquiesce was in civil rights			1
" republicans in the early 20th century allowed @entity119 to control the @entity30 and the disenfranchisement of african - americans in the @entity30 , " said @entity129 , a history professor at the @entity130			0
led by @entity119 , state legislatures throughout the @entity30 passed several laws in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to discourage or prevent blacks from voting			0
@entity129 said with @entity140 laws , immorality was condoned because neither side wanted to do the right thing and fight			0
" the partisan response would have been to support @entity65 voting rights , " he said			0
those laws were largely curtailed by the @entity147			0
but enforcement of the landmark measure is under review now by the @entity25 @entity151			0
justices are considering an appeal that federal government intervention is no longer necessary to ensure that african - americans can go to the polls			0
when asked about good pieces of partisan legislation , @entity76 looks at events right after the @entity160			0
" if you go back to the 1800s , @entity120 jammed through all of the civil rights legislation -- including the 13th , 14th and 15th amendments -- that were crucial to our framework of rights , " said @entity76 , " and that was done in a highly partisan manner			0
" @entity171 , a political science professor at @entity172 , pointed to @entity173 , @entity174 and key pieces of civil rights legislation that were opposed by many , including conservatives , but passed anyway because of support from members of both parties			1
" it took strong partisan majorities in @entity37 to get those things , " said @entity171 , " it would n't have happened without that			0

the ability of both sides to come together has long been valued in @entity0
there are several instances where questionable action is bipartisan
in most cases , *decisions* are driven by conflict or national crisis
in other cases , *inaction* by both parties leads to immoral policy , *experts* say
