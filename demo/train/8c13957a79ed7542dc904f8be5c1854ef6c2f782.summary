here 's a tip for traveling in @entity2 : whatever time you 've allotted for a venue or attraction , triple it			1
everything in @entity10 's second largest city ( after @entity11 ) is better than you think it 's going to be , and you 'll want more time to explore and enjoy			1
case in point is @entity14 , a gigantic , modern jjimjilbang ( @entity18 - style sauna / spa ) located inside @entity19 @entity14 , reportedly the world 's largest department store , which opened four years ago			1
before seeing @entity23 , i had set aside an hour for a visit -- the usual amount of time i allot for soaking and scrubbing at a @entity18 bathhouse			1
coming from @entity11 , i was skeptical about how different one jjimjilbang could be from any other			0
the capital , after all , is well known for its extravagant spas			0
boy , was i mistaken			0
a spa like no other @entity14 's @entity23 takes the jjimjilbang concept to an entirely new place			1
while @entity11 jjimjilbangs tend to be mobbed 24 hours a day with families and groups of friends , @entity23 presents a more refined , upscale and leisurely experience			1
despite state - of - the - art facilities , admission fees are reasonable -- ₩ 12,000 ( $ 10.50 ) on weekdays and ₩ 14,000 ( $ 12.25 ) on weekends			1
students get a slight discount and -- here 's an interesting kicker -- children under 13 are n't allowed inside , an unheard of concept in @entity10 , where families often make weekend rituals of jjimjilbang visits			2
another unusual feature is the four - hour limit on stays			2
most @entity18 jjimjilbangs are open 24 hours and often serve as a crash pad for over-indulgent partiers , many of whom prefer to sleep off the effects of the night in a spa rather than face the repercussions of coming home late and smelling like the inside of a brewery vat			2
how to do @entity23 right the first thing @entity68 want to know about a jjimjilbang is whether the water is special enough to bathe in			1
the water in @entity23 's baths and pools is pumped from two types of hot springs that lie 100 meters underground , and which are sterilized 36 times a day			1
the " sodium bicarbonate hot spring " is the " beauty bathtub , " said by the spa to " remove your dead skin cells and make your skin and hair shiny			1
" the " sodium chloride hot spring " is " similar to seawater " and has a " heat - preservation effect " that is " good for blood circulation and helps to relieve pain from neuralgia and backache			1
" the spa ritual itself is familiar			2
visitors change into cotton shirts and pants handed out at reception			0
then they head to communal areas			0
there 's a tarot card reading station set up near the entrance , but most people beeline past this and head straight for the outdoor foot bath area			1
here there 's a large heated pool for wading back and forth , as well as private booths where couples often play games on their phones while perched precariously above pools of water			1
theme rooms @entity23 has dreamed up a variety of themes for its many steam and sauna rooms			1
these range from extremely hot ( i could n't enter this one without yelping in pain ) to extremely cold ( the @entity122 has a cute , fake jellyfish aquarium ) to the gimmicky			2
how gimmicky ? the walls of the pyramid room are set at a 52 - degree angle , " which has been said to be the easiest angle to collect energies from the universe , " according to the spa			1
the @entity132 room " radiates electrons from @entity132 " meant to " metabolize your body rapidly			2
" the theme rooms are fun to take pictures in			0
the downstairs snack bar serves bingsu ( a beloved @entity18 shaved ice dessert ) and various vinegar drinks said to be good for the skin			0
customers can take the snacks and eat them all around the bathhouse			0
upstairs there 's a restaurant and cafe run by chefs from the @entity149			2
alcohol consumption is limited to 500 ml per person , to prevent sauna accidents and overly rambunctious parties from disrupting the austere atmosphere			0
bath time my favorite spot in the spa is the outdoor rock pool in the women - only bathing area			1
i soaked under its sodium bicarbonate waterfall for a good 20 minutes before my appointment with the @entity164 ( scrub ladies ) in the scrub room			2
for 25 minutes i beached myself on a plastic slab , and gave myself over to the capable hands of a professional scrubber			0
clad in black bras and panties ( standard scrub uniform ) , she scoured my entire body with two loofahs			0
" @entity178 ladies are the most sensitive , " she said in an amused voice when i squeaked a little			0
" the older ladies always ask for the hardest pressure			0
" i emerged red and raw , but wonderfully clean			0
it was the best extra ₩ 20,000 ( $ 18 ) i 've ever spent in spa			0
next time i 'll plan on three hours for a visit			0
@entity186 , @entity14 , 35 @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity2 , @entity10 ; +82 51 745 2900 ; open daily , 6 a.m. - midnight			0

@entity190 offers refined , upscale spa experience
even spa - jaded @entity68 are *awestruck* by this state - of - the - art spa
water in @entity23 's baths comes from hot springs 100 meters underground
walls of pyramid room are set at a 52 - degree angle to " collect energies from the universe "
