-- the ' @entity1 ' is back in football			0
dumped unceremoniously by @entity6 soccer 's most successful club @entity4 less than a season into his six - year deal , @entity3 is the new coach at @entity10			1
the @entity11 will take the reins at the @entity14 club whose defeat of champions @entity16 at the weekend moved it out of the relegation zone courtesy of goal difference			1
it is @entity3 ' first job in football since being sacked by @entity4 in april			1
he was hand - picked to take over at @entity24 by predecessor sir @entity25 , who retired after 27 years at the club			1
despite that backing from @entity25 -- who won 13 @entity29 titles and two @entity30 crowns during a trophy - littered spell -- @entity3 lasted barely 10 months			1
@entity10 confirmed the appointment on its official website			2
a statement read : " @entity10 have reached an agreement with @entity3 who has been appointed coach of the first team until june 30 2016			1
" details about the official presentation of @entity10 's new coach and who will form part of his technical team will be published [ on tuesday ] morning			1
" the 51 - year - old follows a pair of @entity49 managers to have coached @entity10 , based in the town of @entity51 , 14 miles from the border with @entity53 on @entity14 's northern coast			1
former @entity56 striker @entity55 , from @entity57 , had three spells as manager of the club , winning the @entity61 in 1987 , while @entity62 , now in charge of the @entity65 national team , had a six - month spell in 2007			2
while fans and commentators have reacted positively to @entity3 ' appointment , @entity14 football expert @entity67 thinks it does represent something of a gamble on both sides			1
" the local newspaper here is pleased because @entity3 has a certain cache but if you look at what he 's done since 1993 when he signed as a player for @entity81 he 's moved in the radius of about 60 kilometers , " @entity67 , who is based in @entity51 , told @entity0			2
" it 's not exactly the profile of the international manager is it ? i 'm not suggesting he 's incapable of adapting but there 's going to be a period of adapting			0
the obvious challenge is learning @entity14 and also adapting to a new league			2
" it 's not a gamble in the sense that he 's an experienced manager , but it is in the sense that he 's what i would call a slightly parochial sort of manager			0
" to call a person parochial when they 've been in the @entity29 for so long is wrong but i just do n't think he 's ever contemplated going abroad			0
" i think it is circumstances that have pushed him to suddenly become a person that who has decided to go abroad			0
at the age of 51 , you 're not exactly a young guy going abroad			0
" to be fair to him , he 's moving out of his comfort zone but he also needs to re-establish his name			0
whether @entity10 is the right choice , i do n't know			0
" dubbed ' @entity117 ' by supporters after his anointing by @entity25 , @entity3 moved to @entity4 after an 11 - year spell with @entity121 in which he consolidated them as a top - eight @entity29 club			1
he won his first competitive match in charge of @entity4 , beating @entity126 2 - 0 in the @entity127 that pits the @entity29 winners against the @entity130 winners as the traditional curtain raiser to the season			1
but @entity4 were quickly off the pace in the title race and suffered a string of home defeats to mid-table clubs , as well as a derby thumping by @entity139			0
after going out of both domestic cup competitions in january , @entity4 were dumped out of the @entity30 at the quarterfinals stage by then - holders @entity143			2
ironically , after a defeat to @entity121 on his first return as @entity4 manager , @entity3 was sacked in april , just 10 months after taking charge , with the club lying in seventh place			1
ball thinks @entity3 ' stint at @entity121 will help his reign at @entity10 , who place a big emphasis on developing local talent through their ' cantera ' -- or youth academy			1
" sociedad are sixth in the @entity161 league of providing professional players to themselves and any other teams , above @entity164 and only two places behind @entity166 , which is astonishing , " he explained			0
" @entity3 was successful , not on a shoestring -- @entity121 were n't a poor club but they were n't rich either -- and he was clever in making those medium - guy signings and making them good			1
" he 's been quite shrewd in the transfer market but i do n't think he 's drawn particularly from @entity161 knowledge			0
he does n't really know the market , the league , or the style of play that well			0
" a manager of his knowledge and experience obviously knows the basics of what goes on here but it still might be a bit of a shock for him			0
" one thing @entity3 does seem to have grasped is the club 's distinct identity			2
located in the @entity190 country , @entity67 says some associated with @entity10 do n't even like for it to be known as a @entity14 club			1
it espouses similar values to @entity164 , located 100km west of @entity51 , who only select players from the @entity190 region to represent the club			0
though financial constraints prevent @entity10 from adopting a similar policy , according to @entity67 , in many ways it is more @entity190 in its approach than @entity164			0
and , crucially , @entity3 seems to have grasped this idea of identity in his dealings with @entity10 president @entity206			1
" apparently , @entity3 was incredibly detailed in his interview and was interrogating @entity208 , who is more used to interviewing the manager , " @entity67 said			2
" the president was impressed by that and by the homework @entity3 had done			0
" @entity206 laid it down and told @entity3 he was coming to a very special club with a special identity			2
he told him it was n't @entity14 , it was the @entity190 country which is different culturally and politically , and a club that does n't even like to known as @entity14			2
" he was impressed by the fact @entity3 had realised this , from what i can gather			0
