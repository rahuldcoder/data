-- this weekend marks the kickoff of what millions of @entity2 have been looking forward to since the final minutes of @entity6 's @entity5 victory in early february -- another football season			0
players , primed and ready , will take to the field , inspired to make their mark on the new season			0
loyal fans , football - starved from a long offseason , will tune in to cheer on their hometown teams			0
no one can avoid the nervous energy that defines the start of a new season			0
but one thing fans should never have to worry about is whether or not this week 's game will be impossible to watch due to a tv blackout			2
it is unfortunate that we will kick off yet another football season with federal rules on the books that serve only to protect the leagues at the expense of sports fans			0
one of these rules is the @entity33 's ( @entity33 ) sports blackout rule , which prohibits a cable or satellite company from carrying a game that is blacked - out within the local broadcast area			1
while this affects leagues beyond the @entity41 , it occurs most often when , under the @entity41 's rules , a home game does not sell out at least 72 hours before kickoff			1
under the @entity33 's sports blackout rule , cable and satellite companies are unable to televise that game in the local broadcast market , leaving local fans in the dark			1
while the blackout rule was originally cast as a way to encourage ticket sales , this rationale is no longer supported by the facts			1
the @entity33 is aware of this and voted unanimously last december to propose elimination of the rule , acknowledging that the record does not support the argument that blackouts increase ticket sales and that " the sports blackout rules have become obsolete			1
" the comment period for this change concluded long ago , and the well - developed record clearly supports erasing the blackout rule from the books			0
but we are still waiting on the commission to cast a final vote			0
we wrote @entity33 commissioner @entity71 in june , urging him to bring the rule to a final vote before the start of the new @entity41 season and he indicated the @entity33 will do so by " early fall			1
" that time has now come , another season is upon us , and there is no reason to further delay			0
this is not a partisan issue , as a clear majority of @entity33 members from both political parties supports striking the rule			2
in an increasingly divided government , it would be a breath of fresh air for @entity92 and @entity93 @entity91 to unite with football fans and vote to spike this outdated regulation			2
it is not surprising that since the vote last december , the @entity41 has launched an expensive lobbying and public relations campaign aimed at ensuring the blackout rule stays on the books			1
their efforts have obscured the facts , arguing erroneously that the sports blackout rule has worked since its inception nearly 40 years ago			0
unfortunately for the league , facts are stubborn things			0
research by sports economists indicates there is no link between the blackout rule and stadium attendance			0
the league has even threatened to move games from free broadcast tv to pay services like cable if the @entity33 carries through with the vote			1
this last - minute pitch is all for the purpose of protecting the @entity41 's bottom line and preserving the status quo , which netted the league over $ 9 billion in revenues last year			2
further , the @entity41 enjoys nonprofit status -- meaning it pays no income tax -- and many games are played in stadiums financed in large part with taxpayer dollars			1
federal regulations should n't favor multi-billion dollar sports leagues over consumers , especially when those leagues have benefited so greatly from those very same taxpayers and sports fans			2
as the new season begins , we hope the @entity33 will do the right thing , and immediately vote to eliminate this outdated anti-consumer rule			1
at a time when @entity145 does n't seem capable of achieving much , making sure fans are n't left in the dark this season could count as a real accomplishment , one deserving a cheer from the @entity2 people .			2

@entity153 , @entity154 : @entity41 game blackouts are unfair to fans
they say @entity33 should vote to end rule that permits the blackouts when stadiums are n't full
@entity41 already benefits by laws that enable it to be a nonprofit , they say
point : blacking out games does n't help ticket sales
