-- after hours of back and forth between members , the @entity1 decided friday evening to accept noncelibate clergy members and lay leaders who are in " lifelong " and " monogamous " same - sex relationships			1
previous @entity1 policy allows gay and lesbian clergy , lay people to serve only if celibate			1
one of the country 's largest protestant denominations , the lutheran church approved four recommendations to its ministry 's policies that underscore a new approach to homosexuality			1
while the recommendations passed at the weeklong @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , do not address recognizing same - sex marriage or civil unions , they do allow congregations to support same - sex relationships among their members and allow individuals in same - sex relationships to hold clergy positions			1
the previous policy of the 4.6 - million member church allowed gay people to serve as members of professional rosters only if they were celibate			1
some members argued prior to the vote that the change would fly in the face of religious teachings			2
" brothers and sisters , i ask you , before you dig yourselves deeper into this hole , if you are so absolutely certain that these behaviors are not sinful that you are willing to place yourselves and this church at the spiritual risk that comes from encouraging sin , " said the rev. @entity41 of the @entity42			2
among those on the other side was @entity52 of the @entity53			2
" if according to some i am going to be in err for supporting this ... let me err on the side of mercy , grace , justice , and love of neighbor			2
let me err on the side of gospel , which makes all things new			2
" many feared the emotional debate could tear at the unity of the church			0
so the members voted to re-order their resolutions -- moving to the top a resolution that the church " commit itself to bear one another 's burdens , love thy neighbor , and respect the bound consciences of all			0
" it passed with overwhelming support			0
other religious denominations , including @entity81 and @entity82 , have made moves to accept gay clergy , and @entity85 would not be the first to accept those openly in same - sex relationships , said @entity88 , a senior researcher at the @entity89			1
but @entity1 would be the largest to make such a move			1
the church is the third largest protestant denomination , representing 2 percent of the @entity93 population , according to the @entity89			0
the battle friday was the latest in what @entity88 said many " socially moderate " denominations , including those in @entity98 , are grappling with : balancing the growing acceptance of same - sex relationships with traditional teachings			1
as some have moved toward accepting same - sex relationships , within those same denominations " you see more conservative wings that are pushing back against it , " said @entity88			1
on hand for friday 's debate were hundreds of " interested parties " -- including some people who are not members of the church , said @entity114 , @entity1 spokesman			1
when asked whether there had been protests or rallies on either side outside the convention site , he responded , " interestingly , no. " in the convention hall , @entity114 said , " the debates have n't been rancorous or mean - spirited in any way			0
they 've been quite civil			0
but people have been passionate with their feelings			0
" the rev. @entity126 of the @entity127 said a vote in favor of the resolutions would cause members of her own family to leave the church			0
her sister " felt her church was being ripped away from her , " @entity126 said tearfully , adding , i urge you not to do this to all of those people in the pew and in my family			0
" @entity143 of the @entity144 said some " dear members " of the church will be lost if the resolution passes			0
but , she said , " a vote to reject this recommendation sends a message to the world saying ' not all are welcome			0
' " in a " changing world , " @entity143 argued , the @entity1 " needs to be a voice that stands up and says ' yes			1
' " @entity0 's @entity155 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 to accept gay clergy in lifelong relationships
new policy would allow them to serve if in monogamous relationships
