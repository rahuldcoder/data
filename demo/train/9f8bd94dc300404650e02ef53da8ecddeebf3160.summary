-- this year , some real - life drama surrounds the soap - focused @entity2			0
a few weeks before the ceremony , the @entity4 issued a casting call for social media mavens to host the event 's live - streamed red carpet preshow			1
specifically , as reported by @entity10 , organizers wanted " millennials between the ages of 18 - 35 , all ethnicities , who have a strong entertainment news background and / or very strong social media following ( 300,000 followers minimum )			0
" last wednesday , the @entity4 revealed that it had selected a foursome with a mighty social reach : vine star @entity22 , style vlogger @entity21 , beauty vlogger @entity23 , and @entity24 , who vlogs about style and beauty			2
the chosen four certainly have large followings on sites like @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity22 , and @entity32 € ” but their collective entertainment - news backgrounds are n't quite as strong			2
after a red carpet show criticized as amateurish and occasionally downright offensive , some irate viewers are demanding that @entity4 issue an apology for @entity22 , @entity21 , @entity23 , and @entity24 's antics			1
among the offenses the women committed , as outlined by @entity43 's @entity42 : @entity22 " literally came onto , and hard , every male in attendance , to a degree that makes @entity48 's @entity47 look positively demure " ( see , for example , this interaction with @entity50 ) ; @entity23 called @entity53 's @entity52 " a beautiful chocolate man " before asking , apropos of nothing , " what 's it like to be a black man on a soap opera these days ? " most egregiously , @entity22 bid goodbye to @entity61 actor @entity60 by saying , " we 're going to get you away from us before we rape you			0
" viewers were swift to criticize the hosts , especially for @entity22 's casual evocation of rape			1
the four hostsâ € ” and the @entity68 € ” have yet to respond directly to the criticism			0
@entity22 did , however , tweet this not - so - subtle message in the wee hours of monday morning : see the original story at @entity0			1
