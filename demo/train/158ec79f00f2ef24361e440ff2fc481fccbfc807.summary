@entity0 will be welcoming you to @entity2 for the next year , but many of the city 's residents are already wishing the megastar had stayed in @entity7			1
@entity0 ? what about @entity9 , @entity10 or even @entity11 ? named the city 's first global welcome ambassador for its " @entity15 " campaign -- she has a song of the same name -- @entity0 is attracting criticism as a carpetbagger			1
she bought a $ 19.9 million apartment in @entity24 's @entity23 neighborhood this year			2
it 's not exactly the act of a struggling artist from elsewhere , inspired by @entity28 to roll the dice on the city that never sleeps			1
or even a local girl from the @entity32 riding the 6 train to make it in @entity24			0
her lack of @entity2 tenure led many to question why she 's qualified to define @entity2 - isms like the bodega ( corner market ) , the stoop ( stairs used like a front porch ) and how to say @entity43 ( " how - stun " )			1
@entity0 's new single to benefit @entity2 schools and picking a latte as the food of choice for the city ? " yes , we all know @entity2 lattes -- maple ones -- hold special significance for @entity0 , " writes @entity46 in the @entity47 , " but a latte is not like a slice of pizza , or a bagel , or a pickleback , which is to say it is not a quintessentially , or even an overtly , @entity2 foodstuff			1
" we are not questioning the power of her brand , her kindness to her many adoring fans or her uncanny ability to nail the breakup song			0
( listen to " @entity69 " and " @entity70 " and you 'll see			0
) an ambassador to our country 's largest and most exciting and diverse city does n't have to be born there			1
but surely she needs to have done something there besides spend money and drink lattes			0
of course , she 's not selling the real @entity2 , where working - class people struggle to find affordable housing ( never mind buying a home ) ; where rising retail rents are pushing independent bars , music venues and shops out for " one size fits all " chain stores			1
she 's selling the shiny , clean version that 's sanitized and easy and wo n't snatch your wallet			2
maybe she 'll get her hands dirty , learn some tough lessons from the city -- despite her money -- and earn her title to represent those 8 million stories that rapper @entity97 loves			2
in the meantime , we prefer the real version , represented by native and transplanted @entity2 we love			1
that 's why @entity103 nominates the following folks who have made a real mark on the city to be our @entity2 global ambassadors			1
@entity9 we know @entity108 spent a cool $ 22 million to buy an apartment overlooking @entity110 , but really , the superstar singer / actress / dancer is a good @entity112 girl from the @entity32			0
and the @entity32 , the birthplace of hip - hop and so much good food and culture , deserves its share of tourists			0
he grew up in the @entity120 neighborhood of @entity121 , his parents still live there , and he keeps an office there			0
and he 's angry that gentrification is pushing many african - americans out while services are improving for the richer , often white , residents moving into the neighborhood			2
this year at a @entity131 lecture , @entity118 said his father , a jazz musician , bought a brownstone 46 years ago			0
and the new neighbors " called the cops on my father			0
he 's not -- he does n't even play electric bass			2
we bought the motherf * * * in ' house in 1968 , and now you call the cops ? " @entity146 @entity145 some pinpoint the birthplace of hip - hop as a rec room in the @entity32 where @entity145 and his sister launched a back - to - school party in 1973			0
he has not made the millions that others have made off his creativity , but he gets the credit for a music style the put the @entity32 on the map			0
and @entity103 's own @entity159 thinks he 's cool			2
@entity11 @entity2 recognize the @entity160 with his strict rules for how you may buy his food , the @entity164 that changes its rules on a daily basis , the lousy diner that stays open for some ungodly reason			1
@entity120 - born comedian @entity11 , who popularized these concepts , is already an informal ambassador to @entity2			1
@entity11 sold his twisted , grumpy , " @entity11 " version of @entity2 for nine seasons on @entity172 , and he became a multimillionaire as a result			1
see his 1990s @entity2 on episodes in syndication and his favorite clips on his website			1
@entity180 though we love noted writer and speaker @entity180 's work , we admit there 's one slight problem with her nomination : she hates tourism			2
" tourism as a number - one industry is a terrible , terrible idea for any city , especially @entity2 , " she told @entity190 magazine			1
" if you were going to turn a city , which is a place where people live , into a tourist attraction , you 're going to have to make it a place that people who do n't live here , like			2
so i object to living in a place for people who do n't live here			0
as it became more and more intense , it became more and more a place where the actual citizens are pushed out to the edges			0
" the naked cowboy who does n't love @entity213 's naked cowboy , known off - duty as @entity214 ? our favorite cowboy is n't totally clothes - free : for more than 15 years , he 's worn his tight white briefs , a cowboy hat and boots for his street performances			2
pictures from all over the world crowd his @entity225 page , showing lots of sequins and other decor on his derriere			0
hey , every city needs a little sex appeal			2
@entity232 ( tentative ) yes , we know @entity2 native @entity232 is new besties with @entity0			1
@entity232 's boyfriend , @entity235 ( of the group fun			0
) co-wrote two songs on @entity0 's new album , so it could be a mix of business and pleasure			1
but she works and breathes and lives her show , " girls , " in the city			0
if she could just reflect a more diverse @entity2 than the homogenous city that exists in " girls , " we might move her out of the " tentative " category			1
in 2000 , @entity120 was about 41 % white , 36 % black , 8 % @entity249 and 20 % @entity250 ( of any race )			0
time to wake up and smell the demographics			0
@entity10 who can dispute @entity10 's nomination after listening to his ode to the city that never sleeps ? the city is in his bones			1
" me , i 'm out that @entity259 , home of that boy @entity261 now i live on @entity263 and i brought my boys with me say what up to @entity267 , still sippin ' @entity265 's @entity269 ' courtside , @entity270 & @entity271 give me high five			0

@entity0 is @entity2 's first global welcome ambassador
@entity0 's newest album features a pop ode to the city that never sleeps
her city bona fides are questionable when *compared* with other lovers of @entity2
