-- this year marks the 20th anniversary of the opening of the @entity3 linking @entity4 with the @entity5 , and the 50th anniversary of the deal which led to its creation			1
to mark the occasion , we 're taking a look at some of the world 's greatest tunnels			1
@entity3 ( @entity5 and @entity4 ) connecting the @entity5 with continental @entity16 ( it has entrances / exits in @entity19 , @entity20 , and @entity21 in northern @entity4 ) , the tunnel has the world 's longest undersea section -- 37.9 kilometers ( 23.5 miles )			1
though a marvel of the modern age , it was n't a new idea when it was built			0
@entity4 engineer @entity29 proposed a tunnel under the @entity31 in 1802 , although his plans included an artificial island mid-channel where horse - drawn carriages could make maintenance stops			1
" this tunnel defined the term ' mega project , ' " says @entity37 , tunnel expert and director at engineering company @entity39			2
" it fundamentally changed the geography of @entity16 and helped to reinforce high speed rail as a viable alternative to short - haul flights			1
" length : 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) fast fact : though both the @entity51 and @entity4 put in work to build the @entity3 , the @entity51 side tunneled a greater distance			1
more info : @entity55 @entity56 ( @entity57 , @entity58 ) the @entity56 in @entity58 is the world 's longest road tunnel and cost $ 153 million to build , which works out at $ 6,250 per meter			1
the length of the tunnel prompted engineers to include various features designed to alleviate claustrophobia and tiredness			2
" the sheer length of tunnel -- which takes 20 minutes to drive through -- led to innovation in the use of behavioral science and driver psychology in the design to reduce driver fatigue and improve safety , " says @entity37			2
" this resulted in large , colorfully lit caverns every six kilometers , providing points of interest and a unique driver experience			0
" length : 24.5 kilometers ( 15.2 miles ) fast fact : engineers separated the tunnel into different sections to give the illusion that drivers are traveling through a number of smaller tunnels			1
in these smaller sections drivers can take breaks , or even have a wedding ceremony , as one adventurous couple has previously done			0
more info : the @entity97 @entity98 ( @entity99 ) it 's easy to mistake this tunnel for a bridge because part of the structure comprises a 4.4 - kilometer span as well as a 9.6 - kilometer subsea conduit			1
the @entity98 crosses @entity98 and connects the cities of @entity107 and @entity108			0
it reduced the journey time between the two from 90 to 15 minutes			0
" this project required the world 's largest undersea tunnel boring machines and set the precedent for constructing two - lane road tunnels , " points out @entity37 at @entity39			1
" the resilience of the construction was demonstrated during the 2011 @entity121 - @entity120 earthquake , which caused severe damage to @entity98			2
" length : 14 kilometers total ( 8.7 miles ) fast fact : constructed atop the @entity98 is an island that functions as a rest area and mall			0
the man - made island , called @entity130 , is a popular scenic point with an observation deck that gives a great view of @entity98			2
more info : @entity135 @entity136 ( @entity137 ) @entity137 's @entity139 road tunnel is one of the world 's highest , located 3,401 meters ( 11,158 feet ) above sea level , at the highest point on the @entity145 interstate highway system			1
it played a significant role in the women 's rights movement when @entity149 was hired as a construction worker in 1972			2
her supervisor misread her name as @entity154 , but realized his mistake and reassigned her to administrative duties after workers -- many of whom were former miners -- cited the common superstition that a woman 's presence can bring bad luck to a mine			2
@entity149 sued and was allowed to return to the tunnel			2
a new equal rights law was subsequently passed			0
length : 2.72 kilometers ( 1.7 miles ) fast fact : prior to the tunnel 's official opening in 1972 , a drunk driver believed he should be the first person to take a vehicle through and was arrested for trespassing			1
charges were subsequently dropped because the signs prohibiting traffic were considered inadequate			0
more info : @entity178 @entity179 ( @entity180 , @entity58 ) the dramatic @entity182 road tunnel , built in 1961 and comprising six spirals covering 1,649 meters ( 5,413 feet ) , leads to one of the most spectacular viewpoints in the industrial town of @entity180			1
" despite being an expensive country , @entity58 builds some of the cheapest tunnels , " says @entity187 , head of tunnels at engineering consultancy @entity189			1
" this is because the engineers strip the design down to the bare essentials required for the flow of traffic in the tunnels			0
maximum benefit for minimum effort -- that 's good engineering			2
" length : 1.65 kilometers ( 1.02 miles ) fast fact : the tunnel opens out to a dramatic view of @entity207 and has a beer garden , restaurants and open - air museum			1
@entity211 ( @entity212 , @entity213 ) before the construction of this impressive tunnel , the only way to access the village of @entity211 was via a narrow path carved into the side of the @entity220			2
in 1972 , a group of 13 villagers decided to construct a tunnel , which they dug by hand			2
three died during the construction process but the tunnel transformed the village and became a tourist attraction in its own right			2
" this tunnel is beautiful and a tribute the tenacity of the villagers who built it , " says @entity187 at @entity189			0
" for me it emphasizes how tunnel construction can enhance the environment as well as bringing huge benefits for society			0
at the same time , one should remember the cost and the fact that several villagers were killed during construction			0
" length : 1.2 kilometers ( 0.74 miles ) fast fact : the tunnel was built jagged and steep due to the village 's primitive tools , earning it the nickname : " the road that does not tolerate any mistakes			1
" @entity254 ( @entity255 , @entity256 ) " @entity254 is a combined road and flood relief tunnel , " explains @entity187 at @entity189			1
" it can be completely flooded to get rid of storm water and turned back into a road in a few hours			0
" the tunnel , the longest in @entity256 , was built to solve the problem of flash flooding in @entity255			1
@entity254 can operate in three ways			0
when there 's no flooding , it serves purely as a road tunnel			1
when there are floods , rainwater can be diverted into a lower channel , and the upper level will remain open to traffic			0
when exceptionally heavy floods occur , the tunnel closes to all traffic and watertight gates open to allow floodwater to flow through			0
length : 9.7 kilometers ( 6.02 miles ) fast fact : the tunnel is expected to prevent billions of dollars of possible flood damage and costs from traffic congestion			0
since it opened in 2007 , flood - prone areas such as @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 and @entity290 have been spared inundation			0
more info : @entity294 @entity295 ( @entity296 ) this underwater @entity213 tunnel is short and sweet , but spectacular and slightly strange			0
it spans the @entity299 and connects @entity296 's @entity295 to @entity300 , location of the @entity302			0
passengers were originally going to be ferried from one side to the other on a moving walkway , but automated cars were installed instead			0
length : 646.7 meters ( 2,122 feet ) fast fact : a company that had worked with @entity311 was originally supposed to help design the tunnel , but was deemed too expensive			1
instead a @entity296 - based company created the tunnel 's psychedelic lights and trippy audio - visual effects			1
the ride is apparently meant to represent a journey to the core of the earth , and the tunnel currently ranks as one of @entity296 's top five tourist attractions			1
@entity324 ( @entity325 ) the @entity324 is a railway tunnel in @entity325 , but what makes it unique is the fact that a 23 - kilometer ( 14.2 miles ) stretch of the tunnel is 140 meters ( 460 feet ) below sea level			1
it 's the longest and deepest rail tunnel in the world , and spans the @entity335 , connecting @entity336 on the island of @entity338 to the island of @entity340			1
work on the tunnel started in 1964 and was completed in 1988			0
length : 53 kilometers ( 32.9 miles ) fast fact : in 1976 , construction workers hit a patch of soft rock and water gushed into the tunnel at a rate of 80 tons per minute			0
the leak took two months to fix			0

2014 marks the 20th anniversary of the opening of the @entity3
the 24.5 - kilometer @entity56 in @entity58 is the world 's longest road tunnel
at 460 feet below sea level the @entity324 is the longest and deepest rail tunnel in the world
