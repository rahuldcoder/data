if you have a serious medical complaint please consult a physician			1
long hours sitting in an airport or on a train			1
travel is tough on the body			2
about eight years ago i started battling pain whenever i traveled			2
the large muscles up and down my leg and hip would get hard and tight , making sitting , standing or even sleeping painful			1
massages , jacuzzi baths , ibuprofen and yoga alleviated the pain , but temporarily			2
while all were helpful , no remedy really provided the " release " i felt i needed to undo those tight spots			1
a physical therapist suggested pressure point therapy as a way to help the muscles relax			1
she used a device called a @entity33 , a deep - pressure massage device that 's shaped like a large candy cane , to press down hard on my tight spots and help them release			1
voila ! i experienced some relief			2
however , the bulky @entity41 is n't really travel friendly			2
and it requires a second person to use			2
i wondered what might work while traveling , even alone ? the ends of the @entity33 are studded with hard , little plastic balls -- wandering through the aisles of a sporting goods store one day i stumbled across a possible solution : a @entity50 ! for those who are n't familiar with them , the @entity50 ( there are a number of imitators ) is a perforated , rubbery - plastic ball about the size of a baseball			1
for kids , especially in the @entity60 , they 're used to play baseball in safe and confined areas			0
i bought a three - pack for about $ 1.50 and tried one out on my legs -- it worked great			0
wiffle balls are lightweight , durable and inexpensive -- the perfect accessory for on - the - road pressure point relief			1
following the exercises my physical therapist showed me with the @entity33 , i came up with five " do anywhere " moves for instant tension relief			0
foot relief sit in a chair or on the edge of a bed , place the @entity50 under your foot ( starting in the arch ) and slowly roll your foot back and forth over the ball for about two minutes			1
the massage motion will increase blood flow and help release tightness in the arch. 2			0
back rub @entity89 on the floor ( better than the bed , which is too soft ) and place the ball under your shoulder blade			0
slowly rock yourself back and forth over the ball , moving it around the large muscles encasing the blade			1
hip and upper leg tension reliever still on the floor on your back , move the ball under one side of your bottom -- place the ball right in the center of the largest part of the muscle and roll around on top of it , letting it move around the entire buttock and up toward your lower back then down to where the buttock meets the thigh			0
you should feel tension release down the hip and into the leg			0
it band / outer leg reliever runners know the @entity122 well -- it runs along the outside of the leg , down the thigh and over the outer part of the knee			0
roll over onto one side , prop yourself up on an elbow and place the ball just below your hip in the large part of your thigh			0
slowly move yourself up and down while bracing with your elbow , allowing the ball to roll up and down your leg to relieve tension			0
hip flexor release sitting for hours can make the muscles at the front of your hip and leg tighten			1
to release , roll over on your stomach and put the ball right in the spot where your leg meets the hip and lay flat for about a minute , rolling slightly until you find your tightest spots			0
you 'll also access the psoas muscle this way -- the psoas is a rope - like muscle that runs obliquely from spine to the femur -- releasing additional tightness			0
what 's your favorite tip for relieving muscle pain and tightness on the road ? share them with readers below .			0

pressure point therapy can help tight muscles relax after long trips
no need for expensive therapy or fancy *equipment* though
a @entity50 can be an effective solution to various aches and pains
