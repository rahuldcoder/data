@entity0 , @entity1 -- you 're a mean one , mr. @entity3			1
those of us who know @entity3 tend to describe him as not only intelligent but also charming			1
some members of the @entity9 press corps will admit as much , even though they usually do n't agree with @entity11 's views			1
facts should n't get in the way of a good smear			2
and at the moment , the left is trying to dampen the appeal of the former @entity19 speaker and current @entity21 presidential front - runner by likening him to a green and hairy dr. @entity24 character who tries to steal @entity25			0
only in the real life version , @entity11 is supposedly at war with the poor for saying this : " really poor children in really poor neighborhoods have no habits of working and have nobody around them who works , so they literally have no habit of showing up on monday			1
" that narrative was front and center again this week as @entity11 explained his remarks to reporters gathered at a @entity41 conference , emphasizing that he believes the secret to getting @entity43 working again is to teach some @entity43 how to work			1
" i 've been talking a little bit about the importance of work , " @entity11 said , " particularly as it relates to people who are in areas where there are public housing where there are relatively few people who go to work			1
" at one point , @entity11 turned the tables on the reporters and asked them a question			1
he wanted to know , " how many of you earned some money doing something before you were 10 years old , whether it was cutting grass or babysitting or something ? " talk to hugely successful people , @entity11 said , and most of them will say that they got an early start learning about jobs and responsibility and earning money for their labor			1
tragically , that 's not happening with many young people today			2
@entity11 pointed out that , for instance , among @entity77 teenagers , the unemployment rate is a staggering 43 %			1
now , you can spin a statistic like that one of two ways			0
you can say these unemployed black teenagers are helpless victims and the system is working against them			2
or you can say that many of these teenagers are unemployable because no one ever taught them the skills necessary to hold down a job			0
@entity11 thinks government should have a hand in creating a " pathway to work " so " people get in the work habit and learn the skills to be successful			1
politicians do n't usually speak this way , which is why so many of them have mastered the art of talking for hours without saying anything of importance			1
i ca n't imagine @entity104 saying these things ; he 's too busy telling people what they want to hear to tell them what they need to hear			2
this subject is as important as they come , and @entity11 deserves credit for kicking off the discussion , especially since he was sure to be pummeled for stating the obvious			1
here 's the obvious : @entity43 have lost their work ethic , and some never had one to lose			1
they grow up -- or put more precisely , they 're raised -- thinking of so many jobs as beneath them that they wake up one day not knowing how to do any job			0
@entity11 was right on the money			2
but i would go further than he did			0
this is n't just a problem for black @entity43 ; it 's a problem for all @entity43			0
in fact , as someone who speaks to groups all over the country and who spends a fair amount of time visiting high schools and colleges , i worry less about students from poor families who lack resources and opportunities than i do about those from the upper - middle class who lack passion and purpose			1
poor kids often have a fire in their belly , a desire to improve their lot and help their parents			1
upper - middle class kids can be harder to motivate , especially if they 've never been taught to work by their parents			2
you think i 'm kidding			0
i remember once seeing a 21 - year - old struggle with how to hold a broom and sweep the floor			0
it was n't his fault			0
no one had ever taught him how to do that chore -- or any other			0
whenever i write about young people and the jobs they wo n't do , i hear from dozens of employers with stories of their own			2
the common theme in all those e-mails is that we 've been too soft on our kids and have n't demanded enough from them , something we hardly notice because we 've allowed illegal immigrants to pick up the slack			2
parents used to make their children work after school , or on weekends , or during summer break , to earn extra money to buy what they wanted			0
they gave them a list of chores to do to earn their allowances			0
no chores , no allowances			0
today , parents find it easier to skip the chores and buy their kids what they want , which is no good for anyone and no good for society			0
you know what is good ? this conversation , and others like it			0
no subject this important should be off limits			0
after all , how do we fix a problem if it is considered taboo to even mention it ? @entity3 had the courage to mention the problem of @entity43 's vanishing work ethic , and emphasize the need to restore it			1
and for that , @entity43 should be thankful			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208			2

@entity3 said poor teens do n't see people working so do n't learn work habits
we have lost our work ethic , @entity208 says . not just poor kids : *richer* kids lack purpose
@entity208 : @entity11 got in *hot* water talking about it , but it should not be a taboo subject
