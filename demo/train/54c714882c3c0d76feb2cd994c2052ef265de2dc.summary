-- " the fastest man in rugby " could soon be showing his sprinting skills in the @entity3 after the @entity4 signed @entity6 sevens international @entity7			1
isles was a college sprinter in the 60 meters at @entity12 and has completed the 40 - yard dash in under 4.3 seconds			1
his fastest 100m time of 10.13s would have qualified for the semifinals at the @entity16			0
a winger in rugby , he will be a wide receiver in the @entity4 ' practice squad			1
the 24 - year - old , who took up rugby in 2012 , was given his chance following a trial after tight end @entity24 was promoted to the @entity4 ' active roster			1
" if you want to develop one of those guys you have to give some guys a chance here or there and this was an opportunity to be able to do that because of the way our roster is and bringing some of the guys up that we have , we have a spot open , " @entity4 coach @entity26 told the @entity3 's team website			1
the move does not mean @entity10 will pack in rugby altogether as he confirmed on his official @entity43 account that he will be taking part in the next round of the @entity46 in @entity47 on january 24 - 26			2
" @entity49 is quite similar to @entity50 , " @entity48 told @entity0 's @entity49 show last month			0
" besides the blocking and no pads , the tackling is similar			0
but @entity6 football you 've got breaks -- rugby , you do n't have no breaks , you 've got to keep running and running			1
" @entity48 , who played gridiron at high school and college in @entity62 before becoming a professional athlete , is n't the first player from another sport to attempt the transition			0
@entity67 gave former rugby union player @entity68 two games earlier this year , while @entity70 , a discus thrower at the @entity16 , is on the books of the @entity73			2
" he 's a legit track guy , " said @entity26 of @entity10			0
" i mean , his background happened to be rugby , but it 's probably more track and that speed -- that 's not unusual at all to see track athletes get chances			2
" and the @entity4 coach is confident @entity10 can successfully make the switch			1
" an athlete 's an athlete , " said @entity26			0
" there are skills that you can develop , and if you see something you like then you can work with him			0
" i think our personnel department does a really good job of searching that			0
there 's a lot of layers to stuff like that , but whether it 's a rugby player or a basketball player , if they can bring something to the table that is unique and make it worth working with them then we 're open to it			2
" the @entity4 are looking to improve next year after a disappointing campaign in which the team has dropped from a 6 - 3 record to 7 - 8 ahead of this weekend 's regular - season finale against @entity107 .			1
