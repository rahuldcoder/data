-- a ball has n't been kicked yet , but have we seen the @entity4 's first own goal ? football fans around the world have been having their say on social media after @entity9 announced the results of a slogan competition run by @entity13 car company @entity12 , one of the tournament 's sponsors			1
the " winning slogans , " which will be emblazoned on team buses for the month - long event , are anything but in some fans ' eyes			1
news that the @entity25 team bus will wear the words " @entity27 : @entity29 ! " was met with derision			1
" whose mum came up with that ultra cheesy slogan ? " read one tweet			0
@entity35 ceo @entity34 took an equally dim view of it as the country 's 30 - man preliminary squad for @entity41 was announced			1
" do n't worry too much about the other slogans that you might have read about			0
just say , ' go you @entity27 , ' " @entity34 said , the @entity25 reported			1
other national teams ' nicknames have been put to better use , with @entity48 's slogan perhaps being the highlight			0
the quarterfinalists in @entity51 four years ago will travel in a bus bearing the phrase , " @entity48 : here to illuminate @entity41 , " while @entity55 's slogan , " elephants charging towards @entity41 ! " also has some fun with the team 's alias			1
other teams , however , will have to make do with more enigmatic messages			0
one of the tournament favorites , @entity65 , wo n't win any prizes for " not just a team , we are a country , " and nor will 2006 champions @entity68 with " let 's paint the @entity4 dream blue			1
" the @entity73 stick with the motoring theme with " @entity75 , @entity76 , " while @entity78 fans will hope the slogan " @entity80 " can help steer the @entity81 all the way this time around after losing to @entity83 -- " inside our hearts , the passion of a champion " -- in the 2010 final			2
" in principle , at least , it was a good idea to run this competition ... but quite how significant and far - reaching having a slogan on the side of a bus is a moot point , " @entity88 , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at the @entity91 's @entity90 , told @entity0			1
" right now in sponsorship , and football generally , there is a big emphasis on fan engagement -- trying to get the fans as close as you possibly can to having an association with the sponsorship deal you are involved in , " he told @entity0			0
" effectively what you 've got here is a collective view of what your country brand stands for			0
by using these slogans you are positioning your country as a brand in a particular way			0
" so , if you look at @entity119 for example -- ' heroes play like @entity119 ' -- you 're then into @entity121 , ( being ) resolute , and that works very , very well , and @entity123 -- " samurai , the time has come to fight ! " these are , in many ways , all very good positioning statements or very good brand slogans			2
" but @entity88 has some sympathy for @entity34 and the @entity25 team			1
" how is it that a commercial partner of @entity9 rather than the football association itself decided what would be on the side of the bus ? " he says			2
" i think there is a broader issue about corporate influence on the @entity4 and on football in this			2
" it 's an issue about joined - up thinking			0
i can understand why @entity9 has done this , but i do n't think you can do it without involving the national association as well			2
" here 's the list in full			0
let us know what you think			0
