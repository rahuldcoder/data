-- each fall we return to our beloved tvs , ready for the favorites to ease into an autumnal slump while new series fight for a spot on our dvr			2
september sees the list filled up to about 70 % , but that number dwindles as the season wears on			2
by the time winter finales are upon us , less than a quarter of the shows we committed to are left standing			2
gone are the programs we were rooting for , cast aside in favor of old favorites like " @entity21 " reruns on @entity20			1
everyone 's going to give you the scoop on new fall shows , but we 'd like to predict what will survive based on a good old - fashioned hunch			1
why ? because we 've watched far too much television in our time to sit idly by while our fellow viewers flip aimlessly between the networks			2
you can thank us later			2
" @entity33 " ( @entity34 ) -- written by " @entity21 " producer @entity36 and comedienne @entity37 , this sitcom stars @entity38 and @entity39 as a modern - day " @entity41			1
" @entity42 ( @entity38 ) is a mouthy @entity43 waitress who also works as a nanny			2
( how we miss @entity45 and scraping to make ends meet			2
) her new co-worker , @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , is an heiress whose father is serving time for his involvement in a @entity52 ( too soon ? )			0
@entity47 is now " broke , " and forced to move in with @entity53 sounds like a predictable premise , but here 's hoping that both the writing and comedic timing is good enough to make up for the tired formula			1
" @entity59 " ( @entity60 ) -- this little gem of a throwback , starring @entity63 , reminds us of what flying once was			1
way before passengers were hauled off to airplane jail for not turning their phones off , travel was a privilege -- nay -- a joy			0
we 'll get an all - access look at the glamorous lives of @entity59 's flight attendants , the prom queens of the jet - setting golden age			1
" @entity77 " ( @entity78 ) -- we can not wait for this comedy , and pray to the gods of network heaven that it 's a success			1
you 've seen a few previews here and there of @entity86 and @entity87 turning on each other after having their first baby			1
relax , their relationship is n't in jeopardy			0
they 're just new parents ! @entity86 + @entity87 + @entity94 and a baby = the second coming of " @entity97 ? " yes ? no ? " @entity98 " ( @entity60 ) -- @entity99 and @entity100 star in this magical series about a town in @entity103 populated with characters ( like @entity105 ) who have no recollection of their true identities			1
we are going to be straightforward with you : this program , which tells dual stories set in present day and in fairy tale land , confuses the dust out of us			0
no matter , we 'll be tuning in to see how it all unfolds			0
" @entity116 " ( @entity117 ) -- produced by @entity118 , " @entity116 " sounds like a tv version of " @entity120 , " which is fine by us			0
the drama focuses on the @entity124 family , who travel back to prehistoric @entity125 to save humanity			0
dinosaurs both good and bad will cross paths with the @entity129 , and we 've been promised some dinosaur vs. man action			0
" @entity132 " ( @entity60 ) -- call us old - fashioned , but nothing gives us greater pleasure than to welcome @entity135 back to @entity136			1
how we miss watching the father - son camaraderie between @entity135 and his three boys on " @entity139			0
" it 's 20 years later and @entity141 has come home , this time to star as @entity143 , a " manly married man " with three girls			1
@entity141 said at this summer 's @entity146 tour in @entity147 that he was pitched a number of television ideas , but refused to stray from the " @entity139 " concept			1
he explained to @entity151 that " i just really wanted to investigate what it would be like to be around four women who are intelligent and strong			0
and i thought it would be kind of fun , literally , to flip - flop ' @entity139			0
' it is n't rocket science what i 'm doing			0
" the sitcom also stars @entity161 as @entity141 's wife and @entity163 as his boss			1
we 're curious to know which shows you 'll be tuning into this fall season			0
