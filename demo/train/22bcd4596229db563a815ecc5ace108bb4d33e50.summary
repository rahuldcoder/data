-- president @entity1 has decided to move ahead with a variety of gun control measures , and sen. @entity4 has proposed a new assault weapons ban			1
while @entity7 debates new proposals on gun control , attention also needs to focus on obstacles to effective enforcement of existing gun laws , including the ban imposed by @entity14 on the @entity15 creating a federal database of firearms transactions			1
a discussion of the origin of that ban , which was initially enacted in response to a proposal made when i served as the assistant treasury secretary overseeing the bureau , is useful to a better understanding of the dynamics of the debate over specific gun control proposals			1
sadly , both then and now , logic often loses out			0
early in 1978 , the proposal we developed was relatively simple : manufacturers , wholesalers and retailers would file reports of sales of firearms with the bureau , but to avoid the argument that the bureau was impermissibly creating a national registry of gun owners , retailers would not be required to list the name of the retail purchaser			1
the rationale for creating a centralized firearms transaction database was twofold			1
first , it would speed up the ability to trace guns found at crime scenes , since even with the less sophisticated technology then available , such traces would still be able to be done virtually instantaneously			0
gun control advocates march as nation reels from school shootings second , and even more significant , it would allow the bureau to analyze the flow of firearms to identify potential diversions to the illegal gun market			1
for example , if a hundred handguns a week were going to one dealer in a small town in @entity66 , that would suggest the possibility that guns were being sold illegally by that dealer to individuals smuggling them to @entity71 or other states			0
by allowing this kind of analysis , the bureau could target investigative resources on dealers mostly likely to be violating the law			0
proceeding with what can only be described as youthful @entity82 © , the day the proposed regulations were published , i convened a briefing for interested parties , including the @entity86 and other anti-gun control groups			1
after all , none of these proposals would in any way alter the rules relating to gun ownership			2
the hope was that understanding the limited nature of the proposal would mute their opposition			2
we had to withdraw the proposals , and @entity14 punitively reduced the bureau 's budget and ultimately banned it from creating such firearms transaction databases			1
the opposition to the proposed regulations was intense , with opponents writing hundreds of thousands of often angry letters , both to @entity107 and to members of @entity14			2
@entity109 of the opposition , however , focused on the actual proposals themselves			2
one common thread to the opposition was the " slippery slope argument , " which argued that the regulation would create a centralized list of all gun owners ' names -- which it would not have done -- or would lead to the creation of such a list , which would then enable the government to seize everyone 's weapons and put us on a path to dictatorship			1
gun violence measures ? would they work ? after all , it was argued , this is what the @entity133 had done			0
another often - used argument was that what we were proposing would not stop all criminals from securing or using firearms , and therefore it was not something worth doing			0
arguments like these prevent an honest discussion of any proposal to address the problem of gun violence in @entity148			0
the assumption that any regulation of firearms sets us on the path to confiscation of weapons is not only ludicrous on its face , it ignores all political reality			0
and , if the test for any proposal is whether it totally solves the problem being addressed , then no action would be taken addressing so many of society 's important issues			0
why require the use of seat belts if wearing a seat belt does not always save a life in an accident ? why prohibit people from carrying guns onto planes if it does n't eliminate all risk of hijacking ? why prohibit providing assistance to terrorists if it does n't stop all terrorist acts ? why require tests for the issuance of driver 's licenses if it does n't stop all accidents ? we require these regulations because they address problems that need to be addressed and because if these regulations can save some lives , they are steps worth taking			1
so it should be with the gun debate			0
no proposal , or set of proposals , will ever stop all gun crime			2
but the 1978 proposals could have stopped some illegal sales of guns by renegade dealers			0
and things like forced waiting periods for gun purchases , requiring background checks for firearms buyers at gun shows and a ban on assault weapons would certainly save some lives			0
@entity86 chief : @entity1 makes ' mockery ' of @entity148 freedoms maybe it is thousands of lives over time ; maybe it is hundreds			0
but is n't every life saved worth it ? would it not have been worth it if even some of the lives lost at @entity222 could have been saved because the shooter did not have an assault weapon ? gun control is not the total answer to the problem of mass shootings , but it plainly needs to be part of any meaningful response			1
let 's hope that this time the debate on gun control will be a more sensible one			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			2

@entity237 : modest gun control proposals become focus of attacks
he served in @entity245 administration , proposed firearm transaction database
even though plan would n't have listed gun owners , it was *quickly* *shelved* , he says
@entity237 : let 's make sure reasonable steps do n't fall *victim* to irrational opposition
