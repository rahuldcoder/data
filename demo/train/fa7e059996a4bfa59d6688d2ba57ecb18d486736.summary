@entity0 -- a top @entity3 aide and the managing director of oil giant @entity5 provided differing versions sunday for who provided the initial inaccurate estimates of the size of the @entity11 oil spill			1
@entity12 , the @entity5 official who appeared on @entity1 's " @entity13 " and other talk shows , said early estimates that 5,000 barrels ( 210,000 gallons ) were leaking into the ocean each day came from government satellite imaging , rather than @entity5 's figures			1
an updated estimate issued last week by a government - led team put the leak at 12,000 - 19,000 barrels ( 504,000 to 798,000 gallons ) a day , more than double the initial figure			1
" the best way to measure those early rates or estimate those early rates were from satellite data , not @entity5 data , " @entity12 said on the @entity25 program " @entity26			1
" not true , countered @entity32 , the assistant on energy and climate change to president @entity35 , who spoke to the @entity37 program " @entity39 " and the @entity25 show			2
" the very , very first estimates came from @entity5 , " @entity32 said on the @entity25 program			1
" they had the footage of the plume			0
the government then did satellite imagery and we realized that those estimates were not accurate			1
" @entity32 noted that @entity5 had a " vested financial interest " in downplaying the size of the leak			1
" they will ultimately pay a fine based on those rates , " @entity32 said			2
" that 's why we brought in an independent team			0
we did not include @entity5 in the estimates that were made available this week			1
" rep. @entity58 of @entity59 , who heads the @entity61 subcommittee , agreed that the company " had a stake in low - balling the number right from the very beginning			0
" " i think that they were either lying or they were incompetent , " @entity58 said on the @entity25 program			0
noting that @entity5 has consistently provided information that proved to be wrong , @entity58 said he had " no confidence whatsoever in @entity5			2
" " i think they do not know what they are doing , " @entity58 said , adding : " i do n't think that people should really believe what @entity5 is saying in terms of the likelihood of anything that they 're doing is going to turn out as they 're predicting			2
" @entity32 emphasized steps the government has taken to oversee @entity5 's efforts to stop the leak , noting the administration ordered the company to begin digging two relief wells intended to eventually stop the leak instead of a single one proposed by @entity5			1
in addition , she said , it was government scientists led by energy secretary @entity91 who recommended that @entity5 halt the so - called " top kill " effort to pump heavy mud down the well to try to plug the leak			1
" it was that group of people yesterday who looked at the information we had gotten from ' top kill ' and realized that it was too dangerous to continue to proceed to put pressure down into that well , that things could happen that would make the situation worse , " @entity32 said			2
@entity12 told @entity1 that @entity5 was " disappointed the oil is going to flow for a while and we 're going to redouble our efforts to keep it off the beaches			2
" the top kill effort failed because " there was just too much flow " of oil and gas coming out of the well , @entity12 said			0
he detailed a plan to cut a new opening in equipment from which the oil is leaking to try to lower a cap over it and pipe up most of the leak			0
a similar previous effort failed , and @entity12 said steps would be taken to prevent the problems from the first attempt			0
" our objective is to contain a majority of the oil and gas , " @entity12 said , adding that cutting the new opening was unlikely to increase the amount of oil leaking out before the cap is placed			0
@entity32 , however , said on the @entity25 program that an increase of up to 20 percent was possible			0
and @entity58 , on the same show , contended that @entity5 " has been making it up as they go along the whole way			0
" they do not know for sure what the result is going to be of anything which they are doing , " @entity58 said .			0

@entity3 aide , @entity5 official differ on who gave initial estimates on size of leak
@entity32 says @entity5 had financial incentive to downplay size of leak
@entity5 official says estimate figures came from government satellite imaging
