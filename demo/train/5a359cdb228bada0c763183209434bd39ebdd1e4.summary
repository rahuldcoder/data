@entity0 , @entity1 -- former @entity4 prime minister @entity3 says he would have taken the decision to remove @entity6 even without evidence of weapons of mass destruction in @entity9			1
in an excerpt from a @entity12 interview to be aired sunday , @entity3 said : " i would still have thought it right to remove him			1
i mean obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments , about the nature of the threat			0
" @entity3 , who left office in 2007 and now serves as a special envoy to the @entity21 , will be questioned next year at an inquiry into @entity4 's role in the 2003 conflict			1
at the time of the conflict the @entity4 government based its decision to go to war on evidence , contained within a dossier it published in september 2002 , that @entity6 had weapons of mass destruction ( @entity35 ) ready to deploy within 45 minutes			1
but critics of the war claim the @entity38 administration had decided to remove the @entity9 dictator by force by the end of 2002 and that @entity3 was aware of this and had offered his support			1
the current inquiry is not a court of law , so it can not find anyone criminally responsible or even apportion blame			0
but inquiry members will be able to judge the legality of the conflict			2
despite doubts about @entity9 's wmds , @entity3 was defiant about the need for regime change in @entity56 for the sake of peace in the region			1
he told the @entity12 : " i ca n't really think we 'd be better with him and his two sons still in charge , but it 's incredibly difficult and i totally understand			1
" that 's why i sympathize with the people who were against [ the war ] for perfectly good reasons and are against it now , but for me , you know , in the end i had to take the decision			2
" it was the notion of him as a threat to the region , of which the development of @entity35 was obviously one			0
he used chemical weapons on his own people , so this was obviously the thing that was uppermost in my mind			0
" last month , @entity3 denied a claims that @entity84 , @entity4 's attorney general at the time of the @entity9 war , was " bullied " into declaring that the invasion was legal			1
according to reports in the @entity4 media , @entity88 warned @entity3 the invasion was a serious breach of international law in an " uncompromising letter " in july 2002 , eight months before the campaign			2
in an interview with @entity2 , the former premier refuted the claim but accepted his reputation had been called into question many times over @entity9			2
" over the years i 've answered questions time and time again about it [ the invasion ] and am happy to do so again , " he said			0
" it was an important decision , and it was a momentous decision in terms of your country and in terms of mine			0
" but one of the things you learn as leader of a country is that you have the responsibility to take decisions			0
some of those decisions are difficult decisions and some are very controversial ... sometimes they can be very bitter , very difficult			0
that 's part of being a leader			0
" @entity4 has already held four hearings about the @entity9 war			1
but because all were held before the end of 2004 -- so close to the start of the war -- they were hampered by limited information , political analyst @entity124 of @entity126 told @entity2			0
" they did n't manage to achieve anything like a comprehensive understanding of the paths that led the @entity4 to support the @entity135 in the invasion , " he said			0
" this will be the first to look at political decision - making that led to the @entity4 invasion of 2003 , with the potential to tell a full story			2
" @entity4 's first two inquiries were held by government committees in 2003			1
the @entity144 examined whether @entity4 's @entity145 gave accurate and complete information to @entity147 in the run - up to the war			2
it found the government exerted no improper influence on the drafting of the dossier given to @entity147 on @entity9 's alleged weapons of mass destruction			1
the @entity157 then examined whether intelligence about @entity9 and its weapons was properly assessed and accurately reflected in government publications			2
the next two inquiries had narrow mandates , looking at specific aspects of the war			0
the @entity167 report from january 2004 investigated the death of @entity169 , a leading microbiologist and former @entity171 weapons inspector who committed suicide months earlier			0
@entity169 had worked for the @entity4 @entity173 , advising it on @entity9 's weapons of mass destruction , but was later found to be the source of a @entity12 report that said the government had exaggerated evidence to justify war on @entity9			1
following that came the @entity183 inquiry , which looked at the accuracy of intelligence on weapons of mass destruction in @entity9 and elsewhere			1
it found some of the intelligence sources were " seriously flawed , " but that there was no evidence of deliberate distortion or culpable negligence by spy agencies .			0

former @entity4 pm @entity3 tells @entity12 it was right to remove @entity6 , sons from @entity9
@entity3 faces a @entity4 inquiry into the country 's role in the 2003 conflict
@entity4 based its decision to go to war on evidence @entity6 had weapons of mass destruction
critics argue @entity3 government had exaggerated evidence to justify war on @entity9
