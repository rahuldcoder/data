-- a key part of the law banning federal recognition of same - sex marriage was struck down as unconstitutional by a @entity6 appeals court thursday			1
the @entity7 -- known as @entity7 -- defines marriage for federal purposes as unions exclusively between a man and woman			2
same - sex couples find their stride on wedding day at issue is whether the federal government can deny tax , health and pension benefits to same - sex couples in states where they can legally marry			1
the ruling is a boost for gay rights advocates and the @entity28 administration , which in a rare move , has refused to defend a federal law in court			1
" if we are right in thinking that disparate impact on minority interests and federalism concerns both require somewhat more in this case than almost automatic deference to @entity41 ' will , this statute fails that test , " said the three judge panel			1
same - sex marriage fast facts the 1st @entity45 , based in @entity46 , did not rule on the federal law 's other key provision : that states that do not allow same - sex marriages can not be forced to recognize such unions performed in other states			1
traditionally , marriages in one jurisdiction are considered valid across the country			0
@entity7 was enacted in 1996 , when @entity56 was considering legalizing same - sex marriage			0
marriage between two males or two females is legal in the @entity61 and six states -- @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			0
it is set to become legal in @entity70 next week and in @entity71 in january , but in each state the implementation could be delayed by opponents placing the question on the november ballot			1
many other states have legalized domestic partnerships and civil unions for such couples , including @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity56 , a step designed in most cases to provide the same rights of marriage under state law			1
but other states have passed laws or state constitutional amendments banning such marriages			1
lesbian couple can file for divorce in @entity71 , court rules the appeals court said it recognizes how divisive the issue is , and noted it may ultimately be up to the @entity99 to decide			1
but this decision is the first at this judicial stage to find the heart of the law unconstitutional			0
" many @entity6 believe that marriage is the union of a man and a woman , and most @entity6 live in states where that is the law today , " said judge @entity105 , appointed to the bench in 1992 by president @entity107			1
" one virtue of federalism is that it permits this diversity of governance based on local choice , but this applies as well to the states that have chosen to legalize same - sex marriage			0
under current @entity99 authority , @entity41 ' denial of federal benefits to same - sex couples lawfully married in @entity63 has not been adequately supported by any permissible federal interest			1
" chief judge @entity127 , a @entity129 nominee , and judge @entity130 , a @entity131 nominee , joined in the opinion			0
it is in effect only within states with gay marriage laws covered by the @entity137 -- @entity63 and @entity67 -- and has limited enforcement			0
that means there will be no immediate eligibility for financial benefits currently denied same - sex married couples			1
no change is likely until the high court decides the matter			0
@entity63 had challenged @entity148 of the law on behalf of a group of seven couples			0
similar lawsuits have been filed across the country			0
couples challenge @entity82 law denying same - sex marriage @entity7 is being officially defended in court by @entity158 , led by speaker @entity159 , @entity160 , who stepped in after the @entity161 refused to participate			1
the @entity28 administration announced last year it believed the law to be unconstitutional			1
a bill known as the @entity165 is working its way through @entity41 and would repeal @entity7			0
congressional opponents of @entity7 hailed the court 's opinion			1
" it 's very good new for those who are fighting discrimination in any place , including in the area of marriage equality , " said @entity171 minority leader @entity170 , @entity172			0
the case was argued in @entity46 last month			0
the lawyer for the couples said states have long - standing authority to control and define marriage , and that @entity41 has no right to intervene through @entity7 , clearly designed , said the lawyer , as " disrespect " to lesbians and gays			0
but @entity190 , the private attorney hired by @entity159 to defend the law , argued a congressionally mandated , uniform standard to define marriage for federal purposes is both proper and practical			2
@entity28 calls for marriage equality , says ' i want everyone to be treated fairly ' groups fighting @entity7 were ecstatic at the decision			2
" all @entity63 couples should be afforded the same rights and protections under the law , and we hope that this decision will be the final step toward ensuring that equality for all , " said the state 's attorney general , @entity207 , who in 2009 filed the initial lawsuit challenging @entity7			2
" as more loving same - sex couples commit their lives to one another in marriage , the harms of this unjust law become more clear , " said @entity211 , president of @entity212 , " from service members , risking their lives to protect ours , being denied the ability to protect their own families through military medical insurance or survivor benefits , to senior citizens having to move out of their homes after their partners of many decades pass on because they can not access @entity230 protections afforded any other legally married couple			1
" there was no immediate reaction from @entity159 or the @entity234 in the @entity171			0
but gay marriage opponents expressed confidence the @entity99 would eventually reverse the ruling			2
" @entity240 should protect and strengthen marriage , not undermine it , " said @entity239 legal counsel @entity238			0
" in allowing one state to hold the federal government , and potentially other states , hostage to redefine marriage , the @entity137 attempts a bridge too far			2
under this rationale , if just one state decided to accept polygamy , the federal government and perhaps other states would be forced to accept it , too			2
" the issue has been working along two legal tracks			2
a federal appeals court earlier this month ruled against @entity172 's voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage , arguing the ban unconstitutionally singles out gays and lesbians for discrimination			1
in a split decision , a three - judge panel of the 9th @entity263 found the state 's @entity267 " works a meaningful harm to gays and lesbians " by denying their right to civil marriage in violation of the 14th amendment			1
both the @entity172 and @entity63 cases could soon be presented to the @entity6 @entity99 for review			2
the justices would have the discretion to accept one , both , or neither case -- perhaps deferring judicial review until a later time , after more lower courts have had time to debate the matter			0
the case is @entity63 v. @entity287 ( 10 - 2204 ) .			0

at issue is whether federal benefits can be denied in marriages legal under state law
a three - judge panel of a federal appeals court says no
the appeals court notes it may ultimately be up to the @entity99 to decide
the law is being defended by congressional *republicans* , not the @entity28 administration
