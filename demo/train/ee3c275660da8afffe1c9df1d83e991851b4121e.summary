-- they say that to succeed in politics , you need a thick skin , and nowhere is that more true than in @entity5 in the run up to the country 's long - awaited independence referendum			1
with just a week to go before @entity5 go to the polls to decide whether to break away from the rest of the @entity11 , the debate is gearing up across the country -- in pubs and shops , on the street , tv and , of course , online			1
most political campaigns become a little bad - tempered at times , but when the stakes are this high , and the discourse goes from sniping to downright nasty and even violent , things can get tough			1
even hardened political heavyweights are n't immune : a televised debate between @entity5 's first minister @entity26 , of the " yes " camp , and former @entity11 finance minister @entity28 , of the " @entity30 " campaign , descended into shrillness , name - calling and finger - pointing			1
and the bitterness is n't just confined to the airwaves , tv studios and newspapers			0
pro-union @entity39 mp @entity38 found himself on the receiving end of some real - world nastiness when he was pelted with eggs during his " @entity44 " campaign trip			1
" what started as individual passionate @entity47 having their say has changed into angry mobs coming along to make sure no one else has their say , " he explained in a statement			0
" this is not about someone throwing an egg -- that 's part of the sometimes messy pantomime of politics , " he said , accusing the " yes " campaign of " organizing a mob atmosphere at our street meetings			1
it 's coordinated , determined and increasingly aggressive			2
" concerned at the angry turn things had taken , @entity38 temporarily suspended his tour around the country , insisting that his political opponents " call off their mobs " before restarting his campaign days later			2
@entity71 leader @entity26 and the @entity73 campaign both condemned the egg attack			1
it is in cyberspace where things have really degenerated			0
@entity78 , the @entity79 , said he was worried that not everyone was managing to keep their tempers under control , and bemoaned the actions of a disproportionate and rancorous " tiny minority " online which he said was drowning out the more moderate majority			0
" i fear that something ugly may be beginning to permeate the independence debate , " he said , echoing earlier comments to the @entity89 that he was " disturbed by apparent increased aggression and bitterness " as the referendum date approaches			2
in one of the most high - profile cases , @entity95 , a fire safety technician from @entity98 's @entity97 , was convicted of " behaving in a threatening manner " towards @entity26 on @entity102			1
@entity95 had posted " think i might assassinate @entity26 , " while watching a tv program about the @entity71 leader and figurehead of the " yes " campaign			2
after protesting in court that his outburst was meant as a joke , @entity95 had his sentence deferred for a year for good behavior			0
but it 's not just politicians who 've found themselves the target of online " trolls " : @entity117 author @entity116 earned the wrath of " yes " supporters in june this year after she donated Â £ 1 million ( $ 1.61 million ) to the " @entity30 " campaign			1
@entity121 ( @ @entity122 ) tweeted : " i 've waited all my life for this			0
i do n't want @entity125 scuppered by a selfish narrow - minded little @entity126 " @entity5 's charity watchdog the @entity127 launched an investigation into @entity130 after a message posted on its @entity102 feed ( since shut down ) abusing the writer : " what a # bitch after we gave her shelter in our city when she was a single mum			1
" the charity , which works with vulnerable children in @entity141 , later issued a statement insisting the account -- which it had thought to be " obsolete and dormant " had been hacked by someone " to satisfy and externalize their own frustration and inner anger			0
" @entity116 , who was born in @entity148 but has lived in @entity149 since the mid- 1990s , was well aware her decision to go public about how she planned to vote in the referendum could open her up to abuse			0
in a blog post announcing her decision , she admitted it could make her unpopular with the " fringe of nationalists who like to demonize anyone who is not blindly and unquestionably pro-independence , " and said she feared that some " @entity160 " voters " might judge me ' insufficiently @entity5 ' to have a valid view			2
" indeed , @entity102 has been a hotbed for some of the worst of the trolling , particularly , some in the media assert , by so - called " cybernats , " the pejorative term for the " yes " campaign 's vociferous online commentariat			1
outspoken @entity5 comedian and " yes " supporter @entity170 has been ever - present on @entity102 ( crude language ) , adding a sometimes intelligent , sometimes surreal voice to the debate			1
" @entity175 might be a step into the unknown but the known is foodbanks ; @entity179 ( the @entity11 's nuclear submarine deterrent ) ; a ( privatized ) @entity181 ; bedroom tax and exploding @entity184 badgers , " he tweeted			0
the war for votes has seen tweeting and counter-tweeting flourish , as both sides scrap for every advantage			0
online blogs , such as the pro-independence wings over @entity5 , have come under fire for divisive commentary			2
one piece which attacked @entity195 ( @entity197 ) @entity196 provoked outrage from the " no " camp			0
the politician told @entity202 news : " the kind of attack that was conducted on the wings over @entity5 site is the kind of thing that 's designed to intimidate ; it 's designed to bully people into not expressing their genuinely held views			1
we ca n't allow that to happen			0
" the site 's creator , @entity212 , responded : " it 's the only time we 've ever just insulted someone on the website			0
i think it was entirely justified			0
" as always , though , the insults can go both ways ; a sarcastic piece from conservative news site @entity223 's @entity222 wing brought howls of outrage , not least in its own comment section			0
the article , which asserted that @entity5 " is more commonly associated with work - shy dole scroungers and skag - addled prostitutes than with the industriousness of @entity232 or with its glorious @entity234 spirituality , " suggested that independence might be a good thing , if only to rid the rest of the @entity11 of their " scrounging @entity239 neighbors			1
" but while some on both sides tear metaphorical strips off each other in the days leading up to the all - important poll , others have added a lighter note to the campaign , pillorying an ad from the " @entity30 " campaign , which detractors saw as sexist			1
a # @entity253 hashtag and attendant slew of memes , and even a reply video ( containing some profanity ) soon popped up			0
it 's not all bad news though : some campaigners have recruited animals -- the undisputed stars of the internet -- to their cause , hoping that cuteness , rather than insults , will be enough to win voters over by polling day			2

a week out from @entity5 's independence vote , the debate getting heated
" @entity274 " have been accused of *debasing* the campaign for independence
more *traditional* bad - tempered *tactics* , like egg - throwing , have also been employed
supporters on both sides of the debate have been targeted by @entity102 trolls
