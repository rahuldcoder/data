-- seventy - two bodies discovered at a ranch in northeast @entity2 belonged to migrants who were making their way toward the @entity7 , @entity2 officials said wednesday			1
the preliminary investigation indicates the victims were illegal immigrants from @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , said @entity14 , spokesman for national security strategy			1
the motive for the killings was under investigation , though officials pointed out that @entity2 's drug cartels have expanded their activities to include extortion and kidnapping of immigrants			1
" @entity2 institutions have hit the operational structures of these criminals and their income , and because of that , they turn to extortion and kidnapping of migrants , as well as recruiting them to force them to become part of their group of hit men , " @entity14 said			1
the bodies of the 58 men and 14 women were found above ground in a structure on the ranch , which is about 14 miles ( 22 kilometers ) from the town of @entity44 , near the border with @entity46			1
the @entity2 navy , which was called in to investigate the case , said it is one of the largest discoveries of bodies in @entity2 's 4 - year - old war on organized crime			1
members of the @entity2 navy were tipped off to the site after a man with a gunshot wound approached a military roadblock			1
the man said he had been injured by a criminal gang , according to a statement released by the navy			1
@entity2 's attorney general 's office identified the man as an @entity13 immigrant with a bullet wound to the neck			1
" the navy went to the area where the man came from and encountered gunfights			1
a naval officer was killed and three of the delinquents were killed , " said an officer who answered the telephone at the navy 's communication department			1
the officer , who was not authorized to speak on the record , declined to give his name			0
after the gunbattle , authorities said , they found a stash of weapons , including 21 rifles , camouflage uniforms , bulletproof vests and four trucks			2
one of the vehicles had been disguised to look like a truck from the @entity90 , officials said			2
" this discovery once again demonstrates the extreme danger and violence that @entity95 face on their treacherous journey north , as well as @entity2 authorities ' abject failure to protect them , " @entity91 said			2
" @entity2 must immediately investigate this massacre , bring the perpetrators to justice and establish the identities of those killed so that their families can be informed			1
" wednesday 's gruesome discovery came about a month after authorities in the neighboring state of @entity109 discovered 51 bodies in nine mass graves			0
in that instance , investigators found charred remains , incinerated bone fragments and stains of fire on the ground where bodies were presumably burned in steel drums , the state - run @entity113 news agency said			2
the bodies were mostly males between age 20 and 50 , @entity113 said			0
many of them had tattoos			0
similar mass graves have been discovered in the @entity2 states of @entity132 and @entity133 since late may			2
authorities have linked them to @entity2 's ongoing drug war			2
@entity109 and @entity137 , which border @entity46 , have seen a marked increase in drug violence this year due to an intensifying rivalry between the @entity142 cartel and the @entity144 gang , which was formerly the cartel 's armed branch			0
last week , authorities found the bound and blindfolded body of @entity147 , the mayor of a city in @entity109			0
he had been abducted two days earlier			0
his body was found on the outskirts of the city of @entity152 , where @entity153 was mayor			0
there were signs of torture			0
news reports indicate that officials believe the @entity144 ordered @entity153 killed			2
five police officers and a transit worker were arrested last week in connection with the slaying			0
more than 28,000 people have died in drug - related incidents since president @entity165 intensified the government 's fight against drug cartels and organized crime after taking office in december 2006			0
about 90 percent of the fatalities have been among cartel members and other criminals , @entity165 has said			0
@entity0 's @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
