-- @entity1 may have arrived into the world 10 minutes after twin brother @entity3 but he was first when it really mattered in @entity5 , as the 27 - year - old led home a famous @entity8 1 - 2 - 3 in the men 's 500m speed skating on day three of the @entity11			1
with @entity3 taking the bronze , the @entity12 became the first twins to medal in the same individual @entity17 event since @entity19 duo @entity18 and @entity20 in @entity21 in 1984			1
there was considerable confusion at the finish as @entity25 , who took silver , raised his hands in triumph at the line -- only to eventually by beaten by just one hundredth of a second			2
" i just did n't know , " @entity1 told reporters			2
" then i saw that i had won and i could n't believe it			2
" while @entity1 screamed in delight , @entity25 struggled to explain the pain of having gold snatched from his grasp			0
" it was a kick in the gut , " said a man who initially believed he had won the competition after the scoreboard briefly showed him on top			1
" i was so ecstatic that i won , i ca n't describe it			0
" however , the official timings eventually readjusted to show that @entity46 had been beaten by 0.012 seconds			0
" i have never seen it in my career and i do n't think we will see it again , " @entity25 surmised			0
" i have to congratulate @entity1 and @entity51			0
i am proud of them , but the disappointment is overwhelming right now			0
" it 's silver and i have to be happy with it			0
maybe i will be in a couple of hours , days , years -- i do n't know			0
but now it 's really disappointing			0
" speed skating is decided by the fastest time registered by a competitor in two separate races and @entity1 started his second race 0.04 seconds behind @entity64			1
the fastest run of the day came from @entity3 , whose 34.49 seconds had shot him from sixth place into gold medal position until his younger brother pushed him out in the penultimate heat			1
defending champion @entity70 finished fourth as @entity71 , a major force in @entity17 speed skating in recent times , was forced off the podium			1
the @entity77 nation also failed to medal in the men 's 1500m short track even though @entity81 , who won three golds for @entity71 in the @entity11 , finished third			1
the problem for the country of his birth is that @entity81 , as he was once known , now competes for @entity87 , a nationality switch he pushed through three years ago			0
the race was won by @entity91 's @entity90 , who clinched his third @entity17 gold after previous triumphs in the 500m and 5000m relay in 2010			1
" it 's not my best distance but i had a really good start and was able to control the race afterwards , " said the 29 - year - old			2
the @entity8 ' clean sweet in the speed skating , an event where they have taken all three gold medals on offer so far , had enabled them to go top of the medals table midway through monday			1
but they were toppled by the @entity91 in the last event of the day as @entity109 became the first man to win back - to - back @entity17 moguls titles			1
with three gold medals apiece , @entity91 lead the @entity8 courtesy of having one more silver			1
@entity115 -- who had led going into the third and final event -- took that silver , meaning @entity91 's men matched their women 's achievements on saturday , when sisters @entity121 and @entity123 finished first and second			1
the 26 - year - old , who is retiring from the sport to concentrate on other ventures , thanked his compatriots after finishing his career in perfect style			2
" there were two other @entity91 after me			1
every day they push me in training and that 's why i got my best skiing tonight , " he said			0
" i 'm glad to finish my last olympics like this			0
it 's going to be a great retirement			0
" all - @entity140 monday could have belonged to @entity141 , the legendary @entity142 who won the 10km biathlon sprint on saturday to share the all - time record of 12 @entity17 medals with compatriot @entity147			1
competing in the biathlon pursuit , @entity141 just failed in his quest to become the most successful @entity151 of all time -- finishing fourth after his shooting was , quite literally , off target			1
the 40 - year - old finished just 1.7 seconds outside the medals in a contest won by @entity157 as @entity158 celebrated its first gold of the games			1
@entity141 's speed was good but he missed targets in the second prone and both standing shooting			2
" i think i had the chance to win			0
when i missed the shot , i knew that was the end for me , " said @entity141			0
" i was not strong enough on the shooting			0
" " on the final leg , i tried to speed up but i realized the competition was too strong and i should have done that earlier			1
" the biathlete has four move events to try to eclipse the retired @entity147 , 46 , whose medals all came in cross country skiing			2
the first gold of the day came in the super-combined gold , as @entity179 defended her @entity17 title with a total time of 2 minutes 34.62 seconds from her downhill and slalom runs			1
she finished four - tenths of a second ahead of @entity187 @entity186 and @entity19 favourite @entity188 , who led after the downhill			2
" @entity189 was steep at the start , which i found especially difficult			0
it did n't feel great , but i skied fast enough , " said @entity179 , 29			0
the 29 - year - old , who had been fifth in the standings prior to her slalom , sunk to her knees in celebration as @entity188 , the last woman who could catch her , was only fast enough for bronze .			2

@entity91 go top of the medals table after @entity109 defends moguls title
@entity205 brothers both medal as @entity8 clean up in 500m speed skating final
@entity209 fails in bid to become @entity11 ' most successful all - time @entity151
