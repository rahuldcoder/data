@entity0 -- the creator of the " @entity4 " television series accuses @entity5 of cheating him out of millions of dollars in profits from the zombie hit			1
@entity5 , which produces the series , allegedly charged its own cable network an " artificially low " license fee to carry the show , according to a lawsuit filed by @entity13 tuesday			1
" the sole goal of this sham transaction is to enhance the profits of the parent company by minimizing the revenues that go into the ' pool ' of funds for the show 's profit participants , " the complaint said			2
@entity13 worked for years to develop the television series from @entity26 's comic book series , the lawsuit said			1
it became a " monumental hit " for @entity5 when it debuted in 2010 , it said			2
" despite four seasons of unprecedented programming success and profitability for defendants , @entity13 has not received and may never receive one dollar in profits for developing the series , " the suit said			1
@entity13 , who wrote , directed and produced the first season , was fired by @entity5 during the second season			1

@entity13 's complaint points to the difference between the fee @entity5 charges its own company for each " @entity4 " episode compared to the license fee paid to a third party for the @entity5 series " @entity55 " as evidence of the company 's " improper and abusive practice of ' self - dealing			1
' " the " @entity55 " production company gets $ 3 million per episode from @entity5 , while the fee is just $ 1.45 million per " @entity4 " episode			1
the drama about a 1960s @entity62 ad agency draws just 25 % of the audience that the series about the survivors of a zombie apocalypse gets , the lawsuit said			0

the contract provides that they get a total of 20 % of the " @entity77 , " which is a pool of all the money brought in by the production with the production costs subtracted			0
" license fees can be manipulated , however , when the entity producing the show and the entity broadcasting it are controlled by the same parent company , or where the network owns and / or controls the production company , " the complaint said			0
after two years , the accounting claimed a $ 55 million deficit in the pool , the lawsuit said			0
