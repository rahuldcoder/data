@entity0 is burning -- scorched for nearly a year by tenacious political resistance , a merciless security crackdown and cries for democracy			1
the spark that lit the flame began about a year ago in the southern city of @entity8 after the arrests of at least 15 children for painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of a school			1
the community 's blunt outrage over the children 's arrests and mistreatment , the government 's humiliating and violent reactions to their worries , and the people 's refusal to be cowed by security forces emboldened and helped spread the @entity0 opposition			1
fate of neighborhood uncertain @entity28 soon became a rallying cry across the country for what began as a rural and provincial - driven uprising			1
@entity0 compare the dramatic dynamics in the rural city to the moment @entity36 street vendor @entity37 torched himself in december 2010			1
@entity37 's act and death spawned demonstrations that led to the grassroots ouster of @entity36 president @entity43 @entity42 and fueled other protests across the @entity46 world			2
@entity47 -- a @entity49 , @entity48 - based @entity0 activist whose family hails from @entity8 -- said @entity8 residents broke the people 's " wall of fear " by defying what he and others call a police state and taking to the street			1
" what people did in @entity8 was unheard of , " he said			1
@entity61 , a journalist from @entity28 now living in @entity62 , said , " they started protesting day after day			2
" " it was the flame of the revolution			0
" a slow burn into a firestorm discontent in @entity0 has slow - burned for decades			1
a clampdown on a a @entity71 uprising by the current president 's predecessor and father -- president @entity75 -- killed thousands in @entity76 in 1982			0
when @entity77 took the presidency after his father died in 2000 , he gave lip service to reforms			0
but activists who emerged from the so - called @entity83 after the death of @entity75 and those in 2005 who urged reforming what they said was an " authoritarian , totalitarian and cliquish regime " found themselves in trouble with the authorities			0
there was sectarian and ethnic unrest in the last decade , too , with a @entity93 uprising flaring in 2000 and a @entity95 rebellion erupting in 2004			0
when the @entity96 unfolded last year , @entity0 imbibed the contagious revolutionary fervor spreading across the @entity98			1
but the anger smoldered under the surface because of the @entity103 - sized , all - seeing and all - knowing security and spying apparatus			0
protests popped up in @entity0 as video images of public defiance in @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity36 swept the world -- small outpourings seen by observers as tests to build a @entity0 nerve to take to the streets			1
@entity8 sits just a few miles from the @entity116 border			1
it has had its economic struggles , such as drought and drops in subsidies and salaries			0
nevertheless , it had been a reliable bastion of support for the regime and its @entity125			0
tribal and predominantly @entity126 , @entity8 is like many small towns			1
people know one another and the relationships are close in the city and in the nearby villages and towns			2
when the schoolchildren were arrested in late february 2011 , they were accused of scrawling graffiti on a school that said " the people want to topple the regime			1
" @entity47 , the activist , said security went to a school , interrogated students and rounded up suspects			2
it was n't as if this vandalism was rare			0
such graffiti was becoming so common in the region that @entity148 was needed to buy spray cans			2
but these arrests struck a chord			0
residents found out their boys were being beaten and tortured in prison			0
the families of the boys approached authorities and asked for their sons ' release			0
activists and observers say authorities shunned and insulted the people			0
one official reportedly said : " forget your children			2
if you really want your children , you should make more children			2
if you do n't know how to make more children , we 'll show you how to do it			2
" " at some point , the insult is so far below the belt			0
people do respond to it			0
they just do n't bow down anymore , " @entity177 's @entity176 said			0
protests grow on march 16 , a female - led sit - in in @entity83 demanded the release of prisoners unfairly jailed			2
some of the participants were @entity183 , with strong ties back to their home province , and part of the educated , urbanite youth living in @entity83			0
" police dragged protesters by the hair and beat them , " said @entity188 , a novelist , professor and activist in @entity190 with contacts across @entity0			1
" this built on the gathering outrage over the @entity8 children who are prisoners , " a day later , a sit - in in @entity8 , with some detained			1
the next day , on march 18 , a protest against the arrests of the children , according to the @entity202			2
" security forces opened fire , killing at least four protesters and within days , the protests grew into rallies that gathered thousands of people , " the group said			2
activists regard these as the first deaths in the @entity0 uprising			1
people began rallying in other cities across @entity0 that day -- @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218			1
@entity188 said the government responded with live fire only in @entity8			1
but the more people demonstrated in @entity8 , the tougher security forces cracked down			1
and as the crackdown worsened , the more resolute the protesters became			0
the people in @entity8 " did n't want to go against the regime , " @entity47 said			1
" people thought this guy -- @entity77 -- was better than his dad			0
nobody wanted to go face - to - face with him			0
" it 's not like they fought with arms at that moment , " he said			0
" they were just defiant			0
' all that we want is our children			2
' " the youths were eventually freed , but @entity241 videos and demonstrations were already spreading			0
@entity243 addressed the @entity8 unrest in a march 30 speech before lawmakers , blaming the unrest on sedition			1
" they started in the governorate ( province ) of @entity8 , " @entity77 said , adding " the conspirators took their plan to other governorates			1
" " that speech had a catastrophic impact , " the @entity256 's @entity255 said			0
" people who wanted to support the regime at the time were shocked by the speech			0
" the dismissiveness of @entity77 and the lawmakers who applauded his words awakened many @entity0 people , says the @entity202 's @entity265			1
two days later , weekly anti-government protests began across @entity0			1
calls for reforms soon morphed into calls for the removal of the @entity77 regime			0
" courage is contagious , " @entity265 said			0
the government launched a full - scale siege on @entity8 april 25 , with other towns such as @entity276 to follow			1
@entity278 arrests unfolded and tales of torture spread across the country			1
the protest movement grew and solidified into an opposition			0
@entity284 , director of the @entity285 , points out " it 's conceivable that if the events did n't happen in @entity8 , " the uprising " might not have occurred			1
" but the deep - seated political and economic reasons underlining @entity0 discontent was an omen			1
protest in @entity0 was " going to happen " at some point , @entity284 said			2
so , out of @entity8 , a spark			2
and a year later , the uprisings blaze on			2
" the impact of small events on history can be huge , " @entity284 said .			0

the @entity0 protests began in the southern city of @entity8
school children were arrested for anti-government graffiti
a year later , the protests have spread throughout the country
