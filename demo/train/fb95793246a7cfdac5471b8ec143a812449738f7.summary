-- @entity2 's ipo was all the rage friday			1
retail investors -- people like you , me and our neighbors -- flocked to the offering in hopes of returning to those glory days when a dramatic rise in stock price was a given			2
but , alas , like so many recent ipos , @entity2 languished near its offering price on its first day and dropped on subsequent days of trading			1
it could have been worse			0
disgruntled investors had ample opportunity to sell friday afternoon once technical issues at @entity21 were resolved			2
those who chose to sell did so at a profit			0
investors in some other ipos never have the chance to recoup what they put in			1
for example , @entity27 , a company that owns the world 's largest propane processing plant , began trading below its offering price in early may			1
nearly a month later , the stock still trades below what original investors paid			2
so if profits are n't guaranteed , why the uproar over @entity2 's ipo ? because an analyst at @entity37 , the investment bank which set the offering price , released a report lowering the financial forecast for the company just before the offering			1
angry stockholders allege the report was released only to a select circle of institutional investors , who then headed for the door			2
consequently , most investors were left to shoulder the loss			2
if this feels unfair to you , you 're not alone			0
after all , why should you have to lose out ? after the dot - com crash , @entity53 and @entity54 , @entity52 included provisions in the much maligned @entity58 legislation to address potential conflicts of interest			2
among other things , the bill led to a so - called " @entity63 " separating communication between investment bank research analysts and underwriters			0
however last month a bipartisan bill , innocuously named the @entity68 , rolled back these and other investor protections for companies with less than $ 1 billion in revenue , deemed emerging growth companies			1
once again , research analysts can communicate directly with management and if desired share favorable ( or unfavorable ) reports			0
under these new rules it is only a matter of time before an enterprising young analyst crosses the line and writes an ethically questionable report			0
prior to @entity58 , researchers at @entity83 and @entity84 universities found that analysts affiliated with the underwriting bank issued buy ratings to prop up dropping stocks , only to watch the stocks drop further after the buy rating was issued			0
this was in direct contrast to reports written by unaffiliated analysts , where stocks rose following a buy rating			0
the differences in performance were staggering			0
for markets to function effectively , investors need to trust the information reported by companies , and research analysts need to be able to act independently			1
investors should remember that any stock can lose value no matter how much hype surrounds the company , and that research analysts have many bosses -- not just the small investors on the streets			1
@entity52 must create a level playing field such that every investor has a fair shake , not just those who have special access			0
@entity2 was just a warning			1
the real risk lies in the countless other ipos less likely to receive so much scrutiny and spotlight			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity125 .			1

investors are suing @entity2 about withholding information on the company 's ipo
@entity125 : small investors like you and me lose out
he says the new @entity68 will in fact roll back protections for investors
@entity125 : @entity2 was just a warning ; *future* ipos are more risky
