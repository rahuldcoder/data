-- despite claims to the contrary , the @entity2 government is almost certainly responsible for a blackout thursday that shut down virtually all internet service in the country , according to a leading web security firm			1
" the @entity2 minister of information is being reported as saying that the government did not disable the @entity13 , but instead the outage was caused by a cable being cut , " writes @entity9 , ceo of @entity10			1
" from our investigation , that appears unlikely to be the case			0
" fighting again between rebels and forces loyal to president @entity22 disrupted much of @entity23 on friday , and there was no internet service throughout much of @entity2 for a second straight day			1
the airport was closed to flights , and fighting killed another 31 people across the country on friday , according to an opposition group that counts casualties			0
a @entity2 government information minister said that " terrorists " -- which is how the @entity22 regime refers to rebels in a bloody , ongoing civil war -- cut the cable , knocking out web communication with other countries			1
rebels have routinely used the @entity43 to transmit images of the civil war , including what they claim have been military attacks by the @entity22 regime on civilians			1
but @entity9 said only four @entity13 cables connect @entity2 to the outside world			0
three of them run underseas , and the fourth is an overland line through @entity54			0
" in order for a whole country outage , all four of these cables would have had to been cut simultaneously , " he wrote			0
" that is unlikely to have happened			0
" connections in all regions of @entity2 , not just routes in some , were shut down in the outage , which began at 5:26 a.m. est on thursday , he wrote			1
the exclusive provider of web service in @entity2 is the state - run @entity65			2
the last four sites accessed on @entity10 before the outage were a photo - sharing site , a @entity2 news site , a @entity71 - oriented social networking site and a porn site , according to @entity9			2
" in other words , traffic from @entity2 accessing the internet in the moments before they were cut off from the rest of the world looks remarkably similar to traffic from any part of the world , " he wrote			2
web analytics company @entity82 , which has closely monitored the @entity2 situation , reported friday that a small handful of " net blocks " that had survived the original blackout had been yanked offline , as well			2
@entity82 originally reported that about 90 % of @entity2 's internet connections were offline			1
a graphic on the firm 's site friday showed virtually no service remaining			0
the moment that @entity2 's @entity13 went down @entity2 government sites , however , had remained accessible because they 're hosted in other countries , including the @entity94			1
the @entity95 reports that several hosting companies said they were working late thursday to take those sites down			0
the @entity94 government has been providing @entity2 rebels with " non-lethal equipment , " including communication tools to get around @entity13 outages			1
" the @entity2 government has been monitoring ( the @entity13 ) for years			1
they have been using the internet with @entity109 assistance to track opposition activists , arrest and kill them , " said @entity104 , the @entity94 ambassador to @entity2 , in @entity105 on wednesday			0
beyond bodies and bombs : @entity2 attempt ' a normal life ' meanwhile , web giant @entity114 is pitching in , enabling in @entity2 a service that lets users post messages to @entity118 by speaking into a mobile phone			1
the service , @entity121 , was developed by @entity114 and @entity118 about two years ago when web access was shut down during a civil movement in @entity124			2
" in the last day , internet access has been completely cut off in @entity2			0
unfortunately we are hearing reports that mobile phones and landlines are n't working properly either , " the company wrote in a post on its @entity129 site			0
" but those who might be lucky enough to have a voice connection can still use @entity121 by simply leaving a voicemail " on one of several devoted phone lines .			0
