-- wednesday night in @entity2 , @entity1 tried to imply that president @entity3 had given $ 90 billion in tax breaks to solar and wind companies			1
after first noting ( more accurately ) that $ 90 billion went to the " green energy world , " @entity1 followed up with " do n't forget ... you put $ 90 billion -- like 50 years worth of breaks -- into solar and wind			1
" personally , i wish the president had			0
but it just is n't true			0
the actual number was more like $ 21 billion			1
i know , because i helped oversee the administration 's efforts in this area			0
the larger number refers to all of the investments in the 2009 stimulus package that the administration designated " green " in any way			2
the number included $ 6 billion for advanced batteries to make electric cars possible , $ 29 billion for energy efficiency and home retrofits , $ 3 billion for job training , and even $ 18 billion for transit and high speed rail			1
to pretend that all of that money went to solar and wind companies is ludicrous			2
worse , @entity1 alleged that the administration picked only " losers			2
first of all , many of these initiatives began under president @entity39 , including some of the loan guarantee programs @entity1 likes to attack			1
with the exception of @entity44 , the track record for renewable energy investments is strong			2
in fact , the failure rate is lower than @entity47 anticipated when they created these programs -- and , while we 're on the topic , higher than @entity1 's 80 % success rate at @entity52			1
@entity0 @entity53 : are half of green energy firms funded by stimulus out of business ? the @entity58 says that there are 3.1 million green jobs in the @entity61 right now			1
this is a big success story for @entity3			2
today , there are 75,000 americans employed in the wind energy business alone , compared with 81,000 coal miners			2
today , the top three clean - tech states each employ more people in green jobs than the coal industry does nationwide			0
@entity1 is willing to jeopardize those jobs by arguing for killing the wind energy tax credit -- while refusing to end subsidies and supports for the fossil fuel industry			1
opinion : @entity77 to candidates : talk to us ( by the way : @entity83 employment is still high			0
regulations that place more stringent public health standards on coal mining have actually created more jobs in coal mining industry , thanks to @entity90			0
even if the number of miners goes down at some point , i would blame dynamite , not government regulations			0
more and more , " mountaintop removal " is the standard practice for coal companies , and simply blowing up a mountain to scrape the coal out requires fewer workers			0
) @entity1 is right that @entity3 has not been willing to open up some public lands for oil drilling and coal mining			1
that is a good thing			1
if it were left up to people like @entity1 , there might be oil rigs in places like the @entity111			2
that approach not only desecrates our nation 's natural beauty , it is an unnecessary and excessive risk			0
the @entity61 is on its way to being a net oil exporter , without jeopardizing the beauty and integrity of our public lands			1
both conservatives and liberals should be happy with @entity3 's energy policies			1
oil , coal and natural gas production is up , which should please the right			0
but energy efficiency and conservation is also up , which should please the left			0
@entity1 -- like his running mate , @entity132 -- sounds great when he is spinning his yarns about @entity61 under @entity3			1
but he knows precious little about the renewable energy industry and is relying on @entity137 talking points to score cheap points , at the expense of @entity61 's clean energy entrepreneurs			0
there is an upside : this fall , both @entity132 and @entity1 have already created a full employment program -- for fact checkers			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			0

@entity147 : @entity1 was **wrong** to imply *adminsitration* spent $ 90 billion on solar , wind
he says $ 21 billion spent on solar / wind , the rest on other green energy initiatives
@entity147 says @entity1 was **wrong** to say investments were failures ; success rate was high
he says it 's a good thing @entity3 is against drilling on some public lands
