" we can not kill our way out of this war , " @entity1 spokesperson @entity0 said on tuesday			0
" we need in the medium to longer term to go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups , whether it 's lack of opportunity for jobs ... " since then , @entity0 has been attacked by conservatives , particularly for her jobs remarks			0
but she 's right in her assessment			0
and , i would suggest , she should have gone further : there 's reason to think that bombing is exactly what @entity20 wants us to do			1
why else would they be goading us into it ? it 's called " terrorism " for a reason			0
the goal is to cause terror , to scare people into acting -- or overreacting			2
the most recent @entity20 propaganda video was produced in @entity32 for a reason			1
it seems they want the @entity36 to react and take the bait			1
months ago , a war - weary @entity39 was suddenly whipped back into a pro-military - action frenzy			0
why ? writing in @entity42 , @entity43 , explained : " all it took was a carefully stagecrafted beheading video and the usual gang of conservative jingoists to exploit it			0
" longtime defense analyst @entity49 made a similar point : " a @entity52 video of a beheading forces the @entity39 president to go to ' war ' in order to avoid being called weak by his domestic political opposition			0
that 's not leadership ! worse , the so - called hawks push for deeper involvement irrespective of military reality			2
they live in a fantasy world of @entity39 military exceptionalism			0
" @entity20 then beheaded a @entity67 journalist , so the @entity67 stepped up its military support in the campaign against @entity20			1
then @entity20 goaded @entity70 with a video of the hideous immolation of a @entity70 pilot			1
now @entity20 has just goaded @entity75 with a mass execution ... and @entity75 has , predictably , responded			1
anyone who does n't see a pattern here is n't looking			0
yes , the violent terrorism of @entity20 is medieval and inhumane			1
that does n't mean it ca n't also be rational			0
and this is where the assessment of @entity0 and the @entity86 administration -- and @entity87 calling for even further military action -- falls short of the mark			0
not only can we not kill our way out of this war , but killing may exacerbate the situation			2
why would @entity20 goad the world to attack it ? to be legitimized as a forceful threat , while at the same time provoking actions that lead to more civilian casualties when nations strike back			1
this provokes more rage at the @entity36 and its regional allies , drawing more martyrs and sympathizers to the terrorist cause			1
and we are playing into @entity20 ' hands : in @entity108 , @entity20 had to put up giant screens to show its beheading videos			1
but in the @entity36 , mainstream media is doing it for them , covering @entity20 propaganda as 24/7 fear - mongering under the banner of news			1
effective counterterrorism strategy begins with not doing what the terrorists want us to do			2
but right now , we are the dog being wagged by the tail of @entity20			1
after all , while the capacity to commit terrorism likely involves some psychosis , terrorists do n't just spontaneously spring from the ground like demonic daisies			2
in 2006 , the @entity129 compiled by @entity39 's top counterterrorism agencies found that the war in @entity132 had , according to a @entity134 article , " become a primary recruitment vehicle for violent @entity137 extremists , motivating a new generation of potential terrorists around the world whose numbers may be increasing faster than the @entity39 and its allies can reduce the threat			0
" @entity20 and its ilk want to concoct an existential war between their brand of fundamentalist @entity137 and the rest of the globe			1
the leadership of @entity20 may do abhorrent things because of a crazy adherence to an apocalyptic interpretation of @entity137 , as @entity154 has just written in the @entity155			1
but they do n't just slaughter people , they produce hi - definition , theatrically staged , @entity32 - language videos of the slaughter , as well as a propaganda magazine in @entity32			0
@entity39 's homeland , thankfully , has not been the direct target of @entity20 violence , but we have been the target of this propaganda			1
recruits are flocking to @entity20			1
this is not to say there 's no military solution to @entity20 , though many experts such as @entity49 certainly doubt that such tactics will work			2
it may ultimately be smarter to push a political solution , such as the division of @entity132 and the region into new sectarian - based states , as has been proposed in the past			0
whatever the solution , what is clear is that the values and vision of @entity39 and our allies in the region should be proactively driving the agenda rather than a reactionary furor whipped up at the whim of @entity20			2
we have to stop broadcasting their propaganda			0
we have to stop responding with bombs every time they provoke us with videotaped slayings			0
we have to stop being weak and fearful in the face of @entity20 ' threats			2
otherwise , no matter how much territory we bomb , @entity20 will keep winning			2
in fact , if you think the only way to defeat them is with bombing , they 've already won .			0

@entity205 : overreacting to @entity20 ' *atrocities* is what the terrorists want to aid them in recruiting
she says the @entity36 will not win against @entity20 this way ; it will only make the situation worse
