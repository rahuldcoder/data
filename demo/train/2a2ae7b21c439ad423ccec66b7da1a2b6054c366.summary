-- " no negotiating with terrorists " versus " leave no soldier behind			0
" with the long war in @entity8 winding down , the plight of @entity6 sgt. @entity5 has left the @entity10 government trying to reconcile those two longstanding credos in a bid to win the freedom of the only @entity10 solider held as a captive			1
@entity5 has been held by insurgents in @entity17 since 2009			1
extremely sensitive discussions are under way with intermediaries overseas to see if there is any ability to gain his release , a @entity10 official told @entity0 on tuesday			1
the official declined to be identified due to the nature of the discussions , which are being led by @entity10 diplomats , although the @entity27 is also involved			2
@entity27 spokesman rear adm. @entity28 declined comment , but @entity5 's family welcomed the news in a statement on tuesday			1
source : missing @entity10 soldier @entity5 seen in video " we applaud the unity of purpose and resolve at the @entity38 and the other @entity10 government agencies involved , " the @entity35 said			1
" we thank all involved for this renewed effort and we hope everyone takes this opportunity seriously			0
we are cautiously optimistic these discussions will lead to the safe return of our son after more than four and a half years in captivity			0
" the discussions were first reported by @entity48 last week			0
home - state sen. @entity49 , @entity51 , said @entity5 's release is " the highest priority that i have in my office , " and said he 's confident it 's at the top of other government officials ' lists as well			1
" frankly , a lot of what 's going on is confidential and can not be discussed			0
and i 'm not familiar with exactly what details are going on right now in terms of any negotiations , " @entity49 told @entity0			2
" what i can assure you is i 've met with our military and diplomatic and intelligence authorities , both in the @entity10 and in @entity8 and @entity17 , about this , and i 'm convinced that they are making this a very high priority			2
" @entity10 officials are adamant they have never given up on trying to get @entity5 back and resist calling the current effort " renewed " discussions			1
but driving the current effort , according to the @entity10 official , is @entity5 's poor health and concern a full troop withdrawal from @entity8 at year 's end would essentially close the door an any rescue attempt			1
the @entity10 has long declared that it wo n't negotiate with terrorists , which is what it considers the @entity86			2
however , " we have a history of being able to dance pretty effectively along the edges of the declaration , " said retired maj. gen. @entity87 , a @entity0 military analyst			2
" we have had communications with all forms of bad guys , to include the @entity86 , in the past , " @entity87 said			0
this time , the planned @entity10 pullout means " the clock is ticking " on efforts to bring @entity5 home , he said			1
one possible obstacle to securing his release is what may be asked in return			0
the @entity86 has long demanded the release of five detainees at the @entity10 military prison at @entity106 , @entity107 -- but another @entity10 official said releasing them would be difficult because @entity109 would have to be notified in advance , and lawmakers have previously resisted releasing them			2
@entity5 : strong , well - rounded and easy to talk to , friends say @entity113 , who served as a deputy assistant @entity6 secretary under former president @entity116 , said that trading @entity106 inmates for @entity5 would put at risk " every @entity10 soldier deployed all over the world			1
" " we are sending the message to terrorist organizations all over the world that it 's ok to capture an @entity10 soldier -- that @entity10 will deal with you , " said @entity113 , now a defense consultant in @entity121			1
" i think we need to give the green light to the special ops and let them do their jobs quietly and methodically , as they have done so well in the past , " he added			0
in may 2012 , the @entity10 government acknowledged that it had been engaged in talks with the @entity86 to free @entity5 , but those talks moved in fits and starts because of @entity10 concerns that any @entity86 prisoners swapped for the sergeant might be repatriated and allowed to rejoin the fight			1
but @entity87 said the possibility of a prisoner swap should n't alarm @entity10 policymakers			2
" the @entity10 has been holding these folks in @entity106 for quite some time			0
they have gone through very , very specifically what the charges are , what their activities are , " @entity87 said			0
" and if the @entity10 figures and if our legal system figures that the release of these individuals will guarantee the release of a soldier ... it 's an opportunity and an option we should avail ourselves of			1
" @entity5 , of @entity160 , @entity161 , appeared in diminished health in a video that the @entity10 military obtained in january			1
his family also received a letter from him last year via the @entity167			0
the @entity10 believes one route to getting @entity5 back may be through @entity170 officials , who have been talking to the @entity86			1
but @entity5 is believed to be held by operatives from the @entity172 , an insurgent force affiliated with the @entity86 and @entity174 -- and it was not clear whether @entity172 operatives would abide by any agreement among the @entity10 , @entity170 and the @entity86			1
at the @entity38 , spokesman @entity178 said there are no " active negotiations " with the @entity86 , " but there should be no doubt that we work every day using our military , our intelligence and our diplomatic tools to see sergeant @entity5 returned home safely			2
" " clearly , if negotiations do resume at some point , then we will want to talk with the @entity86 about the safe return of sergeant @entity5 , " @entity178 said			0
@entity190 has repeatedly conducted prisoner exchanges with its foes in the @entity194 and @entity195 movements			0
in 2011 , it traded more than 1,000 palestinians held in its jails for a single @entity190 soldier , @entity200 , who had been held captive by @entity194 for five years			0
the exchanges have been met with some opposition by the @entity190 public , but a poll found @entity190 overwhelmingly favored the swap that freed @entity200			0
prime minister @entity209 acknowledged the @entity197 prisoners he traded " will not be paying the full price that they deserve to " but told the families of their victims , " the state of @entity190 does not abandon its soldiers and its citizens			0
