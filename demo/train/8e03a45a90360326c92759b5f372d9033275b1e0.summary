though @entity2 was convicted of rape , the wealthy heir to the du pont family fortune was spared prison by a @entity6 court in 2009 because he would " not fare well " behind bars , according to court documents @entity8 obtained tuesday			1
@entity10 is a great - grandson of the chemical magnate @entity13			1
he received an eight - year prison sentence in 2009 for raping his toddler daughter , but the sentencing order signed by a @entity6 judge said " defendant will not fare well " in prison and the eight years were suspended			1
@entity10 was placed on eight years ' probation and ordered to get treatment and register as a sex offender , the documents show			1
he was also prohibited from having contact with children under 16 , including his own children			2
the documents were never sealed , yet the ruling managed to go unnoticed until march , when @entity10 ' former wife , @entity10 , filed a lawsuit in @entity31 on behalf of their children alleging " personal injuries arising from the childhood sexual abuse			1
" the 11 - page suit alleges that not only was their daughter abused , but @entity10 abused their son , too			1
the suit seeks unspecified monetary damages			2
while he was convicted of raping his daughter , @entity10 has never been charged with sexually molesting his son , according to @entity45 , a spokesman for the @entity6 attorney general 's office			1
@entity8 tried repeatedly to reach @entity10 and @entity47 , the attorney who represented him in 2009			1
@entity47 is no longer representing @entity10 , his assistant told @entity8 on wednesday			2
@entity8 asked if he had a comment ; he has not offered one			0
attorney @entity53 is representing @entity54 in the civil case , his assistant told @entity8			0
@entity53 has not returned e-mails or voice mail messages @entity8 has left for him			0
this week , after news of @entity10 ' 2009 case came to light , many took to @entity62 to criticize the judge in the case , saying that it echoed a recent @entity67 case in which a wealthy teenager driving drunk killed four people but received no jail time			1
@entity71 was sentenced last year to 10 years ' probation			2
a witness in @entity71 's case claimed the teenager was a victim of " affluenza " -- the product of wealthy , privileged parents who never set limits for the boy			0
@entity6 's @entity82 prohibits judge @entity83 from discussing the 2009 ruling with reporters , court spokeswoman @entity81 told @entity8			2
but at least one member of the @entity6 legal community came to @entity83 's defense tuesday			0
" it 's wrong to attribute ( the ' defendant would not fare well ' comment ) to @entity97 , " said @entity89 , a lawyer who is chairman of a @entity91 committee that he says steps up to respond " when judges are criticized and unable to speak for themselves			2
" @entity89 says the argument that @entity10 would not do well in prison could have been the recommendation of probation or parole officers			1
however , he said , " common sense suggests that it came from defense counsel			0
" as for the prosecutor 's side , the attorney general 's spokesman gave @entity8 a written statement			0
" cases of child sexual abuse are extremely complicated and difficult , " it read			0
the objective is to " secure justice in every case to the best of its ability given the unique facts and circumstances presented in each case -- sometimes that results in a resolution that is less than what prosecutors would want , " the statement read			0
" in this particular case , the facts and circumstances made it unlikely that a conviction could be secured at trial			0
... this resolution protected the victim and imposed conditions that would make it less likely the defendant could harm others			0
