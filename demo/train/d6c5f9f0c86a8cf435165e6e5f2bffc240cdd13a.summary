a frail 18 - year - old @entity2 refugee girl had pleaded : " why have you abandoned us ? " her apartment in @entity6 , @entity2 , had been bombed , her family made homeless , her wheelchair - bound sister thrown out on to the streets with no shelter and no food but also no medical help and no schooling for the girls			1
i discovered that before the civil war the girl excelled in sport and chess , had led a youth group and sang with her church choir			1
now she had lost her home and her school , and she was rapidly losing hope			2
she had written in a private letter : " everything is lost			2
i feel like i should show you so you will believe me			0
" and so because of recognition from the @entity2 supporters in a school in @entity30 , she was offered the chance of a scholarship to study in the @entity33			1
she has now been here for six months and is thriving			0
she works hard because she dreams that one day she can return and make a difference to her war - ravaged country			2
today , @entity39 figures show there are 3 million @entity2 children displaced by the conflict , more than 1 million of whom have had to flee their country in what is now a disaster of biblical proportions			1
some years from now the world will look back and ask why so many of us did so little , faced with a catastrophe that has made more people permanently homeless than in the world 's worst recent natural disasters , like the @entity55 tsunami of 2004 and the @entity57 earthquake of 2010			0
of the 1 million exiled @entity2 children , almost half of them in beleaguered @entity60 , and the mantra of 50 of the world 's top anti-poverty advocacy groups and international institutions is simple			1
" education can not wait			0
" on best estimates they are likely to spend 10 years in camps or temporary shelters			0
they need food not only when starving , shelter when destitute , medical drugs when faced with the risk of polio			0
they also need hope -- hope that there is a future worth preparing for			0
if they are not to lose their childhoods -- a loss that can never be replaced -- the one way to deliver hope is by ensuring they can resume their education			0
amid the chaos there is a plan , a plan conceived in @entity33			0
it puts existing @entity60 schools on double shifts -- starting earlier and finishing later to give more lessons for more pupils -- and offers all 435,000 refugees spread across the country the chance of formal education			1
the annual cost is $ 400 dollars per pupil which is cost - effective because we do not have to create new facilities			0
proof that the double shift system works , albeit on a smaller scale , can be found in a north @entity60 village called @entity109			1
in a unique effort volunteer @entity2 teachers , local @entity60 school heads and a small @entity113 charity called @entity114 , are operating the local school on a timeshare basis outside of normal school hours			1
almost immediately boys and girls who have fled from burnt - down and bombed schools and who were a few weeks ago child laborers or even beggars have started to recover their lost childhood and now have hope that there is something to live for			2
the country - wide @entity60 plan can be operational within weeks			1
and what has been achieved for a few hundred children in @entity132 can be now achieved for all 435,000 @entity2 child refugees in @entity60 -- if we urgently adopt the plan			1
my frustration is that an idea conceived eight months ago , negotiated with the @entity60 prime minister six months ago and the subject of two in - depth reports -- one by the respected @entity142 and another by @entity143 and @entity39 -- is still sitting on a table waiting implementation while children spend a winter walking the streets begging , some now trafficked into prostitution and some even forced into marriage as child brides			1
this week the @entity60 prime minister , @entity152 , travels to @entity153 to make a plea for his nation and its people			1
one of the world 's smallest countries , @entity60 has been left to shoulder the biggest burden of the crisis and it is unable to cope without international support			1
almost 25 % of its entire population are now @entity2 refugees			2
it is the equivalent of 15 million refugees arriving on the shores of the @entity33			0
the @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and the @entity172 have backed the plan , which would cost $ 195 million dollars a year to secure schooling for the 435,000 children			2
now with 50 of the world 's top international aid agencies making an urgent plea , today all countries with aid budgets should come on board			1
an important principle is at stake			0
more than 100 years ago , the @entity184 established the principle that the right to health care transcends borders			0
now we can establish that even in war zones children can learn			2
some good can yet emerge out of the ruins .			0

more than *400,000* @entity2 children have fled to @entity60 to avoid the civil war
a new scheme extends school hours in @entity60 so more children can be educated
@entity200 is urging *governments* with aid budgets to help fund the initiative
