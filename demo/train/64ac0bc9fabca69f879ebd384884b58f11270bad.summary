president @entity0 may have promised @entity1 that they can keep their insurance if they like it , but that 's not the case in at least three states where insurance companies are required to discontinue plans that do n't meet @entity9 's new coverage standards			1
@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 have told insurance companies that they must scrap insurance plans that do n't meet the minimum coverage requirements laid out in the @entity9			1
some states allow insurers to amend their current plans to include the new benefits , such as maternity care and prescription drug coverage , required under @entity9			1
but these three states have determined that with so many changes required under @entity9 , it 's easier to start over than to try to bring existing plans into compliance			1
@entity26 , a spokeswoman for the @entity27 of @entity28 , explained the policy this way : " in this case , you 're talking about an entirely new product			0
they had to file a completely new policy			0
... it was easier just to start from scratch			1
" that means that about half of the roughly 600,000 people in @entity11 's private insurance market will have their current insurance plans discontinued by the end of next year			1
private insurance only makes up part of the state 's insurance market , which also includes employer - based coverage , and @entity49 and @entity50			0
@entity51 of insurance spokesman @entity52 said insurance companies could offer customers with discontinued plans similar coverage , but it also has to include the new mandated @entity9 benefits			1
but , he cautioned , " it is virtually impossible to compare what you have to what you 're going to have because of all the new provisions			0
" indeed , some people may find the new plans cost more			0
others might qualify for subsidies and pay less for their insurance			1
@entity70 spokesman @entity69 on tuesday defended the president 's promise , arguing that anyone who has a plan that predates the @entity9 can keep that plan -- as long as its terms have not changed in the interim			2
" the president was clear about a basic fact : if you had insurance that you liked on the individual market , and you wanted to keep that insurance through 2010 , ' 11 , ' 12 , ' 13 and in perpetuity if you wanted it and it was available , you could			0
you were grandfathered in , " @entity69 said at the @entity70 briefing tuesday			2
in practice , insurance companies are loath to leave their plans unchanged , so grandfathered plans are disappearing			2
numbers for how many grandfathered plans are hard to come by , and insurers do n't seem to be looking back			2
" health plans want to keep their customers			0
in notifying consumers about changes to their existing coverage , health plans are educating them about their new coverage options , including the benefits and assistance that are available through the new marketplaces , and helping them enroll , " said @entity98 , a spokesman for @entity99			0
but even having to enroll in a new plan could leave some people confused and upset , particularly after the president assured them repeatedly that that would n't be the case .			0

@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 tell insurers to end *non-compliant* plans
" it was easier just to start from scratch , " rather than fixing old plans , one official says
some customers with old plans may pay more for new ones ; others may get subsidies
@entity70 stand by *assertion* that customers could keep their insurance plans
