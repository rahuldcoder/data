@entity0 -- a former archbishop of @entity3 was accused friday of covering up child abuse by a @entity6 clergyman who has since died			1
the accusations against the late very rev. @entity8 are the result of a joint investigation by the @entity11 and the @entity13 newspaper , based in @entity14			1
the @entity11 alleges that @entity8 , who died in 2007 from cancer , abused choirboys and school children , and that the former archbishop of @entity3 , @entity18 , failed to report the abuse claims to police or child protection authorities after he was made aware of them in 1999 and 2003			1
the former archbishop , who was made @entity24 after he stood down in 2005 , said he had followed the legal requirements of the time			1
" throughout my time as bishop and archbishop i always adhered to the statutory practices of the @entity6 concerning safeguarding , " he said in a statement friday			1
" i strenuously deny ( and am obviously disappointed at ) the suggestion that myself or my team at the time would have acted negligently in this or any other safeguarding matter			0
" under the @entity6 's @entity39 on @entity40 , there was no automatic legal obligation on the church to refer allegations by adults to the police or social services , his statement said			2
the policy , which has since been reviewed , said only that steps should be taken to protect children from any further abuse			2
" in considering whether children would be at risk from @entity8 i decided under these guidelines that this would not be the case given his serious ill health following cancer surgery , " @entity24 said			2
" the following year i revoked @entity8 's permission to officiate			2
he died two years later			0
" @entity8 , once dean of @entity60 , is accused in the @entity11 of grooming and abusing @entity62 , who was an 11 - year - old choir boy when he first met the clergyman in 1984			1
@entity62 , now 40 , told the newspaper the abuse lasted through his teenage years and he was only now starting to come to terms with it			0
claims of abuse at the hands of @entity8 have also been made by pupils at a residential school in @entity73 , @entity13 , where he was headmaster from 1961 to 1970 , according to the @entity11			1
the diocese of @entity60 said it was aware of the allegations of past abuse against its former dean and was " working cooperatively with the parties concerned			0
" the diocese places the " highest priority on all child safeguarding issues , " and has a comprehensive child protection policy in place across its churches and schools , the statement said			0
" we encourage all who have suffered abuse to report it to the police			0
" the bishop of @entity97 and @entity98 , the right rev. @entity94 , chairman of the @entity95 , said the church would always apologize for " past systems that let down the vulnerable " and offer support to anyone affected			0
" when any church - related abuse or allegation of abuse comes to light our first concern is always for the victim : both that they are being supported and with an acknowledgment that the effects of abuse can be lifelong , " he said			0
the office of the archbishop of @entity3 said it was aware of legal proceedings and could not comment on the allegations at this time			1
" for some years now the @entity6 has been working consistently towards making the church a safe place for all , " it added .			0
