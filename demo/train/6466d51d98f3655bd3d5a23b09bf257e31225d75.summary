@entity0 -- @entity3 curator @entity2 describes the day several years ago he spent going through shipping containers filled with debris from @entity6 as " overpowering , " even though more than a year had passed since september 11 , 2001 , when the plane crashed into a field in @entity9 , @entity10			1
" going through the debris of an airplane was certainly an experience that i 've never had before , " said @entity2 , one of three curators from that museum who focused on gathering 9/11 artifacts full time			1
a special exhibition commemorating 9/11 with the results of their work will open at the museum on saturday			1
they were granted access to the materials from flight 93 after the @entity25 had finished analyzing them as crime - scene evidence			2
" the material was stored in ocean - shipping containers and we opened them up -- i guess we were n't really prepared for how small the bits would be , " according to @entity2			1
" it smelled of jet fuel , of moldy cloth and paper and just sort of mysterious odors that were -- i guess in all honesty -- plain scary , " he said			2
@entity2 and his fellow curators by this time had an idea of what the items they would seek as they dug through the plane debris			1
" one of the big stories on @entity6 was that unlike the other flights ( hijacked on 9/11 ) , it was delayed in taking off and the hijacking happened a little bit later , " the curator said			1
" the passengers knew what their fate was going to be through cell - phone communication			2
people had talked to people on the ground			2
so finding a cell phone was something we really sought , to tell that story of how people became informed and what helped motivate them to action			2
" they found a @entity70 phone that has become part of the @entity0 museum 's permanent exhibit on 9 - 11			1
the curators also collected a gauge from the flight panel of @entity6 , as control of the plane itself was part of the story			1
they also tried to find items that would represent the people who were on the plane , such as seat belts that had been torn in the crash			0
and , they found a part of an @entity89 flag			0
" every @entity91 plane over the exit door has a small @entity89 flag painted into the fuselage and we found the red - and - white stripes of the flag , " @entity2 said			0
" for me , one of the strongest icons is one of the simplest and smallest			0
and that 's the little orange call button that i never really paid attention to , " he said			0
" there was this small little orange button and it 's chipped and it 's scratched but it 's a picture of a person and in a sense , it 's asking for help			0
" the curators were granted a single day to go through the @entity6 containers			1
at the end of the day , they threw away the clothes they had been wearing during their search , as the clothes smelled like that strange odor from the container			0
@entity2 said that during the height of their collecting , he and his colleagues also communicated with family members and others affected by the attacks , to ask for other items related to september 11			0
but , they always worked through an intermediary so that those affected would be comfortable turning down their requests and would not have to say no face to face			0
" it 's difficult to know where the boundary between history and current event is , and when you are collecting something that is a current event , you 're emotionally tied to it and it 's difficult to have any kind of distance to understand it , " @entity2 said			0
" but , so much of it is parting -- if you do n't act fairly quickly , it could easily be gone forever			0
" more than 50 9/11 artifacts collected by curators from the @entity3 will be on display in a special exhibition called " september 11 : remembrance and reflections			1
" the items , collected from @entity149 , the @entity150 and @entity9 , will be on display starting saturday at the museum on tables , not behind glass , to give visitors a close - up , intimate view through september 11 , 2011 .			2
