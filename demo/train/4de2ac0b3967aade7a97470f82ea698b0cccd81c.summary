@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 attacked " idiot " and " lunatic " bloggers wednesday after a customer highlighted what he said were flaws in the budget airline 's web site			1
@entity11 said he found the comments by @entity3 staffers offensive and was disappointed by the airline 's response			1
@entity16 - based web developer @entity11 was booking plane tickets online when he discovered what he thought was a glitch that allowed him to book free @entity3 tickets			1
he duly posted details of the " glitch " on his blog as well as a message on @entity25			2
soon people were trying to replicate what he had done with little success , and he later confirmed that he was unable to book the tickets without paying			2
but among responses on his web site were three purporting to be from @entity3 staff			1
one read : " you 're an idiot and a liar ! ! fact is ! you 've opened one session then another and requested a page meant for a different session , you are so stupid you dont even know how you did it ! " another said : " website is not perfect , life is not perfect ... if you would work in your pathetic life on a such big project in a such busy environment with so little resources , you would know that the most important is to have usual user behavior scenarios working rather than spending time on improbable and harmless things			0
" tell us what you think @entity11 said he later traced the ip addresses of the postings to the airline 's headquarters in @entity16 , something @entity3 later confirmed to @entity2			1
" @entity3 can confirm that a @entity3 staff member did engage in a blog discussion , " said the airline 's spokesman @entity57			1
" it is @entity3 policy not to waste time and energy in corresponding with idiot bloggers and @entity3 can confirm that it wo n't be happening again			2
lunatic bloggers can have the blog sphere all to themselves as our people are far too busy driving down the cost of air travel			1
" @entity11 told @entity2 he was disappointed with @entity3 's response			2
" i was hoping the corporate response was n't in line with the staff members , whose comments i found offensive			1
this was n't a big issue and was really just a small problem ; they could have said they were working on it and they over-reacted			0
" " you can only imagine how many customers they could lose by treating them like this , " he added			0
a spokesman for @entity89 , which represents tour operators and travel agents , said the comments by @entity3 came as no surprise			0
" they treat their customers with contempt			0
we know that @entity3 does n't put any store on customer relations , " said @entity97			0
" this is the way @entity3 conducts its business			0
their clear goal is to provide cheap flights but we do n't believe this is the way to provide customer satisfaction			0
our members do n't do this -- their customers expect a high level of service			0
