@entity0 , @entity1 -- former @entity5 prime minister @entity4 's one - time media adviser said a 2002 intelligence document that claimed @entity7 could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes was not " sexed up " to exaggerate the case for war			1
@entity12 was testifying tuesday at the iraq war inquiry , an independent set of hearings looking into the decisions that led up to the 2003 invasion and governed @entity5 's involvement in the war			1
the former spin doctor testified that his former boss was determined to disarm @entity7 leader @entity21			2
but he said @entity4 had never been in a " rush to war " and that he regarded military action only as a last resort			1
the intelligence document in question came out in september 2002 and detailed the threat posed by @entity7			2
it is most famous for saying that @entity7 could " deploy chemical or biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so			2
" the document came as @entity4 was finding fewer and fewer chances for a diplomatic solution on @entity7 , and he had to convince the @entity5 public of the threat @entity21 posed			1
presenting the intelligence dossier to @entity38 and the public was a way of engaging them in his decision - making , @entity12 said			2
@entity12 said he worked on the dossier with @entity44 , the former head of @entity45 , the @entity5 foreign intelligence agency			1
@entity46 testified at the inquiry last month that it was he who wrote the dossier			0
" at no time did i ever ask him to beef up ( or ) override any of the judgments that he had , " @entity12 said			2
" at no point did anybody from the prime minister down say to anybody in the intelligence services , ' look , you 've got to sort of tailor it to fit this argument , that argument			0
" @entity5 media quickly highlighted the 45 - minute claim ; it filled the headlines of @entity5 newspapers the next day			2
but less than a year later , after coalition forces had entered @entity7 , the media began to question it			2
in may 2003 , a @entity70 report accused the government , and @entity12 in particular , of pushing for the dossier to be " sexed up " to exaggerate the @entity7 threat			1
@entity12 testified that it was intelligence officials who had the final say over any claims made in the dossier , and that @entity46 " had the single pen " for writing it			0
testifying about the dossier last month , @entity46 said , " there was absolutely no conscious intention to manipulate the language or to obfuscate or to create a misunderstanding as to what they might refer to			0
" @entity12 also said he never pushed for changes to the intelligence claims			0
of his numerous e-mails with @entity46 , @entity12 said " not a single word of them at any time sought to question , override , rewrite -- let alone the ghastly " sexed up " phrase -- the intelligence assessments in any way , at any time , on any level			0
" @entity12 blamed the media for latching onto a single phrase and then discrediting the entire dossier once the phrase was unproven			0
he said the 45 - minute claim " was not that big a point " within the overall document			0
" i still defend every single word of the dossier , i defend every single part of the process , " @entity12 said			0
the 45 - minute claim was not the only part of the dossier that inquiry members questioned tuesday			0
they asked @entity12 about the claim that the assessed intelligence has established " beyond doubt " that @entity21 had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons despite @entity118 resolutions			0
@entity4 's former spokesman said " nobody " at the time was saying @entity21 did not have those weapons and that he did not pose a threat			1
but he also admitted such strong language may not have been necessary			0
" would it have been that weakened had those two words not been there ? probably not , " @entity12 said			0
in the first hour of his testimony , @entity12 stressed that @entity4 sought disarmament of @entity21 before any military action			1
he said @entity4 " tried exhaustively to go down the diplomatic route , " believing that conflict was not inevitable			0
" would someone like @entity4 , from the day he went into politics , think that somebody like @entity21 should be got rid of ? yes , he would			0
was that the policy he was pursuing the whole way through ? no , " @entity12 told the inquiry			1
" he was trying to , through the ( @entity118 ) , lead the @entity5 government in the direction of pursuing a policy that would lead ultimately to disarmament of @entity21 , " @entity12 said of @entity4			1
@entity4 said in an interview last month that he would have removed @entity21 even without evidence of weapons of mass destruction in @entity7			1
the inquiry , which began hearings in late november , is the most thorough investigation yet into the decisions that led up to the war			1
it can not find anyone criminally responsible , and it can not even apportion blame , but inquiry members will be able to judge the legality of the conflict and identify lessons learned from @entity5 's involvement			1
prime minister @entity162 promised last year that the committee would have access to the full range of information about the war and the lead - up to it , including secret documents			1
inquiry chairman @entity169 has said @entity4 will be called to testify , and @entity4 has said he will appear			2
@entity5 has held four other hearings about the @entity7 war			1
but because all were held before the end of 2004 -- so close to the start of the war -- they were hampered by limited information , political analysts have said			0
the current inquiry has the greatest potential to tell the " full story " of the decisions leading up to war , analyst @entity177 of @entity178 told @entity2 in november .			1

@entity12 managed the @entity5 government 's case for war in @entity7
@entity12 was @entity4 's powerful director of *communications*
inquiry is most thorough investigation yet into the decisions that led to war
*pm* @entity162 said committee would have access to full range of information about war
