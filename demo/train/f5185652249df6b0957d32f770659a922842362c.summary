-- when the news flashed last week that a man had shot and killed a @entity4 soldier in front of the @entity6 in @entity4 , what most people were wondering -- but not saying out loud -- was , " is it another radical muslim ? " and it was			1
as was @entity12 , the man who ran over two @entity4 soldiers in @entity14			0
as was @entity15 , who attacked four police officers in @entity17 , @entity18 , also last week			2
it 's why i have said before -- we have to be honest , there is a problem in the world of @entity25 today			1
some people have found in it an ideology of opposition and violence against the modern and western world			1
the three jihadis who burst onto the news last week represent that ugly phenomenon			2
but let 's dip deeper into these three people to understand what moved them to become terrorists			2
none of them was born and brought up a religious @entity10			0
a profile of @entity43 in the @entity44 suggests someone who went from a life of partying as a 16 - year - old to repeated arrests for drug possession and stealing a credit card			0
he was once sentenced to prison for two years for possessing a weapon in a robbery			0
in the @entity44 article , one of the counselors at a @entity57 shelter described his battles with addiction thus : " he was doing heroin to take the edge off crack			0
" amidst this turmoil , the @entity44 says , he converted to @entity25 , got radicalized , sought to go to @entity65 to fight in the jihad and finally ended up trying to wage his own version of it in @entity70 and died after killing a soldier			1
the man who ran over the soldiers in @entity4 last week reportedly converted to @entity25 only a year ago			1
the @entity74 says the man who attacked its officers with a hatchet , also clearly disturbed , converted to @entity25 two years ago			1
these are not people steeped in @entity25 -- people for whom the religion has shaped their worldview over decades , people who were motivated by their immersion in the religion			1
on the contrary , these were unstable young men , prone toward radicalism and violence			0
they were searching for an ideology that would fit their disturbed worldview , and in the radical and jihadi interpretations of @entity25 , they found it			1
it is always worth remembering that these people represent a tiny minority			2
after all , think of it this way : terror groups such as @entity98 and @entity99 have been calling on @entity10 to engage in terrorism in @entity102 cities for over 10 years now			0
but of the some 1.6 billion @entity10 worldwide , the number who have responded to these calls is a small , small , small percentage			0
if all @entity10 were radicals , we would have more than three to worry about last week			2
and yet , there is a problem within @entity25			1
it is not enough for @entity10 to point out that these people do not represent the religion			2
but @entity10 need to take more active measures to protest these heinous acts			0
they also need to make sure that @entity10 countries and societies do not in any way condone extremism , anti-modern attitudes and intolerance towards other faiths			0
@entity10 are right to complain that there is anti-muslim bigotry out there			0
but they would have a more persuasive case if they took on some of the bigotry within the world of @entity25 as well .			1

we have to be honest -- there is a problem in the world of @entity25 today , says @entity132
those involved in attacks last week are not people steeped in @entity25 , @entity132 says
muslims must take on some of the bigotry within the world of @entity25 as well , he says
