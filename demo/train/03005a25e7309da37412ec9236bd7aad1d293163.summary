just about every day on @entity2 , i see posts by parents asking for advice related to their children			1
granted , many of my friends are parents , but i imagine you see similar posts when you log on as well			2
and pretty much every time i read one , i wonder about the pluses and minuses of a world in which many parents now head to their social networks to make parenting decisions			1
sure , getting advice on how to get a toddler to sleep through the night or how to deal with a fussy eater makes sense and seems relatively harmless			1
but is there something creepy about picking a baby name based on @entity27 responses or deciding on a punishment based on the opinions of followers ? last year , an expectant father created a website , @entity33 , allowing anyone on the @entity27 to suggest and vote on a baby name for his daughter			0
10 signs you might be addicted to your smartphone thankfully for his child , who was born in april , he and his wife reportedly did not go with the winning name of " @entity45			0
" instead , they chose the second place name , @entity48			0
my question : how is @entity48 or any other child named by strangers online going to feel when they learn the origin of their name ? " i am sure the child will be happy to know that her name was approved of by thousands of strangers she will never meet , " said @entity54 , author of the book " @entity56 : a less is more approach to @entity62 , @entity63 , and @entity64			0
" " can you imagine the outrage an adult would have if , say , a guy crowdsourced whether he should propose or not ? " asked @entity54 , a mom of five who has spent the past two decades working with families on parenting			1
asking not just your followers but random strangers to choose a name for your child is no doubt one of the more extreme examples of crowdsourced parenting , but what about deciding discipline based on social media responses or asking for help with deeply personal issues such as a child 's depression or anxiety , or a case of bullying , or a child 's exploration of sex ? replace the ' sex talk ' with the ' tech talk ' ? in conversations over email with parents across the country , i found a real split in opinions about whether using social media to help parent is positive or inappropriate			1
put mom of four @entity103 in the positive camp			0
she said that since many of us live far away from our parents and friends , " social media crowdsourcing is a quick way of getting a lot of opinions and ideas at one time			1
" @entity115 , founder of the blog @entity117 , said she only crowdsourced for her children once			1
" i asked people how they got their sons to behave better at home and school			0
i did get some good ideas			0
i tried one of them , and it worked , " said @entity115 , who said she 'd do it again			0
@entity129 , a mom of two grown children in @entity131 , also believes crowdsourced parenting is ok in certain cases			1
" we use to call it getting advice during coffee klatches , " said @entity129 , a school psychologist , educational consultant and owner of a business providing sign language instruction			2
28 web abbreviations parents should know @entity143 , host of the blog whatevs , believes there is an age limit on when it 's no longer ok to discuss a child 's behavior on social media and ask for help regarding that behavior , even though she admits she 's not quite sure what that key age is			1
" whether it 's tantrums in kindergarten or wetting the bed at age 9 ... i believe children still have the right to some privacy about their lives , " said @entity143 , a mom of two who writes about motherhood , marathons and life in @entity163 , @entity164			1
" i think that if you are n't sure whether to post something about your kid on @entity2 , ask yourself how the child ( and you ) would feel if he or she ever came across it at the age of 12			0
if you would n't want him or her to see it on your timeline , then it 's probably not a great idea to post it on @entity2			0
" there are things that happen within the family that do not need to be aired in public , said @entity188 , a mom of two and nurse practitioner who works with teens in @entity191 , @entity192			0
chances are , your teen has sexted " i think you are risking your child essentially shutting down if you publicly discuss punishment over social media			2
the postings are too easily shared , and information spreads too widely			0
" @entity200 , a mom of a 9 - year - old in @entity202 , agrees			0
she also thinks parenting by crowdsourcing , which can lead to a multitude of suggestions , can be overwhelming and make parents feel less secure about their own instincts			2
" i think the ease in which parents can go to social media often chips away at their confidence to trust their gut , " said @entity200 , co-founder of the blog @entity209 on a shoestring			2
" the more you are reliant on others to help you make decisions , the less confident you feel making decisions on your own			0
" another issue , said educational psychologist , consultant and parenting coach @entity222 , is when parents rely on social media , when they should instead be talking to professionals such as a teacher , pediatrician or child psychologist			1
teen ' like ' and @entity234 anxiety day notes that people may too often view the advice of some followers and friends , especially popular bloggers who have a large digital footprint , as experts , when in fact they do n't have any expertise on the issues at hand			1
" it 's not necessarily about what your credentials are because you could be one of those really wise parents that has really good advice , but sometimes the way i see it articulated , it 's almost as if the person is a psychologist and they 're in positions that they really do n't know about and they are n't educated on , they have no work experience on , and that gets me worried , " said day , author of " @entity248 , " a book about mother - daughter book clubs			2
" that 's when parents really need to be seeking out professional help			0
" separated at birth , reunited on @entity2 @entity54 , whose newest book " @entity273 " will be released in april , encourages parents to see themselves as " the true experts in their children 's lives , " not their thousands of friends and followers on @entity2 and @entity280			1
" by answering just a few questions , they can begin to see clearly the strategy that will work best for their children and one that they can actually implement to get the kind of long - term sustainable change they are looking for			2
" when do you think crowd sourced parenting is a bad way to go ? share your thoughts with @entity293 on @entity280 or @entity294 on @entity2 .			1

asking for parenting advice via social networks can be harmless , but it can also be *invasive* , @entity293 found
sharing disciplinary *problems* , *emotional* issues or *developmental* issues may be cause resentment for children
" i believe children still have the right to some privacy about their lives , " said parenting blogger @entity143
