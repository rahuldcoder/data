-- if you read the headlines this week about the the death of judge @entity4 , you probably took away that he will be remembered for his conservative judicial philosophy and losing a very contentious @entity7 confirmation battle			1
you probably did n't read about the impact he made on modern media , and maybe even on the debate the @entity11 had about @entity13 this week			1
but that 's part of his legacy , too			2
let 's connect the dots from @entity4 to @entity13 , shall we ? 1			1
the @entity20 president @entity21 nominated @entity4 for the @entity22 @entity7 in 1987			1
during his confirmation hearings , an enterprising reporter found a list of the movies he 'd rented at his local video rental store			1
you might imagine the reporter was looking for something among the rentals that could shed new light on the man			2
what turned up was a pretty ho - hum list of movies including lots and lots of @entity38 and at least one middling @entity40 comedy			2
( the reporter 's own back story on what he was looking for in procuring that rental list is slightly more nuanced -- it 's a good read , which you can find here			1
the @entity46 perhaps the biggest controversy about @entity4 's rental list was how deadly dull it was			1
but , who knows ? maybe some of those lawmakers had something to hide ? within a few short months of the hearings , the @entity52 passed the @entity46 -- @entity46 for short -- a law that was written to keep video rental records private , but which still governs parts of our digital - media world			1
class action catnip the crux of the law , and of the lawsuits that followed , is something called a " private right of action " and a tidy penalty for violating it			2
the @entity46 allows individuals whose viewing history was shared to sue for $ 2,500 a pop. that 's litigation catnip for class - action attorneys , who make a living collecting large groups of allegedly wronged people with something to gain from saying so			1
it was a clever way for lawmakers to ensure that people would abide by the law			2
( now you really want to see those @entity52 - folks ' lists , right ? ) 4			1
goodbye , @entity81 the @entity46 was the law that was used to shut down @entity84 's controversial " @entity81 " program in 2009			1
@entity81 was a feature that powered messages in your news feed about your activities on other websites , a la " @entity85 just bought a diamond ring on @entity87 ! " too bad it was an engagement ring , and @entity84 spoiled the secret			1
@entity84 relented after a class - action lawsuit involving exactly that kind of story -- a @entity84 - foiled marriage proposal			1
the site first provided a way to opt out and eventually shut @entity81 down altogether and coughed up a $ 9.5 million settlement			2
@entity81 became a target because among the activities being shared was video viewing ( in addition to diamond buying and lots of other things )			0
more recent @entity46 suits involve @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			0
enter @entity111 since then , as social networks have exploded in popularity and social media sharing has become de rigueur , just about any of us could flip open @entity84 and see a stream of all the music our friends are listening to right this second			1
but because of the @entity46 , you could n't see the same thing for the movies they 're watching			0
companies like @entity111 have been pushing hard to change that			0
telling your friends what you 're up to is , after all , the modern equivalent of word - of - mouth advertising			0
@entity111 says its users want to be able to share which movies they 're watching online with their friends , and has lobbied @entity52 to amend the law			1
this week , the @entity22 @entity136 approved an amendment to the @entity46 that would allow individuals to opt in to sharing their online viewing habits			2
the @entity140 recently passed something similar , and all signs point to a change in the weeks ahead			0
ok -- bear with me here			0
we 're almost to @entity13			0
looooong privacy policies the amendment the @entity136 passed says explicitly that it is , indeed , possible to give your consent to share information about your video viewing via the @entity11			0
what it does n't necessarily make clear , though , is exactly how to do that , and how a company that is sharing your information can make certain that you understand what you are agreeing to			0
what that means in practical terms is that most terms of use for social and digital media services are very long and exhaustive			1
it 's in companies ' best interest to tell you everything they possibly can about what you 're consenting to , so they ca n't be penalized the way @entity84 was in the @entity81 debacle			1
the @entity13 revolt which is where @entity13 comes in			0
the company announced monday that it would be updating its terms of service to include new ways it could share and treat your personal information and content			2
immediately , people began speculating about why @entity13 might need these new disclosures , and what on earth it could be planning			0
was it going to sell photos of your kids to advertisers , without even telling you about it ? yikes			0
founder @entity197 responded to the frenzy by saying , " we 've heard loud and clear that many users are confused and upset about what the changes mean , " and then tried to get more clear about what the legal documents mean			0
the language that most concerned users ( apparently granting permission to sell images without notifying or paying the user ) would be removed , he said			0
@entity211 : what now ? ok , so what does this mean for us ? it looks as though the law may change , and soon enough you may be able to click a button and tell your friends what you 're watching on @entity111			0
but it also means that terms and privacy policies for digital services may get longer and even more complicated as a result			2
so read those terms , folks			0
especially if you think you might get tapped for the @entity7 .			0

judge @entity4 , who died this week , has unlikely connection to digital media
after a reporter outed @entity4 's video - rental history , @entity52 made doing so *illegal*
that law shut down a @entity84 sharing feature and helped prompt long terms - of - service
an @entity242 update *spurred* this week 's user revolt
