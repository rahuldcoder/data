-- a 1 - year - old child whose family fought a @entity6 hospital over whether he should be allowed to die will likely have an operation to allow the insertion of a breathing tube by the end of the week , his new hospital said			1
@entity12 , widely known in the media as @entity12 , is being evaluated by doctors at @entity15 , a @entity16 hospital in @entity17 , hospital spokesman @entity11 said			2
the hospital had planned to have a press conference on tuesday but canceled it " because there is not yet a firm treatment plan , " he said in a statement late monday			2
but the head of pediatrics at the hospital , @entity27 , expects a tracheotomy to go ahead by the end of the week , the statement said			2
a tracheotomy is a surgical procedure to create an opening into the airway through an incision in the neck			0
a tube allows for suction of fluid out of the lungs , creates a safe and stable way to use a mechanical ventilator , and is more comfortable for the child , the statement said			0
@entity12 , who has a deteriorating neurological condition , was transferred to @entity43 sunday from a hospital in @entity45 , @entity46			1
@entity12 , who was born in january 2010 , had been in the care of the @entity48 in @entity6 since october			2
his doctor , in court papers , said that " all cranial nerve functions are now absent " and there is no hope for recovery			0
he recommended that the infant 's breathing tube be removed and he be allowed to die			0
the child 's parents , @entity59 and @entity60 , sought instead to have their son receive a tracheotomy combined with continued mechanical ventilation so that he could be transferred home , where he would be cared for by his family			1
the child 's aunt , @entity66 , has said that in 2002 the @entity69 ' daughter died at home with a tracheotomy after suffering a similar condition			1
in january , a @entity6 superior court judge ruled in favor of the hospital , saying it could remove the child 's breathing tube without a replacement , and issue a do - not - resuscitate order and recommendations on palliative care			1
the @entity82 fought to have their son relocated to a @entity85 hospital for a second opinion			1
the hospital in @entity6 said it would not perform a tracheotomy because it is an invasive procedure typically recommended for patients who require a long - term breathing machine			1
in a statement on the hospital 's website , it says @entity12 's transfer on sunday happened " despite the strongest possible medical advice to the contrary from medical experts			2
" the @entity12 case gained the attention of pro-life groups including @entity102 and the @entity103 and @entity104 , who organized prayer vigils and rallies in support of the family			1
in february , the hospital began receiving threats and increased security to protect its staff			0
father @entity114 , national director of @entity102 , flew to @entity46 sunday night to help with the transfer			0
he issued a news release saying : " after around - the - clock negotiations , this really became a race against time			0
" @entity12 " needs to be in a hospital that cherishes life over the bottom line , " he said			0
