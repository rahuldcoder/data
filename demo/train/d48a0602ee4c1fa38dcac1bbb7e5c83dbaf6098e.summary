-- amid a falling currency , slumping factory output , lackluster investment and weak orders , @entity2 's prime minister @entity1 looked desperately for at least some chinks of light in the economic gloom			1
addressing parliament , @entity1 struck out for the one silver lining left to his battered economy -- the falling rupee will boost exports			1
" to some extent , depreciation can be good for the economy as this will help to increase our export competitiveness and discourage imports , " @entity1 said last week in a long address to lawmakers on the crisis in the @entity2 economy			1
" over the next few months , i expect the effects of this to be felt more strongly , both in exports and in the financial position of exporting sectors			2
this in itself would correct the current account deficit to some extent			1
" whether investors will share his confidence is the question economists are asking themselves as the axles come loose on @entity2 's economic juggernaut			1
slowing growth the @entity42 grew just 4.4 % in april - june , it 's slowest pace for four and a half years " the august reading was grim , " @entity46 chief economist for @entity2 @entity47 said in a note			1
" coupled with the july reading it seems clear that the economy is continuing to slow and that last week 's april - june gdp number was not the bottom			2
" he said the recovery in growth would prove to be a drawn - out affair and would be tainted by the lingering balance of payment challenges			2
" politics may get in the way of meaningful progress on structural reform , " he said			0
" unfortunately , we think the slowdown has further to go , which presents greater challenges for policymakers as they try to stabilize the currency			0
" the threat of a @entity72 strike on @entity73 has put pressure on oil prices and on gold -- two of @entity2 's biggest dollar - indexed imports -- in the short - term , but analysts say that @entity2 's currency woes can only be stabilized by addressing long - term fundamentals			1
@entity2 , they say , could follow three scenarios , none very attractive			1
let the rupee fall it could allow the currency to fall further , boosting exports and helping close the current - account deficit , as @entity1 's speech suggested			1
nevertheless , with a small manufacturing base mired in red tape , analysts say it does not have the critical mass to respond quickly			1
with balance of payments taking time to turn around , investors would likely panic in the meantime further depressing business			0
a weaker currency would also likely stoke inflation , increase the government subsidies on fuel and also its borrowing			2
boost interest rates @entity107 and @entity108 last month took measures to protect their currencies by tweaking interest rates -- a response in large measure to improving prospects for the @entity72 economy where the @entity115 looks likely to begin winding in the purchase of bonds			0
if @entity2 followed suit , @entity2 industry -- already in bad shape -- would suffer and increase the possibility of bad loans at banks too			2
corporate earnings decline would slam equity investors who currently have about $ 200 billion invested in listed shares			0
a credit crunch , say analysts , would make things worse			0
borrow less money government borrowing is running at about 7 % of @entity132 , according government figures , fueling excess demand and widening the current account deficit			1
with its appetite for lavish and populist government programs , spending cuts are difficult			1
it 's latest ambitious food program -- the $ 25 billion annually food security bill -- is likely to impact the economy heavily			0
but economists are saying that once all the provisions of the bill are priced in , it will cost much more			0
@entity148 of @entity149 told @entity0 the cost could easily go up a further half a percentage point of gdp			0
" if you look at an incremental cost of 0.5 % , the total cost would then be 1.5 % of gdp which is large by any standard , " he said			0
raise taxes like @entity158 , @entity2 may have to look at raising tax revenues			2
with just 3 % of @entity2 paying income tax , analysts say that tax increases would have to fall on the formal economy which is already taking a big hit in the current economic climate			1
@entity166 , co-chief investment officer at @entity167 , told @entity0 the rupee 's immediate fate , however , lies in the hands of the central bank " i think this is the dilemma of the central bank , " he said			0
" we 've seen this half - hearted attempt to stabilize the currency -- they came at it from different levels			0
but because it was half - hearted and the currency depreciated after that we have seen panic reaction from corporates and institutional investors			0
" clearly at a certain level the market has to get convinced that the central bank has enough power fire power to stabilize the currency			0
once the market gets that kind of conviction , you will see the rupee again appreciating by 7 % to 8 % very quickly			2

@entity2 looks for the *upside* to the rupee crisis - that it will boost exports
analysts say its industrial base is too small and too bound up in red tape to respond quickly
@entity2 still relies heavily on populist , capital - *intensive* government programs
government borrowing is fueling excess demand and widening the current account deficit .
