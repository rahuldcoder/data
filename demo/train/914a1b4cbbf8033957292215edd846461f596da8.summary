@entity0 -- a day after @entity4 gov. @entity3 apologized for mishandling tuesday 's snowfall , which paralyzed @entity0 and resulted in commutes that exceeded 20 hours for some people , temperatures rose above freezing friday and the city too busy to hate moved on			2
" i 've gotten the message loud and clear and i 'm going to act like it and do something about it , " mayor @entity9 told reporters at the @entity11			1
@entity9 said he would be more aggressive in handling any future events , even if that means using his bully pulpit to persuade others not under his authority to act			1
" i 'm going to publicly say that the city of @entity0 is closing and we believe everybody in the city should close right away , and anybody who does n't agree , they can take my seat on @entity1			2
" that was an apparent reference to a testy interview @entity9 had wednesday with @entity1 's @entity30			1
@entity9 acknowledged that the image of his city has taken a hit in the public eye , but predicted it would rebound			1
" i think we 'll earn it back , day by day , and i 'm confident that there will be a severe weather event and we 'll be able to show that we have the ability to respond			1
" on friday , the last of the more than 2,000 cars that were abandoned when 2.6 inches of snow overwhelmed @entity0 's ability to cope were being picked up by their owners			1
by friday morning , only about a dozen were left on interstates and state roads , said @entity47 , a spokesman for @entity4 's @entity48			1
government help , which many said was impossible to find in the immediate aftermath of the storm , was available thursday , when the @entity53 and @entity54 offered free rides to abandoned cars , five free gallons of gas and a jump - start			1
on thursday night , the state began towing -- at state expense -- unclaimed cars			2
the @entity63 said it would waive impounding fees for those cars it towed , though it was just one of many agencies dealing with abandoned cars			2
by sunday , the temperature should reach the 60 's in parts of the @entity73			2
political aftermath the governor also vowed to move more aggressively and more quickly before any future storms , even if that means more false alarms			1

" i got this one wrong , " @entity97 @entity96 said			0

monster sprawl @entity9 has managerial control over most , but not all , of @entity111			1
but greater @entity0 comprises 28 counties with 140 cities and towns sprawled over an area the size of @entity117 , and @entity9 does not have administrative power over them			1
that needs to change , according to retired lt. gen. @entity121 , who coordinated relief efforts along the @entity123 after @entity124			0
" they need to have in @entity0 the same type of government you have in @entity129 , where the mayor controls the city and everything around that city , and the mayor can make decisions on road closures ; he has emergency powers as when schools close , " he said			1
@entity0 's transportation system is fragile though warmth may have returned to @entity0 , its residents still ca n't count on a reasonable commute			0
the city 's subway -- called @entity146 -- does not reach many areas of the city , so the vast majority of commuters drive			0
that often means traffic jams during rush hours , which can extend through much of the day			0

the average @entity0 driver is stuck in traffic for 43 hours per year ; that 's in addition to his or her normal commuting time , it said			0
