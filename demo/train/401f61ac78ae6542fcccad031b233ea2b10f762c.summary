-- @entity1 have voted , and they have overwhelmingly chosen to stay the course on @entity4 integration			2
late last month , pro-european parties won a sweeping victory in parliamentary elections that saw allies of @entity1 president @entity9 and prime minister @entity10 come out on top			1
but while @entity4 and the @entity12 are celebrating the outcome as a strategic victory for the @entity15 , the election result itself simply builds on the slogans of last winter 's @entity19			2
the trouble is that in @entity1 , such rhetoric has all too often led to disappointment			2
of course , the @entity15 can hope that this time , @entity1 's political class will fulfill its promises			1
but as the axiom goes : @entity26 alone is not a strategy			0
indeed , @entity29 's hopes have already begun to deflate since @entity31 - backed rebels held their own elections in the self - proclaimed @entity33 of @entity34 and @entity35 , and threatened to seize further territory in @entity1 's southeast			1
to win a meaningful victory in @entity1 , therefore , the @entity15 now needs to clearly define its own interests , develop a strategy that recognizes constraints as well as opportunities to advance those interests , and deploy sufficient financial , political and military resources to put that strategy into action			1
so , how should the @entity15 start ? first , it is essential that the @entity15 define its interest in @entity1 on its own terms -- it can not simply be the opposite of what @entity31 wants			1
nor can it be just whatever @entity1 leaders say they want from one moment to the next			0
for @entity4 and @entity56 , @entity1 's future is surely about the welfare of 45 million @entity1 and the geopolitical orientation of one of @entity4 's largest countries			1
yet even more is at stake			0
the @entity15 's vital interests in @entity1 cut to the very heart of more than half a century of @entity15 security and prosperity : to sustain the credibility of the @entity15 socio - economic and political " model , " preserve a privileged , central position in the globalizing economy , and reinforce the critical infrastructure of @entity74 - @entity73 peace and security , with @entity76 at its core			1
to secure these interests in @entity1 demands a strategic approach that has so far been lacking from either @entity4 or @entity12 policies , despite abundant soaring rhetoric and political theater			2
the @entity15 socio - economic model is under assault not only in the post-soviet space , but in @entity4 itself , where economic uncertainty and social malaise are fertile ground for anti-establishment ideologues , including some overtly or covertly allied with @entity92 propagandists and flush with @entity31 cash			0
to restore and rebuild the credibility of this model , @entity94 and @entity95 should start by intervening decisively to stem the crisis at its weakest point , which is now @entity1			0
although they have embraced what they consider to be @entity15 political values , @entity1 are uncertain that they can achieve prosperity			1
the country has suffered a currency devaluation of almost 100 % with double digit gdp loss , the banking sector is functionally insolvent , and the government is perpetually on the verge of default			0
the global financial crisis that originated in the @entity15 proved that only a swift and overwhelming response can prevent panic from freezing private credit and consumer confidence exactly when they are needed most			0
@entity1 now needs far more than the roughly $ 18 billion so far offered by the @entity116 and @entity15 governments to avert disaster			1
the real figure may be closer to $ 50 billion in the next year , money that should be offered on credit to give markets full confidence in @entity1 's future , but with the tightest possible controls so the country 's notoriously corrupt officials and oligarchs can not siphon it to pad their private accounts			1
meanwhile , the @entity15 's " targeted " and " sectoral " sanctions against @entity31 have had so little immediate impact on the @entity31 economy that they are unlikely to prevent further @entity31 intervention in @entity1 , which the @entity92 views as a vital to its domestic political survival			1
at the same time , the @entity15 's decision to exploit its privileged position in the global economy to punish @entity31 may be exactly the push that @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and others need to begin seriously hedging -- limiting dollar and euro transactions , while shifting away from @entity15 service providers , middlemen and lenders			2
a smart strategy would couple each punitive sanction on the @entity92 elite with positive incentives for closer engagement with ordinary @entity31 , as well as small and medium sized @entity31 businesses , such as reduced barriers to travel and favorable financing			0
it would also entail steps to enhance the appeal of the current global trading and financial system for rising economies in @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 , above all offering them influence commensurate with their growing prosperity			0
against such a strategy , an iron - fisted @entity92 response -- closing @entity31 off to the @entity15 and leaning on others to do the same -- would quickly alienate both the @entity31 people and the wider world			0
the @entity15 's vital interest in secure , stable borders in the @entity74 - @entity73 region is imperiled not only in @entity1 itself , but among @entity76 members like @entity177 and the @entity178 , which fear that hybrid and asymmetric warfare tactics developed by @entity31 - backed forces in @entity1 may soon be tried out on them			1
the september @entity76 summit in @entity183 and @entity12 president @entity185 's visit to @entity186 announced steps to reassure these allies , but the seeds of future conflict persist as long as @entity31 and its close neighbors face each other with inveterate hostility and suspicion			0
@entity76 's commitment to @entity74 - @entity73 security should entail not only enhancing conventional deterrence , but also conducting a hard - nosed audit of vulnerabilities in @entity76 members ' own security establishments , politics and societies			0
@entity31 's western neighbors are now deeply and understandably concerned about potential @entity31 - backed " fifth columns " in their midst , but they can not turn a blind eye to nationalist strains in their domestic politics that demean or ignore the concerns of @entity31 - speaking minorities and @entity31 itself			0
@entity76 should therefore couple concrete reassurance with steps to help increase resiliency and inclusiveness in member states ' domestic politics , as well as a renewed commitment to the @entity219 as a platform for direct dialogue			0
@entity1 's @entity15 political transition is an important and historic development that can deliver far greater freedom , security and prosperity for @entity1 and the region in the long term			1
@entity4 and @entity56 stand to benefit as well -- but only if they recognize that their own vital interests are now at stake in @entity1 , and decide to take them seriously .			2

pro-european parties won solid victories in @entity1 's parliamentary polls
@entity15 must realize importance of @entity1 to its interests : @entity240
@entity240 : @entity15 must help @entity1 shore up its economy
