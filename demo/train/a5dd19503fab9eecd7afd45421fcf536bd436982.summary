-- @entity1 was known as @entity2 until 1868 , but it 's hard to imagine that this high - rise , high - tech metropolis could possibly have existed in a time before electricity and concrete			1
@entity1 is n't just a futuristic city ; it 's the place that has shaped our vision of what the future will look like			1
in @entity1 , the future is a long - standing tradition			1
there 's a sci - fi familiarity to areas like @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 ; the skyscrapers glowing with illuminated signs , subway stops inside shopping malls and taxis with automated doors could be straight out of " @entity28 " or " @entity29			1
" but the space - age topography of @entity1 has been shaped by a history of catastrophe			1
in the 20th century alone @entity1 suffered earthquakes , fires and devastating bombing			0
the result is a city that has repeatedly been forced to rebuild , shedding its past with each successive redevelopment			0
in @entity1 , the future is a long - standing tradition			1
after centuries of expansion , @entity1 has grown vertically to accommodate its 12 million residents			0
perhaps the inevitability of another catastrophic earthquake accounts for the lack of emotional attachment to the city 's architecture ; buildings are continuously being pulled down and replaced , creating the sensation that @entity1 's skyline is a permanent work in progress			1
while it can seem that the city is intent on stream rolling over its past , you can still see traces of old @entity2			2
the @entity61 tells of the city 's @entity63 heritage and there 's something timeless about the charming chaos of @entity68			2
even the enduring formalities of @entity1 's social etiquette and the joy with which @entity72 greet the coming of the cherry blossom are signs that the city maintains a lingering affection for its traditions			2
at first glance , @entity72 may seem sober and industrious , efficiently going about the business of making their city a world capital of techno commerce , but shops filled with manga comics and anime @entity87 hint at a desire to escape the obligations of real life			0
that appetite for escapism is most colorfully expressed in the phenomenon of " cosplay " , which sees teenagers dress as characters from cartoons and comic strips , or in the outlandish uniforms of various distinctive subcultures			0
in the 80s , @entity104 's bubble economy created unsustainable growth in @entity1 and property prices in the capital went through the roof			0
when the bubble burst in the early 90s , @entity1 was hit particularly hard but , after years of recession , @entity1 has the buzz of a city regaining its confidence			0
for this endlessly fascinating city , it 's back to business -- and back to the future .			0
