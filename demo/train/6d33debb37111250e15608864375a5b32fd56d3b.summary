-- @entity1 trained for 14 months to play a biology teacher who moonlights as a mixed martial arts fighter to raise money for his school in " @entity7			1
" @entity1 said training included working out three times a day , drinking greens , running and sparring			1
yet , he was moving pretty slowly when he dropped by @entity0 last week			2
" i threw my back out ... getting into a town car			2
that 'll show you the kind of shape i 'm in now			2
how far i 've let myself go , " the self - deprecating comic said			1
@entity1 co-wrote and co-produced the action comedy , which hits theaters on friday			1
it 's already garnering positive feedback			2
among his favorite early viewer reactions : " @entity26 forgive me , i think i honestly liked this @entity1 movie			1
" some people have the idea that " @entity7 " is " just going to be @entity29 falling around a ring , being the fat guy , tripping over his own feet , " @entity1 said			1
" but the @entity32 gave us their blessing to make this movie			2
... i had to promise them i 'm going to make this thing as realistic as possible and it 's going to be something that they have n't seen in me before			2
" as several @entity42 sites have reported , this is the first film that 's actually been allowed to use the @entity32 brand name			2
so far it seems @entity42 fans like the way the sport is represented			2
@entity50 's @entity49 wrote , " i can appreciate all the cameos made by @entity32 personalities and fighters , whether they play themselves or not and there are a lot of fight scenes with superman punches , @entity59 locks and body shots			1
" since " @entity61 , " @entity1 has made a name for himself in the @entity64 arena , headlining family films like " @entity29 : @entity29 " and " @entity66			1
" and then there are his @entity64 endeavors , which include ensemble comedies like " hitch , " " @entity70 " and " @entity71			2
" despite some critical reviews , @entity1 ' flicks have consistently performed well at the box office			1
as @entity75 reported after " @entity66 's " 2011 release , 41 % of moviegoers listed " actor in a leading role " as their reason for seeing the flick about talking animals			2
@entity1 said he does n't feel the need to defend his recent films , and he wo n't apologize for playing " the goofy guy falling down			1
" " i love doing it , " he said			0
" it cracks me up sometimes what people will say about ' @entity29 , ' " the 2009 flick he co-wrote and starred in as a @entity94 - riding security guard at a @entity96 mall			1
" this is for families and for kids			0
" " @entity7 " is a very different kind of physical comedy , full of knockouts and arm bars			1
everything that happens in the film is something that has happened during a real @entity42 fight , @entity1 said , noting , " there was a ring that broke			1
a guy got thrown through the ring			0
there was a rain fight			0
these are all from real life			0
" @entity1 , who was a wrestler and a football player once upon a time , has been a fan of the @entity32 since watching the first fight in 1993			1
he said it was his " love of trying to be physical and trying to portray what these guys go through " that led him to the project			0
as for the other half of the story : " i also have teachers that i remember from when i was going to school that have inspired me , " he said			0
" i 've also had really crappy teachers , unfortunately , where they do n't really care that much and you think it 's a great time then because you 're in class ... but literally there is nothing for you later on down the road			0
i kind of just wanted to tie these two worlds together			0
" " it 's tough , " he added , " because you 're trying to blend a big comedy with inspiration , with heart and realistic fighting			1
... there are a lot of ingredients in this one			0
" @entity1 hopes audiences will enjoy the idea of a " common , everyday guy " fighting in the @entity148 for a good cause			1
" you can watch ' @entity151 ' and enjoy it because it 's something that you would never do , " he said			0
" i could never be @entity151			0
and then there are movies where you watch because you 're seeing yourself through the eyes of the character			0
and i think i 'm the latter			0
" part of @entity1 ' appeal as the everyman is his size , which is occasionally written into his story lines , as fans of " @entity61 " already know			1
while he said he does n't mind the jokes , his mother is not a fan			0
" if i do a movie where i have to have ( a son ) and it 's a chubby kid , my mother is always like , ' you were never like that			0
' she gets so upset about it , " he said			0
it 's his own kids , who are 7 , 5 and 17 months , who have greatly influenced his professional decisions			1
" i want to do movies that i 'm proud of where my kids , at some point , can see and i can feel comfortable sitting there watching it with them , " he said			0
" and just that move people			0
that make people feel a little bit better about themselves when they leave the theater			0
" @entity1 will next appear in " @entity191 " and " @entity192 , " which is due out in july 2013			1
he 's also gearing up to star alongside @entity193 in " @entity194 , " the comedy he co-wrote about two valet parking attendants who witness a murder .			1
