-- @entity2 golfer @entity1 said he was " very lucky " after securing the biggest win of his career on sunday			1
the 29 - year - old beat @entity7 star @entity6 on the third playoff hole at the @entity9 in @entity10 to clinch the @entity12 's season - ending @entity11 and $ 11.44 million in prize money			1
@entity1 needed a dramatic save after hitting a water hazard before going on to sink a four - foot putt on the par - three 18th hole at @entity17 to finally see off his compatriot , after the duo had finished tied on eight under par through 72 holes			1
the dramatic triumph saw @entity1 -- whose father @entity23 played in the @entity7 on three occasions and won nine times on the @entity26 -- leap from 25th in the @entity11 standings to claim the $ 10 million jackpot			1
he also pocketed $ 1.44 million for winning the @entity9 , the final event in the four - tournament series , but said he was unaware of his double success until he stepped up to collect both trophies			1
" i knew i was on the line , meaning the only way i could win in my position at the start of the week was to win the tournament , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
" even with that happening i still could not win the @entity11 because other people who were way ahead of me , their points would have passed me			2
" so in my head , focus on one task -- and that was to win this playoff -- and whatever happens after that , happens			2
the chips fell my way and i 'm very lucky			0
" it looked like @entity1 had blown his shot at glory when he hit a bogey and double bogey on the final two holes of saturday 's third round to lose a share of the lead , but a 68 on sunday allowed him to haul himself back up the leaderboard			1
it then looked as if nerves might get the better of @entity1 when the playoff began , as he hit a loose shot into the crowd on the first additional hole before finding the water on the second			1
but the new world number 20 found the green with a stunning shot to force a third playoff hole , where his par putt proved enough for victory			2
" when i got up there i 'd heard the groans from the crowd , " @entity1 said of the build - up to his incredible saving shot			1
" i thought it was in the water , so i get up there and it is somewhat in the water			0
" but it 's not fully submerged , so in my head i said to myself , ' i do have some sort of shot here			0
' i hit the shot i thought i had to hit , and it came out perfect			0
" @entity1 has also put himself in contention for the upcoming @entity91 clash between the @entity2 and an international team starting on november 14 , with @entity2 captain @entity93 due to announce his final wildcard pick on tuesday			1
" i 'm not going to say it gets me to @entity101 , " @entity1 told the @entity26 's official website regarding the possibility of playing in the competition , which takes place in @entity99			2
" it definitely puts me in the talk up there with some of the guys that everybody has been talking about			0
" @entity1 hopes to use this win as a springboard for the rest of his career as he looks to match some of the illustrious names who have previously clinched the @entity11			1
" it 's pretty sweet			0
you look at the names who have previously won this , i 'm trying to work my way to their stature and their level of play			0
this is just another stepping stone , i think i can get up there , " he said			0
" it 'll take a lot of work			0
guys like @entity130 ( @entity131 ) , @entity132 and @entity133 , obviously they 've put their time in , they 've put their work in and i need to do the same			0
i 've got to work hard to try and get better each and every year			0
" @entity6 thought he had the tournament sewn up after @entity1 ended up in the water , but the 29 - year - old admitted @entity1 was in the ascendancy once his magnificent recovery shot fell close to the hole			1
" i thought i had one on the second playoff hole and then he hits it out of the water to two feet , " @entity6 said			2
" it seemed like he was destined to win this week			0
" world number one @entity148 knew a win at this event would be enough for him to claim the @entity11 , and in the process become the first man to top both the @entity12 and @entity154 money lists			1
the @entity155 birdied three of the last five holes to finish one shot behind @entity1 and @entity6 , in a three - way tie for third position along with @entity161 's @entity160 and @entity101 @entity162			1
" i guess this is what the @entity11 is all about , " said @entity148 , who would have claimed victory in the series if he had finished alone in third			1
" it 's meant to be exciting			0
" @entity101 @entity168 fell away in the final two holes of the final round after he hit two bogeys to slide from eight under to finish in a tie for sixth place alongside compatriot @entity175 and @entity2 @entity176 " obviously i 'm a little disappointed that i bogeyed the last two holes , " day , 23 , said			2
" but i was trying to win out there			0
