trying to figure out how the @entity6 and its @entity8 allies will respond to @entity11 's @entity10 incursion gets confusing			1
the tense showdown over @entity14 sovereignty offers few easy answers , with differing priorities between @entity0 and the @entity17 adding to the confusion			1
here is a look at where @entity22 allies stand : military @entity6 -- it is hard to imagine a scenario that would cause @entity6 troops to get involved in @entity14			1
at the same time , the @entity29 administration ca n't rule out any option as it pushes for direct negotiations between @entity11 and @entity14 aimed at de-escalating the current crisis and laying the groundwork for peaceful coexistence going forward			1
the @entity35 has announced the addition of six @entity38 fighter planes to the four currently on a @entity40 mission in the @entity41			0
previously , @entity0 halted ongoing military cooperation with @entity11			2
after a series meetings wednesday with @entity8 , @entity14 and @entity11 counterparts in @entity46 , secretary of state @entity43 told reporters that " all parties agreed today that it is important to try to resolve the issues through dialogue			1
" he added : " they do n't believe that any of us are served by greater or further confrontation			0
" @entity8 -- the last thing the @entity17 wants is an armed conflict in its backyard			1
only if @entity11 forces moved into eastern @entity14 would consideration be given to bolstering @entity40 forces in neighboring countries			2
while no obligation exists for @entity40 to militarily defend @entity14 against @entity11 aggression , the @entity6 and @entity65 -- along with @entity11 -- committed to protecting @entity14 independence and territorial integrity in 1994 when @entity68 gave up its nuclear arsenal that dated back to the @entity71 era			1
what happens now to @entity14 will have an impact on nuclear nonproliferation programs elsewhere , @entity14 interim prime minister @entity72 warned thursday			0
his implication was clear : failure to effectively respond to @entity11 's aggression in @entity10 would embolden @entity79 and @entity80 to further resist @entity22 efforts to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons			0
sanctions the @entity6 -- president @entity29 said thursday that he signed an executive order that laid the groundwork for sanctions against people and entities deemed responsible for the crisis			2
the executive order provides the legal basis for sanctions against specific people and entities , but @entity95 spokesman @entity94 later told reporters no individuals were specifically targeted			0
@entity99 bans are already in effect for some @entity11 and @entity14 officials , and the freezing of assets and property could be forthcoming			2
the moves fall short of broader economic sanctions aimed at @entity11 's state - owned banks and energy industry sought by some in @entity110			2
" this action by @entity11 can not go unchallenged , " @entity111 rep. @entity111 of @entity112 , the chairman of the @entity113 , said thursday at a hearing where the panel approved a non-binding resolution backing sanctions			0
@entity8 -- closer proximity to @entity11 and crucial economic ties make the issue of sanctions more difficult for @entity8 countries			1
already , @entity11 threatens to retaliate with its own sanctions if the @entity6 and @entity8 take such a step			1
@entity11 is the @entity17 's third - biggest trading partner after the @entity6 and @entity125 , with goods and services worth more than $ 500 billion exchanged in 2012			1
about 75 % of all foreign direct investment in @entity11 originates in @entity17 member states , according to the @entity130			2
in addition , @entity11 is the single biggest supplier of energy to the @entity17			2
@entity65 energy firm @entity134 is the second - largest shareholder in @entity11 's leading oil producer @entity136 , and some of the biggest energy companies in @entity139 , the @entity140 and @entity141 are invested in a joint venture with @entity11 gas giant @entity143			0
" if and when any sanctions are placed on @entity11 , they are likely to be targeted on key officials rather than on the wider economy , " said @entity144 , chief emerging markets economist at @entity145			0
" @entity8 is too dependent on @entity11 energy to countenance full - blown trade restrictions			2
" on thursday , the @entity17 threatened limited steps if no substantive negotiations between @entity11 and @entity14 start in coming days			1
@entity155 president @entity154 told reporters in @entity157 that " in any absence of results , the @entity17 will decide on additional measures such as travel bans , asset freezes , and cancellation of the @entity17 - @entity11 summit			2
" later , @entity43 told reporters that no serious gap existed between the @entity6 and @entity17 approaches , adding that " there may be some differences of opinion about timing or about one choice over another			0
" aid @entity6 -- @entity43 announced $ 1 billion in loan guarantees for @entity14 this week as part of the @entity29 administration 's effort to publicly support the interim government and provide incentive for @entity14 to continue to align itself with the @entity180 through the @entity17 instead of @entity11			1
@entity29 called thursday for @entity110 to support assistance for the @entity14 government from both the @entity6 and the @entity183			0
a few hours later , the @entity111 - led @entity95 overwhelmingly approved an aid package to authorize the previously announced loan guarantees			1
such support offers a trifecta of being unilateral , enjoying political support at home and backing the goal of bolstering @entity14			0
@entity8 -- the @entity17 announced wednesday it will offer @entity14 at least $ 15 billion in aid as the country struggles with dwindling cash and the military standoff with @entity11			1
the package would provide @entity14 with assistance over the next few years , said @entity197 , the head of the @entity17 's executive body , the @entity130			1
on wednesday , @entity14 said it would be unable to pay its february natural gas bill to @entity143			0
@entity8 aid is the easiest way to show immediate support for @entity14 while avoiding risks of counter-sanctions and other retaliation			0
diplomacy @entity6 -- the @entity6 is working with @entity8 allies to create an " exit ramp " for @entity209 to be able to de-escalate the @entity14 crisis			1
their plan would call for @entity11 troops in @entity10 to return to their barracks , and international observers to come to @entity14 to monitor the situation on the ground , where @entity11 complains of persecution against ethnic @entity11			0
in addition , the @entity6 seeks to isolate @entity11 diplomatically , joining other members of the @entity222 group of industrial powers in pulling out of preparatory meetings for the scheduled june summit in @entity226 , @entity11			0
the foundation of the @entity6 stance is for @entity14 to maintain its independence and territorial integrity , while also recognizing @entity11 's historical and economic ties to @entity14			1
@entity29 said thursday he was " confident " that the international community was " moving forward together " in responding to what he called the @entity11 intervention			0
@entity8 -- @entity139 chancellor @entity236 spoke with @entity29 on tuesday about the diplomatic exit ramp , but initial indications thursday showed little progress with @entity11 on agreement			0
reflecting the standoff , @entity236 said thursday that the @entity17 wants to do everything it can to settle the @entity14 crisis diplomatically , but she warned that without any " diplomatic possibility , " steps such as asset freezing and visa limitations would be options			1
@entity250 's @entity249 , @entity251 and @entity252 and @entity1 's @entity253 contributed to this report .			0

where do @entity0 and the @entity17 stand on the @entity14 crisis ?
no one wants an armed conflict , especially in the @entity17 's backyard
@entity8 's economic ties with @entity11 make it less likely to back strong sanctions
