@entity0 -- secretary of state @entity2 said friday that @entity4 's announcement of new settlement construction in disputed territory in @entity7 was " insulting " to the @entity8			1
the @entity4 announcement came during vice president @entity11 's visit this week to @entity4			1
it complicated @entity8 efforts to set up so - called proximity talks between the @entity4 and @entity15 , the latest attempt to nudge the two sides back toward talking directly			1
@entity18 said the @entity8 ' relationship with @entity4 is not at risk : " our relationship is durable			2
it 's rooted in common values			0
" " but we have to make clear to our @entity4 friends and partners that the two - state solution -- which we support , which the prime minister himself says he supports -- requires confidence - building measures on both sides , " @entity18 told @entity1 's @entity25			0
" and the announcement of the settlements the very day that the vice president was there was insulting			2
" the construction , announced tuesday , will be in the @entity40 neighborhood , in disputed territory in @entity7			1
the @entity4 @entity42 denies that the territory is in @entity7			2
@entity11 arrived in @entity4 on monday , meeting first with @entity4 president @entity44 at his official residence in @entity7 and then with prime minister @entity46			1
@entity11 emphasized the close relationship between the @entity8 and @entity4 as he met with @entity4 leaders tuesday , a visit that also touched on relations with the @entity15 and @entity51			1
however , later tuesday , after getting word of the settlement announcement , @entity11 said the @entity8 condemned @entity4 's decision to build 1,600 housing units in the @entity7 neighborhood , calling it " a step that undermines the trust we need right now			1
" the @entity4 @entity42 said the construction plan was approved by a district committee , and the public can express objections to it over the next 60 days			0
" i mean , it was just really a very unfortunate and difficult moment for everyone -- the @entity8 , our vice president who had gone to reassert our strong support for @entity4 security -- and i regret deeply that that occurred and made that known , " @entity18 said friday			1
she added that she has no reason to believe that @entity46 knew about the announcement during @entity11 's visit but added , " he is the prime minister			1
like the president or secretary of state ... ultimately , you are responsible			0
" the controversy over @entity4 's announcement came just a day after the @entity84 administration 's special envoy for @entity86 peace announced that @entity4 and @entity15 leaders had accepted indirect talks			1
@entity88 said monday that the two sides , with him acting as intermediary , had begun to discuss the " structure and scope " of the talks			0
" i will return to the region next week to continue our discussions , " @entity88 said			0
" as we 've said many times , we hope that these will lead to direct negotiations as soon as possible			0
" negotiations between @entity15 and @entity4 have been stalled for more than a year , despite the @entity84 administration 's attempt to move toward a resolution of the decades - old @entity4 - @entity15 conflict			2
under current agreements between @entity4 and the @entity106 , @entity4 maintains full control over the @entity108 and its borders while the @entity15 government oversees administration of major population centers			2
speaking at a @entity114 convention in @entity7 on monday , @entity46 said he welcomes " the initiation of the peace process between us and the @entity15			0
" " we have been calling to resume the talks without prior conditions for almost a year now , " he said			0
