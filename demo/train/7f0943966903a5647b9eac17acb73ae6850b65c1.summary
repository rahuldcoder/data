-- federal and state authorities wo n't say specifically why , but they think a letter purported to be from a @entity7 teenager missing for nearly two months might in fact be the real thing			1
@entity9 was last seen on october 9 , according to the @entity10 , as she headed home from her high school in the town of @entity14 , and officials fear she might be held against her will			1
" we are concerned for her safety , " @entity7 associate attorney general @entity17 said friday at a news conference called to discuss the search for the girl			1
" she is not out there alone			0
she has somebody who is either helping her , whether that be a friend or what we fear is a foe			0
" at the news conference , authorities revealed that @entity9 's mother , @entity31 , received a letter on november 6 that appeared to be from her missing daughter			1
that letter was kept secret until friday , said @entity35 , because " law enforcement had to take every possible step to verify its authenticity			2
" and at this juncture , we believe in fact that it was written by @entity42 and was sent to her mother , " @entity35 added			1
neither federal nor state authorities would discuss the contents of the letter beyond @entity35 saying the writing is in " a tone @entity42 would have used , " and that the letter underwent " expert analysis " before its existence was announced publicly			1
officials also said revealing details about the letter could potentially trigger " copycat " letters that would slow down the investigation			0
the letter was written on october 22 , and postmarked on october 23 , according to @entity35 , and it was turned over to authorities for investigation after @entity31 received it nearly two weeks after it was postmarked			1
" when we received this letter i will tell you it was unprecedented			0
we have not seen anything like that in recent times in other investigations , but most importantly , it gave us hope , " @entity10 special agent @entity65 said at the news conference			0
neither the girl 's mother nor the rest of her family has had any contact with @entity9 since the letter 's arrival , said @entity35			1
authorities said @entity9 had no source of income , and on the day she disappeared she did not have winter clothes with her			2
police released photos of a pocketbook and a necklace that were believed to be with the teen when she went missing			0
officials from several law enforcement agencies asked that members of the community be vigilant and pay attention to their surroundings , in the hopes that someone will spot @entity9 and alert authorities			1
" we are asking you look at your neighbor			0
look at the girls next door			0
is there somebody that you have n't seen before ? " @entity35 said on friday			0
initially authorities believed @entity9 's disappearance may have been an abduction , and continue to believe that she may be being held against her will , but nevertheless they are continuing to classify it as a missing persons case , as all possibilities have not yet been ruled out , according to @entity65			2
information and tips on @entity9 's disappearance are still flowing in from members of the community and law enforcement officials asked that anyone with knowledge of @entity9 's whereabouts contact authorities			2
" we need to reunite this child with her family , " concluded @entity35 .			0
