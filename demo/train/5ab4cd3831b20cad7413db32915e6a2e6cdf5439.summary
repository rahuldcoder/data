@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity4 's heated showdown this week over claims of a conspiracy to conceal president @entity8 's true birthplace was , at its core , an argument about lying			1
@entity4 and other " birthers " believe the president , mainstream media outlets , the courts and the state of @entity17 are all lying , conspiring in a cover - up that began with @entity8 's birth announcement in a @entity21 newspaper in 1961			2
those who maintain the president was born in @entity17 -- and has produced an authentic birth certificate to prove it -- believe @entity4 and the other side are willfully ignoring the facts in front of them and spreading lies for political gain			1
despite a frustrated @entity33 , @entity32 ' birthers ' still persist " it 's very complicated , the way we process information , " said @entity34 , an organizational psychology professor at @entity35 speaking broadly about the nature of lying			2
" it 's the politics of audacity			2
the more outrageous and audacious the lie is , the more people say ' that 's got to be true because why would someone make something like that up ? ' " while many politicians are truthful , honest public servants , too many politicians and their surrogates often lie , and voters often let them get away with it , @entity34 contends			1
in the world of politics , lies are that relative no one really likes but everyone reluctantly invites to @entity62 dinner			1
from @entity69 -- " i 'm not a crook " -- to @entity64 -- " i did not have sexual relations with that woman , @entity66 " -- to @entity67 -- " it 's all made up ... i do n't know what happened " -- to @entity71 -- " the story is false ... it 's completely untrue , ridiculous " -- @entity75 politicians have had a history of political deception , or at least stretching the truth			1
@entity71 not guilty on one count ; mistrial on other charges in 2007 , @entity71 , who at the time was a leading candidate for president , lied about his mistress and baby when the @entity85 caught him at the @entity86 visiting the child			1
the jury in his conspiracy and illegal campaign contributions trial thursday found @entity71 not guilty on one of six counts			1
the judge declared a mistrial on the other five counts			0
and last year , disgraced congressman @entity96 looked @entity1 's @entity2 in the eye and lied when confronted with evidence of illicit @entity100 photos			0
he later admitted the deception and resigned from office			1
birther satire : prove @entity104 's not a unicorn " from a leadership perspective , so often the lies politicians are involved in are part of leaving an impression about information , " @entity34 said			1
" so much of it is the little white lies that are part of the social fabric			1
but when it crosses the line that the public truly believes is important , then it becomes a big problem			0
" rep. @entity120 , @entity121 , found himself straddling the line between deception , confusion and evasion after reports leaked that he questioned the president 's citizenship at a recent fundraiser			1
" i do n't know whether @entity8 was born in the @entity75			0
i do n't know that , " @entity130 reportedly said			0
" but i do know this , that in his heart , he 's not an @entity75			1
he 's just not an @entity75			0
" why does @entity135 continue to put up with @entity4 ? the ensuing media storm over @entity130 's comments forced the congressman to backpedal and issue a statement that he does believe @entity8 is an @entity75 citizen but that the president does n't share the lawmaker 's belief in " @entity75 exceptionalism			0
" but @entity130 's gaffe seems to fall more along the lines of what some behavioral experts call a dodge or an evade			0
" most dodgers , they 're not lying			0
they just create a false impression , " said @entity152 , an associate business professor at the @entity153 who studies how and why people lie			0
" occasionally politicians get caught in a lie , but it 's quite rare			1
if they are doing their jobs they do n't lie , they just evade			0
" the @entity163 - winning @entity162 website has made its mark by grading the shades of accuracy in politicians ' statements on the " @entity169			2
" " i think voters are well aware that politicians stretch the truth -- sometimes to the breaking point , " said @entity174 , editor of @entity162 and @entity0 bureau chief of the @entity176			1
" and i think voters are also savvy enough to realize there are shades of gray that turn a seemingly accurate statement into a half truth			2
" however , unlike the days when webs of political deception were tougher to untangle , savvy voters now have more tools on hand			1
" what 's different today is that there is so much information available to help people make sense of the political discourse and discern the difference between an exaggeration and a pants - on - fire lie , " @entity174 said			2
when @entity198 , who was seeking the @entity200 chairmanship , declared " a large majority of the @entity33 believes that ( @entity8 ) is a @entity202 and was born in a foreign country , was not born in the @entity75 , " at the @entity204 last month , the would - be chairman rated a " false " on the @entity169			0
similarly , most claims about the president 's birthplace as @entity209 and the falsity of his @entity212 birth certificate rate a flaming " @entity205 " on the @entity169			0
not that any of those ratings will convince @entity4 , those who agree with him or those who believe the president was born in @entity75			0
and it does n't matter how much or how hard either side defends their position , @entity152 said			0
" we 're much more likely to notice evasive behavior with politicians we already disagree with , " @entity152 said			2
" but we forget people in our party are doing the same thing			0

at the heart of the " birther " controversy is an argument about political lies
psychologists say politicians stretching the truth is " part of the social fabric "
@entity69 , @entity64 and @entity71 have all been caught up in political deception
