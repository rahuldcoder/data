@entity0 -- the @entity2 hopes cool , careful language will keep the @entity5 crisis from boiling over			1
the @entity2 has been vocal in condemning @entity5 for what it calls an act of aggression and provocation in the march 26 sinking of a @entity13 warship that killed 46 sailors			1
but you wo n't hear @entity2 officials call this " an act of war			1
" in fact , from president @entity22 on down the chain of command in this latest @entity13 crisis , the word " war " is missing in action			1
@entity22 set the tone , offering support and condolences to the @entity13 in march			1
once an international investigation concluded last week that the patrol ship @entity35 was sunk by a @entity5 torpedo , a @entity32 statement called the ship sinking " an act of aggression ... one more instance of @entity5 's unacceptable behavior and defiance of international law			1
" secretary of state @entity44 hit the same notes during her trip to @entity47			2
" we are working hard to avoid an escalation , belligerence and provocation , " @entity48 said monday			1
" this is a highly precarious situation that the @entity5 have caused in the region and it is one that every country that neighbors or is in proximity to @entity5 understands must be contained			2
" @entity0 is standing with @entity13 's decision to halt trade agreements with @entity5			1
the @entity2 also is emphasizing -- in both words and deeds -- its military ties to @entity13 , including an announcement monday at the @entity65 that the @entity2 and @entity13 militaries would conduct joint anti-submarine exercises			1
and the administration is holding its @entity13 ally close			2
@entity48 will be in @entity70 on wednesday , and defense secretary @entity71 will meet his counterpart in coming weeks , while @entity22 will see @entity13 president @entity73 at the @entity75 conference of developed countries in @entity77 in june			2
but while @entity32 press secretary @entity78 said monday that @entity2 support for the defense of @entity13 is " unequivocal , " he did n't mention war			1
" specifically , we endorse president @entity73 's demand that @entity5 immediately apologize and punish those responsible for the attack , and , most importantly , stop its belligerent and threatening behavior , " @entity78 said in a prepared statement			2
@entity5 has denied it was responsible for the march 26 sinking and has threatened to back out of a nonaggression pact between the two @entity92			1
despite that pact and the 1953 armistice that ended the @entity95 , the @entity96 technically remain at war			0
and @entity5 has a huge standing army ; it bristles with missiles and has tested nuclear weapons twice , in 2006 and 2009			0
@entity102 spokesman @entity101 said last week the sinking of the ship was a violation of the armistice , but he chose the phrase " act of aggression			2
" " as we 've made clear , this was a clear and compelling violation of the existing armistice			0
it was without doubt a hostile act			0
i think our characterizations are broadly consistent , " @entity101 said			0
over at the @entity65 , @entity71 and adm. @entity119 , chairman of the @entity120 , both sidestepped questions about whether what @entity5 did constitutes an act of war			1
" well , first of all , we certainly support the findings of the @entity13 -- the @entity13 investigation , " @entity71 said last week			0
" we obviously are in close consultation with the @entity5			0
the attack was against one of their ships			0
and we will -- naturally they would have the lead in determining the path forward			0
they 've laid out some paths forward , and we will be consulting very closely with them as we move ahead			0
" @entity119 was equally evasive			0
" certainly we 're concerned about it			0
we 've helped them in the investigation , and we agree with the conclusion			0
they 're a great friend and great ally , and we 'll continue to do that , " @entity119 said			0
@entity147 , a fellow at the @entity148 , told @entity1 , " if you respond to bombastic rhetoric with equally hot rhetoric , chances are this could escalate			0
" " this is a very sensitive period , " @entity147 said in a telephone interview			1
" you have to be very careful in forming a response because @entity5 is so unpredictable			1
you do n't want this crisis to develop into all - out war			0
" and @entity158 , a northeast @entity159 analyst at conservative think tank the @entity160 , said avoidance of the phrase " act of war " is both a question of how legal experts may evaluate what happened according to international rules -- and one of caution about fanning the flames			2
" it may be both definitional as well as concerns about inflammatory language , " @entity158 said			0
he said the @entity2 was taking an appropriate tack in supporting @entity13			1
but he pointed out that the @entity13 themselves , outraged by the ship 's sinking and loss of life , are treading carefully			1
" the @entity13 people are angry , but not angry enough to bring about an all - out war on the @entity182 , " @entity158 said .			2

term " act of war " is missing in @entity2 response to sinking of @entity13 warship
@entity44 : @entity2 " working hard to avoid an escalation , belligerence and provocation "
@entity5 has denied responsibility for the march 26 sinking of ship
" this is a very sensitive period . you have to be very careful , " analyst says of situation
