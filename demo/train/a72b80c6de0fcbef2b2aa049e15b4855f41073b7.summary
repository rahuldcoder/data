-- you probably never met @entity2			1
i never met him either			2
and , sadly , now he 's gone			2
@entity5 left this world last saturday			1
of course , there 's no real reason why any of us should know @entity5			1
he 's just some guy from @entity10 , @entity11			2
though i say that with complete reverence			2
" just some guy " is usually the one who helps you fix the lawn mower			2
@entity17 looks after your dog			2
or loans you his truck so you can go to @entity20 and buy 80 cases of pudding and maybe some lobster dip			2
a truck would be helpful			2
but while most of the world never got to meet the man , now , thanks to the @entity30 , countless thousands know his name			2
and it 's all because of one of the greatest obituaries ever written			2
when @entity36 sat down to eulogize her father there was no way she 'd know her words would go viral			1
generally speaking , obituaries do n't get wildly passed around online , for they tend to lack cats			1
" he would n't know what going viral means , " @entity46 told the local @entity48 newspaper			1
" he would have thought that was a disease he contracted , which would have excited him to have another illness to lord over folks			2
" after all , @entity5 never lost in " competitive sickness			1
" so , @entity46 's humorous and touching obit for her dad quickly spread throughout @entity59 and other social media sites , and readers were treated to wonderful sentiments about the man she described as a foodie and a natty dresser			0
to this first point -- that of him being a foodie -- @entity46 notes his membership in the @entity71			0
the fact that this even exists should give us all hope			0
on the other hand , @entity5 also loved a martini glass filled with buttermilk , garnished with a chunk of cornbread , which does seem rather weird			1
( this , says the guy who eats dry @entity83 noodles			0
) weird or not , @entity46 added that , " as a point of pride , he purported to remember every meal he had eaten in his 80 years of life			0
" and when it came to style , there was n't a runway in the world that would have him			0
unless it was , say , an actual runway			0
" his signature everyday look was all his : a plain pocketed t - shirt designed by the fashion house @entity98 ... his black - label elastic waist shorts worn above the navel and sold exclusively at the @entity102			0
" but most importantly , @entity5 loved his grass - stained @entity104 baseball cap			1
it was kind of his thing			0
and , somehow , when you look back on a man 's life , that just sounds way better than , " yeah , @entity112 was really into @entity113			0
" not that there 's anything wrong with @entity113 -- there is n't -- but it 's sort of funny how , in the end , something like that grass - stained @entity104 baseball cap seems to matter			0
so long as it 's not too gross			0
" @entity122 wore that very same undershirt for 60 straight years			0
you could smell him from @entity127			0
" yes , just like that hat , @entity5 enjoyed the simple things in life , and he had incredible wanderlust for the natural world around him			1
@entity46 wrote that her dad traveled extensively			1
" he only stayed in the finest quality @entity136 - rated campgrounds , " the obit reads			0
" many years later he purchased a used pop - up camper for his family to travel in style , which spoiled his daughters for life			0
" but there were things that @entity5 did n't like			1
besides cats , he also could n't stand " @entity147 , " @entity146 , and daylight saving time			1
to the latter , @entity46 made sure to point out , " it is not lost on his family that he died the very day that he would have had to spring his clock forward			1
this can only be viewed as his final protest			0
" the whole obituary is filled with little gems like these , and there 's nothing i can write here that will do it any justice			1
you simply need to read it for yourself			0
when i emailed @entity46 asking for photos of her dad , she wrote me back and said , " this whole thing is surreal			1
my dad was the most authentic person i have ever known			0
it tickles me that this @entity171 has resonated with so many people			0
" and at the obituary 's conclusion , @entity46 hoped her @entity176 father could resonate , perhaps , a little more			1
it ends with a plea			0
" finally , the family asks that in honor of @entity5 that you write your congressman and ask for the repeal of @entity184			1
@entity5 wanted everyone to get back on the @entity187 's time			1
" of course , @entity189 politicians probably wo n't listen to any protests in @entity5 's name			1
he was just some guy from @entity10 , @entity11			0
