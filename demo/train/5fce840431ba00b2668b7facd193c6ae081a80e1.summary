-- " @entity1 , blown upon by mighty winds , breeder of mighty champions			1
" -- @entity5 ( 1876 - 1961 - golf writer and grandson of @entity8 naturalist @entity7 ) in 1930 , in a small corner of @entity15 's green and pleasant land , the idea for one of golf 's most desirable accoutrements was born			1
the champion golfer of the age -- @entity19 @entity18 -- won that year 's @entity20 at @entity1 , near the city of @entity22 , as the second leg of an unprecedented grand slam of championships			1
but before he would tame the winds of the @entity27 , and go on to win all four major titles on offer in a single season , @entity18 was invited to a players ' reception at the club			1
and it was this soiree that would sow the idea for @entity37 's legendary green jacket , awarded to the winner of @entity39			1
" the story goes that @entity18 was sitting next to a chap called @entity43 , who was captain of the club the year before , " @entity1 club historian @entity40 told @entity0			1
" all the captains were wearing their formal kit -- the red coats that we have			2
" @entity18 asked about it , was fascinated by it , and eventually @entity43 said to him : ' now look here @entity52 , if you win the tournament this week i 'll give you my coat			2
' " @entity57 won and he got the coat			0
" @entity60 - born @entity18 was afforded a ticker - tape parade in @entity62 when he returned in early july with the @entity20 and @entity64 titles tucked away in his locker , along with that red blazer from @entity1			1
he was the champion of a nation at a time when sport helped the @entity19 public escape the stench of poverty and despair in the wake of the @entity75			0
but his mission was only half completed			0
triumphs at the @entity78 and the @entity79 would follow , causing the @entity80 to label @entity18 ' achievement " the most triumphant journey that any man ever traveled in sport			2
" having completed what was known as " the impregnable quadrilateral " at the tender age of 28 , he promptly retired , exhausted from his feats , plunging a nation and a sport into mourning			0
his next project was @entity94 , a place for him to play with his pals away from the spotlight , a course that would stage the first incarnation of @entity39 in 1934			0
three years later @entity37 members started wearing green jackets to make themselves identifiable to patrons , and in 1949 it was decided that year 's victor , and all the previous champions , would be issued with their own version too			1
" it 's a wonderful link for our golf club to have and the @entity39 is one of golf 's great events , " @entity40 says			1
" that red jacket is now at @entity18 ' home course -- the @entity113 -- in a part of their museum which is called the @entity117			1
" we have a wonderful reciprocation with their club , a lot of their members are members at @entity1 and we have four or five who are members there			2
" @entity18 headed for @entity1 having secured the first leg of his historic quadruple at the home of golf -- @entity130 's in @entity131 -- the week before			1
that made him a nine - time major champion and one of the most talked - about sportsmen of the day			0
unsurprisingly , his arrival at @entity137 was headline news			0
" @entity18 was at the height of his fame when he came to @entity1 , " explains @entity40 , a former club captain			1
" he 'd eclipsed @entity141 and he was a phenomenal man who won 11 majors in total			0
" amateur golf was followed very closely in those days because professionals were not really socially acceptable			0
in 1930 , they were n't allowed through the front door of clubhouses			0
" @entity18 came at a time when magazines likes @entity150 and @entity151 as well as @entity152 and @entity154 newspapers covered golf			2
" for the first time sport was on the front pages and @entity18 was the hero of everybody			2
" he was a magnetic sort of bloke			0
a good - looking man with a beautiful golf swing and a wonderful temperament , very different to the bad - tempered man who arrived in 1921			0
" @entity18 had smoothed out his irascible constitution , the most famous eruption of which saw him pick up his ball and withdraw from the @entity169 at @entity130 's after a disastrous start			1
but though he exuded a confident air during the course of his four rounds in two days at @entity1 , he grappled desperately to combat the stress that plagued him on the inside			2
" he fell apart during these championships because the nerves were overwhelming , " @entity40 says			0
" he hardly ate -- he had a bit of toast and maybe a whiskey and water at the end of the day			0
he was in a right old ragged state			0
" although he looked totally supreme on the outside he was a complete wreck on the inside			0
there were a couple of @entity8 guys in contention but @entity18 ground out the last round to win by two from another @entity19 , @entity192 , and @entity193 , from @entity131			2
" it was a key part in his grand slam and we are amazingly lucky to have someone like that in our history at @entity1			1
" the links between @entity1 and one of its most illustrious champions do n't end there			0
@entity18 ' ill health meant he had to decline an offer to return for the club 's centenary celebrations in 1969 , but contained within his correspondence was another accolade			1
he noted that his first competitive round in @entity8 came at @entity1 , during the inaugural international match between the @entity8 and the @entity19 in 1921 , as did his last -- the @entity213			0
@entity18 was made an honorary member in the wake of his latter triumph -- his third , having also won the @entity20 at @entity217 and @entity218 's in 1926 and at @entity130 's the following year			1
it gave @entity1 a unique hat - trick -- the only other amateur golfers to have won prestigious tournament ( @entity223 in 1890 and @entity224 in 1892 and 1897 ) were also royal @entity22 members			2
@entity18 died in in 1971 , aged 69 , but a corner of @entity1 's clubhouse is devoted to his feat and ensures his legacy lives on .			1

@entity1 , this year 's @entity20 host , was the *inspiration* for @entity37 's green jacket
@entity18 was given a red jacket worn by captains of @entity1 on his visit in 1930
@entity18 won the @entity20 at @entity1 on his way to a famous grand slam of golf that year
the winner of the masters at @entity18 ' club in @entity37 got a green jacket from 1949
