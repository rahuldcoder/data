@entity0 printers have come a long way from their 1980s origins as machines for building prototypes for industrial engineers and architects			0
today , thanks to advances in technology and high - performance materials , they are being hailed as enablers of a " new industrial revolution			1
" the technology , which creates @entity3 objects layer by layer from 2 - @entity3 computer models , could transform manufacturing in the 21st century			1
@entity21 , director of @entity23 's @entity22 and co-author of " fabricated : @entity28 of @entity3 , " says there 's virtually no material you ca n't print with			1
" we are focusing on bio-printing and recently worked on food printing			1
now we are focusing on multi-material printing -- integrating electric wires , batteries and motors , " @entity21 said			2
" we really want to print a robot that will walk out of a printer			1
we have been able to print batteries and motors , but we have n't been able to print the whole thing yet			2
i think in two or three years we 'll be able to do that			2
" @entity43 says the commercial 3 - d printer market is now growing exponentially , likening the change to the switch from mainframe computers to desktop during the 1980s			1
you can now buy printers for $ 1,000 going up to around $ 500,000 , he says			0
but you might not need one at all			0
" if you 're interested in , say , making @entity54 covers and you wanted to make them high quality , you could send the file online and it could be shipped overnight to you or your customer			0
so , essentially there is a cloud manufacturing model that is happening that is allowing people to do this , " @entity21 said			2
see more : how you can ' print ' 3 - d objects at home the scale of @entity3 products is also expanding with printing ranging from the micro scale right up to building - size , according to @entity21			1
most people are printing toys at the moment , but industrial applications are also growing			2
engineers at @entity77 ( the @entity77 ) -- parent of plane manufacturer @entity79 -- are at the vanguard of the rapidly advancing field			1
the benefits are enormous , says @entity83 , leader of @entity84 ( @entity84 ) research at @entity77 , based in the @entity86			1
" for us , it 's very advantageous to have a technology where we do n't need specialized tooling			0
when you invest in tooling it drives you to a requirement for higher volumes in order to make the cost case , " @entity83 said			0
@entity77 is working with titanium alloys , high - strength steels and aluminum alloys , turning them from powder into a solid object ( a process called sintering ) using a laser or an electron beam			1
as well as cutting down on waste , the technology also presents the opportunity to make new system parts that are more complex than ones made using conventional machining , @entity83 says			2
hydraulic manifold channels can now be curved instead of straight , he says , while complex small - scale trusses can now be defined with far greater accuracy			2
compared to machining , printing reduces weight by up to 65 % without compromising on strength , the company says			1
" that 's one of the things that has surprised a lot of people			0
we can achieve properties that are equivalent to or , in some cases , better than available materials from plate products , " @entity83 said			0
none of these new @entity3 parts are flying around in @entity79 's current fleet , but @entity83 is confident they will be by the end of the decade , helping make planes lighter and more fuel efficient			1
by 2050 , @entity77 envisages wings , perhaps even whole planes , being built by vast @entity3 machines			1
" it will require a shift in technology and with that comes other constraints and capabilities			0
but multi-meter , high - value parts are realistic in that time frame			0
it 's a very serious focus , " @entity83 said			0
3 - d printing wo n't be a direct replacement for all existing manufacturing technologies , but it will be " a very , very significant introduction of capabilities to complement that , " he says			1
whether @entity21 's robot manages to walk out of a printer in the near term remains to be seen			0
whatever happens , it 's going to be a lot easier to make things , @entity21 says			0
" the bottom line is that for the first time in human history complexity is free -- making something complicated takes the same amount of time , resources and skill of making something simple , " said @entity21			0
" this is a profound departure from the past			0

advances in 3 - d printing could transform manufacturing in the 21st century
manufacturing objects layer by layer is more *precise* and saves waste
@entity181 researcher hopes to print a fully working robot in next few years
*aviation* company @entity77 *hoping* to build wings and possibly whole planes using @entity3 printing by 2050
