in an election - year policy change , the @entity1 administration said friday it will stop deporting young illegal immigrants who entered the @entity4 as children if they meet certain requirements			1
the shift on the politically volatile issue of immigration policy prompted immediate praise from @entity12 leaders who have criticized @entity13 and the @entity14 for inaction , while @entity16 reacted with outrage , saying the move amounts to amnesty -- a negative buzz word among conservatives -- and usurps congressional authority			1
what to know on immigration in the @entity4 those who might benefit from the change expressed joy and relief , with celebratory demonstrations forming outside the @entity14 and elsewhere			2
@entity30 , a student who has campaigned for such a move , said he was " definitely speechless , " then added : " it 's great news			2
" in a @entity34 address friday afternoon , president @entity1 said the changes caused by his executive order will make immigration policy " more fair , more efficient and more just			1
" " this is not amnesty			2
this is not a path to citizenship			0
it 's not a permanent fix , " @entity1 said to take on conservative criticism of the step			1
" this is a temporary stopgap measure			0
" noting children of illegal immigrants " study in our schools , play in our neighborhoods , befriend our kids , pledge allegiance to our flag , " @entity1 said , " it makes no sense to expel talented young people who are , for all intents and purposes , @entity4			1
" when a reporter interrupted @entity1 with a hostile question , the president admonished him and declared that the policy change is " the right thing to do			1
" under the new policy , people younger than 30 who came to the @entity4 before the age of 16 , pose no criminal or security threat , and were successful students or served in the military can get a two - year deferral from deportation , homeland security secretary @entity67 said			1
read the @entity78 memo ( @entity79 ) it also will allow those meeting the requirements to apply for work permits , @entity78 said , adding that participants must be in the @entity4 now and be able to prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years			1
the change is part of a department effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a greater threat , such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now , @entity78 said , adding it was " well within the framework of existing laws			1
" 2009 study : 4 million ' illegal ' immigrant children are native - born citizens the move addresses a major concern of the @entity12 community and mimics some of the provisions of a @entity104 proposal called the @entity105 that has failed to win enough @entity16 support to gain congressional approval			1
@entity1 has been criticized by @entity12 - @entity4 leaders for an overall increase in deportations of illegal aliens in recent years			1
last year , @entity112 removed 396,906 illegal immigrants , the largest number in the agency 's history			0
immigration lessons for the @entity4 from around the world friday 's policy change is expected to potentially affect 800,000 people , an administration official told @entity122 on background			1
both @entity1 and @entity78 called for @entity13 to pass the @entity105 , which would put into law similar steps for children of illegal immigrants to continue living and working in the country			1
" i 've been dealing with immigration enforcement for 20 years and the plain fact of the matter is that the law that we 're working under does n't match the economic needs of the country today and the law enforcement needs of the country today , " @entity78 told @entity122			1
" but as someone who is charged with enforcing the immigration system , we 're setting good , strong , sensible priorities , and again these young people really are not the individuals that the immigration removal process was designed to focus upon			0
" republicans who have blocked @entity104 efforts on immigration reform immediately condemned the move , with some calling it an improper maneuver to skirt congressional opposition			2
rep. @entity148 of @entity149 , a leading @entity16 foe of @entity104 proposals for immigration reform , threatened to file a lawsuit asking the courts to stop @entity1 " from implementing his unconstitutional and unlawful policy			1
" in a @entity160 post , @entity157 sen. @entity157 of @entity158 called the decision " a classic @entity1 move of choosing politics over leadership , " while @entity166 chairman @entity165 , @entity167 , called the change a " decision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants			1
" " many illegal immigrants will falsely claim they came here as children and the federal government has no way to check whether their claims are true , " @entity165 said in a statement			0
" and once these illegal immigrants are granted deferred action , they can then apply for a work permit , which the administration routinely grants 90 % of the time			2
" others complained the move will flood an already poor job market for young @entity4 with illegal immigrants			2
however , @entity104 sen. @entity185 of @entity186 , who sponsored the @entity105 , welcomed the announcement that he said " will give these young immigrants their chance to come out of the shadows and be part of the only country they 've ever called home			0
" immigration shift sparks reaction from both sides he rejected the @entity16 argument that @entity1 's move was all about politics , noting " there will be those who vote against him because of this decision , too			1
that 's what leadership is about			0
" @entity185 also noted that @entity1 repeatedly called for @entity13 to pass immigration reform legislation , including the @entity105			2
now that it is clear no progress would occur this @entity13 , the president acted , @entity185 said			2
@entity1 has used executive orders more frequently in recent months to launch initiatives he advocates that have been stymied by the deep partisan divide in @entity13			2
a @entity14 campaign of such steps involving economic programs was labeled " we ca n't wait			0
" @entity16 sen. @entity220 of @entity221 , who has been working on an alternative version of the @entity105 , criticized @entity1 for taking a piecemeal approach friday			1
he said in a statement that " by once again ignoring the @entity226 and going around @entity13 , this short - term policy will make it harder to find a balanced and responsible long - term one			0
" overheard on @entity122 : decision to defer some deportations symbolic @entity220 is considered a possible running mate for certain @entity16 presidential nominee @entity232 , who rejected the @entity105 in the heat of the @entity16 primary campaign but has since expressed willingness to consider whatever @entity220 proposes			2
later friday , @entity232 told reporters that the issue needs more substantive action than an executive order , which can be replaced by a subsequent president			0
he said he agrees with @entity220 's statement that @entity1 's move makes finding a long - term solution more difficult			1
as president , @entity232 said , he would seek to provide " certainty and clarity for people who come into this country through no fault of their own by virtue of the actions of their parents			0
" @entity12 make up the fastest - growing immigrant population in the country , and the @entity12 vote is considered a crucial bloc for the november presidential election			0
a spokeswoman for a major @entity12 group , the @entity259 , hailed the administration 's move			0
@entity262 , skepticism at immigration policy shift " in light of the congressional inaction on immigration reform , this is the right step for the administration to take at this time , " said @entity259 spokeswoman @entity265			0
immigration lawyers also called the change a major step in the right direction			0
however , one immigration expert warned that the new policy does not guarantee the result sought by participants			0
" i worry that the announcement will be implemented more stingily than the administration would like , " said @entity279 , who teaches immigration law at @entity281			0
meanwhile , some evangelical @entity285 leaders who recently met at the @entity14 to discuss immigration issues also endorsed friday 's move , along with the @entity4 @entity288 and some @entity290 groups			0
photos : putting a face on the immigration debate for @entity294 , who came to the @entity4 illegally from @entity295 at age 14 to find his mother , also an illegal immigrant , the new policy means that " maybe i will be able to work without being afraid that someone may deport me			0
" " there is no fear anymore , " he said .			0

president @entity1 says the new policy is " more fair , more efficient and more just "
@entity16 criticize the change as a political move that grants amnesty
secretary @entity78 says the change is not amnesty or immunity
they must be successful students or have served in the military , with clean records
