one day after @entity4 officials announced a @entity6 physician had tested positive for @entity7 , another person who treated patients in @entity2 developed a fever and was put in isolation at a northern @entity11 hospital			1
the second health care worker , a woman who has n't been identified by name , did not have any @entity7 symptoms upon arrival friday at @entity19 , @entity11 health department spokesman @entity12 said			1
yet things changed in the hours that followed			0
according to @entity12 , " this evening , the health care worker developed a fever and is now in isolation and being evaluated at @entity25 in @entity19			1
" that woman is being tested for @entity7 , according to a government official who is receiving updates about the situation			1
unlike dr. @entity31 , the 33 - year - old now in isolation at @entity33 in nearby @entity34 , this second health care worker is not confirmed to have @entity7			1
in fact , there have been far more examples in recent weeks of suspected @entity7 cases than actual ones in the @entity40			1
for all the scares , only four people -- starting with @entity42 , a @entity43 who died in a @entity46 hospital , followed by two @entity46 health care workers who 'd treated him , lastly @entity31 -- so far have been diagnosed with the deadly virus in the @entity40			1
still , the concerns that @entity7 could spread further remain real			1
and , especially amid criticism over how the @entity46 cases were handled , officials have signaled their intent to take stops to prevent it moving in			0
to this end , the governors of @entity4 and @entity11 announced friday their states were stepping up airport screening for @entity7 beyond federal requirements for travelers from ebola - hit countries in @entity2			1
the policy allows the states to determine hospitalization or quarantine for up to 21 days for travelers from the affected countries			0
a mandatory quarantine is called for those who had " direct contact with an individual infected with the ebola virus , " including medical workers who treated @entity7 patients			1
in addition , people with a travel history to the affected regions but with no direct contact with @entity7 patients will be " actively monitored ... and , if necessary , quarantined			1
" the health care worker being isolated at @entity19 's @entity25 was among those initially quarantined as a result of this policy			1
" this is not the time to take chances , " @entity4 gov. @entity86 -- joined by his @entity11 counterpart , @entity87 -- said of the shift			1
" this adjustment in increasing the screening procedures is necessary ... i think public safety and public health have to be balanced and i think this policy does that			1
" @entity4 officials try to reassure public meanwhile , there continues to intense interest about @entity31 , including where he was , and what risk he might have posed , before getting hospitalized thursday			1
he arrived october 17 at @entity4 's @entity106 's airport , days after leaving @entity107 where he 'd been treating @entity7 patients			1
@entity31 felt fine after touching down , only to begin feeling fatigued tuesday			0
but he was n't symptomatic and did n't have a fever -- of 100.3 - degree between 10 and 11 a.m. , according to @entity34 health commissioner @entity109 -- until thursday , at which time he also had nausea , pain and fatigue			1
up through that time , authorities said , @entity31 limited his public interactions but did not eliminate them			0
in fact , he jogged along the @entity116 , rode the subway , took a cab , went bowling , visited a coffee stand at a @entity121 park and ate at a meatball shop , among other activities			0
but that does n't mean he posed to a risk during that time to anyone , beyond perhaps his fiancee and two friends being quarantined and monitored , though they feel healthy			0
on friday , authorities sought to assure an anxious public that the likelihood of @entity31 spreading the virus while out and about was low			0
@entity109 said the chances of anyone contracting the virus from contact with @entity31 were " close to nil			0
" to show he had no fears , @entity86 vowed to ride the subway on friday			0
" there is no cause for alarm , " mayor @entity139 said			0
" @entity7 is an extremely hard disease to contract			1
there is no reason for @entity34 to change their daily routines in any way			0
" infected doctor talking on phone @entity31 , employed at @entity4 's @entity150 , has been in isolation at @entity33 since emergency personnel took him there thursday morning			1
his @entity121 apartment has been isolated			0

" please support organizations that are sending support or personnel to @entity2 , and help combat one of the worst public health and humanitarian disasters in recent history			2
" in a statement , @entity150 said the doctor was " a dedicated humanitarian " who went to " an area of medical crisis to help a desperately underserved population			0

@entity40 considers ebola quarantine the @entity40 is considering a mandatory quarantine for returning health care workers from @entity2 , an @entity251 administration official said friday			1
the move is an attempt to give clarity to a public concerned about travelers returning from the region and is not because officials fear there is a risk of transmission from people who are not exhibiting @entity7 - like symptoms , the official said			1
@entity7 has killed nearly 5,000 people , mostly in @entity43 , @entity268 and @entity107			2
