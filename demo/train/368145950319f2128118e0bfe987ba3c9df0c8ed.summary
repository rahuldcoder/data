-- blame @entity1 , and especially @entity2 : next week is n't going to feel very much like summer in parts of the @entity5			1
lows in the 40s will bring out the blankets in parts of the @entity10 as temperatures dip 10 to 20 degrees below normal			1
other regions also will be a little cooler , if not as drastically			2
why ? @entity2 , the storm that hit @entity17 this week , made the jet stream wavier than usual , and starting monday , the stream will dip into the @entity10 , allowing cool @entity1 air to drop south , @entity0 meteorologist @entity14 said			1
a sampling : @entity22 , @entity23 , could see a low of 45 on tuesday morning , and it might reach only 58 on monday and 57 on tuesday -- a departure from july averages in the mid- 70s			2
@entity27 , which is used to july highs in the mid- 80s , might get up to 65 on monday , 70 on tuesday and 75 on wednesday			0
@entity29 could see highs of 78 on monday , 67 on tuesday and 72 on wednesday			0
highs in the mid- 80s are average			0
outside the @entity10 , the weather wo n't be particularly cool , but it wo n't be scorching , either : @entity34 will be baking on monday ( 93 ) but might get up to only 81 on wednesday			1
@entity35 could see highs of 81 on tuesday and 78 on wednesday			0
@entity37 , @entity38 , which is used to july highs in the upper 80s , should be in the low 80s wednesday .			0

parts of the @entity10 will see lows in the 40s next week
temperatures to dip 10 to 20 degrees below normal in parts of the @entity5
a *typhoon* *rippled* the jet stream , which will allow cool @entity1 air to drop south
