-- for a century , the bedrock principle of our tax code has been progressivity : the rich pay a larger share of income than the middle class and poor			0
yet @entity10 's revelation that he paid 14 % in federal income taxes on more than $ 40 million in income in 2010 and 2011 reveals an increasingly open secret : @entity14 is dead for the superrich			1
it also suggests that the main argument made by @entity10 and others for this highly unequal state of affairs -- that it 's essential to spur job creation and economic growth -- is false			1
@entity10 is fabulously wealthy because he is a hard worker and a smart businessman , to be sure			2
( being the child of a smart businessman certainly does n't hurt either			0
) yet there 's also no question that @entity10 has benefited enormously from the growing tilt of the tax code toward the nation 's highest earners			1
the code used to impose higher and higher rates all the way up the income ladder			0
today , the very richest generally pay no more than the modestly well - to - do			0
and indeed , many of the superrich are paying lower rates			2
@entity38 has said he pays less in taxes as a share of income than the people who work for him			0
the issue is n't just declining rates at the top			0
just as crucial , politicians have also shifted the code away from taxing income from assets			0
payroll taxes are up ; capital gains taxes , estate taxes , gift taxes , dividend taxes -- all way down			1
since the superrich get much of their income this way , federal taxes on the superrich are way down too			2
from the mid- 1990s to the eve of the recession , according to the @entity65 , the effective federal income tax rate on the richest 400 taxpayers declined from roughly 30 % to around 16 % , a change worth an average of more than $ 45 million a year for every taxpayer in the top 400			1
this is not manna from heaven ; it means higher taxes for everyone else , cuts in valued things that government does , or deficits			0
and while every income group has seen its effective federal taxes go down , the drop has been far steeper at the top , even as the top has pulled dramatically away from the rest of @entity84			1
@entity10 , like much of @entity84 's financial elite , argues that this is just good economics			1
tax capital less , the argument goes , and you encourage innovation and investment			2
the argument sounds reasonable , but the evidence for it is scarce			0
the nonpartisan @entity95 has found no significant economic benefits from the favorable tax treatment of capital gains			1
on the other hand , targeted tax - cutting for the rich has certainly spurred one form of innovation and investment : ever more creative strategies by lawyers and lobbyists to rewire the tax code and reshuffle rich people 's incomes so that their earnings show up as lightly taxed capital gains , not the wages and salaries on which the rest of @entity84 workers rely			1
when @entity10 was at @entity118 , for example , he and his associates would aggressively load companies up with debt and then reap big short - term gains that depended on tax provisions allowing investors to write off interest on company debt			1
even more telling , @entity10 is taxed so lightly in part because of a longstanding bug in the tax code that deep - pocketed lobbyists have managed to preserve			2
unlike most finance professionals , he and other hedge fund and private equity managers get to treat a big part of the fees they earn from managing other people 's money as " carried interest , " subject to the capital gains rate , not the much higher income rate			1
this egregious loophole did n't matter when private equity was rare and capital gains were taxed more or less like other income			2
now , as @entity10 can attest , it matters a lot			0
with carried interest accounting for a quarter of his income over the last two years , @entity10 saved about $ 2.5 million from this tax break alone			2
in short , the tax cuts of the last few decades look less like general economic boosters and more like economic smart bombs delivering payloads of cash to their carefully selected recipients			0
the big winners have not been the highly educated and skilled in general , but financial and nonfinancial executives who make up six in 10 of the top one - tenth of 1 % of earners			0
meanwhile , most small businesses , entrepreneurs and self - employed businesspeople have , like @entity38 's employees , been left out of the tax - cutting spree			0
listening to the apocalyptic rhetoric about small businesses that would be crushed by ending the @entity168 tax cuts for top earners , for example , one would never know that only about 3 % of taxpayers claiming small - business income would be affected by raising the top rate			0
and many of those that would are hedge funds , law firms and rich individuals filing as corporations -- not your typical image of a small business			0
actually , @entity10 's own business career makes the point better			1
no one seems to have noticed it , but @entity10 worked those long hours and made those risky bets mostly during a decade - long period when capital gains were taxed at the same rate as labor income			1
for a brief shining moment , the @entity190 that @entity10 's icon @entity191 supported interrupted the steady decline of capital gains taxes and restored the simple idea that all income should be taxed equally			1
that is to say , @entity10 's own success suggests that low capital gains rates are n't necessary to encourage the kind of entrepreneurship that @entity10 now celebrates			1

@entity210 , @entity211 : @entity10 's returns are a case study of tax policy for superrich
they say the effective tax rate for the wealthiest @entity84 has declined sharply
authors : lower capital gains taxes have no real economic benefit
it 's time for a return to a more progressive *system* of taxation , they say
