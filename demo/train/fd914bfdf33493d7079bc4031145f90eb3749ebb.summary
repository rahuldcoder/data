-- as the @entity2 gears up for possible airstrikes inside @entity4 , it should remember one thing : no matter how much planning has gone into @entity2 military plans to counter the @entity10 in @entity11 and @entity4 , the @entity7 public is n't convinced that anything will change			1
indeed , a look at @entity7 social and online media reveals something quite different : the more blistering the rhetoric from @entity22 , the more the region 's bloggers and @entity20 users burst into laughter			1
this week , diplomats and leaders met in @entity26 to discuss the @entity28 threat , a meeting that came a week after president @entity31 's speech outlining the @entity2 strategy to defeat the group			1
the prevailing view in the @entity7 world seems to be that the president 's address was long on rhetoric and short on ideas for constructive action			1
why this conclusion ? more than three years into @entity4 's civil war , the @entity2 has lost credibility after standing by as @entity4 president @entity44 bombed and killed his own people , including the widely believed use of chemical weapons			1
after drawing a red line , @entity31 stepped back from military action , saying he needed the approval of @entity51			2
he used similar rhetoric in his speech last week			2
in the newspaper @entity54 , @entity55 spoke for many when he wrote : " truth be told , regional states have been calling on the international community -- particularly the @entity2 -- for two years , asking them to cooperate in confronting these dangerous groups			0
unfortunately , the @entity62 has rejected these appeals			0
... ( @entity66 ) he @entity2 president was eventually forced to act following international pressure and after the atrocities committed by ( @entity28 ) became too much to ignore			1
" @entity7 intellectuals recognize that over the last 30 years @entity71 groups have been defeated only after local populations rejected their ideologies and violence			0
they understand that conventional military intervention and drone strikes are unlikely to eradicate @entity28 , and that although @entity28 has made enemies , it also could not have made its dramatic gains without at least tacit support from local populations			2
the @entity2 exacerbated the problem of not winning over locals by upping and leaving before the political task had been completed			0
" @entity28 would not have become such a strong and widespread entity if the @entity2 had n't pulled its troops from @entity11 prior to addressing certain issues : @entity88 regaining their rights and dignity , limiting @entity92 's interference , and completely eradicating @entity93 , " commentator @entity87 wrote			1
he is far from alone in this thinking			0
many @entity88 blame the @entity2 not only for invading @entity11 and creating fertile ground for extremism in the first place , but then making things worse by throwing its support behind the @entity102 - led government of @entity103 , whose sectarian leadership marginalized @entity88			0
remember , the earlier iteration of @entity28 was @entity93 in @entity11 , which was responsible for a considerable share of the sectarian violence that swept the country after the @entity2 invasion			1
" only idiots can not see that @entity28 was created by the @entity2 , " @entity110 argued in the @entity111			1
" it was the only way for it to regain the strength and influence it had lost in the @entity117			0
a closer look at the media indicates that @entity28 is present everywhere , in countries where the @entity2 has vested interests , but not in the @entity2 itself			1
... @entity2 policy was never ethical or humane but it has now reached unprecedented levels of lack of shame			0
" such condemnation has also found its voice through cartoonists and satirists who believe world powers are , quite frankly , impotent in the face of the militant group			0
@entity133 , a @entity134 - based @entity4 commentator , came up with some humorous takes on the warnings emanating from leaders in @entity137 and @entity26 -- " we will hit @entity28 on the nose with a big sausage and laugh loudly , " he mused as an apt quote for @entity140 chancellor @entity139 , and , " we will smack @entity28 on the head and then push them in a puddle of mud , " for @entity148 president @entity147			2
cartoons in the @entity151 media have been just as scathing			0
one of the most popular shows @entity31 reaching his hand out to an injured @entity7 , telling him he wants to cooperate with the @entity154 world			1
but the @entity7 in the cartoon is unable to shake hands because one arm has been severed at the elbow and his other arm is in a sling due to an injury sustained in @entity11			0
the message is clear : the @entity2 has created so much violence in the region that there is no longer anyone still standing with whom it could effectively work			0
true -- officially at least -- some @entity7 governments have been a little more enthusiastic about the @entity2 cause			1
ten @entity7 nations signed up last week to join the fight against @entity28			2
but such vows are likely to meet a weary shrug of the shoulders among much of the public			0
as far as many are concerned , @entity28 is n't go anywhere soon .			2

@entity7 public does n't have faith in @entity2 military strategy for countering @entity28 , *authors* say
view is that president @entity31 's speech on @entity28 was long on rhetoric , short on ideas , they say
bloggers and commentators have been scathing about @entity193 actions , *writers* say
