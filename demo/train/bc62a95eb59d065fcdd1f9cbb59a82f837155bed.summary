-- @entity1 is the traditional tie - breaking primary in the january gantlet -- but there 's very little that 's traditional about the @entity1			1
it is a sprawling cross section of 10 media markets and one of the most diverse states in the nation , containing communities of voters across the political spectrum			0
but we talk about politics in shorthand , and many stereotypes endure long after they are bypassed by reality			0
so here are three stubborn myths about the @entity1 to think about as @entity22 go the polls on tuesday			2
1 ) it 's senior - citizen central : this stereotype started in the post-war boom , as legions of grandparents sought out the warmth of @entity1 to ease their aching bones			1
the state came to be seen as a land of early - bird specials , bad drivers and retirement communities punctuated by amusement parks -- " @entity39 's waiting room			1
" but in the 1980s , young families began to move into @entity1 en masse , following economic opportunity and now - ubiquitous air - conditioning			1
today , just 17 % of @entity1 's population comprises senior citizens -- just above the national average , according to the @entity47			1
moreover , 22 % of @entity22 are under - 18 -- a number boosted by high levels of immigration from @entity51			1
and two @entity1 cities , @entity53 and @entity54 , are among the top 10 youngest cities in @entity51 , with median ages of 24 and 26 respectively			1
@entity1 's diversity is no myth -- but the idea that it is defined or even disproportionately dominated by @entity61 voters does n't hold water			1
2 ) @entity64 - @entity63 are the @entity66 community : this stereotype goes back to the exodus of @entity64 fleeing the tyrannical communist regime of @entity70 in 1960			1
to be sure , a vibrant , passionate and conservative community remains centered in @entity72 and the surrounding area			0
the @entity74 remains a staple on any @entity78 presidential candidate 's trip to @entity72			0
but @entity64 - @entity63 make up only 30 % of the @entity66 population of @entity1			1
southern @entity1 has become the capital of @entity51 , as wealthy families have realized it is the most stable nearby place to put their money and families			1
among the @entity86 - speaking population are large numbers of @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 ( who are not immigrants at all , but fellow @entity63 )			2
simply denouncing @entity70 wo n't be enough to win their votes			0
@entity70 recently weighed in on the @entity78 primary race and proclaimed it " in all seriousness , the greatest competition of idiocy and ignorance that has ever been " -- except for all the show trials , imprisonments and executions of his political rivals , of course			0
interestingly , despite @entity111 's attacks on fellow @entity78 candidates who support comprehensive immigration reform and the @entity114 , polls show that he is doing surprisingly well with the @entity66 vote this time around			2
3 ) there is a typical @entity1 voter : compared with the other states in the january primary ordeal -- @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 -- @entity1 is a complex array of 10 media markets , all with different characteristics			2
the northern part of the state , from the @entity128 to @entity129 , is the @entity130 , a continuum of adjoining @entity132 and @entity133			2
the i - 4 corridor , from the @entity135 to @entity136 to @entity137 / @entity138 , is largely made up of young families -- some native to @entity1 , but many others @entity142 transplants looking for a new start			1
the tony southeast coast of @entity146 is a wealthy enclave with many snowbirds from the @entity149			0
@entity72 and the southern tip make up the capital of @entity51			2
and @entity152 is the @entity153			2
all of which means it is expensive to run statewide in @entity1 -- and the messaging is complex			0
it must appeal to more of a series of nation - states than a state with a homogenized character			0
it is , to that extent , the best test of a candidate 's ability to connect in a national campaign to date in the primary calendar			0
it is a red state , a blue state and a swing state -- all rolled into one			0
join the conversation on @entity175			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			0

@entity178 : @entity1 is not one - *dimensional* ; it contains left , right and center voters
@entity178 : it 's not " @entity39 's waiting room " ; only 17 % of residents are seniors , 22 % are under 18
@entity188 , usually conservative , are only 30 % of the @entity66 population , he says
@entity178 : @entity1 has aspects of @entity51 , @entity153 , @entity130 , young , old , rich , poor
