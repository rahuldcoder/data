@entity0 , @entity1 -- world champion @entity3 has told @entity2 that he has a difficult relationship with his former teammate , motorcycling legend @entity7			1
the @entity8 usurped the seven - time @entity10 titleholder last season , setting records for most wins and points scored as @entity7 struggled to recover after a series of injuries			1
the 23 - year - old @entity3 accused @entity7 , now 32 , of dangerous riding in @entity18 last october before clinching his maiden crown in @entity20 in the following race			1
the @entity22 subsequently ended his seven - year stint at @entity24 , where he and @entity25 had been awkward stablemates since 2008 , and joined @entity27			1
" i think it was a problem of character , " @entity3 told @entity29 's @entity28 in an exclusive interview in @entity0			1
" we had a very tough character , really strong			2
we just did n't ... have a feeling			0
" look , i do n't have any personal problems with the riders i 'm competing with			0
i believe you can be friends with a rider while you are fighting for the championship			0
i do n't have any friends , but i believe in it ! " despite their problems , @entity3 said he did not expect @entity7 to join @entity27 , replacing @entity45 -- who moved to the @entity22 's first team @entity47			1
ducati have been off the pace since @entity45 won his and the team 's first and only world title in 2007			1
" i was a bit surprised , because it 's a big challenge for him , but i also would think if i was in his position , it could be a really interesting challenge , no ? " @entity3 said			1
" because @entity27 being an @entity22 brand ... it 's really difficult , but for them it 's a nice idea			1
" the @entity62 became only the second @entity8 to win the world title in motorcycling 's elite class , but admits he was a little underwhelmed at the time			1
" this happens always in life			0
when you like a girl , you have obsession for the girl , you want to be with this girl and when you finally are with this girl , you think ' that is it ? not anything more ? ' " with the world title , it 's the same			2
you imagine , you dream a lot about this ; when it happens , then you think , ' it 's only this ? ' but then , after a few hours , when you are more calm , when you are alone , with your friends , with the people who are more close to you , then you start to realize how important the thing you got is			2
" @entity45 strikes first blow of 2011 @entity10 season @entity3 was named @entity1 's sportsman of the year and later met @entity90 , but is still coming to terms with his newfound celebrity status			1
" when i was n't famous , i wanted to achieve that because it 's cool , no ? but when it happens , every time you go to a restaurant you have to stop your meal to take a picture			2
when you are going to a discotheque it 's impossible to dance , it 's impossible to be with your friends because every meter you walk you have to take a picture ! " @entity3 goes into this weekend 's @entity103 having finished second behind @entity45 at the season - opening race in @entity105 , but said he feels no pressure to emulate last year 's achievements			1
" i really do n't think about this			0
i have this new adhesive on the front of the bike -- this number one			0
i 'm proud of it but i do n't think i am number one forever or that i ca n't lose , " he said			0
" i do n't have more points than anyone else in the category from the beginning and i guess i can lose the championship			0
the other riders can beat me if i do n't work hard or if i have an inferior bike			0
" @entity3 started riding at the age of three when his father , himself a former racer , built him his first bike			2
" i have always had this necessity to win			0
when i played with my friends on the street , football or running , i always wanted to be the best , " he said			0
" i competed in everything in @entity62 , all the championships , and i won a lot			0
you dream about getting into the world championship someday , to be professional , but it 's a very long way and you do n't know if this is going to happen or not			2
