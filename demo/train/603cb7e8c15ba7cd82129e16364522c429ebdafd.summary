@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 rescuers pulled a 22 - year - old man from the ruins of a three - story building on friday , 10 days after the massive earthquake killed tens of thousands of people			1
the man , who was not immediately identified , was rescued near the quake - ravaged presidential residence south of the capital , according to the @entity14			1
maj. @entity15 said @entity17 and @entity18 doctors asked for the @entity4 team 's assistance after trying to rescue the trapped man themselves			1
the rescuers " were able to release him whole and healthy " and take him to an @entity14 field hospital in stable condition for further treatment , " he said			0
rescuers continue efforts to find survivors who have defied the odds , including a 7 - year - old boy and 11 - year - old girl who were found tuesday			1
another 5 - year - old boy , @entity34 , was pulled alive from rubble nearly eight days after the 7.0 - magnitude quake had leveled much of @entity0			1
more than 121 people have been pulled alive from the rubble , the @entity37 said this week			0
fires are expected to flare up in the quake 's aftermath , from broken mains and other damage			1
a massive blaze consumed a textile factory in @entity0 friday night as @entity37 workers tried to contain the flames and spare nearby buildings			1
the cause of the fire was not immediately known			0
meanwhile , aftershocks from the 7.0 - magnitude quake have become a way of life for people here as they spend their days searching for food , water and shelter			1
@entity1 brace for each aftershock as they wait for supplies and sustenance to reach them			1
more than $ 355 million in donations in the @entity17 alone has been raised for the relief effort , but stacks of aid -- baby formula , pain medication , antibiotics and other much - needed supplies -- are sitting on the tarmac and in warehouses at the airport in @entity0 , the capital			1
what is reaching the hands of survivors is getting there at a snail 's pace			0
" it 's a shame , because you would hope that everything could get out there within seconds , " @entity81 col. @entity80 told @entity2 's chief medical correspondent , @entity82 , at the airport			1
" but that kind of infrastructure just is n't in place			0
" full coverage @entity94 updates each new aftershock -- smaller earthquakes that follow a more powerful one -- slows down the relief effort even further			2
friday morning 's 4.4 - magnitude quake was much less powerful than the 7.0 - magnitude one that struck january 12 , leaving widespread death and destruction in its wake			1
a 5.9 - magnitude earthquake wednesday was the strongest aftershock of the week -- enough to cause considerable damage , the @entity107 said , though the extent of damage that any earthquake causes depends on factors such as its depth , its proximity to dense population centers and the strength of structures where it hits			1
an @entity17 adoption service provider in @entity1 wrote in a blog that the aftershock wednesday sent " a wall tumbling down on our heads			1
" @entity123 said its staff " heard already - weakened structures collapsing " as a result			2
still , the 7.0 - magnitude quake was more than 40 times stronger than the 5.9 - magnitude aftershock , researchers said			1
the death toll is estimated at 200,000 , according to the @entity131 , whose commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , @entity132 , got a firsthand view of the situation in @entity0 this week			1
about 250,000 people are in urgent need of aid and another 3 million have been affected , the @entity131 reported			0
despite all the obstacles , some progress was made friday			2
the city 's south pier was operating , though slowly			2
authorities pushed friday to get operations moving faster at the port			2
the north pier remained unusable , and the south pier is the smaller of the two			2
in addition to the aftershocks , bottlenecks at all points of entry -- the airport , roads and ports -- have delayed food and medical aid to the estimated 3 million @entity1 affected by the quake			1
@entity162 troops have been working to open an airport in @entity164 , a seaside town about 8 miles from @entity0			1
about 120 to 140 flights a day were coming into the single - runway @entity0 airport , compared with 25 a day just after the quake struck last week			1
but there was still a long list of flights waiting to come in , lt. gen. @entity169 of the @entity170 said thursday			2
@entity174 : list of missing , found are you there ? to improve air traffic , the @entity17 military said wednesday it had obtained landing rights at the @entity183 's air base at @entity184 , about 220 kilometers ( 135 miles ) east of @entity0			1
@entity183 troops will start patrolling a critical corridor between @entity187 and @entity0 , the @entity37 said			1
the patrol should speed the delivery aid into @entity1 , it said			0
in the meantime , working under adverse conditions with limited supplies , medical teams have been forced to improvise			2
@entity194 , field coordinator for @entity195 , said this week staffers had to buy a saw in the market so surgeons could do amputations			0
a @entity2 crew loaned a medic a pocketknife for another operation			0
lacking rubbing alcohol , doctors have used vodka to sterilize equipment and instruments			0
surgical patients are receiving over-the - counter pain medicine because doctors lack stronger medication			2
one nurse used a string of @entity217 lights as a makeshift extension cord			0
the @entity219 , a @entity17 naval hospital off the coast , received about 240 patients over 36 hours , said capt. @entity222 , the commanding officer			0
" most of those individuals are critical care types of injuries , " he told @entity2 's " @entity226			0
" virtually all are being brought to the ship by air			0
the ship has 80 doctors , including 24 surgeons , and 140 nurses , he said			0
" i think when we 're totally mature , which will be in the next two to three days , we believe that we 'll be able to push about 150 patients through to the ship and off the ship every day for surgical care , and the government of @entity1 is giving us guidance exactly on where those patients will receive their follow - on care , " he said , adding that officials hope the international community and the @entity37 will oversee that process			2
more than 300 aid distribution sites are up and running , a senior @entity17 administration official said			2
more than 700,000 meals and 1.4 million bottles of water have been delivered , along with 22,000 pounds of medical supplies , @entity169 said			0
impact your world @entity256 's 250 - feet long , 80 - feet wide @entity255 -- loaded five pallets high with food and water , medical supplies , generators and sundries -- set sail friday afternoon			1
@entity256 authorities say that when it arrives in @entity1 on monday morning , it will be the single largest shipment of aid to arrive there to date			0
the roughly 4 million pounds of food are enough to feed the people of @entity0 for a week			1
organizers say it would take 150 planes to carry as much cargo			0
a group of rescuers told @entity2 friday that each rescue gives them hope to keep working			0
" every time we find a live victim that 's the energy that keeps us going to the next day , " said capt. @entity276 of @entity277			0
" these are some of the harshest conditions i 've ever seen , " he said , adding , " nothing has ever prepared us for what we 've seen here this week			0
" at least 9,288 @entity17 and some of their family members in @entity1 have been evacuated , according to the @entity287 , though the whereabouts of nearly 5,000 other @entity17 remain unknown			0
some 75 others from the @entity17 -- including five government officials -- are either confirmed or presumed dead			0
@entity2 's @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 contributed to this report .			0
