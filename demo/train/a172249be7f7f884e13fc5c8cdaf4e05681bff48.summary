-- a return to democracy hung in the balance in impoverished @entity4 on wednesday as supporters of the @entity8 nation 's military coup leader clamored for him to head the interim government			1
capt. @entity11 's supporters called for the resignation of @entity13 , who was beaten and rushed to a hospital with head injuries after hundreds of protesters stormed the presidential palace monday			1
@entity13 , 70 , left @entity4 on wednesday for medical treatment in @entity19 , said a presidential aide who did not want to be named for security reasons			1
@entity22 , the capital , was calm but tense wednesday evening amid a strong police and military presence			1
" the people want @entity29 to come back for the transition of power , " said @entity26 , a spokesman for one of the groups backing @entity29			1
@entity13 's term as interim president had been set to expire tuesday			1
however , the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) , which has tried to broker a return to civilian rule after the march 22 coup , decided to let @entity13 remain in charge for a year to oversee a transition back to democracy			1
that deal included recognizing @entity43 as former head of state , with a salary and mansion			2
over the weekend , @entity29 agreed to abide by the decision			2
but his supporters stood defiantly against the regional bloc			1
@entity4 experienced two decades of democratic rule and was hailed as an example of @entity8 stability			2
but it plunged into chaos after the coup that ousted president @entity57 from power			1
@entity11 and his fellow officers complained that @entity57 had failed to properly equip soldiers battling a growing insurgency by separatist @entity63 rebels in the country 's north			1
@entity63 rebels capitalized on the trouble in @entity22 in the south and took over chunks of territory in the north			2
islamists now control two - thirds of the country , and many fear they will benefit further from delays in transitioning back to civilian rule			0
protesters said @entity13 , a former parliamentary speaker , was part of a self - serving political elite that has misruled the country for years			1
" people have no faith in the politicians to organize elections and resolve the situation in the north , " said @entity81 , the leader of several groups demanding the president 's resignation			1
" that 's why they want @entity29 to return to power in the role of president , " @entity81 said			1
@entity96 , a senior fellow at the @entity97 , said the perceived elite includes @entity100 speakers , " movers and shakers " and those with access to government contracts and the economy			0
" those elites and the institutions through which they work is not seen as very relevant by the mass of people in @entity22 , " @entity96 said			1
" you are talking about poor , marginalized people as seeing the military as grounds for hope			1
" the @entity8 policy expert said the @entity118 will continue to support pressure by @entity35 on the military junta			1
that could come in the form of financial sanctions , as was the case in 2011 against former @entity126 president @entity125			1
@entity4 , which does not have a robust economy or array of natural resources , could especially feel the pinch			0
" it 's intrinsically one of the poorest countries in the world , " said @entity96			2
" the country is going into a major food security issue because of the ongoing drought			0
" in the north , @entity139 rebels destroyed a monument to those who died in the struggle against dictator @entity144 in 1991			0
" this is very serious , " said @entity145 , mayor of the fabled city of @entity147 , now under the control of @entity149 , a militant group that seeks to impose strict @entity150 , or @entity152 law			0
witness @entity154 said the rebels attacked the monument tuesday evening , shouting : " shame on all those who do n't believe in @entity158			0
" earlier this month , @entity152 burned a tomb listed as a @entity160			0
a vast country of few inhabitants ( 15 million ) and searing desert , @entity4 lies at an awkward intersection in @entity165			0
to the north is a 1,200 kilometer border with @entity168 , to the east @entity169 with its own restive @entity63 minority , to the west @entity172			0
@entity173 , a geopolitical analyst based in @entity175 , said the @entity63 rebellion is a direct result of the @entity179 war			0
well - armed @entity63 separatists who sought refuge in @entity179 and fought for @entity183 's regime returned to @entity4 after he was overthrown and killed			2
" his legacy is alive and well in the secession and @entity150 ( law ) movement in @entity4 , " said @entity173			0
the analyst said @entity29 's objectives are not clear : " is he trying to buy time for himself to stay in power for some time ? " like @entity96 , @entity173 questioned how a group of protesters were able to invade the palace and severely beat @entity13			1
" was that allowed to happen ? " @entity173 asked			0
" was the presidential security that weak ? " problems in the capital appear to be having little impact on three northern regions under rebel control , said @entity96			0
an area the size of @entity205 is now beyond the government 's control			2
" while all of this chaos is going on in @entity22 , nothing is being done to send troops back to retake the north , " said @entity173			0
leaders of @entity149 and the secular @entity214 , or @entity214 , even with their divergent agendas , may be coming to an accord on ruling the north , according to @entity173 , adding @entity149 may be connected to @entity217			0
the nightmare scenario for @entity220 governments is that without the rapid re-establishment of civilian rule , parts of northern @entity4 , southern @entity168 and @entity172 could become a safe haven for @entity217 in the same way the group has exploited power vacuums in @entity228 and @entity229			0
@entity4 , with all of its competing interests , is not seeing a power vacuum , @entity173 said			0
" i would call it a power jumble			2
" @entity235 reported from @entity22 , @entity4			0
@entity0 's @entity236 reported from @entity237			2
