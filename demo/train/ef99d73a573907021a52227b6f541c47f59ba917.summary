@entity0 , @entity1 -- change a few circumstances in her life and @entity6 says she would have been a housewife			1
she was raised to be a good @entity8 wife and homemaker , after all			1
that 's what was expected of women of her generation -- to sit behind their men , make their bentos , iron their shirts and watch them rise to lead @entity1 's economy			1
life did not go as @entity20 expected			0
60 - year - old @entity20 is one of @entity1 's most powerful executives , sitting on the board of both @entity24 and @entity8 - based multi-national companies			1
the fact that she is a female in one of the most male - dominated business cultures is a stunning backstory in one woman 's remarkable ascent through the so - called " bamboo ceiling			1
" bamboo bends , and unlike glass , never breaks			0
but @entity20 managed to crack through , by working for a @entity24 company			0
" i was lucky to be in a place where the hard work was appreciated , " said @entity20 , of her corporate beginnings at @entity39			0
the @entity24 company saw her sales output , the highest in the @entity46 , as the reason for promotion			0
an @entity24 mentor and her supportive husband urged @entity20 to push beyond her @entity8 cultural expectations			1
" if i was to work for a @entity8 company , a large @entity8 company , i do n't think i would have come this far			1
" the @entity54 's @entity53 ranks @entity1 101 out of 134 countries			1
part of the reason for the low ranking is that just 1.4 percent of @entity8 executives are women			1
what that has meant for women in the workplace is they are pushed to traditionally female roles : secretary and store clerk			1
it is a dismal reality for the world 's second - largest economy , said @entity71 , @entity73 's global vice chairwoman and a @entity75 100 most powerful woman			2
" @entity1 is a very homogeneous society			1
so on the spectrum of diversity , not just gender ; it is more difficult to embrace diversity because it 's not a terribly diverse culture to begin with			0
" ironically , @entity71 believes the global economic slowdown and @entity1 's aging population is a chance to rediscover the people under - utilized in the workforce			2
" i think we have an opportunity to change the conversation here			2
whether you 're a country or a company , you need growth			0
@entity1 has an enormous opportunity , frankly , to see the opportunity to spark innovation through a gender lens of diversity			2
i think gender diversity is a big part of the solution			0
" @entity20 agreed , as she celebrates her recent appointment to the @entity103 board			0
she is the first female to be elected to the @entity8 company 's boardroom			1
" experimenting is the best way to say it , " said @entity20 , describing @entity1 's corporate sentiment toward women			1
" they know they have to have diversity but they do n't know how to do it and how to use it effectively			0
as a result of increasing competition outside of @entity1 from @entity119 and @entity120 , the @entity8 business community has realized it has to change			1
they ca n't rely on the past successful model of the 1970s and ' 80s			0
they will have to increase diversity , change the way of doing business in order to compete			0
" @entity20 's new colleague , @entity129 ceo and president @entity130 , said he is encouraged that his company in @entity1 is catching up to other global companies			2
he calls having a female on the board a no - brainer			2
his advice to @entity8 companies : " just branch out and do it			2
they 'll be stronger for it			0
i think they 'll be better companies for it			0

1.4 percent of @entity8 executives are women
women in @entity1 are pushed to traditionally female roles
leading *businesswoman* thinks @entity1 may be ready for a change
first woman on board : @entity1 wants to change ; does n't know how
