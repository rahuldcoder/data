-- at the age of 5 , @entity2 driver @entity1 knew something was n't quite right with his cousin			1
" i remember going to his house and i never understood why he had to take so much medicine every single day			0
i just did n't understand it and really until i got a little bit older did i realize that he had a disease that there was no cure for , " @entity1 says			1
@entity1 's cousin @entity16 has cystic fibrosis , a chronic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system			1
according to the @entity23 , those affected by the disease have a defective gene that causes the body to produce abnormally thick mucus , which can cause the lungs to clog and lead to life - threatening lung infections			1
it can also block the pancreas and make it difficult for the body to break down food			0
the cousins grew up together and watching @entity16 battle the disease profoundly affected @entity1			1
" he 's ( @entity16 ) had a couple lung transplants that have been successful , which is really good and he leads a very normal life			0
but for me it touched me , knowing that one of my family members had to go through that struggle every single day , " says @entity1			2
his cousin is never far from his mind , even when he climbs into his race car every week to compete in @entity2 's elite series			1
" we 've always run a slogan on the back of our race car ever since i was 16 -- " so close yet so far , " which is the slogan of the @entity51 ( foundation ) , because they are so close to having a cure			2
" the effects of watching @entity16 ' struggle ultimately led @entity1 to establish the @entity1 in 2008			2
the foundation 's primary goals are to raise awareness and funds for children dealing with cystic fibrosis			1
in the foundation 's short existence , it has raised more than a million dollars for the cause			2
the @entity1 foundation contributes to the @entity23 as well as to several children 's hospitals that treat kids with this disease			1
one such hospital is the @entity73 of @entity74 at @entity75 in @entity1 's hometown			2
he has donated to the hospital 's clinic and research lab. " the research center at @entity75 has really done a great job of welcoming us in and we 've contributed a lot of money to them because they do a lot of the research for cystic fibrosis			1
they 've shown significant gains as far as trying to find a cure for it in just the last few years and i 'd like to think we had something to do with that , " @entity1 says			1
the connection between @entity1 and the people at @entity75 is obvious			0
he relates to the young patients he visits with , but the staff as well			0
banners bearing his picture hang throughout the clinic , as well as messages wishing him good luck in his attempt to win a @entity2 championship			0
in the restricted area of the research lab , appreciation and understanding of the gift he has given is deeply felt			0
there is a tiny cardboard cutout of @entity1 in his race suit on top of a refrigerator that contains cells			0
staff members joke that they call him the @entity118			0
@entity1 's quiet determination is clear on his face			2
he is dedicated to fighting for his cousin and all who suffer the same turbulent life			0
according to the @entity23 , the current median age of survival is late 30s			0
this is not enough for @entity1			0
he says he will continue to raise money through events like his @entity129 and a celebrity golf tournament			1
he will march on in his fight until , as he says , @entity51 no longer stands for cystic fibrosis , but " eventually we hope @entity51 means cure found			1
