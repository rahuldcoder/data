-- there is a major disconnect between what the @entity4 administration says and what it does about bailing out countries in the @entity9 periphery			2
for while the administration keeps insisting that @entity9 has the financial wherewithal to rescue those @entity9 countries in distress , it has allowed the @entity14 to bail out @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 on an unprecedented scale			1
and it has done so in a manner that puts the @entity22 taxpayer on the hook in a major way			2
and if that were not bad enough , the administration now appears to be acquiescing to substantially bolstering the @entity14 's available resources with large - scale bilateral @entity9 loans			0
it is doing so for potential massive @entity14 lending to @entity29 and @entity30 that would dwarf anything that the @entity14 has previously done and that would put @entity22 taxpayers seriously at risk			1
over the past 18 months , the @entity14 has lent to the @entity9 periphery on a scale that has no precedent in its 67 - year history			0
whereas even during the @entity38 and @entity39 crises of the late 1990s the @entity14 never lent a country more than 12 times its @entity14 quota contribution , its recent loan commitments to @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 have been more of the order of 35 to 40 times those countries ' @entity14 quotas			1
in @entity22 dollar terms , the @entity14 's lending commitments made to those three @entity9 countries now total around $ 100 billion			2
considering that the @entity22 has a 17ยพ % share in the @entity14 , these lending commitments put the @entity22 taxpayer at risk for almost $ 20 billion should those countries be unable to repay the @entity14			1
and the @entity14 is making these massive commitments despite the fact that @entity9 has the money to bail out its own periphery and that @entity9 contributed nothing to help the @entity22 resolve its housing and banking sector crisis in 2008 - 2009			0
the @entity4 administration downplays the potential risk posed to the @entity22 taxpayer by arguing that the @entity14 has preferred creditor status and that to date , it has never had a significant country defaulting on its @entity14 loan obligations			1
what the administration does not say is that the @entity14 's past loan repayment experience is not particularly relevant to its current @entity9 lending programs , since its @entity9 lending is so much larger than any previous @entity14 country loan operation			0
the administration is also not leveling with the @entity22 public as to how ineffectual the very large @entity14 financial support programs have been to date in resolving @entity9 's troubled periphery 's economic problems			2
for while these programs have certainly succeeded in kicking the can down the road , they have done nothing to restore solvency in @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			2
indeed , the @entity14 's recipe of hair - shirt fiscal adjustment within a euro straitjacket that precludes the use of currency devaluation to promote exports as an offset to fiscal austerity has resulted in the deepest of economic recessions in those countries			0
and those recessions have further compromised the periphery 's public finances and increased their public debt burdens			0
in assessing how serious the risk of @entity14 lending is to @entity22 taxpayers , it is of note that the @entity14 's loan commitments to @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 amount to as much as 10 % of those countries ' gross domestic products			1
perhaps more telling is the fact that those loan commitments amount to between one - quarter and one - third of those countries ' annual tax revenue collections			0
the risk to the @entity22 taxpayer is all the greater when one considers that the chance of an unraveling of the euro is now a distinct possibility			2
were that unraveling to occur in a disorderly manner , it would have a devastating impact on the @entity9 periphery 's economic outlook and its public finances			0
considering the very size of the @entity14 loans in relation to those countries ' tax bases , there would be a material chance that those countries would have difficulty repaying the @entity14			0
even more disturbing for @entity22 taxpayers is the size of prospective @entity14 lending to @entity29 and @entity30 , ostensibly to be financed by @entity9 bilateral lending to the @entity14			1
at the recent @entity133 @entity9 summit , the @entity131 countries agreed that they would make bilateral loans to the @entity14 of the order of $ 260 billion			0
those proposed loans were intended to augment the @entity14 's $ 390 billion in overall available resources for potential lending to @entity29 and @entity30			1
judging by the @entity14 's @entity9 bailout programs to date , if @entity29 and @entity30 did have to go to the @entity14 for large - scale financial support , the exposure of @entity22 taxpayers to those two countries could be very large			1
indeed , @entity14 lending commitments to @entity29 and @entity30 could be of the order of $ 750 billion and $ 450 billion , respectively			1
given the @entity22 's 17ยพ % share in the @entity14 , the @entity22 taxpayers ' exposure to @entity29 and @entity30 as a result of @entity14 lending could be on the order of $ 220 billion			1
considering the size of the exposure that might arise from @entity14 lending to the @entity9 periphery , the administration owes it to the @entity22 public to be up front about the potential cost to the @entity22 taxpayer of such lending			1
at the very least , the administration should call the @entity9 on their attempt to bail out the @entity9 periphery by using , in significant part , @entity22 taxpayer money			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			0

@entity161 : @entity14 bailout of @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 puts the @entity22 taxpayer at risk
potential massive @entity14 lending to @entity29 and @entity30 would be even more risky , @entity161 says
@entity22 taxpayers ' exposure to @entity29 and @entity30 could be on the order of $ 220 billion , he says
@entity161 : @entity4 administration owes it to the @entity22 public to be up front about the potential cost
