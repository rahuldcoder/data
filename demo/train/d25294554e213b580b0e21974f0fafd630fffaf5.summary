government surveillance of telephone records and conversations in the name of national security has long been controversial			0
the debate , which dates back decades , is back in the news with recent revelations that the @entity9 government is collecting telephone records in the @entity9 and some internet traffic overseas			1
here 's a primer on what the government is getting , how it affects you and what the legal debate is all about : i live in the @entity9			1
what kinds of records is the government collecting on me ? @entity9 officials have acknowledged collecting domestic telephone records containing the time and date of calls and telephone numbers involved			1
a secret court order published by @entity29 newspaper also indicates the government is getting rough location information and details that would identify the specific handsets used to make mobile calls			1
that court order names @entity36 , but analysts say similar orders are likely in effect for all @entity9 carriers , meaning the government has logs of most , if not all , telephone calls			1
the @entity47 , citing people familiar with @entity46 activities , reported friday that the agency has also collected credit card records			1
but the newspaper could n't say if that collection effort is continuing or was a one - time effort			2
what might the @entity9 have ? if you 're a @entity9 citizen or permanent resident living or traveling overseas , the government says it 's not collecting anything on you , if it does , the government says , it 's incidental and the resulting data is kept under strict controls			1
but the picture could be different for citizens of other nations living outside the @entity9			1
director of national intelligence @entity66 on thursday indirectly confirmed a program to collect data generated by overseas customers of some of the largest internet services companies in the world , including @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			2
@entity66 's statement came thursday in response to stories in the @entity81 and @entity29 newspaper thursday reporting the existence of a program called @entity85			2
the program is designed to collect " audio and video chats , photographs , e-mails , documents " and other materials , @entity86 reported			0
the @entity47 , however , said the monitoring does n't include the contents of messages			0
opinion : @entity46 's phone snooping a different kind of creepy is the government listening to my phone calls ? @entity66 says it 's not			2
what happens to the records ? the telephone records go into a database , where they ca n't be accessed unless a judge gives the go - ahead in a national - security investigation , @entity66 said			0
sen. @entity112 , chairwoman of the @entity113 , said thursday that the records ca n't be accessed without " reasonable and articulable suspicion " that they 're relevant to terrorist activity			0
it 's less clear what happens to the internet monitoring data , but @entity66 said it 's " used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats			1
" why does the government need this information ? access to such information " allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities , particularly people located inside the @entity9 , " a senior @entity129 administration official said thursday			1
@entity66 said thursday that the telephone records allow analysts to " make connections related to terrorist activities over time			0
" the internet data collected overseas " is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect , and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats , " he said			1
who approved these programs ? both programs have been approved by all three branches of government , officials say			1
the telephone records collection program was authorized by the @entity155 under what @entity66 called " stringent condition			0
" it 's reviewed every 90 days , he said			2
@entity112 said the order published in @entity29 was the approval of one such 90 - day review			0
the court is special judicial office set up as part of the 1978 @entity165			0
the court operates in secrecy , reviewing requests by intelligence agencies to conduct electronic surveillance and other activities as part of espionage , terrorism and national security investigations			0
is it legal ? the @entity177 , @entity66 and other administration officials obviously think so			2
but many privacy advocates and some lawmakers believe this sort of broad data collection goes too far			1
" while i can not corroborate the details of this particular report , this sort of widescale surveillance should concern all of us and is the kind of government overreach i 've said @entity9 would find shocking , " said sen. @entity183 , @entity184 , who serves on the @entity113			2
in a letter last year to attorney general @entity195 , @entity183 and sen. @entity196 , @entity197 , complained about secret interpretations of the @entity199 , details of which are classified but which the senators said " most @entity9 would be stunned to learn the details of			1
" " as we see it , there is now a significant gap between what most @entity9 think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows , " the senators wrote			2
" this is a problem , because it is impossible to have an informed public debate about what the law should say when the public does n't know what its government thinks the law says			0
" has this happened before ? in 2006 , it was revealed that the @entity46 was secretly collecting telephone records as part of an effort to root out potential terror plots			1
at that time , @entity36 denied reports that it was providing the @entity46 with data from customers ' domestic calls			0
the company said that while it is committed to helping the government protect against terrorist attacks , " we will always make sure that any assistance is authorized by law and that our customers ' privacy is safeguarded			0
" the @entity239 is also suing the @entity46 over claims that it was working with @entity241 and possibly other telecommunications companies to suck up enormous amounts of internet traffic through secure @entity46 - controlled rooms attached to network stations			0
other programs , some going back decades , have stoked similar concerns			0
in fact , abuses by intelligence services led to the passage of the @entity165 in an effort to rein in domestic surveillance practices .			0
