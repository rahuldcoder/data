-- what do you see when you come across a big tire dump ? one company pulverizes old tires into fine grains to use in other products			1
an eyesore ? a nursery for mosquitoes ? potential for a headline - grabbing , months - long tire fire ? @entity12 sees " the nation 's newest raw material			0
" @entity12 is founder of @entity15 , a @entity16 , @entity17 , company that pulverizes rubber from used tires and factory scrap into powder as fine as talc			1
the powder can be used in manufacturing products that would benefit from the durability of rubber , such as longer - lasting paint , uv - resistant plastics and more elastic sealants			1
" what makes a tire so difficult to dispose of -- it does n't want to break down , it lasts forever ... it 's the same type of attributes we can bring to new products , " @entity12 says			1
the @entity36 @entity35 reports that about a quarter of scrap tires are left in landfills each year			1
the rest are used as fuel , retreaded or recycled for other projects			0
the powder from @entity12 's business also can be used in manufacturing new tires			1
@entity47 technologies chief financial officer @entity46 says that the rising prices for oil - based synthetic rubber and natural rubber are an incentive for companies to re-use rubber			0
several years ago , while working in the business of recycling newspapers , bottles and cans , @entity12 was asked to find a use for unwanted tires			1
@entity12 says he talked with potential customers of recycled rubber to determine what they would need			0
ultrafine particles , in large volume , was the answer			2
so he ended up in @entity67 at a company that did precision - grinding of pharmaceuticals for time - release capsules			2
" i walked in with my bag of rubber and they threw me out , " @entity12 recalls			0
but they invited him back , ran the rubber through their process , and produced the powder @entity12 was looking for			2
@entity12 bought the company , and in 2006 put that process to work at a plant in suburban @entity82			1
the process works like this : @entity47 brings in scrap rubber from tire manufacturers and rubber chips from tire recyclers who have already removed the steel and fiber			2
the rubber is sliced and diced , then frozen with liquid nitrogen to make it extremely brittle			0
then it 's shaken , crushed , cut and ground to various fine sizes for various needs			2
several companies are testing out the powder in their products			1
" we have a variety of customers , everyone from customers who manufacture tires , to customers who manufacture automotive parts like wheel wells , or bumpers , or paints and coatings , companies that are making rubberized flat bed inner liners , to companies that are using it for paints for home use , or backing to carpet underlayment , " @entity12 says			0
the plant can grind out up to 100 million pounds of powder per year			1
the company is planning to build an additional facility in 2008			0
pulverizing rubber is not new , says @entity125 , senior technical director for the @entity126 , a trade group			0
but @entity47 is grinding the powder finer than other companies			0
" @entity47 could have an impact if they are successful because they will open up new opportunities that up to now have not been available , " @entity125 says .			0
