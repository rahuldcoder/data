@entity0 when @entity3 senators arrived for their policy lunch this week , several came off the elevators in the @entity7 and turned instinctively towards the @entity8 , a large and elegant meeting space just off the @entity11 floor			1
it was only after walking in on a roomful of lunching @entity15 senators that the @entity18 , to their chagrin , realized that when they lost the majority , they also lost many of the perks of power -- including use of the spacious room that 's hosted @entity3 caucuses for the last eight years			1
" i 'm going to the wrong caucus , " sen. @entity26 , @entity27 , said with an embarrassed smile as he turned to find the @entity29 , an equally ornate but tighter room where the smaller 46 - member @entity3 caucus will now meet			2
" oh , i forgot we were in this room , " grumbled sen. @entity34 , a @entity36 @entity35 , as he walked into @entity29			0
the room assignment is just one example of how life will be different for @entity18 after a long eight years in the majority -- so long , in fact , that most current @entity3 senators have never served in the minority			1
gone are coveted committee chairmanships and the enormous influence over legislation , oversight hearings and investigations that go with them			0
gone too are committee slots for @entity18 , as @entity15 beef up @entity15 control of the committees that will vote to cuts taxes , slash spending , ditch government regulations , and approve other measures that many @entity18 oppose			1
the long weekends @entity18 regularly scheduled by taking most fridays off are also a thing of the past			1
to boost the @entity11 's woeful productivity , @entity15 leaders are vowing to work five days a week			1
opinion : @entity64 : how @entity66 , president @entity65 can get things done for sen. @entity69 , @entity70 , who during the last @entity66 served as president pro tempore of the @entity11 ( the most senior senator from the majority party ) , the change means he 's no longer third in line to the presidency as called for in the @entity76			1
that change also means he loses the @entity79 detail that was assigned drive him and be with him at all times -- arguably a tough perk to give up			0
sen. @entity82 , @entity83 , now has that privilege			0
i guarantee it 's tough , " said sen. @entity86 , with a wry smile when asked how the @entity18 will cope getting used to the minority			1
@entity86 , who has seen the control of the chamber change several times over his three decades in the @entity11 , said the hardest part may be that " you 're used to setting the agenda " and " you 're used to reporting out your own legislation			1
" @entity3 sen. @entity97 of @entity0 , who last year chaired the influential @entity98 , agreed that " not setting the agenda " will be the most frustrating part of not being in the majority			0
" but i 've been in the minority before and it 's a great opportunity to outline and fight for the things you care about			2
" @entity18 recognize they will draw much of their power and relevance over the next two years because there is a @entity35 is in the @entity109 who can veto @entity15 legislation and they can vote to uphold those vetoes			1
" ultimately , when we veer towards the most partisan issues , the @entity109 becomes a major player , " said sen. @entity113 , the second - ranking @entity35			0
" and the president 's veto pen becomes a major element and 34 @entity3 senators become decisive , " he said , referring to the number of @entity18 needed to prevent @entity15 from overriding a presidential veto			2
one thing that does n't change with the switch is the location of @entity64 's suite of offices and the suite occupied by the now minority leader @entity128			2
both suites are very large and have gorgeous views down the @entity131 to the @entity132 and @entity133			0
years ago , the parties decided they would n't go through the labor and expense of moving the leaders ' offices whenever the majority changed			0
@entity64 may regret that now			0
while @entity128 's office is sequestered in a back hallway , largely off limits to the press , @entity64 's office sits in a more public area in the center of the building			0
that means whenever he leaves his office he will run into the gauntlet of reporters who pester him regularly			0
while @entity64 was in the minority , he was disciplined and tight - lipped , rarely giving a usable quote			2
but the pressure on him to answer questions is sure to increase now that he 's running the @entity11 and reporters will be hanging on his every word .			2

most @entity18 have never been in the minority
new *status* in @entity11 will require *adjustment* for many *democrats*
