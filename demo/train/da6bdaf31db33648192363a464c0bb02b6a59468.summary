-- eye - popping physiques , multimillion dollar incomes , celebrity status -- and that 's just the women			1
when you 're dating one of the top footballers on the planet , the pressure to be " perfect " is huge			1
in football 's answer to @entity15 , media scrutiny of elite players is fierce			1
and the paparazzi is just as hungry for images of their wives and girlfriends -- dubbed " wags " by the @entity23 tabloids			1
lenses are snapped with even more ferocity during the @entity26 , as @entity27 , former partner to @entity29 team manager @entity28 , found out to her cost			2
" it is quite sexist and in many cases really not quite fair , the way they were looking at partners , " said the glamorous 52 - year - old @entity33 - @entity32 lawyer , in her lilting @entity35 accent			1
" it was quite intrusive , and that was independent of my will , " added @entity27 , who for almost a decade watched her high - profile relationship play out across the front and back pages of the press			2
" but when you are next to a personality so important in football you become absorbed in that role			1
" as with all social groups , there was a @entity21 hierarchy			1
" there 's a difference between if you are the partner of the manager , than if you are the partner of a footballer , " says @entity27 in between sips of ginger tea , at @entity59 's swank member 's only club at the @entity60			2
" it was always ' @entity27 plus any other of what you might call wags , ' " she adds with a raised eyebrow			0
" so in this way i was quite distinctive , i was never part of that world			1
" she 's got the look it 's a world of glossy women with shopping habits as expensive as their bodies , if you believe the stereotypes splashed across celebrity magazines			1
in truth , partners face enormous pressures to live up to @entity87 doll ideals of beauty			1
" no one wants to be the ugly @entity21 , " says author and newspaper columnist " @entity21 , " wife of an @entity96 player who has kept her identity a mystery , while revealing the inner workings of her lavish lifestyle			1
" we 're put under so much pressure to look as perfect as we can			1
we 're all striving to be the thinnest , the prettiest , the one with the nicest hair			0
" the relentless drive for perfection comes from a fear of " being traded in for a newer model " when temptation beckons , she says			0
" mostly it 's our own personal insecurities , because you know footballers do n't have great reputations			0
there 's so many kiss - and - tell stories in the newspapers , and we all live in fear that this is going to happen to us			0
" footballers today are n't just guys who kick a ball about			0
they 're dating supermodels , actresses			0
" for us normal girls who do n't have careers in the public eye , it 's a massive pressure to live up to			1
" power couple that 's not to say the partners of footballers are simply pretty accessories -- in some cases , they 're even more famous than their sporting beaus			1
@entity137 and @entity138 need n't rely on high - profile lovers @entity140 and @entity141 for their own successful music careers			1
" @entity145 's book has sold more copies than her husband @entity152 's , " said @entity147 , sports editor of @entity23 newspaper the @entity149 , and author of " wags at the @entity26			1
" " it 's a really interesting phenomenon to get your head around , because she 's only famous because she 's going out with a successful @entity96 footballer			1
" cinderella story ? with top players earning over $ 70 million a year , dating one can be an instant ticket to fame and fortune			2
" a footballer could take you from a world where you 're living a basic existence in social housing , to living in a multimillion dollar mansion and traveling the world , " says @entity162			2
" it has a @entity172 quality to it , and i think that 's what we find so appealing			0
" already a successful property lawyer in @entity32 by the time she met @entity28 , @entity180 's is hardly a rags to riches tale			2
but since dating the @entity182 , she has become a @entity23 celebrity in her own right , hosting tv program " @entity191 , " appearing on " @entity186 , " and soon to perform her own stand - up show at @entity190 's @entity189			0
she admits the relationship " probably did help " raise her public profile			0
" but it 's not the only thing , " says the immaculate entrepreneur in a stylish lemon two - piece skirt suit , her raven hair loosely piled high			0
as for the suggestion women pursue footballers as a career move -- @entity27 's eyes open wide in horror			1
" i find it ridiculous this opinion , " she says haughtily , her earrings jangling in agreement			0
" and negative , because there 's a lot of jealousy involved probably			0
but it 's a little bit stupid , if you do n't mind me saying			0
" of course it 's only about love			0
every couple together , it should be love			0
" give and take dating a footballer is not a relationship for the fainthearted , with women beholden to clubs just as much as their men			2
if that means abstaining in the bedroom before big matches , then so be it			0
" it 's really unfair , " says " @entity21			1
" " my whole life has kind of been following my husband around , you have to up and leave countless times when he moves clubs			0
" i spent many years studying and i 've never been in a situation where i could put all those years to good use			0
" i feel as though i 'm constantly living in the shadow of my husband , and it took a lot of adjustment to accept that			0
" @entity23 phenomenon ? nowhere is the spotlight so intense on footballer 's private lives then in the @entity23 -- " this is the country of gossip , " says @entity27			2
the word " @entity21 " was dreamed up by the @entity23 tabloids during the 2006 @entity26 , and has since made its way into the @entity253			1
at the time , just as much column space was dedicated to @entity137 and @entity256 's shopping sprees , as @entity96 's lackluster performance in @entity258 eight years ago			0
" i think it was a mixture of @entity96 not doing particularly well , so there was nothing much to report on , and the girls just out partying , " says @entity162			2
" you can be very critical of these women and you can analyze what happened to feminism , but the bottom line is , they seem to be having a bloody good time			2
" glamorous as these women may seem , ultimately they are just " normal people trying to be the best mothers and wives they can , " says the " @entity21			1
