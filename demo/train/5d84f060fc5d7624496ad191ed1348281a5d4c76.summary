-- as he works around the clock trying to reach 33 trapped miners in @entity4 , an image flashes through @entity7 's mind : the clothes he saw hanging in their lockers			1
they left them behind on august 5 , the day they went into the depths of the gold and copper mine			0
" seeing things like that , it really gets you thinking , " he said in an interview with @entity0			0
outside the mine , family members are keeping vigil at a place they call " @entity25			0
" meanwhile , @entity7 and a small crew of @entity28 drillers are the tip of the spear for @entity31 , one of the three drilling teams racing to rescue the miners buried 2,300 feet below the ground			1
on thursday , @entity4 mining minister @entity36 said the @entity31 drill was expected to break through into the area where the miners are trapped by saturday			1
it 's a moment @entity7 and other rescuers have been looking forward to for weeks			1
@entity7 said the @entity42 -- normally used for boring water holes -- was 61 meters ( 200 feet ) away from its target thursday night			2
it appeared likely that it would reach the miners ahead of the plan a drill , normally used for drilling ventilation chimneys in mines and the @entity53 method , normally used to drill for oil			1
" you ca n't predict the down times , the breakages , the formation issues , " @entity7 said			2
" i 've felt since we got here , that as long as we had some luck on our side , we 'd have a good chance of breaking through first			0
" @entity7 is based in @entity64 , @entity65 , in the heart of the state 's mining country , thousands of miles from @entity4			1
his company , @entity70 , aided in the rescue of nine miners who were trapped for more than four days after the 2002 collapse of the @entity74			1
he has drilled oil , gas and water holes -- and the foundation for the @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity81			0
but those assignments pale in comparison to the difficulties of rescuing 33 men who became trapped when the copper and gold mine they were working in collapsed around them			0
even in the toughest times at the @entity90 mine , he said , thinking about the workers and their families has fueled rescuers ' efforts			2
" that quickly sets you to where you need to be , " he said			0
" you look down at your feet and you realize that 2,000 feet below us , there 's 33 guys that are in a whole hell of a lot worse situation than we are			2
" depending on whether engineers decide to encase the rescue shaft with steel casing , the 33 miners could be extracted from the collapsed @entity112 gold and copper mine between two and 10 days after breakthrough			2
@entity7 , who only knows a few @entity115 words , said he 's still not sure what he 'll say when they meet face - to - face			1
" i think it 's just going to be a lot of handshakes and hugs ... it 's going to be an absolutely overwhelming sensation , " he said			0
