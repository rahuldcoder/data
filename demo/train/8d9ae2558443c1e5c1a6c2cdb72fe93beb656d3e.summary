-- the systematic use of performance enhancing substances within @entity6 's former @entity5 team has been detailed by one cyclist who resisted the temptation to dope			1
a @entity9 ( @entity9 ) report accused seven - time @entity12 winner @entity6 of being involved in " the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen			1
" @entity6 's representatives dismissed the 1,000 - page report as " a hatchet job " , but the experiences of former @entity5 cyclist @entity19 suggest a culture of doping existed within the team before @entity6 joined 14 years ago			1
@entity19 claims he was given steroids by team doctor @entity24 as part of a grueling training program in 1997 , a year before @entity6 joined the team			1
@entity24 did not reply when asked for a response by @entity0 , but he has denied the accusations to other media outlets			1
" the only race i did that spring was in @entity33 , called the @entity34 , " @entity19 explained to @entity0 , referring to the 1997 season			1
" @entity24 called the riders into his room one by one , and when i got there he gave me a training program			1
" this program was on a calendar			2
we were supposed to recover because it had been a hard season , but there was a two - week block , about 16 days , where on each day he had dots or stars			2
" we were supposed to do 200 to 250 kilometers per day			2
i asked him , ' what are these stars and dots for ? ' he handed me a zip lock bag full of pills and vials			0
i asked him , ' what do i have here ? ' and he said , ' these are steroids			2
' he said , ' you will go strong like bull			0
' " steroids increase the speed at which muscles can be built , although they can enhance masculine characteristics			2
@entity19 was warned to not take any of the pills or liquids while he was racing , but he made the decision to avoid taking any of the substances			1
he persevered with his own training regime , but simply could not keep up with his teammates			2
" i was living in @entity69 at that time , " continued @entity19			1
" i decided to talk to my wife and that is when i decided i did n't want to be a professional anymore			0
" i attempted to do the training program anyway and still got pretty fit , but you could n't go everyday			0
" most people think you bulk up on steroids , but all it really does is allow you to recover so you can do the same effort			2
if you 're doing endurance , you will stay light and get fast			0
" statistics back up what @entity19 suggests			1
the @entity12 's @entity86 is one of the most storied ascents in cycling and in 1986 , five - time general classification winner @entity84 completed the climb in 48 minutes			0
@entity91 now holds the record for the climb			0
his time , set in 1997 , is 10 minutes and 25 seconds faster than that of @entity84			2
@entity6 clocked a time of 37 minutes and 36 seconds , just one second slower than @entity91 , in 2004			1
@entity91 , who was ejected from the 1999 @entity97 following an abnormal blood reading , died of a cocaine overdose in 2004			0
@entity19 feels that @entity24 thought he was acting in the best interests of the riders , helping them to compete while also preventing them seeking drugs via riskier avenues			1
dr @entity106 replaced @entity24 at the @entity108 postal team in 1999			1
@entity24 was sacked as @entity6 " did not feel that @entity24 was aggressive enough in running the ' program , ' " according to the evidence given to @entity9 by @entity108 postal rider @entity111			1
" @entity24 was looking out for our interests , " said @entity19			1
" he was n't doing anything that anyone else was n't doing			0
he was trying to make sure the team would be competitive in a safe way			2
" i really think he was trying to help us with our health so we were n't doing it in some back alley			0
" while @entity19 admits to occasionally wondering what might have been had he decided to dope , he has no regrets over his decision to turn his back on professional cycling			2
" people have said , ' geez , it was such a brave thing you did			0
' i did have a contract with @entity132 to go on for ' 98 , i 'm not sure i look at it the same way			0
" it was heartbreaking but i knew that if i went and continued racing in ' 98 , i was n't going to be strong enough to continue to race with my peers putting me in the gutter and me not being competitive			0
i knew i would do what i had to do to be competitive			0
" i guess to avoid that situation i think is cowardly			0
but i decided i 'm not strong enough , i need to move out of my profession			0
" now team doctor with @entity142 , the last team @entity6 raced for , @entity24 will go before the @entity143 later this year as he contests the charges brought against him by @entity9			1
despite the success enjoyed by other members of the @entity142 such as @entity148 gold medalist @entity147 and @entity149 , who rode alongside @entity6 in each of his seven @entity12 wins , @entity19 is happy with the decision he made to preserve his integrity rather than chase fame and fortune			1
both @entity147 and @entity149 testified against @entity6 in @entity9 's report , while admitting to using performance enhancing substances			1
" i would n't trade places with @entity149 and his millions , or @entity147 and his @entity148 medal			0
" my wife said to me , ' imagine you 're coming home and telling your son and daughter daddy is a liar , a cheat and a fraud			0
you do n't have to do that			0
' " so i feel good about the decision i 've made , i would n't change anything			0
" both @entity147 and @entity149 testified against @entity6 in @entity9 's report , while admitting to using performance enhancing substances .			1
