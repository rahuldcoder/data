@entity0 -- fresh political sex scandals , following closely on the @entity4 affair , have @entity5 gripped by a debate on the nation 's hidden culture of sexism and how its tough privacy laws , which prevent journalists from exposing sexual misbehavior , help perpetuate it			1
in the latest development , former @entity5 education minister @entity13 was talking to police as a witness friday at the department for the protection of minors in @entity0 after suggesting on national television that a former government minister is known to have abused children in @entity23 , @entity24			1
the comments arose during a discussion on whether former @entity28 head @entity4 's supposedly well - known sexual impulsiveness had been kept quiet because it was seen as a private matter			1
" all of us here probably know who i 'm talking about , " @entity13 told the panel on the daily @entity5 political show " @entity32			1
" asked if he had any proof , he said , " of course not			2
but i have testimony from @entity39 members at the highest level , state authorities at the highest level			2
" he went on to say he had been informed " particularly by the prime minister			2
" @entity13 refused to name the former minister because of the privacy laws , saying , " if i let his name out now , it 's me who will be charged and doubtlessly convicted , even if i know that the story is true			1
" since the comments were made tuesday evening , rumors have been spreading about who @entity13 was talking about , with the names of several high - profile politicians being mentioned			1
@entity13 's comments also followed the resignation sunday of former @entity5 secretary of public affairs @entity58 after two female colleagues accused him of sexually assaulting them while giving them foot massages			1
the two women told @entity5 press that the @entity4 case had inspired them to come forward			1
one of the women , identified only as @entity65 , told @entity5 reporters , " we will not withdraw our complaint			0
i am determined to see it through regardless of unpleasant things that could be spread about me			2
" the accumulation of affairs has brought out a flurry of personal testimony in @entity5 from highly placed women politicians and officials who now feel empowered to speak out on the issue of sexual harassment by men in politics			0
@entity80 , mistress of former @entity5 foreign minister @entity81 , told @entity1 , " in @entity5 we do n't talk about that			2
up until now it was very difficult			0
" imagine a woman who is sexually pursued by a politician , what can she do ? go to the justice and complain ? immediately they will laugh at her			0
so i hope this will change things			1
" @entity95 , a member of the @entity96 , told @entity1 : " clearly it 's an issue			2
i started my career quite a long time ago and throughout its course i was faced with sexist behavior , but i was lucky enough to overcome those difficulties			0
" @entity103 , @entity104 spokeswoman , told the @entity5 media : " in @entity5 , 80 % of the political sphere is dominated by men and male political journalists			0
so yes , we suffer and you harden yourself to it			0
you have to when you hear 15 sexist jokes in a row			0
it is sexual harassment disguised as humor			0
some ca n't come to work wearing a skirt			0
" similarly @entity120 , current minister of @entity121 and @entity122 said : " recently something big has been taking place : a real omerta is being lifted , reinforced by a judicial system that protects privacy			1
i think politicians have understood that respecting privacy has its limits now			0
" is this a good thing ? yes , of course			0
how could i not rejoice the end of impunity ? "			1

the @entity4 affair and the @entity137 *incident* have helped raise awareness
former education minister @entity13 says he knows of an official who abused children
" i hope this will change things , " a former minister 's mistress says
@entity120 : " how could i not rejoice the end of impunity ? "
