the terrorist attacks in @entity1 on december 29 and 30 are an ominous sign that the decision to hold the @entity4 in @entity5 may lead to one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of the @entity9			1
many of the 120,000 persons expected to visit the @entity9 do not realize that they are walking into what effectively is a war zone			1
the inability of the @entity16 authorities to prevent attacks was on display in @entity1 , a key connecting point for those en route to @entity5			1
on december 29 , a suicide bomber blew herself up in the entrance of the @entity1 railway station			1
@entity16 president @entity24 responded with extraordinary security measures			1
the next day , on december 30 , a suicide bomber in the same city blew himself up in a bus			0
@entity29 is the most important holiday in @entity16 but people in the major cities , including @entity33 , are not in a celebratory mood			1
the social media is full of warnings not to use public transport			0
in @entity1 , the local police are being flooded with reports about supposed new explosions and a number of factories have requisitioned buses to transport their employees to and from work			2
in 2007 , when @entity24 persuaded the @entity47 to choose @entity5 , there were already powerful reasons to refuse			0
@entity16 representatives depicted @entity16 as a " young democracy " but political opposition had been suppressed and investigative journalists murdered			2
at the same time , the @entity54 insurrection was growing in the @entity55 , directly adjacent to the proposed @entity47 sites			0
what tipped the balance in @entity5 's favor was @entity24 's personal lobbying and a @entity16 offer of $ 12 billon in preparations , twice what was proposed by the other two candidates			1
the choice of @entity5 was treated , in the words of @entity67 , who organized the bid , as " a key moment in @entity16 history			2
" the @entity16 authorities began pouring money into grandiose transport and construction projects			1
it is common for @entity47 infrastructure to end up costing twice the initial estimate but in @entity16 it cost $ 50 billion , more than four times the initial estimate , with $ 7 billion in contracts going to one of @entity24 's childhood friends			1
reality , however , was beginning to close in			0
@entity16 had contained the @entity85 revolt by granting absolute power and unlimited funding to @entity85 leader @entity88			2
he managed to pacify @entity85 with the help of terror but the insurgency outside of @entity85 was growing			0
after the killing by @entity16 forces in 2005 of the @entity85 separatist leader @entity95 , power passed to @entity97 , a @entity85 field commander who announced that he was beginning a holy war to create an @entity100 state from the @entity101 to the @entity102			1
the number of deaths spiraled , particularly in @entity105			0
in 2009 , the @entity100 turned to terror attacks in @entity16 proper			1
@entity97 took credit for the bombing of a @entity33 to @entity115 train in november 2009 in which 27 persons were killed , two suicide attacks in march , 2010 on the @entity111 in which 40 persons were killed and the suicide bombing in january 2011 of the @entity118 in which 36 persons were killed and 160 injured			0
visitors to the @entity4 now face several dangers that would have been avoided had the @entity47 committee chosen a different location			1
the first danger is from the terrorists			0
despite a security zone around @entity5 and a system of intensive identity checks , it is impossible to guarantee the security of @entity47 visitors totally			1
@entity132 , the former president of @entity85 and the father of the present leader , was killed by a bomb that had been built into one of the supports of the @entity139 stadium six months earlier			0
terrorists can also attack transport hubs like @entity1			2
in addition to the danger from terrorists , however , there is also a danger from the @entity16 forces			2
as past experience shows , in a hostage situation , the @entity16 will make no effort to spare innocent lives			2
in 2002 , when terrorists seized a @entity33 theater and took nearly a thousand persons hostage , @entity16 forces flooded the hall with poison gas killing 129 hostages immediately			0
in 2004 , @entity16 forces attacked a school gymnasium in the southern town of @entity161 full of hostages with grenade launchers and flame throwers killing 334 hostages , including hundreds of children			0
the war that former @entity16 president @entity168 launched in 1994 against @entity85 was supposed to be a " short victorious war " that would boost @entity168 's sagging popularity			1
instead , it set off a conflict that has been claiming victims for 19 years			0
because of the irresponsibility of the @entity47 in indulging @entity24 's desire for a propaganda spectacular , the stage may now be set for there to be many more .			0

deadly attacks in @entity16 's @entity1 put *spotlight* on security during @entity4
