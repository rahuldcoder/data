-- writer - director @entity1 wisely gets back to basics in " @entity3 " after the over the top @entity5 heroics of " @entity6			1
" in their last collaboration , @entity7 fell out of the clouds in a tank and lived to tell the tale			1
this time he 's stranded in the arctic wastes of @entity14 when the plane transporting a crew of rugged oil drillers crashes in the back of beyond			1
the half dozen survivors are in bad shape , with few supplies , no chance of contacting the outside world and little hope of rescue			0
they have sub-zero temperatures to contend with , howling winds and snow , and the only source of meat on the horizon -- a pack of timber wolves -- has its own ideas about the pecking order on the food chain			2
@entity7 quickly emerges as the leader of the men			2
he 's a head taller than anybody else and maybe a head smarter , too			2
he also knows wolves , so he says -- though it 's hard to believe anyone on this movie could claim as much			2
any animal expert could tell you that timber wolves are more likely to run in the opposite direction than give chase to humans			0
compared to a grizzly bear , your typical @entity54 grey is a pussycat			0
that 's not the kind of animal @entity7 and company bump into			1
these puppies are of the big , bad variety : vicious , lethal and relentless			0
@entity7 -- perhaps rashly -- decides to abandon the wrecked plane and strike out south , into the woods			1
he 's followed by a rapidly depleting line of the walking wounded , and a posse of salivating lupus			0
this is bare bones storytelling in more ways than one , though @entity1 ca n't resist injecting stray purple pronouncements of existential angst ( i kept hoping that one of the guys would get hold of the letter @entity7 has stashed in his pocket , the one where he tells the girl who got away he 's exiled himself to live with the dregs of humanity , " ex cons , misfits , a * * * * * * * ... men unfit for mankind " )			1
fortunately he 's a better filmmaker than he is a screenwriter			0
impressively shot in northern @entity91 by the talented @entity92 , the movie feels grounded and real even when the dialogue ( and the angry wolf pack ) rings false			1
interspersing exciting action sequences with tense slogs through hostile terrain , the movie has the structure of a classic western , with wolves standing in for outlaws or @entity103			0
it 's old hat , but it still plays			0
@entity7 's in his element as the raw alpha male who reluctantly takes the others in hand			1
they include an angry , macho @entity113 ( @entity112 ) , a boring nice guy ( @entity114 ) and an ailing black guy ( @entity115 ) who might as well have " @entity117 " tattooed to his forehead			0
even though @entity1 never digs up anything very surprising about these stock characters , the terse , shape - shifting group dynamics are enough to keep us watching			0
the film 's single best sequence comes early on			1
the plane crash -- and the nicely pitched run - up to it , as the passengers ( all men ) stow their bravado and start to grapple with what they might be facing -- is a knockout			1
five minutes of pure white - knuckle drama			0
even though nothing later comes close to it for enterprise or excitement , " @entity3 " remains a genuinely gripping survival story and a refreshing change from stale urban action flicks : " @entity138 " on paws .			2

" @entity3 " is impressively shot in northern @entity91
@entity7 's in his element as the raw alpha male who takes the others in hand
the film 's single best sequence comes early on -- the plane crash
