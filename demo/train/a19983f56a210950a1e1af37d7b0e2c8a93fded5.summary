@entity0 -- @entity2 died while preparing to set a world record for the most successful concert run , but he unknowingly set another record that led to his death			1
@entity2 may be the only human ever to go two months without @entity7 -- rapid eye movement -- sleep , which is vital to keep the brain and body alive			1
the 60 nights of propofol infusions dr. @entity14 said he gave @entity2 to treat his insomnia is something a sleep expert says no one had ever undergone			1
" the symptoms that mr. @entity2 was exhibiting were consistent with what someone might expect to see of someone suffering from total sleep deprivation over a chronic period , " dr. @entity19 , a @entity21 sleep expert , testified friday at the wrongful - death trial of concert promoter @entity23			1
the symptoms documented by e-mails among show producers and testimony from his chef , hairstylist and choreographers included his inability to do standard dances or remember words to songs he sang for decades , paranoia , talking to himself and hearing voices , and severe weight loss , @entity19 said			2
" i believe that that constellation of symptoms was more probably than not induced by total sleep deprivation over a chronic period , " he testified			2
@entity50 disrupts the normal sleep cycle and offers no @entity7 sleep , yet it leaves a patient feeling refreshed as if they had experienced genuine sleep , according to @entity19			1
if the singer had not died on june 25 , 2009 , of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic , the lack of @entity7 sleep may have taken his life within days anyway , according @entity19 's testimony friday			1
lab rats die after five weeks of getting no @entity7 sleep , he said			1
it was never tried on a human until @entity14 gave @entity2 nightly propofol infusions for two months			1
translating that to a human , @entity19 estimated , @entity2 would have died before his 80th day of propofol infusions			1
@entity14 told police he had given it to him for 60 nights before trying to wean him off it on june 22 , 2009 -- three days before his death			0
@entity19 -- who serves as a sleep consultant to @entity76 , the @entity77 and the @entity78 -- testified thursday that the " drug - induced coma " induced by propofol leaves a patient with the same refreshed feeling of a good sleep but without the benefits that genuine sleep delivers in repairing brain cells and the body			1
" it would be like eating some sort of cellulose pellets instead of dinner , " he said			0
" your stomach would be full , and you would not be hungry , but it would be zero calories and not fulfill any of your nutrition needs			0
" depriving someone of @entity7 sleep for a long period of time makes them paranoid , anxiety - filled , depressed , unable to learn , distracted and sloppy , @entity19 testified			1
they lose their balance and appetite while their physical reflexes get 10 times slower and their emotional responses 10 times stronger , he said			0
those symptoms are strikingly similar to descriptions of @entity2 in his last weeks , as described in e-mails from show producers and testimony by witnesses in the trial			1
@entity2 's mother and children are suing @entity23 , contending that the company is liable in his death because it hired , retained or supervised @entity14 , who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter			2
they argue that the promoter pressured @entity14 to get @entity2 to rehearsals while failing to get @entity2 help despite numerous red flags warning that he was in trouble			2
@entity126 , prince @entity2 testimonies shown in @entity2 death trial @entity23 lawyers contend that it was @entity2 who chose , hired and supervised @entity14 , and their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous propofol treatments administered in the privacy of @entity2 's rented mansion			1
a very long question @entity19 was back on the witness stand friday to answer a question that was asked just as court ended thursday			2
@entity2 lawyer @entity140 asked his expert what may also be a record - breaker in a trial : a 15 - minute - long hypothetical question			1
he was asked to render an opinion based on a long list of circumstances presented so far in the trial about @entity2 's condition and behavior , including : that @entity14 administered propofol to @entity2 60 consecutive nights before june 22 , 2009			1
that @entity14 began to wean @entity2 from propofol on june 22 , 2009 , and gave him none of the drug on june 23			1

that show producers reported @entity2 became progressively thinner and paranoid and was talking to himself in his final weeks			1

" that @entity2 was suffering severe chills on a summer day in @entity0 and his skin was cold as ice to the touch			2
lawsuit evidence : @entity2 lost dance moves in last days @entity2 lawyers revised the question friday morning after @entity23 lawyers objected to the information about @entity14 's nightly propofol treatments , since it was derived only from the doctor 's statement to police after @entity2 's death			1
the judge previously ruled that statement inadmissible			0
instead , they brought up evidence that @entity14 ordered more than four gallons of propofol between april and june , which @entity19 said equaled 155,000 milliliters of the drug			2
an anesthesiologist uses between 20 and 30 milliliters to induce a coma for surgery , he said			0

@entity2 died just two weeks before he would have traveled to @entity210 for the premiere of his " @entity212 " comeback concerts , produced and promoted by @entity23			1
a lecture on sleep jurors appeared quite interested as @entity19 lectured them thursday on his sleep research , including an explanation of circadian rhythm : the internal clock in the brain that controls the timing of when we sleep and wake and the timing of the release of hormones " that 's why we sleep at night and are awake in the day , " he said			2
your brain needs sleep to repair and maintain its neurons every night , he said			0
blood cells cycle out every few weeks , but brain cells are for a lifetime , he said			0
" like a computer , the brain has to go offline to maintain cells that we keep for life , since we do n't make more , " he said			0

" @entity1 : sleep an adult should get seven to eight hours of sleep each night to allow for enough sleep cycles , he said			0

your eyes actually dart back and forth rapidly during @entity7 sleep			1
" in @entity7 , we are integrating the memories that we have stored during slow - eyed sleep , integrating memories with previous life experiences , " he said			2
" we are able to make sense of things that we may not have understood while awake			0
" learning and memory happen when you are asleep , he said			0
