@entity0 -- not so long ago , we defined relations between @entity4 and the @entity5 by how its president got along with our president			1
yet , when the @entity5 chief executive is distracted by events in @entity12 and the @entity13 , what counts now is how @entity4 president @entity14 relates to the governors of @entity5 states			1
as @entity5 governors go , @entity14 has his favorites and his not - so - favorites			2
in the first camp , there is @entity23 gov. @entity22 , who seems to be @entity25 's new bff for pursuing a progressive agenda concerning @entity4 living in the @entity27			2
in the second camp , it 's a good bet that you 'll find @entity32 gov. @entity31 , who may be getting ready to fuel a 2016 presidential bid on @entity35 fear - mongering			1
with @entity5 concerned about immigration and drug violence , perhaps @entity31 's gambit is that painting our neighbor as an obstacle to a secure border will play well with voters in conservative arenas like the @entity45			1
during a recent visit to @entity47 , where he spoke to a gathering of several hundred dignitaries and @entity4 and @entity4 - @entity5 leaders , @entity14 praised @entity22 for pursuing a progressive agenda regarding @entity4 living in @entity23			1
the @entity4 leader made clear he is pleased that @entity23 is giving driver 's licenses to undocumented immigrants and making it easier for them to work and start businesses in the @entity27			2
" i want to thank you for what you have done for migrants , especially the ones from @entity4 , " @entity14 told the crowd			0
" it 's no coincidence that my first visit to the @entity5 is in @entity23			2
" as opposed to , well , @entity32 -- which , nonetheless , might have been on @entity14 's mind as he delivered his remarks			2
" there are still states that have not evolved so much as @entity23 , that still skimp on recognition and , even worse , the rights of immigrants , " he said			0
" those who still believe and bet for the exclusion and discrimination or the rejection of diversity ... i only have one thing to say : the future , and a very near future , will demonstrate your ethical mistake			0
time will show we 're right			0
" @entity14 did n't specifically name which states he was talking about			0
but , if you 've been following the news along the @entity5 - @entity4 border recently , you know that , as far as @entity4 is concerned , @entity31 is on the naughty list			1
eager to cast himself as the @entity91 candidate who is best - equipped to protect and defend the homeland against another terrorist attack , @entity31 recently floated the terrifying idea that @entity96 terrorists affiliated with @entity97 could have already entered the @entity5 through the @entity5 - @entity4 border			1
" there 's the obvious great concern that because of the condition of the border , from the standpoint of it not being secure and us not knowing who is penetrating across , that individuals from @entity97 or other terrorist states could be , " @entity31 told a gathering at the @entity99 , the conservative think tank based in @entity100			1
" i think it 's a very real possibility that they may have already used that			0
" it could be a " real possibility " but -- as @entity31 acknowledged -- no evidence backs it up			2
@entity117 press secretary rear adm. @entity116 said on @entity1 's " @entity118 " that the @entity117 has " no information that leads us to believe that " @entity97 was crossing at the @entity5 - @entity4 border			1
" that said , we do know they have aspirations to hit @entity126 targets , and it 's something ... we 've got to take seriously and we have to try and be ready for it			0
" so , if nothing points to this , why would the @entity32 governor say something so irresponsible ? see above , under " @entity45			0
" @entity4 foreign relations secretary @entity133 was not amused			0
he took @entity31 to task , insisting that his statements about @entity96 fundamentalists crossing the @entity5 - @entity4 border were based on nothing more than " beliefs , speculation and absolutely unfounded and absurd analysis			1
" that 's going easy			0
what @entity31 said was n't just absurd			0
the marriage between the @entity5 and @entity4 is vitally important , and it pays dividends in law enforcement , economics , cross-border trade and intelligence gathering			2
a border governor should n't toy with damaging that relationship just to get a leg up on the next presidential election			0
and because @entity31 is a border governor , and thus privy to sensitive information gathered by the @entity32 @entity157 , he has to be especially careful about leaking some of that material -- either in total , or in part -- without putting it in its proper context			1
letting the enemy know what we know is not smart , and it could put @entity5 in danger			1
that 's a high price to pay for a soundbite .			0

@entity32 gov. @entity31 said @entity97 terrorists may come into @entity5 through border with @entity4
@entity175 : @entity117 *rep* said there is no evidence that @entity97 is trying to cross border
@entity175 : @entity31 seems to be *mounting* a bid for president on @entity35 fear - mongering
@entity175 : @entity31 's remarks absurd and put @entity5 - @entity4 ties in danger just to promote himself
