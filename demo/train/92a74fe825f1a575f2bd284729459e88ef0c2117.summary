-- when pictures leaked out in december of the late @entity4 ' new yacht , @entity5 , leaving @entity6 , interest was once again sparked in the mysterious world of the super mega yachts , and in those who build them for the super mega rich			1
i say mysterious because the business of yacht building is full of rumors and speculation until the ship is seen leaving the sheds of the family - owned builders , whether in @entity20 , @entity21 or @entity22			1

the backers of this event are at pains to remind people this business employs thousands of people ( craftsmen , architects , builders , designers , deckhands ) , and when a new anchorage is discovered by the rich and famous to park their yachts , it can generate a lot of income for a region			2

@entity58 , the ceo of @entity59 , told me that superyacht building was actually hurt during the economic crisis			1
it took some time for the slowdown to filter through as orders can take five to seven years to fulfill , so 2011 and 2012 were the tough years			0
but that 's coming to an end			2
watch here : yacht sales down amid austerity " we 've seen the rock bottom of it , " @entity58 stressed			1
" and i think 2013 will be a promising year for the industry , for the big ones			0
" @entity58 said the bigger yacht side of the business is coming back faster than the smaller side			1

his famed @entity84 shipyard in @entity22 will soon unleash the world 's longest mega yacht , codenamed @entity87			1
while @entity82 is not allowed to confirm the owner , or the specifics , he can talk a little bit more once aficionados caught a glimpse of it			1
" the yacht had to leave one shed and flowed through the river to the next shed , and even though the nose was n't on , specialists were there with their instruments and they figured out it , yes it will be longer than what is flowing today			2
" watch here : ' @entity103 ' gather in @entity28 the ' " specialists " estimate it will be around 180 meters long , beating out @entity106 's @entity105 , built by @entity59 , which comes in at 163.5 meters long			1
will they just keep getting longer ? " maybe we will see 200 meters , but i think that 's it , " said @entity58			1
" why do you go for a bigger one if you are alone on it ? " read more : @entity116 yachts glide into @entity28 for a colorful makeover well , not exactly alone , since some of the mega yachts need 60 to 80 employees when the boat is in full use			1
but he has a point			0
we could ask one of the owners , but they tend to like the yacht to do the talking			2
@entity129 of @entity130 built the @entity5 for @entity4 , though he wo n't confirm that			0
but he says building for the mega rich also means building an intimate relationship			1
" it 's very personal			2
i have the cell phone number of my customers			0
" and they have his			0
" oh , yes , and they call me when something breaks down			0
" does that mean @entity141 will do whatever it takes to strike a deal with a tech billionaire or @entity146 sheik ? " i had someone ask me the other day , ' but you ca n't say no to a prince ? ' i said , yes , we do			0
we do it all the time , " @entity141 said , laughing			0
all the builders stress that the ship takes on the personality of the person paying for it , and that things like the interior can change over the years it takes to build the ship			0
but since they only can book a profit once the yacht is delivered , they work hard to find a compromise			0
and @entity141 has something new and special coming out of the shed soon			0
" whereas the @entity5 was about eliminating everything , and going back to even than more than basic , just purity and form in design			0
this project that will be shown to the world , again i ca n't say anything , except that it is very large , and it 's immensely complex and has everything that is included in that one			2
" in other words , while the roofline of @entity5 looks like -- you guessed it -- an @entity178 , the next one will be all about the bling			0
@entity181 will be all about the yacht 's length			2
with the business of big yachts coming back , it 's possible other builders might want to get in on the action			2
@entity190 's family - run yacht builders caution against it			1
" we see military shipyards , commercial shipyards who think , ' oh , ok			0
i 'll do a frigate , paint it white , put a nice interior in it , i have a nice yacht			0
' no way , " said @entity141			0
it 's about the personal touch , as @entity82 stressed			1
" we had a client that had in the contract that i could never resign as a director as long as the yacht is still not delivered , in fact not out of warranty			0
" at a time that @entity190 is very worried about jobs , the uptick in interest for mega yachts should be looked at in a positive light , even if news reports will soon be filled with gossip ( and jealousy ? ) over @entity181 and the " bells and whistles " yachts to soon sail away from the shores of @entity190 to the @entity220 .			1
