@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is due to visit @entity5 stadium in @entity0 wednesday on the second day of her landmark tour to @entity1			1
the visit to @entity5 is another significant symbolic gesture of reconciliation -- @entity11 troops opened fire on a crowd watching a gaelic football match there in 1920 , killing 14			1
on wednesday morning the queen met the @entity1 prime minister @entity17 and senior cabinet ministers at @entity19 as part of her state tour , the first by a @entity11 monarch since the country gained independence in 1921			1
@entity26 , editor of the @entity27 , said : " this is a triumph of really careful planning and shows a strong intent on both sides to make it work			0
" on tuesday the queen laid a wreath at the @entity35 in @entity0 in a joint ceremony with @entity1 president @entity37			1
the @entity35 honors those who fought for @entity1 freedom from @entity11 rule			1
during her stay , the queen will also visit the @entity45 in @entity46 and on wednesday evening , accompanied by @entity11 prime minister @entity47 , the queen will attend a state banquet at @entity49			1
the visit has prompted police to mount a major security operation amid threats of dissident republican violence			2
@entity55 has spent $ 42 million on security for the visit , according to officials			2
on tuesday scuffles between protesters and police broke out in central @entity0 , 22 people were arrested			0
the @entity1 military tuesday defused a bomb tuesday morning on a bus headed to @entity0			2
the military had stopped a private bus in @entity69 , evacuated the passengers and found a " viable device " in the luggage compartment , a spokesman for the @entity1 national police said			2
the queen 's visit is one that many in @entity1 believed would never happen , and marks the reconciliation between two neighboring countries that once viewed each other with suspicion and hostility			1
@entity55 's fight to free itself from its former imperial master is likely to form much of the narrative of the visit			2
there will be constant reminders of the violent past			0
the queen 's plane touched down , for example , at @entity90 , a military airfield named after @entity92 , who was executed for treason in 1916 for conspiring with the @entity94			0
his fate was sealed when the queen 's grandfather , @entity97 , refused to commute his death sentence			0
the @entity100 that the killing was a part of directly led to the partition of @entity1 in 1921			2
the majority of the island gained independence , but six of the nine counties of the province of @entity110 chose to stay in the @entity11 , eventually becoming the country of @entity1			1
in the late 1960s the conflict between mainly @entity114 unionists who want @entity1 to remain part of the @entity11 and largely @entity118 nationalists who want the @entity119 to be reunited with the rest of @entity1 exploded into a political and sectarian war , known as the @entity122			1
the ensuing three decades of violence between the @entity124 and loyalists claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people , most of them north of the border , and while the @entity131 , signed in 1998 , effectively ended the conflict , suspicions remain			0
it is for this reason that the queen 's visit is more than symbolic			0
under the terms of the accord , terrorist groups on both sides dumped their weapons , and political allies of both sides now work together in @entity1 's power - sharing government			2
the change has been so rapid that , even as recently as the late 1990s , one journalist said he could never have imagined a state visit by the queen			1
@entity149 , who covered @entity55 for the @entity150 , said while some people on both sides still have their doubts over the visit -- for different reasons -- more significant is the peaceable language used in the debate			0
" some @entity118 will see this as @entity11 cementing its claim over the @entity1 territory of the six counties of @entity1 , " @entity149 said			1
meanwhile " the @entity114 will see the queen 's visit as ratification of a state that they believe is constitutionally hostile to any @entity11 presence in @entity1			1
so on both sides there 'll be qualms			0
" @entity170 , a pivotal figure in @entity1 history as long - time leader of @entity174 , the @entity124 's political arm , said the queen 's visit was " premature			1
" compared with incendiary language he had used in the past , @entity170 ' comment speaks volumes , @entity149 said			0
for instance , " when the queen 's cousin @entity180 was killed by the @entity124 in 1979 , ( @entity170 ) said it was an execution that was fully justified			0
" " when i was there the @entity124 cease - fire had collapsed , there was violence and killings , no surrender , no compromise			0
in those days there was no likelihood of the queen ever visiting			0
" @entity2 's @entity195 and @entity196 contributed to this report .			0
