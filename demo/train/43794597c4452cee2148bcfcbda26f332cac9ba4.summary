-- with the latest reports of fake lists of dead veterans and alleged electronic coverups still going on at @entity7 hospital , it 's clear the disaster that has become the @entity9 is just getting worse			1
so now more than ever , we have a duty to call on our leaders to right the wrongs we have found and prevent more from taking place			2
our veterans , who survived hand grenades and bullets , are now facing a growing threat from three - ring binders and manila folders -- and a @entity9 culture reluctant to measure , too slow to adapt and not responsive to their needs			1
to truly fix this problem , we must follow where the evidence takes us			1
for thousands of veterans in this country -- and those returning home from more than a decade at war -- the stakes could not be higher			0
the true cost of an antiquated system , slow technological upgrades , and the inability to track performance of the system itself can now be measured in thousands waiting far too long for care , and perhaps the tragic deaths of our brave heroes who may have waited too long for care			2
the next leader of the @entity9 has a lengthy to - do list			1
after all , secretary @entity45 's resignation did not reduce any backlogs or streamline the complex bureaucracy that exists and has harmed our veterans			0
and virtually all of those responsible for setting up and maintaining the culture of deception that has produced this scandal still have jobs			2
until we can accurately measure and use information to evaluate what works and what does n't -- and then address the problems our veterans face -- the rooms piled full of files and paperwork are not going anywhere , and veterans will continue to be neglected			0
the @entity9 has had challenges under both @entity68 and @entity69 administrations -- and if ever there was a bipartisan problem in need of bipartisan solutions , this is it			1
here 's where we should start : 1			0
improve the systems : we must continue to modernize the va system through technology and data - driven approaches that demand results and make evaluation possible			2
the transition to electronic medical records is good , but not enough			0
collect and evaluate data : the backlog , and outdated and inaccurate tracking systems , fogged our ability to realize the scope of the problem and provide the care veterans deserve			2
the @entity9 has an opportunity to learn from their mistakes and change their culture to one that tracks results and is responsive to the data they collect			1
@entity98 veterans deserve a system that meets the standard of excellence they set through their service			2
collecting data from not only the investigations , but into the future as well will enable the @entity9 to evaluate what is working and what needs more attention , funding or repair			1
meet the needs of veterans through smart deployment of resources : as a former chairman of the @entity117 and director of the @entity119 , i can safely say that throwing money at a problem has n't and does n't fix it -- and neither does blindly cutting funding			1
i am glad the @entity9 was spared from sequestration cuts , as the @entity9 has , despite funding increases , a classic problem of supply and demand			1
they have a lack of sufficient doctors and health care workers to meet the growing needs of all veterans , including aging vets and those returning from two protracted wars			0
the @entity9 must now ask : what does the evidence in other health care systems tell us about how to efficiently meet the needs of veterans , while strengthening the quality of care and @entity9 health system itself ? funding boosts for an antiquated system alone wo n't help , but looking at what works in other health delivery systems , as well successful public and market strategies will			1
establish strong leadership and bipartisan buy - in : a lengthy and political @entity155 confirmation process for @entity157 's replacement will do nothing for our veterans			0
what the @entity9 needs now is strong leadership and bipartisan support for the next secretary which will give that individual a mandate to change the culture and fix the broken systems			1
listen to the customers : in business , there is no substitute for listening to the customers			0
the same goes for our nation 's veterans			0
a nationally representative survey of veterans accessing the @entity9 health care system should be conducted immediately to fully understand the depth and breadth of the problems they have faced beyond long waiting periods for their appointments			1
it will also give the new @entity9 leadership some informative data			2
together , we must get the facts , follow the evidence , listen to the veterans themselves , and we should use this as an opportunity for evidence - based , transformational change			0
we made a promise to our military members and their families			0
it is our duty to keep it			0
join us on @entity204 / @entity203 .			0

@entity206 says even as the @entity9 scandal gets worse , we have a duty to fix a broken system
new allegations of secret lists and a coverup have *surfaced* at the @entity9
@entity206 : if ever there was a bipartisan problem in need of bipartisan solutions , this is it
