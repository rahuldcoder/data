@entity1 fans remember hall of famer @entity3 's hitting prowess : 3,141 hits , a .338 batting average and an intense focus at the plate			1
what they probably do n't remember is @entity3 using smokeless tobacco throughout his career -- a habit , @entity3 told @entity14 in 2010 , that he believed gave him cancer			1
@entity3 's use does n't specifically come to mind because so many of his fellow @entity19 players had the same habit			1
a survey administered in 1999 found that close to one - third of rookies starting in the major leagues were already regular smokeless tobacco users			2
more than two - thirds had tried smokeless tobacco			2
other studies found similar rates -- about 30 % -- in the majors in the ' 70s and ' 80s , though smokeless tobacco use among players began declining in the late 1990s ( @entity32 )			2
but it was n't until 2011 that @entity19 implemented rules related to smokeless tobacco products			1
worried about the message it was sending to young fans , @entity19 collaborated with the @entity39 to prohibit teams from providing tobacco to players			1
players can not have tobacco tins in their uniforms or do interviews while using chewing tobacco			2
yet the players ' union stopped short of banning tobacco use on the field			1
smokeless tobacco is the general term for two products : chewing tobacco and snuff			2
though snuff can be inhaled , most users place smokeless tobacco in their mouth and suck on it , periodically spitting out the juices			2
smokeless tobacco contains 28 carcinogens , according to the @entity60 , and is a known cause of oral cancer			1
smokeless tobacco is primarily a male habit , the @entity60 says			2
in 2012 , approximately 11 % of high school boys used smokeless tobacco ; only 1.5 % of girls did			0
nationally , an estimated 6 % of adult men use smokeless tobacco , compared with just 1 % of adult women			0
" current use of smokeless tobacco is about half of what it was in the mid- 1990s , " the @entity68 and @entity69 use website states			0
" however , only a modest decline has occurred since 2010 and no change occurred between 2012 and 2013			0
" @entity3 was diagnosed with cancer in 2010			1
@entity14 reported at the time that the then - 50 - year - old faced chemotherapy and radiation to fight the " slow - moving but aggressive " cancer in his salivary gland			1
there is no scientifically established link between smokeless tobacco and salivary gland cancer , according to the @entity86			1
doctors do n't know what causes salivary gland cancer , but the @entity90 lists old age and radiation as known risk factors			1
" the kind of chewing tobacco @entity3 used does have some risk of oral cancer , but not parotid ( salivary ) gland cancer , which is the kind that took his life at such a young age , " said dr. @entity94 , the council 's medical director			1
@entity3 is n't the only former ballplayer to battle oral cancer			1
most notably , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 were all diagnosed after years of chewing tobacco use			0
@entity107 became a passionate advocate against tobacco after he returned to the field following treatment , according to the @entity114			1
still , players say the habit is hard to break			0
" i use it as a stimulator when i go to hit , " @entity118 star @entity117 told the @entity119			0
" but the minute i finish my at - bat , i spit it out			0
it keeps me smooth and puts me in a good mood			0
i do n't do it in the off season			0
i do n't really like it that much , to be honest with you			0
" @entity129 , the addictive substance found in cigarettes , occurs naturally in all tobacco			0
" over time , a person becomes physically dependent on and emotionally addicted to nicotine , " according to the @entity135			0
those who do try to quit experience withdrawal , often for weeks after their last spit or chew			0
withdrawal symptoms can include irritability , dizziness , depression , headaches and weight gain , according to the @entity135			0
@entity145 @entity3 dies opinion : the joy of @entity3			2

@entity3 died at age 54 after battling salivary gland cancer
he 's not the only @entity19 player to battle oral cancer
@entity19 implemented rules in 2011 but has n't banned tobacco use on the field
