" blaming his schedule , @entity2 left @entity23 after his speech before answering many questions posed to him , @entity35 said			1
hundreds gathered to protest @entity2 's appearance , incensed that a leader who has publicly denied the @entity9 and called for the destruction of the state of @entity50 was given a prestigious forum to espouse his beliefs			1
@entity53 , speaker of the @entity54 , said @entity23 should not be giving @entity2 a platform			1
" all he will do on that stage ... is spew more hatred and more venom out there to the world , " she said			0
@entity61 , a professor of @entity3 studies at @entity23 , called the whole forum " misguided			1
" refusing to back off of his stance on @entity50 , @entity2 again questioned whether the @entity9 happened			1
" if the @entity9 is a reality of our time , a history that occurred , why is there not sufficient research that can approach the topic from different perspectives ? " he asked			0

" if the root causes of 9/11 are examined properly -- why it happened , what caused it , what were the conditions that led to it , who truly was involved , who was really involved -- and put it all together to understand how to prevent the crisis in @entity119 , fix the problem in @entity175 and @entity119 combined			0
" he stressed repeatedly that @entity3 wants to negotiate with the @entity32 and other nations , several times describing @entity3 as a " cultured " and " civilized " nation			2
" i think that if the @entity32 administration , if the @entity32 government puts aside some of its old behaviors , it can actually be a good friend for the @entity3 people , for the @entity3 nation , " he said			2
" for 28 years , they 've consistently threatened us , insulted us , prevented our scientific development , every day , under one pretext or another			0
