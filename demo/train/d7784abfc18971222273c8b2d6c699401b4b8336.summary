@entity0 -- the @entity2 vetoed friday a @entity4 resolution that would have declared @entity6 settlements in the @entity7 illegal			1
@entity2 ambassador to the @entity0 @entity9 said that while the @entity2 agrees about " the folly and illegitimacy of continued @entity6 settlement activity , we think it unwise for this council to attempt to resolve the core issues that divide @entity6 and @entity14			1
" the veto is the first to be used under the @entity20 administration			1
ambassador @entity21 , the permanent observer of @entity22 to the @entity0 , objected to the veto in a statement following the vote			1
" the proper message that should have been sent by the @entity4 to @entity6 , the occupying power , is that its contempt of international law and the international community will no longer be tolerated , " he said			2
" we fear , however , that the message sent today may be one that only encourages further @entity6 intransigence and impunity			1
" @entity34 noted conversations in recent days between @entity2 and @entity14 leaders in an attempt to compromise on the issue of @entity6 settlements			1
" in recent days , we offered a constructive alternative course that we believe would have allowed the council to act unanimously to support the pursuit of peace , " she said			0
" we regret that this effort was not successful and thus is no longer viable			0
" @entity6 praised the veto , saying in a statement that the decision " contributes to the resumption of the diplomatic process and ( it ) regrets that the other @entity4 members have refrained from making the same contribution			2
" @entity2 president @entity20 on thursday called @entity55 president @entity54 to discuss the resolution and speak about alternatives to a @entity4 vote , according to a diplomatic source			1
among the options that had been floated , @entity61 and @entity14 officials said , was the issuance of a @entity4 presidential statement , which is weaker than an actual resolution			2
@entity20 told @entity54 that if he did n't withdraw the resolution , it would put the @entity2 in an awkward position and that @entity2 - @entity14 relations would suffer as a result , the source said			1
" well , there were attempts at persuasion , ( but ) let me put it politely : we are even more persuaded by the rights of the @entity14 people , " said @entity77 , a veteran @entity14 legislator and @entity79 executive committee member			0
" we are more committed to international law and to the requirements of peace , and all these require that settlement activity should stop and that the @entity4 should take a resolution condemning all settlement activities as being illegal and as being in direct contradiction of the requirement of peace			0
" the @entity79 met friday and decided to move forward with the vote , the diplomatic source said , adding that @entity54 felt that at a time when so many leaders are either being toppled or facing massive protests , it would make him look weak if he opted for an alternative course			0
the @entity14 territories have not had the kinds of demonstrations seen in many @entity104 countries , but the @entity106 leaders of the @entity55 have been under criticism since @entity108 published secret papers claiming to reveal that @entity14 officials were prepared to make wide - ranging concessions in negotiations with @entity6			2
the @entity20 administration has been critical of @entity6 settlement construction but has not gone as far as to call it " illegal			1
" @entity34 reaffirmed the @entity2 stance friday , saying after the vote that friday 's veto should not be " misunderstood to mean we support settlement activity			0
" " on the contrary , we reject in the strongest terms the legitimacy of continued @entity6 settlement activity , " she said			0
since the breakdown of @entity61 - brokered talks with @entity6 in september over the issue of settlements , the @entity55 has been pursuing a policy aimed at unilaterally declaring a @entity14 state by september based on borders from 1967 and in recent months has won recognition from a number of @entity61 countries			1
the @entity2 and @entity6 oppose the unilateral efforts , insisting that all issues in the conflict must be dealt with through direct negotiations			0
following the vote , @entity6 joined the @entity2 in once again calling for direct negotiations			0
" only thus , and not through seizing the @entity4 , will it be possible to advance the peace process so as to benefit both parties and to serve the cause of peace and security throughout the region , " said a statement released by @entity6 's @entity142			2
the @entity150 also praised the veto , saying the action prevented " another one - sided , anti-israeli resolution from being enacted by the @entity4			0
" @entity1 's @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .			0

the veto is the first to be used by the @entity2 under the @entity20 administration
