@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 slowly lifts her arm sleeves , and then her left pant leg			1
she turns her head toward the white wall and takes a deep breath			2
she ca n't look at her skin , scarred and chapped from the acid thrown on her during an attack by @entity15 militia members in @entity16			1
even worse are the mental scars she lives with daily , as one of perhaps thousands of @entity20 refugees living in the @entity22 suburb of @entity0 who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder , known as @entity25			1
despite the @entity28 troop withdrawal from @entity20 , refugees continue to flow into @entity28			1
many of them , officials say , have suffered primary and secondary trauma			2
only a fraction of them seek treatment			2
@entity36 , a @entity37 , was leaving her family 's @entity16 jewelry store with her nephew in 2004 when four masked men drove down the same road			1
they struck her with the car , and then proceeded to beat her			2
" i was trying to unmask them , " she says			2
" they dropped acid on my body			2
they tried to burn my face			2
my flesh was like meat			2
" an onlooker shot his kalashnikov into the air to try and scare off the men			2
before fleeing , they slashed @entity3 's stomach open and left her in the street to die			1
@entity60 received treatment in @entity20 and moved to @entity62 for several years			1
the doctors needed to remove her uterus because of complications from her stomach injury			2
she also had reconstruction on her leg and needed treatment for the acid burns			2
she was eventually resettled as a @entity28 refugee in 2008			1
but the memory of that day , she says while wrinkling a tissue in her hand , will stick with her forever			0
her wounds are triggers bringing her back to that day in @entity16			0
she relives every moment -- she sees the masks , and feels her skin burning			0
it is like living the attack all over again -- a classic symptom of @entity25			2
" i felt like i was going crazy , " @entity36 says , shaking her head			1
" i used to close all the windows and have them locked all the time			0
i thought the workers from the restaurant upstairs were going to come down and rape me			0
" @entity36 , now 46 , was diagnosed with @entity25 last year when she was enrolled in a psychosocial rehabilitation program for victims of torture in @entity92 , @entity1			1
the program is run by @entity94 , a community organization dedicated to empowering and enabling individuals and families in the @entity22 area			0
@entity3 's story is similar to others who lived in @entity20 throughout the war			1
for @entity37 , religious persecutions by @entity15 militias were especially common , and the victims were forced to leave their homes			0
the transition into their new countries , including the @entity28 , only exacerbated the ptsd symptoms			1
@entity3 is one of an influx of @entity20 refugees and asylum seekers who have come to @entity28			1
according to the @entity113 , @entity28 has resettled more than 2,500 @entity20 since march 31 this year alone			1
@entity0 is home to the largest @entity115 - @entity28 population in the country , many of them from @entity20			1
the exact number of @entity20 living in the @entity28 is not clear			1
the statistic is fogged by the different classifications of foreigners -- asylum seekers , people who have been permanently resettled as refugees and those who are living illegally in the country			0
wars prompt disturbing rise in refugees @entity129 , a lead therapist at @entity94 , says his group serves just over 300 clients , most of whom are @entity20 @entity134			1
sixty clients suffered direct physical torture , he says , and are now dealing with severe ptsd			0
their symptoms include nightmares , insomnia , intense anger , and poor concentration			0
@entity36 says her most pressing symptom is insomnia			1
she started receiving medication to help her fall asleep , but she became too dependent on it			0
" it became a problem , " she says			0
" i am now trying to slowly go off of the medication			0
but it 's a process			2
" the 300 clients served by access are thought to be only a sliver of those suffering from ptsd in the @entity22 area			0
in 2011 , @entity22 and @entity154 experienced an influx of 3,500 new asylum seekers			0
the majority of those are @entity20 chaldeans who are likely suffering mental and emotional effects of trauma			1
many of them , however , do not seek services			0
" there is a stigma of mental health in the @entity115 world , " @entity129 says			1
" there are no such services in @entity20 , because people there act like there is no mental health ( issues ) in @entity20			1
at access we try to help them find meaning for new life , new goals			0
" @entity179 , program manager at the access rehabilitation center , says ptsd is more widespread than many realize -- that thousands are suffering and will continue to suffer as they are resettled in upcoming years			0
the next immediate concern for @entity94 , he says , will be the additional influx of refugees affected by the @entity187 conflict			0
@entity188 , director of the division of refugee services at the federal @entity191 , says his organization has consistently funded access over the past five years because it understands the need to address the demand for mental health services among the refugee population in @entity1			1
" these people are facing challenges that normal @entity28 do not			1
they have been uprooted , and they did n't have a choice , " he says			0
soccer helping young refugees find footing in @entity28 @entity94 is now in its second year of funding of a three - year grant from @entity191			1
they receive $ 175,000 for what @entity191 has dubbed an " ethnic " grant			0
according to the @entity191 website , the grant access receives is designed to provide " refugee populations with critical services to assist them in becoming integrated members of @entity28 society			1
" but in addition , access receives an additional $ 250,000 dedicated solely to helping survivors of torture like @entity3			1
for @entity3 , daily life in @entity1 is far removed from @entity20			1
she spends most of her days in the house , watching tv and preparing meals for herself			0
she does not work because she can not speak @entity222 and finds it difficult to interact with the community around her			0
she spends days , sometimes even weeks , alone			0
her brother lives just a few miles down the road , she says , but she never sees him because he too is suffering from ptsd			0
" i do n't want to hear about any more trauma or anyone else dying , " she says			0
" it hurts too much			0
but i ca n't forget what happened to me			0

@entity36 was injured in a 2004 attack in @entity20
now in the @entity28 , @entity3 struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder
@entity0 is home to the nation 's largest @entity115 - @entity28 population , including @entity20
