-- in the tangled aftermath of the @entity3 17 disaster , two narratives have emerged -- one that most of the world subscribes to , and another that @entity6 and the rebels are pushing			2
in the first , @entity8 was shot down by @entity10 rebels in eastern @entity11 , using a sophisticated @entity6 - built missile system			1
in the second , @entity6 and the rebels suggest several different scenarios for what brought the jetliner down , some of them bordering on the bizarre			2
propaganda is nothing new in world politics			2
since the beginning of time , everyone has put their spin on the events of the day			0
but the word from @entity28 about @entity6 's take ? take any information coming out of @entity31 " with a very large grain of salt			1
" " i would also say that these are n't competing narratives from two equally credible sources here , " said @entity33 , a @entity34 spokeswoman			0
" the @entity6 government has repeatedly put out misinformation and propaganda throughout this conflict in @entity11 , so i would caution you from saying that these are two equally credible sources , although you 're happy to report it that way , but i would take issue with it			1
" the @entity6 mindset , says @entity0 's former @entity31 bureau chief , loves a good story			1
and the @entity6 narrative is meant to sway public opinion on who 's responsible for the jet 's downing			1
" do n't forget , the mentality of @entity6 is to think of conspiracy theories , " said @entity56			0
" so when they hear something that is outrageous , they might believe it			0
" here are some of the stories circulating in the @entity6 media			0
the @entity6 take : the passengers were already dead rebel commander @entity67 suggested that many of @entity8 's passengers were corpses -- already dead -- and put aboard the 11 - plus - hour flight from @entity72 to @entity73			1
those claims were made on @entity6 's @entity76 website			1
" a significant number of the bodies were n't fresh , " @entity67 said he 'd learned , adding , their blood had been drained			0
he also reportedly claimed a vast amount of blood serum and medications were discovered in the wreckage			0
the world 's take : the information contradicts the @entity88 passenger manifest for @entity89 that lists the 298 people who were alive when they boarded the regularly scheduled flight			1
for instance , @entity93 passenger @entity92 was on his way to an @entity96 in @entity97 -- a trip that was to be followed by a backpacking excursion there			0
the day of the crash , @entity92 posted to his @entity103 page a picture of him posing beneath aviator sunglasses and sporting a large travelers ' backpack			0
--- the @entity6 take : a @entity11 fighter jet shot it down on the day of the crash , @entity6 's radar system spotted a @entity11 @entity113 jet approaching the @entity114 , said @entity116 lt. gen. @entity115			1
" its standard armament includes @entity120 air - to - air missiles , which are capable of locking and hitting targets from 12 kilometers ( 7 miles ) and which are guaranteed to hit the target from the distance of 5 kilometers ( 3 miles ) , " he said			0
the world 's take : that 's a claim that @entity11 has denied			1
and the @entity125 and others have said the plane was brought down by a surface - to - air missile			1
" the @entity6 government has a propaganda machine second to none , as these latest conspiracy theories demonstrate , " a @entity125 official told @entity0			0
--- the @entity6 take : @entity135 's plane was the target according to some accounts in the @entity6 media , @entity8 was traveling along almost the same route as president @entity135 's presidential plane , which was returning to @entity31 from a summit in @entity142			1
both planes have red , white and blue markings			0
" the contours of the airplanes are in general similar , the linear dimensions are also very similar and regarding the coloring , from a sufficiently long distance , they are practically identical , " an aviation source was quoted as telling the news outlet , @entity153 the world 's take : another @entity6 media , the online news portal @entity155 , reported that @entity135 's plane has not flown over @entity11 airspace for quite some time because of the conflict between the government and rebel forces			1
--- the @entity6 take : do n't believe what you read on the internet rebel leader @entity165 has maintained for days that @entity166 was shot down , just not by his forces			1
he said they do n't have that capability			0
asked about the trail of evidence that contradicted him , @entity165 just rolled his eyes			2
" it 's very easy to refute it , " @entity165 told @entity0 's @entity174			2
" almost all information that comes over the internet is practically all lies			0
" the world 's take : @entity180 and @entity11 intelligence say the rebels did have the means to bring down a jetliner			1
they were in control of a @entity6 missile system that once belonged to the @entity11 military			1
a video reportedly showed the weapons system being carted out of eastern @entity11 into @entity6			1
intercepted conversations brag of an aircraft being shot down before the debris showed it was a civilian aircraft			2
a tweet from a rebel defense minister also bragged of the accomplishment -- before it was deleted			2
--- the @entity6 take : did we mention it was the @entity11 ? with the stakes so high even basic information online was being changed to shape facts			1
the @entity202 site @ @entity203 automatically tracks changes made by @entity6 government sites to @entity206			0
it has tracked dozens of edits from @entity31 to @entity206 entries about @entity8			1
in one case , one edit that said the plane was shot down by the @entity10 rebels was changed less than an hour later by someone inside the @entity6 government to say : " the plane was shot down by @entity11 soldiers			1
" the world 's take : the @entity206 entry now says the two sides are accusing each other			2
--- the @entity6 take : at first , the story did n't require such heavy media coverage			0
@entity6 newspapers downplayed the story just after the crash			0
the world 's take : the downing of the @entity88 made headlines instantly around the world			2
" the @entity229 or the people that control the information , networks in @entity6 , decide how they are going to explain something , what the general narrative will be , and that is given to radio , tv , newspapers to a certain extent , etc. , " said @entity56			0
" they essentially are told , this is what you should say			0
" it proved too much for one reporter , @entity153 's @entity246 , who quit the network last week			2
" i 've had many times over the five years i 've been at rt where i had a similar struggle and you 've watched the story handled in that way			0
and you felt very strongly that right away the narrative is being pitched -- a very specific narrative to the detriment to the facts and accuracy in reporting			0
" @entity0 's @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			2
