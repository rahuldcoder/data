-- after you 've had a major showdown between good and evil , killed off a major character and broken ratings records , what do you do for an encore ? that 's one big question on the minds of the legions of fans of " @entity13 " going into the fourth season premiere on sunday			1
last season , the show ranked as the no. 1 scripted show on television , a first for cable , and certainly something no one would have predicted for a series about a zombie apocalypse			1
the show returns with new showrunner @entity24 and without the latest victims of the walkers : @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
( there 's also the promise of a spinoff set in a different location during the apocalypse , due to arrive in 2015			2
) executive producer @entity35 spoke to @entity0 about what to expect this season			1
@entity0 : after all of the events of last season , where do we find our survivors now ? @entity35 : the survivors have essentially taken residence in the prison and realized that , at the moment anyway , that is the safest haven			1
they need to integrate new members			0
@entity0 : and where is @entity51 's head at now ? @entity35 : as we like to say , @entity51 spent a little time in " @entity53 " last season			1
but he 's always someone who will step up if necessary			2
this season , he 's in a very different place			1
he realizes that perhaps the most important role in the zombie apocalypse is that of a good father			0
he needs to raise @entity60 not to be a trigger - happy child soldier , and his baby , @entity62 , he 's taking that responsibility very seriously			2
@entity0 : last we saw the governor , he massacred many of his followers from @entity68 and drove off to parts unknown with a few loyalists			0
will we find out what became of him ? @entity35 : we definitely get a sense that he is out there			1
no one has forgotten and forgiven what he 's done			2
some people have moved on			0
as to what he 's up to , as the season develops , we 'll certainly get some insights into that			1
i ca n't say when we 'll find out , but we 'll find out			0
the governor is pretty formidable			0
we know he 's out there , and he 's not one to give up a grudge			2
@entity0 : with a good number of the original main characters deceased , we 're seeing the possibilities of new characters emerging , like the @entity68 survivors now living in the prison			0
@entity35 : some of the people are already significant characters in the comic book , people like @entity96			1
we did n't have enough bandwidth last season to spend much time getting to know him			2
now we have the time to do that			0
we will also explore those who used to live in @entity68			0
@entity0 : will we learn new things about the nature of the walkers ? @entity35 : what has n't changed is they have n't developed into super-fast walkers			1
we have very much the same rules for them , but some of them are more desiccated than ever			0
they 're more ravenous than ever , and there are a lot more of them			0
we 'll get to see how that plays out very quickly			0
@entity0 : what is showrunner @entity24 bringing to the new season ? @entity35 : @entity24 has been in the writers ' room since season two			1
so he 's someone who is very deep into the show			1
he was a fan of the comic book from the time it came out , and it 's celebrating its 10th anniversary			0
what he focuses on incredibly well is the juxtaposition between the epic scope of a zombie apocalypse -- which people will see very quickly in the first episode of the new season -- and making sure that with our characters this season , we 'll see how they handle escalating threats , as well as what decisions they make , both for themselves , the people they love and their allegiance to the group			0
@entity0 : of course , there are a few characters in particular that hold a lot of interest for the fans			0
what 's the status of @entity156 and @entity157 's relationship ? @entity35 : they 're the example of love among the ruins			1
as long as love exists , there 's hope			0
we 'll see if their relationship strengthens in times of calm , or is it strongest in times of crisis ? do they see the world from the same perspective or will different outlooks create conflict between them ? @entity0 : and of course , @entity180 's following has taken on a life of its own			1
will @entity180 fans be satisfied this season ? @entity35 : there 's no question			1
@entity180 , as brought to life by @entity188 , is someone who -- i think all of us have encountered characters with a dark , brutal past who seem to be broken			2
we want to see them be able to interact and communicate with other people , and we 'll see if this is possible with @entity180 .			2
