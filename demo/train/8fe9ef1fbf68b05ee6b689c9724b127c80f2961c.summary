@entity0 , @entity1 -- " relegation " is a word that is laced with horror for many football fans in @entity7 and @entity8 nations -- yet for others it remains a complete mystery			1
@entity13 - @entity12 fans show their support as the club was relegated from the @entity16 on sunday the latest victim of the relegation sword is @entity16 team @entity12			2
after a 2 - 0 loss to @entity20 on sunday , @entity12 faces a drop to the division below			0
promotion / relegation systems similar to the @entity16 's model work in many football leagues around the world , and have allowed dreams to come true for many aspirants , while they have also crushed the hopes and futures of others on the decline			1
while these systems have been long - running in @entity7 ; in the @entity35 -- the home of the meritocracy -- there is still no promotion or relegation to or from the top - flight @entity40 ( @entity40 ) competition			1
this is the case for the many sports in the @entity35 , as well as competitions in @entity45 and @entity46			1
for those who have not experienced promotion / relegation systems , they can appear slightly confusing			1
for people who do know of the concept , you may be unaware there are multiple different models operating in the world 's top leagues			2
the basic principle of the system is to transfer teams between divisions based on merit -- in order to allow fluidity between the amateur leagues and the very top of the professional game			1
do you think promotion / relegation systems are a good or bad idea ? share your thoughts in the @entity71 box below			1
in @entity1 's @entity16 , for example , at the end of each season when competition points have been accrued , the three bottom - ranked teams will be relegated ( demoted ) to the level below ( in @entity1 's case the second - tier @entity79 )			0
meanwhile , the top teams from the @entity79 will be promoted up to the @entity16 to fill the places of the relegated sides			0
this promotion system has two aspects			0
the top two teams are automatically promoted , while the third - to - sixth placed sides play - off for the third promotion spot			1
in @entity91 's @entity90 and @entity92 in @entity93 the system is simpler with the bottom three and top three teams automatically relegated and promoted respectively			0
@entity96 's @entity95 has two teams going up and down , with a play - off match between the third - bottom and third - top team from the first and second divisions			1
@entity103 's @entity102 has a similar structure to @entity1 , however , if the third - placed team in the second - tier has a ten point or greater gap on their nearest rival , then they automatically go up			0
so , why do n't the @entity35 have such a system ? according to @entity40 commissioner @entity112 the competition currently lacks the size and power to take on promotion / relegation			1
" unfortunately our country does not have the infrastructure to support promotion / relegation at this time			2
we 'll continue to monitor this , but it will likely be at least 10 years before promotion / relegation could be considered , " @entity112 said in a response to the question on the @entity40 web site			2
many of the clubs in the @entity128 ( which is the next competition below the @entity40 ) , lack the same fan - base and infrastructure that @entity40 clubs possess			0
for the relegated @entity12 side which faces next season in the second - tier competition , their plight does n't necessarily mean complete club failure			0
@entity138 , partner in the sport business group at accountancy firm @entity140 , told @entity2 that relegated @entity16 clubs received a " parachute payment " of $ 18 million ( Â£ 12m ) for each of the next two seasons -- which in many cases was enough to help them bounce back up to the top - tier			0
@entity138 said the relegation certainly did n't condemn them to financial failure either			2
" @entity12 consistently post one of the healthiest operating profits in @entity1 football , " he said .			0

promotion / relegation systems are used in football leagues around the globe
the *method* transfers teams between divisions depending on *performance*
