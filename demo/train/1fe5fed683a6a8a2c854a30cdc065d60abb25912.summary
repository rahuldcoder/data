-- as long as there are postmen , life will have zest			2
so said philosopher @entity5 , though younger generations may question the need for snail mail at all			2
but @entity9 , for one , is grateful to postmen , who over the years have dropped thousands of envelopes into the mailbox of his cramped apartment in the @entity16 neighborhood of @entity17 , where he has spent all his life			1
in that box came words and photographs from the famous -- and sometimes the infamous			2
now , in his closet , he has three jackets hanging , lonely among the 60 photo albums stacked up from the floor and on the shelf			2
" @entity30 " contains @entity29			2
" @entity38 presidents " includes @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , who started @entity9 on his unusual hobby			1
then there 's the @entity41 album , a veritable assortment of dictators , fallen and felled			2
among the likes of @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 is @entity48 , whose ignoble death last month earned @entity9 himself a bit of instant fame			1
@entity9 's collection -- he says he has more than 6,000 letters and autographed photos -- had been written about before , but after @entity48 died , everyone became curious about why an 81 - year - old @entity38 corresponded with the despot			1
to answer that question , @entity9 takes his questioners back to 1953 , when he was a young @entity60 private in @entity61			1
his buddy had a sole @entity64 card left and @entity9 decided he would send it to @entity35			1
" he wo n't reply to me , " @entity9 thought			1
" i 'm nobody special			2
" but his friend insisted he mail it			2
" what do you have to lose ? " he said			2
his friend thought wisely , it turns out			0
a month and a half later , came the response , on presidential stationery			0
if @entity35 can write back , why not others ? back in @entity75 , he married , had a daughter , and worked for 35 years designing floral arrangements first at a @entity79 shop , then closer to home in @entity17			1
when he saw someone in the news , he looked up the person 's address and dropped a letter in the mail			2
he was especially fond of politicians and world leaders			1
he wrote to @entity48 , then a young colonel who had usurped power in @entity91 in 1969 through a military coup			1
he asked for a signed photograph			0
" i found his name in the papers , " @entity9 says , sitting at a cluttered table surrounded by metal folding chairs			1
" i wished him well			0
" he got his photo and a letter that said : " your kind message to col. @entity48 , leader of the great first september revolution , has been received with great appreciation			1
" @entity9 , a devout jew , even received a @entity64 card from the @entity107			1
@entity48 wrote several times more ; one letter attacked @entity30 for practicing terrorism with its support of @entity111 -- not what a @entity113 man who also had letters from @entity111 's @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 would want to read			1
" @entity30 practices terrorism against the @entity121 people through providing @entity111 with the planes and weapons for attacking the @entity121 camps			0
@entity30 's countering of those people 's struggle is a crime against humanity and liberty , " @entity48 wrote			1
@entity9 put the typewritten words into the album , alongside photos of @entity48 , autographed in red ink			1
but he stopped writing to @entity48 , he says , after the 1988 bombing over @entity136 , @entity137			1
" they were shooting down a plane killing innocent people , " he says			0
he did n't want to be " mixed up with individuals who were committing crimes against humanity			0
" after the @entity91 uprising was well under way , @entity9 felt an urge to write again			1
" if you do n't do the right thing for your people and for your country , eventually your people will turn against you , " he told the dictator			0
the letter was returned to him , unopened			0
" he should have stepped down like the president of @entity156 , " @entity9 says			1
" maybe he would be alive today			0
but power , it 's not that easy to give it up			2
" if @entity9 's correspondence has intrigued the public , it has certainly raised eyebrows in the halls of intelligence			1
he says he 's been visited by the @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 a number of times			2
they told him his name keeps popping up in @entity173			0
they wanted to know what his connection was to some of these men , considered enemies of @entity30			0
@entity9 explained it was no big deal			1
that he just wanted to write to them and maybe get a photo to hang on his otherwise drab walls			0
" you look like a clean - cut fellow , " a @entity166 agent once told him			0
" it 's a hell of a hobby you have , @entity9			1
" @entity9 has sold only a few of his prized possessions			1
two letters from @entity192 fetched $ 500			2
a @entity64 card from @entity194 and @entity195 , $ 50			0
someone once offered him $ 35,000 for the whole collection			0
he wanted to pay him $ 10,000 up front and the rest after an auction			0
the problem was the advance was a personal check			0
@entity9 was n't going to take that chance			1
cash only , he says			0
three years ago , a guy from @entity17 offered him a dollar for each piece he owned			1
" you must be sick , " @entity9 told him			1
" and i am even sicker dealing with you			0
" @entity9 has no idea what his collection is worth , but he knew when he was getting ripped off			1
he 's thankful for his daughter and grandchildren			2
they are sure to take good care of his treasure trove after he is gone			0
lately , he has n't been writing as much			0
his hand gives way , he says			0
tough to keep it all going at his age			0
he does n't know why reporters called on him so much , though he certainly enjoys showing off his stuff			0
" i 'm nobody special , " he says			0
" i just want to be a part of history			0
" an ordinary guy with an extraordinary collection .			0

@entity9 likes to correspond with world leaders
among them were @entity31 , @entity45 and @entity48
@entity48 's death cast the spotlight on @entity9
he has over 6,000 letters and autographed photos in his @entity17 apartment
