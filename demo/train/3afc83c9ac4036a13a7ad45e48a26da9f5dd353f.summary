@entity0 , @entity1 -- prosecutors can play tapes of 911 calls made by @entity1 murder suspect @entity8 's mother after she learned her granddaughter was missing , a judge ruled thursday			1
@entity12 's mother , @entity8 , admitted during a hearing thursday in @entity0 that she had made exaggerated accusations about her daughter in those calls in a bid to get police to her home			1
but circuit judge @entity20 ruled that @entity8 was trying to use calls to police as a " ploy " to get her daughter to tell her what she knew about the missing 2 - year - old @entity8			1
defense lawyers sought to have thrown out of court as hearsay , but @entity20 found the tapes were not being used to prove the facts of the case			1
" whether they are true or false really has no bearing , " @entity20 said			0
" they were designed to elicit statements from the defendant in this case , to ascertain the whereabouts of the victim in this particular case			2
" @entity8 is charged with capital murder in the 2008 death of her 2 - year - old daughter @entity8 's death			0
the girl was reported missing two years ago thursday , and defense attorneys were trying to keep recordings of her mother @entity48 's three 911 calls out of evidence			1
facing her daughter in an @entity0 courtroom , @entity8 said she told police " whatever i was thinking at the time to get them out there " -- including the claim , made in her first of three 911 calls , that her daughter had stolen a car from her			1
" i wanted to speak to a police officer , " @entity8 said			2
" and i did n't think that if i said that she would n't take me to see my granddaughter , that they thought her and i might just be having an argument and think that i was some crazy grandmother and not come out and talk to me			1
" but she testified that she was in a panic after @entity8 told her that she had n't seen her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity8 , in a month			2
@entity8 told police her daughter had stolen money from her and that she had asked @entity8 to return her car to her brother @entity71 , from whom she had purchased the @entity72 but never finished paying			2
she said she did not intend to mislead police with the calls , however			1
and by the third call , she told investigators that her daughter 's vehicle smelled " like there 's been a dead body in the damn car			0
" and @entity12 testified thursday that he tried to get more information out of his sister while their " frantic " mother yelled at her			1
" she was very angry , " he said			0
" her first reaction was she had a clenched fist and hit the bed my sister was sitting on and said , ' what did you do ? we could have found her 31 days ago			0
' " @entity8 's skeletal remains were found in the woods about a quarter mile from the @entity97 in december 2008			0
prosecutors say they plan to show @entity8 lied repeatedly about her daughter 's fate , and that the 911 calls are a critical part of that progression			1
the @entity12 family had not seen the toddler or her mother since june 16 , 2008			1
when @entity8 found her daughter a month later , @entity8 was n't with her			2
@entity8 threatened to call the police , hoping it would force @entity8 to say where her daughter was			2
after two calls to the police , @entity8 admitted to her brother that she had not seen @entity8 in 31 days and that she believed her daughter was with a nanny , @entity113			1
the third and final call was placed immediately after @entity8 overheard what @entity8 told her brother			0
@entity8 seemed to be agitated and excited as she told the dispatcher that her granddaughter had been missing for a month			0
@entity8 has since said that the odor emanating from the car could have been from rotting garbage			0
however , forensic examiners have concluded that @entity8 's decomposing body was in the trunk of the car at some point in late june 2008			0
thursday 's hearing was also expected to focus on a motion from the defense			2
it will ask the judge to modify a ruling by judge @entity133 , who stepped aside in april			0
the motion concerns a review of documents from @entity136 , a private company that assisted in the search for then - missing @entity8			0
while @entity133 's order allowed the defense attorneys to review thousands of documents created by @entity136 , the attorneys were prohibited from taking notes during the review			1
the defense maintains the current arrangement is inefficient and it is seeking a more workable resolution			0
