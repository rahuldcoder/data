-- @entity2 , and @entity2 - @entity3 relations , confront their worst crises in recent memory			1
@entity2 's economy is in free fall , and its major cities are wracked by political violence , while @entity2 attitudes toward the @entity3 have never been worse -- a legacy of the @entity17 contractor who shot and killed two @entity2 in the city of @entity20 this year , the campaign of drone attacks in @entity2 's tribal regions and the unilateral @entity3 raid to kill @entity21 in northern @entity2 in may			1
on the @entity3 side , there is considerable anger about @entity2 's unwillingness or inability to constrain @entity28 groups based on its territory that are killing @entity3 soldiers in @entity31 and a perception that while @entity3 aid flows in large amounts to @entity2 , it continues to harbor enemies of @entity3			1
as a result , the rupture in the @entity3 - @entity2 relationship may be the most serious ever			1
some members of @entity40 are calling for the freezing of @entity3 aid to @entity2 , while the @entity2 government has demanded that @entity45 troops who have been training elements of its armed forces return home			1
a further rupture in relations between the two countries would mean placing crippling constraints on @entity3 aid , ending dialogue and curtailing cooperation on attacking terrorists			2
@entity2 is the second most populous nation in the @entity59 world and is armed with nuclear weapons			2
the @entity3 can not allow such an important country and an ally of the past three decades to become an enemy			0
in fact , the two nations have many interests in common			0
the @entity3 counterterrorism program in @entity69 would be crippled without @entity2 's help			1
and fostering a stable and prosperous @entity2 would reduce the risks of a nuclear confrontation between @entity73 and @entity2 , which has been a central goal of @entity3 statecraft since the late 1990s			1
even many who support the relationship , from @entity79 columnist @entity78 to members of @entity40 , have suggested the need for a partial separation , a cooling - off period or a more distant stance			1
sens. @entity85 and @entity87 , while encouraging a renewal of ties , reflected widespread official opinion when they called for steps to re-evaluate the relationship			0
the general consensus in @entity97 , in fact , though not endorsing more extreme calls for an outright divorce , appears to hold that the only realistic strategy for rebuilding @entity3 - @entity2 relations is gradual , long - term and qualified			1
such an argument is hardly unreasonable , given the mutual antagonism and distrust that exists today			0
yet we do not agree			0
waiting on events , we fear , could invite new crises and a more fundamental break in the relationship			0
instead , we propose a new basis for a revised yet lasting @entity3 - @entity2 partnership : a collaborative agenda for @entity2 to take its place as a major power in a modernizing @entity69			1
this concept , which we developed together with a study group of @entity2 economists , journalists and former government officials as well as their @entity3 counterparts with considerable experience in @entity2 , calls for actions within @entity2 to build the social , political and economic basis for this vision , as well as a @entity3 commitment to support this agenda with critical actions -- on trade , peacemaking and technical support			1
one important step would be a shift from a relationship in which the @entity3 sends aid to @entity2 to one in which the emphasis is on trade that benefits both sides			1
textiles constitute 60 % of @entity2 exports , half its manufacturing output and a third of its industrial employment			0
yet @entity2 textiles make up less than 4 % of @entity3 textile imports			1
we recommend a new effort to reduce the disproportionately high @entity3 tariffs on @entity2 textiles — as well as parallel programs to enhance @entity3 and international foreign direct investment in a range of @entity2 industries — as an alternative to most @entity3 civilian aid , which theoretically could amount to as much as $ 1.5 billion a year if all the aid available to @entity2 was actually disbursed			1
efforts to lower taxes on @entity2 textiles have foundered in the past because of opposition in @entity40 and from @entity3 manufacturers , but if this effort was tied to reduced @entity3 aid , it might have a better chance of being implemented			1
on security matters , extremism and terrorism threaten both nations			0
yet there is a tendency for both sides to operate in secret , from @entity2 support for militant groups who are killing @entity3 soldiers in @entity31 to @entity3 covert operations in @entity2 and drone strikes in the @entity2 tribal regions			1
this only sets the stage for public outrage when secret activities are revealed without being grounded in the fundamental strategic justification , the shared threat that warrants working together			0
so the time has come for the two governments to move toward joint , sustainable actions — against terrorism , militancy and insurgency — that can be agreed upon and defended in the public sphere			0
@entity2 concerns about civilian casualties and infringements of their national sovereignty caused by @entity3 drones could be addressed with a more transparent drone program , perhaps involving the public release of some drone video footage , as well as more public explication about why certain individuals have been targeted by drones			1
all done more clearly under @entity2 government guidance			0
after all , the war against the militants in the tribal regions is @entity2 's more than @entity3 's , and polling in those regions indicates that if the @entity2 military were seen as more directly responsible for the drone program , opposition to it would subside dramatically			2
@entity2 must also get its own house in order			0
economic growth has fallen to less than 3 % , and inflation has run in double digits for years , reaching a peak of over 20 % in 2008 - 09 , while @entity2 has one of the lowest tax - to - gdp ratios in the world , with less than 2 % of the population paying income tax			2
@entity2 needs to make good on long - delayed tax reform that would boost state revenues and to pursue steps to improve the climate for foreign investment			2
the motivation for @entity2 to do that is the parlous state of its economy ; if it maintains a 3 % growth rate , given its high birth rate , the economic conditions of the @entity2 people , which are already bad , will steadily worsen			0
we also recommend initiatives to accelerate trade throughout @entity69			0
improved trade with @entity73 represents a natural source of potential growth for @entity2 and a way to ease tensions between the two states			2
just as after @entity243 former enemies @entity241 and @entity244 created the coal and steel common market that spawned the @entity251 , the more @entity73 , @entity2 and other regional players collaborate along economic lines , the more troubling political issues will be seen as nuisances in the way of an emerging regional prosperity			0
a number of short - term initiatives could jump - start this process : allowing multiple - entry visas for businesspeople , easing restrictions on direct shipping and on rail and air links , and allowing @entity73 and @entity2 banks to open branches in each other 's countries			2
this will take political will in @entity2 amongst its politicians and the military , which retains a veto over all matters relating to national security			0
@entity275 will also have to be exercised on the @entity3 side to sustain faith in a challenging but essential partnership with @entity2			2
the relationship has certainly had its bad patches , but it 's one that neither side can live without			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors .			0

@entity2 - @entity3 relations are at their lowest ebb , authors say
some argue that there needs to be a cooling - off period to calm *tempers*
authors : both nations should craft a new plan to change the game
joint *anti-terror* operations and new trade *policies* would help , they say
