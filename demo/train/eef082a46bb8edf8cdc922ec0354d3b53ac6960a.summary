it 's got what many believe is the greatest club football team ever assembled -- @entity4			1
not to mention one of the planet 's greatest collections of art -- at the @entity9 in @entity10			1
then there 's the food , which we 've suggested is among the greatest cuisine in the world right now			1
what makes @entity17 such a cultural powerhouse ? size does n't hurt			1
it 's @entity21 's second - largest country ( after @entity22 ) in terms of area , and the world 's third - largest exporter of wine , fruits and vegetables			1
but it 's the incredible diversity of its people and passions that holds the key to understanding @entity17 's eternal appeal			1
more on @entity1 : " @entity36 : @entity37 " season two 1			2
there are many @entity39 during the grim decades of the fascist @entity45 's rule , regional languages such as @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 were banned in @entity17			1
on the dictator 's death in 1975 , a new , ultra-liberal constitution broke up @entity50 centralism by handing over sweeping autonomy to the 17 regions			1
the result was a reinvigorated sense of regional pride that had a ripple effect on every form of culture			2
that 's why street signs and menus sometimes come in unfamiliar dialects and languages such as @entity43 ( @entity64 ) , which closely resembles @entity65 ; @entity66 ( @entity67 ) ; @entity42 in @entity68 , the @entity69 and @entity70 ; and @entity41 ( possibly @entity21 's oldest language ) , which remains an unfathomable mystery of x 's , k 's and z 's			2
bulls are a unifying force despite the diversity , @entity17 has at least one common thread : bulls			1
the bull is @entity17 's iconic animal , and you wo n't miss seeing at least one -- alive , dead or fake			1
they famously thunder through the streets of @entity86 each july and snort and kick round the bull rings of @entity10 , @entity88 and countless smaller towns			2
they also appear on hilltops beside motorways and in a decades - old advertisement for @entity95 sherry			2
many a stuffed bull 's head watches over a bar interior , where aficionados might be glued to a televised bullfight and later scan a review of the fight in the arts , not sports , section of the newspaper			2
there are areas of resistance to what some see as a barbaric event			0
the popularity of the bloody contest is waning among the younger generation , and @entity68 has now banned the sport completely			0
spaniards do n't eat when you normally do lunch is from 2 p.m. onward , and dinner comes after 10 p.m. if you 're hungry in between or ca n't reset your body clock , there 's help -- tapas and pintxo bars ( pintxo is the @entity41 equivalent of tapas ) open around midday and again around 7 p.m. in some bars , a snack still comes free with a glass of beer , sherry or wine , but some places now charge			1
@entity137 is @entity17 's gourmet capital , not only for top restaurants but also pintxo bars			1
you can make a meal on exquisite miniature dishes and glasses of @entity144 ( a lightly sparkling dry white wine ) , @entity146 or cider			0
there 's coastline beyond the @entity150 on the @entity150 , tales of rampant overpricing and badly designed hotels conflict with the glam , moneyed image of @entity156			2
the eastern @entity158 coast is better known for low - cost tourism			0
but there are still unspoiled beaches where development and commercialism are largely absent			0
one of @entity17 's rare volcanic regions , @entity164 is a protected area in the southeast , where black - sand beaches sit beneath @entity169 watchtowers , monumental rocks and cactus - studded hills			1
in the southwest , the sandy beaches south of @entity173 are superb for windsurfing			0
in the north , attractive coves and fishing harbors edge the @entity179			0
it snows in the olive groves @entity182 is n't all shorts and t - shirts			2
in winter , snows falls at higher elevations , sometimes bringing a surreal vision of olive groves blanketed in white			0
the peninsula 's highest mountain range , the @entity189 is almost permanently snow - capped , creating the perfect scenic backdrop to the @entity193 , the famed @entity195 fortress and palace			2
in spring , wildflowers colonize the slopes , while in the valleys the last olives are harvested			0
more on @entity1 : best of @entity10 6			0
life is just a series of fiestas frenetic music , food , booze , dance and dressing up make saints ' festivals a highlight of the year in @entity17 , even in the tiniest of villages			1
the quirky @entity17 imagination -- @entity215 's movies exemplify it , as do @entity218 's paintings -- gives birth to the parade of grotesque papier mache figures in @entity70 's @entity223 festival and the giant annual tomato fight in the town of @entity226			1
seekers of peace and quiet might want to avoid @entity229 , in @entity230 , when 10,000 drummers play for several days			0
those of a nervous disposition might steer clear of @entity234 , in @entity64 , when survivors of near - death experiences parade through the tiny village in open - top coffins			0
when wild horses are corralled in @entity242 , wine flows all night during @entity146 's grape harvest or flamenco singers carouse into the early hours during @entity88 's @entity245 , you know you can only be in @entity17			1
under many a church lurks a mosque bell towers crowning @entity17 's churches and cathedrals may appear catholic , but if you look closely you might discern the form of a minaret , especially in places such as @entity88 and @entity256			1
@entity258 's convoluted history brought a succession of invaders and religions , meaning many places of worship were rebuilt using the stones and structures of their predecessors			2
@entity268 temples lie deep below , later overlaid by churches , then @entity271 mosques and , finally , after the total reconquest of the peninsula in 1492 , @entity273 churches again			0
the ultimate symbol is @entity256 's eighth - century @entity277 , one of the largest mosques in the world , with a cathedral parachuted into its heart			2
@entity283 is more important than @entity284 @entity285 ( @entity286 ) is easily more important than @entity284 in @entity17			1
the whole country shuts down for four days from @entity288 at 1 p.m. , a rare example of punctuality			1
day and night , swaying processions of impassioned penitents in tall hoods and flowing robes advance to a hypnotic drumbeat , carrying crucifixes and weighty life - size statues of agonizing @entity299 figures and weeping virgins on pasos ( floats ) , while flickering torchlight adds to the electric atmosphere			0
@entity182 pageants are more animated , with stirring saetas -- spontaneous wails of passion			0
in the north , although the pattern of parish brotherhoods is similar , the atmosphere is more solemn			0
there are many layers of ham ham scams have become so widespread in @entity17 that recent legislation introduced new definitions for ham quality			1
@entity320 is a gastro - passion throughout @entity17 , inspiring fierce rivalry between producers			1
the most velvety , expensive and sought after variety is jamon @entity327 , from acorn - fed , indigenous black pigs reared in four specific regions : the @entity331 mountains , in western @entity182 ; @entity332 ; @entity333 , near @entity334 , and @entity335 , north of @entity256			0
at the bottom of the table is jamon serrano , produced industrially from white pigs yet still palatable			0
@entity68 may not be part of @entity17 much longer catalans speak another language , have their own flag , are fanatical about cured sausages , nurtured the showman - chef @entity345 ( of late @entity347 ) , build acrobatic people - pyramids and , traditionally , dance rather slowly			1
they 're gunning for independence from @entity17 , with a referendum in the cards for 2014			1
what they 're good at is architecture , art and food -- elements that combine with dazzling grace in @entity4			0
you can stay in monasteries -- without taking vows back in 1928 , the @entity17 government decided to rescue its crumbling monuments by converting them into grand hotels , or paradors			1
these castles , monasteries or palaces in atmospheric old towns or tranquil rural spots soon acquired conquistador - style interiors and a faithful clientele -- there are now 93 throughout the country			2
the pick of the bunch may be the @entity380 , in @entity381 -- it started life in 1499 as a hostel - turned - hospital for exhausted and sick pilgrims after their 500 - mile walk from the @entity386			0
the pilgrims ' goal was the spectacular cathedral next door , allegedly home to the relics of @entity392			0
beware of loud clanging bells			0
@entity394 is the author of " new tapas , " " @entity395 " and " @entity396			0
" she blogs at @entity397 .			0

people *typically* do n't eat dinner in @entity17 until after 10 p.m.
it 's hard to keep up with all the fiestas throughout the country
@entity17 has at least one common thread : bulls
catalans yearn for independence from @entity17
