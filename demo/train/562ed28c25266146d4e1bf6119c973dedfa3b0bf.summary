@entity0 , @entity1 -- we halfway expect the four members of @entity5 to roll into @entity6 drunk and brawling , a burly tour manager leading them in by the scruff of their necks			1
@entity5 is a family affair , consisting of three brothers and their cousin			1
instead , a uniformed valet ushers them in , one by one , offering each a flute of champagne -- which @entity5 , the singer , and @entity5 , the drummer , politely accept			1
" we have a bunch of rooms at the hotel , and the valet came with the floor , " they explain , shaking their heads in amazement			1
the hipster lounge we 've gathered in is in the lobby of the @entity32 in @entity0 , @entity1			1
a framed black - and - white photo of the @entity5 hangs in a spot of honor : closest to the bar			1
it 's autographed , with a inscription that reads , " @entity39 ! " @entity5 's fourth album , " @entity41 , " has sold 5 million copies worldwide and spun off three hit singles , catapulting the group into that elite fraternity of bona fide rock bands that enjoy airplay on both pop and rock stations			1
these days , the @entity50 four -- brothers @entity51 , @entity53 and @entity54 , along with their cousin , @entity55 -- are fulfilling the promise that so many critics predicted early in their career			1
their majestic , tension - filled brand of @entity61 garage rock has its roots in , of all things , the church			1
the brothers ' dad , @entity65 , was a traveling @entity67 preacher who led raucous , revivalist - style congregations			1
both he and his father went by the name @entity71			1
his boys have carried on in his road warrior tradition			1
the stage is their pulpit , their congregation , 20,000 - seat arenas			2
the following is an edited version of our interview			2
@entity2 : it 's been a great couple of years for you			2
do you feel your lives have changed ? @entity5 : absolutely			1
it 's just a strange thing for us , because we 've had success in the past , but a great majority of it has n't been in @entity90			1
and when it starts to happen in @entity90 , you turn into a wild person again			2
" oh , let 's party ! " @entity2 : is it really true that you guys can consume more alcohol than any other band out there on the road ? @entity5 : collectively , it 's a possibility			1
@entity51 : i mean , we can consume more alcohol than any other popular band that actually works			1
as soon as we say " thank you " and " good night , " that means it 's time for us to have fun			2
we 're sober in the mornings			2
@entity2 : are you sober now ? @entity51 : yes			2
( laugh ) @entity2 : you guys are also famous for your fights			1
@entity116 had two of you at each other 's throats			2
a $ 7,000 mirror was apparently involved -- @entity51 : and we were so mad about what they said that we got into a big fight			2
nah , i 'm kidding			2
a lot of the stories that come out about us fighting absolutely are n't true			1
@entity2 : are all of you still in your 20s ? @entity53 : i cracked the 30s ! june 26th			2
@entity51 : we 're about to @entity132 his ass and get someone younger			2
@entity2 : you grew up with religion at the center of your life			2
how do you think it 's worked its way into what you do now and what we hear coming out of the stereo ? @entity51 : i grew up with my dad as a preacher , and so you hear @entity148 verses			0
i 've always looked at the @entity148 as poetry , so i kind of learned to write in that style from time to time			0
and a lot of people misconstrued that as me trying to push something on someone			0
( looks at @entity53 ) look at him drinking the devil 's grape juice			0
( the others chuckle ) @entity2 : you played music when you were growing up , but it was associated with the church			1
@entity53 : it was more like black gospel music , like @entity164 , @entity165 -- fun music to play			0
most people hear , " oh , you played in church , " and they picture an organ , and just very quiet			1
it was very lively and wild			0
@entity51 : the thing that inspired me about the music we grew on is that it was human music			0
the people that got up to play , they basically just got up there and told the story of what happened to them that day			0
@entity53 : it was like the blues			0
@entity51 : ( demonstrates by imitating a blues singer ) " today , i went to @entity189			0
i saw someone walking down the aisle , @entity191			0
" for me , it was inspiring			0
i thought , " man , i want to make up some songs			0
" @entity2 : on your current album , " only by the @entity199 , " your music has gotten bigger and more anthemic			0
can we attribute that to the time you 've spent hanging out with @entity203 ? @entity51 : we spent a big chunk as the opening band for @entity203 and @entity206 and @entity207 -- and when we walked out into these venues , let 's face it , there might have been 200 people in a 20,000 - seat venue			1
and so we would start playing our songs , and when we 'd play it , it would sound bigger than anything we 'd ever heard , because it was bouncing off the walls			1
so then we 'd start to soundcheck in all these big places , and the songs started to build			1
the next one could be raw and dirty and gritty and really small			0
we like to keep people guessing			0
@entity2 : how did your parents react to your saying , " hey , @entity224 , i want to be in a rock band			1
" @entity51 : they took it pretty well			0
they supported us pretty good			0
we had to lie our way through it a little bit			0
@entity55 's family did n't know he was actually going to be in the band			1
we told them he was going to spend the summer with us but -- @entity5 : @entity237 came home			1
@entity2 : right now , your dad is on the road with you , @entity55			0
@entity55 : yeah , he 's only out for a couple of shows			0
our family always comes to hang out			0
@entity2 : looks like you 'd better get him some sunscreen			0
he 's a little red			0
@entity51 : that 's not from sun. that 's actually from alcohol			0
he gets really red in the face after a long bender .			0
