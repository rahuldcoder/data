-- @entity3 is ready to host the @entity4 for the first time , the sport 's president @entity1 told @entity0			1
@entity3 became the first nation from the continent to stage football 's @entity8 last year , while @entity10 finished third in the bidding for the @entity12			1
the nine - day athletics showpiece lays claim to being the third biggest sporting event on the planet behind those two competitions , but requires significantly less investment in infrastructure for the host nation			1
" i think you could have a good bid from @entity3 in 2019 , 2021 , " said @entity21 chief @entity1 , who is from @entity22			1
" i think that there is a country and an @entity28 city that can organize it			0
" but you must plan the development of your city because in order to have all this investment , you need to have the facilities			0
" while a successful @entity37 bid , such as @entity38 , requires a large stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies alone , a world championships can be run on a smaller scale			1
it 's probably easy to do at @entity44 and not to build a new stadium , but they wanted to develop this area of @entity43			1
they can do that , " @entity1 said			1
" i think if you have a vision of development in your city , athletics can do that , the @entity37 can be the way			2
" the world championships are easier			1
you need a good stadium , good facilities -- they have these in many @entity28 countries , but you need the willingness of the government to say , ' i 'm going to put in $ 50 million			0
' " @entity43 has also won the right to host the 2017 world championships , beating a big - money bid from @entity66 which -- on top of the $ 8 million prize fund -- offered a reported $ 33 million in sponsorships of the @entity21 's competitions , awards dinners and development programs			1
the @entity74 capital made a late move by matching the prize purse , but @entity1 said concerns over the legacy of its new olympic stadium were forefront in the decision process			1
" i think they picked @entity43 because , as you know , we had a very big fight to have this stadium stay in @entity43 , " the 78 - year - old said			2
" it 's a pity that for the @entity37 , we build a stadium with 100,000 seats for an opening and closing ceremony and for athletics and , at the end , say , ' we 'll destroy it			2
' and certainly , i feel that @entity74 is a very great nation of athletics			2
" the bidding process for football 's 2018 and 2022 @entity98 , won by @entity100 and @entity66 , came under great scrutiny due to allegations of corruption against top officials at ruling body @entity105			2
@entity1 is also facing an @entity107 inquiry over claims that he received illegal payments from now defunct @entity111 company @entity110 , which had an exclusive marketing contract with the @entity21 for the world championships			1
" i think they discovered that i received money in 1993			0
in 1993 , something very difficult happened to me : my house was burned ( down )			0
they burned my house with all of my family inside , " said @entity1 , who has been @entity21 president since 1999 and was this year re-elected until 2015			1
" fortunately , no - one died , but i lost my house and i had no insurance , so i had to find a way to rent a house , find a way to build up my own house , buy something else			0
so many friends knew this and they said , ' we 'll send my support			0
' " i received this			0
when they asked me , i started by saying , ' this is what happened			0
' i did n't hear again from the ethical commission			0
" @entity1 , a former athlete who held the @entity137 / @entity28 long jump record from 1957 - 60 and is now an @entity107 member , said he is confident he will not be found guilty of wrongdoing when the @entity107 considers the case in december			1
there 's no problem , " he said			2
" and , to be clear , when i became president , the first thing that i decided is that @entity110 used to be our marketing company for the television rights in @entity148 , getting 50 % of the money			0
i decided that we did n't need @entity110 , i have to make a direct contract with someone else , and so i made a contract with someone else			0
" if the ethical commission says they want to meet me , i will go to them			0
if the executive board says , ' we want to meet , ' i will go to them and i will explain myself , but i do n't find myself guilty of any wrongdoing			0
