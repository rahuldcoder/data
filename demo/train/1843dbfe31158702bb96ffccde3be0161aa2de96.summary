-- " be not afraid " was the message of @entity3 's @entity2 it 's a message @entity6 conservatives need to take to heart again in the era of @entity9			1
from tv and radio come warnings that the unwise policies of the @entity9 administration threaten or doom the @entity6			1
we are treading the road to serfdom , it 's said			1
the brilliant @entity20 gave voice to these fears in a highly perceptive column a couple of weeks ago : " i see two central reasons for the @entity26 's rise			2
the first is the yardstick , and the second is the clock			2
imagine that over at the 36 - inch end you 've got pure liberal thinking -- more and larger government programs , a bigger government that costs more in the many ways that cost can be calculated			1
over at the other end you 've got conservative thinking -- a government that is growing smaller and less demanding and is less expensive			1
you assume that when the two major parties are negotiating bills in @entity43 , they sort of lay down the yardstick and begin negotiations at the 18 - inch line			2
each party pulls in the direction it wants , and the dominant party moves the government a few inches in their direction			1
" but if you look at the past half century or so you have to think : how come even when republicans are in charge , even when they 're dominant , government has always gotten larger and more expensive ? it 's always grown ! " @entity20 aptly describes the despair that many conservatives these days feel			1
the good news is this despair is wrong			2
the yardstick does not measure only one way , the ratchet does not always grip against us			2
in fact , the story of the past 50 years has been that the @entity6 economy has become freer and more dynamic			1
the federal government regulated the price of every airfare			1
it regulated every rail , truck and shipping route			2
it regulated the price of natural gas			2
it regulated stockbrokers ' commissions			2
it regulated the interest rates that could be paid on checking accounts			2
it told most farmers how much they could grow of what commodity			0
it regulated what kind of political and religious comment could be expressed on the airwaves			0
and of course it conscripted millions of young men beginning their careers into the armed forces			0
all of that is gone , gone , gone			0
true , in other ways society is more regulated than it used to be			0
there was no @entity100 back then , no @entity101			0
i think most @entity6 -- even most @entity103 members -- support the new environmental and antidiscrimination acts that have replaced the old regulation of transport , energy and financial pricing			1
but whether you support the new laws or oppose them , it 's just wrong to say we 're treading a one - way road to serfdom			0
yet @entity20 is exactly right in her assessment that this is what the @entity103 followers think : that we 're on a road of no return and that we 're running out of time to correct our ways			0
this is what @entity20 calls " the clock " : " it 's getting late			0
if we do n't get the size and cost of government in line now , we wo n't be able to			1
we 're teetering on the brink of some vast , dark new world - states and cities on the brink of bankruptcy , the federal government too			1
" anybody who has spent time with conservative - minded @entity6 can attest to the sense of foreboding and urgency reported by @entity20			1
it 's five minutes to midnight ; freedom is on the verge of permanent extinguishment			0
in these tough economic times , who will deny that there is much reason for foreboding ? yet conservatives sell our own accomplishments and principles short when they represent them as so fragile			1
the fact is : our win - loss ratio is actually pretty good			0
free - market ideas have rescued states in much worse trouble than @entity159 : @entity161 's @entity160 to name one outstanding example			0
i can see why an anticapitalist radical would want to insist that capitalism is fragile and ready to collapse			0
but why would an @entity6 conservative concede such a preposterous claim ? " @entity168 , " as @entity169 so powerfully said , " are conservative			1
" and as @entity170 said , paraphrasing @entity171 , " facts are stubborn things			0
" those facts will reassert themselves			0
and so will the strength , dynamism , and creativity of the @entity6 economy			1
yes , @entity6 have some urgent decisions to make			1
yes , the bad decisions of the @entity9 administration will be hard and painful to correct			0
no good decision was ever made in panic			0
assess the challenge without complacency , but also without exaggeration			0
think , organize and act			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			1

@entity192 : some conservatives *lament* @entity6 has moved *decisively* toward socialism
he says the reality is that the @entity6 is much freer today than in 1960
government control of the economy and of expression is much reduced , he says
@entity192 says the " strength , dynamism and creativity of the @entity6 economy " will prevail
