athlete , marathoner -- and now swimsuit model			0
@entity3 has appeared in @entity5 's famous swimsuit edition this year , becoming the latest tennis player to don a bikini in a shoot for the renown @entity10 publication			1
her pal , world no. 1 @entity11 , along with @entity12 and @entity13 , have featured in the swimsuit edition in the past and the @entity16 could n't wait to join them			1
so much so @entity3 approached the magazine , not vice versa			2
" it 's always been a dream of mine ( to be in the swimsuit issue ) , " @entity3 , a former no. 1 like @entity12 and @entity13 , told the for the win website monday in @entity21			1
" i went to the offices of @entity5 quite a few months ago and threw myself out there			2
' if you need a model or want one , i 'm here			0
' " it must have made a pretty good impression			0
" because i travel the world so much and play all over the place and spend so much time over here , the issue is a huge deal for me and my family			0
i think because i 'm in it this year , @entity38 is going crazy about it this year and that 's fun to see			0
" @entity3 posted pictures of the shoot on @entity44 -- and one of her other friends on the tour , @entity48 , was impressed , calling the photos " stunning			1
" the magazine hit the newsstands this week			0
@entity48 dumped the @entity16 out of the @entity51 -- this season 's first grand slam -- in straight sets in the second round			1
while @entity3 waits for her first grand slam title , her inclusion in the swimsuit edition is likely to do no harm to her off court profile			1
last september she did reach the @entity62 final in @entity21 -- losing to @entity11 -- and returned to the @entity63 a few months later to take part in the @entity65 .			2
