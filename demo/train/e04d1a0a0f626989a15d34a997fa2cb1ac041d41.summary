@entity15 said thursday that it had been aware from the outset that director @entity28 's modern production of @entity6 's " tannhauser " was " absolutely likely to arouse controversy			1
" but , it said , the effects had gone beyond controversy , with " some scenes , especially the firing - squad sequence , which was staged with drastically realistic force " apparently proving an " intolerable burden for numerous members of the audience , " both mentally and physically			1
as a result " they were subsequently obliged to undergo medical treatment , " it said			0
after due consideration , the opera house said , " we have come to the conclusion that we can not permit ourselves to undertake further responsibility for such an extreme effect caused by our artistic endeavors			1
" @entity2 newspaper @entity49 said in its english - language version that the production depicted " the character @entity54 as a @entity20 war criminal and it even included a gas chamber on stage			1
" in what was a particularly shocking scene , it said , " nude actors are lowered to the floor on a cross made of glass cubes that are slowly filled with fog to represent the gas chambers			2
