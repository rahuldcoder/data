-- thirty years ago wednesday , @entity2 student revolutionaries climbed over the walls of the @entity4 in @entity5 and seized dozens of @entity6 , whom they ultimately held hostage for 444 days			1
the hostage crisis , coming in the aftermath of @entity2 's @entity11 revolution , ended diplomatic relations between @entity13 and @entity5 -- a rift that persists to this day			1
@entity2 celebrates the embassy takeover as an official holiday , and tens of thousands showed up in @entity5 on wednesday to hear anti-american speeches			1
the anniversary was also an opportunity to reignite the anti-government protests that were sparked in june , following a disputed presidential election , and thousands of anti-government protesters ignored warnings from @entity2 authorities to stay home			1
one of the leaders of the 1979 hostage - takers says the @entity6 and @entity2 must not be hostages to history			1
" i am not willing to be a hostage of that historical event , " @entity31 said on @entity0 's " @entity32 , " in an interview marking the anniversary			1
" neither @entity2 nor the @entity6 should be hijacked by that historical event , " he said from @entity5 , where he went on to become a reformist lawmaker and was himself jailed by the @entity11 regime			1
he said the two sides need to be aware of the past without being imprisoned by it			2
" if they do not pay attention to ... history they will have an unstable future , an impermanent future , " he said			0
@entity31 said he and his fellow students had been offended that @entity48 , then the @entity6 president , had let the deposed @entity50 into the @entity6 for medical treatment -- and said the actions of his compatriots had parallels in the @entity6			1
" we felt insulted -- our revolution , our people -- and so there was a rebellion , " he said through a translator			2
" a measure was needed to be taken that was effective , that could impact the world public opinion			0
" we were not radical students			0
we were revolutionary students , in the sense that we were defending our country , our people , our nation , " he said			1
" what the students did for the first two or three days , it was a student activity			0
it was meant to protest , something that @entity6 students did many times on the streets to protest the @entity79			1
" but @entity80 , a former @entity6 hostage , is not convinced by the comparison			1
" whatever they thought they were doing , whether it was a 1970s - style student sit - in , the results of it were very ... different , " he told @entity86			1
and it was not the @entity6 hostages who suffered most , he added			2
" they brought misery to the @entity2 people			1
what happened to us was difficult			0
it was -- it was uncomfortable			0
but it lasted 14 months and was over , " he said			0
" we certainly did n't expect it to last that long			0
they have said they did n't expect [ it ] to last that long			0
but what they did , in effect , was to create a climate of lawlessness and mob rule [ of which ] they and their compatriots are today the greatest victims , " said @entity80 , the author of " negotiating with @entity2 , wrestling the ghost of @entity108			2
" the hostage crisis escalated beyond what any of the participants expected as @entity2 's new revolutionary government publicly backed the hostage - takers , @entity31 and former @entity48 aide @entity122 agree			1
" that way it became actually an act of the @entity2 government , rather than a group of students who were acting potentially outside the law , " said @entity122 , who was @entity48 's point man on @entity2			1
" so basically , the situation got out of hand , in terms of being a student activity , " @entity31 said			0
" it became a societal issue backed by the leadership			0
" and every day that passed on , things got more complicated			0
the analysis got more complicated in the @entity140			0
they did n't know what to do			0
and they faced a challenge by the @entity2 revolution and this revolutionary thought			2
and it reached a point where nobody felt prepared to deal with it , " the former student revolutionary said			0
" and so after a while , both @entity6 and @entity2 were looking for a solution , because both their hands were tied at that stage , but the solution needed to be such that no country would be seen as the loser , " he said			1
that impasse still dominates the wary relationship between @entity5 and @entity13 , @entity86 's guests said			2
but it is time to call in the @entity166 , @entity80 said , referring to the popular movie that came out not long after the @entity6 were finally released			2
" you know , they put the ghosts in the can and put the can away			0
and somehow ... you 've got to do that , " he said			0
" you do n't forget them			0
you do n't necessarily even ask for an apology			0
but you look them in the face , you know them for what they are , which is a very ugly and negative act , and then you put them in their proper compartment , " he advised			0
but @entity122 , now a @entity188 professor , said the hostage crisis continues to have ramifications in @entity13 today			1
" the hostage crisis was extended probably eight months beyond what it should have been			1
no matter how you look at it in terms of @entity2 's interests or what have you , they simply could n't make up their mind , " he said of the regime in @entity5			2
" and it has left the impression that , one , @entity2 ca n't be trusted ; two , that when they negotiate , they negotiate in bad faith ; and , three , that they are paying only attention to their own internal circumstances and ignoring everybody else			2
" that is a legacy that we live with and even people who do n't remember the hostage crisis at all still have that image of @entity2 that was created in those days that has not gone away , " he said .			1
