@entity0 -- @entity2 , often described as president @entity4 's brain , defended the former president in a new book against claims that he lied to the @entity9 public in order to invade @entity11 in 2003			1
" [ @entity12 ] id @entity4 lie us into war ? absolutely not , " @entity2 wrote in his 516 - page book , " @entity16 : my life as a @entity18 in the @entity19			1
" the book highlights @entity2 's life and career and his time working for @entity4			1
@entity2 , a long - time political advisor who joined @entity4 in the @entity24 after the 2000 campaign , said the @entity9 would n't have gone to war with @entity11 if the administration knew that weapons of mass destruction would n't be found			1
" would the @entity30 have occurred without wmd ? i doubt it , " he wrote			0
" @entity33 was very unlikely to have supported the use - of - force resolution without the threat of @entity31			2
the @entity4 administration itself would probably have sought other ways to constrain @entity39 , bring about regime change , and deal with @entity11 's horrendous human rights violations			2
" @entity11 leader @entity39 , @entity2 argued , may have destroyed most of his wmd stockpiles or possibly moved them to other countries such as @entity45 before the war			2
" but i am under no illusions ; the failure to find stockpiles of @entity31 did great damage to the administration 's credibility , " he wrote			2
" our weak response in defense of the president and in setting the record straight , is , i believe , one of the biggest mistakes of the @entity4 years			2
" he goes on to say , " so who was responsible for the failure to respond ? i was			0
i should have stepped forward , rung the warning bell , and pressed for full - scale response			0
" enhanced interrogation @entity2 discusses the @entity4 administration 's support for the controversial interrogation technique known as waterboarding , which @entity69 and others have described as torture			1
he defends the use of enhanced interrogation techniques ( eits ) , arguing they were authorized by the @entity76 in august 2002 and signed off by then - @entity78 director @entity77			1
he also disputes claims that the administration failed to brief members of @entity33 on the use of these techniques			2
" when these techniques were first authorized , @entity69 leaders had been briefed about them			0
their silence made them complicit in their use , " he wrote			0
" nonetheless , when political winds shifted and memories of 9/11 faded , some @entity69 leaders claimed that they had never been told about the techniques and that the @entity4 administration used eits only in secret			2
" he singled out @entity24 speaker @entity95 , @entity96 , who charged in july 2009 that the @entity78 misled @entity33 in a secret briefing she received in 2002			0
@entity95 said the @entity78 failed to inform her and others at the briefing about harsh interrogation techniques being used on terrorism suspects			1
the @entity78 responded by saying @entity95 was told about the harsh techniques , including waterboarding , at the classified 2002 briefing			0
as for whether the techniques were actually torture , @entity2 says the president " never authorized torture , " but rather " did just the opposite " by making sure the techniques " did not cross the legal line into torture			2
" " what 's more , eits did help our intelligence agents gather critical information to thwart future attacks , " he added			0
@entity117 @entity4 and his administration have been criticized for their response to @entity117 , which devastated much of the @entity121 in 2005			1
one incident @entity2 addresses in the book involves @entity4 flying over @entity124 in @entity125 rather than landing and surveying the damage			1
@entity2 says he was " one of the people responsible for this mistake , " and argued that the president should n't land in @entity129 in the immediate aftermath so as not to hinder relief efforts , but rather come back days later			2
@entity2 notes that while the decision did not help out @entity4 politically , it was the right thing to do so as not to take away vital resources that were needed for the relief effort			1
@entity138 @entity2 cites a particularly touchy subject that emerged during the 2000 presidential campaign : @entity4 's 1976 arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol			1
@entity2 said that while @entity4 told a few people about it , including himself , the governor did n't want it to be made public			1
the @entity138 disclosure , which came out shortly before @entity150 , was " suspicious , " @entity2 says			0
he points a finger at vice president @entity153 's campaign spokesman , @entity154 , as a possible source of the information getting out			0
" [ @entity158 ] e had our suspicions and they centered on @entity154 , " @entity2 writes			0
" he had been raised in @entity161 , was one of the @entity69 's best opposition researchers , had run the @entity165 campaign for @entity166 , worked on the @entity24 rapid - response team handling scandals during the @entity169 years , played around in @entity165 @entity69 politics ... " @entity171 as a running mate @entity171 , a defense secretary under president @entity173 and former @entity175 congressman , was tasked to help then - candidate @entity4 picking a running mate			1
some of the potential running mates that @entity4 and his campaign considered included former sen. @entity179 of @entity180 , former gov. @entity181 of @entity182 , along with sens. @entity183 of @entity184 and @entity185 of @entity186 , among others			0
but it would be @entity171 's name that would resonate with @entity4 at the time			1
@entity2 says the governor was " starting to feel that @entity171 was as good as any " to fill the role			1
" @entity4 had become impressed with @entity171 's thoroughness as head of the vp search and the intelligence and insights he offered in meetings ... @entity4 liked @entity171 's straightforward manner and his ability to question the fundamental premise of an argument , " @entity2 writes			1
@entity2 also confronts rumors in the book that @entity171 picked himself , saying that accusation is " far - fetched			1
" " i saw the man squirm as @entity4 pressed him to accept , " he wrote			0
@entity209 @entity2 writes that the low point for him personally during the @entity4 presidency was when reporters were camped out at his home and he faced a possible indictment over leaking @entity78 operative @entity209 's name to the media -- an accusation he denies in the book			1
upon finding out that prosecutor @entity219 was not likely to charge him , he says he " placed the receiver in its cradle and wept			0
" @entity223 @entity2 also wrote that he was most worried in the 2004 re-election campaign about then - sen. @entity223 , who unsuccessfully sought the @entity69 presidential nomination that year			0
" he was a fresh face , articulate and engaging , and attractive to the point of being almost too pretty , " @entity2 wrote			0
" he was a product of the @entity229 , which had helped @entity169 a dozen years before			0
" but @entity2 also charged that @entity223 was unprincipled , flip - flopped on issues and was somewhat vain			0
" @entity223 also seemed inordinately in love with his looks , his voice , with himself , " @entity2 said			0
@entity2 's memoir goes beyond the @entity4 years , his criticism of the media and @entity69			1
he also takes readers back to his childhood and opens up about how he dealt with his mother 's suicide .			0
