-- relax , you legions of @entity3			1
@entity6 did n't screw up the film version of @entity9 ' young - adult bestseller about a survival - of - the - fittest reality show that sends home all its teen contestants , save the victor , in body bags			1
the screen " @entity17 " radiates a hot , jumpy energy that 's irresistible			1
it has epic spectacle , yearning romance , suspense that wo n't quit and a shining star in @entity24 , who gives us a female warrior worth cheering			1
that 's more than you can say for the castration job that the suits did on @entity32 's " @entity33 " franchise			1
i 'll admit that " games " is n't the scary , eruptive firecracker of my dark , @entity38 - fueled imagination			2
and if you 're among the 26 million who devoured the @entity43 trilogy -- " @entity39 " followed by " @entity44 " and " @entity45 " -- you know it could have been			2
but even wearing a @entity48 harness to ensure profitability , " @entity39 " gets your pulse racing			2
it 's about something pertinent , the mission to define yourself in a world that 's spinning off its moral axis			2
as 16 - year - old @entity56 , the renegade hunter who kills with a bow and arrow and stands up to take the place of her younger sister in the deadly games , @entity55 reveals a physical and emotional grace that 's astonishing			1
give her the deed , because she owns this movie			2
it 's not just that @entity56 makes " @entity33 's " @entity66 look like the wimp she is , it 's that @entity55 , 21 , is an acting dynamo with the skills to let us into @entity56 ' searching mind			1
last year , @entity55 won an @entity73 nomination for playing an @entity75 girl in " @entity76			2
" she 's just as affecting this time , lending primal force to this dystopian fable of a society out of sync with human values			2
at 142 minutes , " @entity39 " can go from rushed to draggy			2
but director @entity83 ( " @entity84 , " " @entity85 " ) hits the high spots , using action to define character instead of obliterate it			2
he wisely brought in @entity43 to collaborate on the script he wrote with @entity90 ( " @entity91 " )			2
that way , even when the book 's events are condensed or characters eliminated , the feeling stays true			0
" @entity105 " are a punishment invented by the @entity98 of @entity99 ( read : @entity100 ) for the 12 districts whose rebellion against @entity98 rule was crushed more than 74 years ago			0
the attitude of president @entity107 ( @entity108 , wily in his evil ) is " you screwed us , so we 'll screw you			0
" every year on @entity113 , a boy and a girl ( ages 12 to 18 ) from each district are chosen by lottery to fight to the death in a televised gladiator event devised by head games - maker @entity121 ( @entity122 )			1
ratings are not a problem			0
even in downtrodden @entity98 , where @entity56 hunts for scraps to feed her sister and her widowed mother , viewing the @entity39 is mandatory			1
you wo n't need your arm twisted to see the movie , artfully shot by @entity131 ( " @entity132 " ) as the scene shifts from the perverse lushness of the @entity98 to the stark landscape of the battle zone			0
and did i mention makeovers ? all the @entity139 ( that 's what contenders are called ) get them			0
@entity56 has fashion genius @entity143 ( @entity144 doing a fun spin on @entity146 ) to create a wow dress that bursts into flame at the hem			1
like @entity66 before her , @entity56 is pursued by two laddies - in - waiting , in this case @entity153 ( @entity154 ) , the strapping @entity98 hunk and fellow illegal hunter she leaves behind , and @entity157 ( @entity158 ) , the baker 's son who joins @entity56 in the @entity39 and secretly pines for her			1
are you @entity162 or @entity163 ? you might not care as much , since neither has the exotic allure of a vampire or a wolf			0
but @entity154 ( " @entity168 , " with girlfriend @entity169 ) quickly establishes a strong , appealing presence			0
and @entity158 ( " @entity171 " ) brings humor and a bruised heart to a boy who needs to mature fast			1
dynamite actors dot the film			0
@entity177 is a brilliant blend of mirth and malice as @entity181 , a tv host who reps the dark side of @entity183 in this lethal version of " @entity185			0
" @entity186 brings malicious wit to the bewigged and powdered pr guru @entity188			1
" may the odds be ever in your favor , " announces @entity189 with inane sincerity			0
and the reliably stellar @entity194 cuts deep as the perpetually s * * * faced @entity195 , a former victor in the @entity39 now acting as mentor to both @entity56 and @entity163			1
when he 's not falling - down drunk , @entity195 instructs his @entity198 © s on how to suck up to sponsors who send supplies into the arena when a tribute wins audience favor			0
so - called reality tv is given a sharp , satirical kick as tributes learn to play and pander to hidden cameras			0
is @entity56 really falling for @entity163 as she nurses his wounds , or is she faking it to save her a * * and his ? discuss			1
sadly , the erotic heat that @entity43 generates between @entity56 and @entity163 in a hidden cave never rises above room temperature onscreen			1
hand - to - hand combat does fuel the intensity as @entity56 fights career tributes trained to go medieval on enemy ass			1
check out machete - wielding @entity218 ( @entity219 ) and knife - throwing @entity220 ( @entity221 ) , not to mention a swarm of deadly , genetically engineered wasps called @entity224			0
the caring bond @entity56 forms with @entity226 ( @entity227 ) , the youngest tribute , is just a brief break from the assaults aimed to make katniss trade her soul for survival			1
for all its compromises , " @entity39 " is a zeitgeist movie that captures the spirit of a soul - sucking age in which ego easily trumps common cause			0
ironically , the kill - to - win ethos that dominates movies from 1987 's prophetic " @entity245 " to the undiluted brutality of @entity244 's " @entity243 " in 2000 , may find its largest viewership in " @entity39			0
" but will mainstream audiences respond to the moral challenge churning under the pop - culture razzle - dazzle ? it 's anybody 's guess			0
my advice is to keep your eyes on @entity55 , who turns the movie into a victory by presenting a heroine propelled by principle instead of hooking up with the cutest boy			1
that 's what makes @entity56 revolutionary			1
may the odds be ever in her favor			0
