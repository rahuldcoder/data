-- when president @entity3 's campaign announced plans for a full - court press while @entity6 hold their convention in @entity8 , @entity9 , this week , some veteran political watchers marked the end of an era			1
after all , as much as there has ever been accepted " rules " of presidential politics , it was once a given that the opposing candidate ceded the convention week to his rival -- it was the polite thing to do			0
instead , the @entity3 campaign is doing anything but			1
not only will surrogates for the president blanket @entity8 and key battleground regions , but the campaign 's three key figures will also be doing their best to steal some of @entity27 's orchestrated thunder this week			1
@entity29 group airs ad in @entity8 on tuesday , the day @entity31 and @entity33 gov. @entity32 are scheduled to address the convention in prime time , @entity3 will kick off a two - day , three - state tour of swing states that include stops at college towns in @entity40 , @entity41 , and @entity42			1
the @entity3 campaign strategy : contrast the expectedly older demographic that historically is represented among @entity6 convention attendees with images of the president rallying thousands of enthusiastic young people			1
meanwhile , first lady @entity50 will appear on " the @entity51 with @entity52 " on wednesday , the same day vice presidential candidate @entity49 is set to make his big speech			2
the @entity3 campaign also planned to dispatch vice president @entity54 to @entity8 itself on monday but scrapped the trip on friday because it said it was concerned that a vice presidential visit would stress law enforcement resources already stretched thin by @entity60			1
on saturday , the campaign canceled @entity54 's tuesday events in @entity63 and @entity64			2
the @entity27 campaign says it has similar plans to " bracket " the @entity70 convention next week in @entity71 , @entity72 , though the exact campaign schedules of @entity49 and @entity27 have yet to be released			1
still , many democrats are expecting at least @entity49 will show up near @entity71 's @entity74 as @entity70 delegates get set to officially re-nominate @entity3 to the @entity70 presidential ticket			1
a look at @entity78 : ' she 's going to bloom where she 's planted ' to be sure , 2012 marks an emphatic end to the bygone courtesy of allowing the other campaign to have its convention moment			0
but the traditional nicety began unraveling at least two or three election cycles ago			0
it was then that party officials decided it was advantageous to hold conventions much later in the summer , when voters were off the beach , sending their kids back to school , and at last starting to tune into the presidential race en masse			0
it may have been relatively harmless for a candidate to lay low for a week in july , but late august or early september ? forget about it			0
for example , then - @entity70 candidate @entity101 decided to take a vacation on picture - perfect @entity104 , @entity72 , when @entity6 convened in @entity105 in late july of 2000			1
the @entity107 campaign largely returned the favor two weeks later when democrats convened in @entity109			0
both campaigns reasoned most @entity111 still were n't tuning in to the day - day machinations of the race as the dog days of summer continued			0
four years later , @entity107 remained secluded on his ranch while @entity70 nominated sen. @entity116 in @entity117 in july			0
but with @entity6 's decision to hold their convention more than a month later in early september , coupled with a more fervent news cycle than ever before , the @entity116 campaign decided it would not extend the same courtesy			2
the @entity70 presidential nominee was dispatched to @entity124 and @entity125 for speeches that week while his running mate , then - sen. @entity127 , held court in @entity72 and @entity42			2
candy explains : political conventions miffed that @entity6 held their convention so late in 2004 , @entity70 followed suit four years later			2
that meant both conventions fell in successive weeks at the very end of the summer of 2008 and , by extension , both candidates remained on the trail while the rival party crowned its nominee			0
then - @entity6 candidate @entity140 attended two events in his home state of @entity143 while @entity70 convened in @entity144 , @entity41			1
the next week , then - @entity70 nominee @entity3 barnstormed at seven rallies across three states as @entity140 got set to accept his party 's nomination in @entity149 , @entity150			1
what was once polite has fallen victim to expediency			0
as fall approaches and the now - fractured and partisan media climate demands a response to every barb from the other side , it would be nothing short of political malfeasance to allow a candidate to cede the klieg lights entirely			0
by the numbers : @entity8 , @entity9 @entity0 's @entity165 , @entity166 , and @entity167 contributed to this report			0

candidates in the past laid low while other party was having its convention
both @entity3 and @entity27 will campaign during other party 's big week
@entity3 campaign has several high - *profile* events while @entity6 *gathers* in @entity8
@entity27 and @entity49 have events planned next week during @entity70 convention
