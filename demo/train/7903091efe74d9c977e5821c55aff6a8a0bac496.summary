it is a stark and sobering fact of @entity2 life in the 21st century -- black , @entity5 and @entity4 boys and young men are less likely to graduate , stay out of jail and get a job than those who are white			2
chances are greater they 'll grow up with a single parent or none at all , wo n't read well , and will get suspended or expelled from school or just drop out			2
saddest of all , such statistics are n't new or particularly shocking in a society that has come to expect such class , racial and ethnic disparities			2
president @entity19 launched his " @entity21 " initiative three months ago to focus on solutions to such chronic and deep - rooted social ills			1
the initiative included a task force to examine the issue , and an invitation for businesses and foundations to help out			1
government , and private sector , and philanthropy , and all the faith communities , we all have a responsibility to help provide you the tools you need , " @entity19 told a group of black students in february when he announced the initiative			1
" we 've got to help you knock down some of the barriers that you experience			2
" transcript : @entity19 announces ' @entity21 ' on friday , the @entity43 released the task force 's first report -- a recitation of the challenges faced by young black , @entity5 and @entity4 males struggling with a legacy of poverty and accompanying hardship , as well as ways to help them persevere and succeed			1
in a conference call with reporters , administration officials emphasized the initiative was n't a new government program , but instead sought to assess existing public and private efforts to assess what worked and could be expanded			1
the goal is " sharpening what we do to make sure we are really maximizing the impact of the federal resources that we have , " said @entity63 , the @entity43 director of domestic policy			2
also maximized would be the participation and contributions of a growing segment of the @entity2 population , noted @entity43 senior adviser @entity72 , who said : " it 's not only the right thing to do , it 's vital to the long - term strength of our communities and the economy of the @entity2			1
" she noted the @entity19 administration launched the @entity79 five years ago to focus on equal opportunity , and now the " @entity21 " initiative sought to do the same for other historically disadvantaged demographics			1
the 60 - page task force report identifies key milestones for predicting later success for a non-white boy or young man , including :  getting a healthy start in life and school  @entity91 well by third grade  graduating from high school  completing post-secondary education or training  getting a job  staying on track and getting a second chance " at each of these milestones , some individuals start to fall behind , " the task force report says			1
" once a young person falls behind , success becomes exponentially more difficult			1
" it presents a litany of statistics that amplify the magnitude of the challenge			2
black , @entity5 and @entity4 children are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as white children			0
about two in three black children and one in three @entity117 children live with one parent , and those raised by single mothers are way more likely to drop out of school			0
among black males 10 to 24 years old , homicide is the leading cause of death			0
and in 2012 , black males were six times more likely to be imprisoned than white males , while @entity117 were 2.5 times more likely			0
to respond to such disparities , @entity19 will call for @entity2 to commit themselves to long - term mentoring or tutoring programs to provide guidance and stability to children and young men of color , said @entity136 , the @entity43 cabinet secretary who co-authored the task force report			1
other focuses will be expanding access to quality pre-school and early education programs , eliminating expulsions and suspensions in early learning settings , and promoting literacy and reading programs , the task force report said			1
the initiative also includes investments expected to top $ 200 million from foundations and organizations involved in educational and social issues			1
some of the wonky language of the report reflected the long - running programs , some public and some private , on which its recommendations and proposals are based			1
for reducing violence and providing boys and young men of color a second chance , its recommendation is to " institutionalize community oriented policing practices in the field and employ methods to address racial and ethnic bias within the juvenile and criminal justice systems			1
" translation : improve coordination between federal , state , city and community leaders , as well as police and neighborhood groups , while reforming the juvenile justice system to keep kids and young men out of reform schools or jail cells and ensuring that those in prison have access to a quality education			1
back in february , @entity19 spoke with rare candor about his own childhood in an effort to show that people from broken homes and other challenging backgrounds can succeed			0
" i did n't have a dad in the house and i was angry about it , even though i did n't necessarily realize it at the time , " he said			0
" i made bad choices			0
i got high without always thinking about the harm that it could do			0
i did n't always take school as seriously as i should have			0
sometimes i sold myself short			0
" he compared himself to young men now who are growing up like he did			2
" the only difference is that i grew up in an environment that was a little bit more forgiving			0
so when i made a mistake , the consequences were not as severe , " the president said			2
" i had people who encouraged me , not just my mom and grandparents , but wonderful teachers and community leaders			0
and they pushed me to work hard , and study hard , and make the most of myself			0
and if i did n't listen , they said it again			0
and if i did n't listen , they said it a third time - and they would give me second chances and third chances			0
" they never gave up on me , and so i did n't give up on myself			0
