@entity0 , @entity1 -- when first lady @entity4 took the stage tuesday night at the @entity6 , she told the kind of tale about president @entity9 that only a wife can			1
she told of the profound impact of watching his grandmother and single mother 's efforts to work and raise children in a system that often did n't value their efforts			0
" @entity9 's grandmother started out as a secretary at a community bank , and she moved quickly up the ranks			2
but like so many women , she hit a glass ceiling , " @entity4 said			2
" and for years , men no more qualified than she was , men she had actually trained , were promoted up the ladder ahead of her , earning more and more money while @entity9 's family continued to scrape by			2
" but day after day , she kept on waking up at dawn to catch the bus , arriving at work before anyone else , giving her best without complaint or regret			0
and she would often tell @entity9 , ' so long as you kids do well , @entity40 , that 's all that really matters			2
' " the first lady 's remarks were much more than a counterpoint to stories @entity46 told last week of her husband , @entity48 presidential nominee @entity47 , during the @entity48 convention last week			1
the first lady was a heavy hitter on a female - dominated opening night speakers ' roster that included @entity54 , president of the @entity55 ; @entity56 , for whom a gender pay equity law is named ; and @entity59 minority leader @entity58 and a cadre of @entity6 women from that chamber , among others			1
first lady seeks to reignite flame for president both presidential campaigns say their female - heavy convention speaker rolls are about underscoring that women 's issues are @entity71 's issues			1
however , the female - centric messages also speak to the parties ' battle over the deeply coveted female voting bloc			2
" it 's aimed at a specific group of voters that both parties need , " @entity76 , senior editor at the @entity77 said			0
" this whole argument is aimed at appealing to this group and keeping them in the fold			0
" in @entity0 , @entity6 women took the stage and hammered home the message that on issues of equal pay , reproductive health , health care for seniors , education and other matters they are poised " to move @entity71 forward			0
" when " sisters are @entity96 " played , both the women on stage and those in the crowd waved and swayed to the beat			0
on wednesday , sen. @entity103 of @entity104 , chairwoman of the @entity105 , is scheduled to speak at an @entity107 reception where she 's on tap to discuss the " historic number of women running for @entity111 this year			0
" @entity112 , the @entity113 law student and birth control advocate who made national headlines when conservative radio host @entity116 called her a " slut , " is slated to speak at the @entity6 on wednesday			0
" at this time the @entity121 is the only party for women because of the controversial stance the @entity48 has taken , " said @entity120 delegate @entity119			1
not to be outdone , the first full day of last week 's @entity124 was also heavy with female speakers including congressional candidate @entity126 of @entity127 , rep. @entity128 of @entity104 , sen. @entity129 of @entity130 and @entity131			2
@entity132 of @entity133 and @entity134 of @entity135			0
@entity137 gov. @entity136 and former secretary of state @entity138 had prime - time speaking spots later that week			0
" the @entity48 is doing a good job of demonstrating the softer side of the @entity48 , that it is not just the party of business guys in suits , " @entity2 contributor and @entity48 strategist @entity141 said			2
in his acceptance speech , @entity47 offered full - throated support of women 's equal role in the political process			1
" when my mom ran for the @entity111 , my dad was there for her every step of the way			0
i can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice , ' why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation ? ' " but , despite a week in which @entity48 speakers sought to appeal to female voters , a @entity2 / @entity166 survey conducted just after the end of the @entity124 found that the double - digit gender gap between @entity9 and @entity47 was unchanged			1
over the past few months , the battle over women voters has taken some nasty turns			2
@entity111 candidate @entity176 's recent comments that " legitimate rape " rarely resulted in pregnancy sent republicans trying to push him out of the way and revived the contentious " war on women " debate from earlier this year			0
@entity121 pounced and tried to connect @entity47 and running mate @entity184 to @entity176 's comments through a web video called " the @entity47 - @entity187			1
" earlier this year , both presidential campaigns were roiled by heated rhetoric over a federal requirement that religious institutions provide contraception coverage for employees			0
@entity121 said @entity48 pushback against the law and other proposed contraception regulation measures in several statehouses was an attempt to roll back women 's rights			1
republicans said @entity121 were oversimplifying the issue in a ploy for female voters			1
" i think it 's a manufactured war on women , this narrative that @entity48 want to take away birth control and access to doctors , " @entity203 , chairwoman of the @entity204 said			1
" this is a manufactured crisis to get the women 's vote			2
" according to the most recent @entity2 / @entity166 poll , @entity47 trails the @entity9 - @entity216 ticket by 12 points among women			1
when @entity219 won a second term in 2004 , in a relatively close election , he had only a 3 - point deficit among women			0
opinion : what candidates ' wives are telling us in a time / @entity2 poll of likely voters released last week , @entity9 led @entity47 by 12 points in @entity231 and 10 points in @entity1 among women voters			1
women make up roughly 51 % of the nation 's electorate			1
the @entity48 women gathered at the @entity240 at the @entity124 last week were a perfectly coiffed phalanx of policy parsing , politically - savvy conservatives on a mission to show their party does speak to women 's concerns			1
as they lounged on chic white chairs beneath chandeliers dripping with pink flowers , the women plotted how to leverage social media to elevate the party 's platform and bemoaned the nation 's current economic state			0
however , the ladies steered well clear of discussing the types of polarizing social issues such as abortion and contraception that led @entity121 to claim @entity48 are launching a " war on women "			1
" women have always played a huge role ( in the @entity48 ) ; one of the big problems has been the rhetoric , " said @entity262 , policy director at the @entity263 , a conservative think tank that put on the " @entity265 " event			1
however , @entity203 and some @entity48 women said they also feel the tension between supporting their party and @entity48 leadership 's push for social policies which some @entity48 women , including several high - profile members of @entity280 , disagree with			1
earlier this year , both sen. @entity281 , @entity282 , and sen. @entity283 , @entity284 , said they were concerned about some of the @entity48 rhetoric on women 's rights			1
some rank and file @entity48 women agree			2
" republicans are for getting government out of the boardroom , so they should be for getting the government out of the bedroom , " said @entity291 , chairwoman of @entity292 , from the convention floor in @entity294 last week			0
in the meantime , groups that represent women say all the pomp and circumstance surrounding both conventions is fine for the television cameras , but they are encouraging female voters to look beyond the flash and concentrate on such issues as reproductive health and stabilizing the economy			1
" it 's important not to be sidetracked by larger rhetoric ; tune in to the specific ideas			0
both conventions are trying to set a tone			0
dig deep , " said @entity317 , president of the nonpartisan @entity318 of @entity231			0
" we need the candidates to do more than tell about their childhood			0
what are they going to do ? " five things we learned from @entity324 of the @entity6 @entity2 's @entity325 , @entity326 and @entity327 contributed to this report .			0
