@entity0 -- on one of the coldest nights of the year , there was no mistaking the northwest @entity0 home of @entity8 operatives @entity9 and @entity10 with the @entity11 or @entity13 @entity12			0
but it smelled like the @entity16 inside the stately brick home thursday night , attendees said			1
the aroma of black - eyed peas , ham , biscuits and sweet tea drifted from room to room as roughly 60 @entity8 operatives chatted and exchanged ideas about how their party , one that once dominated the @entity16 , could start a comeback from years of @entity31 victories			1
the @entity32 , a super pac of @entity33 whose goal is to provide money and infrastructure to down - ballot @entity33 -- state legislators , attorneys general and mayors -- put on the " @entity42			1
" " we are trying to turn the @entity16 blue , " said @entity43 , the group 's executive director			1
" this event is all about how @entity33 can win in the @entity16 again			1
" and no detail at the event diverged from that goal , @entity43 said			0
for dessert , the group turned traditional red velvet cupcakes blue , symbolic of what it 's trying to do in the @entity16			1
first on @entity1 : @entity31 move to overhaul 2016 primary @entity58 's gloomy prediction since president @entity58 signed the @entity60 , only two @entity8 presidential campaigns have won @entity11 , @entity13 or @entity61 : native son @entity62 swept the @entity16 in 1976 , while @entity63 won @entity61 nearly 20 years later			1
but those victories are distant memories			2
@entity58 proved to be a prophet			0
after signing the landmark civil rights legislation , he lamented to an aide : " i think we just delivered the @entity16 to the @entity31 for a long time to come			1
" in 2012 , for example , out of the 25 congressional districts in those three states , @entity31 won all but seven			0
all three states have a @entity31 governor , and republicans control each state 's legislature			2
will challenges from right hurt @entity31 chances of taking back @entity81 ? nevertheless , @entity82 said they are poised to make a comeback and prove @entity58 's " long time to come " is over			1
they point out the generation that vehemently rejected @entity58 's @entity60 is dying off			2
and in its place is a younger , more progressive and diverse group of @entity88			0
" his prophecy was right , but that generation is about over now , " said @entity89 , chairman of the @entity90			0
in order to win in this part of the country , we have to play a nearly perfect game , and we have to capitalize on any fumbles and turnovers on the other side			0
" rebuilding in @entity103 @entity33 once dominated the region			1
between 1876 and 1964 , @entity61 only went against a @entity105 once in presidential elections			0
@entity11 and @entity13 , likewise , supported a candidate other than a @entity105 two times			0
their stranglehold on @entity88 politics bred loyal , proud @entity33 who tightened their grip			1
but when political fortunes turned , they turned quickly			2
@entity33 have won some statewide races but faced repeated national and congressional defeats			1
in looking back on the years of the " @entity117 , " some @entity33 said they now believe their near - century of dominance hurt the party			1
" @entity82 never developed an opposition type or style of party that you have to be in today 's world , " said former @entity11 gov. @entity120 , a founder of the @entity32			1
" democrats in the @entity16 have not had the ability to push back on various issues			1
" the biggest campaign moments of 2013 @entity120 's point : if there is political parity , each party understands winning and losing			1
when the massive shift of power occurred in the 1960s and ' 70s , @entity33 were n't prepared to be in the minority and did n't have the infrastructure to dig themselves out			1
@entity120 , who ran a competitive but losing race for the @entity81 in 2008 against @entity31 sen. @entity141 , said for years during the @entity31 domination of the @entity16 , he thought the national party would swoop in to help rebuild			1
" i kept waiting for someone to ride in on a white horse and say , ' here is help , ' " @entity120 said with a laugh			0
" now , there is some obligation in the @entity16 for us , as @entity33 , to make sure that we work to built that infrastructure , that bench , and that we help			1
" that 's the mission of @entity120 's super pac			0
the group plans to help candidates by not only raising money but by also providing campaigns with data about which voters in a certain area are persuadable -- information that has helped @entity33 on the national level			1
in the @entity16 , @entity120 points out , that information could be even more important			1
with a small margin for error in most races , knowing which voters could be persuaded by a @entity105 's argument is key , he said			0
what 's more , the former governor sees the effort as not only a way to win the @entity16 as soon as possible but also to help create a culture of winning			1
" from our vantage point , successful candidates are well - funded candidates that have the resources and infrastructure to get their message out , " said @entity43 , the group 's executive director			0
searching for signs of hope ask a @entity88 @entity105 if he or she can win statewide , and you will get a wide array of anecdotes and theories			0
some point to the last @entity8 governor in each state , while others to president @entity196 winning 43.5 % of the vote in @entity11 without spending any money there in 2012			1
but the most often - cited anecdote -- by far -- is the success that @entity82 had in 2013 municipal elections in @entity11			2
for the first time in nearly 30 years , a @entity105 was elected mayor of @entity205 , while @entity206 elected its first - ever black mayor -- a @entity105			0
after the win , @entity82 heralded the day as " @entity209 " and celebrated the victories as a sign of things to come			1
10 more secrets from campaign 2012 the key to those races , operatives say , is that @entity82 managed them and proved -- in a small way -- that winning in a deep red state is not impossible			1
" it is essential to build bottom up and especially in the @entity16 as we reconnect with voters and share a consistent and solid message out there that is different from the @entity31 , " said @entity220 , a @entity105 from the @entity16 who worked with @entity222 's 2008 presidential campaign			2
@entity220 , who has long helped national @entity33 reach @entity88 voters , said he is more hopeful than ever before that @entity33 could make headway in local elections in 2014 and 2016			2
speaking with an unmistakably @entity11 twang , @entity220 said the key to winning " persuadable voters " in the @entity16 is convincing them you share similar heritage and values			1
" we are @entity88 , we are @entity33 ; we hold the same values you do , " he said , mimicking the pitch he could make to voters			2
" we are moving a little bit beyond strident partisanship , and we are able to develop messages now that are going to stick			0
" @entity120 echoed that message			0
" i may not know how to run a commissioner 's race in @entity249 , but i do know how to win in @entity11 , " he said			0
" i do know that @entity13 is the no. 1 team in @entity103			0
i do know where @entity251 is			0
i do know what @entity254 racing is about , and i attend a lot			0
" their point : it takes @entity88 to win in the @entity16			1
hitting the ' white win number ' @entity261 is @entity61 's last @entity8 governor to date			0
he won 53 % of the overall vote in 1998 , but there was a stark black - white divide -- @entity261 lost the white vote by 21 % but won the @entity268 - @entity267 vote by a whopping 82 %			0
for @entity261 , the key to victory was not getting too buried by losing the white vote and winning big with the black vote , according to @entity272 , a pollster who focuses on @entity82			1
any @entity105 running in the @entity16 , he said , should expect to lose the white vote			2
" whether you are running for governor or senator , it is about hitting the white win number , " @entity272 said			0
" you have to hit a certain number of whites , which means you have to make a certain number of whites comfortable that you are a @entity82 and not a national @entity105			2
" but for @entity33 in the @entity16 , there is a noticeable push and pull between the gains they are making because of changing demographics -- with both @entity61 and @entity11 now more than 30 % black -- and the negative setbacks the national party is causing because of unpopular positions on guns , religion and many social issues that even @entity33 admit @entity31 have won on down @entity16			1
so as reliably @entity8 voters -- african - americans and @entity296 -- move into these states and slowly lighten the shade of red , @entity31 candidates have made it a point to tie their @entity8 challengers to the national party			2
" the comparisons were that i was a another @entity308 , " said @entity304 , who became the @entity8 mayor of @entity306 , @entity11 , this year			0
" i got bashed with it a bit , " he said with a laugh , noting that he thought it would be hard to turn a gray - haired , burly @entity311 with a thick drawl into @entity308 , the liberal @entity314 minority leader who hails from the @entity316 area			0
pollster @entity272 admits that one of the biggest problems @entity82 have is " the perception of what a national @entity105 is			2
" but the @entity308 comparison did n't stick to @entity304 , and he won the @entity306 mayor 's race fairly easy			0
what he had working in his favor were demographics -- @entity306 is a majority - black town in the @entity11			0
some see a problem with being tied to the national party , while others -- such as @entity120 -- believe that while in some races " candidates will need to differentiate themselves , " the majority of @entity82 " have a lot to be proud of " in the national party			2
@entity120 acknowledges that turning the @entity339 will be difficult			0
" most people would say that just could n't happen , " he said			0
but in his opinion , @entity33 have to try .			2

@entity343 has a steep *climb* to try to take back @entity16 from republicans
@entity33 once held stranglehold on region , which has turned red since 1960s
@entity82 believe they have to create a culture of winning from cycle to cycle
they point to small victories in campaigns that @entity82 managed
