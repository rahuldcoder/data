-- it was n't supposed to happen			2
@entity3 's youth were supposed to be apathetic and disheartened			2
we were n't supposed to be at the polls			2
the word was that we had fallen out of love with president @entity8 , the man who inspired us four years ago			1
big money would silence our voices and make our efforts inconsequential			0
two - thousand - twelve would be nothing like 2008 ; the youth vote would n't be the decisive force it was four years ago			1
in two consecutive elections , more than half of my generation voted : it is clear now , if it was n't before , that we recognize our responsibility to our country			1
in fact , this time we made up an even larger percentage ( 19 % ) of the electorate than we did four years ago ( 18 % )			0
opinion roundup : where @entity8 , and @entity3 , go from here we still support the man who has stood up for us : sixty percent of voters age 18 - 29 chose president @entity8 on tuesday			1
i do n't think any young person was surprised , however , that older @entity3 had no idea what we were thinking			1
my generation has been burdened by a misguided war that damaged our credibility abroad			1
we 've been told the national debt is so large that we 'll never be able to pay it back			0
we have experienced an economic crisis unlike any since the @entity42			0
we have watched our environment head toward disaster and our government stand at an impasse			0
we have been told over and over that @entity3 is no longer the great country it once was			0
but our participation in the election and our overwhelming support for the president are indicative of our hope for the future and our compulsion to start tackling these problems now			1
opinion : women gain wider access to power we do n't support the president just because he 's " cool , " plays basketball or listens to @entity62 instead , we recognize that he , too , is ready to meet these great challenges			1
and we want to help him build a stronger , safer , more just @entity3			0
this election also revealed that my generation has moved past many of the debates of our parents and grandparents : the youth vote was imperative to the legalization of same - sex marriage in @entity75 and @entity76 , the rejection of constitutional discrimination in @entity79 and the election of a president who supports equal pay , reproductive rights and fair immigration reform			1
for us , these issues are a matter of common sense			0
we may have been disenchanted with politics over the past few years , but this election proves that it 's not because we do n't care			0
rather , we reject petty posturing , partisan gridlock and inaction			0
voting is great , but it 's not an accomplishment			1
we recognize that going to the polls is the easiest thing we are going to have to do			0
in august , i wrote that in this election , young people would display a deep commitment to our country and its ideals , and provide a preview of the @entity3 we intend to build			2
we accomplished the first two , and that gives me hope that we will succeed in building a future of which we can be proud			0
the next time someone claims that my generation does n't care and wo n't help , remind them that we showed up , voted for change and are ready to get to work			2
letter from the editor : election night was about the facts the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity118 .			1

@entity118 : young voters were said to lack *enthusiasm* and to be unlikely to vote
he says they turned out to support president @entity8 , causes they believe in
voting is a responsibility , he says , and his generation is prepared to do much more
