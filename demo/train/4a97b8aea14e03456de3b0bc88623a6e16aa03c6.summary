-- in another controversy surrounding @entity5 gov. @entity4 , @entity2 mayor @entity1 said sunday that @entity4 directly ordered the withholding of @entity8 recovery funds unless she backed a redevelopment plan he favored			1
appearing on @entity0 's " @entity11 , " @entity1 said she was told by a member of @entity4 's administration that @entity8 relief funds hinged on her support for a real estate development project and that the directive was coming directly from @entity4			1
" she said that to me -- is that this is a direct message from the governor , " @entity1 said , referring to lt. gov. @entity18 , who @entity1 said approached her in a parking lot in may to deliver the message			2
it 's " stunning " and " outrageous , " but true , the @entity2 mayor told @entity0 's @entity26			1
" i stand by my word			0
" later in the day , she released a statement saying that she had met with the @entity29 for several hours at its request and provided the office with her journal and other documents			1
" as they pursue this investigation , i will provide any requested information and testify under oath about the facts of what happened when the lieutenant governor came to @entity2 and told me that @entity8 aid would be contingent on moving forward with a private development project , " she said			1
@entity1 said the @entity4 administration wanted her to approve a project by @entity46 , a real estate developer with ties to @entity4 's administration			1
when asked by @entity0 to respond to @entity1 's accusation that @entity4 had a direct hand in the threat , @entity4 spokesman @entity50 refused to address it and instead referred to a previous statement , which said @entity1 's allegations that relief funds were withheld is based on partisan politics			1
the allegations come as other controversies revolve around @entity4 's administration			2
in one , evidence mounts showing that @entity4 aides were involved in tying up traffic in a town at the foot of the @entity66 in what may have been an act of political retribution against another mayor			2
in another , the @entity4 administration hired a firm for @entity74 tourism ads that cost nearly twice as much as the next highest proposal			2
this is the first time @entity4 has been directly connected to the controversy			2
@entity4 administration pushes back in his statement to @entity0 on saturday , @entity50 blasted @entity1 's claim that the funds were based on the real estate project			1
he said her accusations are false , adding , " it 's very clear partisan politics are at play here as @entity88 mayors with a political ax to grind come out of the woodwork and try to get their faces on television			0
" @entity50 went on to attack the cable news channel that first broke the news saturday			0
" @entity95 is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to governor @entity4 and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him , " @entity50 said			1
@entity95 said its story is based on an interview with @entity1 " and e-mails and personal notes she shared with @entity95			2
" the governor 's spokesman also said the mayor and @entity106 have had a " productive relationship , " noting an august tweet by @entity1 saying she 's " very glad governor @entity4 has been our gov. " @entity4 marches on as controversy at home unfolds @entity1 's comments saturday and sunday are a change from what she told @entity0 just last week , when she said that while she wondered whether @entity8 aid funds were being withheld because she did n't endorse the governor 's re-election , she concluded that " i do n't think that 's the case			1
" " i do n't think it was retaliation and i do n't have any reason to think it 's retaliation , but i 'm not satisfied with the amount of money i 've gotten so far , " @entity1 told @entity0 last week , not mentioning her concerns about the redevelopment project			1
but sunday morning , @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity26 that she did n't speak out before because she did n't think anyone would believe her , adding that she is now " offering to testify under oath			1
" @entity1 admitted to supporting @entity4 in the past , saying she is not a part of " the @entity88 machine			1
" but the information around the @entity66 scandal -- involving lane closures at the entrance to the busy bridge , apparently for political retaliation -- prompted her to speak			0
she said she sees parallels between her story and the bridge controversy : " the @entity4 administration using their authority to try and get something			0
" @entity1 said @entity18 appeared to feel guilty for delivering the message			0
" i believe if and when she is asked to testify under oath , the truth will come out , because i believe she will be truthful and she will tell the truth , " @entity1 told @entity26			0
@entity1 also said she is speaking because she wants @entity2 to receive an appropriate level of funds in the second round of recovery dollars about to be released			1
@entity8 recovery funds after @entity8 , @entity2 was 80 % underwater			1
@entity1 told @entity0 last week that @entity2 received only about $ 300,000 of the roughly $ 100 million in state funds the city requested for flood prevention			1
@entity50 , @entity4 's spokesman , told @entity0 that @entity1 asked for $ 100 million from a roughly $ 300 million pot of money for which there was $ 14 billion worth of requests			1
since that request , @entity50 said , @entity2 has been approved for nearly $ 70 million in aid			2
the city has also been identified as a pilot community for a federal program to prevent flooding , one of only four such projects in @entity5			0
@entity1 , however , had a different account of allocated funds			2
she said the $ 70 million given to @entity2 was through flood insurance and other mechanisms that did not need approval from the state			0
she received only $ 300,000 in @entity4 - approved funds , she said			2
@entity0 received images of journal entries from the mayor 's office that @entity1 told @entity0 she wrote at the time			1
see the journal entries in one , @entity1 writes that the conversation with @entity184 left her upset and shattered the image she had of @entity4			1
" i thought he was honest , i thought he was moral -- i thought he was something very different			0
this week i found out he 's cut from the same corrupt cloth that i have been fighting for the last four years			0
i am so disappointed -- it literally brings tears to my eyes , " the journal entry says			0
@entity1 also wrote that @entity18 told her she needs " to move forward with the @entity194 project			2
it is very important to the gov. " @entity50 , asked by @entity0 about @entity1 's comments on @entity198 , said , " mayor @entity1 's characterization of her conversation in @entity2 is categorically false			1
" three days after the purported @entity184 comments , state @entity203 commissioner @entity202 was on a panel with @entity1 , discussing @entity8 relief			1
@entity1 told @entity95 that @entity202 leaned over and told her , " if you move ( the redevelopment project ) forward , the money would start flowing to you			1
" in a statement to @entity0 , @entity202 spokeswoman @entity211 said , " mayor @entity1 's allegations that on may 16 , 2013 , in front a live auditorium audience commissioner constable conditioned @entity2 's receipt of @entity8 aid on her moving forward with a development project is categorically false			1
" debate about redevelopment @entity1 's claims center around a property owned by @entity46 , which had its plan for " redevelopment " of a three - block area of @entity2 rejected by the city 's planning board			1
instead , the panel voted to classify the area owned by the company as available for " rehabilitation			0
" the " redevelopment " label was sought because its tax incentives offered a much more lucrative deal for the development company			0
aides and advisers to @entity4 have ties to @entity239 & @entity240 , the law firm representing the @entity46			0
the @entity242 rejected the " redevelopment " plan three days before @entity1 was allegedly first approached by @entity184			2
@entity1 provided @entity95 with a 2012 e-mail from @entity239 & @entity240 's @entity245 -- previously commissioner of the @entity247 -- to @entity2 's lawyer that shows her lobbying on behalf of the project : " our client , the @entity46 , has specifically asked us to speak with you regarding its property in @entity2			1
" @entity245 is not the only connection between the @entity4 administration and the @entity46			0
the @entity240 in @entity258 & @entity240 is @entity240 , chairman of the @entity259 , who was appointed by @entity4			0
@entity240 was recently served with a subpoena in the @entity66 case by an investigative committee seeking relevant documents			0
the @entity46 told @entity0 , " we have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation			0
if it turns out to be true , it would be deplorable			0
" the law firm , in a statement , denied @entity1 's allegations and said it did nothing wrong : " the firm 's and ms. @entity245 's conduct in the representation of our client was appropriate in all respects			0
further , ms. @entity245 notes that while @entity279 , she never met with mayor @entity280 or the @entity46 to discuss the @entity2 project			1
" @entity1 told @entity95 that she could n't agree to the @entity46 proposal because " there are fundamental problems with the site in northern @entity2 , including traffic and flooding issues , that would be magnified if the plan were to go forward			2
a spokesperson for the @entity46 told @entity0 that it still hopes to develop the site under the designation of " rehabilitation , " but that this is " contingent on the plan the city comes up with			0
" another investigation ? as word of the allegations spread saturday , the chairman of the investigative committee tasked with looking into the @entity66 scandal weighed in			0
assemblyman @entity300 , @entity301 , told @entity0 : " this certainly has attracted our attention			0
we need to obtain all relevant facts , confer with our special counsel and determine the committee 's best course of action			0
" opinion : is @entity4 presidential ? @entity311 is a @entity0 investigative correspondent			2
@entity312 and @entity313 contributed to this report .			0
