-- the creators of an app that helps people send anonymous emails are coming under fire for a pr stunt that did n't quite go as planned			1
over the last couple days , @entity7 , a new service that allows people to send anonymous emails , sent a number of reporters questionable emails as part of a push to promote the app. an email sent via @entity7 to a @entity18 reporter : " dear neighbors , would you mind stop ( sic ) walking naked at home ? we can see you every morning when having breakfast			1
" see also : the @entity28 's guide to @entity29 emails sent to @entity18 , as well as reporters from other publications , ranged from nonsensical to more than a little creepy			1
leak cofounder @entity34 confirmed to @entity18 the emails were sent to reporters as part of a pr push			0
" we decided to send them to some journalists we liked thinking that it was funnier to live the @entity7 experience than receiving a regular press release , " @entity34 wrote in an email			1
he did , however , acknowledge the company may have been a bit " clumsy " in its attempts			2
the app launched last week			2
@entity34 , who is based in @entity49 , says it was created in a single weekend with the help of his friend and cofounder @entity52			0
in a post on @entity55 explains he was inspired by apps such as @entity57 which encourage anonymous sharing			2
" i heard about @entity57 and started to use it , " he wrote			0
" i loved it and enjoyed the excitement of sharing for the first time my secret garden with everyone			0
but there is no @entity57 community in @entity49 yet , so the experience was a bit frustrating			0
" while some apps that encourage anonymous sharing have gotten flack for their potential to enable bullying and other negative interactions , @entity34 says he wants @entity7 to be used for good			1
" we wanted @entity7 to be a really positive and exciting tool , " he says			1
" it 's sure that people can send negative leaks , but that is really not what the product is about			0
it 's about saying the truth you 're ashamed to say			0
and if it 's getting negative you can block emails from @entity7			1
" no word on how those anonymous emails to journalists fit into that scheme			0

anonymous email app *criticized* for " creepy " reporter *messages*
@entity7 lets users send email without using their own *address*
@entity100 said stunt was meant to be funny but was " clumsy "
