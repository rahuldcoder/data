@entity0 -- in the usually sleepy world of @entity0 stock exchange filings , a new document is gaining attention for its unintentionally hilarious descriptions of nightclub life			1
the 378 - page prospectus lays out the risks and potential rewards of investing in a new stock offering for " @entity12 , " the owner of three nightclubs in @entity0			1
in doing so , the document puts exact definitions on terms that may seem obvious to anyone who has ever stayed out past midnight			2
clubs , for example , are defined as establishments that include " a dance floor and high - energy music			1
" the prospectus elaborates , explaining that " they are equipped with @entity26 booths where music that is intended to motivate customers to dance is played , and the volume of such music is usually high			1
" club - goers apparently tend to buy lots of beverages , including champagne and something called a cocktail , which is " generally known as alcoholic beverages served by glass and prepared by bartenders mixing different alcohol and ingredients			0
" want to understand more late - night lingo ? the prospectus tells us " there has been a trend of ' club - hopping ' developing in @entity0 in recent years which means customers have the tendency to visit multiple clubs in one night			1
" vips are given special privileges , including free entry , discounts and other perks			0
" for instance , the managers of the @entity19 may assist vip customers to store their unfinished bottle of liquor or wine upon request			0
" another great revelation ? in addition to liquor licenses , @entity0 clubs are required to have " dancing endorsements			2
" without such permission , it seems the club could turn into a scene out of " @entity72			0
" of course , the prospectus is n't supposed to be a guide to @entity0 nightlife			2
the document is aimed at potential shareholders , not potential clubgoers			0
with @entity12 shares already trading at nearly twice the offering price , those investors may be laughing all the way to the bank .			0
