@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's the kind of @entity1 town made for daydreaming : quiet streets and sunny skies , a place where tranquility seems rarely to be disturbed			2
but according to police , as well as classified @entity14 diplomatic cables published by @entity15 , the @entity11 suburb of @entity0 was the scene of an international assassination plot			1
the scheme involved would - be killers hiding out in a low - budget motel and an elaborate plan that , at first , involved shooting the victim , but later centered on running him over with a van , police documents disclose			2
" i 've been a police officer here for more than 20 years , and i 've never investigated anything like this , " said @entity0 police lt. @entity26			2
it all unraveled on a late summer day in 2009 , when a would - be hit man hired by an @entity35 national named @entity34 got cold feet and called police from a local gas station			1
" this person went on to tell us that for the past four days , they together had been scheming how to assassinate , how to kill another @entity0 resident , " @entity26 said			0
police said the target in @entity0 was @entity45 , an @entity35 - @entity14 dissident who is the radio voice of a small group called @entity48 , devoted to the overthrow of the @entity35 government			1
the @entity35 government calls tondar a terrorist group , but the @entity52 says it is only a propaganda outlet			2
according to police reports , the informant offered proof : the purchase of a cheap van from a used - car dealer that would be used to run down and kill the target			1
he told detectives he had been paid $ 5,000 to kill @entity45 , with another $ 27,000 delivered to his mother back in @entity35			1
the plotters decided to use a van after deciding that buying a gun would be too risky , the reports state			0
the informant told police that @entity34 , the mastermind , had fled @entity0 and was about to leave @entity11 on a plane			1
@entity26 said @entity0 detectives found him in an airport hotel under his own name and arrested him in his room			0
along with his laptop computer , police seized $ 2,100 in cash			0
" they were crisp $ 100 bills			0
there was a stack of them			0
and around it was a bank wrapping , and they were all written in @entity84 , " he said			0
according to those leaked @entity14 diplomatic cables , this was n't the first time @entity34 had been implicated in an assassination attempt			1
a prominent @entity35 dissident in @entity91 , @entity92 , " had been targeted by @entity35 intelligence , " according to one cable			1
@entity92 is a prominent @entity94 commentator based in @entity91 , and @entity34 had contacted him several months before his @entity1 arrest , claiming to be a " big fan , " the january 2010 account states			1
but @entity92 became suspicious of @entity34 after he took large numbers of pictures -- photos that later turned up in the office of a deputy intelligence minister in @entity103 , the cable states			1
he stopped taking @entity34 's calls " and heard nothing more about the matter until he was visited by @entity112 anti-terror police january 14 , " according to the cable			1
according to the cable , @entity34 had tracked the @entity91 dissident at the same time he was making plans to assassinate the @entity1 dissident			1
the arrest by @entity0 police brought a halt to both plans			0
" @entity92 is a well - known figure both inside and outside @entity35 , and is an outspoken critic of the @entity35 regime , so it is unsurprising that the regime would want to keep a close eye on him , " the document states			2
" if , however , the regime has targeted @entity92 for assassination , as it appears to have done with @entity45 , it marks a clear escalation in the regime 's attempts to intimidate critics outside its borders , and could have a chilling effect on journalists , academics and others in the @entity138 who until recently felt little physical threat from the regime			0
" @entity45 said there was " no doubt " that the plot against him involved the @entity35 government			2
he said the motive was not only to kill him , but also to replace both @entity48 's website and its radio broadcasts with fakes in an attempt to hijack the movement			2
@entity34 ultimately pleaded guilty to a charge of solicitation of murder and was jailed for eight months			1
but the story does n't end there			0
after he was released from prison in 2010 , @entity34 applied for permission to leave the @entity14 while he was on five years ' probation and visit @entity35 for one month " to visit his dying father , " according to probation reports			1
his first application was denied , but a second request was granted a few weeks later on the condition that he return no later than october 27			0
he has not been seen in the @entity14 since			2
probation officials would not comment on the decision			0
meanwhile , another @entity166 -- a 71 - year - old @entity1 businessman named @entity168 -- was being held in an @entity35 prison			2
he had been jailed for more than two years after @entity35 authorities said he had given $ 200 to an @entity35 dissident group : @entity48 , the same group based in @entity0			2
@entity168 denied any association with @entity48			0
the money , he said , was to be given to a friend of a friend			0
within weeks of @entity34 's arrival in @entity35 , @entity168 walked out of @entity179			1
@entity168 said he believes there was " no connection " between his release and @entity34 's arrival			1
his attorney , a former @entity185 administration ambassador , @entity184 , said he does n't think there 's a link , either			0
" but it 's an interesting coincidence , is n't it ? " @entity184 said in a telephone interview			0
the @entity52 told @entity2 that there was no link between @entity34 's return to @entity35 and @entity168 's release			1
but back in @entity0 , @entity45 said there 's no doubt in his mind that there was a swap in which the @entity14 traded the man who orchestrated his attempted murder to @entity35 in exchange for the jailed businessman			1
" you give my man back			0
i give you your man back , " he said			0
