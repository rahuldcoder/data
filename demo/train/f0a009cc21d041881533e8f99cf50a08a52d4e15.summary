-- the shooting of 14 - year - old @entity2 in @entity4 's @entity3 has awakened the world to the dangers a resurgent @entity7 poses to the rights and safety of girls and women , particularly those who are human rights activists like @entity2			1
here is a question for tuesday 's presidential debate : will @entity2 's shooting prompt concrete steps to prevent more of such attacks , which potentially affect tens of thousands of girls and women -- and could seal the fate of an entire region ? late last week , as the teenager lay hooked to a ventilator , her recovery uncertain , the @entity7 pledged to come after her and her family again to punish her efforts to keep girls schools open			1
this is the mark of a committed foe of women 's rights , impervious to how its brutality has outraged the people of @entity4 and the globe			1
the @entity7 appears determined to extinguish women 's freedom at any cost			1
profile : @entity2 -- global symbol , but still just a kid the stakes are undeniable , yet the fate of women has been glaringly absent from nearly all high - profile discussions on the future of @entity43 and the wider region			1
when @entity47 heads of state met last may in @entity48 , it was not until protests were held by @entity50 and other groups that women were even included as full members of the @entity43 delegation			0
once invited into the room , @entity43 women reported that they were denied a significant role in summit deliberations or decisions			0
at last week 's vice presidential debate between vice president @entity62 and @entity64 rep. @entity63 , there was extensive discussion of @entity43 , but no mention of women			2
the issue has scarcely figured in president @entity70 's many statements and speeches about the region			2
as we approach the final debates of this campaign season , it is vital that the candidates answer the " @entity2 question			1
" this is not an easy problem to solve			0
as the @entity82 and its allies draw down , security responsibility is being transferred to @entity43 government forces without sufficient steps or resources to protect civilians			2
funding for development is tenuous , at best			0
institutions are weak , and outside influence by key governments and other actors is limited			0
in @entity3 , violence and harm to civilians is coming from a range of sources , including @entity82 drones in parts of @entity4			2
while their challenges differ , the rule of law in both @entity43 and @entity3 ranges from fragile to nonexistent			0
but women 's rights in @entity43 and @entity7 - influenced areas of @entity4 must not be written off as a lost cause			1
nor is it good enough to simply proclaim that something must be done			0
the @entity7 's siege on women puts the impressive rhetorical and legal commitments to women 's rights over the past few decades to perhaps its most visible and high - stakes test			1
it is not just about women			0
communities , local economies , indeed the entire region suffers if women are kept from contributing			2
before 9/11 , the @entity7 in @entity43 was notorious worldwide for its iron , repressive rule toward the country 's more than 17 million women			1
women were barred from education , professions and even from leaving their homes without being accompanied by a man			0
maternal mortality levels were among the world 's highest			0
in the decade since the @entity7 's overthrow in @entity43 , modest but key strides have been made			2
today , 3 million girls go to school , compared to virtually none under the @entity7			2
women make up 20 % of university graduates , and their numbers are growing			0
maternal mortality and infant mortality have declined , and 10 % of all prosecutors and judges are women , while there were none under the @entity7			2
securing and advancing these gains if the @entity7 grows in influence will be difficult			0
members of the @entity148 , a women 's rights consortium , express grave concern about the future , but also fierce determination not to see the clock rolled back			1
they have also joined @entity50 in outlining a specific action plan of steps that must be taken in @entity43 that may have relevance to @entity3 , as well			0
world : attack on @entity4 schoolgirl galvanizes @entity160 feeling one of the most important of these is a guarantee of significant , secure financial support controlled by women 's institutions and organizations in the region			1
development funds and economic activities are being funneled through @entity43 government ministries in an effort to build up those institutions			0
but unless local women 's organizations , including those serving rural areas , have unimpeded access to steady funds , the work and influence of dozens of organizations working to promote women 's education , health care , freedom from violence , economic opportunities and rights are in jeopardy			1
these groups and their leaders are the best bulwark against regression and deserve assured support			0
as internal deliberations and political maneuvering over the region 's future unfold , local actors , the @entity199 , outside partners , funders and the media must keep up the pressure to ensure that women are heard around the negotiating table and within government organs in the region			1
women 's rights must be codified in all negotiated instruments , and existing legal and constitutional guarantees strengthened and enforced			1
a wide range of governments and institutions globally will continue to hold sway over subjects like the handling of terrorist militants in the region			0
they need to use that influence to weigh in consistently on behalf of the region 's girls and women			1
critically , the number of women at all levels in national security and police forces must be increased through incentives , recruitment efforts and training to ensure that those serving in military and law enforcement roles do not suffer discrimination and can do their jobs			0
the @entity82 presidential candidates should endorse and @entity237 should enact legislation focused on addressing the threat posed by the @entity7 in @entity43 and parts of @entity4			1
this legislation should be tied to larger @entity82 policies and appropriations in relation to @entity43 and @entity3			2
a new law is the best way to ensure that sufficient funds are set aside and that women 's rights and their status are rigorously tracked and reviewed			1
having cited the betterment of women as one justification for its invasion of @entity43 11 years ago , the @entity82 needs to show that it is not turning its back on the region 's women			1
when @entity2 is well enough she should be the one to decide whether she wants such an effort dubbed " @entity2 's law			0
" it would be an apt naming			0
opinion : girl 's courage , @entity7 's cowardice it took a point - blank assassination attempt of a 14 - year old girl to get the world to pay attention to the threat to women from a resurgent @entity7			1
unless the shooting of @entity2 is news heard round the world , prompting sustained action in government offices , legislatures , newsrooms , @entity199 halls and public squares , her fate may foretell the lot of millions of other women and girls , and the destiny of an entire region			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity288 .			0

@entity288 : shooting of 14 - year - old girl shows resurgent , repressive @entity7
she says presidential candidates must answer : will they take action to push back ?
she says in talks on region 's future , women 's rights *chronically* left out
@entity288 : @entity82 must tie women 's rights to laws on appropriations , policies in region
