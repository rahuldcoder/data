-- no tricks here , just the treat : in honor of @entity5 , @entity3 is delving into the back story of one of " @entity10 's " more twisted @entity9 professors			1
on @entity3 's @entity14 website , the best - selling author has crafted a story about the life of @entity17 , whom fans will remember for her toad - like appearance , her hair bows and the gruesome way she chose to punish students			1
it turns out that @entity17 was inspired by a real person			0
there was a teacher of @entity3 's whom she " disliked intensely on sight , " and it seems the feeling was mutual			2
to be clear , this teacher was n't " the real @entity17 , " but her love of childlike accessories definitely inspired the character			2
" what sticks in my mind is her pronounced taste for twee accessories , " @entity3 says in an essay about the character			2
so although this teacher did n't " look like a toad , was never sadistic or vicious to me or anyone else , and i never heard her express a single view in common with @entity17 ... it is true to say that i borrowed from her , then grossly exaggerated , a taste for the sickly sweet and girlish in dress			0
" as for @entity17 's love of kittens , that was inspired by a former officemate of @entity3 's , whose adoration for small furry creatures was in contrast with " a lack of real warmth or charity			1
" new ' @entity10 ' character finds spotlight " @entity60 , who is one of the characters for whom i feel purest dislike , became an amalgam of traits taken from these , and a variety of sources , " @entity3 explains			1
" her desire to control , to punish and to inflict pain , all in the name of law and order , are , i think , every bit as reprehensible as @entity75 's unvarnished espousal of evil			0
" if you have an account on @entity14 , you can read the story there , or you can check it out on today.com			0
' @entity10 ' returns in a short story up next from the world of " @entity10 " are three movies that will follow the adventures of the author @entity86 years before his textbook " @entity88 " would be studied at @entity9			1
the first installment , also titled " @entity88 , " has @entity3 writing the screenplay and @entity91 on board to direct			0
that movie will arrive in 2016 , followed by two more installments in 2018 and 2020 .			0
