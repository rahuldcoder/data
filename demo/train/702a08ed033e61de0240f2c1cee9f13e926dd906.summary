-- the ripple effects of an alleged chemical attack in @entity3 are being felt across the globe			1
the rhetoric is ratcheting up with talk of punishing @entity3 , even though @entity3 denies using chemical weapons			1
allies of president @entity9 accuse the rebel forces of carrying out the chemical strike			0
meanwhile rebel forces , who also deny responsibility for the strike , say 1,300 people died in the attacks on the outskirts of @entity19			0
@entity0 correspondents and experts explain the different positions of some key nations involved in preparing for -- or warning against -- international military attacks on @entity3			2
@entity25 as the guarantor of international order the @entity25 has to do something after the large scale use of chemical weapons , and the @entity25 believes the @entity9 regime was responsible for the attacks			1
but it faces something of a quandary			0
launching the kind of large - scale campaign necessary to topple @entity9 would be lengthy and whoever replaces @entity9 could be even worse for @entity25 interests than @entity9 himself , given the fact that the most successful opposition groups on the ground are aligned with @entity44			2
so , the military intervention has to be large enough to punish @entity9 but not so large as to actually overthrow him			0
for @entity25 policymakers this is the least bad decision they likely feel they can make			2
for the @entity25 , @entity3 is a problem from hell @entity52 it is a long - time ally of @entity3 and wants to keep its influence			1
@entity52 says it is firmly opposed to the use of chemical weapons and supports the @entity59 chemical weapons inspectors			1
it wants the inspectors to be able to do their job and has warned against prejudging the results			0
why @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity52 stay loyal to @entity9 it also says it wants peace and suggests continuing with the second @entity68 on @entity3 , an initiative that is currently in doubt			1
" a political solution is always the only realistic means to resolve the @entity3 issue , " foreign minister @entity71 said			2
@entity64 it does n't want a repeat of @entity77 or @entity78			2
much has been said about @entity64 trying to protect the @entity3 government because of its military and economic interests in the country but @entity64 's key policy goal is blocking @entity25 efforts to shape the region			1
@entity64 does n't believe revolutions , wars and regime change bring stability and democracy			2
it often points to the @entity90 and the @entity25 - led war in @entity78 as evidence			2
sources : intercepts implicate @entity3 @entity64 also does n't trust @entity25 intentions in the region			1
it believes humanitarian concerns are often used an excuse for pursuing @entity25 's own political and economic interests			2
@entity64 has maintained influence throughout the conflict by using its veto in the @entity103 to shield @entity3 from international pressure			1
but it 's unclear if the @entity25 and its allies will rely on a @entity59 mandate to launch any military strike			2
@entity65 for @entity65 , @entity3 is a strategically key ally @entity65 's position , as outlined by foreign minister @entity110 and new president @entity111 , is that the @entity3 government is a victim of international plots			1
@entity65 believes the @entity116 and almost all @entity118 countries are in cahoots in an effort to implement regime change in @entity3			1
@entity65 says the main objective of this plot is to make the region safer for @entity125			0
@entity3 was also @entity65 's only @entity118 ally during its eight - year war with @entity78 , and @entity3 together with the @entity129 - controlled areas of @entity130 are considered to be @entity132 's first line of defense in case of an attack on @entity65 by @entity125 or the @entity116			1
so , @entity65 's interest in @entity3 is motivated by its longtime friendship , as well as @entity3 's strategic importance for @entity132			1
@entity65 says a @entity25 military strike would spark disaster @entity141 wants a proportionate response to the alleged chemical attack			1
prime minister @entity144 pushed for a vote in parliament on taking part in military action in response to the @entity3 attacks -- and lost			0
he now says it is important @entity141 has a " robust response to the use of chemical weapons , and there are a series of things that ( @entity141 ) will continue to do			1
" opposition leader @entity158 told the @entity159 : " @entity160 spoke for the @entity141 people who said they did n't want a rush to war , and i was determined we learned the lessons of @entity78 , and i 'm glad we 've made the prime minister see sense , " @entity168 leader @entity158			0
@entity144 had argued that the military response needs to be proportionate , legal and aimed at deterring the use of chemical weapons			1
@entity141 also tried to secure a @entity59 resolution on the matter			0
read @entity141 intelligence on chemical weapons @entity175 it wants to stay out of trouble			1
@entity175 wants a diplomatic solution but it was also host to a military meeting involving the @entity25 , @entity183 nations , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186			0
despite that meeting , @entity175 does not want to be seen as hosting the meeting where it is decided there will be intervention in @entity3			0
@entity175 feels that would put them in a dangerous situation with possible missile strikes from @entity3 and terror strikes precipitated by the @entity3 regime			0
it is an open secret that @entity184 is using @entity175 to smuggle weapons into @entity3 for the rebels			2
@entity175 says it is doing all it can to prevent that and does not want to inflame the situation in @entity3			0
@entity175 is feeling vulnerable , buffeted by the @entity90 and internal tensions such as allegations of official corruption and a less popular king , and it wants to stay out of trouble			0
@entity211 it favors a punishment strike			0
@entity211 has taken a very forward leaning position on punishing @entity3 for its apparent use of chemical weapons against its own citizens -- maybe that 's because of its colonial era ties to the @entity220 or because it sees its itself as a global force for good			1
but it 's still surprising as it comes under the leadership of @entity223 , who arrived in office declaring he was pulling @entity211 troops out of @entity226 immediately and was not going to be prone to military adventuring the way his predecessors were			0
now @entity223 is apparently reversing the position he 's held for months -- that any intervention in @entity3 would require @entity59 approval -- to indicate he is standing side - by - side with the @entity25 to join a new " coalition of the willing " which might go into action without @entity59 approval			1
" @entity211 is ready to punish those who gassed civilians , " @entity223 told his ambassadors gathered this week			0
and a senior diplomat told journalists that if there is a strike against @entity3 it would be as a sanction for the regime 's defiance of the international agreement to never use chemical weapons and not an attempt to change the course of the @entity3 civil war			1
@entity125 prime minister @entity254 says it is ready for any scenario and is warning @entity3 he will respond with force if @entity125 is attacked			0
@entity184 foreign minister @entity258 says the @entity3 government has lost its @entity118 identity and has called for " firm and serious " action			0
@entity0 national security analyst @entity262 , @entity0 senior international correspondent @entity263 , @entity265 bureau chief @entity264 , @entity267 correspondent @entity266 , senior european correspondent @entity268 , and @entity0 's @entity269 in @entity132 contributed to this report .			0

*fallout* from the use of chemical weapons is being felt in world *capitals*
@entity25 thinks @entity3 responsible but *retaliation* is a tricky balance
@entity64 does n't trust @entity25 intentions
@entity65 is supporting its strategically key regional ally
