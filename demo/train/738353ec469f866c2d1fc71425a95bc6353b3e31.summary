@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 squeezed through a gap between sections of a steel security fence 9 feet high , picked his way across a vacant lot infested with fire ants and climbed atop a rickety wooden platform			1
he stepped up and spoke into the microphone : " @entity12 is a good , good @entity12			2
" his words were amplified over a hardscrabble patch of earth wedged against a highway the locals call the inner loop			2
white plastic trash bins stood sentry against litter , but there was no one there to fill them			2
@entity3 , the first speaker to take the platform wednesday at the official " free speech zone " of the @entity28 , had an audience of just three -- two city workers and a reporter			1
it was shortly before 3 p.m. , and the place had been deserted since it opened five hours earlier			2
if a man -- be he a protester , a prophet or a pothead -- talks to a dozen trash cans in a vacant lot half a mile from a bustling political convention , does he make a sound ? without pausing to ponder the question , @entity3 simply turned and faced the massive traffic jam behind him on @entity45 , ironically in front of the @entity47			2
it may have been a captive audience , but at least it was an audience			2
" @entity12 is a good , good @entity12 , " he began again			2
and then , the generator powering the sound system shut down			2
a city worker fiddled with the contraption , shrugging , " i work for the @entity54 , so of course now i 'm the sound man			2
" @entity3 , meanwhile , carried on with a bullhorn , talking for nearly 40 minutes until the second speaker , also a street preacher , showed up late			2
@entity59 ' topic was " sodomy , abortion , fornication			1
" he taped up signs condemning " @entity64 " and " abhor - tion			0
" his @entity12 apparently was not a happy @entity12			0
" it is an abomination for a king to commit wickedness , " @entity59 preached , promising @entity12 's wrath against " a former president " who , he said , phoned " innocent grandmothers " in @entity1 and told them they did n't have to support a law that defined marriage as a union " between one man and one woman			0
" opinion : even vile funeral protests are free speech and so it went each day , until the rain came or the sun went down , whichever happened first			1
a preacher was followed by a speaker who wanted to legalize marijuana , who was followed by a group of atheists and agnostics , which was followed by a group of community singers			0
if at times it seemed like a single hand clapping in the dark , the speakers did not complain			0
@entity59 admits he was disappointed that no one was there to hear him preach , but he showed up all three days anyway			0
after using his allotted 30 minutes , he said , he 'd find a street corner " where there were lots of people " and start preaching again			0
" when you say you 're going to do something , you go ahead and do it , " he explained			0
" there was some benefit , to put the understanding on people			0
i decided i was just going to go ahead and preach , and if anyone hears it , use it , @entity116			0
" anarchists , occupiers and other protesters in @entity0 shunned the official speakers ' area , which they sneeringly called " the pen			1
" sure , some of them signed up			0
but they gave false agendas , never intending to show			0
" we are under the impression that the whole country is a free speech zone , " said @entity126 , a 26 - year - old organizer for @entity127			1
" we were bothered by the idea of any government - designated playground			0
" @entity135 , a lawyer from @entity136 , @entity137 , who co-chairs the @entity139 of the @entity140 , asked , " who 'd want to use it ? you 're talking to yourself			0
" her group works to push back against what it views as government attempts to stifle dissent			1
@entity135 keeps a photograph on her desk showing her with blackened eyes from rubber police bullets at the @entity152 in @entity153			0
" my rights to freedom of assembly are being violated , " complained anarchist @entity154 , a fixture at both of this year 's conventions who wears a boot on his head and also happens to be running for president			1
like most of the @entity0 protesters , including the cadre of 200 or so occupy regulars who camped at @entity167 , he took his case to the sidewalks and streets			1
who 's that protester with the boot on his head ? on tuesday , the first day of the @entity28 convention , about 100 protesters blocked the intersection across the street from " the pen , " demanding their free speech rights and entangling police in a two - hour standoff that ended peacefully when the skies opened up for the daily downpour			1
" at least they gave us some entertainment , " said a city worker overseeing the free speech area , which had to be one of the loneliest convention assignments			1
he passed the time reading a biography of @entity193			0
such was the state of free speech here during last week 's @entity28 convention , and at the @entity199 convention the week before in @entity200 , @entity201			1
the @entity202 of the @entity203 protects the right to freely practice one 's religion and publicly speak one 's mind without government constraint or interference			0
it also gives citizens the right to assemble and to air their grievances to their government			0
but the law remains unsettled on whether the government has the power to say where			0
the @entity219 has established guidelines to measure whether speech restrictions pass constitutional muster			1
the restrictions must be neutral and not based on content , and they must be specific ; they must serve a significant government interest , such as public safety ; and they must provide for alternative means of communication			0
the free speech zones are meant to be that alternative means of communication , but the @entity140 advises clients to avoid them and use the public sidewalks			1
the designation of free speech zones at political conventions and other large gatherings has been evolving for more than two decades , @entity135 said			1
in many instances , the free speech zones are set up far from the people whose attention the protesters seek			1
" it makes the protest invisible , " she said			0
" this has been a growing problem			0
" it began at the @entity28 in 1988			1
@entity246 set up a " designated protest zone " to prevent disruptions by anti-abortion group @entity249 and its opponents			1
the demonstrators objected to being confined to a " free speech cage , " but the practice continued during the 1992 and 1996 conventions			1
and , during the 1990s , free speech zones were designated in other public areas such as @entity258 's airport , which had issues with panhandling @entity260			1
both the @entity200 and @entity0 conventions were designated @entity262 , a category created in 1998			1
the massive protest against globalization during the 1999 @entity266 in @entity267 was the real game - changer for how police and municipalities respond to protest , @entity135 said			0
more than 40,000 protesters showed up and clashed violently with police in what became known as " @entity274			1
" it left behind indelible images of protesters blocking intersections and smashing storefront windows -- and police responding with volleys of pepper spray , tear gas and rubber bullets			1
the lawsuits that followed established that officials in @entity267 had a right to declare parts of the city off limits to everyone for security reasons , but were wrong to target just the protesters , @entity135 said			1
tightened security was noticeable at the 2000 political conventions in @entity296 and @entity153			1
city officials in @entity153 tried to file a sealed document justifying the lockdown , but a judge refused to look at it			0
attorneys challenged the remote location of the free speech zone and succeeded in moving the protest area to a lot directly across the street from the arena where the convention was held			1
a year later , the september 11 terrorist attacks changed the way @entity312 looked at security			0
federal agencies were rearranged in 2002 under the @entity315 , which determined which events should be considered @entity262 events			0
conventions leave atheists asking : what political party represents me ? the 2002 @entity322 in @entity323 were given that designation , along with the @entity325 and a handful other other high - profile events			1
the agency 's head now decides which events earn the designation			0
it puts the @entity331 in charge of security and the @entity334 in charge of intelligence during political conventions , international trade meetings and other events that could become targets for terrorists			1
over the years , the designation has come to apply to any event likely to attract mass protests			2
by 2004 , amped - up security and a heavy police presence had become a way of life at the conventions			2
protesters at the @entity28 convention in @entity351 were corralled into a " pen " with concrete walls and barbed wire and could not be seen by delegates			2
they responded by donning prisoner of war uniforms and marching in circles inside what they called " @entity360			0
" meanwhile , at the @entity199 convention in @entity365 , police on horses and motorized scooters herded protesters into " pens " made of orange mesh , said @entity369 , an attorney who represents some of the 1,800 people who were arrested			2
eight years after the convention , a class - action lawsuit alleging civil rights violations is still making its way through the federal courts			2
in @entity200 this year , just two people were arrested during the @entity377			1
the city 's downtown area was all but deserted -- except for the 4,000 cops in khaki fatigues -- giving the place all the ambiance of a third - world city after a military coup			0
in @entity0 , 25 people were arrested			1
police officers wore dark blue uniforms , which made them look more like cops			0
some @entity331 agents were in casual street dress , and the security perimeter was much larger because the event involved president @entity394			0
but in both cities , everyone was subjected to daily torrents from nature 's water cannon , which may have been more effective than anything police could come up with to dampen dissent			0
commenters divided over how free should free speech be			1

hardly anyone used the ' free speech zones ' at the conventions
the zones were set aside for protesters , others to voice their views
protesters complained zones were too far from the action in @entity200 , @entity0
free speech zones first established in 1988 in @entity246 amid protests over abortion
