@entity0 , @entity1 -- hours before the first primary vote of 2012 , @entity4 front - runner @entity3 tried to recover from a potential stumble monday as his presidential rivals intensified their attacks against him			1
voters in @entity1 's first - in - the - nation primary begin choosing their @entity4 candidates as early as 12 a.m. tuesday in two small towns -- @entity13 and @entity15 's location -- while polling stations in the rest of the state open at 6 a.m. and close as late as 8 p.m. et. the final day of campaigning saw @entity3 under fire for a comment about health insurance that quickly became fodder for criticism			1
asked about the issue in @entity26 , @entity1 , @entity3 said he wanted a person to be able to own his or her own policy " and perhaps keep it the rest of their life			1
" " that means the insurance company will have the incentive to keep you healthy			2
it also means if you do n't like what they do , you can fire them , " he said			2
" i like being able to fire people who provide services to me , " @entity3 added			1
" if someone does n't give me the good service i need , i want to say i am going to get somebody else to provide that service to me			2
" rival candidate @entity48 immediately seized on the comment as an indication of @entity3 's political nature			1
" it has become abundantly clear over the last couple of days what differentiates gov. @entity3 and me , " @entity48 said in @entity52			1
" i will always put my country first			2
it seems that gov. @entity3 believes in putting politics first			1
gov. @entity3 enjoys firing people			1
" the @entity63 released a derisive web video and called @entity3 " out of touch , " while the campaign of @entity68 gov. @entity67 looped @entity3 's words to make a cell phone ring tone that quickly went viral			1
@entity3 spent much of the rest of the day clarifying what he meant			1
at one point , @entity3 said he expected the comment to be taken out of context to try to hurt him , and his campaign issued a statement emphasizing he was talking about firing an insurance company , not people			1
" our opponents are taking gov. @entity3 's comments completely out of context , " said a statement by @entity81 , the campaign 's communications director			1
" gov. @entity3 was talking about firing insurance companies if you do n't like their service			1
that is something that most @entity92 agree with			2
" the latest twist in the @entity4 presidential race came on the eve of the first primary election a week after @entity3 won the @entity98 caucuses by just eight votes over former @entity101 sen. @entity100			1
with @entity3 in front in polls in @entity1 and @entity105 , the site of the first @entity107 state primary on january 21 , rivals stepped up their attacks by questioning the former @entity111 governor 's business background and electability			1
in @entity0 , former house speaker @entity113 tore into @entity3 's record in the private sector at the helm of @entity117			1
though @entity3 has said his work at the @entity120 - based private equity firm ultimately led to the creation of 100,000 jobs , @entity113 said @entity3 's pursuit of wealth exacted a huge cost			1
" what you have to raise questions about is , somebody goes out , invests a certain amount of money , say $ 30 million , takes out an amount , say $ 180 million -- six to one return -- and then the company goes bankrupt , " @entity113 said			1
" now , you have to ask a question : is capitalism really about the ability of a handful of rich people to manipulate the lives of thousands of other people and walk off with the money ? @entity143 is that , in fact , a little bit of a flawed system ? and so i do draw a distinction between looting a company , leaving behind broken families and broken neighbors , and leaving behind a factory that should be there			2
" @entity3 fired back that @entity113 and others were joining president @entity155 in attacking the free enterprise system			1
" as we 'll find out , free enterprise will be on trial , " @entity3 said			1
" i thought it was going to come from the president , from the @entity161 , from the left , but instead it 's coming from @entity113 and apparently others			1
" @entity113 had vowed earlier to run a positive campaign			1
but his tone has changed since his poll numbers plunged over the past month and he came in fourth in last tuesday 's @entity98 caucuses			2
" my conclusion after @entity98 was very simple , " he said monday in @entity0 in response to a question			0
" you could not engage in unilateral disarmament when 45 % of all the ads being run were attacks on me			0
to do that would be to get out of the race			0
" in @entity177 , @entity1 , @entity100 predicted the @entity4 field will narrow to a showdown between himself and @entity3 , " and we 'll win this race			1
" responding to a reporter 's question about his electability , @entity100 said the country is more likely to elect a " strong conservative " than a man who has " run ( previous elections ) as a liberal , a moderate , and a conservative			0
" @entity100 also cautioned voters to avoid the " establishment candidate			0
" " when we 've run establishment candidates , we 've lost , " he said , referring to veteran candidates in past elections who he said were nominated because of a perception it was their due after long careers			0
" we lost with @entity199 , we lost with @entity200			0
" @entity67 , meanwhile , made fun of @entity3 's comment over the weekend that he knows what it 's like to worry about getting a pink slip , questioning whether such a wealthy man as @entity3 would fear losing a job			1
campaigning in @entity105 , the site of the next primary on january 21 and the first @entity107 state to weigh in , @entity67 said people there were out of work " because of what @entity3 and @entity117 did			1
" @entity67 's decision to leave @entity1 for @entity105 on monday reflected his low poll numbers in the @entity1 and hopes to revitalize his campaign in the traditionally conservative @entity105			2
another candidate , @entity68 rep. @entity219 , said he was holding back on big spending in another upcoming key primary state -- @entity222			0
@entity219 , who has consistently been among the top three in polling , told @entity2 that he would focus instead on caucuses that come after @entity222 's primary on january 31			0
" we do n't have a big campaign planned there , but they 'll know we 're there , " @entity219 said in an interview			0
@entity222 was penalized by the @entity233 for moving its primary earlier than rules allowed , with its 99 delegates cut down to 50			0
still , @entity222 is a critically important state for the general election			0
asked about not focusing on @entity222 , @entity219 pointed out he had to prioritize spending his available campaign funding and had done well so far with a third - place finish in @entity98 and polls showing him contending for second place behind @entity3 in @entity1			1
" i think it tells you that we are realistic			0
that 's the way we approached @entity98 , we did pretty well there , and right now , polls are looking pretty good up here			0
so i think we 're being realistic , we should n't be acting like the government and spend money we do n't have , " @entity219 said with a chuckle			0
@entity219 's campaign chairman , @entity250 , said the focus after @entity105 will be the caucus states of @entity253 , @entity254 , and @entity255 , which offer a total of 98 delegates , and where @entity219 's aides hope to rack up enough to keep their campaign going all the way to the @entity261 in @entity262 , @entity222			0
@entity219 also made clear that if he does better than expected here in @entity1 and can raise more cash , his campaign might change course and compete more forcefully in @entity222			0
" we have to wait and see how things go , " @entity219 said			0
@entity48 , meanwhile , has made @entity1 his make - or - break contest			1
he skipped campaigning in @entity98 to spend all of his time stumping the @entity1 , starting monday in @entity270 in the north before working his way south to the coast			0
a new poll monday night by the @entity275 showed @entity48 's support rising , with 18 % of respondents supporting him -- good for second place behind the 37 % support for consistent front - runner @entity3			1
@entity219 was third at 17 % and @entity100 fourth with 11 % , followed by @entity113 at 10 % and @entity67 at 1 %			1
the poll of likely @entity1 primary voters had an error margin of 4 %			2
@entity3 and other @entity4 candidates also targeted @entity155 with sharp rhetoric monday			2
" i am very concerned that over the last three years you have seen , @entity92 , a very difficult time , " @entity3 told an afternoon event in @entity288 , @entity1			2
" this has not been a continuation of @entity92 's greatness from the past			0
i think it has been more of a detour than the destiny of @entity92			0
i actually think the president has tried , but he has failed			0
" at a luncheon with business leaders in @entity301 , @entity105 , @entity67 attacked the @entity155 administration for suing to block an immigration law recently enacted there , and he chided the @entity305 for intervening in the construction of a @entity308 facility in @entity309			0
" @entity105 , you are in a state of war with the federal government , " @entity67 said			0
in @entity1 , the other candidates were busy			0
@entity113 had seven planned events monday while @entity100 scheduled six			2
however , @entity113 canceled his final event because of what his campaign said were security concerns over protesters at the entrance and exits			2
@entity219 started monday by greeting a crush of voters in @entity0			0
" i wonder what the fire marshal would think , " he said as he shook hands			0
" let 's keep it a secret			0
" @entity219 , who has the backing of many libertarians , predicted he will do well in @entity1 because of his appeal among the 40 % of @entity333 who say they 're independent voters			0
" i think the people here in @entity1 are very independent - minded , and i have a strong appeal because i have challenged both the @entity4 and @entity161 leadership , and that means they want a message of cleaning house , " @entity219 said in @entity336			2
@entity2 's @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 and @entity348 contributed to this report .			0
