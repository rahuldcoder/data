-- " so , how many black friends do you have now ? " it 's a question i get asked a lot , ever since i set out five years ago to find out why i , your typical middle - class white person , had no black friends at all			1
i do have black friends now , actually			1
but i rarely offer that information when asked , because to ask white people how many black friends they have is to pose the wrong question			1
recently , a @entity14 poll came out showing that 40 % of white @entity15 have zero nonwhite friends , and only 20 % of white @entity15 have five or more nonwhite friends			1
people seemed shocked that the numbers were so bad			0
personally , i was surprised that they were so good			0
@entity15 remains a deeply segregated and divided country			2
even accounting for institutional and socioeconomic barriers , in the places we have the opportunity to integrateâ € ” the high school cafeteria , for instanceâ € ” we largely do n't			0
the @entity14 survey itself is misleading , lumping all minorities together under the vague heading of " nonwhite			1
" depending on what part of the country you live in ( e.g , anywhere but @entity38 or @entity39 ) , it 's not uncommon to have @entity41 or @entity42 friends			0
but the social divide between whites and those groups is more a function of the slow - rolling , generational process of immigrant assimilation			0
that is a wholly different phenomenon from the social divide between whites and blacks , which is the product of 400 years of slavery and segregation			0
that 's the social divide we should worry about , and if the poll had focused on that , the numbers would surely have been much worse			0
the reason why " how many black friends do you have ? " is such a terrible question is because it shows how we typically talk when we talk about race			1
even when we try to talk about race in a constructive way , we usually make black people the object of the sentence , rarely the subject			2
black friends are the things to be acquired to prove one is not racist			1
the way the question is asked accords black people no agency , nor does it reveal anything about the real character of the white person being queried			1
what you really want to know is not " how many black friends do i have ? " but rather , " have i become the type of individual that a black person might choose to be friends with ? " that 's a real question			1
poll a couple thousand white people with that and you might start to get some interesting answers , or at least some confused and befuddled looks			1
white people are products of their own whitewashed , sanitized environment			2
black people have been systematically excluded from white neighborhoods			1
black stories rarely surface in popular culture			0
the history of race in high school textbooks has been boiled down to a handful of bedtime stories about @entity104 and @entity105			0
try to tap into the average white person 's feelings on race and you wo n't necessarily find feelings of hate and antipathy			0
you just wo n't find much of anything , no fully formed or well - considered thoughts about race of any kind			0
there 's nothing really there			0
even white people who want black friends do n't know where to start			1
@entity15 's lack of integration would n't be such a big deal except for the fact that relationships and social networks are vital to economic advancement			2
even when programs like school busing and affirmative action give black people access to white spaces , when those people go to climb the social ladder there 's nothing there for them to grab onto , because there 's very little reciprocal effort coming from the other direction			1
it 's high effort and low reward			0
the result is that black people end up with integration fatigue			2
many black writers responded to the @entity14 poll with essays on why they did n't want white friends , and did n't need them			1
@entity153 friends were n't worth the bother			0
this is their prerogative , but ultimately , it 's to society 's disadvantage because white people control the access to , well , just about everything			2
if you do n't have white friends , you might have a decent job and a comfortable life , but all the doors of opportunity in this country are not open to you			2
" i may do well in a desegregated society , " the rev. @entity169 said , " but i can never know what my total capacity is until i live in an integrated society			1
" interracial friendships , social bonds across the color line , are a key factor in putting the sins of @entity15 's past behind us			1
but it 's not something that 's accomplished by white people knowing lots of black people			2
it helps if white people know how to be better white people			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			0

a recent @entity14 poll shows that 40 % of white @entity15 have zero nonwhite friends
@entity190 : i get asked a lot , " so , how many black friends do you have now ? "
he says some people see black friends as things to be acquired to prove one is not racist
@entity206 : @entity208 bonds across the color line are critical to a truly integrated society
