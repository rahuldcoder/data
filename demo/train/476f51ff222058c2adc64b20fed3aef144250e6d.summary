-- the choice of mobile as the medium for @entity0 's @entity5 - wide survey of @entity7 - related opinion shows how much has changed across the continent in the two decades between @entity7 's presidency , and his death			1
imagine attempting to do a phone survey in 1994 , when a country like @entity13 -- @entity5 's most populous -- had fewer than half - a - million landlines for its more than 100 million people , and mobile phones were mostly unheard of			1
( at this time of course land - lines were a staple across the developed world			0
) the dire state of technology was of course a reflection of wider -- political -- dysfunction			0
while multi-party democracy was taking root in @entity5 , only about five of @entity5 's 54 countries were not being ruled by dictators , most of whom did little more than loot the treasury and kill everyone perceived to be an enemy			1
indeed the circumstances of most @entity37 countries shared nothing in common with the peace and reconciliation and prospects of prosperity that the election of @entity7 symbolized in 1994			2
1994 was the year that @entity45 's dystopian essay , " the coming anarchy , " appeared in the @entity47			2
in it @entity48 wrote : ' " @entity50 is reverting to the @entity5 of the @entity51			2
it consists now of a series of coastal trading posts , such as @entity55 and @entity56 , and an interior that , owing to violence , volatility and disease , is again becoming , as @entity61 once observed , ' blank ' and ' unexplored '			0
" 1994 was also the year that @entity62 fell apart -- almost a million people hacked to death in a matter of months			0
fast forward to 2013 , and a lot has changed			0
a semblance of democracy has taken root in most of those places that were once a byword for anarchy			1
many of those wars have ended , and the same continent in which negative economic growth was a badge of honor now boasts of more countries on the list of fastest - growing economies in the world than any other			0
where once the continent was defined by its @entity87 's famous @entity86 cover in 2000 featured a child soldier clutching a rifle -- it is now more likely to be defined by those mobile phones that have made this survey possible			2
perhaps it is then easy to see why the majority of respondents in the survey -- 64 percent -- are more optimistic about the future than they were when @entity7 became president in 1994			1
then again it 's important to note that only a tenth of the surveyed population is older than 30			0
which means that most were not even teenagers yet when @entity7 became president			2
and you should know that across the world , the millennial generation ( as those born post- 1980 are known ) , armed with their mobile phones and social networking , seem to be an unshakably optimistic lot			0
why that is so , is up for debate -- there are any number of articles on the @entity117 asking the question : " why are @entity119 so optimistic ? " a 2013 @entity121 poll found that only a quarter of @entity124 18 to 29 year olds believe their standard of living is declining			0
in the @entity0 - @entity128 poll , even fewer -- 15 percent -- failed to succumb to optimism			1
overwhelming as it is , however , that optimism fails to mask the depth of @entity5 's subsisting problems : the facts of jobless growth and rising inequality ; that democracy is still largely a theoretical principle and government accountability mostly a mirage			1
it 's a good thing the poll asks what respondents think is the biggest challenge their country is dealing with			1
the predictability of the responses -- 37 percent of respondents think corruption is @entity5 's biggest challenge , 23 percent think its rising inequality , 16 percent think its poverty -- paints , in my opinion , a truer picture than the confident optimism about the future			1
not much has happened in the last few years to inspire much confidence that there will be a marked improvement in the coming years			0
youth unemployment in @entity7 's @entity5 is one of the highest in the world			1
and it 's a similar story across the continent : fantastic economic growth jostling with technological revolutions everywhere you turn , but very little benefit trickling down to the lives of ordinary people			2
in truth @entity7 being alive or dead will mean very little to the daily realities of most people			0
he will of course continue to be a towering icon of moral strength , the face of one of the most outstanding feats of political freedom in recent human history			1
but for economic freedom , the battle continues , in @entity5 and elsewhere , and the end is nowhere in sight			1
which is perhaps why citizens will be needing all the optimism they can lay their minds on			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0

the choice of mobile as a medium for @entity0 's survey shows how things have changed , says @entity193
a semblance of democracy has taken root in many places that were once a byword for anarchy
the fact that 37 percent think corruption is @entity5 's biggest challenge is more telling that general optimism
@entity7 will remain a towering icon of moral strength , but for economic freedom , the battle continues
