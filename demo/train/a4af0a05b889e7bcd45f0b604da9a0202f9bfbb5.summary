-- for many @entity3 , the passing of @entity2 means it 's time to buckle down on holiday shopping — but for cinemaphiles it 's time to go to the movies			1
as studios seek to capitalize on the availability of audiences during the holidays and to get their films released , at least in limited distribution , in time to be eligible for the @entity18 ( nominations for which are due jan. 3 , according to the @entity19 ) , movie theaters tend to fill up with some of the most @entity18 - friendly fare of the whole year			1
here 's your super-condensed guide to which holiday - season movies are shaping up to be contenders , including a lesser - known film that 's already a proven winner			1
movie : the @entity27 : an @entity28 in theaters : dec. 14 directed by : @entity30 starring : @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 @entity37 : @entity38 has announced that the movie based on the @entity41 classic is vying for nominations for @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , best actor ( @entity31 ) , @entity47 ( @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 ) , best supporting actress ( @entity48 ) , @entity49 and pretty much every technical award possible			2
if @entity27 lives up to the precedent set by the @entity52 ( which finished off with a 11 @entity18 , including @entity43 and @entity44 , for @entity54 ) , that long list of goals does n't seem so outlandish			1
the movie promises an epic quest plot and the visual beauty we expect from @entity52 movies — plus even more of @entity36 ' impressive but not - yet - @entity18 - winning motion - capture acting work as @entity63			1
movie : @entity65 in theaters : dec. 19 ( limited ) directed by : @entity67 starring : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 @entity37 : @entity71 is also putting forward @entity65 — the movie about the hunt for and eventual capture of @entity75 , the release date for which was pushed back after some said it would boost president @entity78 's chances in the election — for almost every award for which it 's eligible , including @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity82 , best actress and @entity47 ( with seven different actors to be considered for that last category )			1
the story of how the movie was made involves confidential secrets and top - level access , but the story it tells is even more extreme : @entity92 plays a @entity94 operative who is convinced that she 'll be the one to bring down @entity75 , and the screenplay packs years of complicated diplomacy and tracking into a tight and suspenseful package			2
@entity67 surprised many in 2010 when her the @entity99 beat out @entity100 and took home the @entity43 and @entity103 awards , but it would n't too much of a shock if she did it again			0
movie : the impossible in theaters : dec. 21 directed by : @entity109 starring : @entity110 , @entity111 @entity37 : this movie tells the true story of a family torn apart when the 2004 tsunami struck during their family vacation to @entity118 and how they found each other again			0
it 's a tearjerker with an impressive backstory , and director @entity109 could pull out a nomination , but the more likely recipients of @entity18 nods would be the two stars — particularly @entity110 , playing the mother whose quest made the impossible possible and on whose survival the story hinges			1
the special effects that bring the tsunami to life , creating a wall of water and debris that batters the characters , may also be found worthy of recognition			0
movie : @entity139 in theaters : dec. 25 directed by : @entity141 starring : @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 @entity37 : @entity148 wants @entity18 members to consider the film version of the classic stage musical ( and even more classic @entity153 novel ) about 19th - century @entity155 student revolutionaries and a convict - turned - mayor for @entity43 , director , actor ( @entity143 ) , supporting actor , supporting actress , @entity45 , technical awards and @entity162 ( for " suddenly , " the token new song that most stage - to - film musicals tack on )			1
the movie has been getting lots of attention for the groundbreaking tactic of actually letting the actors sing live rather than having them lip sync to a recording of their own voices — visually and vocally , it 's a winning combination that leaves the movie with strong chances in the major all - around categories			2
movie : @entity178 in theaters : dec. 25 directed by : @entity180 starring : @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 @entity37 : @entity180 takes on history in his latest movie , featuring @entity184 as a slave named @entity190 whose freedom is bought in exchange for his services as a bounty hunter			0
@entity181 plays the plantation owner who still has @entity190 's wife in his possession			0
the movie won a screenwriting award at the @entity200 and could do so again			0
the actors are all @entity18 - level performers — best picture 's not out of the question either			1
movie : @entity205 in theaters : dec. 19 directed by : @entity207 starring : @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 @entity37 : so @entity205 is n't getting the mega advertising push that the other holiday movies will			1
and it 's been out , at festivals , since may			0
while it does hit some theaters dec. 19 in a limited release , it may take a while for it to get to your town			2
still , do n't underestimate this one			0
the movie — about an elderly couple whose love is strained by illness — premiered at @entity226 , where @entity207 won the @entity227 and the movie won major acclaim from critics			0
even though the film is in @entity155 , expect it to break free from the foreign - language category			2
( and even if you do n't get a chance to see @entity205 before the year ends , check out the parody @entity207 account on @entity236 for some @entity226 - inflected laughs ... and only a modicum of spoilers			2
