-- president @entity1 on saturday called for bipartisan legislation to extend unemployment insurance , an all - important benefit for the longtime out - of - work			1
" just a few days after @entity9 , more than 1 million of our fellow @entity7 lost a vital economic lifeline -- the temporary insurance that helps folks make ends meet while they look for a job , " @entity1 said in his weekly address			2
" republicans in @entity16 went home for the holidays and let that lifeline expire			1
and for many of their constituents who are unemployed through no fault of their own , that decision will leave them with no income at all			0
" the insurance expired last week when lawmakers failed to continue a 2008 recession - era federal law providing nearly a year of benefits , paid for by @entity7 taxpayers , that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out			1
@entity16 will start the new year with an old fight : whether to extend jobless benefits for 1.3 million long - term unemployed			1
@entity1 urged lawmakers to restore the benefits			2
" right now , a bipartisan group in @entity16 is working on a three - month extension of unemployment insurance -- and if they pass it , i will sign it			1
for decades , @entity41 and @entity42 put partisanship and ideology aside to offer some security for job - seekers , even when the unemployment rate was lower than it is today			1
instead of punishing families who can least afford it , @entity41 should make it their @entity51 's resolution to do the right thing , and restore this vital economic security for their constituents right now , " @entity1 said			2
@entity42 argue the program is needed to sustain economic recovery and offer a lifeline to those struggling to keep their heads above water financially			1
@entity41 counter the benefits are an economic drain and a disincentive to looking for work			1
the @entity65 estimates continuing them for another year will cost about $ 26 billion			0
many @entity41 , including potential 2016 presidential candidate sen. @entity66 , @entity67 , have long insisted that the @entity69 - era extension of emergency federal benefits deters job hunting and is unnecessary as the economy rebounds and unemployment declines			1
@entity1 said denial of the security provided by the benefits " is just plain cruel			0
" " we 're a better country than that			0
we do n't abandon our fellow @entity7 when times get tough -- we keep the faith with them until they start that new job , " he said			0
" what 's more , it actually slows down the economy for all of us			0
if folks ca n't pay their bills or buy the basics , like food and clothes , local businesses take a hit and hire fewer workers			0
that 's why the independent @entity65 says that unless @entity16 restores this insurance , we 'll feel a drag on our economic growth this year			1
and after our businesses created more than 2 million new jobs last year , that 's a self - inflicted wound we do n't need , " @entity1 said			2
senate majority leader @entity101 , @entity102 , plans to hold the first vote toward renewing the benefits on monday , the day the @entity100 returns from its holiday recess			0
it will be a procedural test of a proposal to stretch the program another three months			0
democrats do not yet know whether they have enough @entity41 support to get the 60 votes necessary to clear the procedural hurdle , a senior leadership aide told @entity0			2
the fight has played out repeatedly over the past few years as the two parties clashed in often dramatic showdowns rife with fiery rhetoric and lengthy filibusters .			0
