@entity0 -- when artist @entity3 exhibited work in @entity0 last year , she hoped the piece would prove a talking point			2
but when ultra-conservative @entity9 @entity8 took an interest in her installation at a spring arts festival in @entity15 's capital , the reaction was much stronger than she bargained for			1
deeming a number of artworks in the exhibition heretical , @entity17 extremists vandalized the gallery , issued death threats to @entity3 and fellow exhibitors , and rioted in the streets in some of the most serious unrest since the 2011 revolution			1
along with fellow artist @entity28 , she now faces charges of harming public order and morals through her work -- charges that could see them sentenced to up to five years in prison if convicted			0
" i never imagined this could happen , not even in my worst nightmares , " said @entity3			0
the clash highlights growing tensions between liberal and religious forces over the limits on free speech , as they jostle to define the identity of the new @entity15 following the ouster of dictator @entity45 @entity44 in january 2011			1
one of the pieces that triggered the protests was @entity3 's installation " @entity49 ... ( anyone who has not ... ) , " which featured mannequins of traditionally veiled women , positioned amongst a pile of stones , with text written on both the female figures and the stones			2
the work , @entity3 told @entity1 , was about " trying to show two different ways to practice @entity60 -- one spiritual , and one closed			1
" but some of the protestors , alerted to the exhibition by postings on social media , interpreted the artwork as implying traditionally dressed women should be stoned			2
@entity28 's artwork , which was also singled out by the protesters as indecent , depicted a line of ants emerging from a child 's schoolbag to spell the word " @entity76			1
" read more : inside @entity15 's former dictator 's palace -- fake diplomas , sports cars , and a stuffed leopard after festival organizers refused a request from the aggrieved @entity9 to remove the offending works from view , thousands of hardliners took to the streets , leaving the walls of the gallery scrawled with graffiti reading : " non-believers have no place in @entity15 " and " you are enemies of @entity94			1
" this is not the only flashpoint @entity15 has seen			2
in late 2011 , religious conservatives also protested against a @entity0 television station and attacked a theater for playing films deemed un-islamic , while there have also been reports of conservatives attempting to enforce @entity60 dress codes			1
the group behind the protests are the @entity9 -- ultra-conservative @entity8 who are becoming an increasingly strident political force across the @entity110 world in the wake of the @entity112			0
having suffered repression under the rule of @entity44 , they now seek a greater voice in the new @entity15 , pushing to impose a stricter vision of @entity60 than that championed by the moderate @entity119 party which runs the interim government			1
one @entity9 cleric , @entity121 , told @entity1 he believed art should promote religious virtue , and he had opposed the exhibition because it contained nudity			2
" we are against violence , and for dialogue , " he said			0
" but we act in response to provocation , and i consider nudity to be violent			0
" read more : @entity110 women take a stand on sexual violence but other @entity15 , particularly those of a secular , liberal persuasion , hold a different view of their country 's future			1
while @entity60 has always been the main religion in @entity15 , politics have long been secular			1
@entity142 , a 52 - year - old painter from @entity0 , says the views of those who value freedom of expression , artistic or otherwise , must also be taken into account as the country attempts to rebuild itself			0
" i respect them , " @entity142 said of the @entity9			0
" but they have to respect me and the other people who think different			0
" @entity15 's interim government says it is against censoring art -- but that a red line exists when it comes to blasphemy			1
a proposal has been tabled to criminalize blasphemy in @entity15 's new constitution , due later this year			1
" even in the most modern societies , there are limits -- whether it 's security or religious , " culture minister @entity161 told @entity1			0
" in order to protect freedoms , we need to set these limits			0
" meanwhile , @entity3 is waiting to see what will become of the charges against her , with international groups such as @entity174 calling on @entity15 authorities to drop them			2
the charges were being used to stifle the freedom of expression of " artists , journalists , and other citizens who voice criticism of religion , " @entity176 , a @entity0 - based researcher at @entity174 , told @entity1			0
but @entity3 said she would continue to resist any attempt to impose a new culture of censorship in @entity15			2
" freedom of expression is not something we invented , its limits are well known , " she said			0
" but the sacred is something personal , and no one should intervene in that			0

art has become a target for hardline @entity60 in @entity15 after the revolution
*salafists* rioted last year over an exhibition containing artworks they considered heretical
@entity15 artists and liberals say they will not be cowed by an *intolerant* minority
@entity15 's moderate @entity17 government is attempting to walk a line between the two
