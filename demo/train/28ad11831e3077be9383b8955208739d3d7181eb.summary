-- @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 grabbed the headlines in 2014 , but there is another huge story that should not be overlooked			1
historians could look back on this year as the beginning of feminism 's third wave			1
the year was momentous for feminism			0
for the first time , rape victims and their supporters emerged from the shadows in significant numbers and started naming names -- to significant effect			1
women , their voices amplified by social media and with the support of a small but growing cohort of men , have been exposing and shaming venerable @entity26 institutions such as the @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity30 colleges , and the entertainment icon @entity32			1
first wave feminists won the right to vote			0
the second wave got us the right to work			0
but even with those advances , women have remained fundamentally restricted by the threat and terrible secret of sexual assault			0
this year , emboldened and connected by social media , college women formed a powerful grassroots movement that led to universities such as @entity47 being publicly named and shamed for not addressing women 's rape reports			1
they brought the issue of campus sexual assault into the @entity52 , where @entity53 became the first president to use the words " sexual violence			1
" the @entity57 released a list of universities under investigation for mishandling sexual violence cases , often letting even repeat predators off with barely a slap on the wrist			2
these young women had been silent until social media enabled them to come together , even though thousands of miles apart , share debilitating secrets and then act with the confidence that safety in numbers provided			1
last week 's back - pedaling on the @entity72 article about an alleged gang rape at a @entity75 fraternity house is an unfortunate example of reporting gone wrong			1
but it is also a teachable moment about why feminism 's third wave is so important : we must make it easier for more women to put their names and faces on their accusations and eradicate the stigma and fear that silences victims			1
only when these stories come fully out of the shadows can we assess their validity and see justice done			0
@entity32 's accusers , with their remarkably similar stories of being drugged and assaulted , were also " heard " for the first time in 2014 , even though many had individually come forward in the pages of national media years ago			1
@entity101 , a @entity102 artist and mother who was one of @entity32 's early accusers , told me that being a rape victim " is the most shameful , scary , intimidating , filthy place to live			1
it is a place of darkness and fear			0
" the bravery of the @entity32 accusers and the college women alone is not the only encouraging sign			1
the public revelations of domestic violence rocking the @entity27 , amplified by an elevator video of @entity117 cold - cocking his fiancee , are another			2
the @entity27 dropped the ball on punishing @entity117 but now is being shamed into paying attention to behavior that it used to ignore and enable			2
men are starting to get it			0
in an article after the latest @entity32 scandal , the essayist @entity124 wrote that he regretted not having paid attention to the women in 2008 , when he penned a seminal piece on @entity32			2
" i have never been raped , " @entity124 wrote			0
" but i have , several times as a child , been punched / stomped / kicked / bum - rushed while walking home from school , and thus lost my body			0
the worst part for me was not the experience , but the humiliation of being unable to protect my body , which is all i am , from predators			0
" every alleged image or videotape of a rape and beating that goes viral , every woman coming forward with a @entity32 story and every college freshman reporting her rapist form a collective alarm bell waking up the silent majority of @entity26 who would never call themselves " feminist " and yet who abhor sexual violence against women			1
rape culture holds all women down , whether soldiers or @entity156 or college freshmen or high school girls who drank too much out in blue - collar @entity159 or backcountry @entity160			2
my generation of women , who came of age in the 1980s , did not really carry forward the banner of feminism			2
we took advantage of the gains of the 1970s , getting good jobs and having children and then got so busy having it all that we had no time left over			0
and it was terribly important to fit in , to be one of the guys , to fly under the radar as women			0
the last thing we wanted was to be labeled as victims , to wear the humiliation of being prey			0
i 'm in awe of the young women on campuses who have stood up and made it ok to tell the world what happened to them , in their dark places , in the dark of night			0
thanks to their courage , more and more @entity26 are understanding every day that the shame of sexual assault is a burden that belongs on the predators , not the prey .			2

@entity201 : 2014 marked start of feminism 's third wave -- rape victims speaking out
she says social media , support of men , *including* president , brought campus rape to fore
she says @entity32 , @entity27 , @entity75 cases show need to erase stigma of women naming *attacker*
@entity220 : women in ' 80s sat out feminism ; new wave emboldened to shame predators
