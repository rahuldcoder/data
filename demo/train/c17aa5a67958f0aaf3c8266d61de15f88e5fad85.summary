@entity1 , the @entity2 correspondent at the center of a discredited october 27 report about the attack on the @entity7 diplomatic compound in @entity8 , @entity9 , is taking a leave of absence from work , the network said tuesday			1
@entity14 's longtime producer , @entity15 , is also taking time off			2
@entity2 suggested that the leaves of absence were punitive measures for the shortcomings in the @entity8 report , which has stung the reputations of both @entity14 and the program that televised her report , " 60 minutes			1
" with the staff announcements on tuesday and the release of an internal review , @entity2 tried to demonstrate that it has figured out what went wrong with its @entity8 report and taken steps to stop similar mistakes in the future			1
" the ' @entity35 ' journalistic review is concluded , and we are implementing ongoing changes based on its results , " a @entity33 spokeswoman said tuesday			2
' we were wrong ' : @entity2 's @entity1 apologizes for @entity8 report but the network declined to comment further on what changes were being implemented or on when @entity14 might return to work			1
@entity14 has not talked publicly about the @entity8 report since she apologized for it on november 10 , and it looks unlikely that she will talk anytime soon ; although she had been scheduled to host a high - profile fund - raising dinner for the @entity50 on tuesday night , the committee says her colleague @entity51 , the anchor of the " @entity52 , " is going to fill in for her			1
@entity53 , the chairman of @entity33 and the executive producer of " @entity35 , " said in an internal memorandum that he asked @entity14 and @entity15 to take leaves of absence			1
@entity53 said he , not @entity14 , was ultimately responsible for the mistakes associated with the october 27 report			2
" i pride myself in catching almost everything , but this deception got through and it should n't have , " he said			0
the exceptionally rare steps by @entity2 were applauded by @entity63 , the liberal media monitoring group that was among the first to criticize @entity14 's conclusions about @entity8			1
" from the start of this controversy , @entity63 has demanded that @entity2 review the flawed ' 60 minutes ' report and take appropriate action			2
today , the network has done that , " the group 's chairman , @entity69 , said in a statement			0
" we hope this serves as a lesson learned to @entity2 about the danger of misinformation			0
" the missteps in the report stemmed from an interview with @entity82 , a security contractor who was in @entity8 on the night of the assault , which left four @entity7 dead , including ambassador @entity84			0
@entity82 claimed in the interview that he was present at the compound , but that account contradicted what he had previously told the @entity89 , the @entity90 and his own employer			0
' we were wrong ' : @entity1 apologizes for @entity8 report @entity2 executives have said that they did n't know the details of the government interviews of @entity82 but did know that he 'd told his employer a different story			1
" this crucial point -- his admission that he had not told his employer the truth about his own actions -- should have been a red flag in the editorial vetting process , " said @entity98 , the head of standards and practices for @entity2 , in the network 's internal review , which was shared with employees on tuesday			1
@entity98 also faulted the " @entity35 " staff with keeping its interview to itself â€” something that outside critics said weeks ago when questions about the report were first raised			0
" the fact that the @entity89 and the @entity90 had information that differed from the account @entity82 gave to ' @entity35 ' was knowable before the piece aired , " @entity98 wrote			0
" but the wider reporting resources of @entity33 were not employed in an effort to confirm his account			0
it 's possible that reporters and producers with better access to inside @entity89 sources could have found out that @entity82 had given varying and conflicting accounts of his story			0
" @entity133 source : @entity8 contractors seem to contradict @entity136 chief			0

@entity1 and producer @entity15 agree to leave suggested by @entity2
leaves of absence come at the end of an internal review of their @entity8 report
the " @entity35 " report centered on a source who gave contradictory accounts
@entity14 apologized for the october report earlier this month
