-- when my publisher first suggested the title for my new book , " @entity5 " i bristled			0
being called a spy is a pet peeve shared by everyone i know in the intelligence community , after all			0
so , to set the record straight , @entity11 officers are not spies â € ” a spy is someone who commits espionage against his own country			1
@entity20 quibbling aside , the primary purpose of the @entity11 's clandestine service is to identify and then to recruit sources of intelligence			1
done well , this yields the sort of information that can change policy , shape strategy , and even save lives			0
but individuals who have access to the sort of information sought by the @entity11 are few and far between			1
individuals who have both the access and a willingness to provide said information to the @entity38 government are even rarer still , and this dearth of suitable candidates presents constant challenges			0
it can be said , then , that the @entity11 knows a thing or two about finding and recruiting the right people			1
so , although the @entity11 's version of recruitment may involve higher stakes and greater risks than the corporate version , there are still business lessons to be learned from the recruitment practices used in the clandestine world			1
here are a few : know the gaps every case officer in every posting around the globe has a deeply ingrained sense of mission , and that mission is spelled out in the form of requirements			0
in a nutshell , these are the ever - changing and rank - ordered intelligence gaps in need of filling			0
issues related to terrorism top everyone 's list , of course , as do a number of other global topics			2
but other requirements may be specific to the region in which the officer works , or even the officer 's specific area of expertise			0
a case officer in one part of the world may concentrate on long - range missile programs , whereas an officer on the other side of the globe may focus more on political reporting			0
these requirements guide @entity11 officers during every networking opportunity , every meeting and every chance encounter , helping them determine if and how to proceed			1
be honest , are the leaders of your organization similarly aware of the skill gaps impacting your company 's success ? and , if so , are they prepared to seek out those skills during every networking opportunity ? too often , recruiting is viewed as little more than a list of current job openings managed exclusively by the @entity102 department			0
but just imagine being able to tap into the collective social and business networks of every employee in your organization			0
the pool of talent that such a meta - network can yield has the added benefit of built - in screening by the people you already trust			2
identify your targets the intelligence gaps i just mentioned are also used in a more active way â € ” to initiate and drive targeting efforts			2
more specifically , when critical information is needed , teams of officers from both the analytical and the operational sides of the @entity11 set about identifying exactly who might be able to provide the answers and fill the gaps			1
these individuals are then systematically targeted for recruitment			2
corporate recruitment practices , on the other hand , tend to be passive : a job vacancy is posted , and respondents are screened			1
even relatively proactive efforts such as attendance at job fairs or college recruiting events rely on job seekers making the first move			2
instead , consider adopting targeting techniques from the @entity11 to identify those individuals who are instrumental to your competitors ' success			1
these are the people you want on your team ; these are the people you want to hire			0
before you raise an ethical objection to " stealing " employees , remind yourself that your competitors will quite cheerfully steal your customers			0
assess motivation for every spy who demands an exorbitant sum in exchange for sensitive data , there 's another who would do it for free simply because he believes that it 's the right thing to do			0
there are as many reasons for spying as there are spies , and it 's a @entity11 officer 's job to understand and cater to specific motivations			1
the recruitment approach that would appeal to someone who yearns for the sense of adventure and intrigue afforded by working with the @entity11 would almost certainly fail to persuade an individual motivated by more ideological matters			1
the business world would be well served by the same degree of sensitivity to specific motivations , especially when it comes to critical skill sets			2
everyone knows that salaries are negotiable , but the corporate world is still largely reluctant to negotiate other terms of employment			0
we 've acknowledged the benefits and the appeal of flexible work hours and conditions for decades now , but it 's the rare organization that uses its full arsenal of motivating forces to lure the top talent from their competitors			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			1

@entity11 recruitment techniques can be applied to corporate life
be proactive and do *n't* be *afraid* to poach talent , says @entity196
identify different motivations to recruit top talent
