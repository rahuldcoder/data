@entity0 has heard all the concerns about @entity2 , its digital headset expected to hit the market by the end of the year			1
they 've heard people 's fears they 'll be secretly recorded by a glass - wearing creeper			2
they know somebody 's going to be stupid and drive while using them			0
and , yes , they know that some people might think you 're a " @entity16			0
" so , now , they 're serving up a list of " do 's " and " don'ts " to avoid those awkward moments and get the most out of what may be the most high - profile entry in the emerging wearable - tech market			2
on its website for @entity2 , @entity0 has posted advice for testers in its current explorer program and , presumably , the folks who will be entering the world of @entity2 when the headset goes on sale to the public			1
here 's a breakdown of some of our favorites			0
do : ask for permission " standing alone in the corner of a room staring at people while recording them through @entity2 is not going to win you any friends , " @entity0 says			1
" the @entity44 camera function is no different from a cell phone so behave as you would with your phone and ask permission before taking photos or videos of others			1
" fears about privacy around @entity44 have been one of the device 's biggest hurdles on its path toward acceptance			1
restaurants have banned them , and complete strangers have confronted testers because of the device 's ability to shoot photos and video			1
easing those fears will be important for @entity0 as it moves forward			1
do n't : be creepy or rude ( aka a " @entity16 " ) yes , @entity0 itself used the derogatory term " @entity16 " ( although it 's been massaged into a description of bad behavior , as opposed to its broader meaning as a slur , voiced by some critics , used to describe anybody wearing the headset )			1
this is the flip side of the first entry			0
" if you 're asked to turn your phone off , turn @entity2 off as well , " @entity0 writes			2
" breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about glass and will ruin it for other explorers			0
" do : take advantage of the @entity2 voice commands this is the real advantage of a lot of wearable tech. you do n't have to fiddle around with it like you do a smartphone			0
but we mostly just like @entity0 's hypothetical scenarios here : " @entity2 can free your hands up to do other things like golfing , cooking , or juggling flaming torches while balancing on a beach ball			2
" do n't : glass out @entity0 is pushing @entity2 as a way of getting quick updates or performing quick actions , as a complement to other mobile devices instead of a replacement			1
" if you find yourself staring off into the prism for long periods of time you 're probably looking pretty weird to the people around you , " the post reads			0
" so do n't read @entity111 on @entity2			0
" do : use screen lock once you 've customized your glass , bad guys who get their hands on it will have access to your e-mail and other sources of personal information , just as if they 'd snagged your phone or laptop			0
do n't : wear it and expect to be ignored @entity0 is treating its @entity125 ( many of whom forked over $ 1,500 for the right to say they were first ) as walking billboards for the product			1
they do n't want those billboards acting like ... well ... @entity132			0
" if you 're worried about someone interrupting that romantic dinner at a nice restaurant with a question about @entity2 , just take it off and put it around the back of your neck or in your bag , " says @entity0			2
around the back of your neck ? that sounds like a fashion faux pas -- and another " do n't " to us .			0

@entity0 is offering tips for @entity44 *etiquette*
company *encourages* users to ask permission to shoot photos , video
also ? do n't be a " @entity157 , " it says
