warned of the potential increase of dengue fever and other climate - sensitive illnesses , @entity1 saw an almost - seven decade streak of being dengue fever - free end			1
in the past week , at least 55 people have become ill with dengue fever , confirming fears that the fever , last seen in 1945 , is back			1
the cases have one thing in common -- those affected all appear to have visited @entity16 , one of @entity19 's largest outdoor spaces , and all have complained of mosquito bites			0
following fumigation last week , the health ministry and @entity19 metropolitan government trapped and analyzed about 100 mosquitoes from the park and , found strains of the virus , prompting authorities to close large parts of the park as of thursday afternoon			2
this week , two models , @entity35 , 20 , and @entity36 , 25 , who were filming for " @entity37 , " a variety show , in the park , were struck down with the virus , the @entity33 newspaper reported			0
the dengue outbreak in @entity1 has seen victims from the age of 10 to those in their 70 's			1
while most people recover within a week , the disease can create discomfort and and can , in rare cases , cause death			2
the disease , which is mainly transmitted by a type of mosquito ( aedes aegypti ) , is found in tropical and subtropical climates worldwide			2
symptoms include fever , severe headache , rashes and pain behind the eyes , muscle and joint pain			0
harrowing experience by all accounts , contracting dengue fever is a harrowing experience			1
@entity66 , formerly of @entity0 and now a @entity68 - based communications consultant , contracted dengue while on vacation in @entity71 in july			0
back in @entity68 after a few days , @entity66 found himself unusually lethargic in the afternoon			0
the following day he had a fever and a temperature , which got progressively worse			0
" by the onset of that evening i had appalling pain in my joints , really achy , weak limbs and just a sense that i was n't well at all , " he said			0
" this was unlike anything else , it was so debilitating			0
" eventually , he was admitted into hospital and eventually recovered			0
where he was put on a drip while doctors monitored his liver and white blood cell count			0
" as far as i understand it i was lucky ... there are other symptoms that i 've heard are pretty gruesome , " he said			0
worldwide problem while dengue fever is not transmitted human to human , the @entity1 health ministry said that domestic mosquitoes could have picked it up from people infected abroad			1
almost half the world 's population lives in high - risk countries , the @entity2 says			1
last year , @entity101 suffered a sweeping epidemic , which saw four die of the disease and over 12,000 become infected			0
@entity104 , an assistant professor at @entity106 's @entity105 , said that the @entity19 outbreak was most likely imported into the country by an infected individual , who then transmitted it to domestic mosquitoes			2
" probably one person who was infected outside @entity1 went to ( @entity114 ) park , " he said			2
" it 's possible that there was an infected mosquito ( transported to @entity1 ) in a bag , but the patient numbers indicate that it was likely an infected person			2
" he says that it is likely that there have been previous , small and undiagnosed outbreaks in @entity1 before , but this one was flagged by a doctor who had experience spotting the symptoms of the virus			2
to date there have been no fatalities in the @entity1 outbreak , and @entity104 is confident that the virus can be contained			1
" it will ( most likely ) be controlled			0
it will be autumn soon and this type of mosquito ca n't survive the cold weather			0
" climate - linked spread the disease is on the rise , and over half of the world 's population live in dengue endemic areas			1
the @entity1 outbreak comes as a @entity2 conference examining the links between health and climate change warned of the risks of infectious diseases like malaria and dengue which are strongly influenced by climate			1
higher humidity and temperatures mean mosquitoes can survive longer , increasing the likelihood for transmitting diseases and being able to travel to a wider geographic range			0
" vulnerable populations , the poor , the disadvantaged and children are among those suffering the greatest burden of climate - related impacts and consequent diseases , such as malaria , diarrhea and malnutrition , which already kill millions every year , " said dr. @entity161 , @entity2 assistant director - general , @entity163 , women 's and @entity175 in a press release			1
" without effective action to mitigate and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change on health , society will face one of its most serious health challenges			1
" @entity104 agrees that climate change is a factor , giving rise to longer periods that infected mosquitoes can survive			1
adverse conditions , such as drought , however , can also impede the spread of the disease			0
drought in parts of @entity195 this summer has denied the mosquitoes the water that their larvae need to develop , leading to " extremely low " numbers of dengue cases this year , the @entity193 reported			2
urban centers affected worst @entity104 says , the primary cause of the spread of dengue fever is linked to population movement and the rapid urbanization of developing countries , the majority of which are in the tropical zone most often affected by dengue fever there is no cure for , and no vaccination against , dengue fever , the disease can develop into a " potentially lethal complication " called severe dengue , also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever			1
the @entity2 estimates that there are over 50 - 100 million cases of dengue worldwide each year , although a new study says the true number may be four times as high as that appraisal			1
study suggests new approach to dengue fever 5 myths about mosquito bites			1

@entity1 facing first outbreak of dengue fever in almost 70 years
@entity2 says climate change could lead to an increase in the prevalence of the disease
carried by mosquitoes , dengue is a debilitating illness and can be fatal
