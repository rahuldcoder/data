@entity0 , @entity1 -- on june 21 , 1930 , a @entity3 boarded the @entity4 at @entity5 , carrying in his baggage a small winged statuette representing @entity8 , the @entity10 goddess of victory			0
also aboard the @entity13 - bound liner were footballers from @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			0
the @entity3 was @entity18 and the golden trophy was the @entity20			1
@entity18 's vision , conceived in the aftermath of @entity23 , was of a global tournament which reflected football 's growing international popularity			0
but as the vessel set sail for @entity31 , the competition 's prospects did not look particularly good			0
@entity32 had been awarded the event following gold medals at the 1924 and @entity35 , and because the competition coincided with the @entity13 country 's centenary celebrations			1
but , with the world 's economy reeling from the @entity42 , just 12 other teams took part			1
@entity1 , claiming de facto supremacy in a sport they had invented and exported , were among those to snub the tournament			0
unsurprisingly , the first final would prove a local affair , with the hosts beating neighboring @entity52 4 - 2			0
two more @entity53 would be played before @entity54 -- both won by @entity56 -- but the competition remained an event finding its feet as sporting issues were overshadowed by the darkening mood in @entity62			1
@entity18 's trophy spent the war hidden in a shoe box under the bed of an @entity68 football official			0
a new era began in 1950 as hosts @entity71 built the world 's biggest football stadium , @entity75 's @entity74 , to showcase a competition which they were also expected to dominate			1
@entity1 , finally sending a team , suffered an ignominious 1 - 0 defeat against the @entity80 but it was the final match that delivered the greatest shock as @entity32 , in front of an expectant crowd of almost 200,000 , stunned the hosts 2 - 1			1
in @entity71 the match became known as the " fateful final			1
" yet it was also the trauma of the defeat which would fuel @entity71 's obsession with winning the tournament , paving the way for the country 's later dominance			1
2010 @entity20 : a catalyst for a new @entity97 ? the @entity20 returned to @entity62 in 1954 with @entity99 playing hosts and @entity100 , led by " galloping major " @entity102 , arriving as favorites			1
the @entity104 thrashed in 17 goals in their opening two games , including an 8 - 3 win over @entity109 , their eventual opponents in the final			0
but in a match known in @entity109 as the " @entity114 , " it was @entity116 's side who emerged as 3 - 2 winners			0
the 1958 @entity20 in @entity119 marked the arrival of a 17 - year - old superstar called @entity122 , better known as @entity122 , as @entity71 were crowned champions at last			1
@entity122 did n't appear until the quarterfinals , but followed the winning goal against @entity126 with a hat - trick against @entity15 and two more in a 5 - 2 win over the hosts in the final			0
@entity71 were winners again in 1962 in @entity132 , this time inspired by @entity134 's trickery			2
the winger scored four times in wins over @entity1 and @entity132 before @entity71 completed the defense of their crown with a 3 - 1 win over @entity142			2
1966 was the year when @entity1 finally embraced the @entity20 , with home advantage proving enough to carry @entity145 's side all the way to the title , capped by @entity149 's hat - trick in a 4 - 2 final win over @entity109			2
but the victory also marked the beginning of the country 's still unfulfilled obsession with repeating the feat. the 1970 @entity20 in @entity156 was a technicolored spectacle , brought live to millions of television screens by satellite technology and featuring a virtuoso performance by a @entity162 team considered the greatest in football history			1
@entity122 produced the tournament 's most memorable cameos , including his famous near - miss from the halfway line against @entity142 and an astonishing dummy that sent the ball past a bewildered @entity32 keeper -- though neither moment led to a goal			1
the save from his downward header by @entity1 goalkeeper @entity174 is rated by many as the best of all time			0
@entity178 achieved the unique feat of scoring in every match while captain @entity182 capped his side 's 4 - 1 win over @entity56 in the final with an emphatic finish that summed up the @entity162 ' supremacy			2
by 1974 , the @entity20 was starting to resemble its modern incarnation , with teams such as @entity190 -- the first from @entity192 -- and @entity193 extending the competition 's reach beyond its roots in @entity62 and @entity13			1
@entity199 's brilliant @entity198 side took the tournament by storm with their revolutionary " total football " but it was hosts @entity109 who came out on top 2 - 1 in the final			0
who will be the @entity20 's best player ? home advantage also proved decisive in 1978 as @entity52 ended their long wait for @entity20 success with @entity212 scoring twice in a 3 - 1 win over the @entity214 in the final			2
for some however , the tournament was tainted , offering apparent legitimacy to the country 's oppressive military regime			0
@entity56 ended their long wait for a third title in 1982 in @entity223 , recovering from a slow start to beat favorites @entity71 in a thrilling second - round match in which striker @entity227 scored a hat - trick on his way to winning the top scorer 's @entity230			1
@entity109 were the @entity68 ' opponents in the final , though their passage was marred by a semifinal penalties victory over @entity15 principally remembered for a horrendous challenge by @entity109 goalkeeper @entity237 which left @entity3 @entity239 unconscious			0
@entity227 opened the scoring in @entity56 's 3 - 1 win			2
the 1986 tournament in @entity156 belonged to @entity243 , whose individual brilliance carried @entity52 to victory virtually single - handedly -- literally in the case of his notorious " @entity248 " goal against @entity1			1
@entity243 's second goal of that match , a waltzing solo from inside his own half , confirmed him as football 's greatest talent since @entity122 , and not even a @entity109 fightback from two goals down in the final could prevent @entity52 being crowned champions as 3 - 2 winners			0
the 1990 tournament in @entity56 opened with a stunning upset as @entity262 beat @entity52 1 - 0 in a brutal performance which saw them end the game with nine men			1
@entity52 regrouped to advance to the final , setting up a rematch of the 1986 final against @entity109			0
this time the @entity270 , the tournament 's most impressive side , came out on top , winning 1 - 0			0
@entity243 's last @entity20 , in the @entity80 in 1994 , ended in disgrace as he failed a drugs test			2
@entity276 went into the competition as favorites but their participation ended tragically with early elimination and the murder on their return home of defender @entity284 , the scorer of a critical own - goal			0
that left @entity71 , led by @entity287 , carrying the @entity13 challenge , while @entity68 @entity289 hauled his team through the knockout stages in a trio of match - winning performances against @entity295 , @entity223 and @entity296			2
but @entity289 's fate was to be remembered as the man who missed in the first final to be settled on penalties , shooting over the crossbar to send the @entity20 back to @entity71 for the first time since 1970			1
@entity20 predictions @entity71 reached the final once again in 1998 , but the buildup to their clash with hosts @entity15 would prove more dramatic than the match itself as the world 's most feared striker , @entity311 , was first omitted from the @entity162 ' team sheet and then reinstated at the last minute			1
later reports suggested @entity311 had suffered a pre-match fit , and the incident seemed to be playing on his teammates ' minds as @entity319 struck twice for @entity15 in a 3 - 0 win , triggering wild celebrations on the @entity322			0
in 2002 the @entity20 visited @entity323 for the first time , co-hosted by @entity325 and @entity326			2
it was a tournament of upsets with @entity328 humbling @entity15 in the opening game and @entity326 riding their luck and some generous refereeing to oust @entity223 and @entity56 on their way to the last four			1
@entity335 were also surprise semifinalists , but the final brought together two heavyweights in @entity71 and @entity109			2
making up for the disappointment of 1998 , @entity311 scored both goals in a 2 - 0 win as @entity71 became five - time winners			2
both @entity319 and @entity343 found the net in the 2006 final in @entity109 between @entity15 and @entity56 , but it was the pair 's off - the - ball clash deep into extra time that became the tournament 's defining moment			1
@entity319 had emerged from international retirement to lead his country to the final , a fitting stage for the greatest player of his generation 's final game			0
instead , @entity319 was dismissed from the field for headbutting @entity343 , apparently in retaliation to some verbal insult offered by the @entity68 defender			0
@entity15 's 10 men held out for a 1 - 1 draw but without their talisman the fates had swung decisively against them			0
having defied the distraction of a match - fixing scandal at home and beaten hosts @entity109 in a tense semifinal , the @entity68 held their nerve once again to convert five perfect penalties and win the @entity20 for the fourth time .			1

only 12 teams traveled to @entity32 for the first @entity20 ever held in 1930
twenty years later , the tournament entered a new era when it was staged in @entity71
the 1970 event in @entity156 featured technicolor coverage via satellite television broadcasts
@entity56 go into the the 2010 tournament in @entity97 as the defending champions
