thanks to a @entity4 physicist , the notion of warp speed might just travel out of sci - fi and into the real world			1
@entity4 's @entity7 has been working since 2010 to develop a warp drive that will allow spacecraft to travel at speeds faster than light -- 186,000 miles per second			1
@entity7 , who heads @entity4 's @entity12 , spoke about his conceptual starship at a conference last fall			1
but interest in his project reached a new level this week when he unveiled images of what the craft might look like			1
created by artist @entity22 , who based them on @entity7 's designs , the images show a technologically detailed spacecraft that would n't look out of place in a " @entity28 " movie			1
@entity22 says creating them took more than 1,600 hours			2
for now , warp speed is only possible in tv and movies , with both " @entity28 " and " @entity32 " referencing an idea that was completely speculative at the time			0
@entity7 has fittingly named the concept spacecraft @entity36 , for the starship famously piloted by captain @entity38 in the " @entity28 " tv series and movies			1
at the @entity41 last november in @entity42 , @entity7 talked about his design , the concepts behind it and the progress that 's been made in warp - drive development over the decades			1
he discussed the idea of a " space warp , " a loophole in the theory of general relativity that would allow for massive distances to be traveled very quickly , reducing travel times from thousands of years to days			2
in his speech , @entity7 described space warps as faraway galaxies that can bend light around them			2
they work on the principle of bending space both in front of and behind a spacecraft			0
this would essentially allow for the empty space behind the craft to expand , both pushing and pulling it forward at the same time			0
the concept is similar to that of an escalator or moving walkway			0
" there 's no speed limit on the expansion and contraction of space , " @entity7 said at the conference			2
" you can actually find a way to get around what i like to call the 11th commandment : thou shall not exceed the speed of light			0
" it 's the idea of space warps that inspired physicist @entity86 in 1994 to first theorize a mathematical model of a warp drive that would be able to bend space and time			1
while studying @entity86 's equations , @entity7 decided to design his own retooled version of the @entity92			2
his recently unveiled design has much less empty space than the first concept model , increasing its efficiency			0
the warp drive that @entity7 's team has been working on would literally transcend space , shortening the distance between two points and allowing the craft to break the speed of light			1
this would be a spaceship with no speed limit			0
because travel into space has been extremely limited due to existing means of propulsion , such a technology could blow open the possibilities of space exploration			0
it could allow for study of the farthest reaches of space , parts that scientists once considered unimaginable			0
although the technology to create the spacecraft or the warp drive does n't yet exist , the artistic renderings @entity22 created could potentially be a model of what 's to come -- the first spacecraft to break the speed - of - light barrier and journey beyond our solar system			1
in his design , @entity7 says he drew from @entity133 ' 1965 sketches of the @entity134 from " @entity28 , " saying parts of that ship were mathematically correct			0
he worked with @entity22 and graphic designer @entity137 to update the math and produce what he believes to be a viable spacecraft			2
according to @entity4 , there has n't been any proof that a warp drive can exist , but the agency is experimenting nonetheless			1
although the concept does n't violate the laws of physics , that does n't guarantee that it will work			0
" we 're starting to talk about what the next chapter for human space exploration going to be , " @entity7 said at @entity41 .			0

renderings are by artist @entity22 , who based them on @entity7 's designs
warp drive would let spacecraft travel at speeds faster than light
