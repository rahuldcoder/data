-- with a few quick strokes of a pen this week , @entity2 president @entity1 signed into law a widely debated measure that aims to end hundreds of years of racial disparity			1
whether the @entity8 will succeed in a nation where about the half the population consists of people of color , but most of the political and economic power resides in white hands , will not be known for years			1
some observers say the law will just make matters worse because the inequalities in the nation of more than 201 million people are economic and social , not racial			1
" it makes @entity2 do what @entity2 has never done , which is racialize the debate , " said @entity23 , director of the @entity24 at the @entity25			1
" the way to face it is not to define who is this or who is that , but to create opportunities			0
" about 54 percent of @entity2 are white , 39 percent are mixed race and 6 percent are black , according to the @entity35			1
but those distinctions are lost on most @entity2 , @entity23 and others say			1
" i have black ancestors , indigenous ancestors , @entity41 ancestors , and i personally do n't give a damn , " @entity23 said			2
that 's not to say that huge inequalities do n't exist			1
the country 's @entity45 -- the value of goods and services it produces -- was $ 2 trillion in 2009 , the 10th largest in the world , according to the @entity35			1
but per capita income for the same year was estimated at $ 10,200 , the 105th highest in the world			2
simply stated , most of the wealth being produced is not finding its way down to most @entity2			1
it 's people of color who bear the brunt of that inequality			1
@entity2 of @entity62 descent earn 58 cents for every $ 1 a white @entity2 makes , according to the government 's @entity64			1
this in a country where one of every four @entity2 lives below the poverty level			1
" the poor generally have darker skin , " @entity23 said			0
but that 's not because blacks are considered inherently inferior , but because they have n't had the opportunities , analysts say			1
" the country really favors a meritocracy , " said @entity76 , director of the @entity77 , a liberal @entity79 think tank			0
" if you had the talent and you had the education , you could succeed , " @entity76 said			0
" it just so happened that most of the time the whites had the education			2
" @entity88 , president emeritus of the @entity90 policy institute , notes that " if people move up the social ladder , they 're not viewed by a racial prism			1
" much discrimination has been based on economic class , not race			2
" it 's a class and social issue that sometimes expresses itself as racial , " @entity23 said			1
" i 'm not saying there is no racism			0
yes , there is , " he said			0
" but in @entity2 there is no racial hatred			1
" @entity76 recalls that rich people would place ads in newspapers years ago seeking husbands for their daughters			2
the ads would note that " race need not matter , " he said			0
" the rich were n't particularly scornful of the blacks , " @entity76 said			0
" they simply were scornful of those who were poor			0
" still , though , people of color have faced barriers -- physical and otherwise			1
" not long ago , " @entity88 said , " black people were required to use the service entrance to buildings			0
now , that 's not so			0
" the @entity2 @entity123 approved the @entity124 in june and @entity1 signed it tuesday			1
senators removed provisions for racial quotas in universities and businesses , but the law offers tax incentives for enterprises that undertake racial inclusion , the @entity126 newspaper reported wednesday			0
the law also defines what constitutes racial discrimination and inequality and says that anyone who considers himself or herself a black or mulatto is covered			0
in addition , the law stipulates that @entity62 and @entity2 black history be taught in all elementary and middle schools			1
@entity2 will hold elections for a new president in october and some observers see adoption of the racial equality law as one of the last pieces of unfinished business before @entity1 leaves office			1
" the law is one of a number of things that @entity1 has done to face up to various @entity2 dilemmas , " @entity76 said			2
" he has placed issues on the agenda that previously had difficulty being there			0
" enactment of the measure shows how far the country has come , @entity88 said			0
" until 10 or 12 years ago , " he said , " @entity2 was very sensitive about race			2
now @entity2 has begun to feel a little more relaxed about the whole thing			2
" and the law is significant , @entity88 said , because @entity2 now is " willing to admit racial discrimination			1
" observers emphasize it would be a mistake to compare the racial situation in @entity2 with the @entity173			1
for starters , the definition of who is black is significantly different			0
" in the @entity173 , a person who has one drop of black blood is considered black , " @entity23 said , pointing out that president @entity177 is labeled as black although his mother was white			0
" in @entity2 , it 's just the opposite , " he said			1
" a person who has one drop of white blood is considered not black			0
" @entity2 's initial pool of @entity62 natives also was much larger than in the @entity173			1
about 900,000 slaves survived the trip from @entity62 to the @entity173 , @entity23 said , while 3.7 million slaves made it to @entity2			1
the sheer weight of that many slaves made them a larger part of @entity2 society , he said			2
slavery became illegal in the @entity173 in 1865 when @entity198 passed the 13th amendment to the @entity200 , while @entity2 outlawed slavery in 1888			2
@entity23 sees a major difference in the aftermath in the two countries , though , because much of the racism in the @entity173 was codified into laws that were not overturned until the federal @entity207 and the @entity208 , 100 years after the end of the @entity210			0
" there were no @entity213 laws in @entity2 , officially , " @entity23 said			2
" there was prejudice , but it was not categorized in law			0
" says @entity88 , " @entity2 has a longer history of the two races living side by side			2
" compared with the @entity173 , he said , " the difference between blacks and whites in @entity2 was never that dramatic			1
" as a result , he said , there 's a big difference in how @entity62 descendants see themselves in each country			1
" blacks in the @entity173 recognize themselves mostly as being black first , " he said			0
" in @entity2 , they see themselves as being black and @entity2			2
" in the @entity173 , race tends to be all - determining			0
it 's not the same in @entity2			1
there 's lots of discrimination , but not this all - too - determining factor			0
" but @entity2 's new law could increase racial tensions , @entity23 said , because people could start thinking more in those terms			1
" it 's a very controversial measure because it mandates that people identify themselves as black or white , " he said			2
" most brazilians would have difficulties to put themselves in a category			0
" or the law could turn out to be meaningless			0
" one of the things that could happen with it is nothing , " he said			0
" there are many laws in @entity2 that are not fully implemented because there are no resources			2
" regardless , @entity88 said , passage of the law carries weight			0
" laws always have two sides , " he said			0
" there 's the symbolic side			0
" now we have to implement the law and see what happens			0

@entity2 's *problems* are social and economic , not racial , some analysts say
many @entity2 do n't think in racial terms , the analysts say
nearly half of all @entity2 are people of color
the income gap between whites and people of @entity62 descent is nearly 2 to 1
