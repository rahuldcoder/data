-- you likely know that being overweight increases your risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes			0
but did you know it also increases your risk for cancer ? if you did n't , you 're not alone			1
while around 90 % of @entity10 know that smoking is linked to higher rates of cancer , dr. @entity9 says , the inverse is true for obesity and cancer ; less than 10 % of us realize how fat is related to this chronic disease			1
" obesity is a major , under - recognized contributor to the nation 's cancer toll and is quickly overtaking tobacco as the leading preventable cause of cancer , " @entity9 and his colleagues at the @entity18 write in a new position paper			1
in fact , as many as 84,000 cancer diagnoses each year are linked to obesity , according to the @entity27			1
excess fat also affects how cancer treatments work and may increase a cancer patient 's risk of death , either from cancer or from other related causes			1
the key word , @entity9 says , is preventable			2
while we ca n't change the fact that we 're all getting older ( incidence rates for most cancers increase as patients age ) , we can change our weight through diet , exercise , sleep and stress management			1
the link in 2003 , the @entity47 published the results of a study that included more than 900,000 @entity10 adults			0
researchers followed the healthy study participants for 16 years , and found the heaviest participants were more likely to develop and die from cancer than participants who were at a healthy weight			1
after their analysis , the study authors concluded that excess fat " could account for 14 % of all deaths from cancer in men and 20 % of those in women			2
" since then , research has simply strengthened the link between obesity and cancer			1
studies have found a relationship between weight and the risk of as many as 12 cancers , says dr. @entity71 , chief medical officer for the @entity72 , including endometrial , colorectal , esophageal , kidney and pancreatic cancers			2
a recent report published in the @entity80 's journal predicted the top cancer killers in the @entity10 by 2030 will be lung , pancreas and liver -- in part because of rising obesity rates			1
the science behind it " it 's not enough to say there 's an association between obesity and cancer			1
we need to know why , " @entity9 says			0
" with the why , we can do something about it			0
" scientists are exploring several hypotheses on how excess fat increases a person 's risk for cancer			2
the answer may be slightly different for each type of cancer , but the encompassing explanation seems to be that obesity triggers changes in how the body operates , which can cause harmful cell growth and cell division			1
many of these changes may be linked to inflammation			2
in general , inflammation occurs when your body is reacting to something out of the norm -- say a virus or a splinter in your foot			0
obesity seems to cause chronic inflammation , which in turn may promote cancer development			1
take for example , @entity9 says , hormone - sensitive breast cancers			0
chemicals in the body meant to regulate inflammation also increase production of the hormone estrogen			0
and studies have shown excess estrogen can cause breast cancer tumors			2
fat tissue also produces hormones called adipokines , which can stimulate or inhibit cell growth , according to a fact sheet from the oncology society			0
if these hormones are out of balance , the body may not be able to properly fight cell damage			0
let 's talk about sex ... and cancer treatment and mortality obesity can affect a cancer patient 's outcome from diagnosis to remission , @entity9 says			1
obesity - related pain or unbalanced hormone levels may distract patients from the early warning signs of some cancers			2
fatty tissue can also make it difficult for doctors to see tumors on imaging scans			0
and a late diagnosis often means a lower chance for survival			0
the relationship between cancer and obesity also matters after diagnosis			1
cancer treatments , such as radiation or chemotherapy , may be hindered by a patient 's size			2
if the patient needs surgery , studies show excess fat puts them at a higher risk of complications , infections and death			0
tumor paint : changing the way surgeons fight cancer a recent study of 80,000 breast cancer patients found that pre-menopausal women with a @entity190 over 30 had a 21.5 % chance of dying , compared to women with an average @entity190 who had a 16.6 % chance of death			2
remaining obese as a survivor can also increase your risk of developing what 's called a secondary cancer , the authors of this new position paper say			0
what you can do to reduce your risk in general , " people should be aware that overweight and obesity , as common as they are in our population , have serious consequences , " @entity9 says			0
" @entity210 is really just another one			0
" start reducing your risk now : stay active			0
eat nutritious foods that are low in calories			0
get seven to eight hours of sleep a night			0
all these behaviors will help you reach a healthy weight			0
11 simple weight loss tips if you or someone you know is a cancer survivor , talk to your oncologist			1
he or she should be aware of the link between cancer and obesity , @entity9 says , and able to help you find resources in your community			1
the @entity18 is recommending more research be done on weight loss in the cancer survivor population to determine the best intervention method -- and whether losing weight after a diagnosis improves patient outcomes			1
the results of these future studies could help persuade insurance providers to reimburse patients for weight management programs .			1

@entity18 : @entity242 may overtake tobacco as leading preventable cause of cancer
84,000 cancer diagnoses each year can be linked to obesity
we can change our weight through diet , exercise , sleep , stress management
