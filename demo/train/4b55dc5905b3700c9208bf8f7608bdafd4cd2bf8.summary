-- for decades , comic books have had major shake - ups in their pages , with varying degrees of fan support -- and outrage			1
in 1992 , well before the advent of social media , @entity6 was killed and comic books went flying off the shelves			1
in 2007 , social media like @entity12 and @entity13 were in their infancy when @entity15 died			2
and now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in @entity21 's alter ego , @entity21 -- a firestorm has erupted , after @entity16 revealed that @entity21 will die , and the role of @entity21 will be taken over by his archenemy , @entity24			1
the just - released " @entity28 " # 700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years			1
all parties involved maintain that the changes are quite permanent , and next month the saga begins anew with the release of " @entity33 " # 1 , with the @entity34 , @entity24 , stepping into the @entity21 suit			1
@entity24 believes that with the combination of his intelligence and @entity21 's inherited memories and spider powers , he can be an uber - @entity21			1
he can live @entity21 's life better than @entity21 could -- from fighting crime to getting back together with on - again , off - again girlfriend @entity42			1
when issue # 700 was leaked early , fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive , with a few death threats directed at the issue 's writer , @entity47			1
@entity47 reacted on his @entity13 and @entity12 by saying he would report any threats : " reality check : there is no such thing as a ' funny death threat			0
' especially if you tag someone in it			0
" @entity47 later noted that the reactions were getting more civil , as time went on			2
comic book reader calls the new @entity21 ' inferior ' @entity0 spoke separately to @entity47 and to @entity16 editor @entity60 about the controversial comic			1
@entity0 : why did you choose @entity24 as the next @entity21 ? @entity47 : when we first met @entity21 , he was a teenage bespectacled nerd who resented all the other kids			1
one of his first lines was , " some day i 'll show them all ! some day they 'll be sorry they ever laughed at me			0
" that 's not something a hero would say			0
if @entity21 had never learned the lesson of " great power and great responsibility , " there 's every chance he would have become a supervillain			1
and then you have @entity24 , a bespectacled scientist who , after his radioactive accident , became the eight - legged @entity24			2
for all intents and purposes , he was the adult @entity21 could have become , @entity21 's dark reflection			1
so what if we flipped it ? what if we gave him a second chance ? @entity21 's final , heroic act was giving @entity34 all the memories and experiences that kept him on the right path			1
but is that enough ? can that overcome @entity24 's true nature ? @entity0 : how did this idea originate ? @entity60 : this was an idea @entity100 had when he came onto the book			2
it changed shape as we went			0
it was n't originally going to be in the 700th issue , but as the story grew , we realized maybe it was time to change up the makeup of @entity21 for good , to make a permanent change			1
with that and the fact that the 50th anniversary was approaching , we thought , let 's go out with a bang			0
@entity0 : did the word spread around @entity16 quickly when this was first discussed ? @entity60 : three times a year we have editorial retreats , where we bring in our writers and discuss every single book			2
anytime we talk about @entity21 , it 's a big deal			1
there were certainly some loud opinions in the room			0
our editor - in - chief , @entity126 , was one of the louder voices not buying it originally			2
all the things @entity130 poked at toughened the story up and made us look at things differently			0
@entity0 : was that a sneak preview of how fans might react ? @entity60 : the fan reaction never really surprises me			2
anything you do with any of our characters , there 's a big vocal fan base , particularly online			2
it gets more magnified with @entity21			1
you find people of all stripes reacting -- people who have been reading it for 50 years and love it , and others who say they 're quitting @entity16 forever			0
i keep all the fan mail			0
you can see some of the same people who have written about six things over the past six years that made them drop @entity16 forever			0
there are not a lot of storytelling opportunities in the world where you get such an immediate , visceral reaction			0
that 's a part of the job i like			0
@entity47 : i 've actually gotten a fair amount of " this is awesome ! " ( reactions to the story ) , but it 's been very polarizing			2
no one has a middling review			0
no one has a take of , " it was all right			0
" people are very split			0
i got an angry tweet saying , " i do n't like seeing bad things happen to good people			0
" i 'm like , good luck reading @entity176 , @entity177 -- anything in literature ! now people are saying , " nooooo ! why are you being mean to ( @entity21 ) ? " the answer is two words : " @entity184			1
" @entity0 : have you learned anything in dealing with the reaction to this particular issue on social media ? @entity47 : we have the most passionate fans in the world ! everyone knows who @entity21 is -- and everyone cares about him ! in the world of comics , thanks to ( newspaper publisher ) @entity200 , everyone thinks he 's a menace			1
but in our world , he 's beloved			0
now we 're going to flip that too			0
they are n't ready to cut this guy a break			0
they think he 's a menace ! this is going to be the most meta @entity21 of them all ! and going from everything i 've seen on social media , i am so up for that challenge !			1
