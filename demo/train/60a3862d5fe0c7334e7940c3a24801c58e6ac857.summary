-- did you have a nasty case of food poisoning this year ? chances are that fruit or vegetables were the culprit			0
every year , one in six @entity8 gets sick from food , 128,000 people are ill enough to go to the hospital for their symptoms , which typically include nausea , vomiting and diarrhea			0
major food recalls and reports of food - related illness seem to be a monthly , if not weekly occurrence , with a bout of illness from contaminated ground beef reported just this week			2
over the last three days , @entity23 recalled batches of its @entity25 , and @entity26 of @entity27 , @entity28 , recalled 1953 pounds of alfalfa , clover , brocco sandwich sprouts , and spicy sprouts due to potential contamination with @entity34			0
taking a closer look at the problem , the @entity8 @entity35 released a comprehensive report detailing the common sources of foodborne illness in the @entity8 from the years 1998 through 2008			1
the largest culprit ? leafy greens			0
based on data from nearly 4,600 outbreaks of food illness , researchers estimated the number of cases attributable to 17 different food categories and found that produce accounted for 46 % of cases			1
leafy vegetables such as spinach and cabbage were responsible for the majority of the illnesses , and most were caused by norovirus , which is spread to produce from water contaminated by fecal matter			1
@entity0 : @entity61 proposes major regulations for food safety although contaminated meat and poultry triggered fewer illnesses , they accounted for the most deaths -- at 19 % -- from listeria and salmonella infections			1
in the last ten years , there have been three major listeria outbreaks linked to sliced processed turkey , and salmonella was responsible for the most recent sickness among several people who consumed kibbeh , a @entity79 dish with raw meat , from a restaurant in @entity82			2
despite the findings , the @entity35 says that people should n't avoid eating fruit and veggies			1
" when properly cleaned , separated , cooked , and stored to limit contamination , fruits and vegetables safely provide some essential nutrients that would otherwise be lacking in most @entity8 diets , " the report authors write			0
the goal of the report , in fact , is n't to scare consumers but to aid regulatory agencies in their efforts to prevent contamination and improve food safety			0
although the report does n't pinpoint where along the production chain food gets contaminated , the @entity35 says its previous research found most infections are caused by norovirus that is spread by sick food handlers			1
in a report on foodborne norovirus outbreaks during 2001 to 2008 , the @entity35 found over 80 % of outbreaks were associated with food prepared in commercial settings like restaurants , delis , or catering businesses			1
@entity0 : illnesses from imported foods on the rise health officials hope the timing of the report brings more attention to needed changes in how food is handled and processed in the @entity8			2
the @entity35 's report follows the @entity61 's recently released food safety rule proposals earlier this month			1
the @entity61 released two major requirements for improving food safety for public commentary , and will be holding a public meeting on the rules at the end of february			0
the draft proposals -- the first in 70 years -- will allow the @entity61 to take on a preventative rather than reactive role in dealing with food contamination			0
one of the rules focuses specifically on produce , which the @entity35 found is the main cause of foodborne illness in the @entity8			1
the @entity61 proposal will require strict standards for growing , harvesting , packing and holding fruits and vegetables as well as increase sanitation for irrigating fields and washing produce and strengthen rules for maintaining worker hygiene			2
it will also increase surveillance for materials used in soils like fertilizers and manure , provide better management of animals that enter crop fields , and improve cleanliness of processing equipment			0
@entity0 : illnesses from salmonella , e. coli rose in 2010 health officials hope the reports lead to substantial changes in food handling that will translate into fewer outbreaks of foodborne illnesses , which they , say , are largely preventable			2
this story was originally published on @entity0 veggies to blame for majority of foodborne illnesses			0

@entity35 researchers find produce accounts for 46 % of illnesses
most were caused by norovirus , which is spread via contaminated water
