@entity1 @entity0 might not be a member of the @entity4 , but the independent senator from @entity6 is openly considering a run at the party 's presidential nomination -- and that might not be a problem after all			1
according to a @entity13 aide , @entity0 would not have a problem getting on @entity4 primary and caucus ballots because the current party rules do not call for presidential candidates to be registered members of the party			1
the @entity13 defines a presidential candidate as someone who " has accrued delegates in the nominating process and plans to seek the nomination , has established substantial support for his or her nomination as the @entity4 candidate for the @entity31 , is a bona fide @entity32 whose record of public service , accomplishment , public writings and / or public statements affirmatively demonstrates that he or she is faithful to the interests , welfare and success of the @entity4 , and will participate in the @entity42 in good faith			1
" @entity0 , according to the @entity13 aide who asked to be anonymous because he is not yet a candidate , appears to comply with those rules			1
" there is no registration requirement , " said the aide			0
" you have to be a good faith @entity4 , but you do n't have to submit some sort of proof of registration			2
there is no long form birth certificate required showing you were born a @entity32			2
" states do have the ability to write their own rules for who qualifies as a candidate in their respective primary or caucus , but the aide said no one at the @entity13 can recall a state that has ever included being a registered @entity32 as a requirement for their presidential candidates			1
that is the case for @entity73 in 2016 , too			0
" the @entity75 has always welcomed potential candidates for our party 's presidential nomination with open arms , " said @entity74 , spokeswoman for the @entity75			2
" in terms of who is eligible to participate as a candidate , we take our cues from the @entity13 's rules			2
" @entity86 , a @entity4 political consultant working with senator , points out that because @entity0 has come up politically in @entity6 -- a state with no party registration -- there is actually no way for him to register officially as a @entity32			1
" the mechanism does n't exist , " said @entity86			0
the political consultant , however , said that in order to get on the ballot in some states , @entity0 would have to " pledge some allegiance to the @entity4			1
" " he wo n't have to sign on to every plank of the @entity4 platform in order to get in , but he will have to acknowledge that he is running as a @entity32 , " @entity86 said			1
" i think @entity0 will have to do that			0
" @entity0 has caucused with the @entity4 ever since he came to @entity1 as a congressman in 1991			1
he unsuccessfully ran for the @entity103 in 1971 as a member of @entity105 and , in 1981 , when he successfully ran for mayor of @entity107 , @entity6 , he did so as an independent			0
at times , the senator identifies as a democratic ( small @entity109 ) socialist			0
but now that he is considering a run for the @entity4 nomination , his calculation is changing			0
" i am getting balder and balder trying to figure these things out , " he said at an event in @entity1 on monday where he acknowledged -- as he has before -- that he would not run outside the @entity4 establishment			0
whether he would change his party affiliation is another story			0
" that is a decision i would have to make , " he has said			0
@entity86 , the political consultant working with @entity0 , put it bluntly : " would something stop @entity0 from running as a @entity32 ? the bottom line answer to that is no. "			2

a @entity13 aide says the fact @entity0 is n't a registered @entity32 might not be a presidential problem for him
the party defines " bona fide @entity4 " as someone " whose record of public service , accomplishment , public writings " comport with the party
@entity0 has been an independent since the 1980s , but has caucused with the @entity4 since coming to @entity138 in 1991
