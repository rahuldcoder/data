@entity0 -- for months , the @entity2 has struggled to take a strong stand against @entity4 for its incursion into @entity6			1
and while @entity10 's leaders are acutely aware of the threat to peace on their eastern flank , the countries with the most at stake have , time after time , seemed unable to present a united and resolute front			1
but the downing of @entity16 has become a game changer -- a watershed moment which most concede would be too dangerous to let go			0
and now , as @entity10 prepares to finally take decisive steps , its chiefs will have to recognize that , if they are to be effective , they will also have to hurt their economies			1
as a block , the @entity25 exports about 100 billion euros worth of goods and services to @entity4 and takes in roughly 200 billion euros of the latter 's imports			1
that is money that matters , for sure , but it 's not @entity4 's role as a consumer that would affect @entity10 most			1
rather , it 's @entity4 's function as a major supplier of energy			2
should @entity4 cut its gas to the @entity2 in response , the loss in @entity10 production would more damaging than the hit its trade balance would take			1
just as the region is trying its best to revive a stagnant economy , attempting to mend a fragile debt market and tackle high unemployment , alienating a major trading partner next door is a risk @entity10 's ministers are understandably loath to take			2
and some countries have more to lose than others			0
with its billion dollar contracts for @entity57 warships -- a deal which keeps some 1,000 @entity59 and women employed in a country with a 10 % unemployment rate -- @entity59 is @entity10 's largest supplier of arms to @entity4			1
the @entity65 also provides more minor military hardware and sells cars to @entity4			2
with its own gas fields in the @entity69 and the potential in future years to harness its shale oil , the @entity65 does have other energy options			0
however if the @entity25 hits @entity4 state - owned banks , @entity0 's financial center would suffer while its luxurious residences in the capital would also become less appealing to the swathe of oligarchs who have relocated to @entity65 of late			2
for @entity80 , curtailed trade with @entity4 could really bite			2
and considering as the former is @entity10 's biggest economy the implications would be felt well beyond its borders			2
more than 6,000 @entity80 firms operate in @entity4 , pouring in billions of dollars in foreign direct investment			0
some 300,000 @entity80 workers depend on their country 's trade with @entity4 for their livelihoods			0
sectors like the automotive industry , defense and engineering which have haemorrhaged jobs since the 2008 crisis would be hit hard once again			0
so , are such sanctions really worth it and would they work ? to answer this question it depends on what @entity10 hopes to achieve			1
@entity4 's economy was already headed for a recession before @entity10 and the @entity104 started talking tough			1
some $ 90 billion of capital is likely to flee its markets this year , according to the conservative estimates of @entity4 's central bank which was forced to pull a recent bond auction due to unfavorable market conditions			0
by tightening the noose over @entity4 's banks , @entity10 hopes not only to turn the country 's key industrialists away from president @entity115 but also to limit the @entity117 's ability to fund its banks on the international markets , meaning @entity4 would have to dig deep into its currency reserves and undermine the value of the @entity122 -- a currency which has up until now been surprisingly unruffled			1
in the longer term -- say in three to five years -- bans on equipment and so - called sensitive technologies to the energy sector could hamper @entity4 plans to further exploit its massive oil and gas reserves			0
presumably the @entity25 hopes that for everyone 's sake the crisis surrounding @entity6 will be solved by then			0
but in the meantime , if the @entity25 intends to send the strong message it needs , its leaders must reconcile their wish to make a point with the potential to lose a few points off of their gdp			0

the @entity2 has struggled to show a united front against @entity4 with sanctions
the downing of @entity147 is a turning point , as @entity10 leaders prepare decisive steps
but they must be prepared to hurt their own economies to *punish* @entity4
