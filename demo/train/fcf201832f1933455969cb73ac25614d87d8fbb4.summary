-- the global oil market is on tenterhooks as a result of the violent @entity4 insurgency sweeping down from northern @entity5 and threatening @entity6			1
@entity5 has the world 's fourth - largest oil reserves and the uncertainty has pushed the price of the global benchmark , @entity12 , up 10 % in the last two weeks to as high as $ 115 a barrel			1
oil has hit a nine - month high and is close to what many would consider an economic danger zone			0
another $ 10 spike could undermine growth from the @entity20 to @entity21 by pushing up the cost of transportation and production			0
but the real acid test for the market is unfolding now , as the @entity28 militants enter @entity30 's former territorial stronghold around the @entity32 refinery			1
and markets are pricing in a potential supply risk -- including the possibility of a divided @entity5			1
@entity32 is a sprawling complex with a refining capacity of 290 thousand barrels a day , according to the former head of energy studies at @entity40			1
the battle for @entity32 , with conflicting reports of who is in control , is indicative of what is wrong in @entity5			1
there is no cohesive national strategy that brings together @entity4 , @entity48 and @entity49			0
the national petroleum law has been parked within @entity5 's parliament for five years			1
the bill would finally establish a revenue sharing agreement for national production from the @entity48 south to the @entity56 north , and eventually the under - explored south - western corner of the country			0
the government of prime minister @entity60 , as @entity20 secretary of state @entity61 said in his bi-lateral meeting monday , has been unable to unite @entity5			1
one could argue the country 's oil bounty has been a blockade in efforts to find a resolution			1
@entity5 has been a growing force in the markets			1
the executive director of the @entity72 recently described it as a country with the last of the " easy oil			2
" it is not difficult to find or to produce and it is plentiful , but last week she noted its " expansion looks increasingly at risk , " in the @entity82 's @entity81			0
the country sits on an estimated 143 billion barrels of proven reserves			2
@entity86 output hit a 35 - year high of 3.6 million barrels day this year , placing @entity5 right behind @entity88 , within @entity40			2
last year , @entity5 's deputy prime minister for energy @entity89 told me of aspirations to hit 12 million barrels a day in the next decade , which would put it head - to - head with @entity96 heavyweight @entity88			2
the @entity82 is suggesting about half of that level would be an ambitious target			0
but the market is far more cautious , and is pricing in a severe interruption to those production plans			0
there is , indeed , a " new reality " on the ground , as @entity104 , president of the @entity105 , told @entity20 secretary of state @entity61 tuesday			0
not knowing how the @entity28 insurgency will play out , or who will control refining capacity , could favor @entity48 - controlled facilities around @entity113 in the south and @entity56 - controlled production blocks in the north			1
a " who 's who " of big oil names -- @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 of @entity124 and @entity125 -- operate out of both areas			2
further upset will send significant ripples through the world markets			0
executives i have spoken to say they have not yet suffered security breaches , but that they have set up private forces to protect oil assets			0
the executives speak of evacuation plans that are in place , but at this stage do not believe they will be needed			0
but , as @entity104 has said , @entity5 is in a new reality .			0

the global oil market is on tenterhooks as the @entity28 insurgency sweeps @entity5
oil prices are rising as markets take in risk -- and the chances of a split @entity5
the country has huge oil reserves which have so far *escaped* major upset
but the insurgency has now reached @entity32 , a key oil refinery
