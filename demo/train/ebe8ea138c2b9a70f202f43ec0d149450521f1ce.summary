in july , @entity0 , an online newsite focused on data mining and analytics software , ran an unusual listing in its jobs section			0
" we are looking for @entity8 and @entity9 , at both the senior and junior level , to join our department through november 2012 at our @entity13 , " read the ad			0
" we are a multi-disciplinary team of statisticians , predictive modelers , data mining experts , mathematicians , software developers , general analysts and organizers - all striving for a single goal : re-electing president @entity22			1
" the job listing caught the attention of @entity25 , a @entity27 data - mining expert at @entity28			1
he tweeted a link to the ad , commenting , " the @entity22 campaign is taking # bigdata seriously ; what about the @entity27 candidates ? " the question almost answers itself			1
so far in the presidential election of 2012 , there is only one campaign that is doing cutting - edge work with data			1
@entity22 may be struggling in the polls and even losing support among his core boosters , but when it comes to the modern mechanics of identifying , connecting with and mobilizing voters , as well as the challenge of integrating voter information with the complex internal workings of a national campaign , his team is way ahead of the @entity27 pack			1
facebook apps and other tools alone among the major candidates running for president , the @entity22 campaign not only has a @entity60 page with 23 million " likes " ( roughly 10 times the total of all the @entity27 running ) , it has a @entity60 app that is scooping up all kinds of juicy facts about his supporters			1
users of the @entity22 2012 - are you in ? app are not only giving the campaign personal data like their name , gender , birthday , current city , religion and political views , they are sharing their list of friends and information those friends share , like their birthday , current city , religion and political views			1
as @entity60 is now offering the geo - targeting of ads down to zip code , this kind of fine - grained information is invaluable			0
inside the @entity22 operation , his staff members are using a powerful social networking tool called @entity97 , which enables everyone to share what they are working on			1
modeled on @entity60 , the tool connects all levels of staff to the information they are gathering as they work on tasks like signing up volunteers , knocking on doors , identifying likely voters and dealing with problems			1
managers can set goals for field organizers -- number of calls made , number of doors knocked -- and see , in real time , how people are doing against all kinds of metrics			0
in additional to all the hard data , users can share qualitative information : what points or themes worked for them in a one - on - one conversation with voters , for example			2
" ups , " " downs " and " solutions " are color - coded , so people can see where successes are happening or challenges brewing			0
and unlike an open social network , where everyone is equal , @entity97 runs on a hierarchical social graph : higher - level staff get a broader view of the state and local work below them			1
for a campaign that tapped the volunteer energies of millions of people in 2008 and appears to need all the help it can get in 2012 , these kinds of fine - grained technologies could make a key difference			2
while the @entity27 field ( and bloggers and the press ) has been focused on how their candidates are doing with social networking , @entity22 's campaign operatives are devising a new kind of social intelligence that will help drive campaign resources where they are most needed			1
' data harmonization ' it all sounds like common sense , but actually , connecting and synchronizing the data a campaign collects from its field operation , fundraising operation and web operation is n't a trivial task			1
" the holy grail of data analysis is data harmonization , or master data management , " @entity25 said			0
" to have political talking to finance and finance talking to field , and data is flowing back and forth and informing the actions of each other -- it sounds easy , but it 's incredibly hard to implement			2
" most political campaigns tend to rely on consultants to carry out part or all of these functions , resulting in even greater obstacles to sharing information			0
like @entity25 , @entity27 technology consultant @entity185 is worried			2
his firm , @entity186 , built @entity188 's 2008 web operation and works closely with the tea party movement			2
this year , it did some work on @entity193 's website until that campaign folded			2
@entity185 's flagship project is a conservative social - networking hub called @entity197 , which has grown to 150,000 members in a matter of months by giving right - wing activists tools to organize local meetings and discussions			1
@entity185 does n't think any of the @entity27 presidential campaigns fully understand the power of data today			1
" they have to stop seeing a website as a piece of direct mail that people will receive , " he said			0
" they have to see a website as the equivalent of a campaign office in @entity215 , one that is open 24/7			0
" and campaigns need to know how to take quick and well - targeted action to respond to every expression of interest they may get online , he argues , because voter interest in politicians is fickle			2
simply sending a generic e-mail reply is n't enough			0
" if you can make that initial response a phone call from someone in their town or a neighbor , asking them to come to a county fair tomorrow , that 's much more powerful			0
" power of personal connections without good data management , the different legs of a national campaign can trip over each other			2
" one hand does n't know what the other hand is doing quite often in campaigns , " @entity25 said			0
" with master data management across a campaign , you can see how often you 're talking to a person " and thus not bombard them with untimely or poorly targeted requests			0
but , according to @entity185 , " not many on the @entity27 side know how to technically accomplish that			0
" their approach to the @entity257 , he adds , is still too much shaped by pre-internet politicking using broadcast advertising			0
" the ability to connect to people on a one - to - one basis , and encourage them to connect with one another , is way more powerful than that			0
" how powerful ? the 2008 @entity22 campaign offered an early glimpse of the potential of data - driven politics			1
by the end of the election , it had amassed 13 million supporter e-mail addresses , collected nearly 4 million individual donations and tallied about 2 million registered users on @entity276 , the campaign 's social networking platform			1
seventy thousand @entity280 members had used the site to conduct their own personalized fundraising campaigns			0
since 2008 , enthusiasm for @entity22 has waned , but his online presence has n't			2
his base on @entity60 has soared nearly six times from the 4 million he had on @entity287 , and his following on @entity288 now stands at 10 million , dwarfing the @entity27 field			0
so even if @entity22 is n't drawing millions of people off their sofas to rally to his side on their own in 2012 , his team has a huge amount of raw data to work with as they build his re-election machine			1
if the 2012 election comes down to a battle of inches , where a few percentage points change in turnout in a few key states making all the difference , we may come to see @entity22 's investment in predictive modelers and data scientists as the key to victory .			1

in the mechanics of identifying voters , president @entity22 's team is ahead of @entity27 rivals
@entity22 's re-election campaign is the only one doing cutting - edge work with data
president 's operation uses a powerful social - networking tool called @entity97
expert : @entity27 presidential campaigns do n't fully understand power of data *crunching*
