@entity0 , @entity1 -- i am a @entity4 veteran and i was once homeless and struggling with addiction			1
after i got out of the service , i was introduced to alcohol and drugs			2
i ended up on the street where i lived in drug houses , and saw shootings and crime of all types			2
the places i encountered when i was looking for a safe haven were no better than the streets			1
that 's when the commitment in my heart to help homeless veterans was born			1
i 've since dedicated my life to this cause			1
in 1994 i founded a nonprofit organization , @entity24 , with another formerly homeless veteran , the late @entity25			1
in may 2000 , the vision became a reality and the doors to @entity28 , a transitional living facility for homeless male veterans , opened			1
after being named a @entity33 @entity32 in 2009 , i was able to complete my vision of providing a resource center that provides housing and services for women as well			1
about a quarter of homeless adults in this country are veterans , according to the @entity43 , yet the @entity44 shows veterans represent only 10 percent of the civilian population			1
studies vary because homeless populations are difficult to count , but on any given night , from 107,000 to 300,000 veterans are homeless			1
in the early years , we were mainly helping older vets			1
now , we are seeing younger men , some in their 20s , many who have served in the war on terror , needing help			2
they may have different struggles from the older vets , but they still benefit from the same camaraderie			1
these men are also struggling with mental and physical illnesses , addictions and other issues related to combat , service and life			1
they also get help with the interpersonal problems they cause			2
we help them regain their lives , just like regained mine			2
i not only wanted to help homeless veterans , i wanted to help them before they became homeless , before they have to live through what i did			1
my charity in @entity0 , @entity1 , assists veterans , soldiers , and their families by providing supportive services , financial assistance , housing , mental health service referrals and more			1
i do what i do because i am one of them			0
it 's as simple as that			0
i practice what we are taught in the service , that no man should be left behind			0
we are still brothers - in - arms			0
our " @entity102 , " @entity92 , helps with emergency financial aid , referrals , @entity97 - @entity96 benefit information , employment assistance , and more , regardless of where the veterans live or service members are stationed			0
for example , in early 2008 , foreclosure rates in military communities increased at four times the national average			0
veterans lead the nation in homelessness , substance abuse , depression and suicide , according the secretary of the @entity97			2
for veterans , especially those who have recently come back from active duty , the search for a job can be harder than it is for civilians			0
skills learned in service or honed on the battlefield are not easily translated to the regular job market			0
add to that the need for a period of readjustment to civilian life and dealing with physical and mental injuries			1
earlier this year , the unemployment rate for both male and female vets from the wars in @entity133 and @entity134 was significantly higher than that of nonveterans , according to the @entity137			2
according to the @entity97 , between 6,500 and 7,000 female vets in the @entity139 are homeless , with almost nowhere for them to get help -- especially when compared with the number of facilities for homeless male veterans			1
it does n't make sense when you look at the numbers			0
women are four times more likely to end up homeless than their male counterparts			2
they make up around 15 percent of all veterans ; 11 percent of @entity155 and @entity156 vets are women , 40 percent of active duty females have children , and 11 percent are single parents			2
many women are losing custody of their kids because of their active duty status and deployment			0
our @entity166 's housing program provides temporary housing and support services for these at - risk and homeless female veterans , with and without children , and families of soldiers and veterans			1
my commitment and my day does not end with my charity			0
i am a member of the @entity179 and @entity0 veterans @entity180			0
i have helped with the burials of indigent veterans			0
i am also opening a local @entity184 to help prevent veterans from cycling through the courts and to get them the help they really need			0
many have resorted to drug use and other negative behaviors to deal with their combat and service experience , and wind up in our criminal justice system			0
in fact , i just got the news that our first case will be heard there on november 18			0
helping our veterans and seeing them happy makes it all worth it			0
no man or woman will be left behind as long as we are this nation			0
that is why i do what i do 24 - 7 - 365			0
is n't that what our veterans have done and continue to do for all of us ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			1
