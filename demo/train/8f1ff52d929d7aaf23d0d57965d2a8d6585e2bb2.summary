-- anyone who has ever been unemployed understands that unemployment insurance is a lifeline for the jobless and their families			1
but that lifeline is now slipping away for the long - term unemployed , as cuts to federal unemployment extensions enacted by @entity8 earlier this year gradually take hold			1
since february , more than 400,000 workers in 25 states have lost access to the federal extended benefits program , which previously provided a final 13 to 20 weeks of unemployment insurance to the longest - term unemployed			1
another 70,000 unemployed workers in @entity16 , @entity17 , and @entity18 , are on the chopping block for june			0
by the time the program is phased out in september , half a million workers in 35 states will have lost these crucial final weeks of unemployment insurance			2
on top of that , the other federal unemployment extension program -- emergency unemployment compensation , which currently helps 2.6 million @entity28 with 34 to 53 weeks of benefits â € ” will be dramatically scaled back beginning in june			0
the retrenchment in this program will immediately harm workers in 24 states , and will reduce or cut off benefits for hundreds of thousands of jobless @entity28 over the rest of the year			0
most alarmingly , those workers who lose jobs in july and thereafter may end up with no federal help if the program permanently expires at the end of the year as scheduled			0
these figures do n't even account for the millions of workers who have already run out of all state and federal unemployment insurance and still can not find work			1
the cuts to unemployment insurance are coming way faster than the rate at which the economy is improving			1
newly released employment figures show that the @entity28 added only 69,000 jobs in may , and the unemployment rate has risen to 8.2 % from 8.1 %			2
jobs remain scarce , with more than three job seekers for every one opening			0
but what distinguishes this last recession and its slow recovery is the unprecedented level of long - term unemployment			1
of our nation 's more than 12.7 million unemployed , more than 5 million -- 42 % -- have been out of work for six months or longer			2
nearly one in three have been out of work for more than a year			0
the average unemployed worker has been out of work for 39.7 weeks , or roughly nine months			0
most state unemployment insurance programs cover the first 26 weeks , or six months , of unemployment , normally enough time for the vast majority of unemployed to find new work			2
but this was no ordinary recession			0
with long - term unemployment so severe , @entity8 acted in 2009 to expand the federal unemployment programs , ultimately extending benefits to up to 99 weeks in the states with the highest unemployment rates			1
since then , the recession officially came to an end and the fledgling recovery has sputtered along , but long - term unemployment remains a problem that just wo n't go away			1
@entity8 and the administration seem hard - pressed to agree to do anything constructive about it , however			0
as the problem persisted , political scrapping about unemployment insurance has increased , and in february , @entity8 enacted a plan to dramatically scale back federal unemployment benefits , the consequences of which we are seeing now			1
we are pulling the rug out from under the unemployed too soon , to the detriment of unemployed workers and their families			0
never before has @entity8 cut back on extended unemployment insurance when the unemployment rate remains so high			1
today , less than half of the unemployed in this country are receiving unemployment insurance , and that percentage is decreasing rapidly			2
that puts more families at risk of falling into homelessness and poverty , and it means that one of the most effective forms of local economic stimulus is n't being used			0
opponents of extended unemployment insurance argue that it prolongs joblessness and becomes a disincentive for finding work			2
it 's a false claim that seizes on unfair stereotypes and stigmas of the unemployed , in the classic vein of blaming and punishing the victim			0
in fact , research shows that unemployment insurance helps keep jobless workers attached to the labor market so that they 're not dropping out and giving up			2
and as we know from real life , surviving on the average weekly benefit of $ 300 is hardly a picnic			0
if the measure of a nation is how it treats its least fortunate , we are looking into the abyss			2
we need to think hard about whether we are prepared to relegate the long - term unemployed to the status of collateral damage in an economic catastrophe			1
if we are going to achieve a true recovery , we can not leave the hardest - hit behind			1
what can our leaders in @entity18 do ? they need to provide meaningful jobs programs and hiring incentives that target the long - term unemployed			1
they need to make it unlawful to discriminate against the unemployed in hiring			0
and they need to make sure , as long as the number of unemployed remains so high , that workers have the minimal income support that unemployment insurance can provide to keep their families going until they find that next job			1
we are not out of the woods			0
the recovery has eluded long - term unemployed @entity28			1
for their sake , @entity8 must not allow what remains of federal unemployment insurance , the @entity155 program , to expire at the end of the year			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			0

unemployment insurance is set to expire for the long - term unemployed
@entity163 : unemployment rate is so high , we can not leave the hardest - hit behind
she says if measure of a nation is how it treats its *unfortunate* , we 're looking into abyss
