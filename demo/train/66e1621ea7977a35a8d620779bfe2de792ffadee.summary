-- at first glance , the death of @entity2 seemed to be a straightforward example of ugly , racial conflict resulting in the killing of an innocent black teenager by a white man , @entity8			1
but now , as evidence continues to come forward , the facts seem much more complicated and the " obvious truth " premature			2
at first , it was thought that @entity8 , a neighborhood watch captain , was the aggressor because he followed @entity2 , got into a physical scuffle with him and shot him			1
but then , some witnesses claim that @entity2 attacked @entity8 first , and the initial police report said that @entity8 had blood on his nose and the back of his head after the incident			1
however , surveillance video footage that surfaced from the police station is leading to questions about the extent of @entity8 's injuries			1
to make matters more complex , we found out that in the past several months , @entity2 was suspended from school three times , once for the possession of drug paraphernalia			1
the @entity33 reported that in the gated community in which @entity8 patrolled , there were eight burglaries , nine thefts and one shooting in the past year			1
neighbors of @entity8 described him as being passionate about security and credit him with thwarting and cracking some crimes			1
it was also revealed that @entity8 identified himself as a @entity45 and was a registered @entity46			1
the facts are confounding and inconclusive			0
but the tendency in the first days by some , including @entity50 , @entity51 and an angry chorus of followers , was to rush to judgment with little regard for fairness , due process , or respect for the terrible death of a young man			1
a mob mentality seems to be in the ascendancy			0
@entity63 offered a bounty for @entity8 's capture			1
@entity51 said that @entity2 's death shows how " blacks are under attack " and " targeting , arresting , convicting blacks and ultimately killing us is big business			1
" apart from the obvious incendiary nature of such comments , what in heaven 's name could @entity51 mean ? @entity76 fueled the flames by tweeting @entity8 's home address , which turned out to be the wrong address and resulted in an older couple fleeing from their home and fearing for their lives after threats and crowds outside their residence			2
@entity76 , realizing his folly , has since apologized to the couple			0
these actions and words illustrate a problem in dealing with @entity2 's death : many people are not on an impartial hunt for justice but are exploiting this crisis for personal or political gain and claiming that it is representative of larger societal problems			1
@entity101 political analyst and @entity103 fundraiser @entity100 blamed @entity2 's death on @entity104			1
she said , " [ @entity104 politicians ] reinforce and validate old stereotypes that associate the poor and welfare as criminal behavior with african - americans and people of color , calling us lazy , undeserving recipients of public assistance			0
in the case of @entity2 , those festering stereotypes had lethal consequences			2
" @entity2 's own mother , @entity119 , filed applications for trademarks on two of the popular phrases used at rallies for @entity2 , " @entity125 " and " justice for @entity2			1
" @entity103 politicized the event with a hearing on @entity129 in which @entity2 's parents testified			2
later , @entity132 rep. @entity131 , @entity133 , wore a hoodie on the @entity136 floor			0
it 's clear that some of the people raising the most noise are trying to make this less about the horrible death of a young man and more about claims of racial resentment that may or may not exist			0
the loudest voices should be particularly careful not to rush to conclusions			2
remember the @entity148 lacrosse case , in which members of the team were accused of a gang rape			0
the public rushed to judgment long before the young men were eventually acquitted			0
@entity8 may or may not be guilty ; there may or may not be racial motivations			1
we do not know yet			0
in the absence of complete evidence , inflammatory comments and belligerent reactions will not aid the search for justice			0
an angry crowd should not be in charge			0
lastly , why is there so much selective outrage on the part of so many ? the leading cause of death for black male teenagers is homicide , according to the @entity173			0
of all the black homicide victims , about 93 % are killed by other black people			0
in 2011 , nearly 85 % of all people murdered in @entity177 were black			0
where are the marches and protests for these victims ? is it justice people seek or are they looking and even hoping for signs of white racism so they can exploit it ? in his letter from a @entity190 , @entity188 wrote , " any law that uplifts human personality is just			2
any law that degrades human personality is unjust			0
" while we wait and respect due process of law , we should do our part to uplift human personality			0
we can do so by giving both @entity2 and @entity8 a just weighing of the evidence , both in the court of law and public opinion			1
let us not assume the worst of anybody but be guided by the facts			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			2

@entity209 : the death of @entity2 is much more complex than first thought
@entity209 : some are not looking for justice , but are exploiting this terrible death
he says we do *n't* know if @entity8 is guilty or if racism was a motivating factor
@entity209 : we should not rush to conclusions , and should be guided by the facts
