and i did n't think @entity1 , the @entity2 chief who caused quite a stir with her two - week maternity leave and decision to ban employees working from home , could get any more controversial			1
enter her decision to strike a pose in the september issue of @entity11 , lounging on a hammock wearing @entity13 and stiletto heels , and let the debate , mostly among women , rage on			1
" smart women can be beautiful , " said @entity18 of the blog , defining my @entity20			0
" beautiful women can be leaders of industry			0
women should not have to succumb to societal pressure dictating what they are ' allowed ' to be and do			0
" i happen to agree with @entity18 's sentiment , but other women saw @entity30 's pose as a step backward			1
" we fight so hard to be where we are and prove that it was n't our cute bodies , perky boobs or cute face that got us there , " said self - described " pretty geek , " @entity41 , in response to a request for comment on @entity46 's facebook page			0
" shame on you @entity1 for playing into stereotypes			2
" but ca n't a woman be powerful , strong and beautiful , all at once ? that question drew a range of responses from women on various rungs of the corporate ladder , some supportive of @entity30 embracing her femininity and others lamenting the undue pressure on female leaders to soften their image			1
@entity2 's @entity1 turns heads with @entity11 photo shoot for many women , the fact that there 's even a debate about @entity30 's decision to do the @entity11 photo shoot in the first place shows that a double standard is alive and well			1
" why are women always being held to a different level of scrutiny in the business and tech space ? " said @entity71 , senior editor of @entity72			0
" so what if @entity78 loves fashion ? would we think less of @entity82 being photographed with his monster boat ... or @entity84 with his hot air balloons ? " @entity86 , author of the book " tweak it : make what matters to @entity89 , " said , " my hope is that someday we 're not batting an eye at ceo women being in @entity11 , as we do n't bat an eye on ceo men being in outside magazine talking about how they climbed @entity97			1
" @entity1 : from @entity99 ' geek ' to @entity2 ceo @entity100 , creator of a beauty , fashion and lifestyle site for women of color called @entity106 , believes @entity30 has the right to present herself any way she sees fit , but says sadly , mainstream media showcases women and men differently			1
" i ca n't think of the last time a men 's magazine chose to profile a ceo by asking him to sprawl out on a couch , " she said			2
" when , let 's say , @entity119 or @entity120 is profiling someone on this level , they 're not asking them to unbutton their shirt and pose suggestively with any kinds of props			0
" the response from @entity30 's fellow female ceos and female executives was also telling			1
@entity130 , who only wanted to use her first name and initial of her last name , is a chief marketing officer who worked in the tech industry at companies ranging from @entity136 to @entity137 to @entity2			2
her position is n't one based on sexism , she says , but on her views about the best way for a ceo to benefit his or her company			0
how @entity1 writes her own rules " the pose that @entity1 took for ... @entity11 is not one that a man would take or that seems to be beneficial for @entity2 , " she said in response to a post on @entity46 's facebook page			1
" i am fine with her using her good looks or her smarts or her role as a ceo and mother to help folks take a new look at @entity2			1
however , this @entity11 ( photo ) looks to be much more about @entity1 being sexy as a woman rather than @entity1 looking great as ceo of a company desperately trying to remain relevant			1
" @entity160 , vice president for product management for @entity162 , said she would n't have posed for @entity11 as an executive			2
" this is something i would n't personally do because i believe if you want to be treated equal , you should n't take advantage of your physical assets , " said @entity164			0
" i do n't want to get brownie points because i am attractive			0
i like to separate the fact that i am a woman and i am a professional			0
" other women in leadership positions said they saw no problem with @entity30 showing a different side of her personality			2
" so what if @entity1 is in a fashion spread in @entity11 ? " said @entity177 , ceo of @entity178			1
" when she ' took office ' did she also park her sense of fashion , personal interests , and humor at the front door ? i hope she had fun on the photo shoot and she looks great to boot ! " for some women , the issue is not what @entity30 did but what she said			1
in the @entity11 article , the @entity2 ceo said she did n't set out to lead technology companies			1
" i 'm just geeky and shy and i like to code			0
... it 's not like i had a grand plan where i weighed all the pros and cons of what i wanted to do -- it just sort of happened , " she told the magazine			0
" you do n't become a female ceo of a tech company for just stumbling onto a career , and you certainly do n't end up in @entity11 for those reasons either , " said @entity202 , a writer of the feminist blog , @entity204 , and mom of two			1
" @entity30 has embraced all of her horrible work ethics ... putting a kabosh on the work - from - home environment so why not embrace her aggressive side and tell the truth about who she is ? " if @entity1 can ' have it all , ' can you ? in the midst of all the back and forth were questions from some women about why we women are often ripping each other apart			1
after all , women have been some of the loudest critics of @entity30			2
" she 's not doing a spread in @entity231 , " said @entity227 , author of " @entity228			0
" " it 's not at all inappropriate			2
what 's inappropriate is judging her			2
" @entity235 , @entity236 's career expert , said , " the thought that women can be glamorous , beautiful and successful is really difficult for women to embrace because i think in large part it 's hard			0
it 's really hard to be all those things at once and it feels kind of threatening			0
" follow @entity245 on @entity246 and like @entity247 on @entity248 .			0
