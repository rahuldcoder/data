" more flight attendants should say that to more passengers			1
this might seem like heresy to the millions of travelers who enjoy free drinks in the upper classes and on international flights , but maybe it 's time airlines consider putting a cap on drinks , or charging passengers for their alcohol after the first drink or two			1
recently , @entity19 , niece of fashion designer @entity20 , was allegedly misbehaving on a @entity22 flight after getting " dangerously drunk " and abusive toward other passengers			1
it got so bad that the @entity26 bound plane made an unscheduled stop in @entity28 to remove her from the flight			0
she was arrested for endangering other passengers			0
let 's not be shocked by this			1
these days , a month does n't go by that i do n't hear about an intoxicated passenger getting into fights with flight crews or their fellow travelers			2
the @entity19 episode is fresh in our memory , but drunks on planes are nothing new			0
a few years ago , @entity47 actor @entity46 made the headlines when he , allegedly drunk , urinated in the aisle during an @entity51 flight from @entity52 to @entity53 , @entity28			0
and let 's not forget " @entity56 " star @entity55 , who was banned from flying on @entity57 after drinking heavily in the carrier 's first class lounge in a flight from @entity26 to @entity61			2
the crew noticed he had become belligerent and disruptive , so they refused to let him board the flight to @entity65 in an august 2013 report on unruly passengers , the @entity66 , which represents airlines from around the world , noted that " many " carriers said alcohol was the major contributor to disruptive behavior			1
" they observed that passengers , in numerous instances , may have been intoxicated at the time of boarding the aircraft or had access to their own alcohol supply on board			0
" similarly , the @entity83 - based @entity82 to @entity84 said air rage tends to occur in unfamiliar and over-stimulating environments , including airports and airplanes			0
the rage is fueled by " overcrowding , delays , lack of information , lack of manners and boorish behavior , as well as arguments with transportation or service personnel			0
" furthermore , " heightened stress levels , alcohol and drug misuse , as well as smoking prohibitions in many public places , are common factors inciting rage			0
" unfortunately , some travelers choose alcohol before and during a flight , and in extreme cases , end up in conflicts with passengers and crew and attempt to open emergency exits and even storm the cockpit			1
the bottom line is flight crews and passengers need to be more mindful			1
flight attendants , like it or not , are the final line of defense when it comes to drunk passengers			1
they need to be empowered to cut off passengers when a fellow traveler brings up a legitimate complaint or if they see bad behaviors escalating			0
and in our post- 9/11 travel world , passengers are much more willing to help flight crews with unruly passengers in case there is n't an air marshal aboard			2
those who choose to drink excessively and become abusive not only should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law , but they also need to be sued to recover the costs for any diversion or damages they may cause others during their inebriated state			1
there are always travelers who will drink , whether it 's free or not			2
by imposing fees and / or limits on the number of drinks , airlines would not only reduce alcohol consumption , but also make a profit from a common - sense regulation			1
maintaining good order during flights is one of the best ways that airlines can serve their customers well			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			2

@entity164 : let 's not be shocked by drunken passengers misbehaving on planes
@entity162 : @entity170 passengers who become abusive should be prosecuted
she says flight attendants are the last line of defense against inebriated travelers
@entity162 : airlines should also impose fees and / or limit on the number of drinks
