-- many a modern president has lost momentum and suffered what are termed " scandals " in his second term			1
president @entity7 's current problems are part of that tradition			1
but with the exception of @entity12 , scandals have not proven fatal			0
indeed , @entity14 's @entity13 and @entity16 's impeachment over the @entity18 affair were far more serious than what we know so far about @entity7 's involvement in @entity22 , the @entity23 or subpoenas of records of reporters ' calls			1
yet @entity14 and @entity16 finished their second terms as popular presidents			0
@entity32 's founding fathers created a system of government deliberately designed to protect liberties rather than be efficient			0
they feared giving the chief executive too much power and constrained the president with checks and balances to limit his actions			0
as one wag put it , the system ensured that @entity45 could not rule over us , nor for that matter , could anyone else			0
one partial exception was foreign policy , where the inherent powers of the commander - in - chief give the president somewhat more constitutional leeway than in domestic policy			1
according to conventional wisdom , this situation leads lame duck , second - term presidents to turn their attention to foreign policy where they have a better chance of creating a second - term legacy			1
but it 's not that simple			0
much of a president 's second term depends upon unpredictable external events			1
for example , during his first term , @entity68 made every effort to stay out of @entity72 , and he won re-election in 1916 on that promise			2
but within six months , @entity76 's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare and meddling in @entity79 led @entity68 to send @entity81 troops to fight in @entity82 -- an enormous departure from the @entity81 tradition of avoiding conflicts outside the @entity86			2
and after 1938 , @entity87 decided that @entity88 posed a threat to the @entity81 , but he was unable to convince an isolationist @entity81 public to enter @entity91 until the @entity92 solved his problem by attacking @entity94 at the end of 1941			2
@entity14 's case is also instructive			0
his tough rhetoric toward the @entity98 was the hallmark of his first term , and he won a massive re-election victory in 1984			0
yet in 1985 , after @entity101 came to power , @entity14 had the intuition and emotional intelligence to recognize at their first summit in @entity107 that @entity101 -- unlike the inept @entity98 leaders that preceded him -- was a man with whom he could do business			0
the real success of @entity14 's foreign policy was not the tough talk , but the ability to cash in on it by reaching deals that were @entity117			1
yet ironically , @entity14 almost lost his presidency and his place in history because of careless management that allowed his subordinates to transfer arms for hostages in @entity125 and use the proceeds to violate congressional laws against providing funds to the @entity129 in @entity32			0
@entity7 's first term was marked by the passage of health care legislation -- unpopular with some , but a historic accomplishment that @entity135 presidents have sought since the days of @entity136			1
the @entity135 ' loss of the @entity138 in the 2010 elections has constrained @entity7 's ability to advance other transformational efforts on the domestic front , though some believe that , out of self - interest , the @entity144 may still allow bipartisan reform of immigration law during @entity7 's second term			1
the current " scandals " certainly are expensive to @entity7 in terms of daily distraction and lost political momentum , but if you think you can write off the rest of the @entity7 presidency , think again			1
too often , @entity156 focuses so myopically on daily political battles that it fails to pay attention to history			2
the lessons of history tell us : it is too soon to write off @entity7			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			0

@entity167 : many presidents lose momentum with second - term scandals
so some try foreign policy , where constitution gives more chance to make legacy , he says
@entity167 : @entity68 , @entity87 , others found external events can upend plans for foreign policy legacy
@entity167 : if you **'re** writing off @entity7 's second term , you **'re** not paying attention to history 's lessons
