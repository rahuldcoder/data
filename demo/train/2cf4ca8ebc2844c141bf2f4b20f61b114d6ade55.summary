-- " @entity1 " has become the new definition of " hate - watching			1
" anyone with a @entity6 account has noticed the tidal wave of tweets about @entity10 's tv event , which aired for three hours on thursday night , but that ca n't exactly be taken as a good sign			1
( you know a tv show is n't going well when live tweets from @entity16 are considered one of the best parts			1
) from the moment @entity10 announced its live tv version of the @entity23 classic , a number of " @entity20 " fans responded with a resounding " why ? ! " so when the network unveiled its one - take - only " @entity20 " on thursday -- starring @entity26 and @entity27 in the untouchable roles of @entity29 and captain @entity30 -- it seems viewers were primed to tear the production to shreds from its opening note			1
and shred it they did			0
critics have commended country star @entity36 for attempting live theater without acting experience , but they have n't been able to ignore the result			1
" as her multiple @entity44 and her legion of country music fans will attest , the quality of @entity36 's singing voice is not the problem , " said @entity41 's tv critic @entity40			1
" it 's that she does n't know how to use that voice to sing in character , or what to do with her face when she 's trying			2
" even though it 's been repeated that @entity10 was re-creating the stage version of " @entity20 , " rather than the beloved 1965 film starring @entity61 , the comparisons between the tv musical and the movie were inevitable			2
at one point , @entity36 had to go on the record to tell her critics that she 's completely aware she is not @entity61			1
" i would never pretend that i was , " the " @entity67 " champ recently told @entity68			0
" i know my place			0
" yet that place may not have been in such an iconic role			0
there are some things that are so revered in pop culture it 's nearly criminal to try to re-introduce them ( see : the widely reviled plan to create a sequel to " @entity79 " )			0
@entity36 is an undeniable talent , but the singer is now facing complaints for even attempting to portray the young nun			1
" when @entity26 stepped out on the ( wooded , not grassy ) hills and started singing , i wished the hills were alive with the sound of hungry mountain lions , " said @entity84 in a review			1
" why was n't she @entity61 ? is being @entity61 so much to ask for ? no chic pixie cut either			0
" the @entity93 wondered if it was " perhaps unfair to ask so much of @entity36 , to have to make @entity29 's journey in three scant hours			1
" and , to make matters worse , " @entity103 's " @entity95 -- so familiar to audiences as vampire @entity97 that some viewers found it difficult to see the actor as anyone else -- did n't live up to expectations , either			2
" @entity95 is a better singer than @entity107 , " said @entity106			0
" but he 's no @entity109			0
his attempt at conveying an emotional hollowness just reads as mildly constipated , his furrowed eyes and pursed lips doing all the work			0
he does n't look stoic , he just looks clenched			0
" so it was n't a home run			0
but that 's not to say that there were n't highlights , with @entity124 's spectacular performance being chief among them			2
some have emerged has defenders of the show -- the first attempt at a live tv musical production in almost 50 years -- while a few more have tweeted their hope that the intense criticism of the production wo n't stop @entity10 or other major broadcast networks from giving live theater in primetime another try			1
as for @entity36 , it sounds like she slept well after going off the air thursday			2
" glory to @entity141 tonight ... i could n't be more proud , " she tweeted			2
" what a tough thing to pull off and we did it ! i am so blessed ! ! ! "			0

" @entity1 " has been *eviscerated* on *twitter*
critics were n't in love with the live tv event either
