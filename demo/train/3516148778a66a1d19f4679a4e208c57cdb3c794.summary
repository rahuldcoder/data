-- " i do not use crack cocaine , nor am i an addict of crack cocaine			1
" those words are n't what might normally be expected from the mayor of @entity8 's largest city			1
but little is normal nowadays for @entity10			2
eight days ago , @entity11 and the @entity12 published stories stating their reporters had seen a cell - phone video showing @entity16 , as the @entity12 described it , " inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe			1
" later in the video as described by @entity20 , an " incoherent " man both the @entity12 and @entity11 claimed to be @entity16 ranted on a number of subjects , from @entity25 leader @entity24 to the high school football team he coached			1
except for a brief comment the next day deriding the stories as " ridiculous , " the characteristically voluble @entity29 mayor has been quiet -- at the advice of his lawyer , he said then , who advised him " not to say a word			2
" until friday , when he made a statement			0
in his statement , @entity16 alluded to the end of his time as a coach for the @entity45 high school team , as well as the departure of his mayoral chief of staff @entity47			2
he did n't elaborate on either relationship			0
nor did he admit to any wrongdoing -- saying there was no real proof that he did anything wrong			0
" i can not comment on a video that i have never seen or does not exist , " @entity10 said , referring to the 90 seconds of footage that two @entity58 reporters and one @entity11 journalist claimed to have seen but that has n't been aired on tv or posted online			1
" it is most unfortunate , very unfortunate , that my colleagues and the great people of this city have been exposed to the fact that i have been judged by the media without any evidence , " the mayor said			0
amid the media firestorm , @entity10 insisted that he 's still hard at work for the people of @entity29 , as a conservative leader focused on making the city government more efficient and effective			1
" we 're continuing to fight for the taxpayers every day and it 's business as usual at @entity79 , " he said			0
his demeanor friday was markedly different from the man @entity81 reporters described in the video , which the newspaper claimed was shot last winter			2
in it , the @entity58 journalists wrote that " an off - camera speaker ... goads the clearly impaired mayor , " who at one point seems to mutter , " everyone expects me to be right - wing			0
" the newspaper said that the mayor appears to refer to the players on his @entity96 football team as " just f --- ing minorities			0
" the video ends , according to @entity20 , when the cell phone starts to ring			0
" that phone better not be on , " the mayor says , according to the newspaper			0
@entity104 , a city councilor , stood behind his brother on friday -- and lashed out at the news reports			1
echoing the mayor , @entity104 questioned the @entity12 for its " accusation of a video that does not exist or we have n't seen			1
" the city councilor had especially harsh words for @entity11 , accusing it of dealing " with a bunch of extortionists " and unfairly tarnishing @entity113 who live in @entity29 by claiming @entity113 drug dealers were behind the video			1
" i think it 's disgusting , " @entity104 said .			0

new : @entity29 's deputy mayor blasts the news reports , calling one of them " disgusting "
@entity29 's mayor speaks at *length* for first time since being accused of *smoking* crack
