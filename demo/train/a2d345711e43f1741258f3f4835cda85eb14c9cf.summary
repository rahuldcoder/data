-- like many a pop culture aficionado , " @entity2 " star @entity1 read the @entity5 story on @entity6 / " @entity2 " over the weekend			1
but unlike many fans gobbling up the article for intel on @entity6 , her co-star @entity1 read the feature , which outlined @entity6 's love of chaos and inappropriate on - set behavior , with bemused wonder			1
" the best way i can describe [ the @entity5 article ] is actual life events reflected in a mirror and then retold for dramatic effect , " @entity1 said on the phone with @entity0 this morning			1
" it 's accurate enough that it ca n't be said that it 's not ; it 's not a lie			0
but it 's twisted enough that if you were actually there you 're like , ' wait			0
that 's not exactly what happened			0
' " what did actually happen was @entity1 ( real name @entity1 ) , affectionately known as ' the porn star next door ' with over 4,000 credits to his name , started hearing his name thrown around by screenwriter @entity40 on @entity41			1
@entity40 was looking for an actor for an upcoming noir thriller , and needed the person to be comfortable with a lot of nudity			2
what @entity1 did n't know at the time was the low - budget project that would become " @entity2 , " directed by @entity50 , would also be starring @entity6 â € ” and that equaled a lot of extra drama			1
@entity1 was n't all that familiar with @entity6			1
he 'd heard the stories about her self - destruction with drugs and alcohol , but he 'd never actually seen a @entity6 movie -- not even @entity60			2
so when @entity6 appeared for her first day on set with him -- late , as @entity61 wrote , @entity1 did n't know what to expect			1
there is audio floating around of the two of them arguing over a scene one day , with @entity1 saying he was doing " @entity2 " " for fun , " which seemed to anger @entity6 -- a convo @entity1 chalks up to a misunderstanding			1
" it 's just the delicate ego of the @entity75 person , " he said			0
" i 've learned that most people in the @entity75 mainstream world are so delicate , fragile and egotistical			0
[ comments like mine ] really f * * * with their heads			0
" @entity6 tweets trenchant @entity82 analysis one day on set that @entity1 is eager to talk about is the duo 's already - infamous sex scene , which would mark @entity6 's first on - camera nudity for a film			1
" the @entity5 said there were a bunch of other porn stars there , but that 's not right , " he said			2
" it was n't like we were all having sex and an orgy in the bedroom ! during rehearsal , everyone was talking the scene to death			2
i think the issue was every other [ cast member ] was so comfortable , it made @entity6 feel like she did n't matter			2
... i think @entity6 wanted [ the nudity ] to be a bigger deal than it was			2
[ she wanted the crew to be naked ] and they just laughed			0
so @entity50 is freaking out and then this is what actually happened : @entity50 looked her in the eye and said , ' i 'm not making my f * * * ing crew do that			0
but you know what ? ' strips his clothes off except for his socks , walks to the monitor , and says , ' action			0
' and @entity6 ran out from the closet , giggling like crazy , and we shot the scene			1
" 7 biggest @entity123 takeaways from the @entity5 story beyond the occasional flare - up , @entity1 said that he got along well with @entity6 , hanging out with her to build chemistry , and that for a bit after the shoot [ it concluded end of july ] they would continue to text			1
while they have different " lifestyles , " " she herself does n't bother me at all , " @entity1 said			2
" it 'll be interesting [ to see how the movie turns out ]			0
it might be really good ; it might be really strange			0
but either way , it 's going to be cool to watch			0
" as for what his own future holds post- " @entity2 , " @entity1 is n't concerned about getting past the porn - star label ( nor does he have any plans to stop making adult films and transition entirely to more mainstream fare )			1
" @entity75 is always going to see me as ' that porn guy , ' " he said			1
" there is no way to avoid it ... i do adult because it 's what i love			2
" but he is working on other projects in addition to shooting his scenes , most notably producing			0
he 's taken to @entity155 to get funding for a sci - fi western steampunk short called " @entity158			0
" " i 'm not going to be the next @entity159 or @entity160			0
i 'm that porn guy			1
and after [ " @entity2 " ] comes out , i 'm still going to be that porn guy			1
and maybe i 'll be that porn guy who gets offered a little indie every now and then			1
