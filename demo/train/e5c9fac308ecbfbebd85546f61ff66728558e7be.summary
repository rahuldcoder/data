that 's the message of monday 's rulings from the @entity5 -- and , indeed , all decisions by nine justices whose ideologies reflect , with considerable precision , the views of the presidents who appointed them			1
both the @entity15 case -- which concerned the intersection of women 's rights , religious freedom , and @entity19 -- and the @entity21 case , about the future of labor unions , were 5 - 4 decisions			1
five @entity26 appointees for the owners of @entity15 ( and against the unions )			1
four @entity30 appointees for the @entity32 administration ( and for the unions )			1
notably , too , three of those four @entity30 appointees are women			1
( of 112 people who have served on the @entity5 , four have been women			2
) as in so many cases before the justices , the legal issues in these cases were as much political as legal			0
indeed , just like politicians , the justices try to frame the questions before them in as politically appealing ways as they can			0
in @entity15 , the issue was whether a privately held company , whose owners have strong religious convictions against abortion , can refuse to pay for certain forms of birth control which they regard as immoral			2
" the owners of many closely held corporations could not in good conscience provide such coverage , " justice @entity52 wrote for the majority , and to force them to do so would violate federal law			0
justice @entity61 , for the dissenters , framed the issue in an entirely different way			0
she and her colleagues saw @entity15 as asking for -- and receiving -- a license from the court to discriminate against women			1
what , she asked , about companies that have religious objections to treating african - americans equally -- or gay people ? and , she asks , " how does the @entity5 divine which religious beliefs are worthy of accommodation , and which are not ? " the same kind of conflict undergirds the union case			0
in that case , home care workers who are covered by a union contract demanded the freedom to refuse to pay dues -- which the conservative majority granted them			0
is this , as @entity52 ( again ) held , simply a matter of preserving the freedom of speech rights of these employees ? or is it , as the dissenters , led by justice @entity90 , said , a vehicle to starve unions of the dollars they need to survive -- and negotiate precisely these kinds of contracts ? toward the end of this year 's term , there were more unanimous opinions than usual -- including rulings about the right of police officers to search the personal electronic devices of persons under arrest , and about the legitimacy of the use of recess appointments by the @entity32 administration			2
but no one should be misled			0
when it comes to the most fundamental issues before the court , the most important factor is not the legal arguments but the identity of the judges -- and the presidents who appointed them			2
@entity26 vote one way , @entity30 another			1
it 's true in @entity120 , and it 's true on the other side of @entity123 as well -- in the marble temple of the @entity5 .			0
