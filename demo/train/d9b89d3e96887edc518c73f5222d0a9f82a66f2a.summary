@entity0 -- power - driven wheelchairs are costing @entity3 and its beneficiaries nearly four times what suppliers pay for them , and competitive bidding could have reduced those costs , according to an inspector general 's report released wednesday			1
competitive bidding would have cut costs on a standard power wheelchair by nearly $ 1,000 , the report says			1
a standard power wheelchair costs the federal health insurance program for seniors an average of $ 4,018 to lease , compared with $ 1,048 for suppliers to buy , the @entity17 ' internal watchdog reported			1
" @entity3 and its beneficiaries paid suppliers an average of $ 2,970 beyond the supplier 's acquisition cost to perform an average of five services and cover general business costs , " the report found			2
the difference was not as dramatic for more advanced wheelchairs used for physical rehabilitation patients , but at an average lease of $ 11,507 , those chairs still cost @entity3 about twice as much as the $ 5,880 paid by suppliers , the report found			2
more than 173,000 @entity3 beneficiaries received power wheelchairs in the first half of 2007 , at a cost of about $ 686 million , the report said			0
the cost could have been reduced considerably had @entity41 not delayed a planned system of competitive bidding for what @entity3 classifies as " durable medical equipment , " such as wheelchairs and oxygen tanks , the report said			1
competitive bidding would have cut @entity3 's average cost of a standard power wheelchair by nearly $ 1,000 , the inspector general found			1
" @entity3 and beneficiary payments under the @entity53 would have decreased by an average of 26 percent across all included categories of [ durable medical equipment ] , saving up to an estimated $ 1 billion annually , " the report found			0
" however , @entity41 delayed the program and exempted complex rehabilitation power wheelchairs from future competitive bidding			0
" @entity3 's annual budget for 2008 was $ 444 billion			0
in january , it cut its payments to suppliers by 9.5 percent to make up for what it thought competitive bidding would have saved taxpayers , according to the report			2
in july , a @entity1 investigation found that a patient and taxpayers were billed about $ 1,200 over four years for a nonmotorized chair , while a nearly identical chair could be bought from the same supplier for $ 349			0
the issue has become controversial as the @entity75 administration tries to overhaul the @entity77 health care system and rein in the cost of @entity3			0
administration officials want to require competitive bids for items such as wheelchairs			0
but the @entity83 , which represents many in the durable equipment industry , said the bidding program would reduce patient choice , limit access to home medical care and drive up @entity3 costs by requiring more hospital stays .			1
