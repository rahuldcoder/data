@entity0 -- in november 2008 , after an ugly campaign that stirred emotions and split families along generational lines , @entity3 voters narrowly approved @entity8			1
the ballot initiative defined marriage as between a man and a woman and banned same - sex marriage in the @entity3			1
now , as the @entity15 hears arguments from those challenging the law 's constitutionality , we @entity3 have a message for the rest of the country : " oops			2
" a new @entity24 , released at the end of february , provides the evidence of what many of us here on the left coast have been sensing over the last 4Â½ years : when it comes to same - sex marriage , many @entity3 voters want a do - over			1
the survey shows that 61 % of @entity3 voters now approve of it , with 32 % opposed			2
the " pro " figure represents a big jump from 2008 when the @entity24 showed that 51 % of @entity3 voters approved of same sex - marriage			1
it 's part of what has been a gradual march toward greater public acceptance of same - sex marriage in a state that has struggled with this issue like no other in recent memory			1
i went through it myself			0
thirteen years ago , i opposed same - sex marriage and supported the watered - down alternative -- civil unions			1
as a practical matter , i thought activists should focus on things such as a federal civil rights bill outlawing private - sector discrimination due to sexual orientation			0
then a gay family member helped me see the light			0
i now understand that we ca n't have a two - tiered system , where some of us enjoy the right to marry and our brothers and sisters and cousins do n't , based solely on sexual orientation			0
opinion : straight marriage is the real issue @entity3 's struggle started about the same time			1
in 2000 , another ballot initiative -- @entity8 22 , which defined marriage as between a man and a woman -- was approved by 61 % of @entity3 voters			1
note that this is the same percentage that , in the current @entity24 , says they now support same - sex marriage			1
a lot can happen in 13 years			0
a state can turn itself inside out in 13 years			0
when the @entity3 @entity15 struck down @entity8 22 as inconsistent with the state constitution , opponents of gay marriage got crafty and proposed another initiative -- @entity8 , which went so far as to amend the state constitution to ban same - sex marriage			1
@entity3 voters approved the measure , 52 % to 48 % -- and in doing so , betrayed their own liberal reputation			2
share your reaction to the arguments think of the irony			0
on the very same day that a majority of voters in this dark blue state voted for the nation 's first @entity102 - @entity101 president , a majority also approved a ballot initiative that winked at bigotry			1
worse , supporters of the measure included a majority of @entity110 and @entity102 - @entity101 voters			1
they 're no stranger to discrimination , and so they should know better			0
maybe many of these voters of color got swept up in the same wave of fear and ignorance that swept across the rest of the state 's population			0
i live in @entity3 , and so i saw it all play out			2
for instance , there were , in the final days of the campaign , a despicable series of " yes on 8 " radio and television ads that took full advantage of bigotry 's old buddy -- fear			2
one of the main messages behind these ads was that , if same - sex marriage were legal , it would somehow creep its way into the public schools through the curriculum			1
opinion : the real ' modern family ' in @entity101 i remember one television ad that showed a little girl who hurried home from school and excitedly told her mother that she was reading a book about a prince who did n't marry a princess because he settled on marrying another prince			2
and so , she said with a big smile , when she grew up , she could marry a princess			0
the mother reacted with a panicked look			0
the spot did not make clear that @entity3 parents have the right to be notified if sexually explicit material is being taught and to pull their children out of class if they choose			1
but , as we have learned time and again , fear does n't listen to facts			0
but the good news is that fear usually loses its strength over time			0
and that is what happened here			0
and it happened here , across the board			0
in the new @entity24 for @entity3 , 64 % of african - americans and @entity172 and 56 % of @entity110 now support same - sex marriage			1
no one can say definitively why the numbers have shifted in @entity3			2
but the change of heart does seem to mirror a national trend where -- as more @entity101 discover or acknowledge that they have gays and lesbians among their friends and family -- their attitude toward same - sex marriage seems to be softening			1
a new @entity1 / @entity185 found evidence of something that analysts are calling the " @entity190 effect , " in reference to the @entity193 senator from @entity194 who changed his position on same - sex marriage after learning his son is gay			1
in the poll , 57 % of @entity101 now say that they have a family member or close friend who is gay or lesbian			2
that 's a 12 - point gain since 2007			0
meanwhile , over that same time period , the number of @entity101 who support same - sex marriage has gone up by almost exactly the same percentage			1
opinion : our journey with the @entity210 on gay rights this is either one heck of a coincidence or evidence that people come to support same - sex marriage as the issue begins to hit closer to home and they become aware that someone they care about is gay or lesbian			1
whatever is causing the shift , in @entity3 and throughout the @entity101 , let 's be thankful for it			1
the @entity15 will be taking a close look at @entity3 's @entity8 , and it is expected to hand down its ruling in june			2
speaking of this issue being close to home for many of us , among those attending the arguments will be chief justice @entity232 ' lesbian cousin who lives in @entity3			2
but , frankly , whatever the high court decides is n't all that important anymore			0
because , closer to home , many @entity3 have already admitted their mistake			0
and soon , they 'll be looking for a way to correct it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239			0

@entity239 : @entity3 voted in 2008 to ban same - sex marriage
*proposition* 8 *backers* used fear to make their case against it , he says
many @entity101 have shifted , seeing that their friends , loved ones include gays
@entity239 : today @entity3 would vote in favor of same - sex marriage
