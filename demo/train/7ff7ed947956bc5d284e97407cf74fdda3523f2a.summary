the death of an @entity3 prosecutor who accused the country 's most powerful of a criminal cover - up has put on display a labyrinth that could have hatched from a novelist 's imagination			1
it involves an investigation into the deadliest terror attack in @entity3 's history , modern geopolitics , alleged betrayals , a puzzling death and a dose of paranoia			1
if you are unfamiliar with the story : last week , a special prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of a @entity23 in @entity24 filed a report alleging that the president , foreign minister and other officials conspired to cover up @entity30 's involvement in the attack , which killed 85			1
the prosecutor , @entity32 , was invited to testify about his allegations before @entity34 on monday			1
but on the eve of his testimony , @entity32 was found dead inside his apartment			2
he died of a gunshot wound to the temple			0
a gun and a shell casing were found near his body			0
the apartment was locked from the inside			0
at first glance , a suicide			2
but the untimely death raised suspicions immediately			0
a poll by the firm @entity50 of more than 400 @entity3 found that 70 % of them believed that @entity32 was murdered			1
some 18 % believed he took his own life , and 12 % did n't have an opinion			0
president @entity54 , who initially called @entity32 's death a suicide , reversed her thinking thursday			1
in a statement , she called it " the suicide ( that i am convinced ) was not a suicide			0
" it is an about - face from her position just days before			0
her first statement on @entity32 's death was a rejection of the prosecutor 's allegations and a reflection on , " what was it that led a person to make the terrible decision to take his own life ? " two things happened after that : the prosecutor looking into @entity32 's death said that no gunpowder residue was found on his hands , as would be likely if he pulled the trigger			1
second , the locksmith who helped @entity32 's mother gain access into the apartment cast doubt on reports that the door could have been opened only from inside			1
to the contrary , someone could have gained entry with something as simple as a wire , the locksmith said			0
" anybody could have opened it , " he told a swarm of reporters after giving a statement to investigators			0
while @entity95 now considers that @entity32 did not commit suicide , she still believes that his allegations against her government are false			1
@entity32 was not a hack with an agenda against the president , but a naive investigator who was used by others who fed him false information , @entity95 said			1
" the criminal complaint by prosecutor @entity32 was never in itself the true plot against the government , " @entity95 wrote			2
his report " collapses like a house of cards , " she wrote , and @entity32 probably never knew he was being fed false information			2
the real plot against the government was his death , which came after he accused her government of a cover - up to protect @entity30 suspects in the bombing , @entity95 wrote			0
" they used him while he was alive , and then they needed him dead , " she wrote			0
" it 's that sad and terrible			0
" @entity32 's report promised to provide evidence " of the existence of a sophisticated criminal plot , deliberately conjured to cover up and provide impunity to the @entity30 accused in the investigation of the attack " of the @entity23 in 1994			1
less than 48 hours after @entity32 's body was found , the court that had received the criminal complaint published the entire document on the internet			1
traffic was so heavy that the website hosting the document crashed for a while			0
the 289 - page report makes its case based on tapped telephone conversations between representatives of @entity3 and @entity30 and concludes that the @entity141 nation agreed to stop pursuing the named @entity30 suspects in the bombing in exchange for an oil - for - grain - and - meat deal with @entity30			2
a little background : in 2007 , @entity3 requested the arrest of several @entity30 in connection with the 1994 bombing , including former defense minister @entity150			2
@entity151 approved so - called @entity152 for these suspects , alerting countries around the world of @entity24 ' desire to have them arrested			0
according to @entity32 's report , representatives on @entity95 's behalf held both secret and public meetings where it was agreed that the trade deal could be reached if the @entity152 were withdrawn			1
it was a geopolitical move to fortify @entity3 's economic position at the cost of forgoing justice in the bombing of the @entity170 building , according to @entity32			1
intercepted phone calls between representatives of both countries show that there was a conspiracy to create a new hypothesis for the bombing and to redirect the investigation based on fake evidence that would remove the spotlight from the @entity30 , @entity32 's report states			1
the public face of this plan was an agreement reached between both countries in 2013 to jointly investigate the bombing by creating a binational " truth commission , " @entity32 wrote			2
the plan never took off , however , because of an unexpected roadblock , according to @entity32 's report			1
@entity151 refused to withdraw the @entity152 against the @entity30			0
without that , @entity30 moved the deal to the back burner , @entity32 wrote			2
the release of @entity32 's report was not a bombshell			1
its contents were widely reported , but @entity95 's government and its supporters outright rejected the allegations			0
@entity95 focused her attack on @entity32 's sources , including two @entity3 that the prosecutor identified as working for the country 's intelligence services			1
these alleged spies -- @entity207 and @entity208 -- never worked for @entity3 intelligence , @entity95 said			2
everything @entity32 argues is false , @entity95 says -- the spies were spies , @entity3 did n't ask @entity151 to withdraw the @entity152 , trade between @entity3 and @entity30 has actually decreased , and so on			1
" we think all the allegations are baseless , " foreign minister @entity212 told @entity0 on thursday			0
@entity95 's government has done more than any previous administration to get to the bottom of the bombing , @entity212 said			0
" i am @entity23 , " he said			0
" and to think that a person of my religion , the @entity23 religion , can make a deal not to prosecute the death of 85 people , most of them @entity23 in @entity3 ... i have to tell you , it 's not easy to live with			1
" the @entity3 government was not involved in @entity32 's death in any way , he said			1
" nobody , i mean , wanted more for mr. @entity32 to live and to answer questions , than the president of @entity3 and myself , " @entity212 said			1
if the accusations and counter-accusations laid out by all sides are n't confusing enough , additional theories continue to arise			0
in a news conference , @entity3 's chief of the cabinet ministers , @entity95 , offered new questions			1
@entity32 was on vacation in @entity242 with his teenage daughter when he suddenly cut short his trip and returned to @entity3 , according to the cabinet chief			1
" things just get stranger , " he said , asking who called him back in a hurry			0
" why did he return ? why did he leave his daughter there , alone at an international airport ? " the cabinet chief said			0
it was previously reported in the local media that @entity32 told a reporter at least twice that this investigation might cost him his life			2
he also allegedly got the handgun from a friend because he feared for his security , according to reports			0
the cabinet chief proposed another wrinkle : " the closer we read ( the report ) , the more we are convinced that @entity32 did n't even write that complaint			2
what is the reason behind filing this ? what is the objective ? this is what we must find out			0
" the whole story is a tangled web that is hard to describe , but reflects an observation @entity3 novelist @entity276 once made : " reality is not always probable , or likely			2
" @entity0 's @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report .			0
