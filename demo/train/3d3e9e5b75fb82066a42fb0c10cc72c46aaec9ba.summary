as education scandals go , the news that students at some of the best high schools on @entity4 paid others to take their @entity7 tests seems mild			1
the @entity4 scandal pales behind the sex scandal at @entity11			1
yet the fears driving the @entity4 scandal come with much broader educational implications than those affecting @entity11			2
the cheating scandal reflects the tyranny that standardized testing has come to exercise over higher education in @entity19			1
just before @entity22 , @entity21 district attorney @entity20 leveled criminal charges against 13 students for their part in the @entity4 testing scandal			1
@entity27 was right to treat as a criminal matter the testing fraud , which , after seven arrests in september , now includes 20 @entity4 students			1
two more suspects turn themselves in but if colleges and high schools sit back and regard the @entity4 scandal as primarily a security issue to be corrected by better policing , they are failing in their mission			1
they bear a huge responsibility for the degree to which a high score on a standardized test has become disproportionately important for college admission			1
the @entity4 testing scandal reflects the extent to which high school students across the country are responding to what their teachers and colleges are telling them will bring success			1
they are acting on the premise that in the race to gain admission to the nation 's most prestigious schools , getting a high score on the @entity58 or @entity7 tests is the equivalent of winning the lottery			2
this obsessive focus is exactly the opposite of the generous ideal that in 1934 led @entity66 president @entity65 to pioneer the use of the sat , @entity68 , for admission to @entity66			2
@entity65 's aim was to find worthy students in schools across the country who were not part of the elite private school system from which @entity66 traditionally drew most of its students			0
today , @entity65 's approach to the sat is an anachronism			0
as @entity81 and @entity82 show in their study of race and class in college admissions , " @entity95 , not yet @entity96 , " selective colleges give blacks a 310 - point bonus and @entity89 a 130 - point bonus on the sat test in order to achieve a measure of diversity			1
but that practice has not changed colleges ' overall reliance on the @entity68 test as a guide to admissions			2
colleges vie with one another to get the highest testers they can find , and the prestigious @entity107 and @entity108 ranking of colleges and universities makes admissions test scores a key factor in its influential rating system			1
the question colleges and universities need to ask themselves is what can they do to lessen the educational testing equivalent of the old nuclear arms race			0
the short answer is treat standardized tests , which all too often correlate with income , with greater skepticism			0
the long answer is for colleges to balance their use of the tests with a more complex look at their applicants than is now common practice			1
i teach at a college that has completely dropped requiring @entity58 and sat tests for admissions			2
we found the tests revealed more about students ' racial and economic backgrounds than abilities , but i am aware that such a radical departure from the norm is out of the question for most schools -- especially the flagship state universities that are swamped with thousands upon thousands of applications			0
what is , however , possible for all colleges to do is reduce the weight they give the @entity58 and sat tests and thereby reduce students ' obsession with their test scores			1
there are a number of ways to bring about this change , but two stand out as the most practical			0
the first step is for colleges to increase the size of their admissions staffs so the staffs can look more closely at prospective students ' writing samples , grades and references			0
colleges speak about considering the overall potential of a student , but that is an empty claim when overworked admissions officers are struggling just to keep up with the paperwork they face			0
for a second step , every college that can afford it should make a commitment to interview as many of its strong applicants as possible			0
this may mean paying for a campus visit by a future scholarship student or sending admissions staffers on trips across the country , but the effort is worth it			0
an interview , if conducted skillfully , is difficult to fake			0
it gives individual students the chance to explain who they are free from coaching by parents or paid college advisers			0
such measures do n't guarantee that we will be able to avoid future testing scandals , but their promise is superior to relying solely on the better - policing strategy -- epitomized by the october decision of the @entity7 , which administers the sat test , to hire the firm headed by @entity203 , the former head of the @entity204 , to investigate its security measures			2
by expanding the window through which they view applicants , colleges and universities can reduce the incentives anxious students and their parents currently have to game the system			2
they can even make the whole student the person they pursue .			0
