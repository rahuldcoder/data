the remains , which had been interred in numbered graves by @entity2 , began arriving in the @entity14 and @entity15 early thursday , the @entity11 - controlled @entity10 news agency reported			1
the remains of 79 @entity6 were delivered to the seat of the @entity11 government in @entity18 , @entity14 , where @entity11 president @entity19 presided over an official military ceremony			1
the 79 caskets , wrapped with the @entity11 flag , were carried by the @entity11 presidential guard into the main square of the presidential compound			1
@entity19 , family members of those killed and other honorees stood by as 21 - gun salutes were fired			0
@entity19 laid a wreath on the caskets , and a formal prayer was given by the former mufti of @entity34 , sheikh @entity33			0
the ceremony was broadcast on @entity11 television			1
the remaining 12 bodies were to be delivered to families in @entity15			0
among the returned will be the remains of seven @entity6 involved in a 1975 attack against the @entity41 hotel in @entity42			0
those remains , along with some that are unidentified , will be buried in the @entity18 military cemetery			0
some families were demanding dna testing to verify the identities of the remains			0
the return of the remains was meant as a " confidence - building measure to help get the peace process back on track			1
" said @entity56 , an @entity2 government spokesman			1
" @entity2 is ready for the immediate resumption of peace talks without any preconditions whatsoever , " he said in a statement			1
the return was harshly criticized by some in @entity2 , who compared it to last year 's exchange of hundreds of @entity11 prisoners for the release of @entity2 soldier @entity69			1
@entity70 and other @entity11 militant groups on the @entity15 border captured @entity69 in 2006			1
@entity73 , chairman of @entity74 , the @entity2 association of terror victims , told @entity0 that releasing the remains would only serve " for the continuation ( of ) terror			1
" " beyond our personal feelings , it is devastating to see the hard murderers that were released last year under the @entity69 deal becoming a building block in the @entity11 campaign of propaganda and ( being ) glorified as freedom fighters , " @entity73 said			1
" the @entity11 society must show disapproval of their actions			2
this is another stage in the making of terrorist theology			0
" most @entity2 consider the remains to be those of terrorists , but many @entity6 view the men as martyrs in the decades - old struggle to establish a @entity11 state			1
@entity102 of the @entity103 and @entity104 , which helps @entity11 family members find missing relatives , called it " a very special and historic moment			2

" it is a success , but that is not the end of the story , " @entity112 said			0
" there are stories that are still being unraveled			0
" @entity119 , a member of the @entity121 's central committee and a senior @entity11 negotiator , noted in comments to @entity0 that although 91 sets of remains were received , " we did not receive all of them , and it is with great bitterness that we received their remains			2
" he said many @entity6 were hoping prisoners still alive in @entity2 jails would also be released			2
" to keep human bodies in cemeteries ... in graves that ( have ) no names , " only numbers , he said , " just shows how ugly the @entity2 occupation is			2
" @entity140 was shocked and surprised to learn the remains of his brother @entity142 were being returned by @entity2			2
for 23 years , the family has not known what happened to him			0
" all these years , we believed he was missing , " @entity140 said			0
" we have consulted every human rights organization , but to no avail			0
" he said his family asked the @entity2 government about his brother in the past , but was told no information was available			2
he said his family is still seeking information and will examine the body and conduct dna testing on the remains			0
