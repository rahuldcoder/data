almost everyone , from educators to government officials to industry experts , laments the lackluster abilities and performance of our nations ' students in science , technology , engineering and math ( know as @entity14 education )			1
two indicators are particularly worrisome , especially as this country experiences greater global competition and high unemployment			0
@entity20 students score 23rd in math and 31st in science when compared with 65 other top industrial countries			1
in math , we are beaten by countries from @entity27 and @entity28 to the @entity29 and @entity30			2
in science , we are beaten by countries from @entity33 and @entity34 to @entity35 and @entity36			2
for the @entity20 , which led the way in space after @entity40 and showed the way in technological development and economic growth for the last 40 years , this is more than an embarrassment			1
and , for the future of our own gdp , economic well - being , and employer and employment needs , this is a disaster in the making			0
if the @entity20 wishes to remain the most competitive and innovative country in the world -- never mind just another competitive and innovative country in the constellation of industrial nations -- this can not stand			1
as a report released this week from the @entity64 found , " economic forecasts point to a need for producing , over the next decade , approximately 1 million more college graduates in @entity14 fields than expected under current assumptions			1
" already , for many , the answer is to import the technological know - how that we need			0
there is nothing wrong with importing high - skilled labor and expanding visas and citizenship quotas for those needs we ca n't meet ourselves , but should we not be able to do a better job in growing and training our own citizens and students first ? president @entity78 brought attention to the problem this week while hosting the second annual @entity81			1
featuring more than 100 middle school and high school students with their various inventions , the president talked not just about the economic reasons important to our success in @entity14 education but also our historic — indeed , founding — commitment to it : " [ @entity92 ] he belief that we belong on the cutting edge of innovation , that 's an idea as old as @entity20 itself			1
... you think about our @entity99 -- they were all out there doing experiments -- and folks like @entity103 and @entity104 , they were constantly curious about the world around them and trying to figure out how can we help shape that environment so that people 's lives are better			0
" it 's in our dna			0
" to tell students already engaged in experimentation , innovation and invention that scientific knowledge is in our dna is more than appropriate			0
but for too many students , it simply is not true today			0
indeed , when it comes to math and science , we do n't just fail compared to other industrialized nations , we fail ourselves			1
only 26 % of our nation 's high school seniors perform at proficient levels or above in mathematics and only 21 % of our nation 's high school seniors perform at proficient levels or above in science			0
and , when these students do enter college on a pathway toward a degree in science or engineering , nearly 40 % of them switch majors in what one expert has called " the math - science death march			1
" to improve these numbers , and to become a nation strong in innovation again , will require a lot of work , but it is work that is doable			0
here 's how : @entity149 - load @entity14 - related teaching			1
tap into children 's natural curiosity and teach it earlier in school , and recognize subjects like math and science are as important as @entity158			1
one recent story out of @entity160 showed the benefit to students in learning math as early as preschool , where the lessons are integrated into " story time , puzzle time , just about any time of the day			2
" ii. recognize that teachers , especially in the early grades , need training in math so they can integrate it as much as possible into children 's school life and curriculum			1
@entity177 do not segregate math and science classes from the rest of the school building or coursework			2
turn away from the notion of specialized elementary and secondary schools whose focus is on math and science			2
these areas of study should be in all schools and deemed a critical part of each and every school 's broad curriculum			0
students who excel in these areas should not be seen as " different " or libeled as " special " or worse			0
@entity197 and every class taught , where possible and relevant , should adopt forms of mathematical and scientific methods in its pedagogy , engage in practices of " building models , arguing from evidence and communicating findings " so as to " increase the likelihood that students will learns the ideas of science or engineering and mathematics at a deeper , more enduring level , " as two @entity14 scholars recently suggested			1
@entity217 districts and principals should avail themselves of nonprofit organizations that are dedicated to supplemental training of teachers in @entity14 areas			1
most good teachers want additional training			2
and most adults cheer when students light up in these areas after they are inspired by a great teacher			0
many of us have seen the @entity232 commercial that shows an eighth grade student , @entity233 , building a robot and calling science " cool , " with the help of @entity237 ( to which i 'm a senior adviser )			0
enterprising organizations such as @entity237 host additional training for teachers			2
students who take courses from these teachers are more interested and dedicated to their coursework than those who are not			2
with teachers who can show the relevance and fun of @entity14 education , we can nurture more students to build the kind of experiments and models one sees at events such as the @entity81			1
we now know from study after study the value of great teachers			0
quite simply , the effect of a quality teacher on a child 's life is monumental			0
corporations should further endow nonprofits dedicated to enhancing teachers ' abilities , and school districts and principals should further utilize these auxiliary institutions			0
in the end , the test of whether we should do better at teaching @entity14 education does not require an analysis of what our leaders of industries say they are looking for or what international tests show as our failings			1
it is simply this : ask any adult not employed in a @entity14 area of work : " do n't you wish you studied and appreciated math and science courses earlier in school ? " the answer almost always is going to be : " yes			1
" and so , too , should it be for students now ... not adults later			0

reports show @entity20 is *losing* its competitive edge in math , engineering , science , technology
@entity304 : we must do a better job in training our citizens and students in @entity14 fields
@entity304 offers 5 ways in which we can improve national math and science education
he says that if @entity20 wants to stay on top , it has to do more to help students and teachers
