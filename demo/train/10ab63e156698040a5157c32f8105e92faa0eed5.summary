-- president @entity1 on wednesday will visit @entity2 , @entity3 , one of the cities hardest hit with foreclosures , where he 's expected to outline a $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion plan to help homeowners			1
economist @entity9 said $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion wo n't be enough to solve the mortgage crisis			1
though administration officials are tight - lipped about details , one idea that has been floated is for the federal government to reduce monthly mortgage payments by modifying loans			1
@entity17 , the @entity19 @entity18 chairwoman , has advocated reducing payments to between 31 and 38 percent of a family 's gross income			1
" this crisis in housing has devastating consequences , and our government should have moved more forcefully to help contain the damage , " treasury secretary @entity23 said monday			1
" you 're going to learn about [ the administration 's plan ] as the rollout continues , " said @entity30 , vice president @entity32 's economic advisor			1
@entity30 said it will be a " very aggressive plan to help responsible homeowners stay in their homes			2
" in @entity2 , the median home price is $ 150,000 -- a significant dip from its peak of $ 262,000 in recent years			2
the national rate of foreclosure increased by 79 percent between december 2006 and december 2007 , according to @entity45 , a company that compiles data on home foreclosures			0
foreclosure filings -- default notices , auction sale notices and bank repossessions -- continued to climb in january , though at a slower pace than the month before , according to @entity45			0
that was still 18 percent higher than in january 2008			0
" it 's really a toxic mix of higher than anticipated prices on monthly payments combined with house values that have dropped makes it impossible for people to refinance or sell their homes , " said @entity45 vice president @entity54			1
some economists praise federal intervention in the housing crisis			1
" you cut down on the ratio to make [ home ownership ] more affordable , " said @entity66 , a professor of finance and real estate at @entity69			0
but @entity66 cautioned that the president 's plan will likely only make a dent in the problem			2
" fifty billion is a good place to start but i 'm just saying right now it 's not enough , " he said			2
" it 'll be enough to save @entity80 where they really do n't have big negative equity problems			0
" economist @entity9 , of the @entity83 , agrees with @entity66			0
" we are likely looking at a trillion dollars in mortgage losses before it 's all over , " he said			2
" and putting $ 50 [ billion ] to $ 100 billion in is not going to solve the problem			1
" today is a game of payback for yesterday , said @entity90 , a foreclosure attorney who has been quite busy lately			0
" we lived in a culture the last 10 years where mortgage originators said you could use your house as a credit card to pay off your cars , to pay off your credit card bills , " he said			0
" well , that does n't exist anymore			0
" @entity0 's @entity100 and @entity101 contributed to this report .			0
