@entity0 , @entity1 -- like many @entity1 guides , @entity3 started trekking to the top of @entity6 in the shadow of more famous climbers -- including the son of the late sir @entity10 , the first person to climb to the top of the world 's tallest peak			1
@entity3 has climbed @entity6 more times than any other person			1
but the 49 - year - old @entity1 -- who now lives in the @entity17 -- on thursday morning became the only person in the world to summit @entity6 19 times			1
@entity3 says his goals in climbing the 29,029 - foot ( 8,848 - meter ) mountain have nothing to do with setting the world record for @entity6 summits , a title he has held since 1998			1
" up to the 17th time in 2007 i climbed as a professional , as part of my occupation , " @entity3 said , according to the web site tracking the progress of his most recent expedition			2
" but last year i climbed to raise funds for a school in @entity38 , my village on the foot of @entity6			1
" in addition to raising money for @entity1 schoolkids , @entity3 also plans to remove more than two tons of garbage from @entity6			1
over the past 55 years , some 2,000 mountaineers have climbed the peak , leaving behind a trail of trash that includes oxygen bottles , food cans , gas cylinders , paper , plastic and even tents			0
@entity6 -- known by @entity54 as @entity6 -- is considered sacred by the @entity1 people , and is worshipped as a goddess of wealth and power by the @entity59 , the inhabitants of the @entity6 region			1
@entity3 comes from the famed sherpa community of mountain guides , who work as porters and climbing guides for mountaineers from all over the world			1
while @entity6 is not considered the most technically challenging climb by experienced mountaineers , the world 's highest peak attracts an array of climbers who spend tens of thousands of dollars for the chance to make it to the top			2
however , the mountain is deadly for many climbers : more than 200 people have died trying to scale @entity6			1
@entity3 began working as an expedition porter for @entity6 climbers to earn money after his father died when he was 12 years old , according to his biography on his team 's web site , @entity89			1
many of the mountaineers noticed the young sherpa who , despite his small size , was able to carry large loads " with strength , quickness and a wide smile , " according to his biography			0
but it was n't until he was about 30 years old that @entity3 began climbing @entity6 as a guide			1
he made it to the top in 1990 with a team that included @entity104 , whose father first summited the peak along @entity107 in 1953			0
that team also included @entity108 , a @entity109 who lost his life on the mountain in 1996 , the deadliest season for climbers in @entity6 's history			2
eight climbers , including @entity108 , died trying to summit the peak on may 11 , 1996 , known as the " @entity6 disaster			2
" the incident highlighted the pressure that mountaineering companies face when their clients -- who have paid as much as $ 60,000 -- want to make it to the top despite foreboding weather and their lack of experience			0
@entity108 had asked @entity3 several times during the 1996 season to work for him , but @entity3 refused in order to be with his family , according to @entity131			2
@entity3 reached @entity6 's peak for the 19th time at 8 a.m. local time on thursday , announcing over a crackling radio , " i am at the top and looking at all the prayer flags , " according to the web site tracking his progress			1
" i have just satisfied the deities and placed the @entity141 on the summit			0
" he was referring to an 8 - inch - tall copper vase which is considered sacred and contains 400 elements , including precious metals , @entity147 relics , shreds of robes worn by venerated monks , holy water , and soil			0
last month , @entity3 said that putting the vase on the mountain would be a prayer for world peace and prosperity			2
after spending 30 minutes at the top , he headed down			0
" it is so cold here ... i am heading down			0
" crowds of climbers forced @entity3 to delay his ascent to the summit by an hour			0
may is considered the ideal time to try to reach the top of @entity6 , and @entity1 tourism authorities said 98 people had climbed the mountain on tuesday and wednesday from the south side			1
@entity3 currently lives near @entity170 , @entity171 , where he works as a climbing instructor and gives lectures			0
he has three children -- two sons , ages 23 and 18 , and a 14 - year - old daughter			0
he has said he does not want his children to follow in his footsteps as a climber			0
his @entity182 team has raised $ 30,000 to educate the children of @entity1 , and @entity3 hopes that his climbing successes will continue to raise more money for the impoverished @entity187 country			1
" i never had a plan to make a record , " @entity3 told the @entity188 last month before leaving for @entity1			2
" i never had that as a dream			0
" @entity2 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 says he climbs to raise money for his village , at the foot of the mountain
more than 200 people have died trying to scale @entity6
