-- it might not be the biggest blunder in " @entity4 " history , but it just might be podium worthy			2
recently a contestant named @entity7 rang in first during one of the @entity9 , where one by one , letters are revealed until a contestant buzzes in and takes a guess			2
" s -- @entity15 -- @entity16			0
" @entity7 's guess was " @entity18			0
" where ? go ? really ? to which host @entity20 said , bluntly , " uh , no , " while probably thinking , " what the bleep is surf clay ? " we 're guessing @entity7 is not a fan of @entity26 and not familiar with the classic " @entity28 , @entity29			1
" @entity30 tracked down @entity7 , last name @entity32 , who told the website that in his rush to buzz in he panicked and forgot the category			1
as @entity32 pointed out , it 's not like he flubbed three puzzles like a student did in april during a college week episode			0
that man , @entity41 , even blew one round in which every letter could be seen			0
he mispronounced achilles , to the benefit of the next contestant			0
@entity47 told @entity30 he was going to take the $ 7,200 he won and use part of it to go on a cruise			1
we hope they do n't run into any surf clay			1
' @entity4 ' contestant has epic win			2

" @entity4 " contestant @entity32 should have *waited* a few more letters
he tells @entity30 he forgot the category , which was song *lyrics*
we 're still trying to figure out what surf clay is
he still won $ 7,200 and will go on a cruise
