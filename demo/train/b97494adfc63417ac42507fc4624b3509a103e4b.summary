editor 's note : @entity2 , @entity3 , is chief medical officer at @entity4 , a national nonprofit organization that has been treating addiction for 60 years			1
he is co-author of two @entity4 books : " when painkillers become dangerous " and " @entity9 : a guide for @entity11 in @entity12			1
" @entity2 says opioid painkillers are highly addictive and in the same class of drugs as heroin			1
@entity17 , @entity18 ( @entity19 ) -- prescribed opioids -- pain medication -- have become the fastest - growing addiction problem in the @entity23			1
they are second to marijuana as the most commonly used illicit substances			2
@entity27 and @entity28 lead the way among our youth ; the 2008 " monitoring the @entity33 " by the @entity34 found that 9.7 percent of high school seniors have misused @entity27 and 4.7 percent @entity28			2
there is a na√Øve consensus that these are safe medications because they are prescribed by physicians			2
however , they are extremely reinforcing , highly addictive and in the same class of drugs as heroin			1
opioid prescriptions have skyrocketed since the mid ' 90s and with this we have seen dramatic increases in illicit diversion of the drugs , addiction treatment admissions , emergency room visits for opioid overdoses and deaths			1
historically , pain has been inadequately treated by physicians , so there is good reason for the increased medical use of opioid pain medications			2
however , inadequate safeguards are in place and no one was prepared for the dramatic increase in addiction to these medications			1
some have argued that the addiction - related problems are a small price to pay for the relief of pain for the masses , but the parents of a 17 - year - old girl who died of an @entity28 overdose in @entity73 , @entity74 , last year would most certainly disagree			1
most often people obtain these medications by prescription ; usually by " doctor shopping " -- going to multiple doctors for prescriptions			1
they are also purchased at " pill mills " from unscrupulous physicians , from dealers and on the @entity84			2
young people often obtain them from their parents ' and grandparents ' medicine cabinets			1
they are very easy to obtain			2
heroin is actually cheaper than these medications , resulting in another problem ; once addicted , requiring high doses of opioids due to rapid buildup of tolerance , people look for less expensive alternatives			1
heroin use rapidly escalates , increasing the potential for iv use and the associated risk of hepatitis c , @entity104 and other infections			1
i worked with a 23 - year - old who , as a senior in high school , used @entity27 that was legitimately obtained due to a football injury			2
he and four friends were experimenting with other drugs and overused it			0
they all started to obtain opioids from physicians because of various real and fake injuries			0
over time they became opioid addicts and three of them moved on to heroin			1
none of them went on to college and they were all caught in the vicious cycle of opioid addiction ; using high doses every few hours , engaging in crime to support their addiction			1
this is not a problem limited to our youth			0
the " boomers " are aging and developing aches and pains			0
pain is the most common problem bringing people to the doctor , and opioid pain medications are frequently prescribed for even minor pain			1
it 's quick and easy for the physician to write a prescription for these medications and move on to the next patient			1
the patient is satisfied and the pain is often relieved			0
unfortunately , some of these prescriptions will go to those already addicted and some will initiate an addictive cycle			0
a 54 - year - old woman came to see me for detoxification from opioids			0
she had obtained five prescriptions per month from five physicians			0
none were aware of her problem , nor suspected addiction			1
she was never seeking more , never tried to fill prescriptions early and appeared to be using them as prescribed			0
her husband had divorced her , she could not work and her home was going into foreclosure			0
she was caring for her two teenagers , but was barely able to care for herself			0
these stories and many , many more illustrate our need for a national response to this crisis			0
if any other " legitimate " illness was killing hundreds of thousands of people per year , we would have outrage , government intervention and establish a directed response			1
unfortunately , this is a disease of great stigma , and easy to neglect			0
we must begin to address this issue			0
how can we do so ? @entity34 , the @entity34 , and the @entity185 , the @entity185 , should establish a task force to examine and implement a national response			0
a state or national computerized pharmacy record should be maintained and examined for overuse of prescribed medications			0
law enforcement needs new laws , and resources to effectively shut down " pill mills , " internet prescribers and unscrupulous physicians			0
state medical boards need to examine over-prescribing and strip some physicians of their license to practice medicine , as well as offer training about addiction and appropriate prescribing of pain medications			1
most states , especially in this economy , are in dire need of increased resources for addiction treatment			1
effective treatments for opioid addiction exist			2
we need to provide training for medical students , nursing students , psychologists and social workers in the identification , evaluation and treatment of addiction as well as identifying drug - seeking behavior			2
we barely provide any training to our health care professionals about addiction in spite of the fact that 25 percent of the national health care budget goes to addiction - related illness			2
chronic pain is commonly treated with opioids , but alternatives exist and in many cases are better			1
among the alternatives are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen , physical therapy , massage , acupuncture , nonaddicting pain mediations and exercise			2
cognitive behavioral therapies can also be very effective for chronic pain			0
insurance companies need to fund the alternative treatments			0
our physicians , other prescribers and caregivers need to pay more attention to the risks associated with prescribing these medications			0
appropriate prescribing , ongoing monitoring and educating patients about the risks are essential to good practice			0
addiction is an equal opportunity disease			2
it does n't care about your age , race , gender and socioeconomic status -- which is why nearly 24 million @entity23 are dependent on -- or abuse -- alcohol or other drugs			1
treatment works and there is hope for lifelong recovery			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity276 .			0
