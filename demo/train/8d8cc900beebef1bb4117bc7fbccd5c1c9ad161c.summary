-- a copyright dispute over royalties from an acclaimed film , " @entity4 , " can go the distance after the @entity6 on monday allowed a lawsuit to move ahead			1
the appeal deals with a 1963 book and screenplay on the life of former middleweight boxing champion @entity12 , who wrote it with his childhood friend and business partner , @entity15			1
@entity12 's story was made into the 1980 movie , starring @entity18			2
the justices , by a 6 - 3 vote , concluded @entity15 's daughter did not wait too long to make her claims against @entity23 , which made and distributed the @entity25 - winning drama			1
the case on the merits will now be heard in lower federal courts			2
entertainment companies will likely be affected financially by the ruling			1
earlier courts had limited similar lawsuits , often filed many years after movies , plays , and television shows first premiered , by the estates of actors , writers , and producers			1
with new electronic outlets emerging for a range of entertainment and literary properties , those companies may have to rethink their strategy when negotiating not only rights to the original creative property , but such retooled content as merchandising , spinoffs , and video games			1
the underlying issue was a lot more dry and technical than the film itself : equitable defense and tolling for remedies in civil copyright claims			2
that was apparently enough to temper the court 's creative streak in justice @entity63 's majority opinion -- no pop culture references to showbiz or sports ; no clever rhetoric about this being a " knockout " legal fight ; and no justice who would admit ever seeing the acclaimed film			2
at issue is whether rolling time limits in filing copyright infringement lawsuits applied in this case			2
she claimed ownership over the original screenplay and the subsequent rights to the story			1
her father died a year after the movie 's release			0
federal copyright law gave @entity85 the sole right to renew the copyrights before the term expired , which she did in 1991			0
but her lawsuit was not filed until 2009			1
@entity23 and @entity90 -- the movie 's distributor -- say that violates the established legal principle of " laches , " which bars most claims that are unreasonably delayed , on the theory it would unfairly burden the adverse party			2
both sides also dispute what ownership rights the studio retained after the elder @entity15 's death , and which were subsequently returned to his daughter			1
@entity85 claims she is the sole owner of the book and the original screenplay , and that the subsequent film infringes on those copyrights			1
she seeks damages dating back three years from the filing of the lawsuit , and an injunction on further distribution of the work without compensation			1
her lawyers claim the delay over years was caused by fear of retaliation , lack of money to file the suit , and being told by the studio that " @entity4 " was no longer making money			2
the federal government backed her , at least in part			0
@entity23 and @entity90 say they have invested heavily to convert the film to formats such as @entity128 for home viewing , and for overseas distribution			0
the companies say having an open - ended period to file copyright claims makes it hard to make future business decisions			1
but @entity63 , writing for the court , concluded the studio had the weaker argument			0
" if the rule were , as @entity23 urges , ' sue soon , or forever hold your peace , ' copyright owners would have to mount a federal case fast to stop seemingly innocuous infringements , lest those infringements eventually grow in magnitude , " she said			0
the three - year limitations period " allows a copyright owner to defer suit until she can estimate whether litigation is worth the candle			0
she will miss out on damages for periods prior to the three - year look - back , but her right to prospective injunctive relief should , in most cases , remain unaltered			0
" @entity63 added , " allowing @entity15 's suit to go forward will put at risk only a fraction of the income @entity23 has earned during that period and will work no unjust hardship on innocent third parties , such as consumers who have purchased copies of ' @entity4			0
' " justices @entity167 and @entity169 , along with chief justice @entity170 dissented			2
copyright experts say the high court 's ruling will make it easier to press decades - old copyright claims			1
" @entity178 has an insatiable appetite for recycling old film content , " said @entity176 , an attorney with @entity177			0
" increasingly copyright ownership for much of this older content has now been passed down to the families and heirs of the original creators			1
and if the current owners did not sign over all their copyrights to the industry , you end up with potentially multi-billion dollar clashes of interest			0
" " @entity4 " won two @entity25 , including best actor for @entity18 , who portrayed the boxer			0
@entity12 is 92 and not a party in the appeal			0
the fighter also known as the " @entity12 " held the middleweight title from 1949 - 51			0
the case is @entity199 ( 12 - 1315 ) .			0

the @entity6 permits lawsuit to move ahead years after being filed
the justices say daughter of book *co-author* did *n't* wait too long to make her claims
she claimed ownership of the original screenplay and subsequent rights
entertainment companies are likely to be impacted by the ruling
