@entity0 -- federal agents watched in horror as an unknown male in an internet photo appealed for stomach - churning advice -- how to rape the child beside him			1
the girl was in pajamas and the man appeared intent on abusing her sometime soon			1
homeland security agents knew they were in a race against time to save the girl			1
in a narrow , windowless office outside @entity0 , special agent @entity14 sits at a bank of computer screens			2
the room is modest but the technology @entity14 is using is second to none			0
he showed @entity1 's @entity21 how @entity23 agents chase down child pornographers			1
the tone in his voice changes when he begins to tell us about the 11 - year - old girl and the special case , which the agency has termed " @entity32			1
" " this @entity32 series [ of photos ] was being posted by an individual who was looking for information on how best to rape this little girl and get away with it			1
" @entity14 , who has daughters of his own , says he began scanning the photos being posted online for any clues that might give away their location			0
and he knew , he did n't have much time			0
" the advice he was getting online ranged from drugging her to brutally attacking her , " says @entity14			0
" it was progressing so we were extremely concerned for her welfare			0
" the agent noticed a blurry highway road sign in the window			0
it was his first , and best , clue			1
he and his colleagues set to work			2
the road sign looked like a sunflower logo -- a clue that led agents to @entity61 where the sunflower is the state flower			1
and the first number on the sign was surely a 2			0
but the other numbers were too blurred to be sure which road it was			0
" we began looking at the road sign			0
it really looked to most of us like a highway 203 , and there was a highway 203 in @entity61 , [ but ] when we got there , got off the plane the agent from @entity61 said " it 's not 203 , we just drove the whole highway , the sign 's not there			0
" " so @entity14 and the other agents got back on the road and started driving every highway in @entity61 that starts with a 2			2
" at the very end of the highway where it teed into another highway , we found the sign			2
i jumped out of the vehicle on a very busy highway and almost got hit by a car			0
" knowing the approximate location , @entity14 called the local sheriff 's department , who recognized a backyard swimming pool in another one of the photos			0
they conducted a raid ; arresting the suspect before the exploitation could escalate to the point of rape			0
" when we went in that morning , [ the 11 - year - old girl ] was still wearing those same pajamas as depicted in the images			1
" an @entity106 spokeswoman said the girl is now safe and living with her parents			2
she added the suspect turned out to also be a minor -- 16 years old -- who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to serve 48 months in a juvenile facility			0
former ice director @entity113 , speaking in january , touted the success of this raid and subsequent ones -- named @entity117 after the @entity61 case -- that rescued 123 children , reminded @entity120 that while there was good news to report , the dangers that children face online and elsewhere remain			1
" as satisfying as the arrests in @entity117 have been , today is obviously a day of mixed emotions because this operation is ultimately a tale of the perverse , pervasive and violent exploitation of children - very young children to satisfy the dark pleasures of a group of twisted adults , " said @entity113			1
" sadly , some of the children were very young			2
for example , some of the children we rescued were between the ages of two and three			1
nine children were between the ages of four and six			2
" already in the first six months of 2013 , @entity23 agents have rescued 337 child victims , and they 've taken 964 alleged child predators off the street .			1

federal agents raced against clock trying to save girl in internet image
using high - tech *kit* , they found a single clue , tracked it down and saved the girl
@entity23 use *combination* of computers and old *fashioned* detective work
in 2013 , @entity23 agents rescued 337 children and took 964 alleged predators off the streets
