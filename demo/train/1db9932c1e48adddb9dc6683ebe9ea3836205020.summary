-- normally @entity1 and @entity2 are close partners at the heart of @entity5 -- but @entity7 diplomatic cables suggest a battle royal between the two allies over satellite technology , with the @entity1 space and intelligence agencies accusing the @entity2 of bad faith and looking to the @entity7 as a future partner to develop next - generation satellites			1
at the heart of the rivalry is @entity18 -- a @entity19 -- that would potentially be a leap forward in satellite surveillance			0
a flurry of cables obtained by @entity25 and published by the @entity27 newspaper @entity26 shows @entity1 officials lobbying for a " strategic @entity7 / @entity1 partnership " in 2009 to develop the system , amid @entity2 attempts to kill it			1
some thirty pages of cables show the political maneuvering and enticing technological potential of @entity18 , as well as the determination of the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) to get it deployed by 2013			1
the cables also shows the @entity37 's desperation to end @entity1 's dependence on " foreign sources of imagery			2
" @entity1 officials were clearly sensitive about the dual intelligence and commercial use of the program			0
in february 2009 , @entity7 diplomats were told that " to minimize possible political backlash from developing @entity18 as an intelligence satellite , the program will be managed by a civil agency			2
" but a later cable -- from september 2009 -- talks about @entity18 ' " primary customer " as the @entity1 intelligence service			0
one cable from february 2009 reveals efforts by @entity1 officials to steer development work on @entity18 away from a @entity2 - @entity1 consortium toward a @entity1 company " in an effort to minimize @entity2 mischief			1
" subsequently , a senior official at the @entity1 space agency said @entity1 " had been pushed into a corner by the @entity2 and left little choice but to go it alone within the @entity65			1
" the alliance with the @entity7 , explained another official , would help prevent a @entity2 monopoly of the lucrative market for electro - optical imagery			1
but he was concerned by the " fierce and persistent " @entity2 lobbying to halt @entity18			0
in lobbying the @entity7 embassy in @entity73 , @entity1 officials said @entity18 would enable @entity1 to be " a better partner ... by bringing more unique value to the table			1
" a senior @entity1 official suggested that three @entity1 and three @entity7 satellites could be deployed , with the imagery being shared			2
at the same time , access to @entity7 imagery of @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and the @entity85 ( a terrorist group based on the @entity88 / @entity87 border ) would help fill @entity1 collection gaps			2
@entity7 diplomats were enthusiastic about @entity18 -- saying the @entity1 satellite program " has yielded sophisticated and reliable satellite systems that provide an extraordinary amount of product for their investment			1
" they waxed lyrical about @entity18 ' " daily revisit capability for any spot on the @entity100 's surface , " and its projected ability to provide detailed 3d images			0
@entity1 officials also promised that @entity18 would be able to process " near real - time " or in " milliseconds " data that currently takes several hours to process			0
@entity18 remains in the project phase , despite the intense lobbying by @entity1 space agency and intelligence officials -- and optimistic noises in 2009 that they were ready to move beyond the design phase and start " bending metal			0
" @entity0 has reached out to the @entity1 space agency for further comment on the status and funding of @entity18			0
neither the @entity117 nor the @entity118 would comment on the leaked cables , citing policy not to discuss classified information .			0

cables show *tensions* between @entity2 and @entity1
cables were obtained by @entity25 and published by a @entity27 newspaper
cables indicate @entity1 *wanted* @entity7 partnership for satellite project
