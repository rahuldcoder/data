@entity0 , @entity1 -- a deadline set by @entity1 's new leaders for the surrender of the towns of @entity7 and @entity8 , bastions of hardcore supporters of @entity11 , passed at midnight friday without any apparent deal			1
before the deadline expired , a spokesman for the @entity14 said talks with loyalists were continuing into the evening			2
absent a resolution , " it 's up to military planners to decide how to move forward , " @entity18 @entity17 said			2
sticking points included the demand by @entity16 for @entity14 fighters to enter their communities unarmed , and to refrain from searching houses			0
the loyalists also asked for blanket pardons , but the @entity14 wanted to prosecute loyalists with blood on their hands , @entity17 said			0
@entity7 is on the @entity33 coast east of @entity0 , and @entity8 is southeast of the capital			1
a military spokesman , citing heavy resistance from loyalists in @entity8 , said @entity39 forces had retreated friday			1
@entity14 media committee spokesman @entity40 said fighting for @entity7 was taking place 55 kilometers ( 34 miles ) east of the city			1
@entity44 said @entity14 fighters were met with small - arms fire as they advanced from the east , and a battle ensued with heavy artillery			1
a @entity50 hospital received a number of casualties , he said			0
earlier , @entity53 , an @entity14 chief negotiator , had told @entity2 that @entity39 fighters had been just 1.5 kilometers , nearly a mile , from the center of @entity8 , situated on the north , east and south			1
anti-gadhafi fighters captured seven loyalists , including a brigadier general , he said , and three loyalists were killed			0
an @entity39 fighter was killed and four others were wounded , @entity53 said			0
@entity2 was not able to independently verify his account			0
inside @entity8 , meanwhile , pro- and @entity39 groups clashed , but @entity14 fighters were not involved , said @entity65 , assistant to the commander of @entity68 's southern front			2
@entity17 also said he received intelligence reports that loyalist forces were moving captured @entity14 fighters to @entity72 for use as human shields			2
that town is 10 miles east of @entity7			1
@entity76 , chairman of the @entity14 executive board , will visit @entity68 on saturday to survey the damage in the city , where he has tribal ties , @entity17 said			0
the developments came as @entity82 issued @entity84 arrest warrants friday for @entity11 , who is wanted by the @entity85 in the @entity86 for alleged crimes against humanity			0
a red notice allows @entity82 , the international police agency , to circulate arrest warrants widely with an intention to extradite suspects to the @entity85			0
at the @entity94 , @entity92 , the secretary - general 's special envoy to @entity1 , told reporters that fears of a humanitarian disaster in the capital have not materialized			1
city infrastructure has suffered little damage , the disruption of the water supply has been largely alleviated , supplies of fuel and electricity are improving , schools are slated to reopen september 17 , and there has been no general breakdown of public order , said @entity92 , who had earlier briefed the @entity110 after his return from five days in @entity1			1
" that 's quite a striking conflict with other post-conflict " cities , he said			0
but those advances do not minimize the enormous challenges that transitional authorities still face			0
a @entity119 has been established in @entity0 to bring all armed elements under a single command , but " the proliferation of weapons is a major concern , including to @entity1 's neighbors , " @entity92 said			1
" the approach they 're taking is to , at this stage , tell the very top echelon of the military , the police , the civil service , to remain at home while decisions are taken as to which of them should or should not be part of the future , " he said			0
despite appeals by @entity14 leaders , acts of revenge have been carried out , " especially of @entity143 accused -- often , i think , quite wrongly -- of having fought for the @entity11 regime , " he said			2
in addition , " terrible evidence continues to come to light of the deliberate human rights abuses and crimes of the @entity11 regime , both those that took place over many years and during the fall of @entity0 , when many of the prisoners were massacred , " @entity92 said			1
" this is going to be a very heavy burden for @entity1 's new leaders as they seek to show that there will be accountability within the law for the worst violations , but at the same time promote national reconciliation			1
" the weight of that burden was underscored by a report by @entity165 that 18 bodies were discovered thursday in western @entity1			1
the find corroborates reports by two survivors that the dead had been detainees held by @entity11 forces in the town of @entity174 who were killed in june			2
the dead suffocated when they were locked inside two metal shipping containers , the group said			0
a captured @entity11 soldier led officials from the military council of @entity174 , about 120 kilometers ( 75 miles ) east of @entity0 , to the bodies , which were buried between @entity8 and @entity183 , @entity165 said			1
" the @entity11 forces threw detainees in metal containers with little water and air on a brutally hot day , and refused to let them out despite cries for help , " said @entity184 , special adviser at @entity165			2
a 19th person died a few days later , so was not buried with the other 18 , the group said			2
a video that appears to have been shot by a @entity11 soldier shows several of the detainees -- blindfolded and bound -- being kicked and whipped inside the container			0
meanwhile , an interim government is to be established within 30 days of the declaration of liberation , @entity94 envoy @entity92 said			1
until then , the @entity14 is assuming " caretaker responsibilities " to carry out urgently needed functions , he added			0
@entity94 secretary - general @entity203 has proposed a support mission for three months , after which " we would then go back to the @entity110 for a longer mandate , " @entity92 said			1
@entity2 's @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 contributed to this report .			0
