-- what a difference two debates have made			0
before the first presidential debate last week , president @entity4 appeared to be cruising toward re-election and possibly a thumping victory			2
after the first presidential debate , that changed dramatically : suddenly , we had a horse race			1
now after the vice presidential debate thursday night , we not only have a horse race , but partisans fired up on both sides			1
@entity15 relit the fire under @entity17 in a passionate , often dominant tangle with @entity19			2
going into that encounter , @entity17 spirits were not only drooping but some were beginning to panic that they were throwing away the election			0
@entity15 put a forceful stop to the caterwauling -- or , as @entity26 put it , righted the ship			0
he was especially effective in countering @entity19 on @entity28 and ( as @entity29 argued after the debate ) in making a case that a @entity33 administration could mean the end of @entity35			1
an old pro , @entity15 knows how to play to seniors , women and the middle class			0
opinion : debate coach -- it 's the @entity15 show ! but @entity43 took equal encouragement from @entity19 's performance			1
@entity19 was a steady , unflappable presence onstage who made an articulate set of arguments in favor of conservative principles while also seeming sensitive and reasonable to many moderates			2
@entity19 was also surprisingly strong on foreign policy , holding his own against a man far more schooled in the subject			2
overall , he more than justified @entity33 's judgment in choosing him as running mate			0
on substance , i called it a draw right after the debate ( as did @entity63 and a few others on our @entity0 team )			1
that was good news for both @entity15 and @entity19			2
the latter could claim credit for being one of the only two challengers who has ever fought a sitting vice president to at least a draw , the first being @entity71 against incumbent @entity75 in 1992			0
the @entity0 poll of registered voters who had watched the debate reached a similar conclusion : forty - eight percent said @entity19 won , 44 % said @entity15 , though the difference was within the poll 's margin of error			1
a @entity0 focus group thought it was a draw as well			0
( note to candidates : what the focus group liked most was when @entity15 and @entity19 said what their administrations would do to fix the economy			0
could we possibly hear more of that in the remaining presidential debates ? ) but there was another element to the debate that has aroused more controversy			1
as it did in the first presidential debate , @entity0 chose to show the two candidates on a split screen throughout the evening			1
watching that , i found @entity15 's frequent laughs at @entity19 to be off - putting -- and indeed , condescending			1
that plus the interruptions were in stark contrast to @entity19 's calm , even - keeled performance			1
so on style , i thought the edge went to @entity19			1
opinion : @entity114 , wonky @entity19 as often happens in these highly charged times , many @entity17 sharply disagreed with that judgment on @entity117			0
they thought i along with some colleagues were jackasses ( that is a very polite rephrasing of their language )			0
many cited a @entity125 poll after the election that found @entity15 a clear overall winner			0
what was lost in translation is that the @entity125 poll was of uncommitted voters and the @entity0 poll of all registered voters			1
recognizing there can be honest differences , i stand by my call -- @entity15 was overbearing in the early part of the debate and that diminished the impact of his arguments			0
taken altogether , the vice presidential debate did make a difference : @entity15 was able to help his boss out of the hole -- he helped to stabilize the race			2
but @entity19 was able to keep the @entity43 fired up , too			2
both campaigns now gallop forward , looking toward the next showdown this coming tuesday night when @entity0 's @entity148 is the moderator			1
it 's a close horse race with passions high , fans on their feet			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			0

@entity155 : two debates in two weeks have *transformed* presidential race
@entity155 says the polls have *tightened* , partisans on both sides are fired up
@entity0 poll gave a slight edge to @entity19 ; @entity155 says he had edge on style
@entity155 : tuesday 's town hall debate looks *increasingly* *important*
