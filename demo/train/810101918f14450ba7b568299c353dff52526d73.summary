@entity0 -- @entity3 gov. @entity2 refused to go onstage for the first seven minutes of a debate wednesday night , because his opponent had a fan			1
no , not a rowdy supporter in the audience			0
@entity2 's @entity11 challenger , former gov. @entity10 , had set up a small fan underneath his podium , apparently trying to keep himself from sweating under the @entity16 stage 's lights			1
@entity2 saw the fan , a prop that often accompanies @entity10 at public appearances , as a violation of the debate 's rules and said he would n't participate			1
the moderators tried to explain the disagreement while republicans in the audience chided @entity10 for breaking rules -- at least as @entity2 saw them -- against props on stage			1
" we have an extremely peculiar situation right now , " moderator @entity30 , a local news anchor , said as the broadcast started			0
" are we really going to debate a fan ? " @entity10 said while standing alone on stage			1
several minutes later , @entity2 relented and joined the debate			1
" that has to be the most unique beginning to any debate , " @entity30 said as @entity2 walked onto the stage			1
from there , the moderators largely tried to ignore the episode			0
and on thursday , @entity2 tried explain why his opponent needed a fan in the first place			2
" i think he was sweating and he needed a fan			0
i 'm surprised he did n't try to ask for dry ice , " @entity2 said			2
that could have actually been a solution to the standoff that took up the first seven minutes of the debate because @entity2 's protest flamed over @entity10 's apparent disregard for a previous agreement that electronic devices would be banned from the stage " i think he was probably worried about his track record , " @entity2 said , bringing up his campaign talking point that more than 832,000 people lost their jobs during @entity10 's four - year term as governor during the @entity65			1
but it had already sparked a social media firestorm , with @entity71 users launching the hashtag " # fangate , " and a mock @entity71 handle devoted solely to @entity10 's fan -- @ @entity75 -- had its moment in the sun. after the debate , the real @entity10 weighed in			2
" # fangate - what a night ! " he tweeted			0
" now , let 's get back to the issues that matter to @entity3			2
" but fangate was all some people could think about			0
many did n't know what to make of it			0
@entity11 wanted to make sure no one missed it			0
@entity90 political writer @entity89 wanted to know what @entity2 's advisers could have been thinking			2
you can watch video of the beginning of the debate here			0
update : an earlier version of this story misstated how many jobs gov. @entity2 said were lost in @entity3 while @entity10 was governor			1
@entity1 's @entity102 contributed to this report .			0
