@entity0 -- the journalist who first reported about a notebook that @entity4 allegedly sent his psychiatrist before last year 's horrific theater massacre could face jail time for not revealing her sources			1
@entity10 reporter @entity9 has been subpoenaed by @entity4 ' attorneys to testify on wednesday , but on monday judge @entity12 put off a ruling on whether @entity9 must reveal her source			1
winter has indicated that she has no plans to identify who told her the notebook from the accused @entity20 movie theater gunman was , as she reported , " full of details about how he was going to kill people			1
" " my reputation as a journalist will be irreparably tarnished among my colleagues and perhaps more importantly my future sources , " @entity9 wrote in a march affidavit			1
read the full affidavit days after the july 20 theater massacre in @entity31 , @entity20 , @entity9 scored a major scoop on @entity10 , reporting about the existence of the notebook			1
" the parcel may have sat unopened in a mail room for up to a week before its discovery monday ( july 23 ) , a law enforcement source told @entity10 , " @entity9 's july 25 article stated			1
she cited a source who said the notebook contained " drawings and illustrations of the massacre			2
" at the time of the article , the judge in the case had issued a so - called " gag order " barring officials from speaking to reporters about the case			0
other media , including @entity1 , later reported on the existence of the notebook sent by @entity4 to dr. @entity56 , the @entity57 psychiatrist who had treated him			1
it has since been discussed in open court , though the contents have not been revealed			0
@entity12 said monday he will not rule on the @entity9 issue until it is decided whether the notebook is admissible as evidence			1
if it is not admissible because it is privileged doctor - patient communication , then the credibility of the police officers who handled the notebook may be irrelevant to the case and not rise to the level required by @entity20 's shield law for forcing journalists to testify			0
but if @entity9 is ordered to reveal her source and does not , she could be found in contempt of court and jailed			1
@entity78 contacted police in june , a month before the massacre , and told them she had treated @entity4 and he " had stopped seeing her and had begun threatening her via text message , " according to a search warrant affidavit			1
@entity78 could face lawsuits that blame her and the school for improperly handling @entity4 ' treatment			2
@entity4 is charged with numerous counts of first - degree murder for allegedly opening fire inside a movie theater , killing 12 people and wounding dozens more at the premiere of the @entity94 movie " @entity95			1
" federal agents have said the 25 - year - old former @entity57 doctoral student planned the attack for months			0
his trial is scheduled to begin in february 2014			0
if convicted , he faces the death penalty			0
@entity4 ' attorneys have filed a series of motions and hearings in an attempt to find out who leaked the information about the notebook , calling to the stand all the police and bomb technicians who had access to the package			1
all have said they did not speak to any reporters about the package			0
within hours of its discovery , a judge ordered the package to be sealed and it has not been viewed by anyone since			0
saying they have exhausted all other avenues to identify the leaker , defense attorneys subpoenaed @entity9			1
she appeared in court last week on the same day prosecutors said they would pursue the death penalty against @entity4 , although she did not testify			2
@entity10 declined to comment on the case or make @entity9 available for interviews , and an e-mail to @entity9 's attorney at @entity10 went unanswered			1
the gag order is still in place , barring the defense team from commenting			0
@entity9 and her attorneys have tried to fight the subpoena			2
the @entity137 - based journalist made it clear in last month 's affidavit that her credibility is at stake if she were to reveal her sources			2
" i will be unable to function effectively in my profession and my career will be over , " @entity9 wrote			2
" this is not an exaggeration - it is a provable certainty			0
" she also said she has been subjected to threats on the internet by supporters of @entity4			0
@entity151 , who teaches media law at the @entity153 , expressed concern that @entity9 's case could have a chilling effect on investigative journalism and that journalists may be reluctant to pursue challenging stories that rely on confidential sources			2
" as a journalist , you ask yourself , ' do i sit in front of @entity165 ' house and snap some pics or do i cover this really important story and maybe go to jail , ' " he said			0
@entity151 argued that investigative journalism is in the public interest and @entity9 's case should be a rallying point for everyone interested in a free press			0
" if people want good important stories , we have to stand up for the reporters doing those stories , " he said .			0
