-- from @entity2 and @entity3 to @entity4 and @entity5 , @entity1 is no stranger to bleak , odd or evocative place names			1
towns like @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 are perfectly normal within the @entity1 context -- and locals use them without thinking -- but the country 's @entity14 has proposed tightening the regulations on naming places			1
local favorites like @entity19 -- a place name in @entity21 in @entity22 which is stoutly defended by locals -- would likely remain , but those that could be considered offensive , such as @entity26 , may be candidates for a future name cull			1
" we do n't want to stop @entity1 's tradition of weird and wonderful place names , " @entity14 deputy chairman @entity29 told @entity0			1
" we will consider anything as long as it 's not commercial or offensive			1
" we realize that working street names like @entity19 get a bit of a giggle , but provided they 're not offensive we wo n't go back and change them			1
" he said some of the more colorful suggestions from local councils for streets in new developments were often rejected for practical reasons			1
a council in the @entity22 town of @entity49 wanted to name a street .303 , after the ammunition , to recall the town 's military history			0
" but can you imagine being part of emergency services and being called to number 33 , @entity57 ? it 's simply not workable , " @entity29 said			0
" what we want is a unique name for every address in @entity1 -- we often get proposals that list a @entity64 , a @entity65 and a @entity66 all within close proximity of each other			1
" this is the sort of thing we want to avoid , " he said			0
he said that under the proposals , existing place names would be safe for the time being but the board would consider applications to rename streets if there were compelling circumstances			2
the guidelines outline which new place names would be accepted by the board -- those with @entity85 or multicultural origins are favored			0
he said the board often considered proposals to restore @entity85 place names and had two official names for many well - known places such as @entity91			1
warning , which is also called @entity93			0
@entity85 place names were particularly sensitive , however , especially if they marked known massacre sites			0
" we had a problem with a place called @entity98 which was named after a very one - sided massacre of @entity85 people at the site , " @entity29 said			0
" in the end , the local @entity85 council decided it was better to have the massacre site marked			0
there are some things you ca n't expunge from history			0
" under the proposed guidelines , places and roads named after living people , or those holding public office , are to be avoided because " community attitudes and opinions change over time			0
" he cited the example of @entity119 in @entity120 , named after the man who backed @entity1 's winning @entity123 team in the late 80s but went on to be jailed for fraud			1
cliches , too , are being weeded out and the board said it would prefer names that avoid repetition			0
for that reason , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 -- staples of many @entity1 towns -- have been placed on the " avoid " list			2
the regulations are not likely to please punctuation pedants , however , with the board saying it would eliminate apostrophes -- they 've already been eliminated from places including @entity150 -- and retain names that have been corrupted by long - established usage			2
@entity1 's most famous example of this is its highest peak @entity91			1
named after the @entity156 national hero @entity154 in 1840 , the @entity14 only reverted to the correct spelling ( it was previously spelt @entity158 ) in 1997			2
despite this , @entity1 still pronounce the name as " @entity161 - go			2
" the traditional @entity156 pronunciation of " kozh - tshush - ko " is almost never used			0
@entity29 said the missing ' z ' from @entity165 had been particularly controversial , drawing representation from the @entity156 community in @entity1 , the @entity156 ambassador and even the @entity169			2
" @entity165 is a national hero in @entity171			0
it was described to me as leaving the ' j ' out of @entity176 , " @entity29 said , referring to one of @entity1 's national poets .			1

@entity1 's @entity14 proposes tightening rules
names considered offensive , like @entity26 , could be changed
some proposals are rejected for practical reasons , others are just strange
@entity14 has moved to simplify names but removing some apostrophes
