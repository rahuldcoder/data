-- whenever a message in a bottle is discovered on a beach or floating in the ocean , it feels like something out of a fairy tale			1
the idea that two people have made a connection that mathematics would say is virtually impossible gives us hope that life is more than a series of random events			1
here are five stories of the almost unbelievable connections these messages have brought about			1
a soldier to watch over them when @entity22 was 10 years old , he dumped an entire bottle of his mother 's vanilla extract down the sink			1
he then wrote a quick note that said , " my name is @entity22			2
if you find this , put it on the news			1
the date is april 16 , 1995			2
" he stuffed the note inside the empty extract bottle and threw it into @entity38 's @entity37			1
life went on and , after high school , @entity22 signed up for the @entity41			1
during his tour of duty in @entity43 , he survived the dangers of fighting door - to - door in @entity46 and made it back home to the @entity49 safe and sound			2
tragically , shortly after his homecoming , @entity22 was killed in a car accident , leaving his family and friends devastated and asking the obvious question , " why ? " a few months later , @entity56 and @entity57 , friends of @entity22 's , were walking on the banks of @entity37 , when they saw something glimmer on the water			1
after fishing it out , they realized it was a vanilla extract bottle with a piece of paper inside			2
to friends and family , the message from 10 - year - old @entity22 appeared when they needed it most			1
it felt as though he was reaching out , letting them know that he was watching , and trying to help them move on			2
this message of hope is currently displayed in the @entity77 ' home as a constant reminder that their son is still with them , even though he 's gone			1
love in a bottle @entity83 was a lonely @entity85 sailor who decided to place his search for love in the hands of fate			1
he wrote a simple letter " to someone beautiful and @entity92 , " corked it inside a bottle , and tossed it overboard in the hopes that it might help him find a young woman to marry			1
two years later , in 1958 , he was surprised to receive a letter from a @entity97 girl , @entity96 , who said , " i am not beautiful , but it seems so miraculous that this little bottle should have traveled so far and long to reach me that i must send you an answer ... " the two began writing one another and , three years after he threw a bottle into the sea , @entity102 moved to @entity107 to marry his very long - distance love			1
@entity0 : six lost treasures waiting to be found 3			0
a ticket to freedom during a 1979 cruise to @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 passed the time by writing notes and throwing them overboard inside empty champagne bottles			0
they asked anyone who found one of their bottles to write them back , and even went so far as to include a $ 1 bill to cover the postage			0
on march 4 , 1983 , @entity115 's 70th birthday , the couple received a letter from @entity129			1
@entity129 , a former soldier in the @entity130 , said he and his younger brother had found one of the @entity134 ' bottles as the two men were floating 15 kilometers from the shore of @entity137 in @entity138			0
they were braving the waters of the @entity141 in a small , shallow riverboat in order to escape the communist regime in @entity145			0
when they saw the bottle , they felt as though a prayer had been answered , giving them the strength to carry on			1
after reading the letter , the @entity134 looked for @entity153 on a map and were shocked to find that the bottle had traveled 9,000 miles from @entity113			1
the @entity156 corresponded with @entity157 for years , sharing in his joy when they received a photo from his wedding , then again nine months later when they saw his newborn son			1
but most of all , they empathized with @entity157 's desire to give his family the best life he could			1
so when @entity157 asked if the @entity156 could help his family move to the @entity49 , they did n't hesitate			0
after months of working with @entity169 , the two families finally did meet in 1985 , when a plane from @entity138 landed in @entity171 -- the @entity173 ' new home			1
the right fisherman in 1999 , @entity175 spotted something clinging to his fishing nets			0
it was a very old bottle containing two letters written by pvt. @entity180 , dated september 9 , 1914			0
the first message asked the person that found the bottle to forward the second message to @entity180 ' wife , @entity185			2
the note for @entity185 was a nice , simple love letter , showing that his wife was in his thoughts as he made his way to @entity192 to fight in the early days of @entity193 after reading the letters , @entity175 felt a great personal responsibility to see that they found their way home , even though he assumed mrs. @entity199 had died long ago			0
he began searching for her descendants and soon learned that @entity180 and @entity199 ' daughter was still alive in @entity203 , @entity204			0
sadly , @entity180 died in battle shortly after he wrote the letters , so he never got to see @entity185 , nor his 2 - year old daughter , @entity206 , ever again			0
due to her young age at the time of his death , @entity206 never knew her father , though she grew up listening to stories about him from her mother and cherishing his posthumously award medals			2
so when the @entity215 offered to send @entity175 to @entity203 to hand - deliver the bottle to @entity206 , he jumped at the chance to help her connect to this lost piece of her past			0
for @entity206 , the bottle was a great source of joy and comfort			0
she said her father 's message could n't come home " until the right boat came along at the right time with the right fisherman			1
" @entity0 : why bottled water has an expiration date 5			2
@entity231 , meet @entity231 ( technically this is n't a " message in a bottle " story , but it 's the same concept -- and the story is simply too good not to mention it			1
) in june 2001 , @entity231 , who was almost 10 years old , released a red balloon into the air over her hometown of @entity242 in @entity243 , @entity244			0
on one side of the balloon , she had written " please return to @entity231 , " and on the other side , her home address			0
a few weeks later , a man 140 miles away in @entity250 found the balloon stuck in the hedge that separated his farm from the next - door neighbors			2
he noticed @entity231 's name and address and immediately took the balloon to the neighbors ' house , showing it to the 10 - year - old girl who lived there ... whose name was also @entity231			1
@entity231 from @entity250 wrote @entity231 from @entity242 to let her know that she had found the balloon			0
thinking this coincidence was simply too amazing to be true , they decided they had to meet in person			0
and that 's when things got really weird			2
on the day of the meeting , the two girls wore the same outfit -- a pink sweater and jeans			0
the girls were the same height , which was unusual because they were both tall for their age			2
they both had brown hair and wore it in the same style			0
they both had 3 - year - old black @entity282 retrievers at home , as well as gray pet rabbits			0
they both brought their guinea pigs , which were the same color and even had the same orange markings on their hindquarters			0
it was almost as though these two @entity291 were the same person			0
the strange events surrounding their meeting have helped the girls form a strong bond , and they remain friends eight years later			1
both feel the circumstances that brought them together are too significant to be written off as mere coincidence			0
