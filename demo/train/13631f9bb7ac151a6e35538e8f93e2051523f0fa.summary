long before the candidates set foot on stage in @entity4 , president @entity0 headed into the final debate of the 2012 campaign with the biggest advantage of all : he 's already commander - in - chief			1
the foreign policy face - off on monday was devoted to a subject on which presidents can speak about decision - making in the first person and challengers ca n't			1
as recently as a few weeks ago , coming off a rocky foreign summer tour and a widely panned response to the deadly september 11 attack on the @entity19 diplomatic mission in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 seemed headed for a tough night			2
but that was before the administration faced its own politically charged questions on the @entity21 assault over security and its response to what actually occurred and who may have been behind it			0
five things we learned from the final debate whether it was a reaction to the @entity38 's handling of the situation or just a reflection of @entity22 's overall growing strength , several recent polls suggested @entity0 's edge on foreign policy had narrowed			1
and @entity22 's biggest strength in the debates so far -- an aura of unshakeable confidence -- promised to be a critical asset in a night devoted to leadership			2
more than what he said , voters reacted to the way he said it			0
foreign policy is an area where many voters do n't feel entirely confident themselves ; @entity19 are less likely to have passionate and strongly held positions on currency speculation or trade negotiations than on abortion or taxes			1
read a transcript of the debate winning the policy debate is important			1
but looking like the stronger leader might be an even bigger priority			0
last time , @entity22 pushed so hard on details about the president 's response to the @entity20 attack that he unintentionally let him sidestep the heart of the original question about diplomatic security			2
it was a mistake he did n't seem likely to make twice			0
but this time , he barely pressed the president on @entity20			0
instead , the night played like a mirror image of the first debate			0
@entity22 approached the face - off with a cautious frontrunner strategy : a priority on appearing presidential and , wherever possible , emphasizing common ground			0
debate 's global reaction : disappointment and @entity0 took on the aggressive underdog role , needling @entity22 with virtually every response			1
on a night where sharp policy distinctions were in short supply , the president even tried to turn the areas of agreement into an attack : " you say you would do the same things we did , but you would just say them louder			1
" from one angle , @entity22 's approach -- to sound presidential and stay largely above the fray -- was the best strategy to win over the women voters he needs			0
and on a night where the final debate of campaign 2012 competed with both @entity108 and the pivotal game of baseball 's @entity111 championship , women may well have made up a larger share of the viewing audience than ever before			1
fact check : @entity0 , @entity22 and @entity116 but allowing your opponent to come across as the tough guy when the showdown is a 90 - minute audition for commander - in - chief is a risky strategy -- especially when you 're a challenger with a short foreign policy resume who needs to convince voters you 're strong leader who can keep the country safe			1
@entity22 had the benefit of seeing the president 's play - it - safe strategy flop in the first debate -- which made his decision to adopt it in the final one even more puzzling			2
so the only candidate with an actual foreign policy track record was n't the one who faced the toughest attacks tonight			1
the president did n't necessarily score a knockout -- but he did land the most punches			0
this was the last , best chance for @entity0 and @entity22 to make their pitch to a sizable audience in every battleground state			1
so , since foreign policy has n't exactly ranked high on voter priority lists this year , virtually every question ended up with an answer close to home			1
for more than 10 minutes , the debate stayed focused on domestic education policy , the deficit and jobs			2
@entity0 wins final debate , but does it matter ? a question about @entity19 's role in the world drew an answer about the @entity19 unemployment rate			1
@entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 all rated mentions ; @entity166 and the @entity167 did n't			0
the candidates had one , extended tense exchange over the auto bailout and " @entity172 " investment			0
in @entity175 's post-debate poll , voters gave @entity0 the edge on performance -- but that opinion did n't necessarily shift their votes			2
the most recent pre-debate surveys show @entity22 gains resulting in a virtual tie among likely voters nationally , and hinted at momentum in key swing states like @entity4			0
if @entity22 's measured performance drew higher marks from women or the vanishingly small sliver of remaining swing voters , he might be able to maintain that momentum			0
but unlike previous debates , there was a big gender gap , with women responding much more favorably to @entity0 's performance and men giving a small advantage to @entity22			1
the president has retained a healthy edge among registered voters ; if the debate boosts @entity205 enthusiasm , the likely voter model could shift , and the president would see a bump in the polls even if he failed to win over a single undecided voter			2
the first debate dramatically altered the campaign dynamic ; but in a race now so tight that 1 - or 2 - point swings practically rate surge status , the question is whether monday 's winner can expect any major impact at all			0
were your questions answered ? let us know on @entity221			0

@entity0 as president had a certain advantage on foreign policy in debate
winning debate key , but projecting strong leadership might be more important
last chance for both candidates to make impression before captive audience
