the gruesome gunning - down of 15 - year - old @entity0 spotlighted the fate of children in @entity3 , one of the world 's most dangerous places to go to school			1
but in war zones around the world , from @entity13 to @entity14 , students , teachers and schools are regularly coming under attack			1
these are the world 's unrecognized @entity16			0
in southern @entity19 , i visited a school that was still smoldering from an arson attack a few days earlier			1
separatist insurgents had doused the classrooms with gasoline and dragged books from the library and mattresses from the kindergarten to fuel the flames			0
the insurgents view schools as places where the @entity34 @entity19 government indoctrinates the local @entity37 @entity36 population			1
@entity38 : millions of children face @entity0 's fight for an education the school 's teachers were distraught but worried that if they fled the area , the children would be left with no one to teach them			1
these teachers ' bravery is astounding : this month , three bullets to the head felled @entity51			0
he was the 152nd teacher to be assassinated since violence erupted in southern @entity19 in 2004			1
in the past five years , armed forces and armed groups have attacked or taken over schools in at least 25 countries , endangering children 's lives , education and future			1
armed groups target schools and teachers as symbols of the state			2
they oppose what is being taught , and to whom			0
these attacks are not a matter of collateral damage ; they are part of deliberate , despicable strategies			0
opinion : candidates , answer the @entity0 question this year in eastern @entity14 , i met a 14 - year - old boy who explained how @entity80 - linked extremists had replaced the teachers and curriculum at his school			1
pointing to a card i brought displaying pictures of various weapons , he identified five that his new " teachers " had taught him and his classmates to use			0
i met another 14 - year - old in @entity14 's capital , @entity91 , who told me how frightened he had been when the principal led students into the basement to escape gunfire aimed at the militia that had established a base on the school 's top floor			1
" you could n't recognize that this was a school because of the military barracks here , " one teacher told me			0
in central @entity106 , i sifted through the shrapnel and splintered desks in a school that had been bombed by @entity111 guerrillas			1
" this school has been badly damaged , " lamented a 16 - year - old student showing me around			0
" everything is in ruins			0
" in @entity106 , the @entity116 attack schools because the isolated pink buildings make easy targets in rural areas otherwise devoid of government structures			1
but in doing so , the @entity116 harm the country 's most marginalized and needy : the very children for whom they claim to be fighting			2
safe schools offer essential protection for children in wartime			2
they can provide lifesaving information about things like avoiding land mines and preventing @entity133			0
they can also shield children from trafficking and recruitment by armed groups			0
in the long term , a good education promotes peace and post-conflict reconstruction , and helps young people develop the skills to build lives for themselves and prosperity for their communities			2
perhaps most important , access to a safe space to study and learn provides students with a sense of normality , routine and calm amid the chaos of war			2
opinion : a year later , can @entity156 tame militias ? ending attacks on students , teachers and schools requires action at both the national and international levels			1
we need a shared recognition that such attacks can amount to war crimes and need global attention			2
where attacks occur , the @entity169 should be allowed access to negotiate with armed groups to end grave violations against children			0
( @entity19 recently denied the @entity169 access to verify the crimes being committed against children in the south			1
) we also need better preventive measures and a more timely response			0
destroyed schools should be quickly rebuilt , not left as piles of rubble like so many in @entity3			2
militaries should commit to refraining from converting schools into military bases and barracks , to prevent turning schools into targets			2
in @entity192 right now , school buildings are being bombed as both sides target each other 's bases set up inside classrooms			0
the cause for which @entity0 risked her life -- ensuring that children , no matter where they live , can enjoy an education in safety and security -- has received new attention since her bloody attack			1
let us work to ensure that it does not take more @entity16 for the world to react and give attacks on schools the attention it deserves .			0

@entity215 : @entity0 shooting reminds that schools , globally , are *besieged* in war zones
he says schools attacked in 25 nations in past 5 years , *including* @entity14 , @entity19 , @entity106
he says militias use them for fighting , they become targets ; kids lose stability , education
@entity215 : @entity232 must see this as war crime , put protections in place , even in war
