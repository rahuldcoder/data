other issues include landing permits and airport fees as well as maintenance support and pilot training and licensing			0
@entity39 says that a common set of standards needs to be adopted throughout the continent " so that you have the ability to fly into @entity3 with a sense of security , that you know that safety and the procedures are all in place			1
