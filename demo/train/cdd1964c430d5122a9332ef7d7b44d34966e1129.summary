-- a class - action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of three immigrant women who were allegedly sexually assaulted while in the custody of @entity5 in @entity6 , the @entity3 said this week			1
the @entity3 , citing documents it said it had obtained through the @entity9 , said in a news release that there have been nearly 200 allegations of sexual abuse of immigration detainees jailed at detention facilities across the @entity16 since 2007			2
the @entity3 release did not give dates of any of the alleged assaults , including those involving the three women who are plaintiffs in the class - action suit			1
the plaintiffs were identified only as @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 " to protect them from further harm , " the @entity3 said			0
the alleged attacks occurred while the plaintiffs were being transported from the @entity32 @entity31 in @entity33 , @entity6 , to the airport or bus station in nearby @entity36 , the @entity3 said			0
its release did not say where the class - action suit was filed wednesday , but it said defendants include three @entity5 officials ; @entity41 , @entity6 , where the @entity43 facility is ; the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) , a private prison company that manages the @entity43 facility ; the former facility administrator for @entity43 ; and a guard at the facility			1
the lawsuit alleges that @entity5 along with @entity41 and the @entity44 were " deliberately indifferent and willfully blind to the fact that ( the guard named as a defendant ) and other employees regularly violated the rule that detainees are not be transported without another escort officer of the same gender present , " the @entity3 said			1
@entity5 did not comment specifically on the @entity3 's announcement of the lawsuit , but an agency spokeswoman said @entity5 " maintains a strict zero tolerance policy for any kind of abusive or inappropriate behavior and requires all contractors working with the agency to adhere to this policy			1
" @entity5 public affairs officer @entity68 added that the agency requires regular criminal backgrounds checks for its workforce			0
" the ( @entity73 ) @entity74 and @entity5 's @entity75 investigate all allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct and the agency takes appropriate action -- whether it is pursuing criminal charges or administrative action -- when those allegations are substantiated , " @entity68 said in the @entity5 statement			1
the @entity44 did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the @entity3 announcement			0
the @entity3 said it was basing its claim that there have been 185 allegations of sexual abuse in federal detention centers against female immigration detainees on various federal documents			0
the documents -- obtained from the @entity73 's @entity74 , @entity97 and @entity5 , according to the @entity3 -- showed that @entity6 had more alleged abuse cases , 56 , than any other state , the organization 's news release said			2
" while the information gleaned from the documents likely does not represent the full scope of the problem given that sexual abuse is notoriously underreported , the documents nonetheless make clear that the sexual abuse of immigration detainees is not an isolated problem limited to a few rogue facilities or to a handful of bad - apple government contractors who staff some of the nation 's immigration jails , " the @entity3 said			0
" unfortunately , we believe these complaints are just the tip of the iceberg , " said @entity114 , senior staff attorney for the @entity3 of @entity6 .			2
