-- @entity1 might just be the most optimistic man in @entity2 right now -- for there are few who would back his assertion that the @entity7 cricket team faces anything other than " @entity9 "			1
thrashed by @entity2 for the second consecutive time in the five - match contest , @entity7 must now overcome 77 years of history to win the series			1
not since 1936 - 37 has a team come from 2 - 0 down to win the @entity15 -- on that occasion it was @entity2 which triumphed			1
what appears more likely is that @entity7 's horrific 5 - 0 whitewash defeat of 2006 - 7 will be replicated -- especially given monday 's 218 - run defeat in @entity21			1
" it 's certainly not impossible , " @entity7 captain cook told a press conference following the day 's play			2
" a lot of people who will be sitting in this room , and outside , will probably give us no chance			0
" but if we do n't believe that in our dressing room , if we believe the urn has gone , then it might as well have gone			0
" obviously 2 - 0 is not a great situation to be in			1
but if you look at a football game , the next goal can change it very quickly			0
" @entity7 , which has won the past three @entity15 series , has struggled from the outset against an @entity2 side which it defeated 3 - 0 only a few months ago			1
only once before have @entity7 lost successive tests by a margin of more than 200 runs , but following the 381 - run loss in @entity46 , it now faces an almighty challenge to avoid humiliation			2
many of @entity7 's problems have come in their batting line up which has failed to pass 400 in its past 20 test matches			2
it now heads to @entity55 where it has only managed one win in 12 attempts and the scene of a 267 - run defeat three years ago			1
one of the most frightening prospects for @entity7 is facing @entity2 's fast - bowler @entity63 , who has already taken 17 wickets in the first two matches			1
the extra pace and bounce in @entity55 will make @entity63 even more dangerous -- an intimidating proposition considering the paceman took nine wickets at the @entity71 the last time these two met			2
captain cook has struggled for runs at the top of the order while the likes of @entity78 and @entity76 have also failed to live up to their billing			0
needing 284 more runs for a final day triumph , @entity7 never looked like pulling off a miraculous victory			0
instead , it lost its final four wickets for just 65 runs			0
a win for @entity2 at @entity55 will seal its first @entity15 triumph since 2007 -- not bad for a team which has only won two if its past 12 @entity90 matches			1
" it 's going to take a monumental effort from us to do it , " added @entity1			0
" but we 're the only guys who can turn it round			0
" it was a better display in this second innings			0
( it was ) by no means perfect , at all , but it was better than it had been			0
" that 's a small step , only a small step , but it 's heading in the right direction			0
" @entity2 captain @entity101 , who is expected to make his 100th @entity90 appearance at @entity55 on friday , is in confident mood following his side 's strong start to the series			1
@entity101 , who made 148 in the first innings at @entity21 , says the hard work his players put in during the @entity111 summer has finally come to fruition			2
" it 's not a fluke we have won the first two @entity90 matches ... we believe , after the work we have been putting in for a long period of time , we 're seeing some results			1
" the other side to that is , the reality is we have won two @entity90 matches now in the past 12 months - and that is not acceptable as an @entity123 test team			1
" we have started this series very well , but there is a lot of work still to do			0
" one man who is entitled to enjoy @entity2 's current success more than any other is @entity63 -- the man who was subjected to constant taunting from the @entity7 supporters during the 2010 - 11 series			1
@entity63 did not feature in the last @entity15 contest and @entity7 's batsmen must be wishing he was overlooked for this current series with the @entity123 striking fear into his opponents at every opportunity			2
" i guess having that intimidation factor is definitely a bonus , " @entity63 told reporters			0
" it was n't probably quite there in the last couple of @entity15 series for me - so to be able to come out , just back my ability , and know what i wanted to bowl , i will continue to do that throughout the series			2
" i wo n't let myself get too excited ... it 's all about not getting too far ahead of yourself			0
