my son @entity0 and his wife were taken at gunpoint from their apartment in @entity6 more than 200 days ago			1
since then , he has been languishing in a jail with no firm trial date in sight			0
our patience has been exhausted			0
it is time to release my son or let him face a fair trial			1
@entity0 , the @entity16 's @entity15 bureau chief , was taken with his wife , @entity17 , from their apartment on july 22			1
@entity0 , a dual @entity6 - @entity19 citizen , has been at @entity20 , held on suspicion of somehow posing a security risk to @entity6			1
@entity17 was released in early october , and through november she was permitted three phone calls and two visits each week			0
but last month , she was only permitted one brief visit			0
in a meeting december 22 with two members of @entity0 and @entity17 's interrogation team , i was informed : " @entity29 has an unfair view of us ( the @entity32 )			1
we do not rape , we do not torture ; we do not waterboard			0
... we do everything by @entity36 , true @entity36 law			0
" when i visited my son in @entity20 on christmas day , he told me : " i will be a model prisoner if i am granted my rights under @entity36 law			0
rights attributed to @entity42 , a fair and just man			0
and i do n't believe i 've been granted any of them : the right to meet with my attorney , my trial scheduled in a timely manner , and visitation rights with my wife			0
" following my trip , @entity6 newspapers -- moderate and hard - line alike -- highlighted that i had met with @entity0 twice			1
last weekend , in @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity6 foreign minister @entity53 commented on his role in that process			2
but while i sincerely appreciate @entity53 's " humanitarian " efforts , as well as the orchestrating of @entity0 's one telephone call to me for @entity62 , the fact is that as a dual citizen and therefore @entity6 mother , it is my right to visit my son in prison			1
in fact , in the early months , i was told the @entity6 were asking @entity0 , " where is your mother ? " when i was n't there all the time because they are so accustomed to seeing mothers waiting outside the prison gates			1
yet in january , i was given no assurances of permission for further visits			0
@entity6 's ways are often inscrutable			1
there are apparently three separate security apparatuses , and @entity0 seems now to have been handed off to a legal branch ( the judiciary ) that appears to be taking its time scheduling his trial			1
@entity6 's @entity84 spells out that once a prisoner 's file is completed , the prisoner is to be moved to a public ward , where he can interact with others and have access to a telephone			1
furthermore , once assigned to a court , a trial date must be set within 60 days			0
as his file was sent in early january , the case should be heard in early march			0
and yet there are rumblings that @entity0 's case will not be heard until after @entity100 , the @entity100 , which is on the first day of spring , march 21			1
anyone with knowledge of @entity6 knows that nothing happens during the two weeks following @entity100 , a period when even newspapers do n't publish , so it can only be assumed his trial date might not be set before april 6			2
all this is taking a huge toll on @entity0			2
it weighs heavily on him knowing how much his wife , his brother , their families and our relatives in the @entity19 and @entity6 are worrying about him			2
and it deeply pains him to know that this situation has come about because of suspicions -- no matter how baseless -- about his contacts and associations			0
all this frustration is compounded by the knowledge that the length of his detention far exceeds that of other @entity19 journalists in @entity6			2
this week , @entity6 is celebrating the anniversary of the @entity126			2
it is traditionally a time when pardons are granted and prisoners are released on bail to visit with their families			0
@entity0 is fully aware of this			2
whatever the unknown charges against him may be , surely @entity0 is at the least entitled to regular visits from his wife and phone calls with his mother ? our family has been exceedingly patient during these seven months			2
we have been respectful of @entity6 , of its laws and its procedures			0
but our patience ran out some time ago , and it is difficult , nearly impossible , to maintain respect for a system under which someone who was born and raised @entity19 is being detained " as an @entity6 " even as his rights under @entity6 's own laws are being so flagrantly violated			1
i am calling on @entity6 human rights minister @entity150 , @entity53 , president @entity151 and the @entity152 , ayatollah @entity153 , to ensure that @entity0 's rights are observed			1
please review the evidence and release my son or ensure that he receives a fair trial immediately			1
it is long past time .			0

the @entity16 's @entity0 has been detained in @entity6 since july
