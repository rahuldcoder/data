the @entity9 champions are unbeaten at home in more than two years ahead of next week 's return leg , but the 2009 titleholders took control of the quarterfinal with a typically dominant display in the @entity17 capital to match @entity4 's four - goal demolition of @entity19 on tuesday			1
@entity22 , playing further forward than his usual midfield role , settled any signs of nerves for the home fans inside two minutes when he pounced to score after @entity27 's intended pass to strike partner @entity28 was deflected into the 2010 @entity31 match - winner 's path			0
the @entity33 star then set up @entity34 for the second goal in the 34th minute with a clever pass over the defense that the @entity39 fullback pushed wide of goalkeeper @entity40 and flicked into the net with the outside of his right foot			2
@entity4 overpower 10 - man @entity19 @entity34 turned provider eight minutes after halftime with a low corner that allowed central defender @entity48 to fire in a deflected shot after pulling back to lose his marker			2
it was @entity48 's second goal in as many matches , having volleyed the winner from @entity34 ' flicked - on corner against @entity56 on saturday that put @entity1 eight points clear of @entity4 in the @entity60 title race			1
@entity6 reduced the deficit in the 59th minute when defender @entity62 stole in at the near post to put @entity65 's freekick past goalkeeper @entity66 with his knee			0
but @entity69 's team responded within 60 seconds as top scorer @entity27 surged towards the penalty area and teed up @entity72 , who smashed a superb left - foot shot into the top corner of the net			1
@entity77 record falls -- but will it ever be beaten ? @entity39 striker @entity78 almost made it 4 - 2 with nine minutes to play but his shot from a tight angle hit the post and bounced safely into the arms of a relieved @entity66			0
@entity27 had the ball in the net soon after , but his provider @entity87 -- who made his return from injury as a 70th - minute replacement for @entity92 -- was ruled to be offside			0
however , the fifth goal came soon after when @entity34 made his way into the box and provided a perfect low cross for midfielder @entity97 -- another player returning from injury -- to steal in unmarked and sidefoot into the net .			0
