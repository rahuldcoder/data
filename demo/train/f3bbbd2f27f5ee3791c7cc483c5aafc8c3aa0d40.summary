" it was the late night host 's first day back from a week - long hiatus that occurred at the same time news broke about a new succession plan for " @entity13			1
" @entity3 , who replaced @entity14 as host of " tonight " for seven months until he was pushed aside in 2010 , chose to joke about @entity16 and the @entity17 instead of his former employer , or the comedian who 's now about to lose his high - profile gig on @entity21 to @entity22			1
@entity21 's @entity14 plan has some insiders baffled " @entity13 is the beginning of the 8 - day @entity27 holiday of @entity16 , when @entity28 freed the @entity27 from slavery in @entity30 , " according to an early transcript from @entity3 's monologue			1
" in other words , @entity34 's first @entity33			0
@entity16 's the time every year i 'm forced to spend 8 days and 8 nights writing all my own jokes			1
" he continued , " over the weekend , the current pope and the former pope had lunch together			0
the waiter who served them said they spent the whole time b * * * * * * g about their boss			0
" @entity3 's best joke ? probably this one about @entity51 , who is offering " $ 100,000 to anyone who can design a better condom			2
of course , what guy wants to buy a condom from a company called ' @entity57			0
' " @entity3 's guests for the night were @entity59 , @entity60 and musical guest @entity61			1
his shows airs weeknights at 11 p.m. et / @entity63 @entity14 , in contrast , has relied on the ongoing bruhaha for nightly jokes on " tonight			2
" on friday , @entity14 said this in his monologue : " have you heard about this alleged feud that i 'm having with @entity21 ? i think it 's going to be ok			2
this is real : i had dinner last night with a bunch of @entity21 executives			2
to make it up to me , what they did , they are sending my wife and i on an all expenses paid carnival cruise			0
how about that ? so it looks like it 's going to be ok			0
fantastic ! " @entity14 's friday jokes : knifed in the back by @entity21 @entity21 has yet to officially confirm multiple reports that say @entity89 will succeed @entity14 no later than fall of 2014 , and that " @entity13 " will be relocated to @entity90			1
