@entity1 , @entity2 -- " it is a jungle , " the taxi driver told me			1
" it is a jungle and we are the rabbit surrounded by lions			2
" it 's a dramatic analogy , but one that accurately sums up @entity2 ' disgust and helplessness at what they perceive to be the ultimate betrayal by the @entity15			1
the last two weeks have been the most dramatic in decades for @entity16 @entity2 , still reeling from the harsh terms of a â ‚ ¬ 10 billion bailout from international lenders to save the island nation 's banking sector			1
large bank deposit holders are being forced to take huge losses , and unprecedented limits on the movement of cash have been imposed here			1
@entity28 : @entity2 ' banks reopen for first time in two weeks the prevailing mood is one of utter helplessness			1
@entity16 @entity2 are used to fighting			1
they fought @entity34 for the very land they live on			2
but today there is no battle to fight against the nameless , faceless group of @entity15 and @entity41 bureaucrats and officials who have now become deeply involved in the future of their country			2
" we wanted to be @entity48 's friend , " continues the driver , " but now it is turning on us			0
" it 's difficult not to sympathize			0
groups of locals sit in pavement cafes in the capital city of @entity1 , anxiously watching state television , waiting for the next move , waiting for the next development in a seismic event which has rocked the @entity2 economy to its very core			1
every interview , every comment is being dissected assiduously			0
the biggest question this week was whether money would really be there when @entity2 ' banks finally reopened thursday			1
it is , but it can only be withdrawn â ‚ ¬ 300 at a time			1
but @entity2 are also discussing and arguing about the long - term effects of the bailout			1
what does austerity mean ? how come the @entity72 and the @entity73 did n't lose their savings ? why us ? walking down @entity1 's main shopping streets , there is little sign of an economic crisis			0
no queues at the @entity81			0
tourists are browsing through the many local stores			0
heated discussions over @entity2 coffee can be heard everywhere , and although i ca n't understand the words , i can sense the frustration			1
these people are stuck in a state of limbo			0
journalists bandy the term " an uneasy calm " around quite a lot , but it seems a perfect fit to describe the mood here			0
what 's the point in getting angry if you do n't know what you 're getting angry about ? what can you say to the government when their hands are being forced by @entity48 ? what does it all mean for @entity2 ? ironically , it is @entity2 ' youth who seem to have foreseen the long term effect of the bailout			1
hundreds of high school students have taken to the streets to voice their dismay over what they see as a threat to their future , though they were n't blaming the government for everything			1
placards bearing unflattering comments about the @entity125 chancellor @entity124 peppered their morning marches , orchestrated to pass under the gaze of the cameras of hundreds of journalists who set up camp in one of @entity1 's main squares and at the parliament building			0
the feeling of worry was palpable			0
the @entity137 might lose their money , the young protesters seemed to be saying , but what about us ? we could have just lost our future			2
i reached the end of the street and at the border crossing stumbled across a completely different , more @entity34 side of @entity2			2
i walked about 100 meters and spotted the bank			0
the bank 's doors were open , its @entity34 flag blowing in the wind			0
here people are pleased with the weather			0
it 's the high season for tourists and hopefully this year will be fruitful			0
spare a thought for your @entity16 counterparts ? a shop assistant shrugged			0
what the long term effect of this bailout will be is anybody 's guess			2
the rules change every day and while the government insists that the bailout -- and all that comes with it -- is the lesser of two evils , the people sitting in the cafes , those trying to run a business , and the shoe shiner trying to eek out a living remain unconvinced			2
the last two weeks have shattered @entity2 ' confidence in their country , and the people are fully aware that like a rabbit in the jungle , @entity2 has been well and truly cornered .			1

@entity2 ' banks reopen for first time in nearly two weeks
@entity2 agreed to allow big losses for large deposit holders in exchange for â ‚ ¬ 10 billion bailout
young @entity2 see the bailout and its harsh terms as a threat to their future
