pope @entity0 has stirred up a hornet 's nest with remarks in which he said it 's ok for parents to spank children , so long as they do it with dignity			1
the comments came in his general audience wednesday in @entity12 , when @entity0 was talking about the importance of a good father within a family			1
" i once heard at a wedding a father say , ' i sometimes have to hit my children a little but never in the face , so as to not demean them			1
' how nice , i thought , he has a sense of dignity , " the @entity0 said			2
" when he punishes , he does it right and moves on			0
" @entity1 parents : ok to discipline another parent 's child ? the principle of not humiliating the child while doling out the punishment appears to be central to the @entity0 's justification of spanking , as is that of forgiveness			1
" a good father knows how to wait and knows how to forgive from the bottom of his heart			1
of course he can also discipline with a firm hand : he 's not weak , submissive , sentimental , " he said			0
" this father knows how to discipline without demeaning ; he knows how to protect without restraint			1
" the issue of corporal punishment for children is divisive in many countries , and the @entity0 's remarks prompted an outpouring of both support and criticism on social media			1
father @entity50 , a @entity51 spokesman , told @entity1 that it was important not to take the @entity0 's words out of context -- and that there was an important distinction to be made between discipline and punishment			1
" it 's about time that we stop and allow the @entity0 to speak the language of most ordinary people , especially parents , who understand the @entity0 far better than those who parse every single word and statement that comes out of his mouth ! " he said			2
opinion : spanking is n't child abuse ; it 's common sense " let us not read into the @entity0 's words anything other than what is there			2
he speaks constantly of mercy and tenderness			0
he speaks as a pastor and loving father figure who loves children and wants the best for them			2

the @entity108 is not one of the nations where corporal punishment is banned , but an anti-spanking movement has gained momentum there			0
