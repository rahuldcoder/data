@entity0 how 's this for a miraculous outcome ? a @entity5 man who was stabbed in the head during an argument survived despite the knife being lodged in his skull for over three hours			1
motorcycle taxi driver @entity10 was at a party in a bar in the city of @entity14 , in northeastern @entity16 state , last sunday when he got into an altercation			2
the 39 - year - old was stabbed four times , three times in the torso , with one wound perforating a lung , and once in the head			1
he was first taken for treatment at a nearby hospital before being transferred to the @entity25 of @entity26 , a city 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) away -- with the knife handle protruding from his head all the while			1
" it took him nearly three hours to arrive here at the hospital , " dr. @entity32 , general surgeon and hospital director , told @entity1 on friday			2
" he had the knife lodged in his head for this whole period but he was not aware of it , " he said			0
" we believe the shock and a bit of the drinking may have helped him not to understand the knife was still in his head			0
" pictures released by the military show @entity10 lying on a hospital trolley with what looks like a kitchen knife embedded in his skull up to the handle , just to the side of his left eyebrow			1
according to @entity56 , the knife stopped only when it got stuck in the man 's lower jaw			1
@entity10 was very lucky , he said -- and not just to be alive			2
" the knife crossed his head just behind the optical nerve , got very close to the olfactory nerve and ( was ) just a fraction from the gustatory nerve			0
he could have been blinded and could have lost his senses of smell and taste , but none of that happened and he is alive and healthy			0
" the surgery to remove the knife was very delicate , since any slip could have breached arteries and led the patient to bleed to death , @entity56 said			0
it took the hospital surgery team two and half hours to complete , and was considered to be a success			0
" he left the hospital yesterday , five days after coming in with a knife in his head , " @entity32 said			1
