-- when you 're on a roller coaster , thrills and chills are to expected			2
standing still -- for hours , high above the @entity4 ? not so much			0
but that 's the experience riders on the @entity7 got wednesday night , when the @entity9 attraction stalled due to what park spokesman @entity10 called a technical glitch			1
the coaster did what it was supposed to do , when that happened around 7 p.m : it came to a stop about 140 feet above the ground , @entity10 said			1
what the ride -- which towers , at its highest point , 17 stories above the theme park -- did n't do was promptly start again			1
while the cars toward the front were at least closer to level , with a view over the hill , those farther behind were " sitting straight back with no way to move , because it 's straight down , " one park visitor , @entity24 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity33			1
most riders were able to be safely taken off but , more than two hours later , about 10 still remained			0
the @entity35 was called in to pluck off these stranded few about 2Â½ hours after the ordeal began			1
one female rider was transported to the hospital complaining of neck and back pain , according to @entity10			0
asked whether this had happened before , @entity10 said , " yes , we 've had similar incidents			0
" on its website , @entity9 bills the @entity7 as the tallest roller coaster in the theme park - filled central @entity47 city			1
peaking at 65 mph , the coaster features what the park calls a " record - breaking loop " about other twists and turns			1
" we are going to work to understand what happened tonight before we reopen the ride again , " @entity10 said			0
downs , for one , is open to hopping on the coaster again , feeling that mechanical issues will happen no matter how well maintained a ride is			0
but his daughter -- who was " scared half to death " before they rode the @entity7 just before it got stuck -- might not feel the same			2
" i said , ' it will be ok , they took good care of their stuff , ' " downs said			0
" thank goodness it was n't us			0
" @entity73 roller coaster reopens after woman 's death			2
