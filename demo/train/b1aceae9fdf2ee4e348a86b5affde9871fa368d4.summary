-- after reaching a record high of 14,253.77 on tuesday , the @entity2 industrial average rose an additional 0.3 % on wednesday to reach a new record high of 14,296.39			1
first off , the latest @entity2 number is not really a record			1
if we adjust it for inflation , the @entity2 still has a way to go			1
but is the rising number a sign that the economy , which has been improving sluggishly , is about to improve dramatically ? probably not			2
for example , the previous peak in the @entity2 in 2007 was just before the onset of the @entity16 , and remember what happened then ? right , the economy crashed			1
no -- not really , but there was plenty of fear going around			0
some people are surprised that the stock market is doing so well , particularly in light of such high levels of unemployment			1
but maybe we should welcome the optimism since it can push along the economy			2
the steady rise of the @entity2 since early 2009 has been driven mainly by two factors : the slow improvement in economic conditions and optimism since the recession ended , and the @entity40 's attempt to stimulate the economy using quantitative easing policies			1
under the policies , the @entity40 has purchased large volumes of financial assets , and the increase in demand for these assets from the @entity40 has lowered long - term interest rates and put upward pressure on the prices of stocks and bonds			2
as asset prices increase , people feel wealthier and more secure because of increased value of retirement funds , education savings , and so on , and the increase in wealth and security makes it more likely that consumers will spend money on goods and services			0
this boosts gdp and employment , and the improved outlook for the economy can increase stock prices even further			2
a case in point -- my parents			0
they are retired and did a lot of traveling			0
but when the 2007 recession hit and wiped out their retirement savings and equity in their home , they stopped traveling and instead began trying to rebuild what had been lost			0
they hunkered down , waiting for the storm to pass so to speak			0
gradually , they started to spend a bit more as stock prices and the economy improved , but they are not yet back to where they were before the recession			2
my parents are more optimistic now , and that spurs them to spend more , which helps businesses and the economy			0
there are many @entity100 who went through similar experiences			0
if we add all of them together , we can see why things seem better than before			0
more people feel like we 're on the right track			0
the high stock market prices reflect this sentiment			1
but the real question remains : what does the @entity2 tells us about the future of the economy ? there is some evidence that the stock market can predict economic prospects , but the correlation is unreliable			1
the improvement in the @entity2 is a good sign , but let 's not treat it as reading the tea leaves			1
just as no one can predict the stock market , no one can really predict the economy , even if the @entity2 is doing great			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity130 .			0

@entity130 : the latest @entity2 number is not really a record when adjusted for inflation
@entity136 : it 's good that the stock market is doing well , but it 's not a reliable predictor of economy
he says @entity40 's policy of quantitative easing has contributed to @entity2 's rise
@entity136 : *general* optimism has also helped push the stock market up
