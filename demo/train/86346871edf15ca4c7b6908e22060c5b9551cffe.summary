-- you 've seen it a hundred times , in any thriller that finds the hero perched on a ledge or on the edge of a building 's rooftop			1
the camera moves up and tilts downward , in a smooth unbroken shot , so that we can all know that the actor is really standing there			0
by now we 're more than ready for that shot ( it 's become fairly ho - hum )			2
but there 's no way that i was ready for the extraordinary , dread - inducing @entity20 , no safety net ! sequence in " mission : impossible -- ghost protocol " where @entity26 makes his way across the surface of the @entity29 in @entity30 -- the world 's tallest skyscraper -- while clinging to the building 's glass panels with a pair of electrified adhesive gloves			1
@entity26 , as @entity37 agent @entity36 , is trying to break into the suite that houses the skyscraper 's - computer servers , and this is the only way he can do it without being detected from within			1
@entity43 , the director of @entity25 , knows all too well that the audience will be on the lookout for any tell - tale cut , any obvious digital image , anything at all that reveals that @entity26 is n't really on the side of that skyscraper			1
and damned if we can find one ! this is a sequence so ingeniously conceived and shot that even the audience does n't want to look down -- a sequence so death - defying that it gets you laughing at your own susceptibility ( especially if , like me , you happen to have a fear of heights )			0
shimmying up and down and around the building 's surface , with the ground looking as if it must be a mile below , @entity26 becomes a fearless human bug ( think @entity68 without the superpowers )			2
then , just as we 're sure that our hearts could n't dig any deeper into our throats , one of his gloves begins to short out and lose adhesive power			0
do n't you hate when that happens ? ' @entity77 ' : @entity78 talks the game - changing season finale " @entity25 " brims with scenes that are exciting and amazing at the same time ; they 're brought off with such casual aplomb that they 're funny , too			1
early on , @entity36 and a fellow agent , the nattering tech nerd @entity85 ( @entity86 ) , have to penetrate the archive room of the @entity90 , and they do it in captivating silence by hiding behind a scrim that projects , to the security guard , an exact image of the hallway they 're in ( minus the two of them )			2
it 's the spy equivalent of a magic trick , and that 's the spirit of the whole movie			0
" @entity25 " is fast and explosive , but it 's also a supremely clever sleight - of - hand thriller			1
@entity43 , the animation wizard ( " @entity107 , " " @entity108 " ) , makes the leap to live action with the kind of skill @entity112 brought to the " @entity115 " films , only @entity43 , showing an animator 's miraculously precise use of visual space , has a playful , screw - tightening ingenuity all his own			0
' @entity120 ' recap : you oughta show after an epic explosion rocks the @entity90 , the entire @entity37 gets '' disavowed , '' and @entity36 and his team find themselves cut off , without backup			1
suddenly they 're rogue agents , like an espionage version of the @entity129 's gang , only with far more important priorities			0
their mission is to stop @entity133 ( @entity132 , dour costar of the @entity136 girl with the " @entity138 " films ) , a lone terrorist who has stolen the @entity140 nuclear codes , from launching a missile and kicking off a nuclear war			0
all because he 's a nihilist nut who really wants to			0
@entity36 's team , aside from @entity85 ( played by @entity86 with impish timing ) , includes the terrific @entity147 as the dangerously beautiful and ruthless @entity148 , and @entity149 , all moody reticence , as a desk jockey named @entity152 with a backstory that makes it look , for a time , like he 's @entity36 's ambiguous adversary			1
together , these four execute fake seductions and underworld meetings , take parking - garage fight scenes to new heights of layer - cake suspense , and race against the clock of a nuclear countdown that 's just jittery enough to make the unthinkable credible			2
@entity162 kalls out @entity163 in latest stand - up special it 's become easy to take @entity26 's skill for granted ( even his fans do ) , but in " @entity25 " he has a pulsating presence , a dynamic mind - body fusion			1
from the moment he gets broken out of a @entity140 prison cell , only to argue with @entity85 via video feed as chaotic violence swirls all around him , @entity26 energizes the film with his no - sweat bravura			2
he kicks a * * like an ultimate - fighting bruiser , he races vehicles like a demon -- but more than any of that , he invests every line , every situation , with the cleanly intense , fired - up concentration of an actor who means it			0
powered by @entity26 's moxie , " mission : impossible -- @entity25 " proves that in a @entity192 action - ride , culture drenched in fake adrenaline , it 's cathartic to encounter the real thing			1
