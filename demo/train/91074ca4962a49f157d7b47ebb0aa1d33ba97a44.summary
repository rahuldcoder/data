-- @entity1 has never flown a manned space shuttle mission			0
there was no @entity5 rover			0
people can make their own currency			1
from february 2009 through september 2010 , someone using the name " @entity10 " made these and a series of other assertions -- unusual at best , disturbed at worst -- on the website abovetopsecret.com			1
@entity10 , according to site co-owner @entity14 , was almost certainly @entity15 , the 22 - year - old man accused of killing six people and injuring 14 others last weekend , including @entity19 rep. @entity18 , @entity20			1
the site , @entity14 said , focuses on " alternative news " and information " not covered by the mainstream media			0
" @entity14 noted that all 130 messages from @entity10 were posted from @entity15 's hometown of @entity27 , and many of them bear a striking resemblance to postings made by @entity15 on the popular social media site @entity33			1
investigators are examining the postings on @entity37 's site , according to a law enforcement source			1
the messages from @entity10 -- riddled with grammatical errors -- often became the object of ridicule , scorn or sympathy from other contributors			0
" the ranting about proof , ( your ) inability to make a coherent sentence gives you away red handed , " one person wrote			2
" it wo n't be long ( until ) you have been banned once again ! " " you sound absolutely bonkers , " added another			0
" i think you 're frankly schizophrenic , " said a third			0
" that 's not an amateur opinion and not intended as an uninformed or insulting			2
... you clearly make no sense and are unable to communicate			2
seek help before you hurt yourself or others or start taking your medications again , please			0
" @entity64 replied with a series of unrelated arguments before concluding with a brief expression of thanks for the writer 's concern			2
none of @entity10 's postings mentions @entity18 or a desire for violence , unlike language used in documents found in @entity15 's residence			1
they do , however , appear to reflect a strong urge to break free of any constraints -- real or imagined -- imposed by government officials			0
" every human who 's mentally capable is always able to be treasurer of their new currency , " he wrote at one point			1
" if the treasury creates one new currency then why could n't they create an infinite amount ? would n't ( it ) be beautiful to see your face on the new coins ? " the investigation into the postings is part of a pledge from law enforcement authorities to pursue every lead relating to saturday 's shooting			1
president @entity102 is scheduled to address mourners at a memorial service in @entity27 on wednesday night			0
