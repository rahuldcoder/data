@entity0 -- @entity4 is deep in a crowd of thousands , her cell phone camera held high overhead			1
she is streaming live video and pushing for a better shot of a protest in @entity10 , the spiritual heart of the @entity13 revolution			1
it is friday in downtown @entity0 , and people are shouting and screaming across the square , waving signs and chanting in unison			2
a fever for change pulses through the land of the @entity22			2
it is weeks after the revolution -- yet the fever here still has not broken			2
nearly every friday across much of @entity13 , crowds take to the streets , their passion and push for change still visible			1
@entity30 , a soft - spoken , petite brunette with big brown eyes , is on the lookout for human rights abuses or beatings of protesters -- her specialty and personal crusade			1
before the day is over , she will send dozens of tweets , post online pictures and video , and record her observations and interviews with people in the streets			2
and this is not even her day job			2
@entity30 is a cancer research lab worker			1
but she is also a blogger and internet activist , one of @entity13 's many prominent internet revolutionaries who helped topple former @entity13 president @entity53 in february			1
though their revolution is officially over , they consider the fight ongoing and any sort of real democracy but a far - off dream			2
they continue to tweet and upload photos and live - streaming video for all the world to see			2
a similar network of online bloggers and activists stretches across the entire @entity67 and @entity68 , from @entity69 in the east to @entity71 in the west , many of them friends and in constant contact with one another			1
mostly in their mid- 20s , the young i - revolutionaries have various motivations and backgrounds			1
for @entity30 , the mission is personal and , in many ways , an inherited mantle			1
she comes from a well - known and respected family of @entity13 human rights activists , dissidents and protesters who have helped shape her view of the world and prepare her and her siblings to take a place on the front lines of @entity13 's revolution , using the latest technological and digital weapons			1
she was born into the fight , literally			2
on the day of her birth , her father was in prison because of his activism			2
@entity99 is an internationally known human rights attorney in @entity0 who was arrested in 1983 and held five years for his work with the country 's socialist movement			1
during his detention , he was tortured , which he has spoken about publicly			2
after his release , he dedicated himself to fighting torture and injustice , becoming central to some of @entity13 's most celebrated human rights cases			1
a decade after he was freed , @entity30 helped found one of @entity13 's top human rights centers			1
much of his work at the @entity113 has put him in direct conflict with the @entity53 regime			2
@entity4 's mother , @entity116 , is a math professor at @entity117 who helped organize many of the country 's most important demonstrations against the @entity53 regime during the last two decades			1
at the height of the last big pro-democracy push , known in part for the " @entity124 " movement in 2005 , @entity116 was among a group of women assaulted by @entity53 thugs on the streets			2
in that attack , @entity4 's older brother , @entity129 , protected his mother by repelling blows with his arm , which was broken in the attack			1
@entity116 is widely known on the streets as brash and courageous , and has on numerous occasions faced down baton - wielding policemen with nothing but her scolding , scathing , booming voice and steely eyes			2
" she is unbelievable , " @entity4 said of her mother			1
" the joke with all of our friends is , if you see @entity116 in a protest , then you stick to her and you will be safe			2
" " people always assume , ( because ) she is a woman and she has white hair , so they want to protect her			2
but really she does n't fear anything			0
she never fears state security			0
i have one photo of her in a protest where she is literally pushing against this line of state security policemen			0
she 's amazing in this sense			1
" with their parents so involved in politics and dissent , @entity4 and her siblings grew up hearing about torture , repression , injustice and the law			1
the @entity53 dictatorship and police brutality were typical subjects of dinner - table conversation			0
@entity30 's oldest brother , @entity170 , is a computer programmer who has become one of the most widely known internet revolutionaries in @entity13			1
he and his wife , @entity175 , created the @entity13 blog aggregator site @entity177			1
shortly after the incident with his mother in 2005 , @entity129 's insightful , analytical blogs , in which he documented and analyzed the growing abuses by the @entity53 regime , captured attention			1
as his voice grew , @entity129 , too , became a threat to the regime			0
he was arrested at a demonstration in 2006 and imprisoned for some 45 days			0
@entity4 and @entity175 helped organize a successful worldwide online campaign to free @entity129			1
upon his release , he and his wife moved to @entity190 , where they continue their campaigns and criticism			0
@entity4 's younger sister , @entity195 , is also already involved in helping organize rallies and groups of young activists			1
@entity4 , the middle child , always knew this was her path			1
" i 've always known i 'll be politically active			0
it 's sort of , i do n't know , part of my heritage i guess , " she said			1
" but i needed to find my own space , " a way to make her own mark			0
" using @entity208 , using social networks , and with my phone , working on cases of military detentions , tribunals and torture -- this has become my own space			0
i 've found my own way of being part of all of this now			0
" in 2010 , as events began to heat up , leading to the revolution , @entity4 began regularly attending demonstrations and working to help the cause			1
" i actually celebrated my 25th birthday at a demonstration , in front of the ministry of prosecution			0
my friends were all there and it was very funny			0
" during the revolution , between january 25 and february 5 , when president @entity53 finally stepped down , @entity4 's entire family was together in the square , night and day			1
aunts and uncles and cousins came from afar -- one from @entity238 -- to join them			0
" we actually had our first family reunion in a long time in @entity10 , during the revolution , " @entity4 said			1
facing down the @entity53 regime is something she will never forget			0
" it was a life - changing moment for most of the people in @entity10			0
you could see the gunshots at people , and you could see how people were just going to face the thugs that were attacking us , with nothing to protect themselves			0
... " this was the important moment when everyone realized that everyone in @entity10 is willing to take this to the end , no matter what			0
from that moment on , for me and a lot of others , we had this blind faith that we really will win in the end			0
" today , @entity4 's main political focus is on individuals who have been detained by the military and are denied due process or fair representation			1
many detainees have been held with virtually no legal representation , she said , and many of the trials of protesters by the military have been conducted en masse			1
" we have evidence that the military right now is targeting protesters			0
... they selected known figures of the @entity10 protest			0
they selected people who were known and they tortured and beat them up , " she said			0
" and if you read or listen to the testimonies of those who were released , which are a few , we still have a lot of people detained unconstitutionally			0
and you see that it 's not just that they 're getting tortured or beaten up , but there 's an element of the @entity298 trying to break the revolutionary spirit			2
" @entity1 's request for an interview with the @entity13 military leaders was denied			1
@entity1 was instead given a statement denying these allegations			0
" these cases of torture are false rumors			0
none of these accounts are true			0
we are in unstable times in @entity13			1
there are thugs loose , " said the statement from the @entity13 military spokesman			1
@entity4 said the military used different tactics against male revolutionaries than they did the women			1
" for the guys , they said the officer told them that they wo n't stop beating them up until they say ' long live @entity53			0
' in another testimony , they told them to raise their hands up high , and when they would do this they would get beat , kicked in their faces and their heads			0
... " and for the girls , they line them up and ask them who is a virgin and who is not , and whoever says she 's a virgin , they got someone , an officer wearing a white coat , so they assume he 's a doctor , to check whether they are virgins or not with the threat that those who lied about their virginity would probably face prostitution charges			2
... you could see it was just to break their spirit			0
because in @entity13 , in this culture , nothing would break their spirits far more than this			1
" the @entity298 has admitted they did the virginity tests , saying it was a way to prevent women from making false claims of rape while they were in prison			0
@entity4 works closely with many other online activists , including her friends @entity362 and @entity364			1
they say the number of those who have been denied justice is not small			0
" when we started following some of the cases of the protesters , we realized that since january 28 there are thousands of @entity13 citizens who have gone through this			1
... they try at least 100 people per one trial			0
they do n't care about investigations ; they do n't care about the presence of a lawyer			0
so far we have 500 names of people who were tried before a military court			0
" the detainees who get released are asked to record what happened to them			2
" they write it down			0
some of them we managed to get their video testimonies right after they were released , so it actually shows bruises and burn marks			0
" the testimonies are now online , as a common blog , called the @entity397			0
" especially with the army violations and the army torture cases , " she said , " the @entity398 is really our only means of fighting this			0
" @entity1 's @entity404 and @entity405 contributed to this report .			2
