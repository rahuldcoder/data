-- on monday the @entity1 in the @entity2 ruled that @entity4 's " scientific " whale - hunting was baloney			1
it ordered @entity4 to revoke its " scientific research " permits to all its ships , effectively tying @entity4 's fleet to the dock and silencing the cannons and exploding bombs that are the way whales die nowadays			1
@entity4 says it will abide			1
i wish it would take this opportunity to bow gracefully out of something so dishonest and unfit for modernity			0
but i expect a fragile truce , and only a partial one			0
that 's because @entity4 has a history of creatively bending the rules beyond the breaking point of international intent			1
authorities and whalers seem committed to killing whales first and finding a rationale second , and it would be no surprise if the program were tweaked in some meaningless way so they could excuse continued hunting			1
or they might say the court 's ruling applies only in @entity39 waters and not the @entity40 , where they also hunt			2
or they might simply ignore the ban like their suppliers @entity44 and @entity47			2
come with me to three faraway places and you might see why i feel deeply and strongly about whales			2
during the week it takes us to circle the ice - crowned @entity54 island of @entity56 , we see exactly two large whales -- and two now - defunct whaling stations			1
in 1904 , the @entity44 whaler @entity60 arrived right here and wrote with astonishment , " i see them in hundreds and thousands			0
" during the next 60 years , whalers killed about 2 million whales in the @entity67 , including about 360,000 blue whales , 200,000 humpbacks , almost 400,000 sperm whales , and a staggering 750,000 fin whales			2
many of those whales should still be alive			2
that 's why we have n't seen more whales			1
down along the @entity76 on a penguin - research expedition , we find that the beach at @entity79 is strewn with bigger - than - dinosaur bones of great whales , cast off after the whales were stripped of flesh			1
a whale vertebrae the size of a hassock makes a good seat for jotting a few notes			2
then , like children making up a game , we 'll try to walk a couple hundred yards on the bones of whales killed by human beings , without stepping on the sand			2
it 's quite do - able			1
one skull -- a blue whale -- measures 12 feet across , eye to eye			2
@entity102 , from tip - of - jaw to back - of - skull , we pace it out at 27 boot - lengths			0
the jawbone is so big around that it comes up past our knees			0
we look at each other , then glance seaward , knowing that the now - silent bay should be spouting whales			1
next to the far north			0
in the @entity112 's @entity111 islands north of @entity44 , we have come to observe the accelerated melting of glaciers , and we find abandoned whalers ' shacks and more whale bones on the beach			1
these bowheads , killed by the tens of thousands , barely cling to existence in the @entity121			0
in 1993 , two stone harpoon points were found inside an @entity124 bowhead			0
it had been harpooned by 19th century hunters still living in the @entity127			0
industrial - age @entity128 finally got it			0
in chemical analyses of @entity124 bowheads , the oldest whale was deemed 211 years old at its death			0
it had been gliding through icy seas when @entity136 was president			0
what @entity137 in @entity138 called " so remorseless a havoc " still resonates in the wide silences of polar seas			0
most large whale populations remain depressed			0
there 's no humane way to kill a whale			2
and at roughly 10 times the price of chicken , no people will starve if they do n't eat whale meat			2
an elderly @entity152 woman once offered me a few pieces of bowhead blubber after inviting me into her home			0
it really warmed me , and was surprisingly bland - tasting			0
but the whale needed it more than i did			0
@entity160 and @entity161 had argued that @entity4 was abusing a loophole allowing lethal scientific research within the worldwide commercial whaling ban			1
( @entity44 and @entity47 ignore the ban )			0
@entity4 has been killing protected species and hunting in an internationally declared @entity39 whale sanctuary			1
the international agreement banning commercial whaling allows whale killing " for the purposes of scientific research			1
" the court found that @entity4 was doing " research , " but that the whole program was commercial whaling wrapped in a research shroud			1
in 2012 , @entity4 's @entity179 director explained that @entity180 ( rhymes with " kinky " ) whale meat is , " prized because it is said to have a very good flavor and aroma when eaten as sashimi and the like			1
" he added that , " the scientific whaling program ... was necessary to achieve a stable supply of minke whale meat			1
" in other words , the program is not " for the purpose " of scientific research			2
the court busted @entity4 on that			2
as for the quality of the research , the court noted with understatement , " @entity4 points to only two peer - reviewed papers ... since 2005 and has involved the killing of about 3,600 minke whales , ( thus ) the scientific output to date appears limited			1
" at my university , a science professor who published two papers would be terminated by year six			0
basically , the court affirmed what was always obvious : @entity4 's research was bogus			1
( part of the research is " to determine pregnancy rates " by seeing if they 're pregnant at the time of death			0
) and although it 's for commercial purposes , it loses money and is publicly subsidized			0
@entity4 compares killing whales with @entity218 killing cows			1
@entity220 try , but @entity4 's own laws on killing cows require swift and humane killing			1
it would be illegal in @entity4 to kill cows the way they kill whales			1
sure , whaling is part of @entity4 culture : it 's part of @entity233 culture too			1
there are plenty of old - style harpoons on the walls of @entity240 restaurants			0
that 's a good place for them			0
it 's time for @entity4 to update its strange commitment to cruel and useless whale killing			1
much of the world is more interested in whales than ever			0
we 've just gotten beyond killing , into real research , and gained better appreciation and understanding			0
so i am happy with the ruling that will at least hit the pause button on @entity4 's incomprehensibly outmoded whale hunts			1
@entity4 embraces @entity257 influences ranging from baseball to jazz , business suits , trains , and tobacco			2
@entity263 makes samurai cars that harken to an older culture , not samurai swords that cling to it			0
it 's time for @entity4 to come into the 21st century and hang up the whaling			1

@entity1 ruled @entity4 's " scientific " whale - hunting was baloney and it must stop
@entity273 : @entity4 ducks ban on whaling with " research ' excuse : @entity1 agrees it 's for meat
@entity273 : using cannon and bombs , whaling empties oceans once *teeming* with whales
he says arguing whaling is @entity4 culture is no excuse : it 's @entity233 culture too
