in late 1989 the carefully constructed edifice of communism in @entity2 started crumbling in a wave of popular upheavals with a speed that took everyone by surprise			1
nowhere was this process bolder and bloodier that in the final act of the revolutionary domino : the downfall of @entity13 , the @entity14 dictator who ran his country for the benefit of himself and his family like a feudal master			1
today , the country is still trying to cope with a legacy that defiled the face of @entity22 , bankrupted the state and traumatized generations of @entity14			1
for some , one way of overcoming their psychological damage is to tell their story to tourists			2
it 's now possible to join a tour in @entity22 that awakens the memories from a despised era to recount the story of the last days of @entity14 communism			1
monument to megalomania the tour starts at the grandiose @entity39 , a permanent reminder of the communist leader 's megalomania			1
@entity43 , 30 , a chic parliamentary aide , gives us the figures and numbers			2
the building , she says , is the world 's third largest by volume after the @entity51 pyramid of @entity52 and the @entity54 rocket assembly hangar			1
it uses 220,000 square meters of carpet , 3,500 tons of crystal and one million cubic meters of marble			2
the carpet in the main @entity60 alone weighs 1.5 tons			2
how did this monster come to be ? @entity43 tells us how @entity13 took advantage of a 1977 earthquake to raze most of the lower city center of @entity22 , flattening a hill and changing the course of the @entity69 river			1
forty thousand people were forcibly displaced			2
" everything within an area of four square miles was rebuilt from scratch to match the style of the @entity76			2
a stadium , several hospitals and two dozen churches or synagogues were demolished , " says @entity43			2
" only three historic @entity82 churches were saved by moving them , foundations and all , behind large apartment blocks so that they would remain invisible and not spoil his view			2
" perfect echo construction involved 700 architects and 20,000 building workers doing three shifts a day , plus 5,000 army personnel , 1.5 million factory workers and an army of so - called volunteers			1
the palace 's @entity96 features two large spiral staircases that descend to the main entrance to allow @entity13 and his wife @entity100 to make grand , synchronized entrances			1
" he was short and touchy about his height " , says @entity43 , " so he had the staircases rebuilt twice in order to match his step			2
" @entity43 claps her hands			2
" every chamber has a perfect echo , because when @entity13 wanted something , he clapped			1
and he wanted everyone to know he 'd clapped			2
" @entity13 never got to see the building finished			1
by the time of the revolution , in december 1989 , the building was only two - thirds complete			1
the incoming administration did n't know what to do with it , but the @entity14 economy was so entangled with the palace that it had to be finished			1
the building was completed in 1994 and , since 1996 , it has housed the @entity125 and @entity126			1
the ground floor is home to a modern art museum			2
nevertheless , the building , which costs a dizzying $ 6 million a year to run , is still 70 % empty			1
after one hour of walking up and down its corridors , i had still only seen less than 10 % of it			1
night of terror after this grand - scale folly , the simple , modernist design of the old @entity138 headquarters , now the @entity139 , looks mundane , banal even			2
it stands in front of what is now dubbed @entity144 , where the protesting crowds gathered in december 1989 , intent on bringing down the regime			1
my friend @entity148 has brought me here to remember that night			2
" i was just 17 , " says @entity148 , trying to sound neutral , but in his voice the underlying emotion is easily discernible			0
" i felt a change in the air			0
so on december 21 , 1989 , i came here with my friends			1
we stood here for hours , sometimes silent , sometimes shouting slogans against the regime			1
then someone started shooting at the crowd			0
" he looks up to the balcony			0
" the guy standing next to me just fell without a sound			0
he was shot in the head			0
i thought , my @entity166 , that could be me ! but i stayed			0
everyone encouraged each other and we did not go home			0
" @entity148 looks at me and guesses my thoughts			0
" i do not consider myself a hero " , he says			0
" i was just a curious boy			0
" @entity144 is now adorned with the @entity173			0
it depicts " a tall needle pricking the cloud of communism			0
" on the south side there is a @entity180 with 1,058 names of innocent @entity14 who were killed during the rebellion			1
@entity148 still does n't the name of the guy shot next to him			0
" but i know he 's one of them " , he says			1
next day , @entity13 left the besieged @entity138 hq by helicopter			1
after the army turned against him , he was arrested in @entity191 and , after a short court martial , executed along with his wife @entity100 on christmas day 1989			1
images of their dead bodies ghoulishly beamed around the world			1
an empty grave they were buried in a hurry at @entity200 in southwestern @entity22 , their graves unmarked , although everybody knew where they were			1
@entity148 shows me the original plots , now empty -- no one wants to reuse them			1
in 2010 , @entity209 , their only surviving child , received permission to have his parents ' remains exhumed and reburied together under a modest tombstone			0
" so what happened to the @entity13 's villa ? " i ask @entity148			1
" i 'll take you there " , he says and drives me to north @entity22 , where green parks , tree - lined avenues and high walls illustrate the affluence of the residents			0
@entity148 stops on the one side of a dual carriageway and points at a building on the far side			1
" that 's it " , he says with an ironic smile			2
i read the sign : " @entity230			0
" i cross the road and try to take a picture			0
there are two armed guards outside the embassy			0
" no photos , " shouts one			0
i show him my press card			0
while he looks at it , i try to steal a few quick snaps			0
" no , no , no , " shouts the second guard running towards me			0
i smile , shrug and scamper across the carriageway to @entity148 who has been watching the scene with alarm			0
" you do n't argue with police " , he says , as he speeds off , shaking his index finger at me			0
@entity13 and communism may have gone , but their impact in people 's minds will take some time to heal			1
getting there @entity22 airport is connected directly with most @entity257 capitals			0
the @entity259 agency offers a guided tour " @entity261			0
" @entity262 9:30 -- 13:30 , $ 50pp			0
( 9 @entity263 / 2 @entity22 ; +40 21 232 03 31 ; reservations@travelmaker.ro ) you can visit the @entity265 ( @entity266 2 - 4 +40 21 316 0300 ) daily 10am - 4pm , $ 10 , as an individual by prior arrangement			0
