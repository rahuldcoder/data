@entity0 -- a growing number of @entity5 's @entity4 neighbors , including its closest allies @entity7 and @entity8 , are calling on the embattled and defiant @entity10 regime to implement reforms			1
the chorus of foreign criticism and concern comes as opposition demonstrators inside @entity5 have begun for the first time making public appeals for foreign " protection			1
" in an amateur video believed to have been filmed over the weekend in the southern town of @entity21 , a crowd of dozens of young @entity5 clapped and chanted " the people demand international protection			2
" in another video , also posted on @entity27 this weekend , activsts held up printed signs saying " we need international protection , " in @entity30 and @entity31			0
this is a dramatic departure from the position demonstrators staked out during more than five months of protests against the government of @entity5 president @entity36			1
previously , activists rejected the possibility of any foreign military intervention similar to the @entity41 bombing campaign of @entity42			0
but inside @entity5 , there are signs that the opposition movement has grown frustrated with the high death toll resulting from a brutal government crackdown			2
according to the @entity49 , more than 2200 people have been killed during the uprising , in addition to mass arrests and allegations of torture by @entity5 security forces			2
in the video recorded in @entity21 , some @entity5 held up signs saying " yes to @entity58 deterrent forces			2
" activists tell @entity1 , on condition of anonymity to protect from persecution , there is more debate in opposition circles about new measures ranging from requesting a foreign military " no fly zone " over @entity5 to trying to arm protesters with weapons			2
" in an unprecedented move over the past several days , @entity5 in @entity5 and abroad have been calling for @entity5 to take up arms , or for international military intervention , " announced a prominent @entity5 opposition group , the @entity70 in @entity5 , in an e-mailed statement on monday			0
" while we understand the motivation to take up arms or call for military intervention , we specifically reject this position as we find it unacceptable politically , nationally , and ethically , " the @entity70 went on to say , arguing that militarization would " erode the morale superiority " of the @entity5 revolution			0
as frustrated protesters contemplate alternative options , @entity83 and the @entity58 league have stepped up their criticism of the @entity36 regime			1
@entity83 president @entity89 blasted his @entity5 counterpart in remarks that were televised on sunday , saying that @entity93 had " lost confidence " in its former ally and trading partner			1
" we have reached a point where anything would be too little , too late			2
we have lost our confidence , " @entity89 said			0
he noted that according to @entity83 intelligence reports , at least 17 people had been killed in a single day last thursday			0
" there is no place for totalitarian regimes and one party governments			0
clearly , the leaders of these countries will take the initiative or they will be changed by force , " @entity89 added			0
those sentiments have been echoed in recent days by @entity83 's foreign minister as well as by prime minister @entity111 , who suggested that if @entity36 continued his current policy , he would go the way of the dictators who have been overthrown in @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity42			1
on saturday , the @entity117 publicly called for restraint and an end to the violence in @entity5 , while also requesting the group 's secretary general depart on an urgent mission to @entity10			2
@entity5 's ambassador to the @entity117 rejected criticism of the @entity5 armed forces			1
according to @entity129 , @entity5 's state news agency , ambassador @entity128 repeated the government 's claim that the protesters were " armed terrorist groups " that were " receiving foreign aid			1
" @entity128 also insisted that @entity5 had embarked on a reform process to meet the demands of its citizens			0
on sunday , for example , @entity36 announced the creation of a new media law which promised to respect freedom of expression and defend journalists ' right to " analyze and comment on information			0
" but even @entity36 's closest allies , @entity7 and the @entity148 shi'ite movement @entity8 have suggested @entity10 needs to do more to meet the demands of the protest movement			1
in comments published by the semi-official @entity153 on saturday , the @entity7 foreign minister repeated @entity155 's unwavering support for @entity10 , while also urging the @entity5 government to be more cautious and patient in its dealings with the citizenry			1
meanwhile , @entity8 leader @entity160 applauded @entity5 's support for anti-israeli resistance movements in @entity148 and the occupied @entity163			1
but in a statement published by @entity8 's @entity165 , @entity160 also appealed for calm in @entity5 , and warned that " international pressure " was delaying much - needed reforms			2
" the most important thing is the fact that the @entity83 , the @entity7 and @entity8 as well as the @entity117 are sending a really strong signal that things are very serious in @entity5 and on the edge of falling apart , " said @entity169 , a widely - read @entity148 columnist and director of the @entity171 at the @entity172			1
" the @entity7 and @entity8 are looking at @entity36 's choices thus far and drawing the same conclusion we are : this guy 's panicking and his decisions indicate incompetence and also moodiness which is a hallmark of @entity36 's reign , " said @entity178 , author of the soon - to - be - published " in the @entity179 : an eyewitness account of @entity191 's @entity190 with @entity5			1
" " their interaction with @entity36 is probably the same as ours , its paradoxical			0
he promises not to use live fire and then uses live fire			0
" " they [ @entity7 and @entity8 ] are the two closest allies of @entity5 , " @entity169 added			1
" it 's an important message of support and also a warning			0
a warning that if things keep going bad its going to be bad for everyone			0
" even @entity205 , a long - time supplier of weapons to the @entity10 regime , appears to be worried			0
a high - ranking @entity205 diplomat delivered a letter from @entity205 president @entity212 to @entity36 on monday , the @entity209 announced on its web - site			2
the @entity205 envoys appealed for an immediate end to violence from all sides in @entity5 , while also urging the @entity5 government to immediately begin concrete moves towards implementing reforms			1
despite the @entity5 president 's repeated promises to end single - party rule and lift the four - decade long state of emergency in his country , there were widespread reports that the @entity5 military was continuing its deadly crackdown on opposition activists			1
the @entity231 reported at least five people were killed and more than 60 wounded when @entity5 troops stormed the town of @entity235 in the northwest of the country on monday			0
