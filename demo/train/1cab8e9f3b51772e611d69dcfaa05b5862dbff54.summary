we will not know for some time exactly why three men who were arrested on wednesday in the @entity3 wanted to join @entity4 in @entity5			1
but what we do know is that it has become common , even routine , to argue that there exists a process by which potential terrorists become " radicalized			0
" the concept , which has become something of a buzzword , suggests that the central motivation for terrorist violence is ideological			1
however , @entity17 terrorists in the @entity18 have generally been set off not so much by anything theoretical but rather by intense outrage at @entity3 and @entity22 actions in the @entity23 and by a burning desire to seek revenge , to get back , to defend , and / or to make a violent statement expressing their hostility to what they see as a war on @entity32			1
this can be seen in the story of one of the shooters in the @entity38 attack in @entity39			0
if he was " radicalized " by anything , it was by news about the way prisoners were being treated by the @entity3 at @entity45 in @entity46			1
he spent years trying to get to @entity46 to fight the @entity3 there , finally finding a target closer to home			1
the same observation arises when one looks over a collection of case studies of terrorists or would - be terrorists who have sought to do damage in the @entity3			1
the overwhelming driving force in these cases has been simmering , and more commonly boiling , outrage at @entity3 foreign policy			1
it was not that the plotters in these cases were motivated solely by a coherent ideology or had a burning urge to spread @entity32 and @entity65 law or to establish caliphates			0
rather , it was the desire to protect their religion against what they perceived to be a concentrated war upon it in the @entity23 by the @entity3 government and military			1
at the same time , these cases -- from the shoe - bomber to the underwear bomber -- show that there is remarkably little hostility to @entity3 culture or society			2
for example , the infamous @entity84 bomber , a @entity85 who tried to blow up a car in @entity87 , specifically mentioned @entity3 drone strikes that killed civilians in @entity91			2
the @entity93 bombers , similarly , explicitly cited the @entity3 wars in @entity46 and @entity95 as motivating factors			2
almost none of the terrorists or would be terrorists had any problem with @entity3 society itself			2
this is particularly impressive because many of them ( though certainly not all ) were misfits , suffered from personal identity crises , were friendless , came from broken homes , were often desperate for money , had difficulty holding jobs , were on drugs , were petty criminals , experienced various forms of discrimination , and were , to use a word that pops up in quite a few of the case studies and fits even more of them , " losers			0
" as terrorism specialist and former @entity121 officer @entity119 points out , " radicalization " principally happens because of perceived injustice against one 's group -- a perspective the @entity127 's @entity126 finds " worth a careful look , " but calls " contrarian			0
" the standard " radicalization " misdirection process can be seen in a @entity133 case in 2011 in which two men were picked up for planning to shoot a machine gun and lob grenades at a local military processing center			0
according to news reports , the perpetrators said that they were motivated by a desire to retaliate for crimes by @entity3 soldiers in @entity95 and that they wanted to kill military personnel to prevent them from going to @entity32 lands to kill @entity146			2
the official @entity148 press release on the case , however , merely says that the men were " driven by a violent , extreme ideology			0
" similarly a former @entity152 counterterrorism analyst was asked recently on @entity153 about why people are drawn to violent extremism			0
he stressed that there are " ideological issues " as well as " local grievances " including " access to education and job opportunities " and whether one feels that one is fully accepted in society			0
outrage at @entity3 actions in the @entity23 scarcely entered the discussion			1
speakers at the recent @entity169 summit on countering violent extremism typically found some of the " root causes " of terrorism to lie in ideology , the ministrations of propagandists , the influence of the @entity175 , poverty , inadequate job opportunities and alienation from society			0
those may well be contributing factors , but perhaps the most prominent motivating force is anger at @entity3 foreign policy .			1

@entity186 : it 's assumed that the central motivation for terrorist violence is ideological
he says for those who become radical , boiling outrage at @entity3 foreign policy is the driving force
