-- tuesday night 's tight contest for the top spot in the @entity5 @entity4 caucuses reflects the ongoing tension that exists within the @entity4			1
this struggle between the conservative religious voters -- whose voice is strong and loud in @entity5 and was represented by @entity10 -- and the more moderate , mainstream voters , represented by @entity12 , is indicative of a fight for the soul of the @entity4			1
what is so interesting is that four years ago , @entity12 's 25 % share of the vote was not nearly enough to give him the victory			2
but this year , that same 25 % is enough to keep him alive			0
while his campaign will spin that he was not really playing in @entity5 , he can not be totally happy , because the @entity5 results can not be read as anything than a continued rejection of @entity12 by conservative @entity4 voters			1
regardless , as long as the anybody - but - @entity12 vote is split among several candidates , and the longer most of them stay in the race , the better it is for @entity12 -- who can thereby win primaries with far less than a majority			2
social conservatives made very clear in @entity5 that it was important for them to take a stand and vote for someone they could feel good about -- someone who in their hearts and consciences they could wholeheartedly defend -- rather than give their votes to someone they did not like and did not trust			1
again , this is not good news for @entity12			2
he is like the bitter pill that conservatives refuse to take as long as there is still a viable alternative			0
it also indicates that @entity12 still has an uphill battle to convince the majority of @entity4 voters that he is the one who can fully represent core conservative values and principles			2
he was not able to make the sale in @entity5			1
will he be able to make it in upcoming states where conservatives also have an important voice ? @entity12 has made a career of changing his stances to match the prevailing political winds			1
in 2008 , that lack of core political values cost him the nomination			0
are @entity4 desperate enough this time around to support someone who has marketed himself as perhaps not the perfect conservative , but at least the best bet against @entity72 ? if that is the case , the problem for @entity12 will be that general election voters will see right through this farce , even as conservative @entity4 voters have here in @entity5			1
he will have a tough time making the case that he is the best candidate on the economy , since when he was governor of @entity84 , his state was the third - worst in the country on job creation			0
when he was head of @entity87 , he destroyed more @entity89 jobs than he created , while making millions for his investors -- just ask @entity91 , a factory worker who was laid off because @entity87 closed the factory where he worked			0
@entity12 has also moved so far to the right on other critical issues that it will be hard for him to reconcile those positions with those of more mainstream general election voters			1
and what about the importance of @entity102 voters ? let 's not forget that no @entity4 candidate will see the inside of " @entity106 " without at least 40 % of the @entity102 vote , according to @entity109 pollster @entity108			0
no @entity4 candidate even bothered to visit the @entity102 - rich population towns in @entity5 , and @entity12 has already declared he would veto the @entity112 if he becomes president			1
so let 's be clear -- the @entity4 can say goodbye to the @entity102 vote in the general election			2
this overall tension within the @entity4 between the mainstream and the extreme was in full display tuesday night in @entity5			0
as such , the biggest winner of the @entity5 caucuses by far is @entity72			0
as i saw someone tweet tuesday night -- somewhere in @entity5 , the @entity72 campaign is smiling			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity129 .			0

@entity12 and @entity10 virtually tied for first place in @entity5
@entity129 says the contest shows @entity12 ca *n't* make the sale to conservatives
she says he has *swung* right to win their votes , which would hurt him in general election
