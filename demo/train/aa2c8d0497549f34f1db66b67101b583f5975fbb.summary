@entity0 -- @entity2 has put in place safety systems for offshore drilling that are ahead of any other company 's , the @entity7 oil group has said as it prepares for the trial over the 2010 @entity10 disaster			1
the company has set out for the first time details of how it has restructured its operations and invested in new technology in an attempt to show that the mistakes that led to the fatal explosion and huge oil spill in the @entity20 will not be repeated			1
@entity21 , who is about to take over as president of the company 's operations in the @entity20 , said changes brought in since the disaster represented a greater investment in safety than for any of @entity2 's competitors , and were " laying the foundations for a very safe company "			1
@entity2 's new safety procedures will have no direct bearing on the civil trial over the spill , which is scheduled to start on february 25			2
however , the company has been talking about what it sees as profound changes in its practices in order to improve its image in the @entity43 , and with other governments and companies worldwide			0
mr @entity21 highlighted changes such as a new unit in @entity48 focused on monitoring wells being drilled offshore to watch for signs of trouble : a function that he said had no parallel in other companies			1
@entity2 is also setting up its own training facility to teach engineers and supervisors how to manage possible leaks of oil and gas of the kind that caused the @entity10 disaster , which an instructor described as aiming to be " the @entity64 of well control "			1
@entity2 is now more active in the @entity20 than ever , with seven rigs drilling wells , and was the region 's largest producer of oil and gas last year			1
facing challenges in other parts of the world , and having sold its @entity76 joint venture @entity2 , it sees the @entity43 as central to its plans for future growth			0
however , the aftermath of the @entity10 still overshadows the company 's prospects			2
in its settlement last year with the @entity43 @entity83 of the criminal charges against it , @entity2 admitted that negligence on the part of its employees -- along with other companies -- was a " proximate cause " of the accident			2
that led to debarment from new federal contracts , which means that @entity2 can not take out any new drilling leases in the gulf until the ban is lifted			0
the @entity83 said last year in a memo filed to the court in @entity100 hearing the civil case over the spill that it planned to prove @entity2 had acted with " gross negligence or wilful misconduct " that had caused the accident			1
@entity2 denies this gross negligence			2
the @entity10 disaster followed other failures including a leak from a pipeline in @entity110 in 2006 and the @entity111 in 2005 , which killed 15 people in one of the @entity43 's worst industrial accidents of recent years			0
after those accidents @entity115 , who took over as chief executive in 2007 , promised to restructure the company to focus on safety " like a laser "			0
mr @entity21 said the company had been pushing ahead with those changes , which had not been fully implemented at the time of the @entity10 accident , and introducing new systems and technologies as a result of the lessons it had learnt from its investigation of the disaster			0
for example , he said staff of @entity2 's new safety and operational risk organisation , set up by mr @entity115 's successor @entity136 in 2011 , now had the authority to order that an operation be stopped , when the previous safety body had more of an advisory role			0
another change was that the importance of process safety -- focusing on an operation as a whole , rather than small individual accidents -- was one of the lessons of the @entity150 disaster and has now been emphasised in the drilling operations as well as @entity2 's refineries , mr @entity21 said			0
