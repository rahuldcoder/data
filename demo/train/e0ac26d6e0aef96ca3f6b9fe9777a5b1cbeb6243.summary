-- last week , the @entity1 gave us an inside look at what it 's like to work at @entity7 , the manufacturing company that owns several @entity9 - based factories that crank out @entity11 's @entity10 , iphones and ipods by the millions			1
the story is full of examples of horrifying working conditions in @entity7 's factories that would never fly here in the @entity19			1
here are some of the more troubling ones from the @entity1 story : @entity7 is a 24 - hour operation			1
employees work six days a week , sometimes in 12 - hour shifts			0
they 're on their feet for so long that their legs begin to swell			0
they live in crowded dorms on the factory 's campus			0
in recent years , there have been reports of workers leaping from buildings in apparent suicides			0
the story even describes the gruesome death of one @entity7 worker after an explosion in a facility that made @entity10 in @entity43 , @entity9			1
the worker 's " skin was almost completely burned away " by the blast , the @entity1 reports			2
he died a few days later with his family by his side			0
@entity7 denies the reports that working conditions are like what the @entity1 describes			1
@entity11 refuses to comment on the record , but a leaked e-mail from ceo @entity55 to all @entity11 employees says the company is committed to worker safety and that it takes all those claims very seriously			2
so knowing all that , should we be concerned about where our iphones and other gadgets come from and how they 're made ? or is the human cost so far removed from us here in the @entity19 that we 're willing to look over it in favor of whatever fancy new touchscreen gadget @entity11 releases next ? the issue even has some people throwing around the idea of a boycott			1
one effort , hosted on the website @entity75 , has collected more than 145,000 signatures from people calling on @entity11 to better protect its workers			1
while those efforts sound noble , there 's no way boycotting @entity11 gadgets will actually work			2
let 's start with why people keep snapping up @entity11 's iphones and @entity10 by the millions each week in the first place			1
when it comes to smartphones and tablets , @entity11 still makes the best there are			2
with the @entity91 and the @entity10 , the company set a new standard that other tech giants such as @entity94 and @entity95 are still struggling to imitate			0
@entity11 ca n't make them fast enough			2
on launch days , people queue up in massive lines so they can be one of the first to get a new @entity91 or @entity10			0
even if consumers do know about what it took to make their new gadget , as many likely do thanks to the widespread reports on working conditions overseas , it 's obviously not enough to keep them from getting caught up in the fervor of an @entity11 product launch			1
i ca n't see that ending just because of a new story in the @entity1 or a proposed boycott			1
but it 's not just about the massive popularity of @entity11 's gadgets that keep people buying			1
the latest and greatest @entity91 model , the @entity120 , costs $ 199			0
ipads start at $ 499			0
one of the biggest reasons @entity11 can sell its stuff at such low prices is because they 're produced on the cheap in @entity9 , sometimes by sacrificing good working conditions to make it happen			1
( if you believe the reports			0
) those cheap production costs are why a lot of the anger comes from the fact that @entity11 is a massively profitable company			2
right now it has almost $ 100 billion sitting in the bank			0
it could use some of that cash to put more pressure on @entity7 and others to improve working conditions overseas			1
a successful boycott could force @entity11 to make those changes , but consumers will have to sacrifice something , too			1
in a poll from the @entity1 that ran with its @entity7 story last week , most consumers thought companies such as @entity11 should make products in the @entity19 but still absorb the added manufacturing costs			1
in other words , consumers do n't want to pay more for iphones and @entity10 than they already do just to ensure factory workers get better working conditions			1
it 's all about money			0
so even if @entity11 moved production to the @entity19 or managed to heavily invest in @entity9 and improve working conditions there , it would likely result in higher prices for consumers			1
for a profit - driven company such as @entity11 , there 's almost no chance it would want to absorb those costs itself			2
yes , a lot of the heat on this issue has been put on @entity11			2
but keep in mind it 's not alone			0
@entity7 and similar manufacturers in @entity168 make gadgets for several other major consumer brands			0
it 's not like suddenly switching from the @entity91 to another smartphone will improve the lives of those who make it			0
you may feel guilty buying an @entity11 product , but the problem wo n't be fixed until all electronics makers change , too			2
in the end , consumers would be the ones who have to pay to make working conditions better for the people who make your @entity91			1
and it seems unlikely there are enough of you out there willing to do that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192			0
