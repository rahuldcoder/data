@entity0 -- defense secretary @entity2 says he will urge president @entity3 to veto a coming $ 726 billion defense authorization bill if it contains funding for unwanted projects @entity2 has been trying to cut for years			1
@entity2 has been vocal about financial reform at the @entity8 , trying to rein in some big - ticket contracts and telling @entity10 to stop spending money on c - 17 transport planes that are not needed and a $ 485 million alternate engine for the @entity14 ( @entity14 )			1
the @entity14 engine program -- already delayed and over budget -- could end up costing taxpayers billions of dollars , according to @entity2			0
but with jobs at stake , @entity10 has ignored those requests for years and continued to appropriate funds for the @entity22 and a second f - 35 engine			2
" the detailed conditions they [ @entity10 ] have imposed on the overall @entity14 program would make it essentially un-executable and impose unacceptable schedule and budget costs , " @entity2 said thursday at a @entity8 briefing			2
" as i have stated repeatedly , should the @entity10 insist on adding funding for a costly and unnecessary @entity14 extra engine or direct changes that seriously disrupt the @entity14 program , or impose additional c - 17 aircraft , i will strongly recommend that the president veto such legislation , " he said			1
the @entity8 believes the proposal for the new engine , made by @entity40 , would end up costing about $ 2.9 billion which includes re-working the engine already being tested because there is concern it does not meet the performance needs for the @entity14			0
those costs would be picked up by taxpayer dollars , according to @entity8 estimates			0
additionally the contract for the new proposal by @entity10 would require cutting the purchase of the current engine by half to let the @entity40 engine purchase catch up , according to @entity2			1
" only in @entity0 does a proposal where everybody wins get considered a competition , where everybody is guaranteed a piece of the action at the end , " @entity2 said			0
" yes , we 're in favor of competition , but my idea of competition is winner takes all , and we do n't have that kind of a situation here , " he continued			0
the @entity71 passed the bill wednesday			0
the bill must be approved by the entire @entity71 then matched by a @entity75 version and signed by @entity3 before becoming law .			1
