-- for a man whose previous nickname was " the @entity4 , " balance might not be thought of as one of @entity9 president @entity8 's strong points			1
promises of pragmatism and a more balanced society from the new president			1
however , speaking to @entity0 for @entity14 just a few weeks after his inauguration as president , restoring some equilibrium to @entity9 society is one of the key aims of his presidency			1
" my country has undergone rapid industrialization and development , as well as democratization , " he told @entity24			0
" and throughout this process , i believe some sort of balance has been lost			0
the gap between the haves and the have - nots has widened lately , which i believe must be rectified			2
" it 's not an unfamiliar sentiment for a politician to express , but @entity8 's journey from childhood poverty to the pinnacle of political life perhaps makes him more qualified than many politicians to relate to his electorate			1
for many of his supporters his life reflects the recent history of @entity9 itself			1
@entity8 was born in @entity49 , @entity50 in 1941 during the @entity50 occupation of the @entity9 peninsular and returned to @entity9 with his parents at the end of the @entity55			1
without any money to pay for his education , he paid his own way through university in @entity60 , at one point taking a job as a garbage collector , working during the day , while studying at night			0
as a student he led protests against the authoritarian government , receiving a caution from police in 1962			0
after graduating he took a job with @entity70			0
his hard work and ambition saw that he became its ceo after just 12 years , at the age of 36			0
it was as a dynamic young ceo , part of the new generation that was rapidly building @entity9 's industry and economy in the 1970 's and 80 's , he gained the nickname " the @entity4 " for his single - minded approach and tenacity to drive through difficult projects			1
his transition from ceo to politician came when he became mayor of @entity60 in 2002 and undertook one of the city ' most ambitious and popular programs of urban renewal			0
he was elected on the promise of transforming the city , ripping out a traffic - clogged elevated highway that ran through its center and restoring the @entity95 stream that had been covered over			2
it 's completion in 2005 led to a blooming example of the growing emphasis on quality of life in a country that had sacrificed economic and industrial growth for all else			2
it also propelled him into the international spotlight , with @entity105 naming him one of its @entity106 in 2007			1
he has not been without his detractors , however , and even after the election there were questions surrounding his ethics			0
while @entity9 has been trying to shed its image of corporate corruption , just four days before his inauguration as president he was cleared of accusations of stock manipulation			1
" during this rapid period , yes indeed , there were a lot of side effects			0
and one of them was corruption and that transparency was not prevalent in our society , " he told @entity0			0
" now that i am president , such a culture in the political culture , as well as the corporate culture , must change			2

his rags - to - *riches* story reflects recent history of @entity9
