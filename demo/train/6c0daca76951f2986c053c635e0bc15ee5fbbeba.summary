like this one from a second - grader named " @entity35 " who wrote about month ago , " i bet you are amazing			1
... i treasure you very much			1
" @entity35 , you read our minds			2
@entity23 first got our attention earlier this week when his rescue of four orphaned rabbits made the front page of @entity24			1
he introduces the story this way : " i live in @entity47 , @entity48			2
and as i was raking the volleyball court at the barracks i found a dead rabbit ( fully grown )			2
as i continued raking i found a small hole with 4 tiny tiny rabbits in it			1
i grabbed a box put a few old shirts into it and picked up the bunnies			2
i researched how to raise them and what to feed them			2
i made a nice box for them to live in a and bottle fed them until i could [ wean ] them to eat the local foods			2
after a couple months i brought them to a wildlife rescue because they were starting to jump out of their box			2
it was a lot of hard work but i loved the bunnies ...			2
" did you feel it ? did you feel your icy heart melting ? for two months he fed the little critters several times a day using an eyedropper			1
once the bunnies were big enough to begin jumping out of the box , he took them to a nearby wildlife sanctuary			0
" it was a sad day , " he said			0
" i 'm not sure what they are doing now , but i like to think they are fighting off coyotes with the sweet swords and armor i made them and living the dream in @entity95 eating the freshest of grasses and meeting all sorts of sexy girl bunnies			0
" when asked about his recent online fame he joked , " what i do n't like about it is that the fame is getting to my head			0
i have cut my friends and family off , they keep asking me for money			0
