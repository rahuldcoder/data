@entity0 , @entity1 -- as i wait in line , staring down at the notes in my @entity6 to remember the exact order for two @entity8 with cheese meals for our engineer and cameraman , i could well be in any @entity13 in the world			1
the golden arches , the familiar red signs with @entity17 staring straight at me and the menu remain the same wherever you go in the world , such is the long arm of @entity23 corporate globalization			1
this restaurant is certainly a testament to that			0
however , this is n't @entity28			2
with a couple of @entity34 sports cars parked on the curb , facing the town 's @entity36 , this particular @entity17 's is doing a roaring trade this friday lunchtime			1
@entity40 reported in @entity41 outside @entity1 it 's only two days before the region 's people will go to the ballot boxes and vote on whether to stay part of the @entity41 or join @entity40			1
the referendum will be held on sunday			0
from what we have seen here , this will be largely symbolic			0
from what we can see , the majority of @entity53 would rather look toward @entity55 than @entity56 and the white , blue and red of the @entity40 flag is already flying through these streets			1
our team was asked to come down here to the port of @entity0 after having spent a week in the heart of the @entity1 capital , @entity65 , dodging cossacks with their whips , men with more than a whiff of vodka on their breath and @entity40 soldiers sporting trendy balaclavas and @entity75			1
nestled on the @entity76 , @entity0 is a party town , prettier than the capital			1
luxury yachts are in the port side by side with @entity40 destroyers			1
there are many nightclubs and bars			0
indeed , the main square has had a concert on every night for the past seven days to celebrate returning back to the " motherland			0
" contrary to what the @entity93 foreign ministers say on their official @entity96 accounts and what the @entity97 may read out during their briefings in @entity100 , the majority of the people we have spoken with here are glad the @entity40 bear has woken up			1
and they are happy to roar with it			2
i mean , in their eyes with the amount of propaganda from billboards with swastikas over the map of @entity41 and rumors of terrorists in @entity56 , who would n't want to be @entity40 ? in their eyes , it 's either that or being a @entity116			1
the main square here fills up each lunchtime with cossacks , @entity40 flags and the local @entity123 militias with their red armbands dressed all in black			1
the music reminds me of old @entity127 propaganda films and these men in their gangs of militias remind me of my history lessons learning about the so - called " brownshirts " of @entity134 's @entity133 during the 1930s			2
the irony not lost that these men who chant " @entity141 , @entity141 , @entity141 " and call those who protested in @entity140 square fascists look very similar to those real fascists pictured in my old history books			0
any dissent here has now been stamped out			0
we have been in this town for over a week now , and i have n't seen one @entity41 flag apart from the two on the @entity41 warships blockaded in the port			1
it is far too dangerous for any @entity154 voices to speak out			0
news of abductions and kidnapping are daily here , and as we enjoyed a meal last night , we were asked to give our details to the @entity41 police officers who detained us there for just under an hour			0
they are carefully watched over by their new @entity40 boss			2
a plainclothed @entity164 ( @entity40 secret police ) officer making sure that the local police now start to monitor the movements of @entity170 journalists properly			2
an apologetic " sorry " was uttered in @entity171 after they had finished taking our passport details			0
no matter how the older generation here roar and chant the @entity40 president 's name , there is a bubble under the surface			1
the majority of young people here have grown up as @entity41 , never under the watchful eye of @entity55 , and they are n't too pleased			0
every time you ask them what they think , you just get a sigh as they say " what can we do ? " and talk of perhaps one day leaving to @entity56			0
and so the result of the referendum on sunday will go one way			0
there may be two questions posed on the ballot paper , but there is already only one answer			0
that answer being written in @entity202			0
yet monday , before we leave @entity1 and take our flights back to @entity30 , via @entity55 as all other flights to and from other destinations have been canceled , i may well pop in and grab a bite for the road			2
i am sure that i will still look around in that full restaurant and see the same @entity41 faces , paying for their meals with @entity41 currency with a @entity215 in one hand and a @entity40 flag in the other			2
legal or not , @entity1 referendum will shape country 's future @entity222 goes to @entity56 , calls for @entity23 military support			1

@entity2 's @entity225 and a crew have been in port city of @entity0
they find a *crisis* ca n't stop the lure of @entity17 's , which is doing a thriving business
from the looks of it , the residents of @entity1 are happy the @entity40 bear has *awoken*
