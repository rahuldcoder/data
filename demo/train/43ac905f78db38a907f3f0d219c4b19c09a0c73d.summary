-- patience , it is said , is a virtue			0
if that 's the case , then the scientists involved in the @entity6 's @entity5 mission have been very virtuous indeed			1
after all , the men and women involved in the project have waited most of their scientific careers -- through years of planning and construction , not to mention the 10 - year journey of the @entity5 spacecraft -- to see the @entity17 lander land on @entity18			1
and now they can enjoy the fruits of this amazing adventure , which has landed ( albeit a little bumpily ) and has been returning data			0
@entity5 was an enormously ambitious and technically risky project			1
however , overall , it has been a great success so far , with a number of " firsts " for @entity6 that have not been achieved by any other space agency -- it has chased a comet across the solar system , rendezvoused and then achieved orbit			1
landing a probe on the surface like this has been a huge challenge : working in a low gravity environment with poor knowledge of the nature of the comet surface			2
it was unclear even if it would it be a solid body or a loose collection of material			0
and there are plenty more challenges ahead			0
for a start , although data has been collected from the orbiter since august , and the first images are now being received from the lander , it will take many more months and possibly years for @entity5 to realize its full scientific legacy			1
however , even as the initial excitement over the technical success fades , we will gradually begin to understand the building blocks of the solar system			2
it is this reality that really speaks to the value of such a project			2
comets are pristine material largely unchanged since the planetary system was formed			0
it is thought that they may be the origin of most of the water found on @entity66 , and could even have brought complex organic molecules -- the potential raw material for the emergence of life -- to its surface			0
just as the @entity72 was the key to unlocking the secrets of @entity76 writing , so the @entity5 space mission will answer some of the fundamental questions about our origins			1
this potential is being unlocked not by a single - nation space agency , but one that is a collaboration of 20 countries , including @entity85 , non-eu and several former @entity88 countries			0
yet while it has just celebrated its 50th birthday , the @entity6 has often operated in the shadow of @entity91			0
for example , the media frequently talk about @entity91 's @entity94 , with little or no acknowledgment of the partnership with @entity6			0
( from a @entity99 perspective , it has therefore been particularly welcome to hear the generous acknowledgment of the @entity5 achievements by @entity91 leaders )			1
all this means that while @entity6 has had significant successes in the past , the extent of the @entity5 's success represents a timely " coming of age			1
" and , in a world that often seems to be mired in conflict , @entity5 is not just a technical and scientific success , but also a political one			1
space research is one of the best examples of peaceful international cooperation and of the ability of humans to do marvelous things when they work together towards a common goal			0
i am not the only one to have worked on several successful space projects during my career , and to have made many friends around the world as a consequence , often in countries that would have once been regarded as political rivals ( or even some that still are )			0
@entity127 , a major space power in its own right , is a great example of this -- the @entity6 and @entity127 are currently planning a first joint space science mission as the basis for future collaborations			2
and this might be the biggest lesson that we can learn from @entity5 -- that as future plans for space research and exploration missions inevitably become more ambitious ( and more expensive ) , the need for agencies to work closely together will increase			1
if they are smart and forward thinking , then politicians and governments will do what they can to enable this , because if they are successful , we might finally realize the goal of so many of us in the field of achieving truly global cooperation in space , cooperation that will benefit all of humanity .			2
