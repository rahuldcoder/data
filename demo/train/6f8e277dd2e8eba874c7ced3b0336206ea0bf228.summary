-- there was no one else like him , certainly not in our time , likely not ever			0
is this an overstatement ? put it this way : how would you ever typecast @entity10 ? gangster ? priest ? cop ? super villain ? spy ? schoolteacher ? sybarite ? @entity15 ? a president of the @entity17 ? let 's put it another way : who could you imagine doing all these things in ways that no one else had done before ? just so			1
@entity10 , who was found dead at 46 of an apparent drug overdose sunday , had at one time or another played some of those above - mentioned roles and did with an open - hearted incisiveness that unsettled presumptions and awakened possibilities			2
when @entity10 was onscreen , you knew you were going to see a kind of person who , while you may not have personally encountered in real life , you acknowledged as a plausible human being , no matter how quirky or disorienting his personality			1
whether he was playing the manipulative , abusive , but emotionally needy cult leader in 2012 's " @entity40 " ( to these eyes , his finest big - screen performance ) , a crusty , disheveled but faintly idealistic @entity43 operator in 2007 's " @entity44 " or a pampered , egocentric but observant rich boy in 1999 's " @entity46 , " @entity10 layered his technical skills with compassion , insight and sense of risk			1
those skills were not inconsiderable			0
he packed a resonant voice that could vault several octaves above its normal deep - dyed wooly tone			0
( look no further than his @entity58 - winning performance in the title role of 2005 's " @entity60			2
" ) 5 reasons we loved @entity10 he exercised a meticulous sense of detail , lightly tailored for each role , no matter how ludicrous ( " @entity70 's " grimy , wealthy and sadistic bad - guy - in - charge ) or familiar ( " @entity67 's " blustery , seen - it - all team manager )			1
his was the kind of versatility commonly associated with the character actor more than with the movie star			2
yet it was @entity10 's broad range and penetrating compassion that made him , if not a star , a reliable brand name for movies that aimed higher than commercial cinema usually bothered			1
you looked forward to seeing @entity10 's name in the credits , if only to see what kind of weirdness was in store			1
it was n't apparent at first how far and how fast @entity10 's oddly configured star would rise			1
depending on how long you 'd been going to the movies , you might have first noticed him as the petulant , trigger - happy small - town policeman in 1994 's " @entity92 " or as the swaggering , borderline - deranged craps player in 1996 's " @entity95			0
" neither of these performances prepared you for his sweet , out - of - left - field portrayal of @entity99 , a gay , grubby - puppy production assistant for a porn - movie outfit in 1997 's " @entity101			0
" after a while , the only thing you expected from @entity10 was the unexpected			2
he gave a persuasive , tender rendering in 2000 's " @entity105 " of the ill - fated rock critic @entity106 ( whose premature drug - related death , not depicted in the film , deepens the poignancy of @entity10 's own )			1
a succession of misfits , screw - ups , neurotics , thwarted dreamers and self - deluded narcissists followed offset by such complicated , intriguing characters as the tormented visionary theater director @entity118 in 2008 's " @entity119 , @entity120			0
" @entity118 is one of the few characters in @entity10 's curriculum vitae whose massive urges for sex , adulation and control are sated , but whose more cosmic yearnings remain unfulfilled			1
even when not playing someone clinging to life 's margins , @entity10 played his own worst enemy			1
perhaps that 's what endeared him to us the most , this unlikely icon of craftsmanship whose physical presence called to mind how @entity134 once described @entity136 's cartoon characters : having the " outer semblance of unbaked cookies			0
" from this loose , somewhat baggy set of physical attributes , @entity10 sculpted vivid depictions of the human heart at its most besieged and overwhelmed			2
the effort he put into these renderings showed he cared about the unlucky , the awkward and ( despite it all ) the most dauntless among us			0
is all this overstatement ? only if you can think of anyone else who will carry on in his absence			0
and i 'm stumped ... and sad			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			0

@entity160 : there was no other actor like @entity10
he did n't play a certain kind of role but had *astonishing* range , he says
@entity160 says the actor made you wonder what he would have in store
he says @entity10 's acting vividly *sketched* the lives of people who are besieged and unlucky
