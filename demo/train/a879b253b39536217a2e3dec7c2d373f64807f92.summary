@entity0 -- former vice president @entity2 on sunday said his claim that enhanced interrogation techniques -- including waterboarding -- produced critical post- 9/11 information was supported by a pair of intelligence reports released last week			1
former vp @entity2 says enhanced interrogation techniques persuaded subjects " to cooperate			1
" " the enhanced interrogation techniques were absolutely essential in saving thousands of @entity12 lives , " he told " @entity13			1
" however , the two dossiers that were declassified at @entity2 's request do not disclose what kinds of techniques were used to elicit the intelligence			1
the only method occasionally cited by the reports is a routine one -- using information from one detainee to gain details from another			2
the two reports surfaced as the latest ammunition in the debate over whether the use of controversial interrogation techniques like stress positions , wall slamming , and waterboarding -- considered torture by critics -- helped prevent terrorist attacks			1
@entity2 said the reports prove that two top @entity38 suspects , @entity39 and @entity40 , " were uncooperative at first			1
" but " the application of enhanced interrogation techniques , specifically waterboarding -- especially in the case of @entity39 -- is what really persuaded him he needed to cooperate , " @entity2 said a @entity12 government official with knowledge of the interrogation program told @entity1 that while the chronology is not spelled out in the two reports , @entity39 's information became " more voluminous and accurate " after he was exposed to waterboarding 183 times			1
the official declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the subject			0
@entity40 also talked more after being subjected to waterboarding , according to a third document -- a 2004 @entity58 inspector general 's report that was released last week			2
" it is not possible to say definitively that the waterboard is the reason for @entity40 's increased production , " says the report , " or if another factor , such as the length of detention , was the catalyst			0
since the use of the waterboard , however , @entity40 has appeared to be cooperative			0
" it also says that before his waterboarding , @entity39 provided little information			0
but the report is cautious on whether the enhanced interrogation techniques , or @entity75 , approved by the @entity77 administration helped the interrogation program get results			1
" there is no doubt the program has been effective , " the 2004 report says			0
" measuring the effect of the @entity75 , however , is a more subjective process and not without some concern			0
" the @entity58 report also does not say whether the techniques -- which have since been banned -- were the only way to get the detainees to talk			2
" the effectiveness of particular interrogation techniques in eliciting information that might not otherwise have been obtained can not be so easily measured , " it says			2
and one of @entity97 's interrogators , former @entity99 special agent @entity98 , told a @entity101 hearing in may that waterboarding him was unnecessary			0
any useful information interrogators got from him either was or could have been produced without " enhanced " techniques , he said			1
@entity98 said @entity40 stopped talking after @entity58 contractors took over and began using harsh techniques , which he testified were " ineffective , slow and unreliable , and harmful to our efforts to defeat @entity38			1
" @entity40 was subjected to waterboarding 83 times in august 2002 , according to @entity77 administration documents released in april ; @entity39 was waterboarded 183 times in march 2003 , according to the documents			0
@entity12 authorities prosecuted @entity114 officers who used waterboarding against @entity12 prisoners in @entity117 but @entity77 administration lawyers argued the tactic did not violate @entity12 laws against torture as long as interrogators had no intent to cause " severe pain			0
" @entity2 said in may that the interrogations were used only on " hardened terrorists " after other efforts failed -- and " in a few cases , that information could be gained only through tough interrogations			1
" and there was also time pressure , the @entity12 official with knowledge of the interrogation program told @entity1			2
" @entity136 was deemed to be of essence			0
there was fear of a pending attack " in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks			2
" could you have gotten the information some other way ? we 'll never know , " said @entity146 , @entity1 terrorism analyst , who doubts the information divulged after waterboarding saved @entity12 lives			0
" did it really avert imminent terrorist attacks , according to these documents ? no , " he said			1
" @entity39 certainly revealed a lot of information after being waterboarded ... but it turns out these plots were just talk			0
" but @entity2 said enhanced interrogations contributed to most of the successful arrests of @entity38 members			1
" i think they were directly responsible for the fact that for eight years we had no further mass casualty attacks against the @entity12 , " he said sunday			0
@entity1 's @entity163 and @entity164 contributed to this report .			0
