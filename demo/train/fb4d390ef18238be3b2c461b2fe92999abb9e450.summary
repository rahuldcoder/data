-- @entity1 will add new privacy features after a hack last week that exposed millions of phone numbers and user names from the popular photo - and video - sharing app. the company said in a blog post it will be updating the app to allow users to opt out of a " @entity14 " feature that uses their mobile phone number			1
they 'll also be adding internal restrictions that will make it more difficult to employ the method hackers say they used to expose 4.6 million accounts			2
" the @entity1 community is a place where friends feel comfortable expressing themselves and we 're dedicated to preventing abuse , " @entity1 said in the post , which did not include an apology to its users			2
on tuesday , hackers posted user names and phone numbers , with the final two numbers redacted , to a website called @entity33			1
the site had been suspended by its web host but , by friday , appeared to be back online with phone numbers and user names both partially disguised			1
the site made the data available for download and offered , by request , to consider releasing unredacted info , which matched the user names with the phone numbers associated with them			1
the hack appears to have been an effort to push @entity1 into improving its privacy protections			0
" our motivation behind the release was to raise the public awareness around the issue , and also put public pressure on @entity1 to get this exploit fixed , " the hackers said in a statement released to news outlets			0
" it is understandable that tech startups have limited resources but security and privacy should not be a secondary goal			0
security matters as much as user experience does			0
" last week , @entity64 -- a group of " white hat " hackers , meaning they do n't exploit the security gaps they find -- published what they said was code that would enable such a hack			0
the @entity72 group said @entity1 implemented " very minor obstacles " after that			0
in the blog post , @entity1 said it had added security measures after @entity78 suggested in august that such a hack was possible , but that the group 's @entity81 post had more details that made @entity1 's system easier to exploit			1
sources told @entity86 last month that @entity1 has about 30 million monthly active users and more than 16 million daily users .			2

@entity1 will let users opt out of " @entity14 " after last week 's hack
@entity93 's say they matched 4.6 million user names with phone numbers
move was meant to urge @entity1 to improve security
