@entity0 , @entity1 -- protesters , @entity4 and now rock ' n rollers			1
@entity1 's growing demonstration over a budget bill that supporters call vital and opponents label union - busting continues monday with guitarist @entity11 of @entity13 fame planning to play for the protesters a day after @entity15 gov. @entity15 signaled no retreat on the measure			1
the growing crowds gathering daily in @entity0 , the state capital , over the issue exceeded 50,000 on saturday , according to an official estimate , and shows no sign of abating			2
" history is happening in the streets of @entity0 , @entity1 and i 'm going to be there , " said a statement by @entity11 , who will perform in his solo identity as @entity26			0
calling the proposed budget law " unjust , " @entity11 said he will join " teachers , students , firefighters , policemen , @entity34 , nurses , steel workers , construction workers and religious groups that are filling the streets to protest			2
" he referred to @entity15 as " the @entity40 " in reference to the @entity43 leader ousted by popular protest , and accused the governor and unnamed corporate allies of trying to " rob @entity48 workers of their fundamental rights			1
" the @entity51 proposed by @entity15 to address a $ 137 million shortfall through june 30 would increase contributions of state workers for their pensions and health insurance benefits			1
it also requires collective bargaining units to conduct annual votes to maintain certification , a costly procedure , and eliminates the right of unions to have dues deducted from worker paychecks			0
last week , 14 @entity67 state senators essentially boycotted the legislature and went to @entity69 to prevent a quorum from passing the bill			1
the measure 's opponents say they wo n't allow a vote unless @entity15 negotiates on the plan to eliminate collective bargaining rights for everything but wages			1
@entity15 rejected such a deal sunday in an interview on " @entity81			1
" he called the @entity67 complaint of union - busting " a red herring " and said significant changes were needed for budgetary reasons , but powerful public employee unions were able to block the necessary adjustments			1
" if we 're going to ask our state and local workers who are doing a great job to pay a little bit more , to sacrifice , to help to balance this budget , we should also give them the flexibility saying that for those members , for those workers , who do n't want to be a part of the union , if you do n't want that deduction each month out of the paycheck , they should be able to get that $ 500 , $ 600 or in some cases , $ 1,000 back that they can apply for their health care and their pension contribution , " @entity15 said			1
@entity67 @entity108 sen. @entity108 of neighboring @entity69 disagreed , saying that anyone who thinks the bill is only about money and the budget would also think that the rev. @entity113 was working only for @entity114 to have access to restaurants			1
" there 's a much bigger issue at stake here , " @entity108 said on the @entity118 program " @entity119 , " adding that @entity15 " is not setting out just to fix a budget ; he 's setting out to break a union			1
" however , @entity126 rep. @entity126 of @entity1 said the events in his state are a microcosm of the budget pressure felt by governors throughout the country			2
" it just shows the point , all levels of government have been making empty promises to people , " @entity126 said on the @entity134 program " @entity135			0
" " and these governors are telling people the truth			0
" @entity15 said he hoped the @entity67 state senators would return to @entity0 so that debate on the bill could ensue , but added that all options were on the table -- including a possible contempt proceeding -- if they do n't			1
on saturday , @entity151 activists supporting the bill brought a new dimension to the street demonstration			1
" @entity1 is ground zero , " said @entity155 , president of @entity156			0
" i think it is going to determine largely whether the pampered nature of these public employees is finally reigned in			0
" one of the missing @entity67 state senators , @entity162 , said all state and local public employees -- including teachers -- have agreed to the financial aspects of @entity15 's requested concessions on paying more for employee health care and pensions			1
" in return they ask only that the provisions that deny their right to collectively bargain are removed , " @entity162 said			0
" this will solve the budget challenge			2
" @entity15 , however , said it was necessary to change the collective bargaining rules because the alternative would be laying off thousands of state employees			2
" i ca n't have anybody laid off , " he said on @entity81			0
" i do n't want a single person laid off in the public nor in the private sector , and that 's why this is a much better alternative than to losing jobs			0
" until saturday 's counter-demonstrators appeared , the growing protests since monday were largely made up of those against @entity15 's plan			1
they remained the clear majority of those marching , with of them on saturday drawn by the arrival of @entity15 's supporters			2
there were no reports of major incidents or arrests by late saturday afternoon , and authorities expressed their gratitude			0
" on behalf of all the law enforcement agencies that helped keep the peace on the @entity206 saturday , a very sincere thank you to all of those who showed up to exercise their first amendment rights , " @entity0 police said in a statement			0
" you conducted yourselves with great decorum and civility , and if the eyes of the nation were upon @entity1 , then you have shown how democracy can flourish even amongst those who passionately disagree			0
" @entity219 press secretary @entity218 addressed the continued protests friday , saying president @entity228 " is very understanding of the need for state governments , governors , state legislatures to reduce spending to make tough choices to be fiscally responsible			0
" but he added , " he also feels very strongly that we need not to make this an assault on the collective bargaining rights of workers in any given state			0
" he understands public employees need to make sacrifices just like everyone else			0
" @entity15 and other @entity126 criticized @entity228 on sunday for getting involved in the issue , calling it inappropriate			2
@entity2 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .			0
