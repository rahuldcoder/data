@entity0 , @entity1 -- a chain link fence now stands between @entity5 's land and the impact site of @entity7 , which crashed here on september 11 , 2001			1
the property has been in @entity5 's family for almost 80 years			1
a temporary memorial has been set up to honor the victims of the @entity7 crash			1
" my grandfather purchased about 200 acres in the 1930s , and he would cut timber and sell the timber off , and he would build cabins as well , " @entity5 says			1
" that 's how he got the family through the @entity21			1
" @entity5 says he had no plans for the land , he just knew he wanted to hold on to it			1
" there 's a lot of natural resources in this area -- natural gas , coal , " he says			2
that all changed the day 40 passengers and crew died trying to take control of a @entity35 757 that had been hijacked by four terrorists as it took off from @entity37 , @entity38 , bound for @entity39 , @entity40			1
it is believed the hijackers had intended crash the plane into the @entity45 or the @entity46			2
plans for a permanent memorial have been in the works for years			1
@entity50 passed a law in 2002 instructing the @entity52 to establish a national memorial where the crash occurred			1
part of it would be on @entity5 's land			2
in the seven years since , some of the most important land needed for the massive project has remained in limbo , producing an emotional debate among landowners , family members and the @entity52			1
see plans for the proposed @entity66 at the center of the dispute is the government 's plan to take the remaining land needed by using its power of eminent domain			1
the government can seize privately owned property to convert it to public use after paying the owner fair market value			2
@entity5 's land is key to the project			2
he owns 6 acres that are just feet from the crash site			2
he has yet to reach an agreement with the government to buy his land			2
" eminent domain was sort of dropped on us at the last second here , " he says , " and it feels like we never even had a chance to talk about some of the issues that we needed to address during the negotiations			1
" @entity5 still finds debris from the plane on his land			2
" @entity95 and blue wire all over the place , " he says as he bends over to pick up a piece			2
" here it is almost eight years later			2
" the @entity52 says time is running out if the memorial is to be ready by september 11 , 2011 , the 10 - year anniversary of the terrorist attacks			1
it says it has to use eminent domain for 166 essential acres that it has been unable to purchase			1
" we 've held off using it until we 've got here , really at the very last stage of this where we have no other choice , " says @entity52 associate director @entity106			1
the amount of land needed for the memorial is just over 2,200 acres , about 1,400 of which is near the crash site , where there will be a visitor center			2
the other 800 acres would create a buffer around the site to protect the rural setting			0
that is where @entity123 and @entity124 live -- on more than 100 acres of land , 62 of them within the memorial park boundaries			0
the @entity129 enjoy hunting , fishing and horseback riding on their land , which is about three - quarters - of - a - mile from the crash site			0
" this eminent domain cloud hangs over this whole piece of property now , " @entity134 says , standing by a pond where he likes to fish			1
he was a member of a committee formed with @entity66 family members to establish the boundaries of the park			0
" if i knew the @entity52 was going to be able to use eminent domain to acquire property within the park boundary , i would had fought that at the time the park boundary was established to keep as much property out of the park as possible , " @entity124 says			1
the @entity129 now fear that their land is n't safe from the government and say it 's not needed for the memorial			0
" we have to play fair , we have to follow the rules and they just change the law to suit their own needs , " says @entity124			0
for @entity157 , vice president of @entity158 , this project is a labor of love			0
@entity157 's cousin , @entity161 , was killed on @entity7			1
@entity157 is leading the effort to acquire all the land needed for the memorial			0
" we 're creating a place where the 40 heroes of @entity66 can be revered and remembered , " @entity157 said from his law office in @entity166 , @entity167			0
@entity157 says the negotiations with landowners has been challenging and supports the governments use of eminent domain			1
" no one has ever questioned that there is a public purpose to these lands ' " @entity157 says			0
" their purpose became public the minute that those private citizens ' lives and remains became part of those lands			0
" @entity5 says he feels the same way as he walks just a few feet from where the plane crashed			1
" a lot of people lost their lives here and this is their final resting place			0
... that 's one thing i always keep in mind when i come here and i am walking through these woods			0
" this is n't just about money , @entity134 says			0
it 's about doing what 's right , allowing landowners to continue to live on their land and use it the way they intended before that day			0
" that loss of freedom is probably the thing that bothers people more than anything else , " he says			0
neither the government nor landowners will comment on how much money has been offered for the land yet to be acquired			0
@entity157 said he remains confident the memorial will be completed in time			0
" getting this done is a commitment that must be achieved			0
... these are folks who as citizen soldiers stood up and we all need to recognize that at a place that 's appropriate			0
" to make that happen , the @entity52 says it needs to start construction this november for a ribbon - cutting ceremony on september 11 , 2011			1
the courts may have the final say			0
government lawyers are expected to file a lawsuit in @entity229 next week to condemn the property for public use .			0

hijacked @entity7 crashed in @entity1 during the 9/11 attacks
@entity52 says it needs to start construction soon
emotional debate on eminent domain has thrown a *wrench* in the plans
