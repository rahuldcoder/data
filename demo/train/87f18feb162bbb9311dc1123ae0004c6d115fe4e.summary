-- meet @entity2 's family			1
there 's @entity4 , his father , a much - decorated @entity6 fighter pilot nicknamed " @entity7			1
" he had a volatile temper and terrorized his children , particularly @entity10 , his oldest			2
" i hated my father long before i knew there was a word for hate , " he writes in his recently released memoir , " the death of @entity13			1
" there 's @entity19 , his mother , who presented herself as a southern belle and raised @entity10 and his six siblings			1
she threatened to leave the abusive @entity4 constantly , but stayed for years , helping to create what @entity10 saw as a household of haunted souls			2
one sister is now estranged ; one brother committed suicide			0
of course , if you 've read @entity2 's novels -- including " @entity7 , " " @entity30 " and " @entity31 " -- you 've probably already met his family			1
" i 've been writing the story of my own life for 40 years , " he observes in the new book			0
it has n't always been fiction , either			1
@entity2 has two other memoirs to his credit , 1972 's " @entity42 " ( about a year teaching on a poverty - stricken @entity45 island ) and 2002 's " @entity39 " ( about his @entity41 basketball team )			1
but in " the @entity46 , " @entity2 decided to confront his personal history more directly			1
he interviewed family members and friends , retells old stories from new angles and tries to put himself in the shoes of his parents			1
he addresses some of his own wounds , including the stepdaughter -- brought to fictional life in " @entity31 " -- who has n't spoken to him in more than 14 years			1
" this is my punishment for coming out of this family , i think , " he says in a phone interview			1
" it is the hardest thing i 've ever dealt with			0
" the book has generally received positive reviews			0
" ( it ) recognizes that while fiction calls for lucid explanations and a certain tidiness , life resists both , " wrote @entity66 in the @entity67			0
@entity0 caught up with @entity2 by phone in @entity74 , where he was staying during an early tour stop			1
though the @entity45 - based writer was still shaking off travel fatigue , he waxed eloquent on his complicated relationship with family members , the toll of violence and even bullying in the @entity82			1
the following is an edited and condensed version of the interview			0
@entity0 : why did you decide to write this memoir , considering it 's material you 've already used in your novels ? @entity2 : @entity90 had to die before i could do this			1
all my books have been hinting around at so much of this , and i wanted to get down what i think happened			0
and after writing " @entity7 , " i think i owed @entity97 something for the way he made a turnaround			1
that was remarkable to me			0
he did something very good and very rare in a human life when he did it			0
@entity0 : after " @entity13 " comes out , in the book you go from using the word " hate " about your father to what seems like respect and then love			1
@entity2 : he was the meanest man i ever met in my life , and i could not believe my bad fortune of me and my brothers and sisters being raised by this guy and my poor mother being married to the guy			1
it was only when " @entity7 " was published he seemed to even take a look at who he was			1
@entity0 : he does n't seem to be the most introspective gentleman			1
@entity2 : oh , please			1
i do n't think @entity97 had a moment of introspection in his entire life -- ever			2
even when i relay ( these stories ) to the world , @entity97 simply denies it			0
he can be funny about it : " i hope you enjoy my son 's latest work of fiction			2
" old loveable , likable @entity4			0
@entity97 was a very charming man			0
i did n't know that until the book came out			2
@entity0 : your mother knew more of herself than she let on			2
on the outside she was a polished @entity137 , and on the inside she came from hardscabble @entity139			0
and she hated to admit that			0
@entity2 : i can see it from @entity90 's point of view now			1
she was from the poorest white @entity45 possible			0
she ends up marrying a @entity6 officer , so she was an officer 's wife			2
she had these seven children , and when we would pray that she would leave @entity97 or divorce him , she had nowhere to go and no way to raise these children			0
i think @entity90 was perfectly trapped			0
i adored her , and some of the brothers and sisters do not			0
they blame @entity90 for putting us through that			0
i did n't think she had a chance			2
@entity0 : i read some of the book with my jaw hanging open , yet i have mixed feelings about your sister @entity160 , who has cut herself off from the family			2
@entity2 : @entity160 was the one who did what was probably the natural thing -- the family damaged her , she realized it damaged her , and she said bye - bye to all this			1
we only see @entity160 at funerals and weddings			0
she does n't talk to any of us			2
we do n't have a relationship with her			1
but i think that 's a natural order of things in families this conflicted and this brutalized			2
you lose a couple of ' em along the way			0
@entity0 : is @entity160 really as operatic as she comes off in the book ? @entity2 : oh my @entity186 , are you kidding ? she wins that award more than anybody i 've ever known			1
it 's her way with the world			2
@entity0 : i wonder , given your violent household , if you 've given any thought to what 's in the headlines -- the bullying with the @entity197 , the stress on military families with @entity200			2
@entity2 : the thing with @entity206 ... what i think that poor @entity203 kid ( @entity204 ) should have done is sucker - punch ( @entity209 ) @entity208			1
generally , in a male situation , that is what helps			0
( but ) obviously this guy is a thinking , feeling creation ( that 's ) rare in the @entity82			2
i think he 'll never be forgiven			0
i think his career is over			0
@entity0 : when you write about characters such as your father and his rages , how much do you put yourself in their shoes ? @entity2 : always , and totally			1
it 's easy for me			2
when i hear about 13 - year - old kids gunning their father down in bed , i always think , i 'm lucky that 's not me			1
i thought it a zillion times when i was growing up			0
it 's a terrible thing to say , but i thought it			2
@entity0 : did you keep a journal growing up ? @entity2 : no. if i 'd kept one , he 'd have read it , and that would have been it			1
there would have been no books			0
there would have been no me			0
@entity0 : despite the horrific stories , there 's obviously a lot of strength in your family			1
@entity2 : thank you for telling me that , because this ( book ) kills me			1
@entity0 : well , when it was over , what were your feelings ? was it cathartic ? @entity2 : what i 've noticed is we 're sort of stoical			1
i gave it to my brother @entity253 , the dark one , and i hear he was most afraid of the book			0
when i called him about it , he said , " you know , @entity10 , i think you 've written an adequate book			0
" ( laughs ) i said , that 's high praise from this family			1
my brother @entity262 was the most honest			0
he said , " oh , thanks , @entity264 i 'll tell you in 30 years whether i love it or hate it			0
reading it was like hitting myself with a lead pipe for 350 pages			0
i hated every minute of it , and i blame you totally because @entity90 are dead			0
" @entity0 : did he say that with humor ? @entity2 : he said it with some humor			1
but he was reading it to his wife and she kept weeping			0
he said , " what 's wrong ? " and she said , " you were just children			2
