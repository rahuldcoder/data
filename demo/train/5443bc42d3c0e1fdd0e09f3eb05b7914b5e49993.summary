@entity0 -- president @entity2 on friday resumed -- with expanded legal protections -- the @entity6 administration 's controversial system of military trials for some @entity9 detainees			1
president @entity2 says the commissions are ok , " provided that they are properly structured and administered			1
" on the heels of @entity2 's shift this week to block the release of photos showing prisoners allegedly being abused by @entity19 personnel in @entity20 and @entity21 , the military commissions announcement further infuriated the president 's most ardent supporters while winning cautionary praise from some of his political foes			1
@entity2 said he supports the idea of the military commissions but opposes the version of the law that had been governing such trials in recent years : the @entity32 put in place under the @entity6 administration in 2006 , but subsequently struck down as unconstitutional by the @entity35			1
the president said military commissions " are appropriate for trying enemies who violate the laws of war , provided that they are properly structured and administered			0
" but , he said , the 2006 act " failed to establish a legitimate legal framework and undermined our capability to ensure swift and certain justice against those detainees			0
" he said he plans to enhance due process rights for detainees held at the @entity19 facility in @entity9 , @entity50 , in order to improve the widely criticized approach created by his predecessor			1
statements that have been obtained from detainees through interrogation and cruel treatment , such as waterboarding , will no longer be admitted as evidence before the commissions , @entity2 said , and hearsay evidence will be limited			1
the revised system also will give detainees greater latitude in selecting legal representation and afford basic protections to those who refuse to testify			2
military commission judges also will be able to establish the jurisdiction of their own courts			0
" these reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " @entity2 said			1
he said he plans to ask @entity77 to enact other reforms to the 2006 law			2
sen. @entity80 , @entity81 , applauded his former opponent			0
" today 's announcement is a step -- but only a step -- toward a comprehensive detainee policy that will deal with the detainees held at @entity9 and elsewhere in a fashion that both accords with our values and protects our national security , " @entity80 said in a written statement			0
but @entity2 's announcement infuriated some of his core supporters -- with the revisions hardly calming the concerns of groups such as the @entity100			1
the @entity100 chided the military commission decision as " a striking blow to due process and the rule of law			1
" " these military commissions are inherently illegitimate , unconstitutional and incapable of delivering outcomes we can trust , " said @entity105 , the group 's executive director			0
" tweaking the rules of these failed tribunals so that they provide ' more due process ' is absurd ; there is no such thing as ' due process light			1
" if the administration 's proposed rules really bring these proceedings in line with constitutional requirements , there is no reason not to use our tried and true justice system			2
if they do n't , these tribunals have no place in our democracy			0
" @entity130 spokesman @entity129 countered that military commissions have a long history in the @entity19			0
" first and foremost , the president of the @entity19 is going to do what he believes is in the best security interest of the people of the @entity19 , " @entity129 told reporters			0
@entity2 suspended the military commissions by signing an executive order on his third day in office , the same day he signed an order to close the @entity19 military prison at @entity9 within a year and announced a 120 - day review of the whole process			1
the review deadline is next week			0
@entity129 said he does not know where and how trials for alleged terrorists will unfold on @entity19 soil			0
nor did he disclose how many suspects would face legal proceedings under the revised commissions			2
three @entity9 detainees ' cases have gone through the commission so far			0
the @entity6 administration established the military trial system after the @entity19 military began capturing detainees in @entity21 in late 2001			1
the next year , it opened the @entity9 facility , saying suspects were treated properly and received due process through the system			1
but legal organizations and human rights agencies have repeatedly challenged the system on grounds that detainees were mistreated			2
one lawyer representing a client at @entity9 said closing the detention facility , which @entity2 is advocating , is a " meaningless gesture " if the military commissions continue			2
" the military commissions are fundamentally flawed and ca n't be fixed , " said @entity175 maj. @entity174 , a lawyer for @entity176 , one of five 9/11 defendants charged in the military commission process			0
@entity180 , the self - confessed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks , is the most high - profile of those defendants .			0

@entity2 revives @entity6 system that was suspended in *january*
new system to include expanded due - process rights for the suspects , @entity2 says
@entity100 calls move " a striking blow to due process and the rule of law "
