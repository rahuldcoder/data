-- for @entity2 this week , two worlds collide			1
its captivating side -- led by the tournament 's star man @entity5 -- is preparing for its first ever @entity8 quarterfinal on friday , hinting at a future full of promise			1
but that glamor tie against hosts @entity12 also comes 20 years after perhaps @entity15 football 's darkest hour -- the murder of former national team player @entity17			1
the 27 - year - old defender was a victim of a volatile and violent chapter in the country 's history , seemingly executed as punishment for scoring an own goal at the 1994 @entity8			1
@entity17 's error contributed to a 2 - 1 defeat at the hands of hosts @entity27 and six days after @entity2 's tournament ended , on july 2 , he was shot six times by gunmen in his home town of @entity32			1
the murder was linked to drug lords who had suffered big gambling losses due to @entity2 's exit at the group stage but nothing was ever proven			1
two decades on as @entity2 prepares for one the biggest clashes in its history -- delivered by a squad that is seen as a symbol of hope -- the significance of the @entity17 anniversary is not lost on the country			1
just like in 1994 it has a crop of gifted players ready to gatecrash the party at soccer 's top table			0
@entity5 has been the stand out star , his sublime goal in the last 16 win over @entity59 a signpost for the country 's emerging potential			0
their jaunty choreographed goal celebrations have also struck a chord with the watching world , who are ever more connected through social media			0
this vivacious side has also energized @entity2 , the public hoping this verve and swagger can help chart a new path for a country that has for so long been synonymous with drugs and violence			1
whether that happens or not , @entity17 will not be forgotten			2
" @entity17 - always in our hearts , " wrote @entity2 's most capped international and @entity17 's former teammate -- @entity82 on @entity83			1
" we 'll never forget your kindness , your humility and your fight			0
i miss you bro , i miss you			0
" the @entity17 name will be also present in @entity90 on friday			1
as @entity2 take on not just @entity12 's players but also a fervent home nation , @entity17 ' brother and sister will be present , as they have been for every @entity2 match in the competition so far			1
@entity97 and @entity98 will be bedecked in the team 's famous yellow kit , complete with @entity17 's name and his famous number 2 on the back			2
the defender 's former teammates @entity104 and @entity106 are with the current squad , but all of them will know what became of one of its illustrious predecessors			0
" @entity17 is with them and the rest of the team in spirit , " @entity97 told @entity115 's official website			2
" people should enjoy football with passion , but never forgetting it 's a game			0
( what happened to @entity17 ) should serve as a cautionary tale : there is no place for violence			2
" @entity129 should unite the country around a message of peace and love			0
" twenty years is a long time and it 's really upsetting to think about , but i prefer to thank @entity137 for having given us the chance to have him with us for 27 years , for lending him to us			2
" his life was cut short , but he did important things in that time			0
" the pair accepted an invitation from world football 's governing body to attend @entity2 's matches , partly to be away from home when the 20th anniversary came around			2
" i wanted to escape @entity32 , because there @entity150 's death will be talked about in all the news programs and papers and it would be very tough , " @entity97 explained			0
" i 'd rather spend it here , with the family , and then hold a memorial service when we go back home			0
" @entity17 was rumored to be on the verge of a switch to @entity162 giants @entity161 prior to his death after seven years at @entity15 club @entity164			1
he also had a spell at @entity166 in @entity167 but it was in his native @entity2 he is remembered most fondly , and afforded the nickname " @entity172 " which translates as " the gentlemen of football			2
" " sometimes i think it 'd be better if people did n't remember @entity17 every day , because it 's really painful , " his brother @entity98 explained			0
" but he left a mark , so it 's normal			0
