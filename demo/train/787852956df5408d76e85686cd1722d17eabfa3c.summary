they said they made more than 100 arrests			1
@entity8 , wanted by the @entity16 for the former @entity17 in connection with the 1995 @entity20 massacre , was captured thursday after nearly 16 years in hiding			1
the @entity21 held its protest sunday in front of @entity0 's parliament building			0
despite calls for calm from the event 's organizers , demonstrators on the fringes of the rally threw rocks at police			1
hundreds of officers , some in riot gear and others on horseback , moved in against the crowd			0
some beat and kicked protesters			2
police stayed on the streets as the demonstrators scattered			2
" we are gathered here to peacefully protest the betrayal by ( @entity0 president ) @entity50 and his bosses in @entity52 , " party leaders told the crowd before the clashes erupted			1
" we have had enough economic humiliation by our enemies , who are destroying our country ... in every way			0
" at the protest -- which was attended by members of @entity8 's family and thousands of others -- speakers demanded that @entity50 step down and asked that elections be held immediately			1
@entity8 's son , @entity63 , told the crowd that his father is sick			1
" he needs medical treatment that he is not getting , " the younger @entity8 said			1
he described his father as " a freedom fighter , " and said he had " defended his own nation , defended his people , which was his job			2
" the younger @entity8 called on protesters to keep their demonstration peaceful			1
" tomorrow if i 'm able to visit my father , i will tell him of this and he will cry again , " he said			0
@entity8 gave himself up without a fight , despite having two handguns , according to @entity77 , the government minister in charge of searching for fugitive suspected war criminals			1
officials located @entity8 in a village called @entity82 , north of the @entity0 capital , after culling information from his former comrades , those who supported him financially and his close family members , @entity77 said			1
it is not clear what source led investigators to the former military commander , accused of ordering the 1995 massacre of some 8,000 @entity92 in the eastern @entity94 town of @entity20			0
his arrest clears a major hurdle that once stood between @entity0 and its long - awaited entrance into the @entity100 , but the move could also usher in political backlash from the country 's electorate , some of whom consider @entity8 a hero			2
" we 're conscious of this danger , " @entity77 told @entity2 saturday			0
" we know we did something that did n't bring us joy or applause from the public			0
but we also know that we took great responsibility and did something that the political elite of any country is supposed to do			0
" he called @entity8 's capture " a political investment , " noting the government 's desire to bring the war crimes suspect to justice " even if citizens punish us in the next elections			2
" the massacre at @entity20 , which sparked international outcry and preceded a @entity128 bombing campaign , is now remembered as the worst atrocity in @entity130 since @entity131 @entity8 allegedly presided over the five - day slaughter in july where @entity92 men and boys were systematically executed in what was described at the @entity137 war crimes tribunal as " the triumph of evil			2
" @entity8 's forces encircled the town , a @entity137 - declared " safe area " where thousands of @entity143 had sought refuge , allegedly conducting wholesale slaughter and rape , despite the presence of a few hundred lightly armed @entity149 @entity137 peacekeepers charged with protecting the area 's residents and its refugees			2
the former general is considered the last of the fugitive war criminal suspects in the region , following the capture of @entity158 leader @entity157 and former @entity0 president @entity159 , who died in jail in 2006 during his trial at the @entity162			0
at the rally sunday , a defiant @entity163 told the crowd , " we will never accept those who bombed us to write our history			0
for centuries we have been fighting for our own state , for our own country to give us security			0
we do n't allow illiterate westerners to write our history			0
" a medical team has determined that @entity8 is healthy enough to be extradited to face a war crimes tribunal , a court spokeswoman in @entity1 said friday			1
while the war crimes suspect suffers from several chronic conditions , the team said there are no immediate problems barring a move			0
this comes after five doctors examined @entity8 thursday night , according to the ex-general 's lawyer , @entity185			1
