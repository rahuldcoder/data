-- last year on december 1 -- @entity1 -- president @entity2 said that creating an " aids - free generation " around the world was finally within our grasp			1
this @entity1 , let 's help him achieve that goal			2
and let 's start in the @entity10			1
while the aids research and activist communities continue to celebrate some major breakthroughs during the past few years , we continue to struggle with an epidemic in the @entity10 that grows unabated			1
each year , 50,000 @entity10 become newly infected with @entity17 -- the virus that causes @entity13 -- and more than 1.1 million people are living with the virus			1
and while everyone is at risk and should know their status , data tell us that communities of color -- particularly black women and young , black gay , bisexual and other men who have sex with men -- are disproportionately affected by the virus			1
if we 're going to create an aids - free generation here at home , we need to start investing in resources that will curb the epidemic among these populations			1
@entity36 unveils ' blueprint ' to combat @entity13 according to a @entity39 study released at this year 's @entity40 , nearly 6 % of black men under the age of 30 who have sex with men are newly infected with @entity17 every year in six cities across the @entity10			1
that 's three times the rate among white men who have sex with men			2
perhaps most alarming , a @entity52 study claims that 60 % of black men who have sex with men will have @entity17 by age 40			0
among black women , the @entity56 estimates that nearly 1 in 32 black women will become infected with @entity17 in their lifetime			0
and despite representing 14 % of the female @entity10 population , black women make up 66 % of all new hiv infections among women , according to the @entity64			1
when statistics are this shocking , we must take action			0
in his @entity1 address last year , @entity2 said , " when new infections among young , black , gay men increase by nearly 50 % in three years , we need to do more to show them that their lives matter			0
when @entity74 are dying sooner than other groups ; when black women feel forgotten even though they account for most of the new cases among women , we need to do more			0
" so : what can we do to make people feel like they matter , and feel like we have n't forgotten them ? one thing we can all do right now is go get tested -- and encourage our friends and neighbors to get tested , too			1
knowing your status is the first step to curbing the epidemic			1
go to hivtest.cdc.gov to find out where to get tested in your neighborhood			0
if you test negative , learn how to stay that way			0
if you test positive , learn your treatment options and take control of your health			0
second , we must fight the disease -- not the people who have it			1
we need an open dialogue among families , schools , and churches about the risks of @entity17 , and we need to recognize the role stigma plays in pushing the epidemic underground and unchecked			2
stigma against people living with this disease , or who are particularly vulnerable to it , has no place in our evidence - based quest to stop the spread of @entity13			1
we must hate this disease ; we must never hate our fellow human beings			2
third , we must educate everyone -- particularly black women and young black men -- about their vulnerability to the virus			1
everyone has a right to feel empowered to take control of their sexual lives and the health of themselves and their families			0
half of young people with @entity17 do n't know it finally , we need to realize that @entity13 will remain with us as long as we keep our guard down			2
the dialogue we start this week needs to take place every day , not just @entity1			0
talk to your kids about the importance of safe sex and abstinence			0
talk to your partners about the importance of monogamy			0
thirty years into the @entity13 epidemic , we can finally see , in the distance , an end			2
we finally possess the ability to change this region 's , and the world 's , future			0
will you join us in helping us create a truly @entity13 - free generation by first creating one here at home ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity149 and @entity150 .			0

we continue to struggle with an unabated hiv epidemic in the @entity10
communities of color are disproportionately affected by the virus
we must fight the disease -- not the people who have it , say @entity161 representatives
