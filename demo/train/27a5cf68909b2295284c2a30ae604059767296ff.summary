-- first things first : i did n't watch monday night 's @entity3			1
i did not even know it was on			2
the last time i might have tuned into such a program was in middle school , the height of insecurity			2
i was short , scrawny and getting used to my first pair of oversized glasses			2
my thick dark hair would n't lay flat like the blondes with their perfect wispy bangs			2
not yet " developed " like many of my peers , i 'm sure watching glamorous half - naked models parade around on stage was just what my young psyche needed			2
when i came into work tuesday morning , i was greeted with an e-mail that made me think about the pageant for the first time in decades			0
it contained the final question posed to finalist @entity27 of @entity28 , now our universe 's newly crowned @entity3			1
" if you could change one of your physical characteristics , " the designated judge asked her , " which one would it be and why ? " are you ( insert profanity ) kidding me ? after standing under the magnifying glass of millions , this 25 - year - old , 5 - foot - 10 Â½ - inch knockout had to publicly contemplate if she was physically good enough			1
her response was quick : " thank @entity43 i am very - well satisfied with the way @entity43 created me , and i would n't change a thing			1
i consider myself a woman endowed with inner beauty			0
... i have acquired many wonderful principles from my family , and i plan to follow these through the rest of my life			0
and now i would like to give all of you a piece of advice : respect one another			0
" her answer was applauded			1
@entity59 ' win , the first for @entity28 , was announced soon after			1
maybe it 's absurd to be dismayed that a question like this would be posed at a beauty pageant			2
in my worldview , the mere fact that pageants exist is absurd			0
and i 'm not alone			0
" it fits into the narrative du jour for women -- my body is infinitely malleable , " said @entity68 , editor of @entity69 and author of titles including " @entity72 , @entity73 : how the quest for perfection is harming @entity80			0
" " if i have enough willpower and money , i can look like anyone , " she said			0
" this invisibilizes physiology and metabolism and leads women to internalize shame when so much is simply not in their control			0
" we live in a world where in the @entity93 alone $ 10.1 billion was spent on cosmetic procedures in 2010 , according to the @entity95			0
and @entity3 has got to be the apex of all pageants -- the ultimate aspiration for all those fake - tanned toddlers running around in tiaras , between tantrums , on reality - tv			1
but , seriously , who came up with this question ? each of the five finalists was asked something different			1
one judge asked miss @entity109 about nudity on beaches			1
another asked miss @entity114 about her stance on war			1
miss @entity118 had to contemplate if she 'd change her religious beliefs in order to marry , and miss @entity122 was invited to ponder whom in history she 'd trade her life with if she had the chance			1
@entity27 drew from a bowl the name of the judge who would ask her a question			1
@entity133 , an award - winning @entity134 singer and actress who made a name for herself on @entity138 , was the voice behind the question			2
she looked down at a card and read			0
but it turns out the question was n't @entity133 's			1
on @entity145 , her fans wanted to know why she asked such a thing			1
@entity133 tweeted that she did not write the question			2
" all our questions are pre-written and each judge is assigned one			0
luck of the draw , " @entity133 tweeted			0
the questions were " written by the guys at @entity3 " she said in a response to one fan			1
" we had no say " in what the questions would be , she said in another			0
follower @ sassy_dimple wanted more			0
" i am surprised they have that ( question ) on their list , " she said			2
" but if you are given the chance to ask a question to any of the candidates , what would it be and why ? " " it would have been on feminism and pageants , gay marriage , or separation bet			2
church and state , " @entity133 responded			0
" @entity133 reiterated tuesday afternoon in a written statement to @entity0 that she and the other judges had no say when it came to the questions			0
" as for the quality of the actual question , i do n't have much of an opinion on that ( truth be told , it 's a standard beauty contest query ... i would have asked about something more controversial ... ) , " she wrote			1
" at the end of the day , it was n't so much the question asked but the manner in which it was answered			1
i reached out to the " guys at @entity3 " to ask them about their line of questioning			1
my calls and e-mails went unreturned			0
so i turned to the guy , @entity201 , owner of the @entity203 and , oh yeah , one - time potential candidate for @entity93 president			0
i asked him to explain why this was a question worth asking			1
i also tossed the query back to him			0
mr. @entity201 , if you could change one of your physical characteristics , which one would it be and why ? i 'm still waiting for his answer .			1

miss @entity28 2011 , @entity27 , was crowned @entity3 monday night
she was asked what physical characteristic she 'd change about herself
her answer , one *heartily* applauded , was that she would n't change a thing
but who *decided* this was a question worth asking ?
