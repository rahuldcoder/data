-- @entity2 co-owner @entity1 is " moving quickly " to sell the embattled @entity4 franchise , with a source familiar with the situation saying she and her representatives would like to make a deal this week			1
the recent activity includes talks with several high - profile potential suitors for the team , and @entity4 commissioner @entity14 is " very much involved " in @entity1 's dealings with potential buyers , according to the source			1
but as bidders make their pitches for his team , @entity21 -- @entity1 's estranged husband and the team 's other owner -- accused the @entity4 of violating his constitutional rights in trying to end his ownership of the franchise based on what he says was an illegally recorded conversation during a lovers ' quarrel , according to a document provided by @entity21 's attorney			1
the document , @entity1 's 26 - page response to charges of violating the league 's bylaws , adhered to the @entity4 's tuesday deadline for the billionaire businessman 's reply			1
the @entity4 has said the next step will be a special @entity45 meeting on june 3 , when the league 's 30 ownership groups -- someone else will represent the @entity2 -- will meet to hear evidence on @entity21 's behavior , then vote on terminating the @entity52 ' ownership rights			1
@entity1 has been prejudged and wo n't get a fair hearing , the document says , citing comments from 10 other teams			2
about one month ago , @entity14 banned @entity1 from @entity4 facilities and functions and ordered him to pay a record fine after racist remarks by the @entity2 ' owner to former companion @entity62 surfaced online			1
a source close to the situation said roughly two weeks ago that @entity21 -- who repeatedly denied he 's a racist in a @entity0 interview -- would n't pay the fine , would reject the ban and might sue the @entity4			1
the document says @entity1 faces a never - before - issued and unjust punishment			0
" in reality , mr. @entity1 is being banned for life , fined $ 2.5 million , and stripped of his ownership rights for a purely private conversation with his lover that he did not know was being recorded and that he never intended to see the light of day , " the document says			0
other @entity4 figures have made bigoted or racially insensitive remarks and were n't punished as harshly , @entity1 argues			1
his remarks were made in the heat of an argument , and while they were not justified , they were not meant to harm the @entity4 , the response says			0
and while @entity1 's remarks were viewed as racist , he says in his response that he was " instrumental in fostering the diverse body of players , coaches , general managers , employees and fans on which the @entity4 prides itself			1
" the document also says @entity1 was active in the @entity98 - @entity97 community and that there was only one court case -- which he won -- of discrimination brought against him as owner of the @entity2 in more than 30 years			1
@entity1 asks that the @entity4 's charges be denied and that his ownership rights not be terminated			1
the @entity4 acknowledged receiving a response from @entity1 and reaffirmed the june 3 meeting , saying it will start at 1 p.m. et to " hear and vote upon this matter			1
" @entity21 's attorney , @entity107 , had no comment			0
@entity62 has said @entity1 knew she was recording him and that the two were never intimate			0
@entity0 senior legal analyst @entity110 said it appeared the @entity52 were taking a two - track strategy			0
by filing the document , @entity21 is protecting his legal options but , at the same time , he realizes selling the team is the most likely outcome			2
" i do n't think it 's a winning argument , but it is a very impressive document , " @entity110 said			0
possible bidders @entity0 's source on the potential sale said it was a busy @entity122 weekend for @entity1			2
the source indicated she met sunday with a group led by former @entity4 star @entity125 to discuss the sale of the @entity2			1
in addition , the source familiar with the situation said she met over the weekend at her @entity130 , @entity131 , home with ex-microsoft ceo @entity132 , who made an aggressive offer for the franchise			2
@entity1 is interested in fielding offers from billionaire businessman @entity136 , @entity125 's group , entertainment mogul @entity138 and @entity140 founder @entity139 , and entrepreneur @entity141 and his @entity143 partners , who two years ago teamed up to buy baseball 's @entity145			1
@entity141 has been at the center of the story from the outset because of controversial banter between 80 - year - old @entity21 and @entity62			0
after @entity151 first reported those comments , @entity21 lashed out at @entity141 in a @entity0 interview , questioning whether someone who contracted @entity155 should be considered a role model and asking rhetorically " what has he done " for the @entity98 - @entity97 community			0
@entity141 called the whole situation sad in his own interview with @entity0 , in which he urged @entity21 to sell the team			2
the former @entity163 said if that happens -- and if his @entity143 partners are interested -- " we 'll make a run for it			0
" one person who apparently wo n't be the @entity4 franchise 's next owner is media tycoon @entity171			2
despite much buzz in recent weeks , the source familiar with the situation says that @entity171 is " out of the running			0
" the same source said @entity1 will accept offers this week for the @entity2			2
@entity1 's attorney , @entity177 , said no formal offers have been made for the team , which has risen in recent years from a last - place laughingstock to a playoff team with two superstars in forward @entity183 and guard @entity184			2
" @entity1 and the @entity4 are working cooperatively on the transaction , " @entity177 said			1
the @entity52 have been publicly defiant since the story broke , challenging the @entity4 and its right to force the @entity2 ' sale			0
but late last week , the @entity52 agreed that @entity1 would try to sell the @entity4 franchise voluntarily even as the league prepares a vote on terminating their franchise rights			1
the couple own the team through a trust			0
@entity1 previously had said she wanted to own at least part of the franchise , but does n't want to be a controlling partner			0
but if it sold -- likely for between $ 1.5 billion and $ 2 billion , according to the well - placed source -- the @entity4 does n't want either @entity52 to have any ownership stake			2
still , they could take solace in the dizzying profit they 'd make from such a deal ; @entity21 reportedly bought the franchise in 1981 for about $ 12 million			0
his response , though , laments that a forced sale would mean the @entity52 would incur " several hundred million dollars " in taxes they could avoid if they were allowed to keep the franchise and leave the team to their heirs			0
@entity1 's wife , @entity1 : we 're just business partners @entity0 's @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 contributed to this report .			0

@entity21 says he has helped @entity4 become more diverse
the *longtime* owner still fighting @entity4 to keep his team
@entity1 has talked with @entity132 , @entity125 about possible separate bids
