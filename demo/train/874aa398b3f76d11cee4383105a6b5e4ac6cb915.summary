on a night that 's all about flash and high - octane excitement , the commercial stood out for its starkness , both in tone and topic			1
on @entity10 , @entity9 , an anti-domestic violence campaign , teamed up with the @entity12 's ad group for a haunting 60 - second reminder of the barriers to even talking about violence in the home			1
the commercial features the audio of a 911 call , inspired by a real - life call a dispatcher posted on @entity20 , the social networking site , last year			1
in response to a question posed on the popular forum about what calls 911 operators could never shake , one wrote : " i had a call that started out pretty dumb , but was actually pretty serious			2
" it seemed to be dumb because the caller did n't tell of an emergency when asked			0
as posted on @entity20 , the call went : caller : " i 'd like to order a pizza for delivery			1
" dispatcher : " @entity36 , you 've reached 911 " caller : " yeah , i know			1
can i have a large with half pepperoni , half mushroom and peppers ? " dispatcher : " ummm ... i 'm sorry , you know you 've called 911 right ? " caller : " yeah , do you know how long it will be ? " dispatcher : " ok , ma'am , is everything ok over there ? do you have an emergency ? " caller : " yes , i do			2
" the emergency is that she was being physically abused but could n't break away from her attacker to call for help			0
the dispatcher , who has been identified as @entity55 , eventually caught on			0
dispatcher : and you ca n't talk about it because there 's someone in the room with you ? caller : yes , that 's correct			1
do you know how long it will be ? dispatcher : i have an officer about a mile from your location			0
are there any weapons in your house ? caller : nope			0
dispatcher : can you stay on the phone with me ? caller : nope			2
see you soon , thanks			0
reading the words is haunting enough , and heard in the @entity10 spot , they 're chillingly effective			2
the audio plays over images of a home that looks unremarkable , apart for a few telltale signs of disarray			0
and how did the @entity20 post make it to the small screen 's biggest night ? according to @entity90 , a writer saw the post , reached out to @entity55 and got another dispatcher from @entity92 to read a nearly identical version of the call @entity55 recounted			1
the spot reminds " people to listen carefully and look for subtle signs of domestic violence , " the agency told @entity90			1
@entity55 had a similar take , telling @entity101 : " i 'd love for people to understand what distances others have to go to get help			0
