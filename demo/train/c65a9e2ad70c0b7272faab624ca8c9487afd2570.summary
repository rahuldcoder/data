-- @entity2 's @entity1 has been speaking about his rise to the top of the world golf rankings , despite losing the @entity5 final to @entity6 at the weekend			1
the 26 - year - old from @entity8 takes over as world number one from @entity10 , almost 25 years to the month since @entity11 became the first player -- and only other @entity2 -- to head the newly - created rankings in april 1986			1
@entity1 told the official @entity15 website : " i definitely need some time to think about it and let it sink in			2
" the good thing is next week i do n't have a tournament , so maybe then i 'll be able to appreciate what i 've done			0
" what i can say for sure is that it 's an incredibly proud moment			0
not only for me , but also for my family , for the people who have helped me , and obviously for @entity2			0
" to be only the second @entity2 after @entity11 , who was my role model when i was growing up , is a very special feeling			0
@entity1 continued : " when the ranking is published i 'm definitely going to take a picture with my name at the top			1
it does n't feel real to me at the moment , but maybe when i see it in writing then i 'll start to believe i 'm the best golfer in the world			0
" not many people can say they 're the best player in the world at their sport , so i feel very honored and privileged			0
" @entity1 only turned professional in 2005 , but his rapid rise to the top has been phenomenal			1
since winning his first @entity15 tournament in @entity43 in january 2008 , @entity1 has gone on to lift eight more professional titles , including his first major success -- the 2010 @entity47 pga at @entity48 -- and two more victories in @entity43			2
he also played a key role in @entity51 winning the @entity52 at @entity53 last year and won the 2010 race to @entity55 as @entity51 's leading golfer			2
@entity1 becomes only the 14th player , and sixth @entity51 , to become world number one and is the second youngest , behind @entity59 , to hold the honor .			1
