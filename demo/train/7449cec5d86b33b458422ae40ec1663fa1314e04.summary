@entity21 opposition " if more members of @entity114 step up , we can put an end to this form of discrimination once and for all , " @entity28 wrote			1

" @entity168 president @entity167 also slammed @entity11			1
" can you imagine walking into your child 's classroom and meeting a teacher dressed in drag ? neither can most @entity37			0
but unfortunately , that 's just one of the many consequences of adopting a law as dangerous as this one , " he wrote in a blog post friday			0
" preschools , day care centers , summer camps , religious chains like @entity186 or @entity187 -- they 'll all be subject to the law , regardless of their personal beliefs and workplace standards , " @entity167 said			0
