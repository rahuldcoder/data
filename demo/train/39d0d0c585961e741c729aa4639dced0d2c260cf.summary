-- not sure where to go on vacation next year ? to help get you motivated , we 've identified 10 destinations that are sure to make headlines in 2015			2
some will host major global events , while others will celebrate anniversaries , unveil new attractions or stand in @entity12 's spotlight			1
the @entity13 with four hotels , 200,000 square feet of convention space , a 2,000 - seat performing arts center , 18 - hole @entity19 golf course , 30 restaurants and bars , 14 distinct pools and a 100,000 - square - foot casino large enough to rival any in @entity24 or @entity25 , the $ 3.5 billion development known as @entity15 is kind of a big deal			2
in fact , the so - called " @entity13 " is the largest single - phase luxury resort project in the history of the @entity31 and the most substantial currently in development in the @entity33			0
located along @entity35 's famed @entity34 , @entity15 is expected to send ripples across the @entity31 when it opens to the public in late spring 2015 with a grand gala produced by music and entertainment legends @entity42 and @entity43			1
the event is meant to herald the arrival of a new @entity13 -- one full of 21st - century entertainment located right in @entity48 's backyard			1
@entity49 , @entity50 @entity49 , @entity50 , has a population of just 93,072 people , but the small city expects 2 million visitors to ply its medieval streets when it hosts more than 1,000 cultural and artistic events in 2015 as the offical @entity57			1
highlights of the yearlong celebration include an illuminating new @entity61 exhibit , three multidisciplinary arts festivals , numerous public installations and art - infused parties			0
moreover , @entity49 will unveil not one , not two , but an astounding five new museums in april , including @entity67 ( art library ) and @entity69			1
think of 2015 as a coming out party for this former mining and industrial center that 's completely reinventing itself			1
@entity73 a decade ago , you 'd have struggled to find life on the streets of downtown @entity73 after the office lights went dim for the night			1
but what was once the city 's dark center has rapidly transformed into one of its most exciting neighborhoods , with more than 500 shops , restaurants , bars and clubs opening their doors in the past five years alone			0
exciting new hotels like the @entity97 , stores like @entity89 and food venues like the revamped @entity91 -- in addition to the recently completed $ 3 billion sports and entertainment complex known as @entity95 -- have injected downtown with a jolt of energy that 's helped lure visitors and residents away from @entity73 's sunny perimeter and into its urban core			1
the downtown scene is expected to heat up in 2015 when billionaire art collector @entity107 's $ 140 million vanity project , the @entity108 , opens to the public in the fall			1
the honeycomb - encased gallery has been heralded as the crowning jewel of downtown @entity73 's revival , and will house works by some of the most prominent artists of recent decades , including @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			1
@entity121 the @entity121 have never really had their moment in the spotlight , but a dance with darkness in 2015 may finally put the remote archipelago between @entity127 and @entity128 on travelers ' radars			0
this self - governing country within the @entity132 is one of just two places in the world that will witness a total solar eclipse on march 20 , 2015 , when the moon passes between the earth and sun , plunging daylight into darkness			1
several travel agencies are already filling up tours and cruises to the storybook isles for this once in a lifetime astronomical event			0
though it 'll last just 2 minutes and 47 seconds , @entity146 wo n't see anything like it again until 2026			0
@entity150 , @entity151 @entity152 and @entity153 ( @entity153 ) have long served as the two pinnacles of @entity151 's tourism duopoly , but an increasing number of visitors are venturing further south along the @entity158 to explore the " underground town " of @entity150 , where 80 % of the world 's opal comes from			0
@entity150 will celebrate its @entity162 in 2015 with a year 's worth of events , including an opal festival , gem show , marathon , dances and street parties			1
tourists heading into town for the celebrations will have the opportunity to sleep as the locals do in subterranean dugouts that promise a consistent temperature of 25 @entity176 )			0
there will , perhaps , be nowhere else on earth in 2015 where you can shop for bargain - basement gems , march in a street parade and retire to your underground hotel room ... all in one day			1
@entity185 @entity185 has a reputation for being pretty and dull in equal measure			2
however , the undeniably attractive isle of @entity185 will be anything but boring in 2015 as it celebrates 50 years of independence with fireworks , parades , shows , youth rallies and a new walkway from the @entity195 to @entity196			1
yet , @entity185 's @entity197 is n't the only reason to visit in 2015			1
the long - awaited @entity200 will finally open to the public in november and join recently unveiled attractions like @entity202 and the massive @entity203 in diversifying the city 's offerings			1
@entity206 , @entity207 what if you could visit the @entity209 and @entity210 within the course of one afternoon ? that , in essence , is what 's on offer in @entity216 , a dusty patch of @entity207 where the country bumps up against @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221			0
@entity206 is home to colorful colonial towns , gnarled mountainscapes and the highest altitude wineries in the world			0
with a $ 160 million plan underway to turn this largely domestic destination into the eco-tourism capital of @entity231 , this is a cat that 's about to be let out of the bag			0
if you like your wine with a side of adventure -- and want to take advantage of @entity207 's exceedingly favorable " blue dollar " exchange rate -- @entity206 will be ready and waiting in 2015			2
@entity241 the @entity242 has left the planet with many icons -- the @entity245 , the @entity246 , the first @entity247 -- but the legacy of @entity249 will likely be in the ideas it generates , rather than any architectural marvels			0
travelers from around the world are expected to converge on @entity256 's second - largest city between may and october to ruminate on the future of food within a 1.1 million - square - meter fairgrounds plotted out like a classical @entity261 metropolis			2
the event promises to put participants from more than 140 counties in touch with an estimated 20 million visitors across 60 pavilions , a record number exceeding even the 2010 @entity242 in @entity269			0
expect exotic food tastings , educational lectures and rich , multi-sensory experiences			0
@entity274 and @entity275 rivers small cruise vessels have long been a staple of @entity146 rivers , but with river cruising ballooning into the fastest - growing segment of the travel industry ( according to industry reports ) , many boats will find new homes in 2015 along two of @entity288 's most important waterways : the @entity274 and @entity275 rivers			1
more than a dozen new ships from a half - dozen companies ( including @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 ) will set sail in 2015 on journeys through @entity296 or across the @entity299 - @entity298 border from @entity300 to @entity301			2
for those who always wanted to see @entity288 , but did n't want to deal with the hassle of tuk - tuks and touts , there 's never been an easier ( or more comfortable ) way			2
@entity308 @entity309 may have exploded into a theme park of superlatives , but its oil - rich neighbor @entity308 has steered a different course in a multibillion - dollar bid to become the cultural capital of the @entity316			2
at the heart of @entity308 's reinvention is the 24,000 - square - meter @entity319			2
this intellectual playground is set to house the @entity321 in 2017 , the @entity322 in 2016 and , if all goes according to plan , the first @entity324 outside @entity325 by the end of next year			0
add to the mix a performing arts center designed by @entity329 , and it 's clear that both the skyline and city below are about to get a lot more inspiring			0
@entity334 is a freelance travel and culture writer based in @entity337 , @entity220			0
you can follow his adventures at @entity340 .			0

as the @entity57 , @entity49 , @entity50 , will host more than 1,000 cultural and artistic events in 2015
