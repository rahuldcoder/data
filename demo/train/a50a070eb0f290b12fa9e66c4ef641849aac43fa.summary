@entity0 -- a week ago , the genocide trial of former @entity4 dictator @entity3 appeared headed to a historic conclusion			1
today , it is at a standstill , the result of procedural missteps that have cast uncertainty over the process			0
the country 's @entity12 on tuesday began to answer some of the legal questions that are holding up the trial			1
but the biggest one -- whether the trial proceedings will be annulled -- remains to be clarified			1
@entity0 confronts a dark chapter the court ruled that the case file must be transferred from the judge who was overseeing the trial to another judge who at one time had been on the case but was removed			1
the new judge in charge of the case , @entity29 , is the same judge who last week ruled that all of the testimony heard in the trial is annulled and that the proceedings should revert to a pretrial phase			1
the plaintiffs appealed that ruling and are awaiting the decision of the @entity12			1
the charges against @entity3 , who ruled @entity0 from 1982 to 1983 , are considered historic because it is the first time a former head of state has been tried for genocide by the country 's own justice system			1
@entity3 and his then - intelligence chief , @entity42 , are accused of responsibility in the killings of more than 1,700 indigenous @entity45			0
@entity3 's defense has argued that the leader never ordered the extermination of the @entity49			2
for more than three weeks , the trial moved at a fast pace under judge @entity52 , with dozens of witnesses testifying each day			0
dozens of @entity45 told of brutal killings and rapes that they suffered , stories that often left those watching the proceedings with their jaws dropped			0
@entity3 's attorneys presented their case , too , saying there is no record anywhere of him ordering the killings of @entity49			1
the @entity67 subgroup was not singled out for its ethnicity , the lawyers said			0
the trial was nearing closing arguments when @entity29 put the brakes on it with her ruling on the invalidity of the testimony			0
the three - judge @entity77 panel overseeing the proceedings had pushed forward with the trial despite unresolved objections to procedures in lower courts			2
@entity29 ruled that because all of the issues at the lower courts had not been settled , the current proceedings were invalid			0
judge nullifies testimony in @entity0 genocide trial the case is back in @entity29 ' hands , but until the @entity12 rules on the appeal , it is not a certainty that the case will revert to its pretrial phase			1
it is still possible that the trial will pick up where it left off , but with @entity29 now as judge			0
other related rulings that the @entity12 handed down on tuesday , however , point to how complicated untangling the legal web is			2
the court ruled that the trial court had erred by dismissing one of @entity3 's attorneys during the first day of the trial			0
the @entity12 also said the court erred by ordering lawyers for @entity3 's co-defendant to defend the former leader , too			1
@entity3 came to power in a coup and led a military junta while @entity0 was in a bloody civil war between the army and leftist guerrillas			2
the war did not end until 1996 , leaving more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million as refugees			0
