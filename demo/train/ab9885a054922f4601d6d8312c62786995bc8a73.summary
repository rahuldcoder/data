@entity0 -- from the ninth floor of an office building here , @entity3 executives peered out of a window at the breathtaking view of the @entity9			1
behind them , baristas wrestled with an espresso maker and served up free cappuccinos to guests			0
the newly renovated office , located in @entity16 , @entity0 's tech hub , is home to the @entity19 , which opened last month			1
big and small software developers are invited to work here at no charge , with unlimited access to development phones , wireless equipment , shielded test rooms and lattes			0
the modern workspace is part of @entity19 's plan to improve its image in the technology industry and particularly with people who develop mobile phone apps , executives said in interviews			1
app makers often condemn carriers for monthly data caps and limits on high - bandwidth apps , which they see as stifling innovation			1
cell giants , including @entity45 and @entity47 's @entity46 , are taking approaches similar to @entity19 's to deflect criticism and position themselves as friends , not foes , of developers			1
@entity46 , which partially owns @entity3 , opened its own development center in @entity55 this month			1
@entity45 cut the ribbon last week on its @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59			1
all of the furniture there is on wheels to facilitate makeshift meetings			0
currently , 106 projects are under way at the foundry , many of them in collaboration with other companies			0
" the purpose here was really to be right in the middle of @entity55 , in the heart of innovation , " @entity70 , an @entity45 technology executive , said last week			1
" the one thing that we are extremely passionate about is enabling innovation through these partnerships and within this community			0
" @entity45 also is working with esteemed venture capital firms @entity81 and @entity82 to identify small companies with which the carrier should work , @entity70 said			1
third - party developers are welcome to show up at the foundry unannounced and receive technical support from people there , he said			0
an @entity45 spokeswoman declined to say how many workers staff its facility , but @entity70 said @entity94 has employees there along with @entity45 engineers , and that people from @entity99 and @entity100 will also work there intermittently			1
@entity94 is also a founding partner in @entity19 's innovation - center program			1
a @entity19 spokesman said 25 engineers work at its @entity0 office			1
@entity19 previously launched a similar facility in @entity108 , @entity109 , for hardware developers			1
@entity45 opened two others earlier this year in @entity112 , @entity113 , and @entity114 , @entity115			1
work at these centers has resulted in exclusive projects for each company , executives said			0
part of the motivation for the significant investments is to avoid being seen as a " dumb pipe , " or as solely a conduit for data , said @entity127 , a @entity128 analyst			0
" i think the long - term goal for a lot of these carriers is they do n't want to become pipes , " @entity127 said			2
" when you think about it , the carriers do n't bring a lot to a developer			0
" there may be technical limits to what developers can accomplish with these new carrier - specific app stores			0
telecoms operate many parts of their business as " a closed loop , " rather than unlocking services such as text messaging to developers , said @entity151 , a @entity152 product director			0
the carriers will have a tougher time convincing software makers , especially those who produce hot consumer apps , to sign exclusivity contracts , @entity127 said			2
" if you 've got a really compelling app , why are you going to limit yourself to half your potential market ? " @entity127 said			0
" you are not going to tie yourself to a carrier			0
" @entity19 and @entity45 executives acknowledged as much in interviews			1
developers who use their facilities likely will offer their apps on competitors ' networks , they said			0
" no one has a monopoly on good ideas , " @entity3 ceo @entity170 said at the center 's opening last month			2
@entity19 appears to be winning good will with smaller tech companies , however , which could be a valuable asset			2
some developers , who , according to @entity19 tech exec @entity180 , saw @entity19 as " the big , bad carrier , " changed their outlook after meetings at the new office			2
" the partners started saying , ' you guys are so open , ' " he said			0
@entity189 has attributed some of its successes in the mobile industry to a massive base of support from developers			0
@entity19 cto @entity196 said in an interview last month that people in the wireless industry see @entity189 as the impetus for renewed interest in @entity55			1
@entity189 has been holding an annual summer developers conference for more than two decades			0
@entity45 had its fifth annual developer summit in january on the eve of the @entity205			2
@entity19 wrapped up its third last week in @entity207			2
" we recognized from the beginning , " said @entity19 's @entity196 , " that the potential for innovation is bigger than @entity19			2
