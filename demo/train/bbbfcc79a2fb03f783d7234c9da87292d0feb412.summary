-- researchers at @entity3 's engineering school have come up with a novel way to cool the stadiums ahead of the @entity6 ... giant flying saucers ! actually , they have announced plans to develop giant artificial remotely controlled " clouds " made up of high - tech materials that will be positioned between the blistering sun and the still - to - be - built football stadiums in the @entity15 emirate			1
dr. @entity16 , head of a @entity18 and @entity17 at @entity3 , tells @entity0 that the artificial robotic cloud could potentially drop the temperatures on the pitch by 10 degrees @entity22			1
that 's a big deal in a country where temperatures in summer regularly soar into triple - digits @entity22 -- the very time the 2022 tournament is expected to take place			0
@entity16 says that the design has passed the initial engineering phase and his team plan to make a 4 - by - 3 meter prototype by the end of this year to test the concept			1
the finished product would be a rectangle made up of carbon fiber and solar panels the size of a jumbo jet			0
it would use sophisticated monitoring gear to track the transit of the sun and would use four electric powered engines to maneuver to the precisely the right position to drop a cool shade across the stadiums			0
@entity16 believes that the technology could also be useful in security and communications			2
radio and camera transmitters could help facilitate wireless communication and provide an eye - in - the - sky for broadcasters or security forces			0
his team eventually hopes to construct the helium - filled devices in @entity61 , and the final price for each unit could be as low as $ 500,000 , @entity16 predicted .			2

@entity6 comes to @entity61 in 2022
@entity16 of @entity3 said he plans to make a prototype of the robot cloud
the robot cloud will be used to create shade
