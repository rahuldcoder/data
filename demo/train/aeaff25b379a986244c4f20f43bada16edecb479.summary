-- it 's time to end the posturing and give the world 's boxing fans the bout they desperately want : @entity6 versus @entity7			1
that 's @entity9 's message to everyone involved in trying to navigate a way through the quagmire that is negotiations for a contest that has long been top of fight fans ' wish list			1
@entity6 's promoter has been in touch with @entity7 's camp to kick - start talks and finally attempt to get two of boxing 's best ever fighters in the ring			1
though both boxers are arguably past their prime any match up between @entity7 -- unbeaten in 45 fights across five different weights -- and @entity6 -- an eight - division world champion with 55 wins from 62 fights -- is likely to ignite huge interest			1
" we 've put out the olive branch saying we would welcome the start of discussions for such a fight , " @entity34 chief executive officer @entity9 told @entity35			1
" while @entity6 fights on @entity44 and @entity44 pay - per - view and @entity7 fights on @entity45 and @entity45 pay - per - view , there is a precedent for both networks to come together and put on big event			1
" they did it when heavyweight @entity51 , who was a @entity45 fighter , fought @entity52 , who was an @entity44 fighter , a number of years ago			0
that was a hugely successful event and set a record for pay - per - view sales in the @entity57			0
" we ca n't keep posturing ,			0
if people want to make a deal and put aside egos and making statements to the press -- who was right , who was wrong -- and really sincerely want something to happen it generally gets done			1
" and it is my hope that 's what will happen ; when and if both sides sit down to discuss seriously an event the sports world is crying out for			1
" with @entity7 approaching 37 and @entity6 , 34 , suffering two successive defeats before his most recent victory -- over @entity77 in @entity78 -- @entity9 acknowledges time is running out to make a deal			1
while the pair may not be as the pinnacle of their careers as they were when the fight was mooted three years ago , @entity9 still believes it would generate worldwide interest and reportedly might bring in $ 100 million			1
" i think if an event like that was made people would really flock to watch it , " he added			0
" i think it 's very fair to say the clamor is not as fervent as it was a few years ago when they were both at the height of their careers but it 's still an event the public are clamoring for , perhaps not as much as three years ago but we ca n't roll back the clock			2
" @entity6 's most immediate focus in the aftermath of his victory over @entity77 earlier this month has been to defend himself amid accusations that he owes $ 50 million in unpaid taxes in his home country the @entity106			1
the 34 - year - old 's assets have been frozen , meaning he had to borrow money to help victims of @entity110 that tore through the country			2
but @entity9 says the allegations amount to a " political vendetta " against @entity6 , who is a member of congress in the @entity106 , and will be ironed out shortly			1
" the assessment is based on fights he had in the @entity57 and in every one of those fights -- four fights in the two years in question -- we withheld 30 % of the amounts we paid him and paid those amounts to the @entity125 ( @entity125 ) , " @entity9 explained			2
" we supplied the @entity106 tax authorities with the schedule of our payments and receipts from the @entity125			2
for some unknown reason they are insisting the @entity125 send certification of the payments			0
" @entity6 applied for those certifications a while ago and of course the @entity125 was bogged down partly because when the government was shut down they were n't working			2
there 's been a hold up but i 'm sure once those certifications arrive , it will all go away			0
" he does n't owe anything			0
under the @entity106 - @entity57 tax treaty , he was taxed in the @entity57 for income earned in the @entity57 , and he gets a dollar per dollar credit against his @entity106 taxes			0
" once that credit it given to him they 'll find there is no further tax liability in the @entity106			0
" i think it 's great for his image because it shows the nature of politics in the @entity106			0
@entity6 is a member of a coalition in the @entity106 that is in political opposition to the president and it seems to me as a foreigner , that this is nothing more than a political vendetta			2
" @entity9 hailed @entity6 's showdown with @entity77 in @entity78 , a province of @entity168 , as a triumph and said he is planning another event with three former olympic gold medalists in february			1
along with the emergence of fighters from @entity174 and @entity175 , as well as the traditional boxing heartlands of the @entity57 and the @entity177 , @entity9 pointed to @entity178 as having huge potential			1
" is @entity178 an up and coming market for everything ? of course it is , " he said			0
" there 's 1.3 billion people in @entity168 , there 's fans all over @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189			0
there 's tremendous interest in boxing and we expect to do many events in the years to come in @entity178			2
" there will be a lot of talent in @entity178 fighters just as there are so many great fighters now coming out of @entity175 , from @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203			0
" boxing is a world wide sport and our best fighters and champions are coming from all over			0
i 'm very , very excited as far as the future of boxing is concerned			0
