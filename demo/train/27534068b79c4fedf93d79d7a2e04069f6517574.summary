-- a legal fight is under way in @entity3 that could decide if the socially conservative state legalizes same - sex marriage			1
a county clerk in suburban @entity7 has given nearly 100 same - sex couples marriage licenses , even though the state bans same - sex marriage			1
@entity11 , the elected register of wills in @entity14 , has been doing this for about a month , and the state @entity16 is now taking him to court to try to make him stop			1
the case could lead to a reversal of the state 's version of the @entity23 , or @entity23 , if a judge were to side with @entity11 in finding that the ban on same - sex marriage contradicts the state 's constitution			1
in june , in the case @entity29 v. @entity30 , the @entity29 @entity28 struck down a key part of @entity23 , which defined marriage as only between a man and a woman			1
@entity11 told @entity0 that about four weeks ago , he was approached by a lesbian couple wanting a marriage license			0
instead of immediately saying " no , " @entity11 and his solicitor reviewed the state 's constitution and decided that language about civil rights , happiness and liberty applied to same - sex couples who want to get married			1
" we 've either got to change the constitution -- permit discrimination on the basis of sex , permit civil rights to be frustrated -- or change the interpretation of that marriage act or change the marriage act			2
you ca n't have it both ways , " he said			0
@entity11 has received dozens of thank - you cards , and his office benches are filling up with same - sex couples driving from across the state to get marriage licenses			1
but not everyone is on board			0
the state filed a petition to make him stop , citing a law passed by the state legislature in 1996 that defines marriage as " between one man and one woman			1
" at least one lawmaker says @entity11 has gone rogue			0
" he 's a lowly elected official in a county office who is not elected to set policy , but to administer the law as it 's been passed , " state lawmaker @entity71 , a @entity72 , said friday			2
" for a man to start violating the law as he has and commit such a lawless act should be offensive to everyone , no matter what side of the issue you 're on			0
" @entity71 says he believes the marriage licenses are invalid			1
" it does n't matter how many licenses he issues , they 're not worth the paper he 's printing them on , " he said			2
he also said he 's drafting legislation to have the state 's attorney general , @entity90 , impeached because she said she believed she could n't defend the state 's version of @entity23			1
his legislation will be introduced when the state legislature returns in september			0
@entity71 is also calling for @entity96 to be impeached and says he 's gotten a lot of support			0
the petition filed by the @entity16 states that @entity11 is in " direct defiance " of that law and that he " risks causing serious and limitless harm to the public			2
" @entity105 is not commenting on the case , since her office is n't handling the petition			0
but earlier this year , she said she came to the same conclusion as @entity11 : the state 's version of @entity23 conflicted with the state constitution			1
" @entity23 is wholly unconstitutional			2
it can not be fixed , " she said in early july when the @entity115 sued @entity3 after the @entity29 @entity28 ruled on the @entity30 case			2
@entity117 , a prominent @entity3 civil and criminal attorney , says this is exactly the kind of case that could end up deciding the fate of same - sex marriage in the state			1
laws , he said , are made this way all the time			0
" the issue is going to be whether or not a reading of the constitution can be read to override the state law ban on marriages , " @entity117 said			0
" the state @entity28 in @entity3 could review this and strike down the state ban			2
" in the meantime , it 's unclear whether same - sex couples with marriage licenses in the state would qualify for benefits			1
but for now , @entity117 says , @entity3 has become the 14th state to have legal same - sex marriages			1
@entity11 says he does n't see himself as a crusader -- just an elected official doing his job			0
" in the ordinary course of business , two people are coming into my office , sitting on a bench , waiting to get a marriage license , and they 're getting those marriage licenses regardless of their gender , " he said			2
" this is the way it ought to be , and that 's the way i would like it to be			0
" one thank - you note that arrived at his office reads , " if possible i would like to have your autograph			0
" " that 's interesting , " @entity11 said			0
" i have n't done that			0
