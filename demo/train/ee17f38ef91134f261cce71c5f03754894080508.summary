@entity1 , which has endured a difficult start to the season under new manager @entity14 , was held to a disappointing draw at @entity16 in the @entity17 at the weekend			1

more goals " we could have scored more , " @entity25 told @entity26			2
" but we ca n't be too greedy			2

" going into a game knowing a win puts us through is a carrot and the five goals and a clean sheet is a bonus			0
" @entity38 gave @entity1 the lead midway through the first half before an own goal from @entity42 doubled the visiting team 's advantage			1
@entity45 , @entity46 and @entity48 winger @entity47 added further strikes after the interval			0
" there were so many good performances , " @entity1 manager @entity14 told @entity26			1
" to come to @entity55 and get a such a good result , @entity8 are second in the @entity57 behind @entity58 , it gives an idea of where our performance and result stood			1
" [ the performance ] was what i was hoping to get more often , there have been signs we are getting better but also signs we have been wasteful as well			0
" top spot @entity1 still requires a point from its final fixture against @entity72 to secure top spot in @entity74 @entity72 still boasts aspirations of claiming top spot after it defeated @entity77 4 - 0 in @entity78			1
but it will have to beat @entity1 at @entity79 to win the group , while @entity8 must beat @entity77 and hope @entity72 fail to win			1
the defeat was @entity8 's first at home in 14 games since losing 2 - 1 to @entity58 in the @entity57 back in march			1
" when you conceded five goals , there is n't much more to say , " @entity8 striker @entity84 told reporters			0
" we should never have allowed them so many chances to shoot			0
" real deal meanwhile , @entity92 also qualified for the next stage following a 4 - 1 home win over @entity95			1
deprived of its injured talisman @entity96 , @entity77 's night threatened to unravel following the sending off of defender @entity97			0
but goals from @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 secured all three points			0
" the team was very , very good in the second half , " @entity100 told @entity104			0
" the coach was exactly right in the tactical changes he made and we were able to press them higher up the pitch			0
" @entity95 can still make it through to the last - 16 but it must defeat @entity113 in its final group game			1
@entity113 needs just a point to take second place after it saw off @entity117 3 - 1 thanks to a hat - trick from @entity120			1
@entity122 class also through to the next stage is @entity124 , which left it late to see off @entity126 2 - 1 in the @entity128 capital			1
despite being reduced to 10 men when @entity130 was sent off , @entity124 prevailed thanks to goals from @entity133 and @entity134			1
@entity126 must now beat @entity135 on december 10 and hope that @entity136 fails to claim maximum points against @entity124 if it is to progress			1
@entity136 edged out @entity135 3 - 2 in @entity138 with @entity139 netting a 90th minute winner			0
record run elsewhere , defending champion @entity58 set a new @entity5 record after winning a 10th consecutive game			1
the @entity55 side defeated @entity146 3 - 1 in @entity147 to eclipse the previous record of nine straight wins by @entity150 , which recorded the feat in 2002 - 3			2
" getting 10 wins in a row is very hard and i am proud of my players , the club and everyone involved , " @entity58 manager @entity152 told reporters			2
@entity159 fired @entity58 ahead on 17 minutes before @entity160 netted a stylish second			2
@entity162 pulled a goal back from the penalty spot just after the hour mark only for @entity166 to net @entity58 's third			2
" it is a fantastic achievement to win 10 consecutive games in @entity29 especially if you consider we also played @entity150 and then @entity173 on the way to the final ( last season ) , " @entity159 told reporters			0
" we have said we do n't play for records , we play to win titles			0
but we have a great team and i am proud to be part of it			0
" city slickers in the group 's other game , @entity183 eased to a 4 - 2 win over @entity188 side @entity187			0
