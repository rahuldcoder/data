anyone who knows real estate is likely familiar with the old adage about the things that matter in property : location			0
but in @entity8 , with a population of more than 8 million , finding a good spot for the right price can be tricky			0
so @entity13 's mayor is looking for help			0
@entity15 on monday called on designers to come up with a proposal for a @entity19 apartment building made up mostly of " micro-units , " defined as rentals with 275 to 300 square feet of living space			1
@entity15 's soda ban proposal goes to public comment submissions are due september 14 , and winners will be chosen at the end of 2012 , with the first micro-units to be developed by late 2013			1
for @entity8 accustomed to cramped quarters and others pushed beyond city limits due to cost , the pilot program may be something to consider			2
" today there are about 1.8 million one - and two - person households in our city , but there are only about 1 million studio and one - bedroom apartments , " @entity15 told reporters monday			1
" you notice the mismatch			0
" the pilot units will be required to fill at least 75 % of the building			0
they 'll have kitchens and bathrooms , but are far smaller than current city minimums of 450 square feet			1
" @entity8 's housing codes have not kept up with its changing population , " the mayor 's press release said			0
" there is a huge shortfall of studio and one - bedroom apartments in the city , " @entity15 added			2
" this ... will be one way to make more of them , and to make more of them more affordable			0
" the units will likely be priced under $ 2,000 a month , which is the average market rent for a studio apartment in @entity19 , according to city @entity66 and development commissioner @entity68			1
but for those used to stretching out , the new units may be a bit tight			0
" it can fit a twin size bed , maybe a small nightstand , a small dining table for two , and that 's pretty much it , " said @entity72 , ceo of @entity73 , an independent appraisal firm			0
" a master bedroom of a modest ranch home equipped with a bathroom would probably be the equivalent			0
" micro-units will equate to about 15 % of the size of the average @entity87 home , he added , which spans about 2,200 to 2,400 square feet			1

considered one of the world 's most densely populated areas , more than 69,000 people on average occupy each square mile of @entity19 , according to the latest census data			1
the program 's first micro-units are to be built on a vacant lot owned by the @entity112 , and are part of a city initiative to create or preserve 165,000 affordable housing units by 2014			2
