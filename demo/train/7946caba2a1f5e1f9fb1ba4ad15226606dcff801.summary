-- @entity3 - @entity2 tensions flared again in @entity4 on wednesday , with police and youths clashing at one of the holiest sites in @entity9 and @entity10 , and a @entity2 motorist slamming into pedestrians , killing one			1
the events occurred amid unrest spurred in part by a days long war of words -- and sometimes rocks and bullets -- over the compound called the @entity22 by @entity23 and @entity22 , or the @entity22 , by @entity24			1
at the compound -- the holiest site in @entity9 and the third - holiest in @entity10 -- groups of @entity2 youths threw stones and set off fireworks at @entity3 police officers when the site was opened to visitors , @entity3 police spokeswoman @entity25 said			1
clashes left more than 15 people injured , police said			1
it was just the latest round of unrest since right - wing activist rabbi @entity42 was shot and gravely wounded after championing more @entity23 rights at the site , where @entity23 can currently gather , but not pray			0
the october 29 shooting helped to ratchet up tensions in @entity4 and prompted @entity3 authorities to close the holy site for one day -- a move that a spokesman for @entity2 president @entity51 called a " declaration of war			1
" before wednesday 's violence , the youths had gathered at the site 's @entity56 overnight , amassing rocks , fireworks and @entity60 with which to attack police , @entity25 said			0
police pushed the @entity2 back into the mosque during wednesday 's clashes , @entity25 said , and , in an attempt to control the violence , police temporarily closed access to the compound			1
witnesses among the @entity24 worshipers gave a different version of events , saying police tossed stun grenades into the mosque to clear the way for @entity23 protesters intending to support @entity42			1
" inside the mosque they formed obstacles to hide behind , " @entity25 said			0
" there were violent clashes with the police			1
" police later allowed @entity23 and tourists back to the site , but unrest flared again near another gate , when police threw stun grenades and fired rubber bullets at @entity24 worshipers who were chanting and praying because they were n't allowed back into the compound			0
paramedics from the @entity95 said 15 people were injured , one of them with a serious injury to the eye			1
@entity25 said police officers were injured			2

police shot and killed the attacker , identified by @entity3 authorities as a member of the @entity117 @entity116 movement and a resident of the @entity120 @entity2 refugee camp in eastern @entity4 , @entity25 said			1
news of the attack and subsequent killing ignited fierce clashes between @entity3 security forces and @entity2 youths at the entrance of the refugee camp , according to witnesses			1
police did not say the van attack was tied to unrest at the holy site			0
no motive was immediately released , but the @entity117 movement @entity116 supported it in a text message to the news media : " @entity116 blesses the action			0
what is happening in @entity4 is pushing us to prepare for war			0
" @entity3 police spokesman @entity142 called the incident " a terrorist attack			1
" that was followed later in the day by a similar incident , when a car with @entity2 plates rammed into @entity3 military post near @entity151 in the @entity152 , injuring three @entity3 soldiers , authorities said			1
police are searching for the driver , who appears to have fled the scene , they said			2
the soldiers were taken to @entity4 's @entity159			0
all three are in moderate condition , dr. @entity160 , the hospital 's deputy head , said			1
earlier , @entity25 said one was in critical condition			0
prime minister @entity166 condemned what he said was the " incitement " of violence by @entity2 leaders			2
he said the assassination attempt on @entity172 has led to other violence , including the vehicle attack			0
the attack comes on the heels of two hit - and - run incidents that happened in @entity4 and the @entity152 last month			0
on october 22 , a @entity2 man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in @entity4 , killing a baby and wounding several other people , @entity3 police said			1
@entity2 state news reported that a 5 - year - old girl died october 19 after an @entity3 settler deliberately ran over her as she returned home from kindergarten near a village to the north of @entity192 in the @entity152			1
recent tension at the holy site some of the recent tension centers on the @entity22 / @entity22 and @entity42 , who has argued that @entity23 must have a place of worship there			2
@entity3 police shot and killed a suspect in @entity42 's shooting			1
that is a sensitive issue for @entity24 , who suspect a plan to expel them from the site			0
a spokesman for the military wing of @entity116 said the site 's @entity56 " is the detonator needed to ignite a volcano in the face of the cowardly and treacherous occupier			0
" " we salute the heroes of the mujahideen of @entity116 , " @entity212 said in a message posted on the military wing 's website			0
@entity219 controlled the site for a time until 1967 , when @entity3 seized eastern @entity4			2
in the 1980s , @entity23 radicals plotted to blow up the @entity24 buildings , believing that it would lead to a spiritual revolution and usher in the messiah			0
in 2000 , the @entity226 -- a five - year @entity2 uprising -- was sparked , @entity2 say , after @entity227 , then a candidate for @entity3 prime minister , visited the compound surrounding the @entity56			1
@entity227 insisted that his visit was not intended to provoke @entity2 , but many saw it as an attempt to underline @entity3 's claim to @entity4 's holy sites			1
revered by @entity23 , @entity24 with its golden dome overlooking @entity4 , the @entity22 / haram al - sharif site is said to have hosted sacred events in the @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity242 religions			2
rabbinic sages say that @entity244 gathered dust from this spot to create @entity247 , the first man , before setting him loose in the @entity248			0
@entity23 tradition holds that the @entity22 contains @entity250 , where @entity251 , the @entity252 patriarch , is said to have nearly sacrificed his son -- under @entity244 's orders -- before an angel intervened			2
later , @entity3 @entity256 constructed the first @entity23 temple on the mount , including the @entity259 , a room that kept the @entity261 , which was said to contain the tablets on which @entity244 wrote the @entity263			2
at the foot of the @entity22 , the 62 - foot - tall @entity265 , or @entity265 , stands			2
once supporting the courtyard of the ancient temple , @entity23 gather there now to hold religious services , to pray or to slip notes into its cracks			0
for @entity24 , the @entity22 contains one of the most sacred sites in @entity10 : the @entity56			2
@entity24 believe that the @entity275 was carried on a flying steed from @entity277 to the site during his miraculous @entity279 , said @entity280 , an expert on @entity10 and politics at the @entity282			0
according to @entity10 tradition , the night journey took @entity275 to the same @entity4 rock on which @entity251 nearly sacrificed his son , where the @entity24 founder led @entity251 , @entity287 and @entity288 in prayers as the last of @entity244 's prophets			0
that rock is now said to sit in the @entity291 , its golden roof gleaming above the @entity294 skyline			0
since @entity24 began construction at the site in the seventh century , @entity22 , now controlled by an @entity10 trust , has been an almost constant source of tension between @entity24 and @entity23			2
