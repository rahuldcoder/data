-- the @entity1 have always featured an awkward mix of high ideals and crass , even brutal , political calculation			1
the @entity1 have provided countless moments of inspiration , not only about personal achievement but , more importantly , about breaking down the barriers that push apart countries and individuals			1
the @entity1 , however , have also reminded us how far human beings can stray from those ideals			2
the most chilling , frightening and heartbreaking moment at any @entity1 came 40 years ago , at the @entity16 , when nearly a dozen @entity18 athletes were taken hostage and killed in what was a terrorist attack by any definition of the term			1
in addition to the athletes and trainers , a @entity24 policeman and five @entity26 kidnappers died that september day			2
now , that tragedy has become the source of more disheartening behavior , this time by officials of the @entity34 , who adamantly refuse to mark the anniversary of that dark day with a simple moment of silence			1
the @entity38 was an open assault on the most fundamental principles the @entity1 purport to embrace : " the harmonious development of humankind ... a peaceful society [ and ] the preservation of human dignity			2
" the attack was carried out by members of the @entity26 group @entity46 , and their targets were obviously the @entity18			2
but honoring the victims should have nothing to do with @entity18			2
in a letter to @entity34 president @entity51 , @entity53 's ministers of foreign affairs @entity54 and sports minister @entity55 explained it best when they wrote , " the terrorist attack targeted not only @entity18 , but the spirit and goals of the @entity1 movement ... it should be marked publicly as part of the official ceremony			1
... " for more than three decades , the families of those killed in the attack have tried to have the @entity1 honor their loved ones during the opening ceremonies			2
incredibly , the @entity34 has steadfastly refused that very simple request			2
@entity1 officials claim -- quite falsely -- that they would never mix politics with the games			1
but that is clearly not the real reason			0
the real reason is cowardice			0
politics have always been part of the games , and very deliberately			2
in 1908 , @entity78 was banned from displaying its own flag , for fear of offending @entity81			0
the losers of both @entity83 and @entity84 were kept out of the games			0
we know that @entity87 used the @entity88 to promote his ideas of @entity91 superiority , and we know the @entity92 and the @entity93 boycotted the games for political reasons			0
in 2008 , the @entity34 disgracefully agreed to let @entity97 block access to internet sites in the @entity100 games			1
examples of politicization of the @entity1 abound			2
but now , somehow the murder of @entity18 has become unmentionable , under the flimsy excuse that it would inject politics into the pristine @entity1			1
the real reason is simple : @entity1 officials are afraid to upset countries with anti-israel and @entity110 sentiment			1
that is misguided and shameful			0
standing against the slaying of @entity1 athletes has nothing to do with the politics of the @entity116			1
@entity1 officials have admitted they are afraid to trigger a walkout of @entity119 countries			1
this is worse than giving in to blackmail			0
it is particularly egregious behavior since it comes from those claiming to stand for high humanistic ideals			0
ironically , an @entity18 member of the @entity34 revealed the concern when he said he , too , opposed the moment of silence , saying that " it could cause some countries to boycott the games			1
" this year , the campaign to honor the victims has mustered more support than ever , with several countries and tens of thousands of people around the world joining in the effort			0
the energy for the campaign originated with @entity141 , whose husband , @entity142 , was the fencing coach of the @entity18 @entity1 delegation in 1972			1
he left home with nothing but excitement to participate in the international celebration			0
he returned home in a coffin			0
@entity141 , who said , " @entity152 and revenge are not a part of me , " insisted she fervently believes in the @entity1 ideal			2
in a heartfelt video she requested support for what has become her life 's mission			0
already more than 90,000 people have signed the petition			0
but the @entity34 refuses to listen			1
@entity141 's daughter , @entity164 , who was just 2 months old when her father was killed in @entity166 , tried to have the moment marked at the @entity168 in @entity169			2
but @entity34 's director general @entity170 declared at the start of the games that the @entity34 does not " organize events that commemorate dramas that are long gone			1
" @entity164 said of @entity16 : " we just want one word from the @entity34 that this was n't just a regular @entity1 , that our fathers were killed there			1
" her request , like all the others , was denied			0
the ongoing petition for a moment of silence clearly states that this should not be a political moment			0
@entity141 and her supporters said all they want is silence			0
" silence is a fitting tribute for athletes who lost their lives on the @entity1 stage			1
silence contains no statements , assumptions or beliefs and requires no understanding of language to interpret			0
" they want recognition that what occurred took place " within the @entity1 family , " a sharing of their sorrow that will help ensure this never happens again			1
but the @entity34 apparently sees this as a purely @entity18 problem			1
@entity51 has attended memorial ceremonies , but usually they are organized by the @entity18 government			2
@entity51 has been hearing from all corners of the world			0
@entity24 foreign minister @entity216 supports the moment of silence			0
the parliaments of @entity53 and @entity220 voted unanimously to ask the @entity34 to agree to the request			0
@entity220 prime minister @entity222 wrote to @entity51 , officially asking for the moment of silence			0
@entity225 sport minister @entity224 also backs a moment of silence , saying , " one does not need to take a stand on the @entity18 - @entity26 question to find the events of september 1972 heinous			1
" in @entity232 , 125 mps also signed a letter to the @entity34 in support of the moment of silence			1
with the growing pressure , the chairman of the @entity237 , @entity238 , has reportedly said he will hold a personal memorial for the @entity18 athletes			1
nobody knows exactly what that means			0
perhaps the @entity246 committee will give the families of the @entity18 victims the recognition they want for their loved ones			0
even if they do , that will not remove the stain of cowardice now on display at the @entity34 , which remains visibly splashed across those @entity1 ideals they hypocritically claim to promote			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			0

@entity260 : most chilling moment at an @entity1 occurred in the 1972 @entity16
@entity263 : a dozen @entity18 athletes were taken hostage and murdered in an act of terrorism
she says @entity34 officials claim -- falsely -- that they would never mix politics with the games
@entity263 : it 's a *travesty* that the @entity34 refuses to mark the 40th anniversary of that dark day
