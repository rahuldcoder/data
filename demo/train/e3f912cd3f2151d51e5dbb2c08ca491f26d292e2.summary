-- the teen who stunned the world of tennis tuesday from @entity5 's @entity4 , beating @entity6 in an audacious , four - set victory laced with fun and brazen moves , has had his fairytale first @entity5 brought to an close			1
@entity12 ' run came to an abrupt halt wednesday , with @entity14 , the no. 8 seed from @entity16 , disposing of the young @entity17 , 6 - 7 6 - 2 6 - 4 7 - 6			1
but the 19 - year - old from @entity20 's achievement will live on as one of the shocks of the tournament			1
to meet tennis world number one @entity6 on the court at @entity5 in his first appearance there , and to not only triumph , but to do so with an assortment of tricks , including an opening ace and a sublime between - the - legs flick that left the @entity31 great dumbfounded , counts as a memorable introduction			1
" never did i think a week ago i was going to make the quarterfinals of @entity5 in my first appearance , " the wild - card entry , ranked 144 in the world , said in a press conference after taking this famous scalp			1
heightened expectations until his win over @entity6 , he was likely content to experience the tournament , play his @entity44 -- which he brought with him from @entity17 -- and hang out with his father and sister , who accompanied him to @entity47			2
he said he 'd text his mother a smiley face after the press event ended			0
now , expectations are somewhat heightened			0
on court , @entity12 carries himself confidence and verve that belies his 19 years of age , as his unorthodox , @entity6 - stumping shot clearly demonstrated			1
after besting the five - time finalist over four sets , the world has been alerted to @entity17 tennis ' worst - kept secret , a serial winner -- and world junior number 1 -- at youth level who is taking his senior career in his stride			2
many are tipping the right - handed , attacking baseliner as a future great of the game			0
it 's not an @entity17 fairytale without precedent , however			0
in 1996 , at another @entity79 event , a young @entity74 -- an @entity17 who also boasts @entity77 heritage -- knocked out then - number 1 @entity81 to reach the fourth round			0
" that 's what it reminded me of , where ( @entity12 ) just did n't go away -- he kept going for the shots and kept coming up with the goods , " @entity17 great @entity87 told the @entity88			2
" it was extremely impressive			0
" he started playing at six , and his background -- @entity77 - @entity17 on his father 's side and @entity100 on his mother 's -- is emblematic of multicultural , modern @entity17 , and currently divides his time between his hometown of @entity20 and @entity104 , the spiritual home of @entity17 tennis			2
he 's at home on grass -- something that can not necessarily be said for his erstwhile opponent , who has endured a torrid time at @entity5 in recent years			1
@entity114 comparison after his phenomenal win over @entity6 , comparisons are plenty , given the number of precocious talents who have graced @entity4			1
but perhaps the most flattering is with the great @entity114 , who as an unsmiling teutonic 17 - year old beat the @entity122 @entity121 in the 1985 final , the first of his three @entity5 titles			1
" we keep saying ' who 's the next guy ? ' and i think that we 've found that guy , '' former @entity5 champion and current commentator @entity125 told the @entity127			2
" it was absolutely stunning , what he did to the world number 1			0
" he absolutely believed that he was going to win this match , and he 's acting , to me , like he can win this tournament			0
the last guy i saw like this ... is @entity114			0
that young teenager , no fear whatsoever , no matter what comes my way i 'm going to be better than them			0
'' @entity125 's confidence in @entity12 ' ability to go all the way may have fallen flat for now , but for a 19 - year - old in his first pro season , defeating one of tennis ' all - time greats still counts as a remarkable success , and he will be relishing his return to the scene in a year 's time .			1
