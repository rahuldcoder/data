@entity0 -- taken alone , a @entity9 woman 's 20 - minute video " scrapbook " is basically a collection of photographic memories spanning her 19 - year - old daughter 's all - too - brief life			1
birthday parties , picnics , graduations -- all set to evocative music and narrated matter - of - factly by the mother			0
@entity17 was one of three justices who wanted to grant further review of the defendant 's case			1
what makes this video unusual is that it was presented at a @entity9 murder trial as " victim impact evidence			1
" the @entity28 on monday gave an indirect endorsement to such videos when it rejected an appeal from a defendant who argued that the presentation violated his right to a fair trial			1
the high court also rejected a similar capital case , also from @entity9 , involving a woman who narrated a video montage of her slain parents			1
with the court 's refusal to intervene , the death sentences imposed by the juries in the two cases were upheld			1
at issue was not whether any testimony can be used showing the impact a crime victim 's loss had on family , friends and society at large			1
the question for the justices was how that testimony is presented			0
some trial courts , but not all , have allowed such videotapes to be played in court , while often placing limitations on the content			0
one case involved @entity63 , convicted in the 1993 slaying of @entity65			1
the teenager had befriended @entity63 at a @entity68 gym			1
her body was found stabbed 29 times , probably by a pair of scissors			0
during the penalty phase of the trial , the prosecution presented just one witness to provide victim impact evidence : the victim 's mother , @entity78 , a @entity80 - area attorney			1
she had prepared the video , describing how her daughter had been adopted from @entity83 and was a @entity84			0
in the background is the music of @entity87 , an @entity88 singer and composer			0
most of the video simply describes the photos and home movies , but near the end is a shot of @entity97 's grave and @entity78 's narration : " as time goes by , i try very hard not to think of @entity65 in terms of this terrible tragedy that we 've had to deal with here in court , but rather of her in a place like this			2
" over photos of the @entity83 landscape , @entity78 concludes , " this is filmed in southern @entity110 , the land where @entity65 's people lived for so many generations			0
this is the kind of heaven she seems to belong in			0
" the trial judge had allowed the video to be presented , calling it a " very compelling tape " and adding that " it has more probative value than any prejudicial effect			2
" @entity63 appealed , saying the video so influenced the jury that the panel was unable to render a fair assessment of the penalty			1
@entity9 's highest court allowed the verdict and death penalty to stand , but urged judges to use caution in allowing such video evidence			1
@entity28 @entity17 , in a brief statement , said monday he would have accepted @entity63 's appeal of his sentence and held oral arguments on the issue			1
" the videos added nothing relevant to the jury 's deliberations , " he wrote , " and invited a verdict based on sentiment , rather than reasoned judgment			2
" but it takes four justices to grant further review of a case , and only justices @entity149 and @entity151 joined @entity17			2
@entity151 called the @entity63 video " poignant , tasteful , artistic and , above all , moving , " but he noted that was the problem			1
" those aspects of the film tell the jury little or nothing about the crime 's ' circumstances ' " the jury had to consider during sentencing			0
the companion case dealt with @entity163 , convicted in the february 1996 slayings of @entity165 , 79 , and his wife @entity166 , 74 , in the @entity168 area of @entity80			0
the defendant lived next door to the @entity171 and owed money to them			0
he robbed and stabbed the elderly couple , and a jury sentenced him to death			2
the @entity178 ' daughter , @entity177 , narrated 118 scenes from her parents ' life			0
the trial judge forbade the playing of accompanying audio , and instructed @entity177 not to make inflammatory comments , an order she complied with			0
courts around the country have offered differing rulings on the issue of such videos			0
juries in @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 have been allowed to see video of victims playing the piano , with their families at christmas time , and playing with their children			0
but a federal court in @entity204 barred a video of about 200 photos of a victim , set to @entity208 and @entity210 music			2
and a @entity212 court tossed out a murder conviction after a slain man 's father showed a video tribute , also with @entity87 music , during the penalty phase			2
the @entity28 in 1991 upheld the use of victim impact evidence , saying it balanced what the justices at the time said was almost unlimited mitigation evidence the defendant could offer			1
but the high court said such evidence has its limits			0
then - chief justice @entity229 wrote that a criminal defendant could seek judicial relief " in the event that evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair			2
" the justices in 2006 unanimously upheld the conviction of another @entity9 killer after the victim 's family members wore buttons with a picture of the slain man as they sat silently in front of jurors throughout the trial .			1

case involved case of @entity249 , stabbed to death in @entity9
@entity253 's mother , a lawyer , put together moving video scrapbook
defendant @entity63 contended video was prejudicial
justices rejected @entity63 's appeal , indirectly endorsing victim impact videos
