-- the shelling and sinking of a rust - stained fishing trawler in @entity5 waters ends its aimless voyage more than a year after a tsunami swept it off the east coast of @entity9			1
the @entity10 said it opened fire on the roughly 200 - foot trawler thursday after it determined the " unmanned , unlit , unmarked vessel " posed a hazard to mariners and @entity5 's marine environment			1
the @entity17 caught fire and capsized in more than 6,000 feet of water about 180 miles southwest of the port city of @entity21 , said @entity23 @entity22 , a @entity22 spokesman			1
it was a dramatic end for the @entity9 squid trawler			2
it was bound for a scrap yard before becoming part of a giant debris field generated by a tsunami that struck the island nation following a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake on march 11 , 2011			1
" it 's really one of the first significant pieces of tsunami debris to make its way across the @entity38 , " @entity22 said			2
the ship drifted undetected until late last month when a @entity41 coastal air patrol spotted it several hundred miles off the @entity43 , an archipelago on the north coast of @entity46			2
it captured the imagination of the public , which followed the final days of " the ghost ship " in media reports and tracked its progress on @entity41 and @entity10 websites			1
" i think it captured a lot of people because it survived			0
it was swept away by the tsunami			0
and it spends an entire year at sea , a summer , a winter and it makes it all the way across the @entity38 , " @entity22 said			0
the @entity9 coast guard identified the trawler and its owner after @entity41 officials provided the identification number on the hull of the ship			2
it was moored at @entity73 in the @entity75 prefecture when the tsunami hit last year			0
the ship drifted into @entity79 waters over the weekend , traveling about a mile per hour and making its way toward the rich fishing waters of the @entity82 , @entity22 said			2
at that point , the @entity10 determined it posed a threat to other ships navigating the area as well as a potential environment hazard , he said			1
the @entity88 and the @entity89 advised the @entity10 where the ship 's sinking would have the least environmental impact			1
" the potential for a pollution incident is unknown at this time , but officials have limited concerns about any biological threats due to the length of time the vessel has been at sea , " the @entity10 said in a statement			2
the @entity10 has been continuously broadcasting the vessel 's location to mariners			1
it will continue the warnings through friday morning until it conducts an aerial survey to determine its sinking left behind no potentially hazardous debris , @entity22 said			0
the trawler 's planned sinking was temporarily halted thursday morning when the @entity10 ship , the @entity112 , based out of @entity113 , @entity5 , arrived to find a @entity41 ship inspecting the trawler			1
" they wanted to claim the vessel for salvage , " @entity22 said			0
" at that point , there was a meeting to discuss whether they had the means to tow or salvage the vessel , " he said			0
" they determined it would be too unsafe			0
at that point , they were asked to leave the area			0
" the @entity112 opened fire thursday afternoon with its 25 mm cannons , blowing holes into the side of the @entity17 , the @entity10 said			1
it took more than four hours for the trawler to sink			0
@entity0 's @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 contributed to this report .			0
