-- president @entity1 has turned off large parts of @entity3 through radicalism , incompetence and political ineptness			1
as my friend @entity10 argues , " @entity1 has the worst political tin ear i 've seen at that level			1
( i realize he thinks he is bringing out his base vote )			0
but he 's almost daring most @entity3 to turn against him			2
" my prediction for midterm election night this coming tuesday is that many @entity3 are going to take the president up on his dare			2
of course , nothing is over until it 's over			0
hard campaigning and a few changes in the news can shift races , and there are a lot of races within the margin of error in polling			0
however , as my colleague @entity27 , with whom i worked on campaigns for 30 years , points out : " in tidal years everything collapses against the losers the last weekend			0
" he remembers races in 1982 where our incumbent was up by 10 points on friday and lost on tuesday			1
my take is that this is going to be a tide if not a tidal wave			0
why ? because in most races , @entity39 will stay home , @entity38 will vote and independents will break heavily against the @entity39			1
recent polls indicate the younger voters ( millennials ) are likely to break @entity38 after two massive victories for @entity1 in that age group			1
@entity48 seem much more favorable to @entity38 than many expected and much less likely to turn out for @entity39			1
meanwhile , the margin for @entity39 among women has shrunk dramatically , and in some races @entity38 are now carrying both men and women ( and that really would create a tidal wave )			1
and while the @entity59 - @entity59 community remains the most loyal to president @entity1 , even there a fight has been developing			1
some new ads appealing to african - americans to leave the @entity39 are stirring up a lot of attention , so it will be fascinating election night to watch for @entity59 - @entity59 turnout and for a small but real increase in the @entity38 vote among african - americans ( note , for example , gov. @entity72 's endorsement by a leading @entity59 newspaper in @entity74 )			1
overall , i think @entity38 will gain six to 10 @entity78 seats , with 10 being more likely than six			1
actually , winning more than 10 ( think @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 in that order ) may be more likely than winning five or less			0
if @entity84 , who has run a brilliant race , beats sen. @entity86 in @entity87 ( and she has run a terrible race ) it will signal a big night for @entity38			1
a key question is whether @entity38 win @entity90 outright , or have to win a special election on january 6 , three days after the new @entity92 assembles			1
that turnout is made more complicated if the governor 's race also goes into a runoff , which would be december 10 , and it will be very hard for @entity39 to win a turnout fight immediately after @entity98 's			1
@entity99 will almost certainly go to a runoff , and the @entity38 will almost certainly win on december 6			1
in the @entity101 , @entity38 will likely gain seven to 14 seats			1
since they start at 234 seats , a 12 - seat gain would match the 1946 post @entity106 high point			1
if they grab 14 seats , they would have more seats than at any time since 1928			0
governorships are a mixed bag , and so intensely local that i really do n't have a good read on what is likely to happen			0
@entity38 start the evening ahead 29 to 21 , and they could add @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			2
however , there are four or five states where the @entity38 incumbent is embattled and in a very close race			2
if @entity38 break even or add one or two governors , i think we could describe it as a very good night for the party			1
at the state legislative level , which has huge implications for the growth of young , future lawmakers , the ability to experiment with new solutions at the state level , and control of congressional reapportionment , look for the @entity38 to gain 300 state legislative seats and control of six more legislative bodies , giving them the all - time high mark in @entity38 history			1
but more than the raw numbers , it will be interesting to keep an eye on some specific trends			0
@entity147 , for example , might see a big resurgence of the @entity38			2
if @entity38 win governorships in @entity115 and @entity116 and the @entity78 race in @entity87 , something big will clearly be happening			1
another trend could be the election of new solution - oriented , bright and articulate @entity38 senators			2
@entity156 in @entity157 has been ignored because he is so clearly going to win , but he will be one of the most intellectually prepared conservatives since @entity159			0
@entity160 will be a superstar if he wins @entity117 , while @entity162 's @entity161 has already become a national figure			0
former @entity115 sen. @entity84 , now running in @entity87 , will have earned star status by winning in two states			0
all that said , @entity167 may be the hardest fought campaign in the country			0
gov. @entity170 has been a very successful manager of the state , but is not a natural politician			0
former gov. @entity173 is a great politician , but his swings from @entity175 to @entity1 @entity176 have made it impossible to predict what kind of governor he would be now			2
this race has so much money going into it , and is so intense , that it is extremely difficult to predict what will happen on tuesday			0
a @entity170 win would be a signal that @entity39 simply are refusing to turn out			0
a @entity173 win would be a signal that the @entity39 machine has been able to mobilize apathetic and disappointed voters			0
one last thing to keep an eye on next week : exit polling on women , latinos , @entity195 , african - americans and millennials			0
if @entity39 are losing ground in most or all of those groups , the coronation of @entity199 may have to be postponed for a while			0
and if all the harsh @entity39 advertising fails , it may be a sign , as @entity207 suggests in the @entity208 , that " cranky social issues warriors " whose campaigns are " obsessed with social issues " may now be defining @entity39 and not @entity38			2
looking beyond the election , there are two big questions , namely , how will president @entity1 react to the results , and what will @entity38 do ? certainly , the president and his team will face a clear choice : do they follow @entity223 's response to the 1918 election and hide in a bunker , using executive orders and defying the new @entity92 ? or do they follow president @entity229 's example after the 1958 election and find a way to work with the opposition party 's congressional leadership ? we may not know the answer to this until the @entity237 and the budget proposals early next year			1
but @entity38 leaders have a unique opportunity to fill a vacuum of ideas and hope , and already people like speaker @entity245 , @entity101 majority leader @entity246 and sen. @entity247 have been outlining positive agendas			2
but @entity10 perhaps caught as well as anyone the challenge facing republicans , when he wrote : " let us not forget that the energy of this wave has been provided by the incompetence of @entity1 and his overreaching allies across the nation			1
the @entity38 , if they win , will now need to put forward new ideas			2
otherwise , victory next tuesday will be an empty one			0
" @entity38 need new ideas			2
but they also need to be able to put those ideas into action			0
join us on @entity265 / @entity264 .			0
