in a lush field outside @entity4 's northwestern city of @entity5 , the face of a little girl stares up at the clouds , her eyes searching for the whirring machines that destroyed her family			2
her face -- a picture of innocence -- adorns a giant poster that has been printed out by a group of artist - activists in @entity4 as part of a project , known as # @entity18 , to humanize victims of the controversial @entity21 drone program in @entity4 's restive tribal region			1
according to one artist , who identified himself as @entity26 , the project is a reaction to the dehumanizing nature of drone warfare , where operators preside over deadly missile attacks from thousands of miles away , coining terms such as " bug splat " to describe victims of these strikes because " viewing the ( dead ) body through a grainy video image gives the sense of an insect being crushed			1
" " we want to shame drone operators and make them realize the human cost of their actions , " said @entity39 sharing untold stories the artists ' work is inspired by " @entity58 , " a global art project by renowned @entity51 photographer @entity50 that uses photographic portraits to share the untold stories and images of people in their communities			0
six months ago , the team behind # @entity18 contacted @entity61 - based legal charity @entity60 , which has been working with prominent lawyer @entity62 to investigate the human cost of drone strikes in @entity4			1
it was @entity62 who gave the # @entity18 team the image of a girl who had lost her parents to a drone strike in 2010 in the @entity72 village of @entity73			1
according to @entity62 , the strike led to the destruction of several mud homes housing @entity78 refugees , and the victims had been mainly women and children			0
the photograph was taken by @entity82 , a photojournalist based in @entity72			0
the name of the child and her actual location is unknown , lost in the nameless surge of refugees that populate this conflict - torn region of @entity4			0
permanent part of landscape # @entity18 said they laid out her image in the field long enough for it to be " captured by satellites in order to make it a permanent part of the landscape on online mapping sites			0
" they had originally wanted to take the poster to @entity72 , where most drone strikes actually take place			0
but a lack of access due to ongoing operations by security forces meant the poster was laid out in the province of @entity108 instead			0
though there has not been a confirmed drone strike in @entity4 since december 2013 , # @entity18 wants to continue to put up more posters of children to instigate further dialogue and awareness , because as @entity26 puts it , " it is only the loss of a child that can show the impact that drone strikes have on the residents of these regions			1
" drone strikes in the tribal regions bordering @entity78 have drawn heated opposition in @entity4 because of civilian casualties			1
the drone strikes have further roiled relations between the two nations , which flared following a 2011 raid by @entity21 commandos on a compound in @entity131 , @entity4 , that killed @entity133 leader @entity132			2
according to @entity135 , 383 @entity21 drone strikes have been reported in @entity4 since 2004 with the death toll estimated to be between 2,296 and 3,718 .			2
