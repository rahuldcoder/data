-- while his jockey starved himself to make the weight limit , one of horse racing 's new stars delivered the goods again despite piling on the pounds			0
@entity8 , a three - year - old trained by champion @entity9 , romped to his fifth win in seven starts on wednesday to add another notable victory to his resume			1
the chestnut colt with an impeccable bloodline fueled speculation that he could become the next @entity18 or @entity19 by making light work of his return to action at the @entity23 at @entity24			1
he comfortably claimed the $ 750,000 first prize at the @entity28 venue 's richest race of the season -- the same one where in 2012 @entity18 won a record eighth consecutive @entity31 event			1
it was @entity8 's first run since late june , when he won the @entity35 to add to his victory at the @entity37 earlier that month			1
" he was ready for a racecourse gallop , that was where he was at , " said @entity9 told reporters			2
" his weight rose alarmingly in the last three weeks but the lads at home were very happy			0
he was a lot of kilos up on his @entity37 run -- he was 15 - 20 kilos heavier -- and that 's a lot of weight			1
@entity9 's 21 - year - old son @entity49 -- who won the @entity24 race last year on @entity51 -- had to drop considerable weight to continue his regular ride on @entity8			1
" i ca n't tell you the massive part @entity49 plays , " his father said			2
" he can do 8 stone 12 pounds ( 56 kg ) but we do n't like him doing it			0
" we 're quite happy for him to put overweight up when he does			0
in the big days we want @entity49 to be on and this is one of them			2
" @entity8 's physical development since the prestigious @entity37 win was remarkable , according to @entity9			1
" @entity49 said that leaving the paddock in the @entity37 he felt like he was a two - or three - year - old , but today leaving he felt like a five - year - old , " he said			1
" there 's such prize - money here and it 's such a prestigious race that it 's very hard to gallop him at a racecourse rather than bring him here			2
" next up , the @entity74 will likely return to their homeland with @entity8 for the @entity76 at @entity77 on september 13 , where the trainer has a leading seven career wins			1
" the more we trained him when he came back , the heavier he got , and i 'd imagine the run will leave him right , " the 44 - year - old said			0
" i 'll speak to the lads but hopefully he will go to @entity77			0
i 'd love him to go there and get him back to @entity87			0
" @entity8 was sired by @entity88 , who also won the @entity37 , @entity35 and @entity76 , while his mother is a two - time @entity91			1
he was ranked 10th in the @entity93 's @entity92 ahead of wednesday 's victory , with a rating of 123			0
@entity88 , meanwhile , sired the top - three finishers at the @entity23 , with the @entity98 second ahead of @entity99			2
@entity18 , who retired unbeaten in 14 races in late 2012 , was the world 's top - ranked racehorse with a rating of 140 -- considered the best of all time			0
champion @entity8 sprinter @entity19 then took over from @entity18 at the top last year before retiring undefeated in 25 races .			0

@entity8 wins third consecutive race at @entity23
@entity112 had put on " 15 - 20 kilos " after his @entity35 triumph in june
