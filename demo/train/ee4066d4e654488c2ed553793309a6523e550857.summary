-- @entity2 's @entity1 has been awarded frontrunner status in the hotly contested $ 20bn race to supply 126 fighter jets to @entity6 , providing a much - needed boost for @entity2 economic and industrial prestige			1
the @entity6 government said the @entity2 @entity12 fighter jet had beaten the four - nation @entity13 to become preferred bidder to equip @entity6 with the multi-role fighter jets in one of the world 's largest military contracts			1
@entity1 now enters exclusive talks with the @entity6 government			1
the contract , estimated to be worth $ 15bn - $ 20bn , will help shape @entity6 's air power for the next three decades and serve as the bedrock of a strategic partnership			1
it also has the potential to reinvigorate the @entity2 defence industry when military budgets are being slashed across @entity29			2
the decision is a blow for @entity13 , whose @entity13 aircraft was seen as the clear frontrunner			0
but it is a huge boost for @entity36 , @entity2 's president , and @entity1 , which has yet to secure an export order for the @entity12			1
shares in @entity1 rose 18 per cent in @entity40			2
mr @entity36 faces an election in may and the declining strength of @entity2 industry is expected to be a crucial campaign battleground , with the incumbent trailing his socialist rival in opinion polls			2
he seized on the announcement as " a signal of confidence in the @entity2 economy "			0
the deal " proves that if we have a good product @entity2 can win in extraordinarily competitive markets "			0
@entity56 , a consultant at @entity57 's , said : " it 's of particular importance to @entity1 as [ this competition ] is really their last , best chance to continue high - end fast jet production			1
" @entity6 's decision came after evaluating the life - cycle cost of the aircraft , the acquisition cost and so - called military offset considerations			1
the offsets include the level of technology that @entity29 companies will disclose to @entity6 and the share of investment they will bring to @entity6 's defence industries			1
the four companies in the @entity13 consortium , led by the @entity79 and including @entity81 's @entity80 and @entity83 's @entity82 , have vowed to fight on given @entity6 's recent history of stripping companies of their preferred bidder status after long , drawn - out negotiations			1
" we are disappointed , but it 's not all over until the contract is signed			0
we do n't yet know the final decision , " one @entity81 diplomat said			0
@entity6 's defence ministry said a final contract would be awarded in the financial year beginning april 2012			1
it said the @entity12 was the cheaper of the rival bids			0
" rafale is the most competent contender , " said a person close to the negotiations at @entity6 's defence ministry			2
after trials last year , @entity6 selected the @entity12 and the multinational @entity13 to compete in the final stages of the competition			0
it had discarded bids from @entity108 's @entity107 , @entity110 's @entity109 , @entity112 's @entity111 and @entity114 's @entity113			0
the decision will be a setback to @entity13 , which had strongly lobbied @entity6 to buy its aircraft and considered its bid stronger in terms of performance , security of supply and strategic alignment			2
it is also a blow for @entity125 , the @entity81 prime minister , and @entity127 , the @entity128 chancellor , who both lobbied on behalf of @entity13			0
