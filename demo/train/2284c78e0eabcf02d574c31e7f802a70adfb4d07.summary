-- @entity1 says it took more than five years to leave her abusive husband			2
throughout their marriage , she says , she endured unwanted sexual advances			2
if she challenged his orders over where and with whom she spent her free time , she says he responded with verbal and physical abuse			2
she finally decided enough was enough the day he hit her in front of their son			0
" when he hit me i realized he could kill me " she said			0
" i decided no more violence			0
i did n't want my son to see him treat me that way			0
" she left him two years ago and moved into her own place			0
she mostly kept the ordeal to herself until she found the courage to express herself in the @entity24 , a collection of hundreds of survival stories touring the country this summer			1
her words in @entity29 are etched into a 4 - foot red square that shares space with others ' stories in a 16 - foot square			1
when laid out in full , the squares of 250 stories of surviving rape and abuse stretch out to a 100 - foot multicolored square			1
" you told me that you loved me but now i know and i understand that i was raped , " she says			0
" i was your wife , not your property			0
" the brainchild of @entity44 - based activist group " force : upsetting @entity46 , " the @entity24 project is making 13 stops in 12 states , displaying portions of the quilt in public spaces and growing its footprint through quilt - making workshops			1
the goal of the project is to create healing spaces by and for survivors , said @entity59 , co-founder of @entity45			1
the quilt evolved from discussions about how to create a permanent monument to survivors of rape , similar to memorials for war veterans , based on research showing how public monuments can help survivors recover from trauma , she said			1
quilting has a long history connected to social justice movements , perhaps most notably through the @entity73 , which began touring the country in 1988 in remembrance of those who succumbed to the disease			0
@entity59 hopes bearing witness to the quilt will help erode stigma attached to rape , similar to the effect the @entity83 quilt had on raising awareness around the disease			1
" when we remove the stigma from rape and we 're able to have public conversations and not blame the survivor , it 's one step closer to curbing the epidemic			2
" the presence of the quilt transforms parks , sports fields and town squares into reverential spaces for grieving and reflecting , said @entity98 , a @entity44 social worker who volunteers for @entity45			1
" it creates a community holding space instead of the burden of trauma being on the shoulders of each individual supporter or survivor , " @entity98 said			2
" it can be solidifying and reassuring			0
it 's not just on you anymore			0
" part of the healing comes from the collective impact of bearing witness to hundreds of survival stories			1
it also comes from creating the squares , some of which starts in workshops weeks before the @entity24 comes to town			1
@entity45 partnered with community - based prevention and public safety organizations , who made the quilt workshops part of their community outreach			1
@entity127 's @entity126 hosted workshops two weeks in advance of the quilt 's arrival in @entity132 , where it was displayed at a local high school			1
quilting is a cultural tradition of the @entity138 tribe that inhabits the region , making it an ideal project for the community the shelter serves			1
" it gave them a voice without putting them in the spotlight and i think that in itself was very powerful , and a good way to start the healing process , " education outreach coordinator @entity143 said			2
" to stand in solidarity not only with our relatives here but with women in the @entity157 was also very empowering for them and let them know they 're not alone			0
" helping others with their squares brought up memories of @entity143 's experience being molested as a child			0
her square reads , " @entity166			0
" " it created a safe space for me that i really needed			0
" witnessing the quilt inspired @entity44 activist @entity170 to bring to the surface her own history of being raped			1
@entity170 helped organize workshops through her work with anti-street harassment organization " @entity176 ! @entity44			2
" but she has never publicly identified herself as a rape survivor			2
too often stories of sexual harassment in the media focus on stranger danger , date rape or the experiences of white middle - class college students , she said			1
seeing the diversity of experiences represented in the quilt inspired @entity170 , who is biracial , to make her own square			2
" what i love about the whole project is the narrative of control by survivors , " she said			1
" it speaks to the diversity of different experiences who have gone through abuse and rape because we 're the ones sharing those stories in the way we choose			1
" @entity203 says creating her square was cathartic			0
she hopes sharing her story will inspire others to " free " themselves of a despair she knows firsthand			0
" reading these words tells you yes , there is an opportunity to break the cycle of violence , " she said			0
" it does n't have to be like this			0
