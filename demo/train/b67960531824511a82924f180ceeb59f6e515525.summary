-- famed tenor @entity1 , who died on thursday at the age of 71 , was one of opera 's most adaptable and ebullient performers , appearing on stage with singers as varied as @entity7 , @entity9 's @entity8 and @entity10			1
much as the star power of @entity14 and @entity15 revived widespread interest in classical ballet in the 1970s and 1980s , @entity1 's beaming charisma and bravura style captured the attention of the late - 20th - century audience for opera			1
widely considered the greatest tenor of his time , @entity1 began his life modestly in @entity24 , the son of @entity26 , a baker and amateur singer , and @entity28 , who worked at the local tobacco factory			1
" i dreamed to become a singer when i was four and i hear my father singing in the church with a beautiful tenor voice , " he told @entity0 in a 1991 interview			2
" and i say to myself , well , let 's try to do something			0
" the young @entity1 -- who played soccer with his town 's junior team -- joined the church choir with his father and traveled with him to @entity43 , where the singing group won first prize at the @entity47 singing competition			1
although the experience left @entity1 enthralled with singing , he graduated from the local teaching institute in 1955 and taught elementary school for two years , then worked as an insurance salesman			2
he continued his vocal studies , however , working first with with @entity54 and then with @entity55			0
then , in 1961 , @entity1 won the prestigious @entity56 and made his operatic debut at the @entity58 as @entity59 in @entity61 's " @entity60			1
" his fame spread throughout @entity63 and then throughout the @entity65 continent as he made his international debut in @entity68 's " @entity67 " in @entity69			1
when @entity7 brought him on - stage with her during a performance of @entity72 's " @entity71 " with the @entity73 in 1965 , @entity1 began his @entity75 career			1
he debuted at @entity77 's @entity76 three years later , and eventually marked 379 performances there , including his final opera , @entity61 's " @entity80 " in 2004 , in which he performed as the painter @entity80			1
in between @entity1 sold millions of records and raised millions of dollars for charity through benefit concerts , often sharing the stage with pop stars as well as other opera singers			1
of his recordings , 1990 's " @entity93 " was the first classical album to reach no. 1 on @entity92 's pop charts , where it remained for five weeks			0
1994 's " @entity96 , " with @entity97 and @entity98 , remains the best selling classical album of all time			2
@entity1 joined with @entity97 and @entity98 in 1990 , and although critics complained that @entity1 's vocal skills were waning , the trio performed together for 14 years			1
among his charities were a 1995 " @entity103 " that raised $ 8.5 million and other concerts that raised $ 3.3 million for refugees from @entity106 and $ 1 million for refugees from @entity108			0
in artistic terms , @entity1 brought to the stage a voice neatly suited to the traditional bel canto , or " beautiful singing " style , essential to 17th - century @entity63 opera			1
as much about intensity as pitch , bel canto focuses the voice , concentrating the sound with both outstanding warmth and agility			0
so demanding is this work even of the best singers that @entity1 in concert recital could be seen rising to the balls of his feet during the most challenging passages			2
a long , white handkerchief always hung from one hand as he sang , his eyebrows arched high in the effort , forming an expression seemingly of surprise at his own success			0
from his small beginnings , @entity1 rose to great heights , performing in front of 500,000 people in @entity77 's @entity139 -- a concert seen by millions on television -- and before another 300,000 at @entity143 ' @entity142			1
he won countless awards and honors -- including five @entity146 -- and was named @entity147 by then - secretary - general @entity148			0
he launched an international competition , @entity150 , in 1982			0
he even founded a teaching facility for young singers in his home town			0
his signature aria , @entity61 's " @entity154 " from " @entity155 , " was chosen as the theme music for the 1990 soccer @entity157 , hosted by @entity63			1
he also performed the aria at the opening ceremony of the @entity161 in @entity162			0
the great singer was also known as an equestrian expert , organizing one of the international show jumping circuit 's most important competitions , the @entity168 , in @entity24			0
coinciding with that event , @entity1 also staged an annual charity concert , @entity1 and @entity171			2
the portly singer retired from staged opera in 2004 , but was on a " farewell tour " of concerts when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2006 and underwent emergency surgery to remove the tumor			1
although the remaining concerts of his tour were canceled , his management said that he hoped to resume the tour in 2007			0
when cancer finally stopped @entity1 from singing , it was only the second interruption of his career			2
" i think i just stopped for one year when from a kid i become a man and the voice is changing , " he said in 1991			0
" i was an alto and became a tenor and that is the only time i think i remember to have stopped singing			2
otherwise i have sung all my life			0
