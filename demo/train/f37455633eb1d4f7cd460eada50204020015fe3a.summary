@entity0 , @entity1 -- when you 're on a college campus and you ask someone what they 're studying , one answer you do n't typically hear is " hip hop			1
" but @entity10 in @entity0 , @entity11 , is the first school in the nation to offer an accredited diploma program on the study and performance of hip hop music			1
for @entity18 , it is one of the primary reasons he 's pursuing secondary education at all			0
his first attempt at community college , taking general education courses , did n't work out so well			1
" i pretty much bombed my math class right out of the shoot , " 19 - year - old @entity18 said			2
" then i realized i need to go to school for something that i enjoy , or at least pursue something that i enjoy , so i 'm not miserable			0
" playing drums gives him more pleasure than anything			0
but for a long time , he 'd considered music school taboo			2
" [ i thought to myself ] ' a lot of musicians do n't go that route , ' " @entity18 said			0
" but then i grew up in my head a little bit and i just said maybe i 'll try it			0
" @entity18 discovered @entity10 and its three - semester hip hop diploma program			1
his ultimate goal is to be a big - time drummer like @entity43 of @entity44			2
" when i was 14 , [ my brother ] took me to a @entity44 concert in @entity47 at the @entity48			0
i was watching @entity43 play the drums , and his drum set sunk into the stage , went underground , and he went into the crowd and started going nuts for the crowd			0
" " that is what i want to do , and there 's no doubt in my mind			0
" his plan is to complete the diploma track and then consider a full degree in percussion performance			2
" when i 'm sitting at home , i just go up , close my eyes and play music			2
so , like if i were to do it for a job , it would n't feel like work , and i could be having fun making my own money			0
" but hip hop is not a genre without its critics			1
" there are people who might say , ' if you have hip hop in a college , is n't that almost a contradiction in terms ? " said @entity10 president @entity76			1
" ' it 's a street music , it grew up in the neighborhoods , how can you have it in the college ? ' " " this is a very important art form that is not going away , " @entity76 tells the genre 's opponents			1
" when we look at hip hop closely , we see that we can study its impact on people 's lives , on society			1
where does this music come from ? when it 's angry , when it 's sometimes vicious , vile or rude , why is that ? what are people trying to say ? these are important questions to ask			2
" @entity106 , a drums and rhythm instructor on the hip hop faculty , says that the birth of hip hop resembles that of jazz music and the time is right for hip hop to be treated as such in the schools			1
" @entity117 started like hip hop -- out of the urban neighborhoods , black neighborhoods			1
there was a language , there was clothing , there was a style that everybody started copying			0
so when they started putting jazz in schools , there was controversy at first , " @entity106 said			0
" i felt that we were in the same situation with that			0
" in the six weeks the program has been underway , there has been no sign of a collective protest			0
one reason could be that the curriculum is part hands - on and part textbook learning , as well			1
instructors include various @entity147 - based hip hop artists such as @entity148 , the program 's coordinator who 's touring at venues across the country			1
more internationally known names are instructors as well			2
for example , @entity155 instructor @entity154 had top 40 hits in the @entity158 and has also performed with industry figure @entity159			1
founded in 1985 , the school is accredited by the @entity162			0
according to the school 's web site , it has a yearly average of 600 students enrolled who are taught by the 100 - member faculty			1
and to those who are surprised at the geographic locale of the first hip hop program , the @entity47 - @entity0 area just might have more to offer than you think			1
" it 's funny -- here we are in the upper @entity177 , where people might think , ' @entity180 , it 's a backwater , you 're not @entity181 , you 're not @entity182 , ' " @entity76 said			0
" the @entity147 has a really rich musical community that goes from the best chamber orchestra in the world to some of the most unique rap music collectives you 'd ever want to find			2
so this is a great place to do it			0
