-- somewhere , in a parallel dimension , when cyclist @entity8 appears on live video link beamed in to a court room in the @entity12 city of @entity13 on tuesday , his testimony detailing the breadth and impunity of doping within his sport would send shock waves across the world			1
but , in the here and now , such is the public 's current fatigue of drug revelations in sport that his appearance at the trial of the @entity24 scandal -- where @entity12 doctor @entity25 is accused of masterminding a blood doping network at the highest level of professional cycling -- will be met with little more than a collective shrug			1
@entity8 was an @entity30 cyclist who won a gold medal at the @entity32 before riding with @entity33 in the @entity34			1
he has already detailed his own drug - taking exploits in his book " @entity37 , " helping to lift the lid on the murky , dangerous and in some cases criminal world of performance - enhancing drugs			0
but those revelations -- which implicated @entity33 as much as himself -- were just the tip of the iceberg			0
from @entity33 's carefully managed but ultimately soulless confession to doping fraud on @entity50 to the release of a damning report by the @entity53 -- the government 's top criminal intelligence body -- in to widespread doping in some of the country 's top sports and the ongoing @entity24 trial , the fidelity of sportsmen and women is increasingly being called into question			1
" i do n't think anything has changed , there have been doping cheats in sports for a long , long time , and there are still doping cheats in sports , " @entity61 , president of the @entity62 , told @entity0			1
" what we are seeing in more recent days is a number of revelations which give us some sort of indication that , in some cases , it 's quite widespread			2
i think we now know there was a period in cycling where it was extremely widespread			0
" poachers versus gamekeepers but while the reputation of sports stars has taken a hit , the people charged with catching them -- the various different governing bodies and , at the top , @entity62 -- remain one step behind the dopers			1
@entity33 , after all , claimed correctly that he never failed a drugs test			0
yet for the man who heads the world 's top anti-doping body , the revelations are a move in the right direction , rather than proof of failure			2
" has cycling fixed itself up ? well , i do n't know , " admitted @entity61 , before suggesting that the revelations " makes us all think about the problem , and that 's not such a bad thing			1
" " i would much sooner see all of these things about doping in sport on the surface than to know that there was doping in sport and we do n't know about it , " he added			2
despite the public 's doping fatigue , the revelations that have emerged from the @entity24 trial so far have been shocking			1
@entity25 has been accused , along with his sister and three other defendants from various other cycling teams , of running a blood doping ring that involved transfusions of re-oxygenated blood			2
blood doping involves using hormones or transfusions to boost the numbers of red cells in the body			2
this can increase a sportsman or woman 's ability to carry oxygen to the muscles , a distinct advantage in endurance sports			2
hotel transfusion several top names in cycling have been implicated			0
according to a 2006 report in @entity12 newspaper @entity140 @entity8 paid @entity25 at least $ 47,000 for the procedure			1
but doping was n't a criminal offence in @entity12 in 2006 when @entity25 was arrested and hundreds of bags of blood from his clients seized			1
instead they have been accused of endangering public health , charges they deny			0
@entity62 's own medical expert dr. @entity150 gave a damning appraisal of the health risks that many of the cyclists faced when he testified in @entity12 , according to @entity156 website which is covering the trial			1
" extracting half a liter or a liter of blood presents a greater risk than extracting the usual amounts			0
that 's up to 20 % of the body 's total , whereas you would only extract 1 % for a blood analysis , " he said			0
" a hotel does not fulfill the conditions required for a transfusion , " he added , referring to the alleged unsanitary conditions in which the blood doping took place			0
" a cool bag for picnics is n't the best thing for transporting blood			0
" @entity150 also raised the possibility that cyclists would have been exposed to greater risk of contracting diseases such as @entity183 and hepatitis			0
" we 've been fighting this case now for the best part of seven years , " said @entity61 , before turning his attentions to other sports			2
" those hundreds of blood bags that appear to belong to many different types of sportsmen and women , so ( it 's ) not just one sport			2
we want to know who they are , we want to know what 's in those bags , and all of that knowledge and information passed on to the authorities that will take action against the owners of that blood			0
" soccer stars implicated ? many of the names attached to those damning , currently anonymous blood bags could contain the names of well - known soccer players			0
during the trial @entity25 told the court that he had many clients in the world of soccer , athletics and boxing			0
but the judge ruled that @entity25 would not be compelled to reveal names			0
@entity25 ' revelations have not gone unnoticed by @entity62 officials , who believe soccer 's governing body @entity222 could do much more to tackle alleged doping in the game -- particularly the use of @entity227 , or erythropoietin , a hormone produced by the kidney that is injected to stimulate red blood cell production that has long been used by cyclists			1
" i acknowledge that under the world body , @entity222 , there is an anti-doping program , " said @entity61			1
" they can do more , they 've got to test players , many more of them , and make sure they are testing for the drug of choice @entity227			2
otherwise they are paying lip service to the issue rather than convincing anybody that they 've got an effective program			0
" the answer , according to @entity61 , is to insist on a biological profile and passport for each player , an issue he raised with @entity250 , the secretary general of @entity222 , when they met last week			1
@entity222 announced after that meeting that it will introduce biological profiles at june 's @entity255 tournament in @entity256			1
the scheme will see a biological profile taken from each player two months before so that any marked changes in that profile at the tournament could point to blood doping or hormone use			0
" i would like to see , particularly team sports , take up the athlete 's biological passport , " @entity61 said			1
" there is absolutely no reason why in the major codes of football , and in the major sporting events right throughout the world they should n't all ( have ) the tool known as the biological passport			0
that will do a lot to stamp out doping in sport , and most of those major codes can easily afford the cost of running that program			2
" but , for now , the focus remains on cycling , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity8 's testimony			1
@entity61 hopes that the trial will be a watershed moment for doping in sport			1
" this is not the first court case that we 've had on this subject over the past seven years , but we will continue to exhaust all legal rights , " @entity61 said			1
" we believe it is important enough to do that			0
i hope this may well be the final court case that we have to participate in			0

@entity0 spoke to the president of the @entity62 @entity61
@entity62 president believes it 's better current doping allegations in sport are out in the open
@entity61 *criticizes* @entity222 for not doing enough on checking for *banned* *substance* @entity227 in the past
