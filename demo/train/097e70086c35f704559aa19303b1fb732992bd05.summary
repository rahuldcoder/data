-- the health of a @entity8 woman battling a rare flesh - eating bacteria has " slightly improved , " a spokeswoman for a @entity3 hospital said thursday , though the new mother remains sedated and in critical condition			1
@entity15 has " undergone 11 debridement surgeries to remove tissue since being admitted may 11 " to @entity14 , spokeswoman @entity10 said thursday by e-mail			1
but unlike 24 - year - old @entity16 of @entity17 -- who has lost a leg , part of her abdomen , her remaining foot and her hands as she fights the same disease , according to online updates from her father , @entity25 -- no parts of @entity15 's body have been amputated			1
" last night , @entity28 told the family in his update that ' @entity15 's vitals and blood work is good			1
' this is a good day for her , and we will take it , " said @entity33 , @entity15 's brother , in a message relayed by the hospital			1
@entity15 gave birth to twins , @entity42 and @entity43 , on may 7 in @entity44			1
at that time , @entity15 , a paramedic , was believed to be healthy			1
but a few days later she went to hospital near her @entity8 home after noticing a rapidly expanding bruise on her leg , her husband @entity28 , a firefighter , told @entity0 last week			1
surviving a flesh - eating disease she was diagnosed then with necrotizing fasciitis and has been intubated and sedated every day since , according to her brother and the hospital			1
a number of bacteria , which are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections , can lead to the disease			2
when it gets into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain			0
the disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20 % of the time , according to the @entity71			2
@entity72 : i survived @entity74 ... barely dr. @entity75 , chairman of the @entity76 at the @entity77 , estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the @entity79 , though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities			0
just last sunday , @entity15 had undergone seven surgeries for her ailment -- meaning she has had four more such operations in recent days			1
@entity33 said , as he did days ago , that the family is thankful the disease remains confined to his sister 's legs			1
while hooked up to a respirator , @entity15 is now breathing on her own , according to her brother			2
her baby boy and girl , who are being cared for by relatives and friends , remain healthy and are doing well			0
" please pray with us that @entity15 will recover quickly to a point where she will be able to interact with and enjoy this special time in their lives , " @entity33 said			2
@entity25 posted an update earlier thursday about his daughter @entity102 , who is fighting the same disease as @entity15 in the intensive care unit of @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity17			1
she was with friends may 1 near the @entity108 , about 50 miles west of @entity44 , when the zip line that she was holding snapped			0
she fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close			0
three days later , still in pain , she went to an emergency room , and doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh - devouring bacteria @entity119			1
her father has written regularly since about her situation , with the psychology department at the @entity123 -- where @entity102 had been pursuing her master 's degree in psychology -- also posting online updates			2
on thursday , her father wrote on @entity127 that @entity102 " has finally stabilized to the point that she has not needed any ventilator assistance for over 24 hours			2
" " each breath is a victory			0
each heart beat is a cause for celebration			0
when she opens her eyes , that is like a ticker tape parade down @entity140			0
when she mouths words , angelic hosts rejoice , " @entity25 said			0
" that is what each moment is like for us			0
" he described several such moments from earlier in the week , including @entity102 lighting up after listening to a " private concert " from a musician who 'd written a song about her , waking up to talk of " treats " in the hospital and sitting up in a chair			2
" when the doctors put @entity102 in that chair , their expectations were to give her an hour , " @entity25 said , elaborating on the latter milestone			0
" five hours later , @entity102 decided it was time to lie down			0
had she been running an @entity161 marathon , i think @entity102 would have experienced a record - breaking , gold - medal moment			0
" @entity0 's @entity164 and @entity165 contributed to this report .			0

@entity15 has had 11 surgeries since being diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis
while in critical condition , she has *n't* had amputations and the disease is all in her leg
