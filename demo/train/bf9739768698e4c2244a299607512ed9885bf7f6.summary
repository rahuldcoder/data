@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was a chilly , unwelcoming place once reserved for infamous criminals			1
not even the federal government appeared to want it after the penitentiary closed in the 1960s			0
@entity10 remembers " @entity3 " a little more warmly : a place where fellow @entity12 took a stand that may have helped end the @entity15 policy of tribal assimilation			1
forty years ago friday , dozens of @entity12 -- mostly @entity1 college students -- boated to the largely abandoned island in @entity18 , starting an unarmed occupation that lasted nearly 19 months and captured the attention of media around the world			1
a revolving group of @entity12 held the island from november 20 , 1969 , to june 10 , 1971 , staying in the former penitentiary buildings without running water , phone service and , for part of the time , electricity			1
" we changed the whole course of history , not only for the island , but for the government and its relationship with the @entity12 , " @entity29 , who helped organize the occupiers but did n't stay on the island , said during a visit there with a @entity2 crew			1
the initial group demanded control of @entity3 so it could develop several @entity12 institutions , such as a center of native american studies , a spiritual center and a museum , partly as replacements for a @entity0 @entity12 center that had burned down			1
the island was ready for the taking			0
the federal government , which closed @entity3 's prison in 1963 , considered the island surplus property , though there were moves to find a private buyer , said @entity55 , a @entity15 @entity56 on @entity3			1
but another motive for the occupation was the government 's general treatment of @entity12			2
the @entity15 16 years earlier had begun a policy of terminating @entity12 reservations and relocating the inhabitants to urban areas			1
" [ the @entity3 occupiers ] wanted to focus attention on broken treaties , broken promises and termination of tribal areas , " said professor @entity65 , chairman of the @entity66 at @entity67 , @entity68 , and author of several publications on the occupation			1
the landing party -- calling itself @entity79 -- was led by @entity80 , a @entity81 and student at what was then @entity83			0
many of his comrades were native american college students he recruited , largely from the @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity65 said			0
the government warned the occupiers to leave , and for three days the @entity90 tried to blockade the island			2
but humor -- and the @entity95 's counterculture climate -- would work for the trespassers			0
@entity29 , who said he generally remained at his @entity95 home but helped the occupiers with logistics , released a public declaration of the group 's intentions			1
in it , he took shots at @entity106 explorers of centuries past , saying the group members claimed @entity3 by right of discovery and that they would pay for the island with $ 24 worth of goods			2
" the liberal people of @entity0 [ and ] @entity115 , the @entity95 ... they loved what we were doing because we used satire and humor , " @entity29 , now 80 , recalled			0
the press covered the occupation , and the public began delivering supplies by boat -- ignoring the blockade , he said			0
the @entity125 intended to remove the occupiers , but the @entity127 told it to back off and ordered an end to the blockade , @entity65 said			2
in time , other native americans would join the occupation , with the high population point coming on @entity133 , with 400 people , @entity29 said			0
@entity10 's daughter , @entity135 , was 15 at the time			0
she said she remembers staying at the island on weekends , choosing for fun -- as other kids did -- to sleep in the old penitentiary 's cells while adults generally slept in buildings meant for the prison 's staff			0
" we were just kind of happy to be a part of all these @entity12 coming from everywhere , " @entity135 said			2
the population changed over time , with newcomers from across the country boating in and veterans departing			0
one of them was now - tv and film actor @entity153 , who as a child arrived with his siblings and mother , who is a @entity158 native from @entity159			0
" forty years later , native people still recognize the occupation for what it was and remains : a seminal event in @entity15 history that brought the plight of @entity12 to the world 's attention , " @entity153 and his brother @entity160 said in a statement			1
" it 's easy to pass off the @entity3 event as largely symbolic , but the truth is the spirit and dream of @entity3 never died , it simply found its way to other fights , " the @entity153 brothers said			2
" native sovereignty , repatriation , environmental justice , the struggle for basic human rights -- these are the issues native people were fighting for then , and are the same things we are fighting for today			0
" in january 1970 , @entity189 , the leader on the island , left for good after his stepdaughter fell down a stairwell to her death , @entity65 wrote in an account of the occupation posted on the @entity197 web site for @entity3			2
@entity189 himself would die in a shooting unrelated to the occupation in 1972 , @entity65 said			0
in 1971 , authorities decided to end the occupation by going in when the group was at its smallest			0
police and federal agents removed 15 people on june 10 , nearly 19 months after the occupation began , @entity65 wrote in the online account			1
the occupiers did n't get their demands			1
but president @entity211 ended the @entity15 tribal termination policy in june 1970 , while they still were on the island			1
this was a result of the public spotlight that the occupation put on @entity12 issues , @entity65 and @entity55 said			1
" it might have happened anyway , but @entity3 had the attention of the nation , and it led to those changes being initiated in the @entity127 , " @entity55 said			2
today the island is part of the @entity197 , hosting hundreds of thousands of people for tours each year			0
@entity10 , who now lives on a reservation in @entity229 , said the occupation was the most significant event in native american history since the @entity233 : " it brought the @entity12 issues to the forefront of the public awareness			1
" @entity2 's @entity236 contributed to this report .			0

@entity12 occupied @entity3 for 19 months , starting in november 1969
@entity12 wanted to focus on " broken treaties , broken promises , " professor says
occupiers did n't get demands but may have helped end @entity15 policy of tribal assimilation
*co-organizer* : move brought " @entity12 issues to the forefront of the public awareness "
