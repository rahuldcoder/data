@entity0 -- three " extremely traumatized " women are being cared for by a charity after managing to leave a @entity0 house where they had allegedly been held captive for more than 30 years			1
one of the women -- a 30 - year - old @entity11 -- " appears to have been in servitude for her entire life , " @entity6 detective inspector @entity5 said			1
she and the other two women , a 57 - year - old from @entity14 and a 69 - year - old from @entity16 , have been taken to a place of safety			1
experts and charities explain how they might recover from their ordeal			1
how are the three women faring ? a television documentary on forced marriages relating to the work of @entity26 prompted one of the victims to call for help ; that organization 's founder @entity30 told @entity1 the women were coping despite their ordeal			1
" i 've seen them on a number of occasions , " she said			2
" they 're doing remarkably well considering how harrowing it 's been for them			2
every effort has been made to ensure they 're being taken care of , but it 's going to be a very long journey			2
" now we 've heard of the arrests of the two people allegedly involved in this and that 's going to be another journey in itself			2
it 's going to be very difficult			2
we 're really pleased with the work that we 've done in partnership with the police and they 're to be commended for taking this seriously			2
" how can victims of slavery or abuse be rehabilitated ? @entity58 is of the essence when suspected victims of slavery or imprisonment are rescued , and the first moments are known as the " golden hour			1
" @entity65 , anti-trafficking response co-ordinator for the @entity67 which helps trafficking victims in the @entity69 for the first 45 days , said it was very important to quickly give them back their self - worth			1
" many victims will have had no opportunity to make decisions for themselves , even down to the smallest things like when to sleep or what to eat			1
" so it 's important to put them on a road to recovery by giving them a safe environment , allowing them to choose when to eat and sleep , making them feel at home , offering them kindness and compassion			2
" it can be as basic as playing cards with the victims to put them at their ease , she said			1
each case is different , with this latest being the most extreme one that @entity99 said she had ever heard about			2
" i assume it will take many years for the victims in this case to recover , although we do not know the full details			1
it 's a complete one - off			0
" how do people who have been held captive find resilience ? captives in similar situations draw strength from each other , @entity99 said , just as the three women who escaped this year after 11 years of sexual abuse in @entity113 , @entity114 , did			1
in that notorious case one of the victims , @entity116 , credited @entity116 -- with whom she shared a dark room measuring about 7 feet by 11Â½ feet -- for saving her life			1
" i never let her fall , and she never let me fall , " @entity116 told the trial of her tormentor @entity116			0
" she nursed me back to health when i was dying from his abuse			0
my friendship with @entity130 is the only good thing to come from this situation			0
" she returned the favor , at a cost to herself , placing herself in between @entity116 and @entity135 , taking on physical and sexual abuse herself to protect her friend , said @entity138 , a pioneer in trauma research who testified in the case			0
being the oldest , @entity116 often served as doctor , nurse and pediatrician for @entity116 and the young child that @entity116 fathered			0
she acted as the midwife , when it was born , delivering @entity151 's baby in a plastic swimming pool			0
somehow , @entity116 , @entity151 and @entity135 kept hope			0
as @entity116 said , " we said we 'll all get out alive some day and we did			0
" @entity116 was sentenced to life imprisonment but was later found hanging in his prison cell			1
how many more victims of domestic slavery are there ? authorities have rescued about 1,200 men and women in @entity163 and @entity164 since july 2011 , according to the @entity67			1
many of those victims have endured sexual abuse in brothels , forced labor or domestic servitude			1
@entity69 special envoy for @entity173 @entity172 told @entity1 he was not surprised by this case as there were likely to be many cases of domestic slavery in the country			1
" we do n't know the number but we know it 's pretty huge			0
domestics are hidden away , " he said			0
" the difference between slavery when it was manifest in @entity114 -- as it was in @entity163 -- was that you could see it everywhere , " @entity172 said			1
" since then having abolished it , it 's grown , it 's got bigger and bigger -- in fact they say it 's between 10 and 20 times the size it was in the 1800s			0
" @entity172 said the largest number of people involved in slavery in @entity69 were in brothels , and that group was followed by men held against their will in debt bondage			1
" @entity207 " was the title of one recent report into human trafficking in @entity0 , which explored where the abuses were taking place			1
" increasingly the authorities and many residents in @entity0 know there is a criminal activity called human trafficking , " it concluded			1
" what they do n't usually know , accurately , is what human trafficking actually constitutes and what forms are taking place around them			0
most @entity0 residents imagine that it does not touch directly on their lives -- that the exploitation takes place in brothels run by foreign gangs controlling foreign women			1
but it 's nearer than they think			0
" the @entity67 's @entity65 said if anyone had concerns about neighbors , they should contact police			0
causes for suspicion could be if there were several people living in a house , people buying large amounts of food , inhabitants struggling physically or those who were malnourished			0
they may not go often , or be under the control of others			0
how do victims of domestic servitude live ? such victims often sleep on the floor in the kitchen , eat the leftover remains of the household and have no days off , @entity172 said			2
" domestic slavery is rampant particularly in the @entity251 countries , in @entity252 and in @entity253			2
by and large it 's people who have had their passports removed , they have no pay and are exploited and used			0
" it 's not trafficking but slavery by any other word , except that you do n't see it			2
the problem with this case is that you never know when it will appear : with millions of houses and people it 's all behind closed doors			0
this exposes a problem in all western countries			0
it 's not the police you should blame it 's the next - door neighbor , but you do n't know what to look for			0
" these people will be damaged for life			0
