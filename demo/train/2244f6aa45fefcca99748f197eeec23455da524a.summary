@entity0 -- @entity6 sen. @entity5 's campaign paid for more than 12 years of wrongfully taxpayer - funded travel , her office announced on friday			1
@entity5 's campaign reimbursed the federal government $ 33,727 for chartered flights that were wrongly charged to her @entity12 office			2
the payment comes a month after the @entity6 @entity14 ordered her attorney to audit her office 's travel spending to root out incorrectly - billed campaign travel			1
@entity5 said the " mistakes , " which go back to 2002 , stemmed from " sloppy book keeping			1
" " i take full responsibility			2
they should have never happened , and i apologize for this , " @entity5 said in the friday statement			2
@entity1 first reported in august that @entity5 used government dollars to pay for a chartered flight that took her to a campaign fundraiser last november			0
@entity5 's campaign spokesmen said then that the charter company mistakenly billed @entity5 's @entity12 office instead of her campaign and that mistake had already been rectified			2
the next day , @entity5 's office announced she would refund the @entity12 for a separate $ 5,700 charter flight after @entity1 questioned the expense			0
it was shortly after that report that @entity5 ordered a full review of her travel expenses			1
@entity5 said her office now has a new system successfully used by other @entity12 offices to prevent future mistakes			0
the reimbursed funds accounted for about 11 % of her @entity12 office 's travel costs over the last 12 years			0
@entity47 , @entity5 's attorney who conducted the review , also wrote in a letter to the @entity50 that future taxpayer - funded charter flights would be " cleared in advance by counsel			0
" rep. @entity54 , a @entity55 challenging @entity5 for her @entity12 seat , slammed @entity5 for only disclosing her travel records since 2002 , when the @entity58 changed the rules on payment for campaign - related travel			1
" no matter how sen. @entity5 spins it , she billed taxpayers for dozens of private jet flights since the turn of the century , " he said			1
@entity54 called on @entity5 to release her nearly 18 years of travel records as a senator			1
" prior to that ( rule change ) , it was also illegal to bill taxpayers for private flights			0
given senator @entity5 's own admission of faulty oversight , how do taxpayers know that problems did not exist prior to 2002 ? " @entity54 said in the statement			0
@entity5 's flight troubles first came in late july when @entity80 listed @entity5 as one of the @entity12 's most frequent flyers after she billed the federal government more than $ 47,000 in chartered flights in 2013 alone .			0
