-- they recline in their bras and panties , some wearing pearls and @entity6 - inspired bouffants , shooting smiles at the camera			1
the images are just like many a lingerie ad designed to entice , but these are images of young girls -- those who are n't even old enough to need bras			1
@entity14 company @entity13 has designed a line of " loungerie " -- a compromise between loungewear and lingerie -- for children between the ages of 4 and 12			1
a line for teenagers and infants is seemingly age appropriate , but the designs for children are drawing fire			1
the company 's mission is to be " the first designer brand dedicated to ' loungerie ' for children and teenagers , comprised of loungewear and lingerie to be worn over and under , inside and outside			1
" @entity34 first broke the story , stating " what 's disturbing about @entity13 is not just the fact that it 's lingerie for people who probably should n't be old enough to even know what lingerie is , but the photographs on their website			1
" in the comments , readers went back and forth over the appropriateness of the lingerie , asking if these girls were old enough to make decisions about how they want to look and , even more hotly contested , if the styling of the photos sexualizes the lingerie , rather than the designs themselves			1
in an interview with the lingerie trade website , @entity13 creator @entity53 defended her brand and the photographs included in the ad campaign			1
" there is no vulgar connotation , " she said			0
" the materials are totally opaque , there is no transparency , no lace			0
the triangles -- there are only two in the collection -- are used in swimwear for the smallest children and as a first support for young girls , even by young women who are not looking for proper support since the tops i design do not offer any			1
there is no bra in my collection			0
" the children are not wearing heels , nor nail polish , nor lipstick , " @entity53 added			0
" their hairstyles are exaggerated , just as are games and the child 's universe			0
these models are professional models and not ' lolitas ' who have stolen women 's clothing			0
" comments on the @entity97 story show that many who have viewed the ads do n't take away the innocent " child 's universe " that @entity53 was hoping to convey			2
the makeup on the models , although it may not include lipstick , was another upsetting factor for viewers , and while @entity53 says there are no bras in the collection , it was assumed that the " swimwear tops " were lingerie-esque in appearance			0
@entity53 also said that the loungerie is not distributed in the @entity112 or the @entity113			2
the criticism of the @entity14 clothing line is not unlike when @entity116 and @entity116 released its " @entity119 " push - up bra , originally designed for 7 - year - olds but later marketed to 12 - year - old girls after a public outcry			1
previously on @entity0 / opinion : parents , do n't dress your girls like tramps in 2007 , the @entity127 developed a task force of psychologists to tackle the issue of sexualization of girls in every form of media			2
dr. @entity135 was a part of that task force and continues to address female body image and sexuality			0
dr. @entity135 and her colleagues on the task force say that sexually objectifying women at a progressively younger age has been occurring for the last 20 years in advertising			0
the photo spread by @entity13 came as no surprise to her , although she still considers these ad campaigns to be " nauseating and sick			1
" in a society that continues to value younger women , we 've reached an ultimate low , @entity135 said			0
this campaign , with its prominently featured stuffed animals , is eerily similar to a recent @entity157 fashion show , where scantily - clad models " dragged teddy bears down the catwalk , " she said			1
and as for the girls involved in the photo shoot , @entity135 believes they know how to portray a sexualized look			2
" i think the advertising world is trying to convince all of us that youth is the only good time of life , " dr. @entity135 said			0
" now it 's like , we 've been obsessed with youth , so we might as well have them be 6 years old			0
today 's girls equate pretty with ' trumped - up sexy			1
' " we have now said , as a society , that attractiveness today is constituted by a pornographied , voyeuristic look - at - me kind of sexuality			2
girls know it very well			2
if i say ' look pretty ' to a young girl , she lowers her chin , slants her eyes and turns to the side			2
that 's everywhere around them			0
" what we have taught them by posing them this way that there 's something about their bodies that is publicly consumable			0
" discussion : would you buy this kind of lingerie for your young daughter ? tell us in the comments section below .			1

new : @entity203 creator defends her brand and the photographs included in the ad campaign
@entity14 company @entity13 has designed a line of " loungerie " for girls ages 4 - 12
public outcry claims that the ads and lingerie are sexualizing young girls
people question whether it is the ad or the lingerie that is *inappropriate*
