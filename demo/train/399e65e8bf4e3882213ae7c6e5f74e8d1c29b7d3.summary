@entity1 , @entity0 has a tough task on its hands			0
not only does @entity7 look good , it plays well too -- and gameplay was always the area where @entity4 had the edge			1
@entity12 forward @entity11 is the cover star of @entity3			1
if you 've played a @entity4 game before you 'll know what to expect , which is both a plus and a minus , depending on your point of view			2
the ball pings around nicely , the weight of pass remains just about right and long passes are much improved			0
it mostly feels like a game of computer football should			0
the game plays fast and given shots from distance almost never fly in , scoring is still a challenge and goals still get you punching the air			0
for a series that 's always short on official team and league licenses -- leading to silly - sounding approximations of players ' names ( @entity39 anyone ? ) and daft team titles -- @entity4 gains the @entity44 , which is a small coup			1
read our @entity47 review here			0
game modes are much the same as before , including the venerable @entity51 , but the new addition of be a legend , where you try to take one player to the top , does not feel finished			2
the graphics are serviceable , with some player likenesses uncanny and others way off			0
the sound is no better than average and the commentary remains hit and miss. and it 's not unfair to say the game menus and their annoying and repetitive music are badly in need of a revamp			0
online play is not great and given the @entity71 and @entity72 are built for broadband multiplayer , @entity4 is lagging -- literally			2
you might say the game needs revolution rather than evolution and for next season 's release publishers @entity78 must up their game			1
nevertheless , @entity4 ' reputation is built on a fun offline two - player experience and nothing has changed there			1
@entity3 might not be cutting - edge in its presentation and options , but you still ca n't beat a 10 - minute match with a mate beside on you on the sofa .			1

@entity4 2009 is little changed from *previous* *incarnations* in the series
reviewer : while *flawed* , @entity3 is still good fun in offline two - player mode
