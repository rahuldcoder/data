editor 's note : @entity2 , the chairman of @entity3 for the past 11 years , co-produced the 1997 @entity5 movie " @entity6			1
" his mother , @entity7 , the sister of sen. @entity8 , founded @entity3 and his father , @entity9 , served as president			1
@entity12 's sister @entity11 , the wife of @entity14 gov. @entity13 , is a @entity3 board member			0

@entity2 says " @entity18 " perpetuates the worst stereotypes of intellectually disabled people			1
@entity19 ( @entity20 ) -- i am so proud of everyone who turned out to monday 's premiere of the film " @entity18 " to protest its unfortunate and humiliating portrayal of people with intellectual disabilities			1
prior to the premiere , i joined a large coalition of individuals and organizations to engage in discussions with @entity5 ceo @entity33 and others from the studio to express our concern over the film 's " @entity18 " subplot and the slogans , " @entity41 there was a retard , " and " never go full retard			1
" members of the @entity46 -- disabled advocates and family members of people with intellectual disabilities -- have seen the movie and reported shock and disgust			1
their reactions have resonated with many of us who take their cause and their voice with the utmost seriousness			0
while i am disappointed that we were not consulted in the same manner as other minority groups depicted in the film and that there are 17 mentions of the " @entity64 " with one mention of the " n - word , " i am grateful to ms. @entity33 for listening to the coalition and for taking steps to eliminate some of the film 's most offensive marketing elements			1
i am also appreciative of her commitment to working in the future for an end to denigrating speech and hurtful portrayals of people with intellectual disabilities in film and in society			2
@entity5 and its leaders have a powerful reputation for advancing socially and politically important issues			0
in particular , @entity83 has been a generous supporter of the work of @entity3 , for which i am deeply grateful			0
i look forward to counting the hopes and dreams of 200 million people with intellectual disabilities among the causes of this formidable group of creative and artistic leaders			2
now , however , is the time to raise our voices against " @entity18 " and the harm it is sure to visit on people with intellectual disabilities			1
together with the members of the international coalition , i am asking @entity83 , @entity33 , @entity100 and the entire " @entity18 " team to stop showing the film , and asking movie theaters and moviegoers to shut this movie out			1
" @entity18 " is a colossal blunder			2
do n't show or see " @entity18			1
" the degrading use of the word " retard " together with the broader humiliation of people with intellectual disabilities in the film goes way too far			1
when the r - word is casually bandied about and when bumbling , clueless caricatures designed to mimic the behavior of people with intellectual disabilities are on screen , they have an unmistakable outcome : they mock , directly or indirectly , people with intellectual disabilities			1
they perpetuate the worst stereotypes			0
they further exclusion and isolation			0
mockery in any form , or for any purpose or directed at anyone , especially those least able to defend themselves , is neither funny nor acceptable			1
we must work together to bring it to an end			0
as chairman of the @entity3 , i am inspired to be as vocal as possible about this important matter to effect positive change and to generate support for those who deserve our respect			0
name - calling is a subtle but malicious practice that only serves to perpetuate stigma , fear , intolerance and more			2
ireport.com : share your thoughts on ' @entity18 ' ridicule is a subtle but malicious practice that only serves to exclude and marginalize people with intellectual disabilities			2
" people with intellectual disabilities can be great athletes , productive employees , positive friends , courageous role models			0
let 's open our schools , doctors offices , businesses , communities , and most importantly , our hearts to the giftedness of every human being			0
some may think we ought to lighten up and not get so worked up because this is , after all , just a film			2
but films become part of pop culture and character lines are repeated in other settings time and time again			0
it 's clear to me that lines from this particular film will provide hurtful ammunition outside the movie theatre			0
while i realize that the film 's creators call this a parody and they never intended to hurt anyone , it does n't mean those words wo n't			2
how can you help ? @entity189 the r - word			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0

@entity9 : members of our group shocked and disgusted by " @entity18 "
use of the word " retard " and depiction of disabled go too far , @entity2 says
mockery of those least able to defend themselves is n't funny , he says
@entity2 : take a stand by banning the r - word and not seeing the film
