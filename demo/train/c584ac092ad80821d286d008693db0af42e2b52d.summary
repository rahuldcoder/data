@entity0 -- demonstrators angry that ousted strongman @entity4 's former premier will face off against a representative of the @entity6 in @entity8 's presidential runoff have called for more protests tuesday			1
on monday , several thousand protesters in @entity11 called on @entity8 courts to disqualify former prime minister @entity13 , chanting , " where is the revolution ? " others ransacked @entity13 's campaign headquarters and set it ablaze after learning that he was one of the two candidates who made it through the first round of voting			1
the june 16 - 17 runoff will pit @entity13 against @entity6 candidate @entity24			1
@entity24 received 5.7 million votes , followed by @entity13 's 5.5 million , according to @entity8 's election commission			1
@entity13 campaign spokesman @entity27 said the fire was soon contained and no one was injured			2
@entity27 said that while the @entity35 protesters numbered in the dozens , " supporters in the hundreds are outside the building supporting him			2
" in @entity11 , the epicenter of the 2011 revolt , the crowd carried @entity40 -- a presidential candidate who failed to make the runoff -- on their shoulders while demanding an end to the military government that followed @entity4			1
@entity46 protests were also reported in @entity47 and other cities , and revolutionary leaders said they would hold more on tuesday outside @entity8 's @entity50			1
voters ' dilemma : choice between two tyrants ? in all , 23 million of @entity8 's 50 million eligible voters , or 46 % , cast ballots in the first round of the election			1
thirteen candidates appeared on the first - round ballot , though two withdrew from the race after ballots were printed			2
the winner of the landmark vote will become @entity8 's first freely elected president			1
neither of the frontrunners had been favored by the revolutionaries responsible for toppling @entity4			0
@entity24 is an @entity69 - educated engineer who has promised to stand for democracy , women 's rights and peaceful relations with @entity73 if he emerges as the victor			1
still , he 's an @entity76 figure who has argued for barring women from the @entity8 presidency and called @entity73 leaders " vampires " and " killers			1
" though the @entity6 played little role in the revolution , its well - honed political machine succeeded in getting its supporters to the polls			1
meanwhile , many of those who faced down the @entity4 regime at @entity11 did not follow up with the political organizing that would have been needed to gain electoral victory			2
@entity13 , a former air force officer with close ties to @entity8 's powerful military , has attempted to distance himself from @entity8 's deposed leader			1
he told reporters last week that there 's " no going back " to the @entity4 years			2
still , he appealed to those who may have had second thoughts about the magnitude of the change that has swept across the country			0
the uncertainty has had an impact : last week , the @entity0 stock market plunged by 3 % in a single day			0
former @entity69 president @entity108 , who led a delegation observing the voting , told reporters last week in @entity0 that he could n't say " the entire process has been proper " because of restraints on observers			0
but the group found the election period to be peaceful , with citizens accepting the voting process as " quite successful			0
" " there were many violations , and i think each violation is serious			0
but i think collectively they did not affect the basic integrity of the election , " he said			0
@entity108 said there were no apparent patterns in election procedures that " favored a particular candidate			0
" @entity4 led the @entity132 nation for 30 years before being forced out last year amid a popular outcry that marked one of the seminal developments of the @entity136			0
distrust and anger in @entity8 , particularly against the military 's power in governmental affairs , have inspired continued protests , some of which have been marked by deadly clashes			1
many protesters are upset about what they see as the slow pace of reform since @entity4 's ouster			2
some are also concerned that the country 's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule			0
the @entity156 has insisted that it will hand over power to an elected civilian government			0
in january , two @entity76 parties -- the @entity159 with 235 seats and the conservative @entity161 with 121 seats -- won about 70 % of the seats in the lower house of parliament in the first elections for an elected governing body in the @entity169 era			0
