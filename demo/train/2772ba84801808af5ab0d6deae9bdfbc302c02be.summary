-- @entity1 , widely known as " the @entity2 of @entity3 , " has won 21 @entity5 titles and eight @entity3 in @entity3 , @entity6 -- more than any other athlete , male or female , in the 36 - year history of the event			1
@entity11 now serves as a coach , mentoring @entity14 champion @entity13 during his journey to @entity3 in 2013			2
she is working with olympian @entity17 for his trip to the @entity19			2
@entity0 asked her to offer some tips to the @entity22 triathletes , who are tackling the @entity23 next week			2
@entity0 : what are your top tips for newbies ? @entity1 : the first triathlon can be a pretty daunting task because there are three disciplines to master			1
here 's what i suggest : set up a training program that is grounded in the realities of your daily life			1
an overambitious plan can undermine mental and physical progress			2
set up a plan that focuses on becoming efficient and comfortable at the distances that you want to cover in each discipline			0
integrate a support network of family , training partners and tri clubs to keep your program on track			1
do n't overthink the equipment part too soon			0
getting in consistent swim , bike and run workouts is more important than gadgets and technology			1
being a competent swimmer is one of the most critical steps in building confidence , especially since it 's the first leg of a triathlon			0
swimming is the most " challenging " discipline to learn as a newbie and also very important from a safety perspective			1
when you do get into an event , always stay in the moment and do exactly what you have done in training			1
nothing much different happens in a race than happens in all those workouts you have logged , except that you have a lot of like - minded people around to cheer you on			1
@entity0 : explain the physical and mental training it takes to be a professional endurance athlete			1
@entity82 : being a professional athlete is much like being at the top of your game in anything			1
the commitment becomes part of the fabric of your identity			0
it is a fundamental aspect of daily life and how you interact with the world			1
each and every day is an assessment of your body and the training that needs to be done and all that goes with it : recovery , diet , lifestyle choices , and symbiotically , your mind has to embrace and adapt to that			2
as with anything , there are great days that have filled me with such joy and confidence , and there are the days that are a brutal struggle			2
being conscious of this ongoing engagement and partnership between mind and body is perhaps the greatest key to successful training as an endurance athlete			2
@entity0 : how do you know if you are ready to tackle your first triathlon ? @entity82 : from personal experience , i feel that the only way to find out is to get out there and do it ! even when armed with the mental knowledge and physical process of consistently executing a training program , only lining up and participating in an event will answer that question			1
so go do it ! @entity0 : what was your first triathlon ? @entity82 : my first triathlon was an @entity139 distance event held in @entity140			1
even coming from a swimming background , it was still nerve - wracking to see the distance laid out before me in the lake			0
my greatest anxiety came from doing an event that was going to last over two hours			0
despite all the years of being an athlete growing up , i was nervous about putting it all together for the first time			0
the event was successful despite " blowing up " on the run			0
the emotion and excitement of the start gun had me going out way too hard , and my legs were dead by the time i got to the run			0
it was a tough but rewarding experience to cross the finish line after how my legs felt when i got off the bike			2
i could not believe how tired they were and wondered how i was ever going to be able to " run " six miles			0
overcoming this mental hurdle marked the start of a great journey athletically and personally			0
@entity0 : how have your feelings about competing changed through the years ? does the " @entity2 " get race - day jitters ? @entity82 : years of experience have taught me how to keep perspective about competing			1
i fully understand that doing events is a celebration of hard work			0
knowing that not every day can be my best has made my experience less emotional			0
there are still a few butterflies at the start of an event , because who does n't want to have a " good " day versus a struggle ? i still get moments of anxiousness about not wanting to struggle through			0
then i remind myself that even if i do , i know how to handle it .			0
