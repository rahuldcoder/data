-- @entity1 has just launched a new tv series based on a novel by @entity4 called " @entity5 , " which in turn is based on the fundamentalist @entity8 idea of the rapture			1
apart from the title , which suggests a refrigerator full of stale food , the series looks promising			2
it 's a terrific premise : @entity15 returns and calls to heaven 140 million people , leaving behind billions of stupefied , confused , and grief - stricken others			1
in the show , a mother loses her baby , who disappears			0
a boy 's father seems to have vanished as he pushes a shopping cart			2
cars collide as drivers go missing			0
chaos strikes in the fictional @entity27 , @entity28 -- and throughout the world			0
how to cope ? the famous " @entity33 " series by @entity31 and @entity32 was already out there			2
it consisted of 16 best - selling novels on the same premise , and it 's about to come to the big screen again , in a film starring @entity40			2
the original film adaptation ( of three ) appeared in 2000			0
and then there is the @entity8 real - time strategy video game called " @entity33 : eternal forces			1
" if anyone has n't noticed , the rapture has become a commercial juggernaut , endlessly shape - shifting , finding new and highly entertaining outlets			1
but what about the theology behind this industry ? the rapture notion goes like this : @entity15 is coming back , and when he does , he will first return before a time of so - called tribulation begins , calling up into the clouds with him those who are " saved			1
" horrible suffering will then occur on the miserable @entity60 for seven years			0
then @entity15 will come yet again , for a final judging			1
there are many different versions of this scenario , so it 's difficult to summarize			0
it 's fair to say , however , that only fundamentalist @entity68 churches bother to think about the rapture at all			1
( @entity70 discount the idea completely			0
) the rapture concept is relatively new			1
it started with an @entity75 theologian , who in the 1830s invented the concept			1
this may come as a shocker to many , but it 's a fact : before @entity81 imagined this scenario in the clouds , no @entity8 had ever heard of the rapture			1
the idea was popularized by @entity86 , an @entity87 minister who published a famous reference @entity88 in 1908 , one that developed the idea of an elaborate series of final periods in history known as dispensations			1
@entity86 , like @entity95 , read the @entity96 as a vision of the future , not a fiery dream of the destruction of @entity101 by the @entity102 in a.d. 70			0
the latter view remains , in fact , the most common interpretation of the @entity96 by mainstream theologians and was described recently by @entity108 scholar @entity107 in " revelations : visions , @entity110 , and @entity112			0
" it 's a problem , however , for rapture - minded @entity8 that the word " rapture " does n't appear anywhere in the @entity88 , unless you 're willing to think in broadly metaphorical terms			1
rapture thinking is most often traced back to the @entity122 's first letter to the @entity123 , where he writes : " for the lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout of command , with the voice of an archangel and the trumpet of @entity132			1
the dead in @entity133 will rise first ; then we , who are left alive , will be snatched up with them on clouds to meet the @entity125 in the air ; and so we shall always be with the @entity125			0
" ( 1 thessalonians 4:16 - 17 ) first , it 's important to note that @entity15 himself never talked about the rapture , ever			1
we read in @entity142 about the " @entity143 coming in the clouds , " but this is a reference back to the @entity146 , where we get the image of a " son of man " who is actually going the other way , up to meet the @entity151			0
it 's all broadly metaphorical , a kind of dream			0
in @entity142 , the oldest gospel , this passage is about the vindication of @entity15 as he comes to heaven and is recognized as a true son of the father			2
in @entity160 , we read about a returning king , but close study of this passage suggests that @entity160 is talking about @entity132 coming back to @entity101 , not about @entity15 returning to @entity60			1
it 's clear from looking carefully at everything @entity122 says about the future , as in @entity167 15:51 - 54 or @entity168 3:20 - 21 , that he believes only that some day @entity8 will experience a kind of physical and spiritual change			1
they will be resurrected , but this is a complex term that suggests not necessarily resuscitation but evolution , a thorough transformation			0
in @entity123 , @entity122 is writing like the poet he is , creating a spectacular vision of a returning lord who will be given a great reception in the air			0
the crucial word in the relevant verse is " meet " : those who are left alive will be caught up on clouds to meet the @entity125 in the air			0
the word " meet " in @entity193 is " apentesis , " and it means to gather for a reception for visiting dignitaries			0
even the idea of being " snatched up " is thoroughly inadequate for the @entity193 word " harpazo , " which is better translated as " gathered " -- a point made by many biblical scholars over the years			2
in any case , @entity122 is being dramatic , imagining a holy reception committee that will greet the returning @entity133			0
and why not ? yet it 's amazing how scriptures get misused , and relatively new theological ideas -- such as the rapture -- get deeply embedded in certain circles			2
the rapture is really a plot device for popular entertainment and a bizarre theological teaching in fundamentalist circles , where it functions in a variety of ways			0
but it 's bad theology , and @entity15 himself would have been astonished to learn that thousands of years after him there were such notions afloat			1
at least he wo n't have to watch " @entity5 " on tv .			2

@entity220 : new @entity1 series takes off on novel based on @entity8 idea of ' the rapture '
he says it 's a fun tv idea , but the rapture concept is *rubbish* made up by theologian in 1800s
the idea is that @entity15 will come back , collect " saved " people before tribulation time begins
@entity220 : @entity88 does n't mention rapture . it 's *proponents* *distort* *apostles* ' metaphors to cook it up
