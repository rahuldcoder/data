the total lunar eclipse lasted about three and a half hours , starting as a partial eclipse about 1:33 a.m. et and finishing at 5:01 a.m. et , according to @entity7			1
as a coincidence , the eclipse fell on the same date as the 2010 winter solstice			1
the last lunar eclipse to happen on the day of the winter solstice was in 1638			1
" for eclipse watchers , this means that the moon will appear very high in the night sky , as the solstice marks the time when @entity21 's axial tilt is farthest away from the sun , " @entity7 said			2
in areas with clear skies , only watchers across @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 were able to see the eclipse			1
those in western @entity30 could see the beginning stages before the moon set , and stargazers in western @entity34 saw the later stages after moonrise , according to @entity7			0
