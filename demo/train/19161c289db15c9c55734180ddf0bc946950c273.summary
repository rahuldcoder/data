he 's sacrificing his safety			0
" @entity1 's life straddles the @entity42 and the @entity43			1
he is a dual citizen of the @entity43 and @entity13			1
born in @entity44 in 1963 , @entity1 spent much of his school and working life in the @entity43 , first in @entity47 and most recently in @entity5			1
he earned a bachelor 's degree in computer science and mathematics from @entity51 and then a master 's in business administration from @entity54			0
for more then a decade , he worked as a senior executive at an it firm in @entity17			0
2 years into @entity13 uprising , revolutionaries on dreams , cost a passionate @entity43 activist he 's married to @entity62 and they have four children			1
one of his sons , @entity66 , has worked for the opposition in @entity13 and was hurt in a bombing there			1
@entity1 supports the efforts of his son , who had been intent on going to law school but decided to help families in @entity13			1
" my son @entity66 consulted me at the beginning of the revolution , asking me to allow him to enter @entity13 to participate in the relief and first - aid work			1
with the difficulty of this situation , i agreed without hesitation			0
" " now he is working with his fellow revolutionaries to transfer facts and to help people in distress and i am proud of him			0
of course i wish from the almighty @entity88 to bring him safe to me and to return all @entity13 youths safely to their families unharmed and victors , " @entity1 said recently			1
during his years in @entity5 , @entity1 was active in community affairs , working as a board member at a @entity19 school , @entity98 , and the @entity99 , a nonprofit " dedicated to establishing an educational institution conducive to an @entity94 environment			1
" his wife teaches @entity101 at the academy and three of his children are graduates			0
the academy said that @entity1 's " management and leadership skills " helped the groups and fostered their successes			2
" during his time as a volunteer , we saw him as a practical man with great management experience			0
he was always open minded and open to debate			0
he conducted himself with the highest honesty and integrity , " the academy said in a statement			0
" his talent for bringing people together for the common good will be missed in our community			0
... his management and leadership skills benefited our organizations tremendously , " the academy said			0
as the @entity127 unfolded two years ago , @entity1 threw himself into @entity13 activism			1
he was a founder of the @entity129 , the @entity130 and the @entity131			0
" mr. @entity1 was a pioneer to raise funds to send direly needed humanitarian aid to @entity13 , as well as raise awareness of the events happening in @entity13 , " the @entity131 said in a statement			1
when he visited the region , he got involved with the opposition @entity140 and became the opposition 's humanitarian aid commissioner , charged with allocating and distributing relief in the areas seized from the @entity24 government , @entity138 said			1
several months ago , he took a leave of absence from his it work in @entity5 to focus on working with the @entity140 's @entity149			2
that entity is responsible for forging ties with nongovernment organizations and increasing the flow of @entity13 - bound aid			1
at a protest last year in @entity5 , walk for the child of @entity13 , @entity1 's passion against the @entity24 government was on bold display			1

he described the government 's violence against children , and pleaded for help from the dozens who came out to listen			2
" the @entity13 people , " he said , " are proud people			2
asking for help is not in our nature			0
this is something new to us			0
" but people who are dying of hunger or are injured there need help , he said , and help can come from @entity17 through donations			0
the humanitarian crisis stoked by the @entity13 civil war is so widespread that potential donors might be discouraged from thinking they can make a difference			2
@entity1 takes on that mindset			2
he hits home the message that local is global and global is local			0
" the situation in @entity13 is a disaster from a humanitarian perspective			2
do n't get to the point where you convince yourself that your donation and your contribution will not make a difference , " he said at a recent @entity138 banquet			0
" unless we pull together , all of us as individuals , and as countries , and as organizations , and try to figure out how to solve the problem of relief in @entity13 -- how to feed people -- then we 've got us a disaster of a magnitude that is beyond any one of us to handle			2
we 've got to act , and we 've got to act now			0
" the cost of war a political outsider takes the reins @entity28 , the @entity19 community leader in @entity17 , said he believes @entity1 is the perfect man for the job in @entity13 -- a hybrid of outsider and native			1
he 's hopeful that @entity1 will " come up with a solution that fits for the majority of people			2
" " at a time when there 's so much baggage in the @entity42 , they need an outsider			0
he 's an outsider in the sense of no political loyalties			0
" @entity1 has @entity232 heritage , one of the ethnic minorities in diverse @entity13			1
the general view about the civil war is that the @entity24 government is dominated by @entity238 , and @entity239 represent much of the opposition membership			2
but there are many more groups in @entity13 , ethnic and religious , and questions of allegiance or nonallegiance can be complicated and fluid			2
the choice of @entity1 suggests that the opposition is working to be inclusive			2
@entity1 earned the leadership post in a vote by @entity140 members on tuesday			2
he received 35 out of 48 votes during a meeting in @entity255 , where @entity13 opposition groups have been based			1
@entity257 , director of the @entity258 , said in an essay that many @entity13 will be suspicious of @entity1 and his support from the @entity261 -- a @entity239 movement regarded as hard - line by some and brutalized by the ruling @entity265 party since @entity24 's father , @entity266 , ran @entity13			1
" since the announcement , i have heard both @entity13 nationalist figures and those from some minority communities -- inside and outside the country -- talk dismissively about the move			2
" for them , he wrote , @entity1 is a " pawn of the @entity261			1
" " there is a sense that @entity1 's appointment has allowed the @entity261 , assisted by key regional actors , to walk in through the front door and assume control of @entity13 's opposition movement			1
" even if such views are " exaggerated , " they should be worrisome , @entity257 said			0
" the appointment of @entity13 's first interim prime minister should be a watershed moment for all @entity13			1
that it may not prove to be so , does not bode well for the impending @entity286 transitional period			0
" on wednesday , @entity43 rep. @entity287 , a @entity5 @entity288 , asked @entity289 , the @entity43 ambassador to @entity13 , about @entity1 's connection to the @entity261			1
@entity289 told @entity287 at a @entity292 hearing that he had met @entity1 twice			2
" he struck me as more texan than @entity261 , " @entity289 said			0
" i do n't know what his political affiliations are , but i do know that he also has a tolerant vision of @entity13 society			0
he is not a religious extremist , far from it			0
" @entity28 said the @entity24 government will try to associate @entity1 with the @entity261			1
but @entity1 is merely involved with the @entity19 community and is @entity43 , with all that means , he said			1
@entity1 will carry with him @entity43 values of liberty , justice and merit that transcend tribal and ethnic identity , @entity28 said			1
he is hoping that @entity1 's @entity43 citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the @entity43			1
the @entity261 rhetoric is " the typical thing to say for people that are more secular - leaning			2
rather than having political discourse to consolidate differences , many will use the ' @entity317 ' swear word as a focus to get most @entity321 support , " @entity28 said			0
with @entity1 's help , @entity28 said , one day @entity13 will mature and its peoples ' identities will be based on values , not tribe			1
but it 'll be a long haul , he said			0
" imagine being in a country where everyone spied on one another			0
people are highly suspicious , " he said , referring to the @entity24 police apparatus			0
" there are going to be a lot of taboos he 'll have to break			0
" @entity0 's @entity337 contributed to this report			0

new head of @entity13 opposition 's interim government is @entity13 - born , @entity43 - educated
@entity1 has lived and worked for years in @entity5
some @entity13 are suspicious of his support from the @entity261
" he 's one of those executives in a board room that impress you , " says a community leader
