-- eccentric former basketball star @entity1 may not have brought imprisoned @entity3 @entity2 back with him from @entity4 , but he did emerge with something to announce			1
along with representatives from @entity7 , an online betting company , he will put together a " basketball diplomacy " event involving players from @entity4 , he said monday			1
at a news conference , he called @entity12 , ruler of the repressive state , a " very good guy			2
" @entity1 also set tongues wagging over the weekend by leaking the purported name of @entity12 's baby daughter			1
returning from his second trip to the reclusive , nuclear - armed nation , @entity1 gave an interview sunday with @entity21 , a @entity22 newspaper , in which he described the " relaxing time by the sea " he spent with @entity12 and his family			1
' a good dad ' the personal life of @entity12 and his wife , @entity29 , is shrouded in secrecy			2
even his exact age remains unconfirmed by outsiders			0
( he is believed to be in his early 30s			0
) speculation sprang up last year that @entity29 might be pregnant after a photo carried by state media showed her wearing a long coat that could have been hiding a bump			0
but @entity4 authorities kept quiet about the matter			2
the flamboyant @entity1 , 52 , shed more light on the situation in his @entity21 interview , including the daughter 's name			1
" i held their baby @entity49 and spoke with ms. @entity51 as well , " he told the newspaper			1
he described @entity12 , who sits atop one of the world 's most repressive regimes , as " a good dad			1
" ruling dynasty the @entity12 dynasty has ruled @entity4 for three generations			1
@entity12 follows his father , @entity60 , and grandfather , @entity62			2
the regime has pursued the development of nuclear weapons while millions of its subjects have been left impoverished and malnourished			0
it 's a little early to start speculating whether @entity49 is a likely heir to her father , said @entity69 of @entity70 in @entity71			1
@entity69 , the author of the recent book " the @entity73 , " said the question of succession was unlikely to arise for at least another 30 years , assuming @entity12 remains healthy			2
" and i do n't believe the @entity4 monarchy is going to last another 30 years , " he said			2
if it does , @entity12 and @entity29 are young enough to have several other children in the meantime			2
" i would n't be surprised if they have five more , " he said			0
a big announcement ? @entity1 has so far made no mention on his @entity84 account of his bonding time with the @entity12 family			1
but he suggested late sunday something was afoot			0
" just returned from @entity4			1
huge announcement tomorrow morning in @entity90 , " he said in a post			0
it was unclear what he was specifically referring to			0
the @entity21 reported on his plans to organize a basketball game between @entity3 and @entity4 teams			0
@entity3 still imprisoned @entity1 had already poured cold water on speculation he might have been trying to secure the release of @entity2 , the @entity3 citizen serving a 15 - year sentence of hard labor in @entity4			1
" it is not my job to talk about @entity2 , " he told reporters at the @entity103 airport on saturday			0
" ask @entity106 about that , ask @entity108 about that , " @entity1 said			0
" ask those --- holes			0
" @entity1 had previously made no secret about his desire to help @entity2 , who has been transferred to a hospital after his health deteriorated			0
the retired @entity117 player once tweeted that he wanted @entity12 to " do him a solid " by freeing the @entity3 prisoner			0
but @entity1 's friendship with @entity12 , an avid basketball fan , does n't appear to carry enough weight to get @entity2 out of jail			1
@entity3 officials have repeatedly called on @entity4 officials to release @entity2 , who was convicted earlier this year of attempting to bring down the government			1
@entity126 last month abruptly withdrew an invitation to a @entity3 envoy who was to travel there to try to secure @entity2 's release			0
previous criticism @entity1 was criticized over his first visit to @entity4 , in february , during which he was pictured laughing and eating while watching a basketball game with @entity12			1
that visit came during a period of escalating tensions in which @entity4 threatened missile strikes on the @entity3 and @entity71			2
the situation has gradually calmed over recent months			0
in his comments to @entity21 on sunday , @entity1 , one of the greatest rebounders in @entity117 history , continued to defend the @entity4 's young leader			1
" @entity12 is a great guy , he loves basketball , and he 's interested in building trust and understanding through sport and cultural exchanges , " he said			2
@entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			0

new : " @entity156 diplomacy " event announced
he reportedly says that @entity12 's daughter 's name is @entity49
@entity1 has just returned from his second visit to @entity4 this year
