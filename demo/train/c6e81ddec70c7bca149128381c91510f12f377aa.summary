" training went well this week and the conditions were perfect today for a good performance			0
i know i can ski well in @entity12 , the slope suits me			2
it 's just that i never managed to have two clean runs together			2

" i am happy with today			0
it is an incredible feeling to race in front of so many people cheering for you ! i could hear them from top to bottom			0
of course it is not easy to race when everybody expects you to win			0
this adds a little bit of pressure			0
but there is another race tomorrow and i 'm looking forward to it			0

" this is the best victory one could have in a winter			0
@entity89 was my first and for sure it 's special , but winning @entity80 is something i wanted to do since i was about six years old so this is a dream come true , " the 23 - year - old said			1
