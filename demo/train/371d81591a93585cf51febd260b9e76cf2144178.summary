-- it was a moment of triumph amid a personal tragedy for @entity5 leader @entity4			1
in the early hours of tuesday morning , he could finally stand in front of his nation with news of a deal -- the breakthrough to release @entity13 's flight recorders from rebels ' hands , and , as important , to bring home the remains of the victims			1
@entity4 's own step - grandmother was on the flight , which was shot down near the @entity23 - @entity22 border last thursday			1
the second wife of his grandfather was flying to @entity5 to celebrate @entity26 -- the end of the fasting month of @entity28			2
as he comforted his own family , as well as others who had lost loved ones , the @entity5 leader was working to unlock a standoff that had generated a political firestorm , said a source close to the prime minister			1
where was the anger ? hundreds of bodies lay amid wreckage in an isolated field in what was described as " the world 's biggest crime scene			2
" they were being guarded by armed separatists who were refusing to give international monitors access to the site and material evidence			0
days after the crash , critics had started to question why the @entity5 leader had not made the same angry demands for answers heard from other world leaders			1
the @entity56 shot down over @entity23 was the country 's national carrier			1
it was carrying 298 people who trusted they 'd reach their destination			1
it was the second catastrophic event to hit the airline in five months , following the unprecedented disappearance of flight mh370			2
and , behind the @entity66 , @entity5 lost the greatest number of citizens on flight @entity13 : 43 people , including 15 crew			1
where was the @entity5 leader 's condemnation ? " it 's really important that he did not start blaming anyone before getting what he needed , " said @entity75 , a political commentator and ceo of the @entity78 in @entity79			1
" if he had taken an aggressive stance right form the beginning we may not get the bodies and the black boxes , " he said			0
strategy of ' quiet diplomacy ' from day one , according to the source , @entity4 had set his own diplomatic course ; a strategy of quiet diplomacy			1
working with a small group -- less than a handful -- he set about making personal contact with the self - declared leader of the @entity100 separatists , @entity98			2
although @entity4 was in touch with the leaders of @entity22 , @entity103 , @entity23 and the @entity104 , he was also using back channels to get to the man who controlled the crash site , the source said			1
" he is a well - connected man			0
he was talking to people who could contact @entity98 and eventually he came up with someone			0
and then he made personal contact , " the source told @entity0			0
the first contact was made last saturday , nearly two days after @entity13 was downed			2
from then on , the two had " numerous " conversations , the source said , including some on @entity4 's personal mobile phone			1
according to the source , @entity5 was regarded by the rebel leader as a non-aligned party in what had become a war of words between @entity22 and the @entity121			1
on top of that , the prime minister is seen by some as having a reputation as a deal - broker			1
he was instrumental in securing a peace deal between @entity130 separatists in the southern @entity131 and @entity132			0
were claims over-stated ? however , @entity4 's claims to have brokered the deal with the @entity137 rebel leader have been met with skepticism by some who say his role in the negotiations may be over-stated			1
" i think he wanted to do the right thing there -- he calls it quiet diplomacy			0
he calls it a victory ...			0
i do n't think it can be called a success , " said @entity149 from the @entity150 , @entity151			0
@entity149 said many of the bodies may have been handed over to authorities -- but not all of them			0
in addition , he said , the handover came much later than many @entity159 would have hoped			0
according to religious custom , bodies should be buried as soon as possible after death			0
the victims of @entity13 had been left in a field in @entity23 for three days before their removal			1
it 's also unclear what @entity5 promised the rebels in order to secure the deal , @entity149 added			2
international pressure was growing on @entity98 to co-operate with investigators , but @entity5 staff who were involved with the process believe the one - on - one contact was critical , and that a non-threatening @entity5 was the perfect negotiating partner			2
" this has been a huge success for @entity4 domestically			2
he is clearly more popular now , the opposition is siding with him , even his critics are praising him , " @entity178 said			0
prime minister under pressure after facing international criticism of the country 's handling of the @entity188 disaster , the prime minister was under pressure to prove he was able to act quickly and decisively in the case of @entity13			1
the relief that his diplomacy had paid off was palpable when @entity4 began to speak to the nation in a televised address			0
as he announced the deal with @entity98 , he also gave the first public hint of his strategy			0
" in recent days , there were times i wanted to give greater voice to the anger and grief that the @entity5 people feel			2
but sometimes , we must work quietly in the service of a better outcome , " he said			0
however , @entity178 said the real test of @entity4 's leadership will come when it 's time to speak out against the perpetrators			1
" the government should be more aggressive when there 's concrete evidence			0
when that happens , it 's very important to work with the international community , and to form a coalition to call for the perpetrators to be punished and brought to justice			0
" when that happens , it 's not really a matter of whether the pm is willing to be aggressive or not			0
he has to , otherwise it shows weak leadership , " he said			0
