ok , we can admit it			2
even though @entity4 spent six days in @entity5 posing in minimal clothing in below - freezing temperatures -- which she says led to hypothermia and frostbite -- we 're jealous			1
why ? um , because we do n't look like that in a bikini			2
@entity12 is the first model to be picked to do back - to - back covers for @entity16 's swimsuit edition since @entity17 appeared for the second time in 1997			1
and you only have to look at the photos to figure out why			2
fitness trainer @entity20 started working with @entity12 in august to prepare for the december photo shoot			1
we reached out to ask him about her exercise regimen , the biggest mistakes he sees clients make at the gym and why a strong mind is just as important as a strong body			0
@entity30 : what was @entity12 's training schedule like ? @entity20 : the idea was to step up the intensity and duration of the workouts , making it a strict cardio and sculpting boot camp that entailed body weights and resistance bands , sprinting and calisthenics , shadow - and kickboxing			1
at the beginning , we worked out seven days a week , twice a day			0
then we brought it down to five to six days a week for one hour a day			0
@entity30 : was there a specific area she needed or wanted to tone ? @entity20 : @entity4 has beautiful , feminine curves , and i did n't want her to lose a crazy amount of weight			1
the goal was to lengthen and tone her thighs and inner thighs , and keep her butt perky			0
it was n't about dramatically changing her body ; i did n't want to do that			0
just tighten , tone , lengthen			0
@entity30 : what was the most difficult thing for @entity12 ? what was the easiest ? @entity20 : most difficult for her was the sprinting -- getting up to a sprint was challenging			1
and the easiest was the boxing and kickboxing , mostly because she loved kicking my ass ! @entity30 : do you have a training motto or no. 1 rule for your clients ? @entity20 : my training philosophy is sound mind , sound body			1
that is my no. 1 rule			0
that and follow my abcs : no alcohol , bread or processed carbs			1
@entity30 : what is the biggest obstacle people face in getting to the gym ? @entity20 : i think the biggest obstacle for most people is that they do n't think they have the time to work out			2
but if you follow my advice and do my express workouts , or break your exercise into 10 - to 15 - minute increments throughout the day , you 'll find that you have plenty of time to exercise in small doses			0
@entity30 : what is the most common mistake you see people make while working out ? @entity20 : they do n't subscribe to my mind - body philosophy of training ; they 're not doing the correct exercise for their body type , or they 're distracted , socializing , using @entity115 instead of focusing and visualizing			1
@entity30 : give our readers the ultimate piece of advice -- something you 've learned over the years that they might not know			0
@entity20 : the mind is more powerful than any muscle in our body			2
with our mind focused , we can will ourselves to unbelievable greatness			0
we do n't imagine we 'll be posing on the cover of @entity16 anytime soon , but maybe with @entity20 's tips we wo n't be as afraid to shed our cover - ups come summer			1
