-- march 21 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 : disaster - affected areas @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : military action is underway in the skies over @entity4 , and the @entity18 is one of several countries involved			1
it 's our first story in the week 's first edition of @entity0			1
first up : @entity4 @entity24 @entity25 : it 's called " @entity29 , " and the goal is to enforce a no - fly zone over @entity4			1
the @entity31 @entity30 voted for that no - fly zone late last week			2
the coalition responsible for enforcing it is made up of forces from the @entity18 , @entity34 and @entity35 , among others			1
after the @entity30 's vote , @entity4 's government declared a cease - fire in its fighting with rebel forces			1
and it invited representatives from other nations to come to @entity4 to make sure the cease - fire was real			1
coalition forces were convinced that @entity4 leader @entity47 was not following the rules of the cease - fire			1
on saturday , the coalition attacked			1
you can hear the sounds of gunfire in the capital city of @entity55			2
a @entity18 commander said missiles landed near the capital and around other cities as part of these attacks			2
the fighting between colonel @entity47 's forces and rebels raged on in other cities , like @entity66			1
here , you can see a fighter jet that was shot down over @entity66 on saturday			2
admiral @entity68 , the chairman of the @entity69 , said on sunday that coalition forces had taken out most of @entity4 's air defense systems			1
but admiral @entity68 also said the @entity18 role in " @entity29 " would be limited , saying " we 're not going to put any boots on the ground			2
" colonel @entity47 ? he 's harshly criticized the other countries getting involved with the civil war in @entity4			1
he called the coalition forces " terrorists " and promised a " long - drawn war			1
" but sunday , a spokesman for the @entity4 military called for another cease - fire			1
@entity85 @entity18 president @entity86 : today , we are both also delivering assistance and support to the @entity5 people at their greatest hour of need			1
the ties that bind our nations to @entity5 are strong			1
in the @entity18 , we forged an alliance of more than sixty years			2
the people of @entity5 are some of our closest friends , and we will pray with them , and stand with them , and rebuild with them until this crisis has passed			1
disaster in @entity5 @entity25 : we 're starting to see some new effects of the nuclear crisis in @entity5 that resulted from a tsunami triggered by a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake			1
yesterday , the government health ministry banned the sale of spinach from the area near the @entity109 nuclear power plant			2
officials made that decision based on radiation levels that were over the government limit			2
there were already bans on the sale of raw milk and restrictions on produce from the area surrounding the nuclear plant			0
workers inside that power plant were starting to see some signs of progress over the weekend in their efforts to cool down these nuclear reactors			0
but officials say " even in the best scenario , there will be a lot of bumps ahead			0
" one they came across sunday was the possibility that they might need to release radioactive gas into the air			0
they would do that in order to release some of the pressure that 's building up inside one of the reactors			1
the tsunami knocked out the plant 's cooling systems , and getting those back online is crucial			1
@entity145 has a household comparison that helps explain why			0
@entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 : to get a sense of the challenge confronting the @entity5 at the @entity109 nuclear plant , consider this situation in a kitchen : a pot with no water on top of a high flame			1
obviously , this dangerous situation could cause a fire in here			0
well , stay with me			0
those spent nuclear rods can generate tremendous heat , up to 2,100 degrees			0
enough to melt them , burn them and send radioactive material into the atmosphere			0
they have to be kept under water , just like spaghetti when we 're cooking			0
now , those rods are normally kept under 30 feet of water , but according to the @entity173 , in at least one of the pools in @entity5 , the rods are exposed ; there 's virtually no water or no water at all			1
so , how do we resolve this situation ? well , if we do n't take the pot off the flame , we add water			0
and that is exactly what the @entity5 are trying to do right now ; any way they can , even dumping it from helicopters			1
they are trying desperately to get water into that pool to avoid a nuclear disaster			1
@entity145 , @entity0 , @entity149			0
@entity25 : there was some good news on sunday when rescue workers found an 80 - year - old woman and her 16 - year - old grandson			1
they 'd been trapped in their home for nine days			0
the news gave hope to other people whose loved ones are still missing			2
but as @entity200 explains , the search efforts are not easy			0
( begin video ) @entity202 , @entity0 national correspondent : @entity203 , @entity5			1
the scene behind me here is one of chaos , confusion ; it is surreal			0
if you see the video we took , you wo n't believe it			0
at least , we did n't when we saw it in person			0
so much debris , so much rubble			0
it is like a canyon			0
when we went down there , it 's like climbing a mountain			2
cars , boats , houses : pushed out of different neighborhoods , pushed out of different areas and blocking fire officials , military officials			0
they 're looking for survivors , the possibility of survivors , or trying to find bodies			0
we met a woman today who told us her father was at the second floor of his house , made the decision to stay in the second floor when the tsunami siren sounded			2
well , anyway , at this point , they ca n't get to the house			0
it appears the house is still there , but there 's so much rubble surrounding the house , there 's no way to check if this man survived			1
it 's just an absolutely incredible scene			2
it 's hard to imagine what the people here in northeastern @entity5 are going through			1
the death toll is rising rapidly			2
we know it will continue to rise			0
we ourselves , just myself and my crew , found a body in the back of a car			0
this is how they 're finding bodies , the officials			0
there 's so much rubble down there they ca n't get to			2
it 's very likely that it will be weeks or months before they come anywhere close to knowing what this death toll is			1
last night , while we were sleeping , we felt at least six or seven sizable aftershocks , and that only increases the anxiety that people feel here in northeastern @entity5			1
this is @entity200 , @entity0 , in @entity5			1
( @entity286 ) impact your world @entity25 : a lot of you have been asking on our @entity291 page about how you can help the victims of this crisis			0
in the @entity297 section on our homepage , that 's @entity299 , click on " @entity300			2
" you 'll get a list of the organizations helping out with relief efforts and learn how you can be part of them			0
for more information about what 's going on in @entity5 or about any of the stories we cover in our show , you can always check out the in - depth section at @entity299			1
@entity312 @entity25 : @entity7 : a nation still struggling to recover from a devastating earthquake that hit it more than a year ago			0
it 's also trying to resolve a presidential election from last november			2
none of the candidates got enough votes for an outright victory			0
yesterday , @entity7 headed to the polls to vote in a runoff election			0
one candidate is a former law professor and first lady			0
the other is a @entity7 entertainer			0
there were some problems early on at a couple polling locations : missing ballot boxes , and not enough ink to mark who had voted			0
but officials said those issues were resolved by later in the morning			0
the final results of the runoff are scheduled to be released in mid-april			0
@entity337 @entity338 , @entity15 : a big @entity337 today is dedicated to mr. @entity340 's class in @entity341 , @entity342 ! which word best describes the moon 's orbit around the @entity346 ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) circular , @entity351 , c ) elliptical or @entity353 ) @entity354 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the moon moves around the @entity346 in an elliptical orbit			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity361 @entity25 : well , if you looked outside and thought the moon looked bigger and brighter than usual this weekend , it 's because it was ! because of that elliptical orbit around the @entity346 , full moons look different			1
and this full moon this past saturday was the closest one to @entity346 in 18 years			1
it 's called a super perigee moon			1
@entity370 being the point on the moon 's orbit when it 's closest to @entity346			1
the opposite point -- when it 's at its farthest point from @entity346 -- is called apogee			1
if you did n't get a chance to see the special event over the weekend , you 're just gon na have to be patient			0
the next super perigee moon will show up in the year 2029			2
before we go @entity25 : we had to do some digging to find today 's before we go segment			1
but it 's nothing compared to what these folks are going through ! it 's the 33rd @entity390			2
three days of hauling , pounding , drilling , all to show off a mastery of mining			0
33 teams come from colleges all over the world for the annual event			0
how do you get through three days of intense , physical competition ? goodbye @entity25 : it 's simply a case of mine over matter			2
we 're gon na cart ourselves out of here			0
we 'll see you then			0
