an angry @entity0 , the @entity1 chairwoman , warned again monday she would investigate why the @entity2 did not notify oversight committees about its investigation into cia director @entity5 after the bureau determined he was having a secret and risky extramarital affair			1
" ... a decision was made somewhere not to brief us , which is atypical , " the @entity9 @entity8 told @entity11 's @entity10 about how the top @entity12 and @entity13 on the @entity15 and @entity1 intelligence committees are usually briefed on key developments			1
" this is certainly an operationally sensitive matter			0
but we were n't briefed			0
i do n't know who made that decision			1
" opinion : how @entity5 courted the press section 501 of the @entity27 spells out the requirements for the executive branch to inform the congressional intelligence committees of key intelligence - related activities			1
" the president shall ensure that the congressional intelligence committees are kept fully and currently informed on the intelligence activities of the @entity36 , including any significant anticipated intelligence activity as required by this title , " the statute reads			1

" spokesman : rep. @entity47 knew of inquiry in october " my concern has actually escalated the last few days , " she said			0
on sunday , she told @entity51 an investigation of the @entity2 was needed because the illicit affair " could have had an effect on national security			1
" one specific national security concern deals with whether @entity57 , the woman with whom @entity5 had an affair , was privy to classified information			2
in a speech at the end of october , @entity57 suggested the terrorist attack on the @entity36 @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 , took place because the @entity36 was housing @entity65 prisoners there -- a theory , she noted at the time , that had not been vetted yet			0
" i do not know how she got that information , " @entity0 said			2
" we should find out			0
" the claim by @entity57 has since been discounted by administration officials			0
scandal is about much more than sex @entity0 also was incensed that an @entity2 whistle - blower -- who may have feared the investigation into @entity5 was n't proceeding properly -- had complained to the office of @entity15 majority leader @entity47 , @entity79 , who then was aware of the investigation even before president @entity81 was informed			1
@entity0 's committee will meet privately tuesday to determine how it will proceed on the @entity2 matter			1
it is important " that we have an orderly process , that we not jeopardize anyone 's rights , that we be respectful , " she said , adding that some of the investigation will be done in public and some of it will be behind closed doors			0
separately , the committee is conducting an investigation into the fatal attack on the consulate in @entity64			0
@entity5 was to testify before a closed hearing thursday into the attack , but he will now be replaced by acting cia director @entity98			2
" disciplinary action " could be in order , @entity0 said			2
profile : who is @entity57 ? @entity0 said she wants to read a " trip " report that she was told @entity5 filed on his just - concluded visit to @entity64 , where he personally investigated the circumstances of the attack			1
but after a second person told her the report had not been written yet , @entity0 warned she would move to have it subpoenaed if necessary			2
