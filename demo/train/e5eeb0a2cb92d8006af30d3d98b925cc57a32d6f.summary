-- @entity1 waits outside a local fried chicken restaurant in @entity3			1
crouching near to feral cats and rubbish bins , she is n't there to meet friends for dinner but to search through the diner 's trash bags			1
" i 'm sorting the garbage , looking for ' pagpag ' , " she says			2
in @entity12 " pagpag " means the dust you shake off your clothing or carpet , but in @entity1 's poverty - stricken world , it means chicken pulled from the trash			1
@entity21 is the product of a hidden food system for the urban poor that exists on the leftovers of the city 's middle class			1
@entity1 is the merchant and pays the trash dealer just over a dollar for tonight 's supply of garbage and scraps			1
in the dim haze of the street lights , she holds up a half - eaten chicken breast			2
" this one , this is meat , " she says			0
" now what we do at home is clean it , put it in plastic , and then i sell it in the morning			0
it 's very easy to sell because it 's very cheap			2
people in my neighborhood want very cheap food			2
" " if it 's mostly bones , it 's 20 pesos ( $ 0.50 ) per bag , " she says			2
after bagging up the chicken scraps she heads home to @entity56 , a neighborhood infamous in the @entity58 as one of the poorest slums in @entity3			1
at dawn , about six hours after @entity1 first got her trash delivery , she begins to divide up the pagpag			1
@entity1 sniffs the chicken , which she says has a bad , sour smell			2
she 's disappointed that she only has five bags to sell this morning that will sell out in just minutes			1
" pagpag ! " @entity1 calls out , as she walks through the slums carrying her small cart			1
@entity70 , a 27 - year - old mother of two , is the first customer			0
@entity70 lives in a shanty that sits on top of one of @entity3 's biggest garbage dumps			1
she does n't have the 20 pesos to pay @entity1 until her husband comes home that evening			0
for him , 20 pesos is full day 's pay , says @entity70			0
@entity70 's toddler son , @entity78 , wails as she first washes the chicken , heats the pot and adds vegetables to the pagpag , which is mostly bones			1
" sometimes it comes from the garbage , " she says , as she hands a small , half - eaten chicken wing to her son			0
@entity70 , and others like her , have no other choice but to eat pagpag , says @entity91 , a social development specialist and a volunteer at the @entity94 ( @entity94 )			0
" it is a private humiliation of the poor to have to eat off someone else 's plate			1
but it 's a survival mechanism for the poorest of the poor , " she says			1
the @entity101 is based in @entity3 and has built an elementary school in the heart of the @entity56 slums			1
@entity94 's school educates 450 of the most poverty - stricken children in @entity56 , with the aim of freeing families from poverty			0
the school survives on donations and provides students with two meals a day			0
@entity114 , @entity94 's manager of health and nutrition , says that when the school first opened she was treating children with a range of illness and disease			0
" even though they cook the food , the disease is still there , " she says			0
@entity114 says that parents know pagpag is not a good source of food for their children , but that they do n't have any choice			2
" they 're being pushed to do that thing because they do n't have enough money to buy the food that they should prepare , " she says			0
for @entity70 this is all that she can afford and it 's better than nothing			0
" by the mercy of @entity142 , this is enough , " she says .			0
