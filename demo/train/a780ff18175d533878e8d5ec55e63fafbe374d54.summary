-- the bad news came via certified letter to @entity3 , @entity4 and nearly 17,000 other @entity5 this month			1
thousands last week protest government layoffs in @entity5			1
to cut spending , @entity5 announced last month that thousands of government employees would be fired in the second round of layoffs this year			1
more than 7,800 public employees were fired in march			1
" i was fearful because of the uncertainty , " @entity3 , 42 , an auxiliary administrator for the @entity14 territory 's @entity12 told @entity0			0
" will the letter come or not come ? " the letter came , and it said that under a measure authorized by an emergency fiscal bill , her last day of work would be january 8 of next year			0
@entity4 , who worked for the education department for 11 years as a receptionist , got the same letter , but with a november 6 termination date			0
" it was as if the world collapsed , " she told @entity0			0
and presumably , so it goes for the thousands of other public employees who were laid off			1
the austere measures are a bid by the government to stabilize a fiscal mess and save @entity5 's credit rating			1
according to government figures , the @entity14 territory faces a $ 3.2 billion budget deficit -- proportionally , the largest shortfall in the @entity14 -- and is entering a fourth year of recession			1
the severity of the plan reflects the aftermath of what experts say is years , maybe decades , of the lack of a forward - looking economic policy			0
confronted with the fear that the credit - rating agencies might reduce @entity5 's rating to junk status , the administration of gov. @entity49 has taken strong , but controversial , steps			1
" every layoff letter has a name , and every name has a story , " @entity5 secretary of state @entity55 said in an interview with @entity0			1
but , he said , " doing nothing was not an alternative			0
" the governor and other officials cut their salaries and trimmed spending in other areas , but the massive layoffs were necessary to avert the downgraded credit rating , @entity55 said			1
" if that happened , we would become the first state in the history of the @entity14 to have its credit downgraded to junk bond , " he said			2
@entity5 's unemployment rate is nearly 16 percent , according to the @entity14 @entity78			1
according to government calculations , a downgraded credit rating would have pushed that figure toward 25 percent unemployment , @entity55 said			2
the government is betting that the reduced spending , combined with $ 6.5 billion in combined federal and local stimulus funds , will be enough to get the territory back on solid footing			2
as a @entity14 commonwealth , @entity5 exercises much autonomy , but still falls under @entity14 jurisdiction			1
in addition to the federal stimulus money , @entity5 officials traveled to @entity95 last month to lobby for discretionary stimulus grants			1
how did @entity5 get into this predicament ? " this did not happen overnight , " said @entity98 , executive director of the @entity99 , an independent think tank in @entity5			1
for too long , the island has been dependent on a single industry at a time , @entity98 told @entity0			0
first it was coffee , then sugar , and most recently pharmaceutical production plants			0
under the terms of a special tax break , @entity14 companies were exempt from paying federal income tax on profits earned by their @entity5 manufacturing subsidiaries			1
this brought plenty of companies and jobs to the island until @entity118 voted to phase out the benefits between 1996 and 2006			0
when a number of foreign companies began to pull back , @entity5 saw that the local economy had not absorbed many benefits from the foreign plants , @entity98 said			1
for instance , local restaurants did n't sprout near the plants because food was usually done in - house			0
likewise , the foreign companies used their own accountants , leaving local @entity132 few opportunities to grow			0
" that was n't the cause , but it laid bare that we had n't had an economic development model in a long time , " @entity98 said			0
on the fiscal front , most the attention has focused on the large public workforce			2
with a workforce of some 200,000 , @entity5 , with a population of about 4 million , has more public employees than any state in the union , with the exception of @entity147 and @entity148 , @entity55 said			1
for comparison , @entity147 has about one state employee for every 103 residents , while @entity5 has one public worker for every 20 residents			1
the public payroll had become bloated , he said			2
@entity157 , director of the center for @entity159 at @entity160 , said that a large public workforce is not a bad thing , as long as it adds and keeps up to the territory 's growth			2
but even when @entity5 's economy started declining , the public sector continued to swell			1
the territory 's political parties had become dependent on government employment as a political tool , in effect creating a patronage system , @entity157 said			2
" we are where we are because the patronage system is bankrupt , " he said			0
for @entity49 , a member of @entity5 's pro-statehood @entity177 and also member of the @entity179 , the challenges required immediate action			1
" you can bring it down to a four word phrase : ' no pain , no gain , ' " @entity55 said			0
the government has already spent more than $ 1 billion in stimulus funds that have created some 10,000 private sector jobs , he said			1
" that 's why we are stimulating the private sector to grow , so that it can pick up the slack that the government can no longer afford to employ on its own , " @entity55 said			2
thousands of protesters who participated in a strike last week dispute that firing this many workers during a recession will help the territory			2
" this worsens the situation by increasing unemployment , " @entity199 , president of the @entity200 , told @entity0			0
" we want the government to take alternative measures			2
" the government 's bet is that the negative impact of the laid off workers will be offset with positive effects of the stimulus funds , @entity98 said			2
it 's a risky bet , he said , adding that the @entity49 administration grasps the economics of the situation very well			0
looking to the future , @entity55 said the government expects to balance the budget in two years			0
@entity218 said that recovery will also mean looking at diversifying the economic activity			0
tourism and agriculture , for example , could become larger factors in the economy , he said			0
@entity199 , the union leader , said he supports levying higher corporate taxes to increase revenue			0
the government , however , said it plans to continue to use tax incentives to lure companies to the island			0
@entity5 is " still the pharmaceutical capital of the world , but we have to try to manufacture even more @entity235 to resolve our economic headaches , " @entity55 said			1
" we have to manufacture even more viagra than we already manufacture so our economic statistics will rise			0

@entity5 announced last month thousands of government layoffs
already more than 7,800 public employees were fired in march
@entity5 , population 4 million , has 200,000 public employees
@entity147 has 1 state employee for every 103 residents , @entity5 , 1 for every 20
