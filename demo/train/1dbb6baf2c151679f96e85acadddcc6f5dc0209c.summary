-- within weeks of @entity6 student @entity4 's death in the vibrant college town of @entity8 , @entity9 , prosecutors and police declared the case closed			1
they 'd seized two knives in their search for the murder weapon			1
they took dna from the room where @entity17 was killed			1
and at least one suspect had confessed to being at the murder scene			1
@entity17 had been stabbed in a sexual misadventure , officials said			0
and they knew the killers			0
@entity25 @entity24 , @entity17 's roommate ; @entity9 @entity27 , @entity29 's boyfriend ; and @entity30 native @entity4 , a drifter known in the area , had their pictures splattered across the world 's media			1
@entity29 's photo was even hung in the police plaza alongside @entity9 's most infamous mobsters and criminals			1
the prosecution case seemed a sensational slam - dunk , almost too good to be true			1
@entity29 's supporters say that 's because it is			0
" in the beginning , all of this supposed evidence was being leaked , showing what sounded like a pretty convincing case , " @entity46 , a lawyer and former prosecutor working with the group @entity49 , told @entity0			1
the case could n't look more different depending on where you stand			1
@entity29 's murder trial is entering its final stages , with closing arguments beginning november 20			1
the jury will begin deliberating december 4			0
but there is still no agreement on the key pieces of evidence that prosecutors say convict her and the defense says clear her			1
@entity70 : how we examined the evidence in @entity29 's corner : her friends and family from @entity77 , @entity78			1
for them , she is the victim - railroaded by an overzealous @entity9 prosecutor , who faces charges of prosecutorial misconduct in another case			1
@entity29 's supporters say he 's tried to force the evidence to fit his theory of what happened			1
and with negative and often false details about the case appearing in the press - all for the jury to read - @entity29 supporters fear she could be convicted regardless of the facts			1
on the other side : @entity8 's prosecutor @entity94			0
for him and his colleagues , the answer is simple - @entity97 , @entity29 and @entity27 are all responsible for leaving @entity17 partially clothed , strangled and with her throat cut on november 2 , 2007			0
see a timeline of the case the knife the crime scene was gruesome			1
the 21 - year old @entity6 student was found under a duvet on the floor by her bed , covered in blood			1
a bloody handprint was streaked on the wall above her			0
a source close to the prosecution says @entity17 was held down while she was strangled and stabbed			0
the source says @entity27 's 6 Â½ - inch kitchen knife was used to slit her throat and then taken back to his apartment			0
it is perhaps the biggest piece of evidence the prosecution has presented against @entity29			1
@entity29 's dna is on the handle and that of @entity17 is on the blade , said a source close to the prosecution who did not wish to be identified discussing an ongoing case			1
@entity17 had never been to @entity27 's apartment and would n't have come in contact with the knife , he said , yet there was her dna			1
those " unmistakable facts " show the knife played a role in the murder , the source said			1
@entity46 and experts testifying for the defense say there is no way the knife could be the murder weapon			1
dr. @entity142 , a leading forensics expert in @entity9 , testified that the knife taken from @entity27 's apartment would n't have made the wounds on @entity17 's body			1
" it does n't match the size or shape [ of the wounds , ] " @entity46 told @entity0			0
" and @entity27 's knife also does n't match a bloody outline of a knife left on the bedding			0
" @entity46 , who offered her legal advice pro bono to the @entity29 family , questioned the validity of the dna evidence , saying the knife had been " improperly transported in a shoe box			1
" watch @entity24 's parents discuss the case furthermore , @entity46 said the jury heard from defense expert @entity162 , a geneticist and private coroner in @entity9 , who said that the dna sample was too small to be definitive			1
@entity46 said the presence of @entity29 's dna on the knife handle was no surprise , as the couple had dinner at his house occasionally			2
prosecutors say just because the knife does n't match everything does n't mean it was n't used			0
the source close to the prosecution said it was possible , based on the wounds , that several different items made them			0
damning dna or ' @entity181 ' on the night @entity17 was killed , @entity29 and her boyfriend say they were at his house watching a movie and smoking hashish			2
their recollection of events , they admitted , was hazy from the drugs , but both swore they went back to the house the next morning			0
@entity29 says she was unable to gain entry - and called police			0
for their case , prosecutors had to prove that @entity29 and @entity27 - who had recently started dating - were lying and place them at the home when @entity17 was killed			2
some reports spoke of a scurry of people - more than one - on the night of the murder around the house			2
it was a positive lead for prosecutor @entity94 - but came to nothing in court			0
but the prosecution had more evidence in the form of a bra clasp , one that fell to the floor after the murderer cut @entity17 's bra in half before she was killed			2
and on it was @entity27 's @entity166			0
@entity46 says that evidence on the clasp is fundamentally flawed , like much from the crime scene collection , calling the work " @entity223 forensics			2
" " in the [ crime scene ] video , you can see it went from being white in color to nearly black because it got so dirty being moved around , " @entity46 said of the clasp , noting that tainted the only evidence that placed @entity27 at the scene			2
@entity46 described other errors she saw on the crime scene video			0
" they were putting their fingers in @entity17 's wound , they were shaking out evidence , picking up hairs and dropping them , " she said			2
" some people did n't wear gloves or had their hair draping on the floor , they crashed into a window at one point and threw aside evidence			2
it was just wrong on all levels			0
" the prosecution source maintains the crime scene was handled properly , and the evidence shows what it shows			2
the source says it 's up to the defense to prove otherwise			2
biggest case for @entity9 or the ' greatest travesty ' ever ? @entity29 's introduction to the world came in a whirlwind of tabloid headlines			1
the prosecution touted hard evidence early that they said unquestionably showed they had their killers			2
there was a footprint in @entity29 and @entity17 's bathroom that was attributed to @entity27 - though later analysts admitted it belonged to @entity97 , who was convicted of @entity17 's murder in 2008			2
the prosecution also presented what they called a confession by @entity29 , but @entity29 later said any apparent admission she was at the scene was made when investigators told her to imagine what she might have seen if she had been there			0
the argument became moot when a higher court ruled the alleged confession could not be used because the statement was made without an attorney or translator present			2
the tabloid headlines continue as the trial closes			2
media around the world focus on @entity29 's sexual history , what clothes she wears to court and whether a bump on her lip means the girl they dubbed " @entity24 " has herpes			1
it 's all a distraction from the lack of evidence , @entity46 said			0
" it 's the greatest travesty of a prosecution ever , " @entity46 said			0
" it 's so ludicrous			0
you 've got to have a theory , or a motive , but the theory has to fit the facts somehow			0
and in this case , there 's no solid evidence , no motive and no match whatsoever			1
" @entity29 's supporters maintain that the prosecution did get one thing right - putting @entity97 behind bars			0
he chose a fast - track trial , separate from @entity27 and @entity29 , and was convicted of murder and attempted sexual assault and sentenced to 30 years			1
they believe he was @entity17 's sole killer			0
he is appealing the verdict			0
they believe @entity29 and @entity27 are only being prosecuted because they were flaunted so publicly as the killers , and it would look bad for officials to admit they got it wrong			0
the prosecution source rejects that , and portrays @entity29 , @entity27 and @entity97 as three people who together ended the life of the young @entity6 woman			0
and they say the way @entity29 originally pointed the finger at another man - who was cleared with an alibi - shows she had something to hide			0
both sides agree the truth is in the evidence , and it will soon be for the jury to decide which version they believe			1
@entity0 's @entity347 and @entity348 contributed to this report .			0
