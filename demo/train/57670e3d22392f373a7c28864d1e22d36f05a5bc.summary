-- calling all ladies ! the stunning landscapes of @entity3 create the perfect spot for an adventurous girls vacation			1
no , i 'm not suggesting you plot a " @entity9 " - type western getaway and wildly escape from your men and the police			2
instead , relax with your favorite girlfriends ( legally ) and soak up the beauty of the mountainous landscape and all the experiences the area between @entity18 's famous @entity17 and the @entity19 has to offer			1
this spring , two girlfriends and i met in @entity21 to start our western road trip			2
check out our itinerary , and use it as a guide for ideas on building your western trip			2
@entity21 to @entity19 ( 233 miles ) we flew into @entity21 , but this was n't a trip about big cities , so we high - tailed it out of the @entity32 in our rented @entity33 and drove 4½ hours north along @entity34 and 40 and @entity35 toward the @entity19			1
as we traveled along these scenic highways , the vegetation changed from saguaro cactuses to tall pine trees			0
the towering @entity41 peaks near @entity42 were a highlight of the dramatic scenery along our route			0
the peaks are a volcanic mountain range and provide a number of recreational opportunities , from snow skiing to hiking			2
@entity19 we arrived at the southern entrance to the @entity19 , just north of @entity51 , right before sunset and had our cameras ready			1
the park guides said @entity56 and @entity57 points are some the best places to view a sunrise or sunset , and they did n't lead us astray			0
for dinner , we dined inside the park 's @entity62 ( which is just a few feet from the canyon rim ) at the @entity66			2
the restaurant specializes in hand - cut steaks , and fish and chicken inspired by flavors of the @entity72			2
one of its signature drinks is the @entity75 , which includes @entity76 , prickly pear cactus syrup , lime , @entity79 and sweet and sour mix. both the food and drinks were excellent			0
we stayed outside the park , where rates are generally cheaper , but we admired @entity85 , the park 's priciest and most famous lodge			2
built in 1905 , famous guests over the years have included @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , to name a few			0
the hotel was also featured in the 1983 @entity93 film " @entity94			0
" the following morning , we met our tour bus outside the @entity62 for a guided view of the national park			0
( we used the @entity19 's official website to find our tour operator			1
) our bus ride covered 52 miles in a little under four hours as we traveled east from the lodge along the rim of the canyon			0
the tour stopped at @entity106 , touted as the most scenic viewpoint on the @entity109 drive			0
the @entity110 , designed in the 1930s by famed architect @entity112 in the style of the ancestral puebloan people , also offered stunning -- even soul - enriching -- views of the canyon			1
the @entity19 offers endless opportunities for exploration , beyond what we discovered during our 24 - hour visit			1
thousands of visitors each year hike the park 's various trails , bike along the @entity126 trail and paved roads , enjoy airplane and helicopter tours , and brave rafting trips and mule rides			1
@entity19 to @entity18 ( 119 miles ) : the diverse landscape during our southbound road trip between the @entity19 's @entity19 and @entity18 kept us busy with our cameras			1
in @entity136 , the scenery ranges from deserts and ponderosa pine forests to volcanic peaks			0
@entity140 in @entity136 ranges from 2,600 feet to 12,633 feet at the summit of @entity142			0
a snowstorm caught us during a small portion of the drive , but we ended the journey with sunny skies in @entity18			1
i 'd never seen such extreme climate changes in a 120 - mile trip until this excursion			2
@entity18 area @entity18 's main attraction is no doubt its stunning array of red sandstone formations , enveloped in the area 's celebrated spiritual energy			1
the @entity17 provided a truly awe - inspiring backdrop for our outdoor adventures			1
but first , shopping -- naturally a part of many girls trips , and ours was no exception			0
@entity18 is filled with art galleries , boutiques , @entity167 metaphysical shops , antiques and even an outdoor shopping mall			1
be sure to pick up made - in - @entity18 cactus jellies , @entity172 crafts or even healing gemstones during your visit			1
a skeptic finds inner peace in @entity18 our first big adventure ( beyond shopping ) was a two - hour off - road tour in an open - air jeep			1
our professional driver , who doubled as an informative tour guide , showed us geologic formations and some of the trademark @entity186 formations			0
there are numerous outfitters who provide @entity192 tours , and prices vary , depending on the type of excursion you select			1
we decided to bundle our jeep tour with a 1½ - hour horseback riding trip near the banks of the @entity200 in @entity201 , @entity3			1
during our horseback riding adventure , in a place ironically called @entity204 ( none of our horses died on this trip , by the way ! ) , we rode under cottonwood and sycamore trees and enjoyed the panoramic views of @entity212			1
we finished our excursion with a picnic lunch near the horse arena , which was included in the tour package			0
back at our hotel in @entity18 , we hopped into our trusty rental car and wandered to an amazing piece of architecture -- the @entity221			2
from some angles , the chapel looks as though it 's rising from @entity18 's famed rock formations , and many comment that the structure has " universal appeal " because of its unique design			1
construction of the chapel was completed in 1956 to wide acclaim , and it was designed by @entity232 , a former student of legendary architect @entity234			0
and while we did n't necessarily find religion during our visit , we fantasized what it might be like to get married in this church			0
but that will remain a fantasy , since the chapel does n't perform wedding ceremonies			0
a skeptic finds inner peace in @entity18 we finished our day with a visit to the spa , since @entity18 is known for its spa treatments			2
( @entity249 are many girls trips ! ) i selected a package called @entity253 , where i received a psychic reading , followed by a one - hour massage			2
the reading was marketed as a way for " clearing the old and expanding the new energies inside of me			0
" we felt refreshed from our treatments and walked away from the experience more relaxed than when we first started			0
i 'm not sure if i bought into the psychic reading , but it was interesting to hear what my future may hold			0
day trips from @entity18 the area around @entity18 is rich in @entity267 and native american culture and history			2
during our visit , we hopped into our rental car and explored some nearby cliff dwellings , including @entity273 and the @entity274			0
these ruins of cliff dwellings ( plus many more we did n't have time to visit ) stand as a monument to the ingenuity of the ancient people who built them hundreds of years ago			0
trips to both locations were about a 25 - minute drive from our @entity18 hotel			1
another highlight of the trip was a visit to @entity289 , @entity3 , a historic copper mining town that has transformed itself into a quaint tourist town filled with shops and eateries			1
we enjoyed a mouth - watering lunch at the @entity297 restaurant , which we 're told is a favorite among locals for its juicy , thick burgers			0
we capped our trip with a visit to a winery region along @entity304 , about 15 miles south of @entity18			1
( we had a designated driver ! ) wine producers say cool nights and mild winters make ideal growing conditions for reds like merlot and cabernet			0
it was a perfect ( and tasty ) ending to a fabulous girls trip .			1

@entity3 provided a perfect backdrop for the author 's girls trip
the @entity19 and @entity18 offered a good mix of outdoor adventure and relaxation
