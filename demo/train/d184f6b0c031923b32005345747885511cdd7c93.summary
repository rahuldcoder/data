@entity3 's deputies delivered the fatal wound that killed a man who , along with his wife , gunned down two police officers and a civilian in @entity9 on sunday , a sheriff 's department official said wednesday			1
authorities had earlier said the woman shot and killed her husband before taking her own life			1
but assistant sheriff @entity15 told reporters wednesday that a review of forensic evidence at the scene and autopsy results showed that police fatally wounded the gunman			1
" we made a determination that she did not shoot him			2
he did suffer a gunshot wound , and we believe the entrance wound was here , " @entity15 said , pointing to his own collarbone			1
in fact , he said , the fatal wound was delivered from a rifle fired by police			1
@entity15 said three officers fired on the suspect			1
" we do not believe any of her shots hit him , " he said			2
@entity15 said investigators were reviewing a " tremendous " amount of graphic video of the suspects during the rampage			2
" the video shows you exactly how vicious and coldblooded these murderers were , " he said			2
in the @entity49 security video , released by police , the @entity47 are seen in their final moments			1

the latest developments came as still - shaken colleagues of the fallen officers wore black bands to pay tribute to @entity71 , 31 , shot in the back of the head , and his partner , @entity75 , 41 , struck by a bullet in the neck			1
the killers apparently considered law enforcement as oppressors , authorities said			1
they placed a " @entity86 " flag and a @entity85 swastika on one officer and left a note saying , " this is the beginning of the revolution , " on the other officer 's body , authorities said			1
after gunning down the officers , @entity93 and @entity62 ran to a nearby @entity49 , police said , where they killed a bystander before barricading themselves inside the store during a firefight with responding officers			1
on wednesday , authorities revealed that police had previous contact with the couple on three occasions this year -- in february , april and on may 31 -- without incident			1
" there was no indication provided by the suspects of their anti-police feelings , " @entity15 said			2

@entity62 threatened to shoot staff at the agency after his suspended driver 's license was taken from him during a traffic stop , according to @entity121 , a spokeswoman for the @entity115			2
detectives who interviewed @entity62 did not perceive the " potential for an ongoing threat , " @entity15 said			2
a second contact came on april 10 when officers interviewed the @entity47 as witnesses in a domestic violence case , @entity15 said			1
the couple provided voluntary statements about the alleged assault and did not display any " anti-police " sentiments , he said			1
on may 31 , the @entity47 again provided statements to police officers about an alleged sexual assault of a neighbor without incident			1
" because an individual may online espouse ideology that is anti-government or anti-police does not make them translate into a murderer , " @entity15 said " what happened to change these two people into murderers , we do n't know			2
" authorities said three weapons were recovered from the suspects : a @entity148 9 mm handgun , a @entity150 .38 - caliber revolver and a @entity152 1300 12 gauge shotgun with a pistol grip			1
the weapons were not registered , as required by law			0
police officers have been kneeling in front of a makeshift memorial overflowing with flowers and miniature flags , and vowed to honor the slain officers and the uniform they deeply cherished			1

" it 's a complete different feeling when your two officers are basically assassinated because of the uniform they 're wearing			1
