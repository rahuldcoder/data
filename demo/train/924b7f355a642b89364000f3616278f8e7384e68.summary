-- neanderthals likely died off about 30,000 years ago , but they may have come up with a tool - making technique that influenced later humans in @entity4 , a new study suggests			1
scientists have uncovered evidence that @entity8 were making specialized bone tools before modern humans arrived in @entity4			1
" it opens the possibility that in this case , maybe they " -- modern humans in @entity4 -- " learned this tool type from @entity8 , " said @entity11 , co-author of the study and an archaeologist at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
this is only one possible scenario , however			0
another is that modern humans arrived earlier than scientists thought , and influenced @entity8 ' tool - making			1
or maybe the groups just came up with the same ideas independently			0
archaeologists will need to keep digging for more evidence			0
the new research is published in the journal @entity33			0
the artifacts , approximately 50,000 years old , come from two locations in @entity36			2
modern humans are thought to have arrived in @entity4 some 40,000 years ago			1
one of the sites is a classic @entity8 cave site called @entity40			2
there , researchers found part of the tip of a bone tool , just a few centimeters long			0
scientists believe it is part of a bone tool because of how rounded and polished the tip is			0
the other site is @entity51 , located about 35 kilometers away in a shallow valley up against a low cliff base , @entity11 said			0
at @entity55 , excavators found two more fragments like the one at @entity40 , and a complete tool specimen			0
@entity11 said both of these sites are known to be the stomping grounds of @entity8 because other fossils and tools characteristic of their species have been found there , and artifacts and bones from modern humans have not been uncovered there			1
at @entity40 , the skull of a @entity8 child was found			2
" here we have just @entity8 deposits , and so we can rule out any contamination from later time period deposits , " @entity11 said			2
scientists already knew that @entity8 could make bone tools , but previous specimens looked just like their stone tools			1
archaeologists had established that @entity8 would take bones and remove flakes to make scrapers , notch tools and hand axes , @entity11 said			1
these tools did n't make use of the inherently distinct properties of bone			0
" this paper adds further evidence that during their final 20,000 years , the @entity8 displayed aspects of behavioral complexity that we normally associate with modern humans , " said @entity89 at the @entity90 in @entity91 , who was not involved in the study , in an e-mail			1
the four newly discovered tool fragments appear very similar to a leather smoother called a lissoir , meaning " to make smooth			0
" neanderthals appear to have made them from the ribs of an animal the size of a red deer			0
feeling like a @entity8 ? here 's why a lissoir compacts a hide , makes the leather more water resistant and easier to work with , and gives it a shine , @entity11 said			0
this type of tool is commonly found at some of the oldest modern human sites in @entity4			1
high - end leather workers today still use such tools			0
to emphasize this point , @entity11 and colleagues bought one on the @entity125			0
researchers compared the wear and tear on one of their specimens to damage to a tool that the researchers produced themselves , used against a hide			0
they found similarities -- but they have n't proven that the @entity8 tools were for leather crafting			2
" a whole study has to be done to actually demonstrate that that 's what they were used for , " he said			0
the lissoir is a tool made of bone that can not be made of stone , @entity11 said			0
it " takes advantage of the flexibility and pliability and supple aspects of bone			0
" these are the oldest specialized bone tools -- meaning they were made in a way that focuses on the properties of bone -- in @entity4 , @entity11 said			1
they are not the oldest in the world			0
in @entity161 , modern humans were making similarly complicated bone tools around the same time			1
in @entity164 , sophisticated bone tools have been found as well , from about the same time			1
so , did @entity8 learn these tool - making technologies from humans who came from elsewhere ? if that 's the case , that means modern humans were in @entity4 earlier than previously believed , @entity11 said			1
he and his colleagues suspect that these tools predate the arrival of humans , which would suggest that @entity8 invented them independently			1
but he suspects there will be debate about whether the 50,000 - year - old tools are old enough to be certain that there were n't already modern humans in @entity4			1
there are still a lot of open questions : how widespread are these tools ? how did @entity8 make them , and how did modern humans make them ? what kind of animals were used ? @entity190 , researcher at the @entity191 , called this research " an important and interesting study " in an e-mail			1
but he noted that this does not suggest that @entity8 had the same cognitive capacities as modern humans			1
cave art and art objects are one of the hallmarks of modern humans during this time period , called the @entity202			2
there have not been any clear - cut discoveries of @entity8 making bone ornaments or other such objects , @entity190 said			2
" in my opinion , it is the capacity to produce objects whose function is non-utilitarian ( and most likely symbolic ) which marks a major leap in human evolution and this leap is not yet evidenced in the case of @entity8 and other premodern humans , " @entity190 said			2
so , @entity8 may not have been carving bone for art 's sake , but they may have independently invented something useful enough to be sold online today .			2

archaeologists uncover 50,000 - year - old specialized bone tools
the tools are discovered at @entity8 sites
modern humans are thought to have arrived in @entity4 at least 40,000 years ago
