@entity7 , @entity6 -- " first , please let me apologize to my family , friends , staff and fellow @entity4 for the cloud placed over @entity6			1
i did nothing wrong at the @entity11 airport			2
i regret my decision to plead guilty and the sadness that decision has brought to my wife , family , friends , staff , and fellow @entity4			1
" in june , i overreacted and made a poor decision			0
while i was not involved in any inappropriate conduct at the @entity11 airport or anywhere else , i chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in the hope of making it go away			2
i did not seek any counsel , either from an attorney , staff , friends , or family			1
that was a mistake , and i deeply regret it			0
because of that , i have now retained counsel and i am asking my counsel to review this matter and to advise me on how to proceed			1
" for a moment , i want to put my state of mind into context on june 11			2
for eight months leading up to june , my family and i had been relentlessly and viciously harassed by the @entity38			0
if you 've seen today 's paper , you know why			0
let me be clear : i am not gay and never have been			0
" still , without a shred of truth or evidence to the contrary , the @entity38 has engaged in this witch hunt			0
in pleading guilty , i overreacted in @entity11 , because of the stress of the @entity38 's investigation and the rumors it has fueled around @entity6			1
again , that overreaction was a mistake , and i apologize for my misjudgment			0
furthermore , i should not have kept this arrest to myself , and should have told my family and friends about it			1
i was n't eager to share this failure , but i should have done so anyway			0
" i love my wife , family , friends , staff and @entity6			1
i love serving @entity6 in @entity61			1
over the years , i have accomplished a lot for @entity6 , and i hope @entity4 will allow me to continue to do that			1
there are still goals i would like to accomplish , and i believe i can still be an effective leader for @entity6			2
next month , i will announce , as planned , whether or not i will seek re-election			0
" as an elected official , i fully realize that my life is open for public criticism and scrutiny , and i take full responsibility for the mistake in judgment i made in attempting to handle this matter myself			0
" it is clear , though , that through my actions i have brought a cloud over @entity6			2
for that , i ask the people of @entity6 for their forgiveness			2
" as i mentioned earlier , i have now retained counsel to examine this matter and i will make no further comment			1
" e-mail to a friend			0
