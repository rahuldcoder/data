@entity0 -- investigators were at work tuesday looking into the weekend theft of jewels worth close to $ 136 million from an exhibition in the @entity11 resort city of @entity0 , the prosecutor 's office in nearby @entity4 said			1
a reformed jewel thief told @entity1 that the robbery sunday morning at a jewelry exhibition in the luxury @entity15 -- the third gem theft around the city since may -- had all the hallmarks of a professional job			1
the robber , whose face was covered by a hat and a scarf , had a semiautomatic pistol and threatened to shoot the exhibitors and guests , according to @entity28 , deputy prosecutor for organized crime in the prosecutor 's office			2
security guards were present but unarmed , he said			0
" it was definitely a professional heist , i 've been saying that from day one , " said @entity35 , who himself served time for jewelry thefts but is now an author and motivational speaker			1

" it 's definitely not a lone man , it was too coordinated , " he said			0
" they went in and within five minutes they knew exactly where to go			0

@entity35 said he was surprised the jewels were not fitted with an electronic security device that would have given anyone carrying them beyond a certain distance an electric shock			1
but he urged against blaming the security guards for the theft			0
the gems may well already be in the hands of unscrupulous buyers , who probably paid about a fifth of what they 're worth , he said			2
the @entity72 union , representing workers at the hotel , criticized the management of the @entity76 for what it called " irresponsibility			1
" despite the growing number of events showcasing luxury goods , and the resulting insecurity , " the @entity76 management has favored financial operations over the safety of personnel , " a @entity72 statement said			2
the union called on the @entity11 government to initiate an investigation into the safety of jewelry exhibitions in hotels			2
the @entity94 prosecutor 's office told @entity1 on monday that the value of the stolen jewels was close to $ 136 million , more than twice what had previously been stated			1
the jewels were supposed to have been on display until the end of august but signs advertising the @entity103 exhibition have now been taken down from the hotel			1
a spokesman for @entity106 in @entity107 said tuesday that the company had " no further information or statement " to give on the incident			0
the @entity103 jewelry firm has flagship boutiques in @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			1
it boasts of being one of the largest diamond manufacturers in the world , allowing it to offer " the industry 's most extraordinary assortment of large , rare and colored diamonds			0
" the robbery follows two major jewel heists this year during the @entity128 in may			2
