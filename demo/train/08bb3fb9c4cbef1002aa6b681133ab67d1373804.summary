-- it was supposed to be a couple 's little getaway , on a little plane , from @entity5 to the @entity7 coast			1
it turned into a tragedy			0
the saga of the single - engine @entity11 also turned into an international incident , spurring both the @entity14 and @entity15 to dispatch fighter jets to trail the plane after it went radio silent			1
so what happened ? why might a plane 's crew go unresponsive for over four hours , drifting southward over the @entity14 mainland , the @entity23 and eventually into the @entity24 as it did ? the @entity26 , or @entity26 , tweeted it might have been a case of hypoxia , a condition that sets in when a person does n't get enough oxygen -- as can happen if there 's an airflow problem high in the sky			1
what is hypoxia ? the best clues , so far , lie in what @entity14 fighter jet pilots saw as they looked into the aircraft : the pilot slumped over and the windows frosted over			1
then there was the radio communication , which the @entity46 says ended around 10 a.m. et. at that time , the plane was somewhere above @entity48 , @entity49 , about 600 miles south of the @entity51 , @entity5 , airport it left from around 8:45 a.m. destined for @entity53 , @entity7			2
the pilot asks to descend to 18,000 feet because " we have an indication that is not correct in the plane , " according to a stream of that transmission posted on @entity60			1
the air traffic controller told the pilot to " stand by , " then to proceed to 25,000 feet as he works on clearing the plane to go lower			1
the conversation continues off - and - on for over four minutes , though it 's largely one - sided : the pilot is n't clear in his remarks , nor does he ever declare any sort of emergency			1
at one point , he simply repeats his call sign twice when the controller asks if he heard the request to drop down to 20,000 feet			0
data indicates the plane did n't drop			2
it cruised for hours some 25,000 - feet above the ground			0
until sometime before 2:15 p.m. , that is , by which point estimates suggested the fuel would have run out			0
the aircraft , by then , had slowed considerably -- down to 176 knots ( 200 mph ) , from a consistent 308 knots for most of its flight			2
and it stopped altogether after crashing 14 miles off @entity88 's northeast coast			1
@entity91 , @entity90 ' children ' devastated ' the watery crash spurred @entity88 and the @entity14 to swiftly dispatch government aircraft to the scene			1
by early evening , @entity88 authorities had found an oil slick in the prime search area that -- at that point -- was the only possible sign of the downed aircraft , according to maj. @entity101 of the @entity102			1
this differs from earlier reports that a " wreckage field " had been spotted			0
" ( the search ) is fairly unpredictable given the size of the area and given the conditions out there , " said @entity101 , who said the operation would stop at nightfall before resuming saturday morning with assistance from a @entity109 cutter			0
" it 's very difficult to say what we will be able to recover and when			0
" as they searched , the @entity119 family of @entity51 , @entity5 , mourned			0
the @entity109 issued a statement indicating there were " three people reportedly aboard " the plane			2
yet @entity125 , the family spokesman and also the @entity90 ' nephew , said he believed the couple were the only people on the plane , with @entity119 flying the couple toward their vacation home in @entity7			2
while there was no official announcement immediately on the fate of those on the plane , the @entity90 ' children said in a statement they were " devastated by the tragic and sudden loss of our parents			2
" politicians in @entity5 hailed the couple for their business and charitable endeavors , with gov. @entity144 calling them " innovative and generous people who were committed to revitalizing downtown @entity51 and making the city they loved a better place for all			0
" @entity119 co-founded @entity150 in 1970 , a year after graduating from @entity151			0
according to his official bio , the company owns and manages more than 50 properties totaling over 9 million square feet in the @entity51 area			0
@entity156 founded @entity157 , a 100 - employee company that has an outlet store and makes " two national retail catalogs mailed to 35 million people annually , " according to its website			0
a post on @entity163 , which is produced in conjunction with the @entity166 's business school , notes that she ran the @entity167 , did whitewater rafting and learned how to fly a plane -- all in addition to raising three children and building her business			2
the @entity90 ' children acknowledged late friday afternoon that they " too are waiting for answers			0
" as they do , they took the chance to remember their parents and to express appreciation to those who were quick to offer condolences			0
" they loved and appreciated the opportunity to help build the community of @entity51 , and we thank everyone in the community for their expressions of support , " the children said			0
@entity14 , @entity15 fighter jets trail aircraft while authorities do n't know everything that went on inside the plane , including what caused it to crash , they have spoken about what they did in response			1
the government response started with those air traffic control communications -- and the alarming lack thereof			1
the unresponsiveness spurred @entity26 to dispatch two @entity204 fighter jets set from @entity205 in @entity206 , @entity207 , to investigate			0
@entity26 said another pair of fighter jets out of @entity210 , @entity7 -- f - 15s -- took over around 11:30 a.m. and escorted the plane as it continued south past the @entity14 mainland			1
the @entity14 fighter jets broke off their pursuit 12 miles off @entity15 , at which point the @entity217 plane was still cruising at about 25,000 feet			1
a @entity15 fighter jet took over trailing the aircraft as it flew near that @entity24 island , according to @entity26			1
their longstanding public enmity notwithstanding , @entity15 was cooperating fully with the @entity14 on the matter and did not consider the plane 's movement a violation of its airspace , according to a @entity15 source involved in conversations between the two nations			1
the @entity15 government even let the @entity109 's c - 130 aircraft go through its airspace and also gave permission for @entity14 " military aircraft , if necessary , " according to an official statement			1
but none of these efforts , from either of these countries , could do anything about the doomed @entity217 aircraft before it dropped off radar -- according to the flight tracking site , @entity244 -- at 2:11 p.m. both @entity90 knew how to fly , although @entity245 said @entity156 's ability to fly legally may have lapsed			2
the plane itself was owned by @entity119 's company , @entity150			0
it was built by the @entity252 manufacturer @entity251 and powered by one @entity254 engine			0
1999 : @entity256 's plane lost pressure before crash 2012 : small plane with unresponsive pilot crashes into @entity261 @entity0 's @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report .			2

new : @entity15 : @entity14 -- including " military aircraft , if necessary " -- had ok to use its airspace
pilot told air traffic control something was " not correct , " but did n't declare an emergency
@entity14 and @entity15 aircraft tried to track the small aircraft , but neither could alter its course
the plane crashed about 14 miles off the coast of @entity88 , authorities say
