it 's official , @entity0 is @entity2			1
in the words of @entity9 , " in people 's hearts and minds , @entity0 has always been an inseparable part of @entity7			1
" indeed @entity7 said that in sunday 's referendum 97 % of its participants , mostly ethnic @entity2 , insisted that to belong to the @entity7 versus @entity12 ( @entity12 , another name for @entity14 ) had been their dream for 60 years since the @entity17 leader @entity16 , my great - grandfather , transferred the peninsula 's jurisdiction to @entity21			1
in his address to @entity23 on march 18 announcing the annexation , @entity9 said that by this @entity16 action @entity7 was not " simply robbed , it was plundered			1
" there are many reasons for transfer that @entity9 could have outlined : administrative , economic , desire to overcome @entity31 's legacy of central control			1
yet he chose to say my great - grandfather was atoning for " the mass repressions of the 1930s in @entity14			1
" well , @entity16 became the first secretary of the @entity37 in 1938 , when most of the repressions -- namely @entity40 , the @entity41 , brought in part by @entity31 's heavy industrialization -- were over			1
it is rich of the @entity2 president to accuse @entity16 of repressions			2
what about @entity31 , the true tyrant ? @entity9 is not @entity31 , of course , not yet , but he sees himself walking in the dictator 's shoes : he adds lands to the great @entity7 , while other sorry leaders like @entity16 only squandered it away			1
not that @entity16 , a @entity17 autocrat , shied away from brutality , indeed participating in repressions and purges -- that was the style of the times			2
nonetheless , after @entity31 's death in 1953 his goal was to decentralize the @entity61 monolith , hence the @entity0 transfer			1
no stranger to propaganda -- @entity65 excelled in arguing @entity17 superiority over ethnic national pride , @entity14 or any other , as well as over decadent and dying capitalism -- @entity16 still would have cringed at @entity9 's distortions			1
" @entity21 is the mother of @entity2 cities			0
@entity77 is our common source and we can not live without each other , " the president said , implying that given this closeness @entity7 must have control over the @entity76 territory			0
@entity16 too thought that @entity14 and @entity7 were almost one -- after all a symbolic reason for the 1954 transfer was the 300th anniversary of the @entity14 - @entity2 unification			1
but he would think of them as equal nations , assigning the original primacy to the 9th century @entity21 , not to @entity89 , which until the 1100s was just an obscure place in the woods			0
@entity16 , who valued diversity ( as much as the @entity17 despot could ) would have condemned the @entity95 -- development of the military industrial complex based on the @entity99 - centric heavy industry and export of raw materials			2
in @entity17 times that complex was a staple of the economy , as the main slogan of the @entity99 was the class struggle against global imperialism			0
and even if my great - grandfather used that argument in @entity112 , sending tanks to suppress the @entity114 , a popular uprising against hardline communism , he lamented similar tactics in 1968 when his successor @entity117 squashed the @entity118			1
under @entity117 this kind of incursions into neighboring territories became known as the @entity122			0
it declared that forces hostile to socialism should not be tolerated , and to cement this argument in 1979 the @entity127 send troops to @entity129 to provide security to its recently formed @entity131			0
@entity16 died in 1971 and did n't see what harm the @entity129 war did to his country -- thousands of lives lost and the economy strained by the time it withdrew with defeat exactly a quarter of a century ago -- but he , who in retirement spoke candidly of his and @entity65 's mistakes , would have been horrified by the stanchness of the @entity99 's patterns			2
today @entity9 would undoubtedly suggest that @entity0 is not different from @entity129			1
speaking to the veterans about the @entity129 invasion in february 2004 , he explained there were legitimate geopolitical reasons to protect the @entity17 @entity149 border			0
now citing security of nations within @entity89 's sphere of influence he has justified the @entity14 territorial takeover			2
what 's more , in the @entity117 era the expansionist policies of the military industrial complex were a result of the oil prosperity			0
after the 1973 oil crisis its prices reached 41 dollars a barrel by 1981			0
they provided some material comforts to the @entity17 , fueled their belief in the @entity127 's stability and strength			0
similarly , with oil at around $ 100 a barrel in recent decades , the gdp growth under @entity9 -- up 8 % until just a few years ago -- allowed @entity2 to live well like never before , also cultivating a sense of superiority			0
the success of the @entity176 last month has only made it greater			0
in fact the @entity179 ' desire to join @entity7 is partially based on their trust that @entity9 will turn them into another @entity183 , with posh hotels and pristine beaches			1
but the cost of upgrading or rebuilding the peninsula 's economic and social infrastructure will range from $ 10 billion ( 300 billion rubles ) to $ 85 billion ( 3 trillion rubles )			0
can @entity7 really foot that bill ? a bitter lesson from the @entity127 is that the state , driven by an undiversified and oil - based economy , runs out of funds to support its extra territories because nationalistic emotions take over economic calculations			2
@entity2 inflexible financial system was suffering even before the @entity14 crisis began			0
last year 's forecasts suggest that in the next 15 years @entity7 's growth rate would fall from 4.3 % to 2.5 % if it keeps its raw material focus			2
now with the @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 hitting the @entity99 with sanctions -- account freezes and visa bans for the high level @entity9 government officials -- further economic downturn is inevitable			1
the @entity122 -- defense of socialism through expansion and the military industrial complex -- had led to the inglorious @entity17 collapse			0
the doomsday of the @entity95 must be approaching fast .			0

@entity9 says when @entity16 handed @entity0 to @entity14 , @entity7 was not " simply robbed , it was plundered "
@entity221 says it 's *unfair* to blame her great - grandfather for the act - @entity31 was the real *villain* , she says
further economic downturn is now inevitable , she says *due* to the economic sanctions *imposed* by the @entity228
