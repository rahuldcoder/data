in 1974 , @entity0 started the @entity1			1
in 1976 , the foundation was renamed @entity3 , with @entity0 as one of the co-founders			1
his vision was to build a nonpartisan organization that would advance ideas that enable all people to prosper by promoting liberty , limited government , free markets and peace			0
that vision has remained a constant since the beginning			0
i currently serve on the board of @entity3 , and have worked with libertarian organizations for more than 20 years , including @entity20 and the @entity21			1
i have worked closely with @entity0 and his brother @entity22 on numerous libertarian endeavors			2
in each instance , these two men have consistently championed libertarian principles , even in the face of unfair and inaccurate criticism			1
@entity29 , @entity3 's current chairman , would have you believe otherwise			1
according to his april 2 op - ed , @entity0 and @entity32 seek to turn @entity3 into a " policy shop for the @entity35 ' political operations			1
" this is patently false			0
@entity22 , who has been a director of @entity3 since 1987 and serves on its executive committee , and @entity0 have consistently supported a nonpartisan @entity3			1
in 1980 , @entity0 brought a resolution before the @entity3 board confirming that @entity3 should be nonpartisan			1
together , they have contributed approximately $ 40 million to the institute			1
@entity3 's independence has never been in question in the 37 years the @entity35 have been involved with the organization , and there is nothing real to suggest it will be an issue going forward			2
in bringing up previous conversations that he had with @entity32 , @entity29 is distorting the record in order to support his position			2
i attended the november 2011 meeting where @entity29 spoke with @entity22			2
subsequent conversations with @entity29 confirmed that the @entity35 have never proposed that @entity3 cooperate with only one group , or work exclusively with @entity0 - affiliated groups or groups affiliated with one political party			1
@entity22 reiterated this point publicly in a statement on march 22			0
@entity29 wrote that the @entity35 seek to " get ( their ) way " or " take control " of @entity3			1
@entity65 , who is the president of @entity3 , wants to maintain control of the institute by circumventing @entity3 's shareholders ' agreement			2
all that the @entity35 seek is for the parties to @entity3 's shareholders ' agreement ( which has been in place since 1985 ) to be bound by that agreement			2
@entity65 and @entity29 do not want this because , with the recent death of one of @entity3 's shareholders , they are concerned that they will lose control of @entity3			1
we should ask why self - professed libertarians would seek to abrogate voluntary agreements -- a key tenet of libertarian thought			0
@entity65 and @entity29 have talked about seeking a board of independent directors , but every action by them suggests they want the opposite -- a board that is responsive to and dependent upon them , as well as donors they view as acceptable			0
when i was unanimously elected to the @entity3 board in 2010 , i was excited about the prospect of working with an organization of @entity3 's reputation			2
i had also previously been offered a job by @entity102 in 2002			0
i expected an organization where people would be free to engage in constructive debates -- where differing points of view would be acknowledged and respected			0
what i found was something very different			0
what is most upsetting is that all of this public battle could have been avoided			0
@entity0 and @entity32 were willing to keep the 2011 @entity3 board in place without making any changes , but @entity65 and @entity29 demanded an immediate vote on directors			1
the @entity35 have also proposed third - party mediation , but @entity65 and @entity29 refused that as well , calling mediation a delay tactic			0
it is @entity65 and @entity29 's concern about their control of @entity3 , rather than concern for the good of the organization , that is driving the dispute			1
@entity3 is losing its voice and focus , at a time when the debate over the role of the government in our society is more needed than ever			0
if @entity3 's board members truly care about the institute 's future , they should demand that @entity65 and @entity29 stop this scorched - earth public relations fight , which is weakening the organization and harming its reputation , and force immediate negotiations			1
just last week , @entity0 again proposed that the parties choose a third - party mediator in hopes of reaching an agreement			0
@entity3 's management continues to refuse it			0
they show no desire to end this state of affairs short of capitulation to @entity65 and @entity29 's demands			0
if @entity3 is truly to become independent , then it needs to become independent from all of its shareholders -- first and foremost , @entity65 .			0

@entity160 : @entity0 has consistently championed libertarian ideas
@entity163 : @entity3 chairman @entity29 would have you believe otherwise
he says the @entity0 brothers support independence for @entity3 and have given it $ 40 million
@entity163 : if @entity29 does *n't* stop dispute , @entity3 will weaken and lose its reputation
