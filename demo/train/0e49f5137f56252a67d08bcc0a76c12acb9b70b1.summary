@entity0 -- the @entity3 request for the @entity4 to continue flying its planes capable of striking at @entity7 troops on the ground has raised concern that coalition forces do not have the military equipment needed for the type of strikes necessary to continue degrading @entity7 's military			1
the @entity4 was expected to stop flying its a- 10s and ac - 130s this weekend as @entity3 took over leadership of the entire mission			1
the planes are equipped to fly lower and slower than fighter jets , which improves accuracy in targeting of troops and tanks that are in and around cities			0
days of bad weather in @entity7 hampered visibility and the ability of coalition planes to strike at advancing @entity7 troops with as little risk to civilians as possible , and @entity3 asked the @entity4 extend flying the specialized planes through monday , according to @entity33 , a @entity3 spokeswoman			1
learn more about the ' unique resources ' provided by the @entity4 but a @entity3 official said that , weather aside , only the @entity4 has the ability from the air to strike at mobile troops and equipment			1
@entity3 needed that from the @entity4 , the @entity3 official said			1
" specifically the @entity41 and the ac - 130s nobody else but the @entity4 has , " the official noted			2
the transition from @entity4 command to @entity3 command , and the subsequent halt to flights of @entity4 fighter jets over @entity7 , was not supposed to lessen the coalition capabilities , @entity4 officials had said			2
when @entity3 first announced the agreement to take over the mission , a senior administration official briefing reporters at the @entity54 insisted that the transition would not hamper the operation			2
" it means , in practice , that @entity3 will conduct the military operation in a way that is very similar to the way the coalition has conducted it up to this point , and no more but also no less , " the senior administration official said			0
@entity70 , most notably @entity65 senators @entity66 of @entity67 and @entity68 of @entity69 , warned last week that the @entity4 decision to stop flying planes like the @entity73 and @entity74 while the @entity7 military is still fighting hard was a big mistake			0
" the fact is that your timing is exquisite , " @entity66 said at a hearing last week where the secretary of defense and chairman of the @entity80 were testifying about @entity7			0
" at a time when the @entity88 forces have literally tragically routed the @entity90 forces , that 's when we announced that the @entity4 is abdicating its leadership role and removing some of the most valuable assets that could be used to great effect against those rebels			0
" the @entity80 chairman , adm. @entity96 , insisted that taking the planes out would not lessen the coalition capabilities			0
the coalition efforts " could be sustained at the necessary levels to support the opposition , " he said			0
defense secretary @entity103 and @entity96 said while the @entity4 was pulling the planes from daily use , they would be on standby in case @entity3 needed them			1
the @entity3 official said it is " possible " they could keep returning to the battlefield when there is bad weather and @entity3 calls for them , if @entity103 approves the use			1
the @entity4 is also supplying what officials refer to as " unique capabilities , " like surveillance drones , electronic jamming equipment and refueling planes .			0

@entity3 has asked the @entity4 to continue *airstrikes* through monday
a @entity3 official says the alliance lacks the planes needed to make *precision* strikes
it is possible the @entity4 planes could continue to fly missions , the official says
