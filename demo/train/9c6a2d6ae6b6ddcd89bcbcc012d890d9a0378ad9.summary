@entity1 officials exploded in outrage after @entity3 agreed to plea guilty to criminal charges , pay nearly $ 9 billion in fines , and have access to dollar clearing suspended for a year for its persistent violations of @entity9 economic sanctions against @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
the international bank fell under @entity9 jurisdiction by virtue of facilitating transactions in dollars which passed through the @entity9			1
most financial commentators had little sympathy with the @entity1 position , since the giant bank 's conduct was egregious			1
it included ongoing records - doctoring to hide the true identity of customers and stymieing the @entity9 investigation			1
but the @entity1 argument was essentially political : that the @entity9 had no right to impose its will on a foreign bank , and these transactions were legal under @entity33 law			1
yet this is far from the first time the @entity9 has used its position as issuer of the world 's reserve currency to advance its foreign policy agenda			1
for instance , in the @entity45 in 1956 , @entity42 's need for dollar credit to defend the pound enabled the @entity9 to force @entity42 and @entity1 to pull back from military confrontation			1
the economic reality is that the @entity9 derives considerable power from its role as the issuer of the world 's reserve currency and its control over dollar - based payment systems			1
large banks run huge volumes of transactions with each other during the day			2
they are willing to do so because these systems are ultimately backstopped by the @entity61			0
while parties unhappy with @entity9 's use , and some would contend abuse , of @entity9 dollar dominance , financial institutions could set up dollar transaction mechanisms that completely skirted the @entity9			2
but with low volumes and no @entity61 protection , they 'd be vastly higher cost			0
the other alternative is to try to encourage more use of non-dollar currencies , like the euro and @entity77 's renminbi			0
but the euro has no benchmark bond , plus continued concerns about political fracture and sovereign bond restructurings mean it 's not a contender to replace the greenback any time soon			0
and even though @entity77 has been aggressively promoting trade denominated in the renminbi , the volume is puny , a mere 1.5 % of the global total			0
but putting aside the international row , what does the @entity3 settlement say about addressing misconduct at too big to fail banks ? perversely , while banks are wards of the state and get more support and subsidies than any other type of business ( for instance , @entity95 and quantitative easing are massive transfers from savers to financial players ) , the authorities have lacked the will to discipline them effectively			1
even though the @entity3 fine exceeded a year of earnings , the bank 's stock rose 3.6 % when the deal was announced , saying that investors though @entity3 had done well			1
the conundrum is indicting a bank at the parent level is widely perceived to be a potential death blow , since many counterparties would have to stop doing business with it immediately			0
removing the @entity9 banking licenses of a serial fraudster , another possible remedy , would similarly put a @entity9 firm out of business and would inflict severe , permanent damage on a big foreign bank			2
hence the tendency of officials to rely on big , or at least big - sounding , fines			2
but it is bankers , not banks , that commit crimes			0
here , the @entity3 deal falls short			2
true , 13 officers were forced to resign , including one of its chief operating officers			0
but he was on the verge of retirement , and more important , no one was charged criminally or fined			0
by contrast , in 1991 , when @entity149 failed to curb a trader that was repeatedly gaming government bond auctions , @entity146 's ceo , vice chairman , and president departed abruptly			0
we 've seen nothing like that punishment meted out to top executives in the post-crisis wave of investigations			1
and until that happens , banks will continue to behave as if they have the upper hand			0

@entity3 has been fined nearly $ 9 billion in fines for violations of @entity9 sanctions
@entity1 authorities *criticized* the fine as *excessive* and *disproportionate*
author @entity174 says fines such as this have only limited impact on the banks
banks will not change until top executives face punishment , @entity174 writes
