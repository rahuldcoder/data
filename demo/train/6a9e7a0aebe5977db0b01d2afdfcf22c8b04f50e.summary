-- " @entity2 " is back in action			1
the top - rated comedy returns to @entity4 on monday with its eighth season premiere after contract talks briefly held up production in late july			1
' @entity2 ' contract talks stall production but since the contracts have been hammered out -- with some of the leading cast members now earning a reported $ 1 million per episode -- " @entity2 " is moving forward with what sounds like a season full of changes			1
let 's hope @entity16 can cope this time around			2
here 's what we 've heard fans should expect for season 8 of " @entity2 " : @entity16 's return at the end of season 7 , @entity23 ( @entity24 ) announced that he could n't handle all of the new developments happening in his life , and was " getting on a train and leaving forever			1
" his plan to " live off the land " did n't go so well , as he makes his return in season 8 's hour - long premiere after getting robbed on the train			1
as a sneak peek shows , @entity36 ( @entity35 ) and @entity37 ( @entity38 ) have to head down to @entity40 to collect @entity16 and bring him back home			1
do n't expect a wedding for @entity36 and @entity43 @entity43 ( @entity44 ) and @entity36 may have ended the seventh season with an engagement , but executive producer @entity47 told tv guide they 're not rushing the couple to the altar			1
they 're going to take it so slowly that @entity47 is " 99 % " sure that a wedding wo n't happen in season 8			1
" we 're not anti-wedding			2
it 's just they 're feeling this out , " the @entity56 said			2
" stuff with money and things like that can come up with them being engaged without us having to rush to the altar and change the fabric of the show			2
" besides , @entity47 added , he 's just not ready to see @entity36 and @entity16 cease being roommates			2
@entity16 and @entity43 get new jobs not to mention that @entity43 has a big career shift in front of her : the waitress / actress is leaving the drama behind for a new job as a pharmaceutical sales rep at @entity78 's ( @entity77 ) company			1
you 'll see her interview with her new , much shorter haircut during tonight 's two - part premiere			1
the new gig has the potential to rock the boat in @entity43 's new engagement			0
" it alters their dynamic because now she 's actually doing well financially , " @entity47 told @entity87			0
" it 's a new chapter for her			0
" along with @entity43 , @entity16 's also carving a new path at work			0
he 'll get to study dark matter as long as he takes a job as a junior professor			0
yet it looks like no one 's interested in taking @entity16 's course -- except for @entity103 , that is			0
@entity103 has mother issues perhaps @entity103 ( @entity105 ) just really needs the distraction , since he 's butting heads with his mother 's caretaker , @entity108			0
" he 's playing too many roles for my character to feel comfortable with , " @entity105 , who plays @entity103 , says of the new season			2
" it 's a bit of a threat to @entity103 that he 's being replaced as a son			0
" @entity16 and @entity37 are taking it slow @entity37 was not pleased that @entity36 and @entity43 let @entity16 go off on his soul - searching journey , and the couple 's reunion is n't exactly romantic			0
it 's @entity36 that @entity16 calls when he gets into trouble , and when @entity37 shows up with @entity36 at the police station , a surprised @entity16 asks , " why did you come ? " but the couple 's come too far for @entity16 's social fumbles to get in their way			0
" we 're always moving them forward in baby steps , " producer @entity47 told @entity87			0
" " they 're on the same trajectory that they 've been on since they met , and that is she is continuing to drag him along into this relationship , whether he wants to admit that he likes it or or not			0
he 's come a long way			0
" @entity142 and @entity143 are going strong season 7 ended with each main character finding love , and that included @entity143 ( @entity148 ) , who 's now dating @entity149 's @entity142			2
the couple is still together as season 8 begins , and @entity47 promises that we 'll learn more about @entity142 as the season progresses			1
