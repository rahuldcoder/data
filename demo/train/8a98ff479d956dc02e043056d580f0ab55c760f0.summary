-- your @entity1 wo n't be any slower than usual on wednesday , but it might look like it is			1
top sites on the @entity1 , including @entity4 and @entity5 , will be displaying a constant " loading " symbol -- the so - called " loading pinwheel " or , alternately , the @entity8			1
it 's part of a protest called " @entity11 , " a push against the @entity15 government 's support for so - called internet fast lanes			1
the @entity17 in may proposed allowing broadband providers to charge companies like @entity20 and @entity4 for prioritized access to consumers			0
the proposal is now open for public comment and could be changed before a final vote to implement it			2
as part of the @entity11 protest , the websites will also include a prompt to contact your lawmakers about the @entity17 proposal			1
" it 's always hard to explain complicated topics to a lot of people , and the @entity17 made it harder by trying to fool the public into thinking their proposal was real net neutrality , when it was actually what the cable and phone lobbyists always asked for , " said organizer @entity31 , executive director of civil liberties group @entity32 and a former @entity35 state representative			0
net neutrality refers to the principle that high - speed internet providers should treat all types of web content equally , which led to a set of rules the @entity17 approved in 2010 , designed to keep the companies that hold the keys to the web from playing favorites			0
' pay to play ' on the @entity55 ? net neutrality explained sites including @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 plan to take part in this week 's demonstration , which will last from midnight wednesday to midnight thursday			1
broadband internet providers , many of them cable companies , argue that as businesses providing a service , they have a right to charge websites			2
@entity4 accounts for around a third of data consumption online during peak hours , and internet providers say the company should therefore help foot the bill for delivery			0
but those fees would be easier to absorb for the @entity55 's biggest , and richest , sites , activists say			1
smaller , less profitable sites would have a tough time competing			2
@entity31 said altering the @entity17 plan is an uphill battle , but he 's optimistic			0
" we can never ever underestimate the power of cable and phone companies in @entity89 , but we definitely have a shot of winning , " he said			0
" we have the momentum and are building impressive support in the public , industry , and policymakers			0

websites will *participate* in @entity11 on wednesday
demonstration is meant to urge government to keep @entity55 open and free
@entity5 , @entity58 and @entity59 among those *participating*
