-- @entity1 went out to buy some @entity2 -- and was shot dead before he made it home			1
the case is horrifying , maddening , grotesque			1
and -- perhaps worst of all -- there may be nothing @entity8 law enforcement can do about it			2
as the world now knows , the 17 - year - old @entity1 walked to a store in @entity11 to buy some snacks on the night of february 26			1
@entity13 , a volunteer @entity13 captain , thought the boy looked suspicious and called 911			0
the 911 operator told @entity13 to keep his distance -- police would be sent -- but there was a confrontation between @entity13 and @entity1			1
@entity1 was killed with a single shot to the chest			1
@entity8 authorities have not arrested @entity13 , and federal authorities recently joined the investigation			0
the legal question at the heart of the case involves @entity8 's so - called " stand your ground " law , which the legislature passed , at the behest of the @entity32 , in 2005			1
before that time , @entity8 law resembled that of most other states ; during confrontations , individuals had a duty to retreat rather than to respond to provocations			2
under the new law , a person is allowed to use deadly force if he is in a place he has a right to be and feels reasonably threatened with serious harm			1
weigh in on the @entity1 case , share your thoughts on @entity48 in this case , then , the question is whether @entity13 was in such a place and felt reasonably threatened			1
the 911 operator told @entity13 to keep his distance from @entity1 , but @entity13 had a right to be on the street			1
that 's where neighborhood watch volunteers work			2
clearly , the question at the heart of the case is whether @entity13 reasonably felt threatened			1
on this issue , the evidence currently seems murky			0
there appears to have been some sort of confrontation between @entity13 and @entity1			1
police found @entity13 with an injury to his head			0
most important -- and most tragic -- the police will hear only one side of the story about this confrontation			0
@entity1 is not around to tell his story			1
the continuing investigation will surely focus on finding other witnesses			0
the facts of this case show why the " stand your ground " law is so important			2
the law focuses on the subjective understanding of the shooter			2
was his understanding of the situation " reasonable " ? ultimately , that would be a question for the jury to decide , but it still gives a lot of deference to the perpetrator of a violent act			0
the new law even allows a disproportionate response ; if someone comes at you with a fist , you can reply with a gun			0
in light of the shift in the law , it 's not surprising that since the law went into effect , reports of justifiable homicides have tripled , according to the @entity109			2
another case under litigation in @entity8 highlights the effect of the law			2
in september 2010 , @entity114 was playing basketball with his 8 - year - old daughter on an outdoor court in @entity118			0
a boy was skateboarding on the court at the same time , and @entity121 , a man who lived in the area , told the boy he should n't be skateboarding there			0
@entity114 stood up for the boy , and he and @entity121 had a confrontation			0
@entity121 was carrying a gun and wound up shooting @entity114 dead			0
@entity121 asserted that he felt threatened by @entity114 , and has asked that the case be dismissed before trial under the " stand your ground " law			1
( the judge will soon make a ruling			0
) in both of these cases -- in the deaths of both @entity114 and @entity1 -- the legal defense for the shooters appears to rely almost completely on the " stand your ground " law			1
in the death of @entity114 , prosecutors are doing their best against tough odds			0
in the death of @entity1 , it 's prosecutors who are taking the heat for failing , thus far , to bring any charges against @entity13			1
but this outrage , understandable though it is , might be directed somewhere else as well			0
the @entity8 legislators who voted for the " stand your ground " law -- and gov. @entity155 , who signed it -- have something to answer for as well			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			2

@entity160 : @entity1 , 17 , was shot dead out buying candy in horrifying case
" @entity166 " law allows killing if shooter feels " reasonably " threatened , he says
@entity160 : law means alleged shooter 's killing is justified by his own *perception* of threat
@entity1 no *longer* here to give his side , @entity160 says
