" @entity0 killed the minibar			2
" the sentiments of one hotel manager in @entity4 could well extend to hotels around the world			1
the hotel minibar , loved and cursed at by millions of desperate midnight snackers / drinkers , is on the decline			1
@entity11 @entity4 installed the world 's first hotel minibar in 1974 by stocking liquors and fridges in each of its 840 rooms			1
the move reportedly led to a 500 % increase in room - service drink sales and a 5 % boost to the company 's net income that year			1
soon , the minibar became a near - universal industry standard			2
but @entity11 recently started backtracking in some of its properties , removing the booze and leaving the fridges in its rooms , for guests to fill themselves			1
other hotel giants , including the @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity37 brands , are also phasing out this once ubiquitous in - room feature from some of their properties			1
it 's because we just do n't seem to enjoy them as much as we once did			0
@entity44 recently released a survey that found the minibar ranked least popular among all hotel amenities -- just 21 % of respondents found the room fridge an important feature compared with 89 % that wanted a free wireless connection			1
@entity53 found that in the @entity57 , revenue from minibars , which represents just 1 % of total hotel revenue , fell 28 % from 2007 to 2012			1
@entity58 , the firm 's director of research information services , says properties in the @entity57 have adapted their food and beverage offerings , installing food outlets that resemble " grab and go " mini-markets			1
the trend for " convenience eating " is also contributing to a decline in the traditional hotel restaurant that serves three meals a day , he says			1
they 're being replaced with casual food outlets offering items such as pre-packaged salads			0
it 's all part of what @entity58 calls the " @entity81 phenomenon , " a property design and management philosophy that enables and encourages interaction between strangers			0
combine this with the emergence of sociable " millennials " who prefer to mingle in the hotel lobby than order room service , and you have an industry and consumer move away from imbibing in the room			1
is this such a bad thing ? for those who think inflated prices on items like tiny bags of macadamia nuts and mediocre chocolate bars are offensive , especially when nearby convenience stores offer the same stuff for a fraction of the price , the stocked in - room bar has always been an irritant			1
@entity106 , vice president of operations of @entity108 - based @entity107 , agrees			0
" we do n't want to sell mini-macadamia nuts for $ 8.50			0
it 's not what people want , " he says			0
what 's more , by eliminating minibars from rooms , hotels can actually save costs , says @entity120			1
" when ( we ) remove any content from the minibar it takes a considerable number of tasks out of every ( housekeeper 's ) day , so there 's time saved , headcount saved , therefore money saved , which is reflected in the overall price ( of rooms ) , " he says			1
better for a property to focus on amenities guests prioritize , such as internet access			2
" connectivity is as ubiquitous as the telephone 20 years ago , when it had to be in the room , or like your own shower or bathroom has to be in the room			2
" $ 10 @entity144 ' not right ' others think the minibar simply needs to evolve to changing needs of guests			2
" we ca n't just give hot and cold running water , " says @entity149 , area director of operations of @entity150 at @entity151			0
take the example of @entity151 's @entity4 property , @entity155 -- each room features a complimentary selection ( beer , soda , healthy juices , coconut water and snacks ) and a separate , chargeable wine fridge			0
" we wanted to differentiate ourselves to appeal to discerning business and leisure travelers without following the traditional routes of five - star hospitality , " explains @entity149			0
he thinks " charging $ 5 - 10 for @entity144 is not the right thing to do , " as people remain price conscious			0
" people appreciate a complimentary minibar or @entity173 or movies , and paying a rate and not all these add - ons , " he says			0
less hard booze today there 's far less hard liquor , complimentary or not			0
ten years ago , @entity37 yanked the petite bottles of liquor out of its chargeable minibars in its @entity4 hotel , citing low consumption			1
at @entity186 , miniature spirits were phased out in 2011			0
according to the property , " the hard liquor was removed as we prefer to tempt our guests with drinks and entertainment at our open air lounge bar vibes , and cocktail bar @entity193 with a live band			2
" only corporate or high - paying guests get the fully complimentary minibar			2
cheap trumps convenient the minibar is also increasingly part of an all - inclusive package			0
at @entity4 's @entity204 , the complimentary scheme is extensive : guests get a free minibar , breakfasts , plus two - hours free booze daily at its @entity209 , including all spirits and wine			2
removing the prices has also helped remove the headache of arguing with guests over what exactly they did or did not consume , says the hotel manager in @entity220 's @entity219 branch , @entity221			1
" it was a source of many disputes in hotels , " he says			0
" if the customer persists they had nothing , often hotels absorb the cost to not ruin guest relations over minibar items			0
" now , he does n't have to deal with that			0
@entity221 imagines a future in which the traditional minibar is extinct			0
" the competitor of the minibar is n't nearby hotels but the 24 - hour stores where one can get everything you need a few blocks away , " he says			1
the convenience of having a cold drink in your room is n't quite enough if you have to pay three times as much for it , it seems			2
will you miss minibars in hotel rooms or say good riddance to shockingly priced beer and @entity253 's ? leave a comment .			1
