@entity0 -- @entity3 authorities have ended the waiting game over when political pariah @entity5 will face court over corruption charges			1
but the question remains as to what message his trial and punishment will send to the @entity3 nation at a time when the @entity16 is pushing a mantra of anti-corruption and anti-excess			1
the @entity5 scandal emerged in march last year , just months before a once - in - a - decade leadership changeover that saw @entity22 replace @entity23 as president			2
at the time , the @entity26 chief was considered a high - flyer in the complex hierarchy of @entity3 politics			1
that ended when his police chief fled , seeking asylum with a wild story which later proved to be credible , that @entity5 's wife , @entity35 , and a family aide had murdered @entity38 businessman @entity37			1
more than one year later , @entity5 was charged bribery , corruption and abuse of power			1
he 'll face trial on thursday , but @entity43 , political science professor at the @entity44 , says the proceedings wo n't necessarily be about delivering justice			1
" it 's a political exercise , " @entity43 explained			0
" it is not a trial per se but a political settlement			0
" @entity5 's punishment will in part be retaliation for his audacity in challenging @entity23 , @entity22 and other top party leaders by pushing his own " @entity26 model " and engaging in public grandstanding , he said			1
" it is part of a political game , " @entity43 said			0
" there have been rumors that many other top leaders were supporting @entity5 , that @entity5 had ambitions to replace @entity22			2
even after @entity22 was formally installed as party chief last november , political bargaining continued and involved the question of how to deal with @entity5			1
" @entity43 says @entity22 will be glad to see the end of the matter			0
" @entity22 wants to clear the land mines ahead of the party meeting , which is expected later this year to launch reform and discuss economic and other important issues			0
" the leadership might want the issue out of the way , but @entity5 's punishment will send strong signals as to how serious the government is about cracking down on political corruption , some experts said			1
while the indictment did n't mention the specific amounts , sources tell @entity1 that @entity5 is accused of accepting about 20 million yuan ( $ 3.3m ) in bribes and embezzling six million yuan ( $ 1m )			2
as @entity26 chief , the charismatic @entity5 ruled with an iron - fist , cracking down on organized crime while promoting " red culture " that his critics said harked back to the authoritarian era under the late chairman @entity93			1
admirers credited @entity5 for advocating social equality and justice by providing affordable housing , and jailing abusive officials and gangsters			2
critics dismissed @entity5 as a " clown in @entity3 politics " for acting like an authoritarian strongman who resorted to extra-legal measures to get rid of his enemies , and as a " hypocrite " who took in populist positions while enjoying a luxurious and privileged life			1
" @entity5 's case is an individual case , " said @entity3 lawyer @entity110			1
" this has more to do with his personality			0
it does n't mean anything			0
he might not be very corrupt , but his strong personality and many ridiculous activities like ' singing red and smashing black ' have led to his downfall			0
" " my conclusion is , the case itself does n't mean much to @entity3 's anti-corruption campaign , but it sends a warning for people like him who would to anything to achieve their goals			1
" interactive : @entity3 's leaders : who 's who @entity131 , a @entity0 - based lawyer who has defended political dissidents , shares the skepticism			1
" i believe that anti-corruption in @entity3 is a systemic issue , not just about an individual case , " said @entity131			2
" many ordinary citizens believe that all government officials are corrupt , and no one should be allowed to slip through			0
this may be an extreme view but it reflects the view that anti-corruption in @entity3 is a systemic issue			2
" @entity5 , 64 , is a " taizidang " ( princeling ) , a term which refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence			0
his late father , @entity152 , was a revolutionary contemporary of @entity93 and former leader @entity154			0
over the past 30 years , @entity5 rose to power as a city mayor , provincial governor , minister of commerce and member of the @entity158 , the powerful policy making body of the @entity16			1
@entity5 caught public attention in 1993 when he became the deputy party secretary and mayor of @entity164			1
he was credited with the stellar success and transformation of @entity164 from an unremarkable port to a modernized city			0
he was later appointed governor of @entity170 in 2001			0
in 2004 , @entity5 finally got the chance to enter the elite central committee where he moved to @entity0 as the minister of trade and commerce			0
in 2007 , he was given a seat on the @entity158 and appointed party chief of @entity26 where he became well - known for running two major campaigns known as " chang hong da hei " -- singing red ( revolutionary songs ) and fight black ( organized crimes )			1
one was a campaign to promote @entity3 's communist past , including public singing of " red songs " , harking back to old communist values that generated nostalgia for the days of chairman @entity93			1
the other was a messy crackdown on crime and mafias			0
the @entity3 media is portraying the upcoming trial as a show of determination of the @entity3 leadership to combat corruption			2
" the indictment to @entity5 is already an improvement for @entity3 legal system , " wrote @entity198 on @entity199 , @entity3 's @entity200 - like microblogging site			1
" it shows the determination of the central government to fight against corruption			0
" " this is to prove no matter how powerful the person is , as long as he or she violates the law , there will be punishment , " chimed another netizen			0
" this is a fight among interest groups , and it is not the first time that this happens , " @entity216 posted on @entity199			0
" when @entity222 was in power , he removed ( former @entity0 mayor ) @entity224			0
it 's understandable that @entity22 wants to eliminate @entity5 , even @entity154 has removed ( @entity16 chief and rival ) @entity228			1
this is politics , no right or wrong			0
it 's just ' those who win become emperors , and those who lose become bandits '			0
" @entity5 's trial will be held in @entity237 , the capital city of @entity238 in eastern @entity3 , far away from his power base in @entity26 , where @entity5 still enjoys residual influence			1
the @entity3 authorities are expected to tightly stage - manage events -- unless @entity5 refuses to follow the script			2
a source close to @entity5 's family told @entity1 that @entity5 denies the charges and looks forward to having the opportunity to defend himself in court -- if he is allowed to be heard publicly			2
the @entity250 has reportedly decreed : " in coverage of the @entity5 trial , the media must use ( the state - run ) @entity257 wire copy without exception			2
do not independently investigate and do not use material from other sources			0
