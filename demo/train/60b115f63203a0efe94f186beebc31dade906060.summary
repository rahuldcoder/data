@entity0 -- president @entity2 on wednesday signed the @entity3 , calling it a " booster shot " for the @entity6 economy			1
" the bill i 'm signing today is large enough to have an impact , amounting to more than $ 152 billion this year , or about 1 percent of the gdp ( gross domestic product ) , " the president said in the brief ceremony in the @entity8 of the @entity9			1
the government hopes the measure , which will send most @entity6 tax rebate checks by may , will either prevent a recession or make one relatively brief			1
the package also includes tax breaks for equipment purchases by businesses , as well as payments to disabled veterans and some senior citizens			0
the bipartisan measure moved through @entity25 at relative break - neck speed , going from initial discussions to enactment in less than four weeks			1
the package will pay $ 600 to most individual taxpayers and $ 1,200 to married taxpayers filing joint returns , so long as they are below income caps of $ 75,000 for individuals and $ 150,000 for couples			1
there is also a $ 300 per child tax credit			2
watch @entity2 sign stimulus bill into law Â» the rebates will put about $ 120 billion in the hands of individuals in the hope that they will spend it and boost a faltering @entity6 economy			1
economists generally agree that the economy should see a boost from the rebate checks			1
but most also agree that the full impact will be less than the total value of the stimulus package			2
that 's because some recipients are expected to save their rebates or use them to pay down credit cards or other debt instead of spending it			0
in addition , some consumers may spend their rebates on imported items , which would provide a more limited lift to the @entity6 economy			0
" my guess is that of the $ 110 billion to $ 120 billion of tax rebates , about half will go to @entity6 products and services , " said @entity64 , chief economist for @entity65 's			2
there also are questions about whether the stimulus will actually be the key to ending or preventing a recession			0
treasury secretary @entity76 said last week that the @entity77 planned to send the rebate checks to about 130 million @entity6			1
" they 're going to be getting ready to get checks out , and believe me , they will			0
... and this is largely going to be done by the time summer 's over			0
and so we 're going to move quickly and make a difference , " he said @entity2 praised the quick work of the @entity9 and @entity88 and urged @entity6 not to " overreact " to the current economic troubles			2
" in the past seven years , the system has absorbed shocks : recession , corporate scandals , terror attacks , global war ; yet the genius of our system is that it can absorb such shocks and emerge even stronger , " he said			0
" in a dynamic market economy , our economy will prosper and it will continue to be the marvel of the world			0
