a time for family and friends , eggnog and mistletoe , carols and cookies ... and catching up on " @entity9 " ? apparently , that 's what legions of us had in mind when -- humbug ! -- the @entity16 streaming service went down			1
the outage , caused when some @entity20 servers used by @entity16 crashed , lasted more than 20 hours			1
like many companies , @entity16 pays to rent space on @entity20 's massive banks of servers			1
the outage , which affected devices such as tablets and smartphones , began at about 3:30 p.m. et monday			0
many @entity16 users had to scratch those plans to gather around the laptop for " it 's a @entity32 , " " @entity33 " or " @entity34 " ( the 2005 classic starring former wrestler @entity35 as a deranged @entity37 demon )			1
although for the desperate , " @entity38 " was available on @entity39			0
@entity16 said service was restored @entity2 morning			1
" special thanks to our awesome members for being patient			0
we 're back to normal streaming levels			0
we hope everyone has a great holiday , ' said the company on @entity49			1
still , the @entity50 was not amused -- which did n't stop some social - media users from trying to be amusing			0
here are some of our favorite @entity49 posts from the long winter night of our discontent : @entity55 ‏ ( @ chrisdelia ) " so @ netflix is down ? great			1
now everybody has to talk to their annoying family			0
" @entity60 ‏ ( @ @entity61 ) " @entity16 is down , most likely overloaded ... which means i 'm not the only one bored as hell at his parents house			1
. " @entity67 ‏ ( @ @entity68 ) " so depressed about @entity16 being down that all i wan na do is lie on the couch and watch @entity16			2
" @entity70 ( ‏ @ zamosta ) " @entity74 crashes on christmas eve , taking out @entity16 but not @entity20 video			1
somewhere , ( @entity20 ceo ) @entity75 reads " @entity78 " to his kids			2
" @entity79 ) ' " @entity80 and all through the house , not a @ netflix was streaming , not even @entity82			0
" @entity84 ( ‏ @ avantgame ) " @entity16 streaming , please come back online , i need to stream my fireplace in the @entity88 on my tv while we make gingerbread xoxo " @entity92 ‏ ( @ sophiavanelsber ) " @entity16 being broken is forcing me to get up and do something with my life # notcool " @entity95 in @entity96 ( @ @entity97 ) " @entity16 is down			2
@entity99 bad things happen to good people			0
" @entity101 ( ‏ @ joelbrave ) " thanks to @ netflix outage we can likely expect a moderate population explosion in nine months			0
" @entity107 ‏ ( @ lauren_mclaugh ) " how the @entity78 stole @entity16 ... " # @entity108 ‏ ( @ @entity109 ) " some kid probably asked @entity37 for # @entity16 to be down so his parents would pay attention to him			2
