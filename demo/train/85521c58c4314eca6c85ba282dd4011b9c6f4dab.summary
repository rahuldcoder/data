-- for the first few moments of her life , @entity1 was with her birth mother			2
for the next two years , she was with her adoptive parents			0
and for the last week , the toddler has been with her biological father , over 1,000 miles away from the only home she 'd ever known			1
it 's been a long , complicated journey for young @entity1 -- one made possible by a federal law meant " to protect the best interests of @entity14 children " that , in the process , has tugged at the heartstrings of all involved			1
the story began in 2009 , when @entity1 's biological mother and father , @entity19 , signed a legal document agreeing to put the girl up for adoption			1
@entity19 's attorney , @entity23 , says that her client signed the waiver but did n't quite understand it			1
soon after the girl was born , @entity19 -- a @entity26 soldier -- headed off on a 1 - year deployment			1
it was then that the baby moved on as well , to the @entity31 , @entity32 , home of @entity34 and @entity35			1
it was an open adoption , family friend @entity36 said			2
that meant the girl 's birth mother could and did maintain a relationship with the girl			1
but @entity19 , the biological father , was n't on board			1
four months after @entity1 's birth , he began legal proceedings seeking custody of her			2
" my client has been fighting for custody of his daughter since shortly after her birth , " @entity23 , @entity19 's @entity31 - based lawyer , said by e-mail			1
" he loves this child with all his heart			0
" @entity19 appeared to win that battle late last year			0
on @entity55 , he arrived in @entity32 , picked up @entity1 from her adoptive parents , and headed west to his home in @entity58			2
" it 's awful , " @entity59 said days later to @entity0 affiliate @entity60			0
" everyone keeps saying how bad they feel for us			0
but , i mean , she 's a 2 - year - old girl that got shoved in a truck and driven to @entity58 -- with strangers			1
" key to @entity19 's case is a 1978 federal law called the @entity71			1
its aim is to " promote the stability and security of @entity14 tribes and @entity14 families by the establishment of minimum federal standards to prevent the arbitrary removal of @entity14 children from their families and tribes and to ensure that measures which prevent the breakup of @entity14 families are followed in child custody proceedings			1
" @entity19 is enrolled in the @entity88 , a " federally - recognized government " of @entity90 that has " inherent sovereign status , " based near @entity92 , @entity58			0
that means young @entity1 has @entity14 blood , as well			2
@entity95 , assistant attorney general for the @entity88 , says that the protections inherent in the @entity71 are clear and important			0
@entity97 as she sees it , @entity19 -- as an @entity14 and the biological father of @entity1 -- is entitled to custody of the girl			1
" there 's a placement preference			0
if children are removed by the state or if they 're placed in private adoption , the first preference is for a family member , " @entity103 told @entity0 affiliate @entity104			0
@entity0 legal analyst @entity111 , for one , said the law was misused in this case			2
" it 's a wonderful law which seeks to protect the integrity of ... native @entity118 families , " she said			2
" but it can not be used as a bludgeon to destroy existing families			0
" @entity122 insists that @entity19 " would still be entitled to custody of his daughter under @entity32 law			1
" " it is important to understand that the @entity71 was not used as a loophole in this action , " the lawyer said			2
whatever the legal arguments , the emotions are still raw			0
the @entity133 have spoken to @entity1 once since she left , on @entity134			0
" she said , ' @entity135 ! hi daddy ! she sounded really excited to hear us			0
and she said , ' i love you ! ' numerous times , " @entity35 told @entity60			0
she added that her husband felt like he 'd failed as a father , sending her off with people she did n't know and not knowing what the little girl must think of them and the whole situation			1
@entity35 said she is worried about what 's next , and how @entity1 is getting through each day and night			0
" we just wish we could be there , if she was afraid , " she said .			0

a @entity14 *man* wins custody of his 2 - year - old biological daughter
she 'd been adopted by a @entity32 family soon after her birth
lawyer : the biological father did n't understand the waiver he signed
a federal law meant to protect @entity14 family breakup is key to the case
