when traveling through space , there are certain items you know you 're going to need			0
a spacesuit ? most likely			0
a towel ? some say it 's the most massively useful item you can have			0
for all the rest , @entity10 has a new plan : 3 - d printers			1
the agency plans to send a 3 - d printer to the @entity17 in june , when the fifth @entity19 supply mission is scheduled			1
in a video published monday , the agency explains that a functional 3 - d printer would help astronauts keep a steady supply of all the little parts needed to keep the 15 - year - old station in working order without having to deliver or find storage space for replacements			1
" @entity33 printing provides us the ability to do our own ' @entity37 ' replication right there on the spot , " @entity10 astronaut @entity30 says in the video			0
the printer would " help us replace things we 've lost , replace things we 've broken or maybe make things that we 've thought of that would be useful			2
" @entity10 will be able to load software for items it knows the astronauts will need onto the printer beforehand but also will be able to upload new ones from @entity51 if needed			1
a model of the proposed 3 - d printer , from private company @entity54 , recently passed a battery of tests at @entity10 's @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59			1
chief among the questions addressed : whether the printer can withstand the pressure of a launch and how it would perform in " micro-gravity " aboard the space station			2
" the 3d printing experiment with @entity10 is a step towards the future , " @entity54 ceo @entity67 said in a news release when the partnership was announced			0
" the ability to 3d - print parts and tools on demand greatly increases the reliability and safety of space missions while also dropping the cost by orders of magnitude			0
" @entity83 , @entity10 's point person on the project , said 3 - d printing will significantly improve efficiency and convenience for astronauts			1
" as you might imagine on @entity90 , whatever you have available in orbit is what they have to use , " she said			0
" just like on the ground , you have parts that break or get lost			0
when that happens , you do have to wait for replacement parts , or we have to use multiple spares that have to be launched -- which does require extra mass. " so what types of things could easily be lost and reproduced on the printer ? in the video , @entity30 mentions tools used on the space station and small pieces of storage racks used to anchor them down			2
but a 3 - d printer could also be used to replicate more ambitious items in space -- someday , maybe even a pizza .			1

@entity10 plans to launch a 3 - d printer to the @entity17
the tool will let astronauts replace lost or broken items
launching spares takes up space and adds *weight* to launches
printer will be ready in june for a @entity19 mission to the station
