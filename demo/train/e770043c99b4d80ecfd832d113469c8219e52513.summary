-- in recent days , international attention has refocused on the rapidly deteriorating security situation in @entity3			1
the claim of responsibility for the attack on @entity7 on december 25 by @entity8 has underscored the fact that @entity3 's problems will not stay in @entity3			1
in the absence of immediate and sustained attention by the international community , @entity3 may be overwhelmed by a unique convergence of crises			1
while some observers feared this would come in several years , it is increasingly apparent that failure may come sooner than previously expected			0
@entity3 has frequently been described as a failing state -- and with good reason			1
civil war , terrorism , a deepening secessionist movement and economic and demographic trends threaten to overpower the @entity3 government , provide a breeding ground for terrorists and destabilize the region			1
@entity3 has often teetered on the brink of collapse , but it has never faced so many interconnected challenges at one time			1
at the heart of the country 's problems is a looming economic crisis			0
oil is the source of nearly 80 percent of government revenue , and it is quickly running out			2
there are few viable options for a sustainable post-oil economy , and @entity3 is already the poorest country in the @entity45 world with an unemployment rate conservatively estimated at 35 percent			2
@entity3 's pending economic collapse has been greatly accelerated by the civil war in @entity49			1
government forces have been unable to decisively put down the rebels in the north of the country , and there is no military solution to the conflict			0
the toll in @entity49 has been severe , with extensive damage to infrastructure and an estimated 175,000 internally displaced people			0
the conflict 's strain on the @entity3 army has led to questions about the military 's ability to simultaneously engage in other operations , including counterterrorism			1
the government is spending foreign currency reserves at an alarming rate , recently estimated at more than $ 200 million per month			0
spending on the war will create a major budget deficit next year			0
every dollar spent on the civil war is a dollar not spent on addressing the underlying causes of instability in @entity3			1
@entity3 also is facing a growing secessionist movement in the south of the country			2
when the war in @entity49 subsides , it is feared that the secessionist movement will again flare up			0
the government does not control the entire territory of @entity3 , and the emergence of additional areas outside of the capital of @entity89 's control will create more under - governed spaces that can be exploited by terrorist movements			2
for the past year , there have been growing indications that @entity8 is regrouping in @entity3 and preparing to strike @entity95 and other targets			1
recent counterterrorism measures in @entity97 have forced extremists to seek refuge elsewhere , and analysts have observed a steady flow of extremists relocating to @entity3 's under - governed areas			2
in spring 2008 , @entity8 operatives in @entity97 were encouraged by local @entity106 commanders to escape to @entity3 , and by january 2009 , the @entity97 and @entity108 affiliates merged			1
a video announcing the establishment of @entity8 featured two @entity97 previously released from the @entity112 military detention center at @entity113 , @entity114 -- both assumed leadership positions in the newly formed organization			2
@entity118 subsequently surrendered to @entity97 authorities and @entity120 reportedly escaped a recent counterterrorism strike that preceded the @entity123 bombing			0
the emergence of the regional @entity8 group marks a major deterioration of security in @entity3			1
as recent events have highlighted , @entity3 is becoming a base for @entity8 to mount operations not only inside the country but also across the @entity132 and internationally			1
in august 2009 , @entity8 nearly assassinated prince @entity133 , the @entity97 counterterrorism chief , in an attack that was eerily similar to the @entity123 bomb attack			2
following the attack on @entity137 , it boasted of its new bomb technology and threatened to use its new ' undetectable substance ' again			0
and in mid-october , several @entity97 were killed trying to cross into @entity97 , including the brother of deputy commander @entity120			0
according to local press reports , the two were attempting to smuggle several suicide vests into @entity97			0
@entity8 was allegedly bolstered by the relocation of @entity8 operatives from @entity146 and @entity147 this summer			2
media reports quoted intelligence sources saying that fighters fleeing from @entity151 were seeking safe havens in @entity3 and @entity153			1
any single event -- or more likely a confluence of worst - case events beyond the ability of the @entity3 government to control -- could lead to a further erosion of central government authority in @entity3 and destabilization of the region			1
as the central government 's authority and legitimacy continue to deteriorate , there will be more opportunities for extremists directed or inspired by @entity8 to regroup , organize , train and launch operations against @entity112 and allied targets throughout the @entity173 region and globally			1
military operations to kill or capture @entity8 operatives will likely increase in 2010			2
publicly acknowledged @entity112 involvement in counterterrorism operations in @entity3 would be deeply unpopular in the country , likely undermine the legitimacy of the @entity3 government and feed into the grievances that help fuel @entity8 militancy			1
development assistance is one of the most effective tools available to address the interconnected long - term challenges facing @entity3			1
but , @entity112 aid is disproportionately small considering the magnitude of the problems facing the country and @entity3 's strategic importance to the @entity112			0
in addition to the reported $ 70 million of military and security assistance , the @entity112 recently announced $ 121 million in development aid over the next three years , a significant increase from previous years and a vital step in the right direction			0
still , the amount pales in comparison to the $ 1.5 billion allotted to @entity146 in the next year alone			0
this disparity persists even as @entity112 officials increasingly cite @entity3 as a terrorism and security priority second only to @entity147 and @entity146			0
no perfect solutions exist for @entity3 's problems today , and none of its many pressing challenges can be fully averted			1
however , steps can be taken to lessen their impact			0
the @entity112 has a stake in helping @entity3 deal with its problems , and the cost of inaction would be too great			0
failure to act now would lead to fewer and even worse options in the future			0
as one administration official recently said to me , " we 've seen this movie before , and we know how it ends			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			0
