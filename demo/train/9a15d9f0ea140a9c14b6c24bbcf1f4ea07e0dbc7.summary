@entity1 's annexation of @entity2 , and what many fear is its apparent threat to invade @entity6 , has riveted international attention since the crisis erupted with february 's revolution in @entity10			1
excitable talk has proliferated as fast as @entity13 missiles			0
pundits obsess about a new @entity15 , a showdown with " mad bad @entity16 , and the resulting need to boost military spending ( always a @entity20 favorite )			0
the talk is all @entity6 , @entity6			1
politicians and diplomats have put everything else on hold			0
including @entity25 , which is a big mistake			1
far more than an argument over an obscure shard of territory on the edge of @entity32 , the catastrophe now taking place in and around @entity25 ranks as a fundamental challenge and threat to the current world order			1
@entity25 , not @entity2 , directly affects western security in very basic ways			1
what 's happening there is changing the power balance in the @entity42			0
and unlike in @entity6 or the @entity45 republics or other @entity47 lands , a vast human catastrophe is unravelling , apparently without end			2
in @entity25 's real , not phoney , war , more than 100,000 people have died so far			1
the total number of @entity25 refugees in @entity54 , for example , has now passed the 1 million mark , according to the @entity57 's refugee agency -- and that does not include the tens of thousands who have not registered with the agency			1
about 12,000 are fleeing @entity25 for @entity54 each week			2
the refugee outflow is also affecting @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
as the war enters its fourth year , the overall refugee total is around 2.5 million			0
a further 6.5 million @entity25 are internally displaced , and 9.3 million are in need of humanitarian assistance , according to the @entity57 the suffering concealed behind these bald figures is appalling , as any visitor to the refugee camps will testify			2
children are particularly badly affected			0
yet even if they are not swayed by the human cost of a conflict that has become depressingly familiar , basic considerations of self - interested realpolitik suggest governments , politicians and diplomats should be paying more attention to @entity25			1
one obvious reason is the way the war has been exploited to facilitate the spread of @entity87 fundamentalism			0
large areas of northern @entity25 are now under the control of jihadi groups and militias who , whatever else they may disagree about , are united in their opposition to western values and interests			1
@entity25 is in the process of becoming a bridgehead to @entity99 for @entity100 and like - minded fanatics			1
it is already a magnet for young @entity99 @entity105 men who want a piece of the global jihad			2
they then bring their new " skills " home			0
a second reason to take a second look at @entity25 is the way instability there is steadily spreading outwards to affect neighboring countries			2
@entity63 's @entity117 government , having initially tried to broker a peace deal , now regards itself as virtually at war with @entity121 's regime			0
last week the @entity63 very deliberately shot down a @entity25 warplane they said had violated their airspace			2
the threat of a @entity25 - @entity63 conflict aside , the impact on @entity63 's politics and people has been considerable			1
the increasingly authoritarian behaviour of @entity130 , @entity63 's prime minister , to some degree reflects the pressure the country is under			0
@entity135 militants trying to make common cause with their divided @entity25 counterparts is one concern			2
another is that border areas inundated with refugees are becoming less governable			0
growing instability and consequent political uncertainty are also affecting pro-western @entity54 and @entity62 , while apparently reviving @entity146 - @entity145 conflict in @entity65 is being fed by the @entity25 flames			1
recent reports suggest many @entity65 @entity146 fighters are now inside @entity25 , determined ( like the @entity151 fighters from @entity54 ) to bolster the @entity121 regime against its mostly @entity145 foes			2
in geopolitical terms , the @entity25 collapse has provided @entity156 with an opportunity to extend its influence into the heart of the @entity161 world , opening up a new front in its proxy war with the @entity145 monarchies of the @entity165 led by @entity166			2
no doubt to @entity156 's delight , @entity168 's displeasure at the @entity171 administration 's refusal to get directly involved in @entity25 has caused a rift between the two long - time allies			1
given the current state of western relations with @entity177 , handing @entity156 a free boost in this way is a serious diplomatic own goal			0
the ongoing failure to address and resolve the @entity25 conflict has numerous other far - reaching consequences			1
what goes for @entity156 goes for @entity1 , too			0
its obstinate and unprincipled support for @entity121 has come cost - free as the @entity187 and @entity99 dither and the @entity190 " peace process " leads precisely nowhere			1
perceived @entity187 weakness over @entity25 may even have encouraged @entity192 in his @entity2 misdemeanors			1
@entity195 's continued survival as @entity25 's head of state is an egregious affront to the @entity198 and its various related @entity25 resolutions , to the @entity57 charter , to international law , and specifically to international war crimes legislation			1
@entity195 stands accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity , not least over the use by his forces of chemical weapons against civilian populations			0
but once again , nothing much is done , and the credibility of such institutions and laws suffers as a result			0
the moral example set by such dereliction is shocking			0
a lot has been made of the bad precedent russia set by annexing the territory of an independent sovereign state			0
and it is fair to say such behavior is unacceptable and illegal , and should not be emulated by others			0
but in the overall scheme of things , the @entity2 problem fades into insignificance when set alongside the dreaded ramifications and implications , short and long term , of the international community 's plain inability or its lamentable lack of will to halt the @entity25 war .			1

@entity1 's annexation of @entity2 , and feared threat to invade @entity6 , has *grabbed* attention
@entity241 says @entity25 , not @entity2 , directly affects western security in more basic ways
much of northern @entity25 under control of jihadi groups , united in opposition to @entity248 - @entity241
@entity25 is in the process of becoming a bridgehead to @entity99 for @entity100 , he adds
