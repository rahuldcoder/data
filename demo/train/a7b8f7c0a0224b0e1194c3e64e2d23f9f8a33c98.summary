@entity0 -- on tuesday , the @entity2 votes to elect its next president			1
for @entity2 , the choice is about which candidate will improve the economy , healthcare , the employment rate and ensure better living standards			2
however , for @entity12 citizens living in the country 's northwest , especially for the 800,000 people in the tribal region of @entity17 , the @entity2 election is a question of life and death			1
@entity21 lives in @entity22 , a small town in @entity17 , and is an elder of the @entity25 tribe			0
he told me that more than 200 people from his tribe have been killed through the @entity30 - run clandestine drone program in the last seven years			1
thanks to @entity12 local channels which translated all three presidential debates into @entity34 , @entity21 has paid close attention to every word uttered by president @entity37 and governor @entity38			1
just like these candidates , @entity21 is also responsible for the wellbeing of his people			0
he has to ensure that his tribe 's young have stable jobs , children can go to school and sick people are treated in the best possible way			0
@entity21 listened very carefully when @entity37 said he would further strengthen health care , improve employment , raise taxes on the rich and improve public education			2
such promises were doubled by @entity38 , who said that he would do even better if elected president			2
this was all good news for @entity2 voting in the elections			2
but when it came to matters concerning @entity21 and his tribe 's people , there was no good news			0
both @entity37 and @entity38 promised to continue with drone warfare that has targeted northwest @entity12 if elected			1
this means that @entity21 still has to live with the fear that any of his tribe 's women , children or men like him are all potential targets , as reports suggest the @entity30 considers every male of able military age a potential terrorist in @entity17 it means his 9 - year - old will still not go to school due to fear that his school might be targeted by a drone			1
it means people will still not attend funerals , have large weddings or conduct their fruit export or mining businesses openly			0
drone strikes started under president @entity88 but were escalated in real sense by president @entity37 since he took office in 2009			1
according to the @entity93 , more than 3,300 people have been killed in more than 350 drone strikes during the last nine years			1
so far , according to our estimates , these strikes have only killed 41 of the @entity99 - linked individuals who were meant to be the real targets of the drone program			1
no names are known of all the others killed , and the @entity30 expects @entity2 to accept their word that everyone killed in a drone strike is a terrorist posing an imminent threat to the @entity2			1
in a recent conversation with an @entity2 diplomat in @entity0 , i was astonished when he said to me that civilian deaths number only in two digits , according to their records			2
i was further shocked when i asked him if he knows about independent sources that report on civilian deaths such as the @entity93 , or the recent report compiled by @entity119 and @entity120 universities			0
the diplomat looked completely lost			0
why do @entity2 presidents love drone technology ? the obvious answer lies in @entity2 politics			1
any president at war can not afford large numbers of @entity2 soldiers coming back in coffins			0
but the @entity2 would like to keep its hegemony , and drone technology makes this dream a reality			1
now the @entity2 can wage war anywhere in world without putting @entity2 troops on ground , and the resulting loss of political capital			0
drone warfare is also keeping the very strong @entity2 defense lobby happy and busy with new technology			1
but @entity21 tells me this does not work for him , his people and certainly not for peace in the region			0
policies like drone attacks , extrajudicial murders committed by a state , and covert programs like rendition and secret prisons in timid allied states not only kill people -- they decimate any hope for peace			1
these killings help extremists recruit more discontented youth			0
a person in tribal society who has lost his family members in this manner is bound by the @entity166 honor code -- @entity167 -- to retaliate and opt for " badal " ( revenge or justice )			0
there is growing anti-american sentiment in regions affected by drone attacks and some people are tempted to resort to illegal means when the system does not deliver justice to them			2
this discontent is spreading among @entity181			0
@entity12 - born @entity2 citizen @entity182 is one example of this as he cited drones as one reason for his failed attempt to car bomb @entity120 's @entity188			2
@entity21 worries when he listens to war - mongering presidential candidates and wonders if he ever will be successful in preaching peace to his kinsmen if the opponent has only contempt , and a message of death for his people			0
@entity21 wishes that @entity197 were also able to vote in @entity2 elections .			0

@entity37 and @entity38 both say they will continue the @entity30 - run drone program
according to one report , the program has killed more than 3300 people in nine years
the attacks are breeding resentment against @entity2 , says @entity209
