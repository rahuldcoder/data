the @entity1 @entity0 recently announced that the unemployment rate fell to 8.2 %			1
that should have been a signal that jobs are coming back and that the economy is about to rebound			1
but , as many economists say , the numbers fell primarily because unemployed @entity1 have become so discouraged with trying to find a job that they 've simply quit looking			1
because nearly one - third of the @entity1 middle class , mostly families with children , have fallen into poverty or are one paycheck away from poverty , it is paramount that we dissect the root causes of this mass disenfranchisement within the @entity1 workforce			1
this was the motivation behind " @entity24 : a call to conscience , " our 18 - city bus tour that traveled across the country last year			0
it was designed to bring more attention to the plight of impoverished @entity1			0
these citizens do not fit the negative stereotypes and propaganda that we 've heard during the @entity35 presidential primary contests			0
the candidates who have vowed to cut government subsidies speak of the poor as if their constituents had been exempted from the millions who , despite their middle - class identification and aspirations , now fall beneath the established poverty line			1
the people we met are n't lazy or eager to live off so - called government entitlements			1
we spoke with formerly middle - class parents who were thrust into poverty when one or both lost their salaries			1
we heard the stories of single mothers and fathers , military veterans and former high - wage employees desperately trying to re-enter a workforce that no longer pays living wages			1
@entity58 , a 54 - year - old @entity59 , @entity60 , resident , was one of those faces of poverty we met on the tour			1
unemployed for three years , @entity58 has gone from making " $ 60,000 a year to less than $ 15,000 overnight			1
" her husband is disabled and dependent on medicines the couple can no longer afford			0
they rely on food stamps , which , @entity58 says , " is depressing as hell			0
" receiving government aid , however , has not been as depressing as her job search			0
@entity58 says she has applied for at least 300 jobs			1
even though she can barely afford gas , she drives to the interviews only to learn that the employers want to hire younger candidates at low wages			0
the experiences have taken a toll : " i 've aged 10 years in the three years that i 've been looking for a job , " @entity58 told us			0
" i want to get a job so i can just relax and exhale ... but i ca n't			2
after a while you just give up			0
" like @entity58 , millions of @entity1 are just giving up on the possibility of ever rejoining the workforce			0
these frustrations reflect a reality that is unraveling the @entity1 identity			0
one of the most fundamental dictates in achieving the " @entity93 " has always been a good job that pays wages decent enough to care for our families , buy a car and a home , and live reasonably comfortable lives			1
what has caused so many to quit looking for jobs and , by extension , abandon the @entity93 ? we argue that a covenant has been broken with the @entity1 people			1
we live in a society where corporations put profits over people			1
we march to the beat of political leaders who have decided the richest 1 % of the people in this country deserve generous tax breaks and preferential treatment while most of the 99 % are forced to pay unbalanced shares of the tax burden and live on less and less			1
unemployment has been discussed in sound bites within the framework of the @entity122			0
reporters and pundits pontificate about the housing and home - lending fiasco , the collapse of @entity128 and the amount of construction , manufacturing and government jobs lost as a result of the market 's economic downturn			1
yet economists and politicians propose failed remedies based on rebuilding and rebooting systems that have already dashed the @entity93 for many			1
economist @entity141 , for example , suggests dynamic job growth will be sparked by increasing domestic oil production , tackling the trade imbalance with @entity145 , relaxing regulations for big businesses and curbing health care mandates			0
not only do these efforts lack the innovation necessary to meet the demands of a burgeoning world economy , they also do nothing to change the nation 's capitalist equation that renders everyday @entity1 irrelevant			1
" fair trade " with @entity145 will not interrupt the transportation of construction , manufacturing and production jobs overseas in exchange for huge profits			2
fat - cat executives running investment firms , banks , insurance , health care and pharmaceutical companies might like to curb health care mandates , but that approach certainly does n't address the needs of @entity1 looking for decent wages and affordable health care			2
the @entity176 's regressive @entity175 decision in many ways validates a truism			0
the court basically ruled that corporations are people			1
and like all @entity1 , corporations have the free speech rights and can spend whatever they want on political ads without disclosing who they are or exposing their agendas			2
so , in a very real sense , corporations are people -- super-rich , self - serving people who can use their billions to influence elections at the expense of , well , real people			1
most major corporations are run by the Ã¼ber - rich -- the same people who shipped @entity1 jobs overseas , broke the backs of labor unions , pay a fraction of the salaries once paid for manufacturing jobs , turned full - time work into part - time positions , and snatched health care benefits away from employees			1
and many companies have even established " unemployed need not apply " policies			2
in other words , if you do n't have a job when it 's time to apply , you ca n't get the job			2
when the " need not apply " story broke late last year , more than 6 million @entity1 had been out of work for six months or more			0
talk about kicking people when they 're down			2
during our poverty tour last year , we met countless people caught in vicious cycles of looking for nonexistent jobs because their unemployment benefits were expiring or had run out , scraping change together for gas to go on interviews that may or may not pan out , and having to swap food stamps for cash to keep the lights or gas on in the house			1
frustrations are especially high among young people dealing with an 18 % unemployment rate -- a more than 60 - year high			2
we attended a town hall meeting in @entity235 during our poverty tour where parents complained of 25 - year - olds who came of working age before the @entity122 who have never had a job in their lives			2
the newly launched @entity244 campaign is centered around the fact that 20 % of young workers have been out of work for a year or longer , jobs are scarce , and the cumulative student loan debt is more than $ 1 trillion			2
" our generation has been hit far worse than any other , " said @entity249 , 28 , part of the group of young people who started the campaign			2
" we represent the broken dream of @entity1 , and we ca n't let it continue			2
" that dream has been broken for youths and adults all over the country			0
many single mothers have stopped looking for work for the sake of their children 's health			0
because of deficit budget cuts , states are either eliminating or tightening eligibility requirements for child care programs that used to serve the working poor			0
more cuts are on the way , but , for the moment , children of women on welfare have access to basic health care			0
but previously eligible low - wage - earning parents are now either denied assistance or their children are placed on interminable waiting lists			2
it has reached the point where struggling parents have to choose between a low - wage job and welfare so their children can receive basic medical attention			0
a person can survive in the jungle for only so long before his or her spirit breaks			0
and the spirit of the @entity1 workforce is approaching a breaking point			0
today 's staggering unemployment is n't the stepchild of the @entity122			0
it is the illegitimate offspring of a long - abided system that places the profits and concerns of big business and the mega-rich above the rest of us			0
the cancer of greed has spread throughout the body of @entity1 and surgery based on pre-recession strategies wo n't cure the disease			0
the inconvenient truth is that @entity1 itself is in need of a transfusion of economic equity and radical reform			0
everyday people must recognize that their lives matter just as much as the lives of the rich			1
a workplace rooted in fundamental fairness that provides decent living wage jobs will allow frustrated , unemployed workers like @entity58 to breathe again , and give them a chance to become revitalized contributing members of society			1
it 's time to resuscitate the @entity93 .			1

**writers** : *jobless* numbers fell , but many discouraged unemployed just quit looking
middle class is slipping into poverty , they say , and the few jobs left do n't pay living wage
our society has lost covenant with people and made a pact with corporations , they write
**writers** : only radical change for everyday people , not @entity349 , will save @entity93
