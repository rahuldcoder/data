the alleged attackers also are juveniles , but they have been identified by a judge in court , by defense attorneys and in newspapers and other media reports as @entity43 and @entity44 , both 16			1

@entity48 has released information about the town and the football team and is threatening to release more unless everyone comes clean about what happened that august night			2
" the town of @entity65 has been good at keeping this quiet and their star football team protected , " an @entity48 member wearing the group 's trademark @entity57 mask says in a video posted to the group 's @entity62 website			2

crime blogger @entity144 , a former @entity65 resident , discovered and preserved many of the messages , at least some of which are now in the hands of authorities			1
she first spotted the story in the small town 's newspaper and started looking into the situation on a hunch that the highly regarded football team 's members were getting special treatment at the expense of the victim			1
" when i first came across the article , i just felt like -- because it was involving football players , and there is a culture there that football is very important , that there was probably a little more to this story than what the local media was reporting , " she told @entity0 thursday			1
" so i started doing my own research			2
" one image circulated online and posted on a website maintained by @entity48 showed the girl , dressed in a t - shirt and blue shorts , her body limp , being held hand and foot by two males who appear to be teenagers			0

@entity0 has not been able to establish whether this is true			0
in one 12 - minute video , posted by @entity48 on wednesday , one teenager makes joke after joke about the girl 's condition , saying she must have died because she did n't move during one assault			0
@entity48 and others in the video identified the teen by a name that does n't match the two who were charged , but @entity0 can not independently confirm his identity			0

" " she 's trying to go about her life right now , which is difficult because of all the media attention , " said family attorney @entity250			1
" it 's as if she 's just flown into this barnstorm			0
she 'll make it through			0
" the case is now in the hands of special prosecutors under @entity31 attorney general @entity260			1

" the parents of one teenager named on @entity188 's blog sued her for defamation and sought to have those who anonymously commented on the blog about the case publicly identified			0
the family has since dropped the lawsuit , according to court documents			0
meanwhile , @entity48 says it is collecting detailed information about the personal affairs of football boosters and others in the town of 18,000 who the group claims may have helped cover up the attack			0
