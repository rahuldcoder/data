-- some know @entity2 as the @entity4 's all - time leading rusher			1
others recognize him as a three - time @entity7 champion or a @entity9 winner			2
but do you really know who @entity2 is ? until he traced his genealogy for the @entity14 reality series " @entity15 " , @entity2 says he did n't even know the answer to that question			1
to find out more about himself and the family members who paved the way for his success , this hall - of - fame inductee followed his roots to @entity24 , @entity25 , the town where his great - grandmother was born			1
" i feel like a detective on a hunt trying to find clues , " he says			2
in @entity24 , @entity2 wandered into a convenience store and asked a clerk if he knew two of his relatives , @entity32 and @entity34			1
coincidentally , @entity35 , the clerk , turned out to be @entity2 's second cousin			1
@entity0 : how to dig up your own family history @entity2 soon learned that his great - great - grandmother , @entity39 , had an unusual maiden name -- @entity41			1
genealogist @entity42 told @entity2 that " @entity41 " was probably the name of a slave owner			1
" african - americans , at the end of the @entity46 , sometimes picked the names of their last slave owner , " she says			1
the next step ? @entity2 went in search of @entity39 's parents ' names			1
in an old ledger , @entity42 found a man named prince @entity41 who was described with the letter " m , " which meant mulatto			1
" specifically , black / white race , " she says			0
@entity0 : @entity59 uncovers his genetic roots they also discovered that @entity41 's mom was a woman named @entity63			1
" now , i know that @entity41 was mixed race and born into slavery , " @entity2 says			1
" if @entity63 was his mother , could she be the link between the black and the white side of my family ? " to explore this theory , @entity2 traveled to @entity72 , @entity73 , to learn more about a notorious slave trader who owned @entity63 at some point in history			1
the man 's name was @entity41			1
@entity73 historian @entity79 said @entity80 , @entity41 's father , might be the link to @entity63			1
to find out for sure , @entity79 selected a book of old deeds from a shelf			0
the number on the book was 22 -- the same number @entity2 wore on the football field for 15 years			1
" i 've been wearing jersey number 22 since college , " he says			0
" maybe it is my destiny , and i 've always believed i was a child of destiny , but , whew , this is ... it 's making me a little bit nervous			2
" @entity2 says the family history he unearthed in book 22 shook him to the core			1
@entity79 helped him find a property deed stating that @entity63 was transferred from @entity80 to his son , @entity41			2
" @entity80 probably had her bred , " @entity79 says			0
" then , when she got old enough , he gave her to his son			0
... they raised and bred horses , and raised and bred slaves			0
" " in other words , the horses were more important than any slaves that they ever had , " @entity2 says			2
" they treated my people like animals ... but worse than animals			1
" the deed stated that @entity63 was passed down along with a horse bridle and a saddle			0
" she was such a young woman , " @entity2 says			2
" i have a 13 - year - old daughter right now , and i have a 10 - year - old daughter right now			0
i could n't imagine them being passed down through slavery that way			0
" professor @entity125 , a domestic slave trade historian , says it 's safe to assume that @entity80 was , in fact , @entity63 's father			0
" @entity41 was engaged in this horrible , horrible traffic and why he did n't sell @entity63 is because he recognized @entity63 as his sister , " @entity125 says			2
after discovering the horrors his family endured , @entity2 says he 's even more thankful for the power of progress			1
" i thank @entity135 for people who stood up for equality for all of us , " he says			0
@entity2 says he felt the true power of his newfound knowledge while sitting on the porch of an old slave quarters in @entity143 , @entity25			1
" that house down in @entity143 is where i started to put things together , " he says			0
" and right then and there , i sensed that my ancestors were crying out to me because they were lost for so many years , and here , their great - great - grandson is going on the journey to find who they were			1
" while @entity2 sat on the porch , it started to rain			2
" it was coming to me all at one time , and it was incredible , " he says			0
" oftentimes , people want closure , and i felt like my folks did not have closure			2
at that time , when i found that information , i felt like they were crying out , ' we got closure now			0
' " after learning what he could from dusty record books , @entity2 took the next step in his genealogical journey and had a dna test			2
the results showed him that he 's 81 percent @entity169 , 12 percent @entity170 and 7 percent @entity171 , which is most likely @entity173 ancestry			0
@entity2 's journey has come to an end , but he encourages anyone who 's curious about their roots to follow in his footsteps			2
" you must go do this yourself , " he says			0
" it 's extremely important			0
it will help shape your vision in terms of how you go forward			0
it will also help you appreciate your past			0
