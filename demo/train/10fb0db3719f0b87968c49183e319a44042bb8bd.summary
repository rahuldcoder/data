@entity0 , @entity1 -- we 've all seen them on the train or the bus			2
@entity7 glued to their chest , thumbs hovering and their eyes locked in a digitally - induced trance			2
but according to a @entity17 occupational psychologist , persistent monitoring of your @entity14 will increase stress levels and most likely decrease productivity too			1
@entity20 from @entity21 studied the @entity14 habits of a group of executives in middle to senior management who were either high or low frequency users			1
" high " users would typically switch on their @entity14 during the commute to work and would keep them on in the evenings and during weekends			1
" @entity33 " users would generally allocate specific times to check their @entity14 and respond to emails			1
" people who fell into the high user category tend to have a distorted perception of their own usage and they equate their @entity14 use with being dedicated to the job , " @entity20 told @entity2			1
but these displays of enthusiasm did n't translate into efficiency			2
in one example @entity20 observed a high frequency user trying to complete a simple spreadsheet			2
the task , @entity20 estimates , should have taken about 20 minutes but ended up taking three times as long because of @entity14 monitoring			1
the knock - on effect of this disruption is the anxiety it creates			0
" you 're not finishing what you are supposed to be doing			0
the dependency it creates when you ca n't find it , or it buzzes when you ca n't do anything about it because you are in a meeting causes stress , " he said			1
while high users are driven to distraction , their partners are sometimes compelled to destruction			0
i heard a story of one being flushed down the toilet , " @entity20 said			0
@entity20 advises companies whose employees have been issued with a smartphone to at least provide a basic level of training			1
" you need to know how to use it properly			0
after all , we get training when every other technology comes online , " @entity20 said			0
he suggests companies try to encourage their employees to set a limit on usage			1
of course , there are going to be exceptions -- but on the whole @entity20 recommends a maximum of 12 hours use during the working week			1
on a personal level , @entity20 advice is simple : " at the start of any task , turn it off ! interruptions do n't help anyone do anything better , faster or at a higher quality			0
" he added that research suggests people who respond to emails in batches take much less time doing it and are better at it			1
with more people upgrading to smartphones , issues over productivity and stress will surely rise as more executives find the line between work and leisure time blurring			1
it 's a trend which concerns @entity114 , professor of organizational psychology and health at @entity17 's @entity116			0
" we are finding that people are working on their paid work in what used to be their leisure time and that 's having consequences both for their health and their productivity , " @entity114 told @entity2			0
" remember , all these technologies are supposed to be our social support system			0
but what they 've ended up being is an umbilical cord back to the workplace even in our non-work roles in life			0
" i think what 's ended up happening is the technology is managing the people rather than the people managing the technology , " he added			0
@entity114 believes the recession has perhaps compounded the problem as people feel more job insecure but he urges executives to seize the initiative			2
" the thing that causes people the most stress in life is not having control			2
if you are on holiday , access it once every two days , explain to someone that you are away and you 'll deal with it when you get back			0

executives *constantly* using their @entity14 are less productive says study
stress levels heightened by overuse , which also feed feelings of dependency
psychologist advises to respond to email in batches and limit use to 12 hours daily
