@entity0 -- under furious assault from conservative @entity4 , the @entity2 backtracked tuesday on its surprisingly positive assessment of gays and same - sex relationships			1
in a report monday , the @entity2 had said that gays and lesbians have " gifts to offer " the @entity15 community and acknowledged that same - sex couples can give " precious support " to one other			1
the statement , an interim report from a closely watched meeting of @entity20 clergy here , was widely praised by liberals			2
it is believed to be the first time the @entity2 has said anything positive about gay relationships			1
one longtime @entity2 journalist called the statement a " pastoral earthquake			2
" but many conservatives complained that the statement watered down church teaching and did not accurately reflect their discussions here , where nearly 200 @entity20 leaders are meeting to debate pastoral approaches to modern family life			0
one @entity37 cardinal called monday 's statement , which also included positive language about unmarried couples who cohabitate , " irredeemable			2
" " the message has gone out that this is what the synod is saying , this is what the @entity4 is saying , " said cardinal @entity42 , referring to the special meeting of catholic clergy gathered here through saturday			2
" it 's not what we 're saying at all			0
" in response to such reactions , the @entity2 backtracked a bit tuesday			1
in a statement , it said the report on gays and lesbians was a " working document , " not the final word from @entity0			1
the @entity2 also said that it wanted to welcome gays and lesbians in the church , but not create " the impression of a positive evaluation " of same - sex relationships , or , for that matter , of unmarried couples who live together			1
but gay rights groups say that 's precisely the impression the @entity2 gave monday when it said : " homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer to the @entity15 community			1
are we capable of welcoming these people , guaranteeing to them a fraternal space in our communities ? often they wish to encounter a church that offers them a welcoming home			0
are our communities capable of providing that , accepting and valuing their sexual orientation , without compromising @entity20 doctrine on the family and matrimony ? " such statements seem to be in line with the more merciful approach the church has taken toward gays and lesbians under @entity92			2
in 2013 , @entity92 famously said , " who am i to judge ? " gay people			0
on monday morning , just before the @entity2 released its positive report on gays , @entity92 preached that laws that do not lead people to @entity98 are " dead ; " what 's more , @entity105 did " strange things " such as hanging out with sinners and tax collectors , the @entity92 preached , seemingly tipping his hand about the @entity2 's direction			1
the overarching goal of the meeting here , officially called the @entity108 of @entity109 , is to present proposals for a larger gathering to be held in october 2015			0
which means there 's a long road ahead before any doctrinal or pastoral changes happen in the church			0
in the meantime , conservative and liberal bishops have been fiercely jousting in the court of public opinion			2
monday 's report only increased the war of words			0
cardinal @entity123 , an @entity124 and head of the @entity2 's supreme court , said the report " lacks a solid foundation in the sacred scriptures			1
" other conservatives called it a " betrayal			0
" opinion : 3 ways the @entity4 should embrace gay rights @entity136 @entity4 and gay activists , on the other hand , heralded monday 's statement and said that some conservative pushback was probably inevitable , given how hostile some corners of the church are to change			1
" i actually do n't think this is as much of a backtrack as we usually see ! " said @entity143 , head of the gay rights group @entity144			0
" i think that response to this report was swift and intense , and i 'm sure many bishops want to be sure people are n't reading more into it than is there , " she continued			0
" however , it is undeniable that there has never been any @entity157 document that made positive , respectful statements about same - sex relationships , so that is an undeniable breakthrough			0
" @entity161 , executive director of @entity162 , echoed that sentiment			0
" regardless of the fact that this is a working document , it is still significant in that it reveals a strong current of affirmative attitudes at high levels in the church towards lesbians and gay people , " he said .			1
