@entity0 -- @entity2 faces another water - logged day wednesday with renewed threats of flash flooding , especially in @entity6			1
the @entity7 is forecasting rainfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour , which could prompt flooding in the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , and along the @entity15 coastal plains			1
on tuesday , storm - weary @entity16 slogged through another day of record - breaking snow , rain and flooding from a series of storms that prompted an emergency declaration from the state 's governor			1
gov. @entity26 's proclamation covers @entity27 , @entity15 , @entity28 , @entity11 , @entity29 and @entity31 counties in southern @entity2			1
the declaration warns that the forecast calls for " extraordinary and continuing rainfall " that is likely to cause more flooding and landslides in the region and authorizes state assistance to local authorities			1
the five - day rain total has topped 10 inches in many areas , with much heavier amounts in some locales			1
more than 21 inches has fallen on @entity44 in @entity11 , with @entity45 receiving nearly 20 inches			1
in @entity15 , authorities were on the scene after a mudslide affecting homes in the @entity53 area , the county 's @entity46 said on @entity54			1
rescues were needed , and evacuations were underway , according to the @entity46			2
in @entity57 , meanwhile , authorities ordered the evacuation of more than 230 homes in two neighborhoods out of fear of debris flows			1
of the 232 homes ordered evacuated in the @entity66 and @entity67 areas , however , only one family evacuated , said @entity68 , spokeswoman for the @entity69			1
the area is a concern because it is below an area burned in the 2009 station fire			2
fires burn vegetation holding the soil in place , leaving the soil more likely to dislodge after heavy rains			2
one resident wary of the potential for mudslides was @entity83 of @entity66 who lost her home last year when a 10 - foot wall of mud came barreling down a hillside			2
she just moved back in october			2
" here we go again , " she told @entity1 affiliate @entity89			2
but this time , the city has bolted down protective concrete barriers and attached them to each other in the area in an effort to guard against mudslides			2
@entity83 said the barriers were not bolted down or attached last year			2
" had they done that , our house would have at least been saved , " she told @entity89			2
streets in downtown @entity103 were closed wednesday because of extensive flooding , @entity89 reported			1
in southwestern @entity108 , a dam that authorities had feared was in imminent danger of giving way to floodwaters was found to be in stronger condition than previously believed , said @entity112 , a spokesman for @entity113			1
the roughly 800 residents of the towns of @entity116 and @entity117 were allowed to return to their homes tuesday night , @entity112 said			1
engineers will monitor the dam , located on the @entity121 , and conduct more tests wednesday , when high water flows are expected again , he said			2
@entity108 gov. @entity124 said he was prepared to declare a state of emergency in the south , where floodwaters also washed out at least one bridge			1
but as of tuesday afternoon , @entity108 officials said the required benchmarks for an emergency declaration had not been reached , and @entity124 had n't received a request from local authorities to issue one			1
" we are closely monitoring the activity in southern @entity108 , and praying for the safety of all of the area 's residents , " @entity124 said in a statement from his office			1
flash flood warnings were also in effect for western @entity143			2
in @entity2 , where the car is king , a record number of motorists called their local auto club to report dead batteries , a need for emergency tows and crashed vehicles , said spokesman @entity153 of the @entity154			2
more than 25,000 distraught motorists made calls for help on monday , the largest number ever in a 24 - hour period for the @entity162 's largest @entity161 affiliate , @entity153 said			2
" we 're in @entity2 , and we do n't have a lot of experience driving in the rain , and some people drive through high puddles not realizing what kind of effect it can have on a car , " @entity153 said			2
" if the engine gets splashed and gets wet , it can stop the car right there			2
" @entity153 said @entity162 was " able to serve the majority of members in 30 minutes , " although he added , " i 'm sure there were a number of people who had to wait longer than that			2
" monday 's call volume surpassed the prior record of about 22,000 on october 9 , 2008 , when a heat wave and the scorching @entity12 winds disabled many automobiles , @entity153 said			2
monday 's weather -- torrential rains -- had opposite conditions , he said			0
" batteries are fickle things if they 're not at full strength , " @entity153 said			0
" hot weather can affect them and weather like this			0
" in the southern @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 were effectively shut down monday and tuesday because flooding , mudslides and rockslides closed the two roads into the parks , said @entity205 , assistant general manager of @entity206 in @entity198			1
in fact , the 102 - room lodge was vacant tuesday after the last couple of guests departed monday , @entity207 said			1
" well , we 're all up here , " @entity207 said of the hotel staff			0
" we would be open if the road is open			0
it 's gorgeous right now			0
up here , it finally turned to snow			0
" but the rain at lower elevations washed out the two roads , she said			1
@entity223 , 39 , who lives in the @entity225 community of @entity226 , @entity2 , said monsoon conditions have inundated the arid landscape			0
fire stations are even offering sandbags to residents who want to shore up defenses to their homes , said @entity223 , who is also a @entity1 ireporter			1
" it 's been raining from two days ago and it just has not stopped			0
they closed a lot of the roads down , " said @entity223 , a mother and college student			1
" it 's pretty bad now			0
we have a riverbed in back of our house , and two days ago it was completely bone dry			0
and then within two days the riverbed is completely full			0
" in @entity15 , @entity2 , four hikers whose truck was stranded by floodwater between two canyon roads were airlifted out tuesday morning and were reported to be doing well , @entity1 affiliate @entity246 reported			1
the four had been stranded overnight			0
five other people were rescued in the same area monday evening , the station said			0
a bulldozer was used to help get them to safety , it said			0
elsewhere , 40 horses were rescued from @entity28 as water rose to heights of about 4 feet , affiliate @entity258 reported			1
the storm is actually a series of storms originating in the @entity265 , known as the " @entity266 " because of their origin near the @entity269			0
they have brought heavy snow to the higher elevations , with torrential rainfall in lower spots , and high winds			0
total rainfall has approached 10 inches in some areas			0
numerous roads were closed because of mudslides or flooding			1
and as much as 13 feet of snow had fallen in the @entity197 as of tuesday , according to @entity1 meteorologist @entity282			0
" we get a lot of snow here , but not usually this much in a 24 - hour period , " said @entity283 , who is visiting family in @entity285 , @entity2			1
the area has received about 9 feet of snow , she said monday			0
" the decks have a good 5 feet of snow on them , " she said			0
one area of the neighborhood was also flooded , she said			0
in @entity298 , @entity2 , near @entity299 , @entity297 washed away land near one home			0
@entity303 , who lives there , said he and his family were told to evacuate , @entity1 affiliate @entity302 reported			1
flooding washed out several roads near @entity299 and @entity298 , the station reported			1
high winds also whipped much of the state , particularly at high elevations			0
peak wind gusts reached 152 mph in @entity314 summit in northern @entity2 , the weather service reported			1
mudslides forced officials to close a portion of @entity318 , also known as the @entity319 , in @entity320 from just north of the @entity57 line to @entity322 , according to the @entity323			1
the @entity319 was also closed north of @entity325 due to flooding			0
a mudslide also closed a portion of @entity318 41 in @entity29			1
a stretch of @entity318 34 in the @entity322 area was closed because of flooding			0
the danger of mudslides will probably intensify , @entity1 meteorologist @entity332 said			0
" a serious situation will develop now with the mudslide danger that will continue over the next several days , " @entity332 said monday			1
another danger : falling trees			0
@entity339 of @entity15 told @entity89 he is heartsick after his vintage 1970 @entity341 truck was crushed by a large tree monday night			1
" it was my baby , " he said			0
@entity339 said he was inside his home and heard the wood cracking and popping as the tree fell			0
" i just knew it , " he said			0
still , many southern @entity16 were not deterred from holiday shopping by the rain , although the rain - slicked roads had led to thousands of accidents			1
