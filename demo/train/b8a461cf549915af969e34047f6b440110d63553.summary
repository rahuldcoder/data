-- last week , a @entity2 district judge dealt a serious blow to @entity4 and @entity5 by slapping an injunction on the @entity8 phone and the @entity9 in a patent infringement lawsuit			1
although judge @entity11 has n't found @entity5 guilty of patent infringement -- not yet , anyway -- she ruled that @entity13 would suffer irreparable harm if the two @entity16 devices were found to infringe @entity13 patents and remained on sale during the trial			1
time.com : per @entity13 request , judge orders @entity5 to halg @entity24 tablet sales the @entity8 is @entity4 's lead @entity16 device , so @entity26 's ruling is the biggest patent setback for @entity16 to date			1
( @entity5 has appealed @entity26 's ruling			2
) i 'm not a lawyer or a shareholder in any of the companies involved , so i 'm less concerned with the legal maneuvering than i am with the patent wars ' effects on consumers			0
let 's take a look at what the injunctions and the greater mobile patent wars mean for the people who are actually using the products : are existing users affected ? if you own a @entity8 or @entity9 , no one 's going to show up at your doorstep and ask for it back			1
your device will continue to work , but there 's always a chance that @entity4 or @entity5 may tweak their software in future updates to work around claims of patent infringement			1
my @entity56 , for instance , lost its " overscroll bounce " effect in an update late last year , and i suspect this was done to avoid a patent claim that @entity13 has wielded against other companies			2
time.com : going @entity16 : an experiment the patents at issue in the @entity5 case deal with universal search , predictive text , slide - to - unlock and the ability to select an action when you tap on certain types of text			2
it 's not yet clear whether @entity4 and @entity5 can come up with workarounds			1
can you still buy a @entity8 or @entity9 ? i ca n't find the original @entity9 online , aside from a few refurbished units , but the device is now a year old and not worth buying			2
i 'm guessing most retailers had already stopped selling it			0
instead , you can get the tab 2 10.1 , which remains on sale at @entity86 and elsewhere			0
the unlocked @entity8 remains on sale on @entity4 's website , but we 'll see what happens once @entity13 posts a $ 96 million bond that 's required to set the ban in motion			1
( if @entity5 prevails at trial , it will get that bond money to make up for lost sales			2
) a @entity98 store clerk , meanwhile , told @entity100 's @entity99 that the carrier will sell its remaining @entity8 stock , but ca n't import any more units			0
time.com : @entity106 court orders @entity13 to pay $ 60 million to settle @entity108 name dispute are all @entity16 devices now doomed ? aside from @entity5 , @entity13 has also sued @entity110 and @entity111 for patent infringement			1
the @entity113 found @entity111 guilty of infringing two patents , and its latest phones were briefly held up at customs in may while the company 's workarounds were approved			0
@entity13 claims that the workaround is n't good enough , so @entity111 's not out of the woods yet , but at the moment @entity111 's @entity16 phones are widely available			1
@entity110 also seems safe for the moment , following @entity126 judge @entity125 's decision to dismiss the entire case of @entity13 v. @entity110			0
@entity125 said neither side could prove damages , and @entity13 could n't show that an injunction would benefit itself more than it would hurt @entity110			0
@entity13 will most likely appeal the ruling			0
are @entity13 products at risk ? of course , @entity13 's rivals have filed counter-suits			1
the problem for @entity5 and @entity110 is that they 're relying on " standard - essential " patents that are required for telecommunications , and must be licensed on fair , reasonable and non-discriminatory terms			0
the @entity140 is currently investigating @entity110 , which is suing both @entity13 and @entity141 , over its use of these standard - essential patents to score injunctions			0
if the @entity140 requires @entity110 to license its patents , the company will lose its ability to get @entity13 products banned			0
this article originally appeared on @entity0 : @entity13 wins ban on two @entity16 devices : what it means for you			2

@entity4 and @entity5 will halt sales of the @entity8 phone and the @entity9 .
the companies were dealt an injunction on sales *due* to @entity13 's patent claims .
current owners will continue to be able to use the devices .
@entity13 's sued other @entity16 producers for patent infringement , but the jury 's still out .
