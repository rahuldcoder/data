@entity0 , @entity1 -- five years ago , @entity3 lost his 14 - year - old daughter , @entity4 , when a drunken driver hit her and two of her friends as they walked down a sidewalk near her home			1
but he refused to let her tragic death become just another statistic			0
knowing that the driver was 20 years old -- not even old enough to drink legally -- @entity3 made an unusual promise to the teenagers attending @entity4 's memorial service in @entity0 , @entity1			1
" if you stick with me for four years , " he said during her eulogy , " do n't use alcohol , do n't use illicit drugs but give back to your community , work with your parents and talk to your parents , i 'll be there with a bunch of other people to give you money			2
" @entity3 has lived up to his end of the bargain			1
along with @entity31 and @entity32 , the fathers of @entity4 's two friends who survived the accident , @entity3 has given $ 1,000 scholarships to more than 140 high - school graduates who have taken @entity38			1
" i wanted to give them encouragement and to tell them that ... you can be better and always be greater in the situation , " said @entity3 , whose nonprofit raises the money through private donations			1
@entity4 's @entity38 is simple			1
teens can go online and sign a pledge to not drink until they are 21 and not get into a car with someone who has been drinking			2
toward the end of their senior year , if they have not been convicted of underage possession of alcohol , they are eligible to submit a scholarship application , which includes a 300 - word essay explaining how @entity38 has affected their life			1
recipients are selected by @entity3 , @entity31 and @entity62 based on the essay and an interview			1
" @entity38 stands for integrity , character and honesty and living a life of simple self - respect , " said @entity3 , 52			2
the message is something that is sorely needed in @entity0 , he said , one of a few places in the country where people can drink in public			0
" @entity0 has an apathetic attitude in some ways to underage drinking , " @entity3 said			1
" and it has a somewhat acceptance of drinking and driving			0
" the city 's drinking culture dates back to its history as a major mining town in the late 1800s , when it attracted boatloads of @entity90 seeking better opportunities and a new life			2
miners often went as deep as one mile underground to dig iron ore			0
it was tough work , and many of them often liked to drink at the end of the day			0
" this town has such a hard history of living , " @entity3 said			2
" it 's a humbling town ... a town of integrity and character			2
but @entity0 allows certain things to continue , and drinking underage and drinking and driving is a situation that 's continued			2
it has to be acknowledged , and it has to be stopped			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity115 it 's not just @entity0 , however , that is struggling with the problem			1
nationwide , @entity1 routinely ranks in the top five per capita for drunken - driving fatalities			1
those troublesome statistics , along with @entity4 's story and other high - profile deaths , have led legislators to seek more aggressive ways to address the issue			1
one example is the @entity128 , which has been implemented in 16 counties , including @entity0 's , since last year			2
it requires anyone arrested for a second drunken - driving charge to submit to two alcohol breath tests daily			2
" @entity1 finally has had enough , " said @entity134 , the state 's attorney general			1
" tired of opening the newspaper , reading about somebody getting their sixth or seventh dui			0
we 're addressing it both through law enforcement , through legislation and through awareness			0
" one of the great things about @entity4 's @entity38 is changing people 's behavior and the positive awareness of it			1
" @entity151 , a recent scholarship recipient , says she has noticed the culture starting to change in @entity0			0
" people are coming up with alternatives , " she said			0
" i know of a group of kids that got everyone together and said , ' just bring soda			0
we 're going to have pizza and music			0
do n't bring any alcohol			2
' ... it 's changing gradually , in little steps			0
" @entity165 , one of 42 students to receive a scholarship this year , said @entity4 's story inspired him to do something with his life other than just drink and party it up			1
he works two jobs , plays sports and plans to attend @entity175 this fall			0
" i kind of looked around and saw a lot of people i knew -- a lot of friends , for that matter -- just going down that path , and i never wanted to , " he said			0
" it never appealed to me			0
" @entity4 's @entity38 started in @entity0 , but it has expanded over the years to other parts of @entity1 as well as four other states : @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			1
about 8,000 young people have accepted the challenge			0
but they 're not the only ones			0
" i have parents taking @entity38			0
i have grandmothers taking @entity38 , not because they have a drinking problem or anything else like that , but they understand what it 's about , " @entity3 said			1
" they have the opportunity and the sage advice of looking back to people and looking at their future and their grandkids and saying , ' hey , i 'm the first one to acknowledge i 've done some goofy stuff			0
but you know what , @entity4 's @entity38 is a great way for you to enjoy life ... to be something , to be somebody unique			1
' " for him , seeing kids make responsible choices means @entity4 's memory will live on			1
" @entity4 is forever 14 , " @entity3 said			1
" i ca n't get her back , but i can help other parents keep their kids safe			0
" we save one child , we save a generation , and that makes me encouraged to continue what we 're doing every day			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity4 's @entity38 website at www.mariahschallenge.com and see how to help .			1
