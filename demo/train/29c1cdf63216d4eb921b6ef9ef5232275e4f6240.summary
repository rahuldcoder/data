-- early one morning the sun was shining and she was lying in bed , wondering why he had her cash and if her hair was still red			2
an idea for a song bubbled , and she was n't sure if this one should be about heartbreak , revenge or the old get - into - the - groove thing			2
and then -- light bulb ! -- why not multitask it ? that was her therapy , after all			2
failure ? not an option			2
resistance to her will ? futile			2
the husband who was no longer there ? well , it was nice sometimes to imagine his head popping like a melon			0
till death and all that			0
now -- where did she put her phone ? yup , " @entity31 " is our lady 's divorce album			1
seven out of 16 songs address her split directly , and that 's low - balling if you think the chick with " fake t * * * and a nasty mood " in " @entity39 " could be the lingerie model who became @entity43 's new baby mama			1
revealing herself has always been part of her art , and this is hardly her first album that 's dark , messy and conflicted			1
but " @entity31 " stands as @entity50 's most explicit work			1
only who would have expected her to be this explicit with her ... feelings ? how explicit ? " @entity53 , ex-wife / this is your life			1
" " i tried to be your wife / diminished myself , i swallowed my light			0
" " lawyers / suck it up / did n't have a prenup			0
" " every man that walks through that door will be compared to you for evermore			0
" she 's been personal , but never this detailed before			1
in part , it 's an old punk - rock impulse : show the world no one can hurt you more than you hurt yourself			1
except she has cross-wired exposure and pain , which gives this set of confessions their discomforting immediacy			0
as the beats swirl , @entity50 pursues release , vows to rise above and wishes things had turned out differently			1
she also sings about new love ( fits like a glove ) , and asks for someone to lick the frosting off her cake on " @entity85			0
" the music chases the latest articulations of club - land ecstasy , but often returns to the blend of synth - driven electro and @entity91 - pop classicism she 's staked out since " @entity93			1
" back after a 12 - year layoff is @entity95 , who handles the most pained tracks ( including " @entity97 , " which b * tch - slaps @entity43 's shoot - ' em - up aesthetic with a nod to " @entity100 " )			2
new in town is @entity102 , the @entity103 producer behind the cheerleader fantasy of " @entity105 ' " who is forced to curb his love of @entity108 , in service of sounding like @entity95			0
handling the big dance - floor tracks are @entity112 duo @entity111 and @entity113 , who put the empty boom of the club into songs like " @entity117			0
" hooks emerge quickly ; there 's lots of naughtiness for the dj to bring back , and the music has depth that rewards repeated listening			2
the first impression is a desperation most people will mistake for @entity50 's old impulse for commercial connection			1
that 's never far away , but this is something far more personal			1
there 's something remarkable about @entity50 's decision to share her suffering the way she once shared her pleasure			1
her music has always been about liberation from oppression , but for the first time the oppression is internal : loss and sadness			0
stars -- they really are just like us			0
