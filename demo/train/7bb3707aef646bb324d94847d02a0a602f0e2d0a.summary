-- the primary joy of a bicycle is that , in its purest form , it 's little more than a highly efficient way of walking			1
just grab the bike , climb aboard and pedal swiftly to the shop , the bar or wherever			2
some cyclists , however , prefer their rides a bit more dramatic			1
perhaps even scenic , remote and arduous			0
here 's a selection of fantastic rides from around the world that take anything from a day to several months to complete			1
do n't forget the anti-chafe cream			0
the @entity19 ( @entity20 ) whether or not the 800 kilometers ( 500 miles ) between the @entity22 city of @entity23 and the @entity25 border is the planet 's most beautiful ride depends on your idea enjoyment of sometimes bleak high - altitude vistas			1
what 's in little doubt is that it 's the highest			2
the route includes three road passes of more than 5,000 meters ( 16,400 feet ) , with a lung - bursting maximum of 5,220 meters over the @entity38 mountain pass , where the reward on a clear day is a distant view of @entity41			1
this , it goes without saying , is n't for everyone			0
conditions can be testing and the distance between towns necessitates careful planning			0
plus , the sensitive political situation in @entity50 means individual travel can be tricky at times			0
for the sufficiently committed this remains one of the globe 's true adventures , from the religious and cultural wonders of @entity23 and @entity58 to the prayer flag - draped peak of the @entity62 mountain pass , with the vast , turquoise lake , @entity64 , shining in the valley below			1
if that 's not enough , the route ends with possibly the world 's longest descent , a precipitous 3,500 - meter drop off the edge of the @entity22 plateau along muddy hairpins			1
@entity74 ( @entity75 ) @entity76 but arguably no less arduous than the @entity19 is this 270 - kilometer off - road ride across @entity75			1
from the @entity79 to @entity81 coasts , this one takes in mud paths , rainforest , coffee plantations , even an extinct volcano			2
it can be completed in three days each november as part of the annual mountain bike race from which the ride takes its name			1
those in less of a rush can spend as long as they like , whenever they like , tracing the route of the 16th - century @entity97 conqueror @entity98 , the chief conquistador of the title			1
@entity75 has a vast range of natural wonder packed into an area roughly the size of @entity104 , around a quarter of it national park -- @entity107 delivers a decent taste of this			2
beginning in the surf resort of @entity112 , the route soon turns onto energy - sapping red mud dirt roads , climbing up			1
and up and up -- the official @entity107 course includes about 3,000 meters ( 9,842 feet ) of climbing on the first day alone			1
skirting the capital , @entity117 , it passes near the extinct peak volcanic peak of @entity119 and down again to mangrove forests and white sand beaches			0
the traditional end to the trip is a dip in the @entity81			0
@entity125 ( @entity126 ) the @entity125 , which also goes by the slightly less evocative name of @entity128 , is a @entity130 's nightmare -- an @entity132 - funded epic across eight countries that claims to be the longest signposted cycle route in the world			1
covering almost 6,000 kilometers ( 3,728 miles ) , it runs from the northern edge of @entity138 's @entity137 along the coasts of @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , the @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			1
it hopefully goes without saying that there 's no need for anyone to attempt the whole thing			2
inevitably , it also goes without saying that a surprising number of people do , mainly over a series of summers -- this is a route where the warmest spot is probably somewhere near @entity158 on the coast of @entity142 , so it 's really not one for winter			1
the more intrepid riders fill the official @entity125 website with arcane tips about acquiring krone when crossing into @entity145 and the best way to get themselves and their bikes over the sea crossings			2
the @entity168 ( @entity169 ) at a shade more than 64 kilometers ( 40 miles ) this is perhaps the only route on this list on which riders could reasonably consider taking their kids the full length without worrying about a visit from social services			1
completely separated from the road , it snakes across a series of small , wonderfully scenic islands in @entity183 prefecture , in the west of the country			0
@entity169 might be more popularly associated with the car rather than the bike , but cycling is common here and the @entity168 shows how two and four wheels can happily coexist			1
the segregated cycleway , which also has a lane for pedestrians , for the most part runs alongside the road , though there are diversions , not least the longer , more gentle and thus more leg - friendly slopes up to the high road bridges			2
bikes can be hired at a series of points along the path			0
some people complete the trip in a day , but many dawdle to gaze at the beautiful vistas along the @entity207			2
this is a route for gentle meandering , not teeth - gritted grinding			1
yes , there are tolls on the bridges for cyclists , but these are pretty small , more necessitating a pocket of change than a bank loan			0
@entity218 ( @entity219 ) want big ? this is big			0
an off - road touring route from @entity223 's @entity222 all the way to @entity225			1
if the 4,400 - kilometer ( 2,734 miles ) length ( as detailed on the @entity228 website ) is n't enough to start palpitations , how about a combined 61,000 meters ( you do n't even want to know what that is in feet ) of climbing ? yes , that 's right , almost seven times the height of @entity41 -- from sea level , that is , not base camp			1
it 's also often extremely remote , and thus largely the preserve of wiry , wind - burnished men and women on much - traveled mountain bikes towing trailers filled with anti-bear spray , titanium camping spoons and nuclear fusion nano - stoves			1
it 's undeniably spectacular , taking in everything from woodland to mountains ( did we forget to mention the @entity251 ? ) and the wastelands of the @entity253			0
potential companions could include grizzlies , moose , mountain lions and eagles			0
if that 's not enough to think about , weather conditions mean the trip is only really feasible from june to september , and even then flash rains can make sections impassably muddy for weeks at a time			0
@entity265 ( @entity266 ) another epic , and this time in one of the more cutoff places in the world : @entity266			0
at least with the @entity272 the route organizers might actually be on the rider 's side			1
a vastly ambitious , recently completed 960 - plus kilometer ( 596 miles ) off - road route through the forested wilderness -- @entity272 means " path through the forest " in the local indigenous language -- it runs from near the state capital , @entity280 , to @entity281 in the far southwest			1
the less ambitious can tackle smaller , less strenuous sections of just a day or more , and the official website gives updates on sometimes muddy trail conditions			0
anyone planning the full slog would be wise to avoid the full heat of summer , and come prepared			0
that said , between towns there are designated campsites every 30 or so miles , with sleeping huts and water supplies			0
the @entity297 ( @entity298 ) file under " deceptively tricky			0
" this 160 - kilometer route ( 99 miles ) is hardly alpine in outlook , crossing some of the most stereotypically lush and rolling @entity298 countryside you can imagine			2
but all those small ups and down add up			0
riders tackling the entire route commit themselves to almost 4,300 meters ( 14,107 feet ) of uphill pedaling			2
a much tramped walking route for thousands of years and now a fully signposted hiking trail , the @entity297 meanders from the precipitous cliffs of @entity311 to historic @entity312 , virtually all off road and much of it on ancient chalky bridleways			0
open to cyclists , walkers and horse riders , those on two wheels generally allow two or three days for the trip , and there are plenty of absurdly picturesque villages en route with pubs and guesthouses			1
some hardy souls tackle the entire thing in a day , but there 's an argument that pedaling furiously through some of @entity298 's most glorious vistas kind of misses the point			2
know about an amazing cycle route that 's not on this list ? tell us below			2
@entity336 is a journalist based in the @entity140 who regularly contributes to cycling publications			0
he once rode a bike most of the way from @entity340 to @entity341			0
@entity0 's series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

@entity20 's @entity19 takes cyclists 800 lung - bursting kilometers through *foothills* of @entity41
more *relaxing* rides are available -- @entity169 's @entity168 can easily be completed in a day
riders might have bear or moose for company on the @entity362 bike route from @entity222 , @entity223 to @entity225
