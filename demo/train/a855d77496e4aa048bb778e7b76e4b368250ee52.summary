it would be an understatement to say that @entity2 is under attack			2
this week , the @entity2 @entity4 bypassed all security checks at the country 's largest airport in southern port city of @entity9			1
a few hours earlier , another affiliate of the @entity2 @entity4 massacred nearly 30 members of @entity2 's minority @entity13 community in @entity15 province			1
a few hours after the @entity9 airport was reclaimed by @entity2 's security agencies , a suicide bomber rammed a truck into a military checkpoint in @entity21 , close to the @entity23 border , killing at least three soldiers			1
the attack on @entity9 's international airport resulted in the deaths of 29 people , including security personnel			2
the bodies of another seven cargo workers were recovered tuesday from a cold storage facility at the airport			0
all 10 terrorists died during the assault			0
even after those attacks , for the second time in two days , @entity2 's largest and busiest airport was forced to shut down after militants launched a brazen attack on airport security forces			1
tuesday 's assault targeted the @entity45 academy near @entity9 's @entity46 , the airport 's manager told @entity48 's @entity47 in @entity9			2
the attackers fled , and no one was killed in the attack , officials said			0
the obvious question is : how did the militants manage to enter the airport premises with heavy arms and ammunition ? major security lapses this security lapse however is not new			1
in 2009 , militants breached an otherwise impregnable fortress -- the @entity62 of the @entity63 in @entity64 -- and continued their operation for hours			0
similarly , the @entity2 @entity4 also attacked @entity9 's naval base in 2011 , destroying expensive equipment and killing 10 soldiers			1
in 2012 , they were also successful in carrying out suicide attacks at @entity71 's international airport , resulting in more loss of life			0
despite these major lapses , @entity2 's system of intelligence gathering and sharing has been reformed			1
the new internal security policy , agreed in december 2013 , aims to centralize the intelligence sharing process , but it is yet to be implemented			0
in the case of the @entity9 airport attack , the military 's swift response helped salvage the situation			1
within five to seven hours the airport had been cleared and , given the high - value targets there , major damage was prevented			0
military seizes initiative another key feature of the operation was the decisive role of the military , as the civilian government apparently took a backseat			0
under @entity2 's constitution , federal ministries are responsible for aviation and airport administration , but the ministers were nowhere to be seen			1
even in terms of media management , the military seized the initiative as the head of inter services public relations ( @entity110 ) , a major general , was live tweeting and informing about the progress of the operations			0
in any other country this would not seem extraordinary			0
but , given @entity2 's peculiar history and the recent civil - military tensions , these developments were meaningful			1
there was a clear public message that the @entity63 was at the forefront and in control of security policy and operations			0
negotiations with the @entity127 in the weeks before the attack , @entity2 's civil and military branches of government had been struggling to find a way out to deal with the @entity127			1
formal talks with the @entity127 commenced in february 2014 but these disintegrated a fortnight ago			0
concurrently , the military had been launching airstrikes and the @entity9 attack came in the midst of policy shift in @entity138			0
the airstrikes resumed after the airport attack was foiled			2
since @entity2 's new army chief @entity142 assumed charge in november 2013 , the military has given clear signals of its intent to tackle the @entity127 militarily			1
the @entity127 is believed to have killed between 5,000 and 15,000 @entity2 soldiers including generals in recent years			1
@entity2 's @entity63 did not suffer such losses in three wars against @entity150 ( 1965 , 1971 and 1999 )			1
civilian leaders are worried about the potential backlash of such military operations			0
what complicates the issue further is that some of the factions of @entity127 are in league with the ( @entity2 - friendly ) @entity23 @entity4 , and an all - out operation would hit them as well			1
the @entity2 @entity4 are not in a position to take over the country			2
however , the three terror incidents in the past 48 hours underscore their capacity to launch attacks on multiple fronts			2
they gained media attention and reminded everyone of their cohesion , weeks after reports that the @entity127 was in disarray after a major faction split from the group in may			1
is the @entity127 in crisis or cohesive ? in its official statement accepting the responsibility for this attack , @entity127 cited the @entity9 attack as a revenge for the martyrdom of its leader @entity182 , who was killed in a @entity184 drone strike last year			2
since then the @entity127 -- a loose umbrella of various militant groups -- has been in a crisis of sorts			0
its leader @entity189 reportedly operates from @entity23 and , according to @entity2 official sources , gets support from the @entity23 authorities			0
for the latter , @entity189 's presence is a lever to get even with @entity2 for its purported support to the @entity23 @entity4 , who launch frequent attacks and are contenders for the power pie after @entity202 's drawdown in 2014			1
it is unclear if the recent attacks will lead to the emergence of a coherent policy and civil - military consensus in @entity2			1
civilians are afraid of the reprisal attacks ; and the military is in no mood to allow @entity127 to continue killing its soldiers			2
and with the withdrawal of foreign troops , soon the neighboring @entity23 may turn into an easier space for @entity2 @entity4 and their affiliates			2
it is time for @entity2 to make a hard choice			0
in its strategic calculus , it needs to address mending relations with the @entity23 government and viewing terrorism as a shared problem .			0

airport attack was not @entity2 's first security lapse
military has taken the lead in *responding* to the strike
@entity2 's government has struggled to negotiate with @entity4
@entity127 used recent terror incidents to show cohesion , despite major faction split
