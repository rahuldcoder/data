-- its name is @entity3 , and it has traveled a long way to tell you about its home : @entity7			1
this meteorite , discovered in northern africa , contains preserved materials from the @entity7 that are 4.4 billion years old , say scientists in a new study published in the journal @entity14			1
@entity3 , they say , may be the first identified example of crust from ancient @entity7 , and its age suggests that the planet 's crust formed within the first 100 million years of @entity7 ' existence			1
" it 's just pressing its nose against the creation of @entity7 , " lead study author @entity21 , a professor at @entity22 , said of the meteorite			1
what 's more , the rock contains 10 to 30 times more water than any previous @entity7 meteorite , suggesting it was derived from a water - rich environment , said @entity33 professor @entity32 , who was not involved in the nature research , but separately studies @entity3			1
it is unlike any other @entity7 meteorite ever found , he said			1
" if i were going to start looking ( for evidence of past @entity7 life ) , this would be the first place i would go , to this meteorite , because it is a sample from the surface , " @entity32 said			1
it 's really old , older than we thought @entity3 contains zircon crystal grains that are 4.4 billion years old , according to the new study			1
that 's only about 100 million years after the solar system 's first dust condensed			2
" since it takes time to build up a crust , and to allow that crust to process itself until it can start growing zircons , it 's pretty amazing that we have such ancient zircon , " @entity21 said			0
what 's more , said @entity21 , the oldest crusts of the @entity60 and moon formed at around the same time			0
although scientists have found zircons that are almost that old on @entity60 , only one -- discovered in @entity65 -- is around the same age			1
but five zircons in this @entity7 meteorite alone -- some of the first zircons to come to @entity60 from @entity7 -- seem to date to 4.4 billion years old			1
" a very large portion of the @entity7 crust must be very ancient , " @entity21 said			1
@entity21 's sample of @entity3 , officially called @entity73 7533 , is about the size of a fist , but all pieces of the meteorite together total about 1.5 kilograms ( 3.3 pounds )			2
@entity60 sees a lot of meteorites generally ; about 100 tons of rocks come in from space every day , said @entity82 , manager of the @entity83 at @entity85 's @entity84			0
but rarely do we find @entity7 rocks			1
less than 100 have been found , @entity21 said			2
a large meteor impact on @entity7 , about 5 to 11 million years ago , was enough to eject material from the crust and into space in the form of this meteorite , @entity32 said			1
cosmic ray exposure measurements suggest it was floating in space for all this time			0
@entity3 had initially been described in a @entity97 study published in february , led by @entity32 , which dated it to about 2.1 billion years old			1
but since then , @entity21 and colleagues found the rock contains materials that are 4.4 billion years old , and published their new findings this week			1
@entity32 said his group has independently confirmed @entity21 's results regarding the age			0
what accounts for this discrepancy ? @entity32 said his first result may have been for the bulk rock -- that is , an average age of all of the rock types embedded within it			0
it 's likely that the earliest formation of the meteorite was at 4.4 billion years , @entity32 said , but it continued to be shaped by geological processes for another 2 billion years before it blasted off into space			1
@entity32 and @entity21 continue working on different @entity3 samples separately , but not as rivals , said @entity32			0
in fact , they are good friends			0
" two labs working completely independently coming up with similar conclusions is much more convincing than if you 're all part of the same gang , " @entity32 said			0
different than other meteorites @entity85 's most powerful and sophisticated rover on @entity7 , the 2 - ton @entity129 , has given plenty of insight into the planet 's former habitability since it landed there last year			1
but even it can not do a great job of dating rocks			0
on @entity60 , scientists can better estimate ages because they can measure the amount of trace elements in rocks , not just the most common elements			2
the trace elements -- those that are present in tiny quantities in a particular sample -- can be more indicative of the processes that led to the formation of meteorites than common elements , @entity21 said			0
the trace element iridium , present in this meteorite , indicates that it came from a mysterious area of @entity7 called the southern highlands			1
that makes @entity3 the first known resident of the southern highlands to get to @entity60			0
other samples from @entity7 that have reached @entity60 have been coming from the @entity157 , which has low , flat plains			2
the @entity160 , by contrast , has a lot of craters , @entity32 said , meaning it 's about 3.8 billion years old or older			1
given its newly confirmed age , @entity3 is one of the oldest samples scientists have seen from @entity7			1
the other possible contender for that title is the famous @entity171 meteorite , which has been dated to a similar time frame			2
@entity85 announced in 1996 that the @entity171 meteorite , discovered in @entity174 , contained evidence of primitive life , but that conclusion has since been disputed			2
@entity32 noted futher that the @entity171 sample is a chunk of bedrock , and would not have interacted with water and the surface environment the way that @entity3 did			2
in the meantime , scientists are also probing @entity3 for ancient @entity7 fossils			1
so far none have turned up , @entity32 said , but there could still be chemical byproducts of primitive life hidden in the rock samples			2
clues to @entity7 history @entity7 had a lot of volcanic activity when @entity3 's zircons formed 4.4 billion years ago , @entity21 said			1
volcanic processes would have released water , carbon dioxide and nitrogen , which were trapped inside the interior of @entity7 , creating a " a very quick , thick atmosphere , perhaps even an ocean on the surface			1
" in other words , we 're talking about " very livable conditions " at that time , @entity21 said			0
" if there was a biosphere on @entity7 ever , this is the time it would have originated , " he said			2
unfortunately for whatever life may have existed then , these processes happened very early in the history of @entity7			1
the planet then underwent heavy bombardment by asteroids and comets , forming the craters in the southern highlands and knocking the atmosphere and oceans off the planet			0
on @entity60 , a biosphere emerged after our own planet was bombarded , and took advantage of abundant sunlight			0
the cold , dry conditions at the surface of @entity7 today are so hostile that nothing could survive , @entity21 said			2
but @entity3 may hold clues to what might have lived early in the planet 's history			0
" we will be looking inside this rock for evidence of early micro-organisms that may have left behind chemical traces , " he said			1
how it got to scientists recovered pieces of the meteorite , found in 2011 , are now the subjects of intensive study			1
but they did n't just crash - land on scientists ' desks			2
a thriving business has emerged in @entity251 among nomads who wander the @entity253 collecting fossils and other interesting rocks and sell them			0
that 's how @entity3 first got to a dealer , who sold it to a private collector in @entity260 , who then gave it to @entity32 to look at			0
the rock sat on @entity32 's bookshelf for two months			0
he was n't even sure that it was a meteorite			0
finally , he decided to cut into it and see what it was			0
" it was shiny black on the outside , and when i cut into it , it was still very black , but it had also white specks and sparkling specks , and it looked really different than anything i 'd ever seen , " @entity32 said			0
the @entity279 dealer who bought it from nomads called the meteorite " @entity3 , " a name that has stuck among scientists working on it , @entity32 said			2
once the word got out that @entity3 was from @entity7 , the nomads scoured for more pieces of the meteorite , some of which ended up with @entity21			1
any meteorite buff who sees @entity3 would be " struck by its odd beauty , " @entity32 said			0
" it is just a gorgeous sample , " he said			0
" it 's so different			0
i always say to everybody , ' it 's my favorite meteorite of all time			0
' " as scientific investigations continue , researchers may find even more reasons to praise @entity3			0
