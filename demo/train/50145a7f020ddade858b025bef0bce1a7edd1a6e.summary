@entity0 -- after weeks of @entity3 and @entity4 bombardment , about one - third of @entity6 's ground armor has been destroyed , as well as most of the fixed air defense sites and aircraft , but a stalemate between government and rebel forces is emerging and could last for some time , according to a senior @entity3 official with direct knowledge of the latest military assessments			1
the official agreed to speak monday only on background because of the sensitive nature of the information			0
the official said the latest @entity3 and @entity4 view is that both sides essentially remain in their fixed positions -- the rebels near @entity25 and the pro-government forces near @entity27			2
rebels say no to @entity30 - brokered deal " neither side has the wherewithal to move , " the official said			2
rebels do not have the manpower , vehicles or weapons to make major advances			0
and while @entity6 's forces continue their attacks , especially in @entity41 , the source said they are suffering from a lack of supplies , ammunition and fuel because of airstrikes			1
the official said that a major ground force movement would put @entity6 's units in the cross hairs of @entity4 airstrikes			1
airstrikes have rebels clinging to hope that said , the official acknowledged strongly that the onslaught by @entity6 forces in @entity41 has put people there in a dire situation			2
the official described a military scenario in which the @entity3 and @entity4 have direct knowledge of civilians being killed but have been unable to act because @entity6 forces and armor are so mixed with civilian populations , it 's become impossible to launch airstrikes against them			1
the @entity3 and @entity4 also think that @entity6 's forces still have as many as 15,000 shoulder - fired anti-aircraft missiles , which has resulted in limited use of ac - 130 aircraft , which are vulnerable to being shot down as they fly low and slow to engage in the type of precision airstrikes needed in a place like @entity41			1
the attacks also have affected @entity6 's ability to communicate with his commanders			1
he is still having face - to - face meetings with key associates , the official said , but is largely unable to communicate directly with units in the field			0
there are still some fiber - optic communications capabilities as well as communications nodes in schools and mosques that are very difficult to strike			0
report tracks " sweeping changes " in @entity89 on the other side , another senior @entity3 official who is familiar with administration contacts with the opposition said the opposition 's leadership seems to be sincere and earnest about its aim of toppling @entity6 , but the leaders are not as organized as they need to be			1
they lack a detailed plan			2
@entity103 military forces and their abilities are " still a bit of a mystery , " the officials said			0
" ... their resources are limited and their strategies and tactics are hard to fathom			0
" while they are holding on to @entity25 for the moment , the senior official said it is hard to imagine them making any further gains toward @entity116			0
@entity1 's @entity117 contributed to this report .			0
