-- twelve - year - old @entity1 knows every street before he sets foot in a city			2
it 's not because he 's visited before			1
it 's because he 's autistic and has an uncanny ability to memorize maps			1
" he 's actually a big help when traveling , " jokes his mother , @entity10 , founder of women 's travel blog @entity11 and the @entity14 , a community of travel writers and bloggers			1
@entity1 's other son , 10 - year - old son @entity18 , has used a wheelchair since surgery to remove a spinal tumor left him paralyzed from the waist down			1
@entity1 always has to make extra phone calls to ensure there 's an accessible subway or hotel room , but that has n't stopped her from vacationing with her sons all over the world			1
while she mostly travels for work , @entity1 says taking @entity1 on trips since he was diagnosed with autism at age 2Â½ helped him not get " rutted into routine			2
" some autistic children ca n't stand to have their schedules disrupted , she explained			1
" by [ traveling ] consistently over time , he 's developed ways to cope with being outside his routine , " she said			1
to help comfort @entity1 , @entity1 created games -- like hunting to find his pajamas -- that he plays in every new place he visits			2
traveling with children is difficult , but when children have wheelchairs or communication problems , it can be overwhelming for parents to plan even a weekend getaway			1
" you can not pick up and go like everyone else does			2
you have to plan your trip very carefully , " says @entity55 , executive coordinator of the @entity56			2
about 2.9 million youths ages 17 and younger have a disability , according to the 2009 @entity61			0
even if it requires extra planning , @entity55 says , it 's important for children with disabilities -- whether they 're blind , deaf , autistic or use a wheelchair -- to " get out of the house and travel like any other child			1
" @entity70 , founder of @entity71 , a site that offers travel tips for disabled people , suggests that families " start small			1
" " it does n't have to be the big trip to @entity78 , " she said			0
for families that have n't traveled before , @entity70 suggests driving to a nearby city and trying a hotel stay			0
in 1990 , the @entity82 required that hotels provide accessible amenities			0
but when booking a room , @entity70 says to be specific about your needs			0
" do n't just ask if the room is accessible , because it means so many things to so many people , " she said			0
it 's ok to ask questions and request for a certain bed height or shower chair , she added			1
during trips , @entity70 has persuaded hotel managers to get rid of their shower chairs without supportive backs in favor of ones that people with balance issues , like her daughter @entity103 , can use			0
@entity103 , 18 , uses a wheelchair because she has spina bifida , a condition that prevents the spinal cord from developing			0
she has traveled all over the country as a wheelchair athlete and is the national powerlifting champion for her weight class			0
though @entity103 's mother plans ahead by making phone calls and researching accessible options online , the two have had their fair share of travel hiccups			1
the list includes being stuck in the rain at a rental car facility without an accessible shuttle and being stranded in excruciating heat when a @entity125 trolley car was too crowded to fit her daughter 's wheelchair			2
regardless of the amount of planning , parents ca n't predict a broken subway elevator or an unexpected flight of stairs			2
" i 'm always having to be five steps ahead of the game and thinking what we 're going to need			0
and then , when it does n't work out , it becomes really frustrating , " @entity70 said			0
overcoming the intimidation of taking a trip is the biggest obstacle , @entity1 says			0
but once parents get over the learning curve of knowing where to go and how to get from point a to point b , traveling with a disabled child becomes second nature			1
" over the years , i 've developed this sixth sense about which entrance is more likely to have a ramp or certain places that may be able to accommodate even just space between chairs at restaurants , " says @entity1 , who has taken her sons to @entity153 , @entity154 and several @entity156 countries			0
sometimes , @entity1 has her autistic son , @entity1 , wear a button or t - shirt that says , " i 'm autistic			2
" the message is a friendly reminder to other travelers that her son is n't purposely acting out			0
" you 'd be surprised how somebody can get really irritable because they think your kid is misbehaving , " she said			0
about one in 110 children have an autism spectrum disorder , according to the @entity180			2
though @entity1 says @entity1 looks forward to each excursion , not all autistic children handle new adventures well			1
" there are some kids with autism that love to travel and do really well			1
for others , it can just be more challenging , " said @entity188 , the vice president of family services at @entity190			2
if a child thrives in rigid routines , @entity188 suggests parents tell their child in advance that they will be exploring a new place			1
creating a book with pictures of the travel destination can also help children know what to expect			1
when planning a trip , find out if attractions in the area offer special programs			0
the @entity208 in @entity209 , @entity210 , has @entity211 several times a year			0
the program allows families with autistic children to explore the hands - on museum , which includes simulating scenarios such as visiting a doctor 's office , buying fruit at a market and ordering food at a diner			1
autistic children who struggle with daily activities benefit from the museum , said @entity226 , director of sales and marketing			1
" the more they can practice in a safe environment , the better they are in the real world because it 's not new to them , " she said			2
parents who do n't want to navigate cities may enjoy cruises that have accessible pools and programs just for kids			1
@entity55 pointed out that many ships allow parents and their disabled children to attend youth activities together			1
the all - time best place to travel with a disabled child ? the @entity248 , mothers and travel experts say			1
" @entity249 is the nirvana , " @entity70 says			1
" we usually go to @entity249 and almost forget that there 's any issue			1
" @entity249 provides @entity254 for anyone with a disability			1
guests can use the cards to wait in separate lines for rides , and up to five members may go on the attraction with the cardholder			0
@entity1 recently took her kids to @entity249 and said the pass allowed her family to get through the lines " exponentially faster			1
" she said her son loved the graffiti - style signs with a wheelchair symbol because they were geared toward kids			2
" he felt so accepted , " she said			0
@entity249 also permits a family member to test a ride -- without waiting in line twice -- to gauge how a disabled child may react before he or she gets on			1
in case rides or crowds are too loud , @entity1 brings along ear plugs so @entity1 can block the noise			0
@entity282 is one of the most accessible cities in the country , according to @entity55			0
besides accessible museums and public transportation , organizations are spearheading efforts to make theater productions more accessible			0
in june , the @entity291 in the @entity292 kicked off the @entity293 , which aims to make @entity294 shows more enjoyable for the deaf and the blind			0
at no charge , hearing impaired theatergoers may use @entity299 , a handheld device that displays dialogue , lyrics and show announcements			0
visually impaired patrons may use @entity304 , an audio device that relates all visual elements of a show , including choreography , lighting , sets and costumes			0
the goal is to " open up @entity294 to an audience who has historically not been reached out to , " said @entity313 , executive director of @entity291 for inclusion in the @entity292			0
families that prefer outdoor recreation do n't have to stay at home either			0
almost all national parks have accessible hiking trails or activities like kayaking			0
some state parks -- in states such as @entity325 , @entity326 and @entity327 -- have accessible cabins that include kitchens with low counters , showers that fit wheelchairs and hospital beds with lifts			0
" @entity335 allows kids to see the world in a positive light , but planning a dream vacation is n't going to be simple , " @entity70 said			1
" especially when they 're disabled , you want them to have a good experience , so it 's a lot of pressure , " she said			1
but by not staying in the protection of their own home , @entity70 says , she and @entity103 are showing able - bodied people what they can change at hotels , restaurants and attractions to make life a little easier on others			0
" it 's one thing to have a law that says you have to do this , " she said			2
" it 's a whole other thing to see somebody experience the struggle and then want to help them			2

vacationing with disabled children may be challenging , but parents say it 's worth the effort
@entity335 may help autistic children break up rigid routines
@entity249 provides *incredible* service to disabled kids , moms and travel experts say
