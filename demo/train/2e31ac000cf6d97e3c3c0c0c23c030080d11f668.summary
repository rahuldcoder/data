" wow ! i totally just watched the awesome cell phone video you shot at that concert ! " said nobody ever			1
yet , at some point , we 've all done it			1
the band is on stage			1
the phone is in your pocket			1
and , lest you actually just dance and enjoy yourself and maybe scan the floor for dropped cash , you decide , instead , to shoot three minutes of unlistenable pixel puke			1
perhaps you upload the blurry mess to @entity17 or @entity18 , but in the end , it ultimately just gets filed deep within your camera roll with the pointless images of some overpriced , mediocre meal you ate from a trendy new food truck			1
for , at the time , that , too , seemed worth documenting			1
" look , @entity25 ! @entity30 - @entity29 - @entity28 - @entity27 fusion ! " it 's difficult to explain just why we do it -- why having a very basic camera in our pocket compels us to shoot photos and videos of live music that , deep down , we know we 'll never look at			1
part of it might be the delusional notion of preserving a memory , but it 's probably more about showing everyone in social media that you 're actually out of your house doing something culturally important			1
as opposed to staying in and slathering your body with ranch dressing			1
once again , i believe i 've shared too much			1
but for exploring your city and having a true , cultural experience , live music counts			1
going to @entity58 does n't			1
otherwise , we 'd all be tweeting arrogant selfies next to lumber			2
" must be nice to be @entity62			2
" of course , cell phones annoyingly blocking your view at concerts is nothing new , and even complaining about them ( like i am here ) has grown rather clich√©			1
yet , it seems to be getting worse			2
so , recently , the indie rock band the @entity73 decided to try something			1
they posted a sign : " please do not watch the show through a screen on your smart device / camera			2
put that s --- away as a courtesy to the person behind you and to @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
much love and many thanks ! @entity73 " this all came out a couple of weeks ago when a picture of their sign from @entity98 's @entity97 was tweeted by @entity99 , and it quickly got passed around the @entity100			1
the band 's sentiments seemed to strike a nerve			1
but never mind the annoyance of having to look at the stage through a sea of bright , glaring viewfinders			2
even more than that , it 's all just become sort of sad			2
we 're disconnected from the music			1
the real eye - opener for me was last year , when i saw @entity114 perform " @entity115			2
and planes falling from the sky			2
it was complete sensory overload , and when i got home , i decided my life needed more lasers			2
i considered attaching some to my dog			2
in fact , i 'm still thinking about it			0
" @entity115 " was simply amazing			0
yet , so many people missed the entire show			0
and they were literally right there			0
amidst all the operatic madness of the classic @entity137 double album , everywhere i looked , people were watching it through 3 inches of glass on their phones			0
one of the greatest rock spectacles ever was directly in front of them , yet they actually made the conscious decision to have a worse visual experience			0
if " @entity115 " was fine dining , it would be like ordering a beautiful steak and then asking the server to put it down his pants for five minutes			0
" look , just run around the building a few times , do some burpees and bring it back			0
" but , for all those people at the @entity114 show , i guess it just seemed like the right thing to do at the time			0
however , i assure you it was n't			0
so , as an experiment , i want you to pick up your phone , scroll through your photos and videos , and stop when you get to something you shot at a concert			1
then ask yourself this : did i actually pay to see @entity171 ? and if the answer is yes , go jump into a river			0
otherwise , take a moment and really think about that photo			0
was it worth annoying everyone else behind you ? has it made your life better ? will you ever look at it again ? if you 've answered " yes " to any of these questions , please join the @entity171 fans somewhere downstream			1
your services are no longer needed			0
interestingly , though , on a positive note , last weekend i went to @entity189 in @entity190 , @entity191 , for a weekend of @entity192 and @entity193 and several other bands that rule your face			0
deep within the trees among the masses of people , getting a cell phone signal strong enough to utilize the interwebs was next to impossible			1
which may explain why i saw so few people actually using their phones to begin with			0
and as the night sky darkened , i was struck by the absence of little glowing viewfinders			0
people were just enjoying the music			0
part of that is a reflection of the overall music - first vibe at @entity189 , but it still proves that it 's entirely possible to be a part of the live music experience without having to document it in some way			0
of course , if you have a quality camera and can get up close , there 's definitely an art in concert photography			1
and people certainly appreciate that			0
but for everyone else , let 's all agree to give it a rest			0
just experience the music , take it in , and we 'll talk about our favorite moments over late - night food			0
i know a great place for @entity30 - @entity29 - @entity28 - @entity27 fusion .			0
