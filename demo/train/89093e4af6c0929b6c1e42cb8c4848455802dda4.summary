-- president @entity1 confidently declared that his administration will get things done in @entity4 despite an atmosphere he described as divided and politically dysfunctional			1
speaking at a press conference 100 days into his second term , @entity1 fielded a range of questions on topics including @entity11 and the @entity13 attack , and he defended his administration 's actions and positions			1
noting that lawmakers have blocked initiatives like averting forced budget cuts and expanding gun control , one questioner asked if @entity1 still had " the juice " to get his agenda through @entity24			1
" i think it 's a little , as @entity27 said , you know , ' rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point , " @entity1 said at the @entity25			1
" we understand that we 're a divided government right now			2
in the @entity39 , this habit of requiring 60 votes for even the most modest piece of legislation has gummed up the works there			2
and i think it comes to no surprise , not even to the @entity45 people , but even members of @entity24 themselves that right now things are pretty dysfunctional up on @entity48 , " @entity1 said			1
the president said he is confident that a range of priorities will get done , like immigration reform			1
he praised the bipartisan work on that bill			2
" that 's going to be historic achievement , " @entity1 said			1
" i 've been very complimentary of the efforts of both @entity33 and @entity58 in those efforts			2
" overhauling immigration policy @entity1 said an immigration reform bill proposed by the so - called " @entity63 " senators meets criteria that he believes is necessary			1
this includes more effective border security , a crackdown on employers " gaming the system , " making the legal immigration system work more effectively , and making sure there is a pathway to citizenship for immigrants already in the country			2
@entity1 said he has n't seen what @entity25 members are proposing and promised to be open - minded about whether they can address the issue better			1
but , he added , " the bottom line is they still have to meet those basic criteria			2
" forced budget cuts as for the sweeping $ 85 billion in forced spending cuts that took effect in march due to congressional inaction on deficit reduction , @entity1 said the austerity is " damaging our economy " and " hurting our people			1
" he said lifting them will require compromise			2
" i 've had some good conversations with @entity33 senators so far			0
i think there 's a genuine desire on many of their parts to move past not only sequester , but @entity4 dysfunction			1
whether we can get it done or not , you know , we 'll see			0
" @entity105 suspends furloughs @entity1 said short - term fixes , such as legislation heading for his desk aimed at ending sequester - related air traffic control furloughs blamed for widespread flight delays last week , are n't enough			1
he said that if " they are seriously concerned about passenger convenience and safety , they should not just be thinking about tomorrow			0
... they should be thinking about five years form now , 10 years from now , 20 years from now			0
" @entity1 said both parties must " sit down " and commit themselves to reduce " our deficit sensibly " and ensure investment in infrastructure , education and basic research that will help the economy and the country grow			1
" that 's what the @entity45 people want , " he said			1
budget - cut layoffs deal a blow to investigations of gun - related crimes partisan politics @entity1 said he believes lawmakers understand the need for compromise and " common sense solutions			1
" but he noted that it 's a challenge to get republicans to embrace them			2
" i can urge them to			0
i can put pressure on them			0
i can , you know , rally the @entity45 people around those -- you know , those commonsense solutions			0
but ultimately they , themselves , are going to have to say we want to do the right thing , " he said			0
" i think there are members , certainly in the @entity39 right now , and i suspect members in the @entity25 as well who -- who understand that deep down			0
but they 're worried about their politics			0
their base thinks that compromise with me is somehow a betrayal			0
they 're worried about primaries			0
and i understand all that			0
" @entity166 asked about the hunger strikes at the @entity168 , @entity169 , detention facility , @entity1 said he continues to believe it should be closed , repeating a stance he took when he became president in 2009			1
" i think it is critical for us to understand that @entity166 is not necessary to keep @entity45 safe			1
it hurts us , in terms of our international standing			0
it lessens cooperation with our allies on counter-terrorism efforts			0
it is a recruitment tool for extremists			0
it needs to be closed , " he said			2
for the past decade , the @entity166 detention center has held people captured outside the @entity45 in counterterrorism operations			1
there are about 166 detainees at the facility , according to the latest figures , with half participating in hunger strikes over complaints about their treatment			0
@entity1 said @entity24 would not allow the facility to be closed but he promised to press the issue again			1
" despite the fact that there are a number of the folks who are currently in @entity166 , who the courts have said could be returned to their country of origin or potentially a third country , i 'm gon na go back at this			1
i 've asked my team to review everything that 's currently being done in @entity166 , everything that we can do administratively , and i 'm gon na reengage with @entity24 to try to make the case that this is not something that 's in the best interest of the @entity45 people , " he said			1
proud of @entity220 's @entity219 @entity1 also said he spoke to @entity219 , the @entity220 player who on monday became the first member of a major @entity45 pro-sports team to come out as gay			1
" i told him i could n't be prouder			0
you know , one of the extraordinary measures of progress that we 've seen in this country has been the recognition that the lgbt community deserves full equality , not just partial equality , not just tolerance , but a recognition that they 're fully a part of the @entity45 family , " he said			0
" and , you know , given the importance of sports in our society for an individual who -- who 's excelled at the highest levels in one of the major sports go ahead and say , ' this is who i am			2
' i 'm proud of it			0
i 'm still a great competitor			0
i 'm still seven - foot tall and can bang with @entity251			2
" " and , " he said , " deliver a hard foul			0

@entity1 took a wide range of questions from *reporters*
" rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point "
president still wants @entity166 closed , says will reengage @entity24
@entity220 's @entity219 gets presidential a high - five
