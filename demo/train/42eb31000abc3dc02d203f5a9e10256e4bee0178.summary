@entity0 , @entity1 -- in @entity0 , the arid heartland of @entity1 's indigenous @entity6 population , a quiet oil boom is gaining momentum , one drop at a time			1
argan oil , crushed from the seeds of the short , spiky argan tree , has been used for centuries as a medicine and staple ingredient in local cooking -- drizzled on salads and couscous or mixed with almonds and honey to make amlou , a dip for bread			1
but now the oil is generating buzz as a high - end commodity in the lucrative global cosmetics market			2
@entity31 in vitamin e and essential fatty acids , it 's believed to help all sorts of skin conditions -- including acne , psoriasis and age - related wrinkles			2
argan trees , which are well adapted to drought and other extreme weather conditions , are endemic to the southwestern part of @entity1 around @entity0			2
as such , the rise in demand has turned @entity0 -- famed for its beautiful beaches and laid - back culture -- into a hive of small - scale worker co-ops , each dedicated to squeezing oil from the notoriously hard - shelled argan nut			1
traditionally , it was uncommon for @entity6 women to work outside the home			1
but times have changed , and according to the @entity55 , all the co-operatives are now staffed and run by local women			2
" when we started in ' 96 we had got only 16 women who believed in our project			2
most of them were divorced or without a husband , " said @entity60 , a university professor who helped found one of the first cooperatives in the region			2
ethnic berbers -- the indigenous inhabitants of @entity68 whose culture predominated in the region prior to the 7th century @entity71 invasion -- were among @entity1 's earliest inhabitants , and government figures show that at least one third of the country 's population of 32 million speak a @entity6 dialect			1
however , according to the @entity79 , @entity1 's berbers also face habitual cultural discrimination			0
it was only last year that the state finally recognized @entity6 , the @entity6 language , as an official language alongside @entity85			1
@entity60 says that the new - found international popularity of argan oil -- which she describes as " liquid gold " -- has not only provided about 5,000 jobs for @entity6 women across 170 co-ops , but also an important social lifeline			1
" we 've started relying on ourselves , " said @entity93 , a co-op worker			0
" now , we can provide for our children on our own			0
" argan oil has n't just improved the region 's economic and social standing , @entity60 says it 's played a vital role sustaining its ecology too			1
" the purpose of this work is to preserve the argan tree , because it was in decline , " she said			1
indeed , 30 years ago , extensive deforestation left the tree on the brink of extinction			1
today , @entity109 has designated the 26,000 square - kilometer @entity111 - growing region as a " biosphere reserve			1
" besides the @entity111 tree 's various human uses , @entity109 notes , it has had an historical role as a buffer against northern expansion of the @entity120 desert			1
@entity60 says it 's for all these reasons that 60,000 new trees are now planted each year			0
the co-op women certainly have their work cut out			0
it takes about 20 hours to produce just one liter by hand			0
first they use jagged stones to crack the shells			0
they then place the kernels between two rocks , grinding them into a brown , peanut butter - like paste			0
this is then kneaded to extract the oil , leaving a solid block that is sent off to a mechanical press where even more oil can be extracted			0
to match the pace of global demand , however , many of these processes have become mechanized			0
but as yet , there is no machine that can do a better job at cracking open the argan nuts than the women			1
for now at least , the work is steady			0
" i am very happy , " said @entity60			0
" economically , ( because ) the price is increasing ; socially , because the women can get outside the house and learn ; and environmentally , because we can plant these trees			0
