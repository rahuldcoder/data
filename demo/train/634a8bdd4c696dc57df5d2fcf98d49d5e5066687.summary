even by @entity2 ' brutal standards , the video is horrific			1
twenty - one @entity4 beheaded on a beach in @entity7			2
@entity8 across the world expressed horror and outrage at the mass killing , with @entity13 calling the victims " martyrs " whose violent deaths should unite the fractured @entity18 community			1
remarkably , though , a leading @entity18 bishop says that he has already forgiven the @entity2 soldiers who slaughtered his fellow @entity4			1
@entity21 , head of the @entity18 in the @entity22 , was in @entity23 on friday for the swearing - in of the @entity25 ' new ambassador - at - large for religious freedom , @entity28			1
@entity21 spoke to @entity3 about why @entity2 targets @entity4 , and why he forgives them , even as he rejects their horrific acts			1
q : what was the first thing that came to your mind when you heard about @entity2 killing the @entity4 ? a : i suppose i had a sense of the inevitable happening			1
we knew that it was going to happen by the way @entity2 was sending out information about the captives , parading them on video			1
it was all very orchestrated			2
it was shocking to see how that could happen today in the 21st century			2
but we also saw strength and bravery in those men , and the number of messages and calls we 've received in solidarity , the condolences and support has been overwhelming			2
this crime is not just a crime against @entity4			2
it is a crime against humanity , and if there 's anything we should stand for as human beings , first and foremost it 's the sanctity of all human life			2
q : not long after the video released , you tweeted about the killings , using the hashtag # @entity69			0
did you mean that you forgive @entity2 ? a : yes			1
it may seem unbelievable to some of your readers , but as a @entity18 and a @entity18 minister i have a responsibility to myself and to others to guide them down this path of forgiveness			1
we do n't forgive the act because the act is heinous			0
but we do forgive the killers from the depths of our hearts			0
otherwise , we would become consumed by anger and hatred			0
it becomes a spiral of violence that has no place in this world			1
q : you and many others had publicly prayed for @entity2 to release the @entity4 and yet they were killed in a brutal manner			1
how do you maintain faith in @entity99 or in prayer after such a horrific outcome ? a : i learned a long time ago that when one prays , one prays for the best outcome , not knowing what that outcome would be			0
of course , i prayed that they would be safe			0
but i also prayed that , when the moment came , they would have the peace and strength to be able to get through it			0
it does n't change my view of @entity99 that these 21 men died in this way			2
they were sacrificed , but so much has come out of it			0
they brought the imminent dangers to marginalized peoples , not just @entity8 , but @entity120 and others in the @entity122 , to the attention of the whole world			1
q : this is not the first time @entity2 had targeted @entity4			1
why do you think that is ? a : they made accusations in the video that @entity133 crusaders were forcing women to convert to @entity135 , which is totally unfounded and untrue			0
@entity4 were not part of the original crusades and are not part of any crusade now			0
we have lived peacefully and never taken up arms or forcibly converted anyone			0
but violent acts need to be justified and this is the justification they found			0
q : you 're in @entity23 today meeting with @entity25 leaders			0
what should they do about @entity2 ' persecution of @entity8 and other religious communities ? a : i would like to see us all start to work towards human rights generally , because when we 're divided into different departments or organizations any change will be fragmented			1
if you look at the rights of every individual , @entity99 - given rights , we can all start to work together and safeguard any people who are persecuted anywhere			0
of course , the vast majority of persecution falls squarely right now on @entity167 and that needs to be addressed			0
but , as a @entity18 , i will never be comfortable just safeguarding the rights of @entity8			1
we need to help everyone .			0
