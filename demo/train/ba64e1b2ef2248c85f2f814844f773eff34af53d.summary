-- despite headlines saying that it lost tuesday 's vote , the fate of @entity3 's proposed $ 1 - a - pack tax hike on cigarettes is still in limbo , and state officials said late thursday that a final result is likely weeks away			1
the tax increase , known as @entity12 , would raise an estimated $ 735 million a year , with roughly three - quarters of that money going to cancer research			1
initial results showed @entity16 29 being rejected by a margin of roughly 65,000 votes , out of nearly 4 million cast -- a margin of 50.8 % to 49.2 %			2
however , the results do n't yet include a vast number of mail - in ballots and provisional ballots			0
as of thursday night , at least 829,863 votes were yet to be counted , according to figures posted by @entity3 's secretary of state			1
the real figure is likely much higher , as the official " uncounted " number leaves out several counties that have yet to send their data			0
" we 've asked counties to report their number of unprocessed ballots , but it 's voluntary , so there 's no way to know the exact number , " said @entity33 , a spokeswoman for the secretary of state 's office			2
state law requires county elections officials to report final vote tallies by july 6			1
@entity3 secretary of state @entity47 then has until july 13 to certify the results			2
as more results trickled in by thursday night , the margin had shrunk to less than 53,000 votes			1
or as one @entity53 joked , " @entity12 29 results are close enough to make you want to chain smoke			2
" " supporters of @entity16 are not conceding defeat , " vowed @entity57 , ceo of the @entity60 - founded @entity59 organization			0
" we will closely monitor the counting of late absentee and provisional ballots ... this race is still too close to call , and we remain hopeful that the victory will ultimately be ours			0
" @entity12 29 was the subject of a fierce advertising campaign , playing out on @entity3 ' television screens for weeks ahead of the vote			1
opponents of the tax spent nearly $ 47 million , most of it coming from tobacco companies			0
they argued that @entity16 would create a large , unaccountable bureaucracy			0
supporters , including @entity59 , the @entity78 , the @entity79 and @entity81 mayor @entity80 , spent about $ 12 million .			0
