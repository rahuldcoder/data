-- @entity2 's new captain @entity1 admits that he will have to earn the respect of the nation 's cricket fans after being confirmed as the successor to @entity7 on wednesday			1
the 36 - year - old @entity7 stood down as skipper of @entity2 's test and one - day teams on tuesday following last week 's @entity12 quarterfinal exit , but will continue as a batsman after being named in the 14 - man squad to tour @entity15 next month			1
@entity1 has long been groomed as @entity7 's successor , having filled in when his captain was unavailable or being rested , but acknowledges that he is not the most popular choice to replace him			1
" i do n't know the exact reasons why it 's there , but it is and i 've had it probably my whole career , " he told the @entity20 website			0
when cricket means more than just a match " so i certainly do n't sit here and think that i can get the whole of this country to like me			0
people are always going to have their own views , but for me it 's about respect			0
" it 's about earning that respect , leading the team in the right way , playing cricket in the right manner and hopefully i can earn the respect of the doubters that are out there			2
" @entity7 was one of the most successful captains in modern cricket , having led @entity2 to victory at the 2003 and 2007 @entity49 before last week 's defeat by @entity51			2
@entity1 , who turns 30 on sunday , said he was happy to have @entity7 in the team for the short trip to @entity15 , which comprises three one - day internationals in @entity55 from april 9 - 13			1
" @entity15 is going to be a great test for that , to see how it all unfolds , " he said			0
" i know he will allow me to do my job to the best of my ability , i have a very good working relationship with ' punter ' and i 'm confident that if he can continue to play as well as he has done for such a long time , i 'm certain it can work			0
