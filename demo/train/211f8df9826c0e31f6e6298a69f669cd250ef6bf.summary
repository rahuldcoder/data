-- a coalition of civil rights organizations has filed a motion in federal court seeking to block an @entity6 law that requires officers to make immigration checks while enforcing other laws if " reasonable suspicion " of illegal immigration exists			1
the so called " show me your papers " provision is perhaps the most controversial aspect of @entity6 's tough immigration law , @entity16			1
the @entity21 @entity20 last month , in response to a challenge by the @entity19 , struck down three provisions of @entity16 , but upheld the police immigration checks			1
the civil rights groups asked the court to block implementation of the law while they make their case that the provision is unconstitutional			1
even though the @entity20 upheld the provision , the civil rights organizations say they are presenting new arguments and new evidence against it			1
in the motion , the organizations argue that the provision in question will result in extended detentions while statuses are being checked , violating the @entity42 protections against unreasonable searches			2
the motion also argues that the provision violates the @entity45 because " racial or national origin discrimination was a motivating factor in its enactment			2
" it also calls for an injunction to another part of @entity16 that makes it a state crime to harbor immigrants who are in the country illegally			0
" in a state that 's more than 30 percent @entity60 , requiring police to act as immigration agents is an invitation to racial profiling on a massive scale , " @entity55 , a senior staff attorney with the @entity57 @entity56 , said in a statement			0
" police chiefs and communities know these laws do n't work , and we hope that the courts will continue to block them from going forward			0
" according to the @entity57 , the new evidence shows that lawmakers who supported @entity16 used false statements and discriminatory language with the intention to impose a statewide practice of racial profiling			1
the motion was made on behalf of plaintiffs in @entity80 v. @entity81 , et al. , a class action lawsuit challenging @entity16 , filed in may 2010			2
in addition to the @entity57 , those presenting the motion include the @entity86 , the @entity87 , and the @entity88			0
earlier this month , federal officials said they had not seen a change in the number of illegal immigration checks sought by local @entity6 police as allowed by the partially upheld law			1
the @entity95 and at least two sheriffs in @entity6 told @entity0 that the law wo n't result in great change for their departments			2
but @entity102 police chief @entity101 expressed concern in an interview after the ruling about whether his 950 - officer agency has been dealt an " impossible mandate			0
" the state law allows citizens to sue his department or others if they fail to enforce federal immigration laws , the chief said			0
" just for my agency , it will be a huge workload , just making the calls and waiting for a response on what to do , " the police chief of @entity6 's second - largest city said			1
" i 'm not sure the federal government is capable of handling all the requests that they will be receiving , " @entity101 added			0
" i do n't know what effect it will have on my agency			0
