( @entity8 ) -- can chess be transformed into a money - spinning global spectator sport ? it is a question that will be much on @entity14 's mind , as he settles down to watch the opening ceremony of the game 's latest world championship match in @entity18 , southern @entity19 , this thursday			1
an imposing , shaven - headed @entity21 media entrepreneur with an intellectual air , mr @entity14 last year paid @entity23 , the world chess federation , $ 500,000 for exclusive global rights to commercialize the sport over the next decade			1
at one level he seems an unlikely impresario , not least because he cheerfully admits to playing barely any chess himself			1
yet he has a publicist 's gift for the grandiose , describing the game as a " glorious contest of honor and beauty , of human greatness and magnificent theater " -- albeit one that is much in need of a marketing shakeup			0
mr @entity14 plans to infuse chess with the same mix of lucrative sponsorship deals and general razzmatazz that helped the @entity43 to revolutionize international cricket			1
if outwardly tedious sports such as snooker or golf can become mass - market spectacles , he reasons , why not a pastime that @entity23 says is enjoyed by roughly 600m each month ? the difficulties he faces are clear from the contest in @entity18 , which many aficionados say ought to have the makings of a classic			1

on the other is @entity67 , a telegenic @entity68 prodigy , whose floppy blonde hair and handsome features make him something of a sex symbol -- as well as the highest - ranked player in chess history			2
and yet the match remains a hard sell for spectators			0
chess contests are typically lengthy , draws are common , while the finer details of strategy are basically incomprehensible to all but a few experts			2
a taste of mr @entity14 's plans to overcome such problems were on show at a tournament in @entity88 earlier this year , including a system called " @entity90 " where the audience is guided by specially programed tablet computers			1
future tournaments could feature more outlandish ideas , such as biometric bracelets tracking player 's heart rates and perspiration levels -- giving spectators an instant sense of the stresses faced at the board			0
" we have tested a feature with cameras to track eye movement as well , so you can see where they look on the board in real - time , " mr @entity14 says			1
despite his efforts , commercial progress has so far been slow			0
the match in @entity18 boasts just one sponsor , the host state of @entity116 , which handed over @entity117 ( $ 4.7m ) to cover costs and prizes			0
the games will be broadcast live , but only on @entity19 's stodgy government - backed television channel			0
still , mr @entity14 refuses to be downcast			1
" chess tournaments have traditionally been organized by ex-chess players , who are reductionist , and have lost touch with the cinema , the drama of this game , " he says			2
" but in time a revolution is possible			0
if you can persuade millions to watch golf , chess is going to be an easy sell			2
" see also : finding an edge in a crowded market an alien game the complexities of chess are bad enough , but the game faces a further barrier in enticing big - money corporate sponsors : the curious reputation of @entity23 president @entity143 , who has run the sport for nearly 20 years			1
the former @entity146 politician turned businessman is best known for consorting with unsavory dictators -- something that otherwise enthusiastic financial backers might find a little off - putting			0
a friend of former @entity154 leader @entity153 , in 2011 the eccentric millionaire also visited @entity155 during its civil war , playing a chess match with @entity158			2
last year he dropped in on @entity160 's @entity159			0
mr @entity143 is also oddly fond of extraterrestrials : he once claimed to have been abducted by aliens , and has said that chess was first brought to earth by beings from another world			0
" people like [ @entity14 ] @entity14 are right that chess is a massive untapped marketing opportunity , " whispers one grandmaster			1
" but can you really expect serious international companies to sign up to a sport whose top guy thinks their game is a gift from distant planets ? " Â© @entity178 2013			0
