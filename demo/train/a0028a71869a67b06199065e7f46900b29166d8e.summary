@entity0 is in a tough spot			0
it has @entity4 militants threatening the @entity6 border town of @entity7 , inching ever closer to confronting @entity0 security forces			0
in addition thousands of @entity9 , fleeing @entity4 attacks , have massed along its border , adding further to @entity14 's troubles			0
amid mounting pressure to become more active in the @entity17 - led international coalition against @entity4 , the @entity0 parliament last week overwhelmingly authorized its military to make incursions into @entity6 and @entity20 ; also to allow foreign troops to operate out of @entity0 bases			1
the move has been greeted in @entity25 capitals as a welcome sign that @entity0 is finally fully on board with the @entity29 coalition			1
yet the @entity0 parliament 's actions herald neither a complete about - face in policy toward @entity6 nor immediate military action against @entity4			2
indeed , @entity0 's reasons for joining the war may be more to do with suppressing @entity38 separatists and removing the @entity40 regime than with destroying the jihadist group			1
toppling the leadership in @entity43 and keeping in check the @entity9 who are closely linked to the @entity44 , or @entity44 , have long been @entity14 's priorities in @entity6			0
the wording of last week 's parliamentary resolution -- which states that " the terrorist elements of the outlawed @entity44 still exist in northern @entity20 " -- suggests that @entity38 separatists still remain the @entity0 government 's top concern			1
the vote does not signal intervention against @entity4 any time soon : despite thousands of @entity6 @entity38 refugees and @entity4 's fast advance towards @entity0 's southern border , @entity14 seems unwilling to act			1
@entity0 's defense minister @entity56 said : " do n't expect an imminent step after the approval of the authorization request			0
" rather , the @entity0 government is likely to give its full cooperation to the campaign against @entity4 so that it can secure agreement of a @entity17 - backed no - fly zone in @entity6 : this , @entity14 believes , would address both concerns			2
@entity0 thinks that @entity40 regime 's ability to attack mainstream opposition forces from the air has strengthened @entity4 , causing the @entity71 to flee and allowing the @entity73 militants to capture the vacant territory			2
enforcing a no - fly zone over @entity6 would ground @entity40 's air force and boost rebels fighting to topple him : it could also establish a @entity0 military presence , ridding northern @entity6 of @entity38 fighters linked to the @entity44 and smothering the autonomous @entity38 region			1
@entity0 has become increasingly uneasy about the emergence of yet another @entity38 entity on its frontier after the @entity44 - affiliated @entity6 @entity38 groups established autonomy in northern @entity6			1
the military and diplomatic boost that the @entity44 has received through its effective fight against @entity4 has also worsened the situation for @entity14			2
in response to the growing @entity4 threat , the @entity44 , the @entity90 , and the @entity92 's @entity91 ( the @entity44 - linked @entity38 militia group fighting in @entity6 ) , have established a united @entity38 front , with the @entity44 militants coming to the aid of @entity90 fighters and halting the jihadi group 's advance into the autonomous region of northern @entity20			1
the @entity92 's @entity91 was the main force battling @entity4 , and it helped thousands of @entity104 escape from the western part of the region as @entity4 attacked			0
the @entity44 has effectively become the @entity108 's best hope for on - the - ground troops , winning the group positive reviews in @entity25 media			1
since the group started its assault against @entity4 in northern @entity20 , there has been a lot of talk in @entity25 capitals about removing the @entity44 from the terror list			0
the fight against @entity4 has also empowered the @entity44 militarily : @entity0 is concerned that that weapons sent to the @entity90 might ultimately end up in the hands of the @entity44 at a time when @entity14 is moving forward with a deal that would disarm its group			1
the @entity0 government puts the blame for this on the @entity108 but @entity14 's overtures towards its own @entity38 minority have been mostly strained by its own short - sighted @entity6 policy			1
the ongoing conflict around @entity7 has underscored the many challenges the @entity6 war poses for the peace process @entity14 launched in 2012 in an effort to end the 30 - year old @entity38 insurgency			0
the intensified shelling in @entity7 has angered @entity9 on the @entity0 side of the border , who have blamed the @entity0 government for allowing @entity4 to fester and not doing enough to stop its assault against @entity9			0
@entity0 's reluctance to get involved for fear of empowering @entity38 militants in @entity0 is now contributing to the growing discord between @entity9 and the government			2
last week , after reports that @entity0 closed the border gates to impede the flight of @entity9 from @entity7 , @entity149 , the @entity44 's imprisoned leader , warned that if @entity4 carried out a " massacre " in @entity7 then the peace process with the @entity44 could end			1
if engaged by @entity14 , the @entity44 - linked groups in @entity6 could be integrated into the moderate @entity6 opposition and become an effective fighting force against the @entity40 regime			0
but the @entity0 government 's increasingly harsh rhetoric against the group signals that such a shift in @entity14 's thinking is not in the works			0
last week , @entity162 said " while the @entity4 terror organization is causing turmoil in the @entity166 , there has been ongoing @entity44 terror in my country for the last 32 years , and yet the world was never troubled by it			0
why ? because this terror organization did not carry the name ' @entity73			0
' " if @entity0 keeps seeing the @entity44 a bigger threat than @entity4 activities in @entity6 , then the legislation passed last week is unlikely to lead to a deeper involvement of @entity0 in the fight against the jihadist group .			2

@entity178 : @entity0 may be joining the @entity29 coalition to suppress @entity38 separatists
the vote does not signal intervention against @entity4 any time soon , she says
@entity178 : the @entity44 has effectively become the @entity108 's best hope for on - the - ground troops
the fight against @entity4 has also empowered the @entity44 militarily , she *writes*
