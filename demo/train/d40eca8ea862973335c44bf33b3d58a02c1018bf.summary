-- there 's a great song by @entity3 called " @entity4 of @entity5			1
" in it , he sings , " @entity6 gets a lot of chicks			1
" and it 's true			1
@entity14 of ( weird ) women lust for @entity6			1
he 's a bona fide rock star			1
really , that 's why most guys get into playing music in the first place			1
to increase their sex appeal			1
if , say , owning a bagel shop somehow proved to be just as glamorous , right now teenagers would be boiling delicious circles of bread in their parents ' garage			1
but that 's not the case			1
in fact , never in the history of the world has anyone ever said , " make love to me , @entity35			2
they 're just not that into you			2
whereas , when it comes to truly sexy male occupations , the official list seems to top out with musician , athlete , and @entity46			2
but good luck trying to get that job			2
" are you @entity46 ? " " no. " " thanks for coming in			2
we 'll keep your @entity51 © on file			2
" fortunately , though , almost anyone can at least aspire to be a musician , and a new study backs up this seemingly obvious connection between attractiveness and playing an instrument			1
or even just holding one			1
you see , in the study , which was conducted by a professor at the @entity63 in @entity64 and published in the journal " psychology of music , " a 20 - year - old " good looking " man was challenged to ask 300 women for their phone number			1
for 100 of those women , the man carried a guitar case			1
for another 100 , he held a gym bag			2
and for the final third his hands were empty			2
in the end , 54 women out of 300 gave him their number			1
which , even at an 18 % success rate , still seems like a rather impressive return ( and much better than my lifetime batting average of negative - 12 % )			2
maybe it 's time to change my go - to pickup line			2
" so , do you like greyhound racing ? " but let 's get back to those phone numbers			1
in the study , 31 of the 54 -- a vast majority -- were achieved when the subject was carrying a guitar case			1
fourteen women offered up digits while he was holding nothing			1
and only nine were received when the gym bag was used as a prop			0
scientific conclusion : never exercise			0
ultimately , the research suggests that the attraction of a musical instrument is real , as it may indicate physical and intellectual abilities			0
and i totally buy that			0
understanding music is difficult , and someone who knows how to play an instrument usually is also mentally capable of forming complete sentences			0
though , to be fair , i play bass guitar and that tends to rattle the brain			1
i 'm pretty sure actual ideas fall out of my nose in the shower			0
so , generally speaking , holding that guitar case seems to work quite nicely			1
but this female attraction to male musicians should n't be seen as baseless or shallow or ditsy			0
it 's a good thing to appreciate a man with intellectual interests beyond dominating his fantasy football league			0
and it works both ways			0
women with musical instruments also get major sexy points			0
( @entity132 , do you like greyhound racing ? ) of course , one should n't just play music for the sole purpose of appearing more attractive			1
for that , @entity137 invented whiskey			0
instead , the ultimate goal is to play music for the joy of playing music			0
but usually that 's just an evolution over time			0
dreams of stardom often come first			0
hell , i 've wanted to be a rock star since i was a kid			0
sure , there was a short phase where , as a young man , i yearned to be veterinarian			0
however , that quickly went away when , one afternoon , i was allowed to hang out at a local clinic and promptly saw a dog get his testicles cut off			0
" @entity162 , thanks for letting me come by , @entity161 i 'm gon na go home now and rethink my life			0
" so , aside from that momentary lapse of reason , my heart has pretty much always been set on rock stardom			0
but you see how well that 's going			0
i 'm opening a bagel shop .			0
