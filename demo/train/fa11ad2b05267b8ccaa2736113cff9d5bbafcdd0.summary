they 're often called " ambush " killings			1
recent slayings of lawmen -- a @entity7 prison chief , a @entity9 prosecutor , a @entity11 sheriff and a @entity13 cop -- conjure up comparisons to the deadly surprises and have contributed to a disturbing increase this year in law officer killings nationwide , analysts say			1
" when somebody says ' ambush , ' you see a character in a movie and you expect a guy to trip over a line or somebody pop up from a garbage can or somebody has the high ground and shoots on them , " said @entity18 , research director for the @entity19 , whose website tracks slain @entity22 law officers			1
the @entity7 , @entity9 , @entity13 and @entity11 deaths " are kind of like that movie - style ambush , " @entity18 said			1
it 's what many officers fear most , said @entity43 contributor @entity41 , a former @entity44 assistant director			1
" rookie officers are taught generally you 're not concerned about the bullet with your name on it , but about those addressed ' to whom it may concern , ' " @entity41 said , referring to random ambush shootings against police			1
while an ambush often refers to an assailant lying in wait , the @entity44 statistics include " unprovoked attacks " without hiding , which one analyst likened to the circumstances in the @entity9 and @entity13 slayings			1
the @entity44 counted 15 officer deaths by ambush in each year of 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , and said that ambush situations were the biggest category of circumstance behind 543 officers feloniously killed between 2002 to 2011 : 23.2 %			1
the next highest category was an arrest situation , at 22.5 % , according to @entity44 statistics			0
associate of suspected @entity7 killer arrested @entity18 ' group does n't specifically count ambush deaths of officers , but a search of its records with the word " ambush " shows that 14 law officers died in such a manner in the past 12 months -- a figure almost matching the @entity44 's recent data trends			1
the group says that as of friday , the total number of law enforcement fatalities is up 29 % over the same period last year , and the number of gunfire - related fatalities of law officers is up 36 % , @entity18 said			1
there have been 31 officer fatalities in 2013 , and 15 of them are gunfire deaths , @entity18 said			0
the killings in the four states have contributed to that increase , @entity18 said			1
his group , however , does n't include the two prosecutors ' deaths in its counting			2
@entity7 prison chief @entity103 was fatally shot at his home this month after he answered the door bell			1
questions haunt prisons chief slaying case the @entity109 , @entity9 , district attorney and his wife were shot to death in their home last month ; his assistant @entity115 was fatally gunned down in the parking lot of the county courthouse after a very short confrontation in january			1
and rogue @entity120 officer @entity119 threatened to kill police randomly and in fact shot five officers , killing two earlier this year			1
a @entity125 police officer was fatally shot after @entity119 drove up to his vehicle at a stoplight and fired			2
a @entity129 sheriff 's deputy was shot by @entity119 while responding to a report of a vehicle stolen by someone matching @entity119 's description			0
the sheriff of @entity135 , @entity11 , was killed this week after a gunman walked up to the sheriff as he sat in his vehicle in a parking lot near the county courthouse			1
the gunman shot the sheriff in the head and then returned to his vehicle and drove away			0
the @entity44 defines ambush killings into two types			1
one is by " entrapment and premeditation , " which is a scenario " where the officer was lured into danger as the result of conscious consideration and planning			0
these attacks are generally accomplished from cover or hiding ; however , they can occur without cover or hiding , " the agency said			0
there are also ambushes of " unprovoked attacks , " which are " generally accomplished without hiding ; however , they can occur with or without cover , ' the @entity44 said			0
@entity18 , however , questioned the @entity44 definition			0
from the viewpoint of police , what 's considered a routine traffic stop can turn deadly when a motorist suddenly pulls a gun and shoots the officer			2
" unless you 're responding to a scene where someone is shooting , pretty much anything is an ambush , " @entity18 said			2
" there 's countless number of times where an officer stops a car for a traffic violation and then they are shot			0
" but @entity18 acknowledged the ambush circumstances in @entity13 , @entity7 and @entity9 , and noted how the @entity7 killing evoked @entity22 's frontier era of the 1800s when local sheriffs were vulnerable to home attacks			1
" when the public thinks of ambush , it 's when someone calls 911 and there 's somebody waiting on a rooftop			2
that 's unusual , " @entity18 said			0
" they type of incidents in @entity9 and with the @entity7 prison director is even more unusual			1
" when somebody shows up at someone 's home , those are really unusual			0
in these days , you very rarely see that , " @entity18 said			0
" our town is a little more civilized than back in the 1800s			0
" the recent yearly trend of 15 ambush deaths of officers is haunting , @entity18 said			2
" any number above the number zero is high , " @entity18 said			0
" that is a high number			0
to make that decision ever is hard to fathom , but to plan it out in a premeditated matter is troubling			0
" but the overall yearly number of killed officers nationwide is much lower than the 1970s -- an era when violence on police was remarkably high , according to @entity18 and @entity41			2
there were 120 officers killed in 2012 , 176 each in 2011 and 2010 , and 140 in 2009 , @entity18 said			2
those figures compare with 249 in 1971 , 232 in 1972 , 273 in 1973 , and 279 in 1974 , according to the @entity19 website			0
@entity41 recalled the 1970s as an era where public respect toward police was low			2
" with the @entity229 and @entity228 and ' @entity231 ' movies , it was fair game to shoot cops on the street and there was generally a lack of respect for uniformed officers , " @entity41 said			2
" but over the years , the respect has returned and been earned			0
" when respect goes up , the attacks go down , " he added .			0

ambush killings against law officers have occurred in @entity13 , @entity7 , @entity9 , @entity11
they contribute to an overall increase in slain officers so far this year , one group says
many police fear the bullet addressed " to whom it may concern "
but respect toward law officers is much greater than it was in the 70s , expert says
