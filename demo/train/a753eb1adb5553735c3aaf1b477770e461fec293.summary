-- june 2 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : hi , i 'm @entity17 and this is @entity0 ! it 's june 2nd			1
and in our penultimate program of the school year , we 're starting things off on @entity24			0
first up : headlines @entity26 : talking about the stock market , and yesterday was not a good one			1
experts use the @entity29 to get an idea of how the whole market is doing			0
the @entity29 dropped 280 points yesterday			0
that is the worst drop since last august			0
next up today , northern africa , where @entity4 leader @entity36 's forces are fighting against rebels in a civil war			1
other countries are involved in this , too			0
the @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 : they 're part of a military coalition that 's being led by @entity48 , the @entity48			1
the goal of that coalition is to protect @entity4 's civilians during this civil war , and @entity48 says it 's extending that mission for another 90 days			1
a lot of what the coalition 's been doing is carrying out air strikes , like these			1
they 're targeting colonel @entity36 's forces , his compounds , and trying to limit his military resources			1
the conflict in @entity4 has been going on since february			0
recently , several top officials have left @entity36 's government			1
that includes some generals in the @entity4 army			0
one official who left the government yesterday said that it 's in shambles			1
debt ceiling debate @entity26 : turning to the @entity42 government now , where a big topic on @entity76 is the country 's debt ceiling			1
that is the amount of debt that the government is allowed to have			1
president @entity82 wants the ceiling raised			1
@entity84 in @entity85 say they wo n't do that unless the government makes some cuts in spending			0
in fact , on tuesday , the @entity42 @entity90 voted against the idea of raising the debt ceiling without making spending cuts			1
@entity95 is here to help us get a better picture of what 's going on			1
@entity95 , let 's start off with the question , what exactly is the debt ceiling ? ( begin video ) @entity104 , @entity0 @entity105 : it 's basically @entity42 's credit limit			1
@entity85 sets the cap on how much money the country can spend to pay its bills and to pay our interest payments			0
the debt ceiling is sort of like the credit limit on your credit card bill , only much , much bigger			1
and think of it this way : if you 're running a $ 3,000 balance on a $ 10,000 credit limit , the @entity42 government , we run right up to our credit limit over and over again			1
and instead of paying it off , we just raise the debt limit			1
how big is this pile of debt ? $ 14.3 trillion			1
more precisely , $ 14,293,975,000,000			0
this is money the government has already spent			0
stacked on top of each other -- this is just to give you an illustration -- $ 14 trillion would reach from the @entity136 to the moon more than four times			0
your share of this pile of debt : about $ 47,000 for every man , woman and child in @entity42			1
we hit our debt ceiling , the debt limit , on may 16th			1
how are we operating now ? the treasury secretary is juggling the bills that are coming in to keep the country from defaulting			0
he says we can go until august 2nd			0
after that , the situation , he says , is critical			0
secretary @entity151 says not raising the debt limit so @entity42 can pay its bills would be " catastrophic			1
" it 's like being , he says , a homeowner with only enough money to pay some of the bills			1
you either pay the mortgage or you pay the credit card bills			0
which one are you going to pick ? the government would like to pick and choose , would have to pick and choose what to pay			0
@entity151 says some bills wo n't get paid			0
checks to millions of @entity42 , like @entity166 , perhaps , would have to stop			1
@entity84 say he 's wrong			1
the @entity42 wo n't default so long as we keep making interest payments on our bonds			1
all of it , a big political debate now			0
but here you go , you guys : @entity85 has raised the debt ceiling 74 times since 1962 ; 10 times just since 2001			1
this is the first time it 's been so critical politically and turned into such a big ideological fight			1
for more information and complete coverage of the debt ceiling debate , you can check out more at @entity183			1
( @entity184 ) political check @entity26 : thank you , @entity95			0
november 6 , 2012 might sound like a ways away , but some people are working toward something that 's going to happen on that day : the @entity42 presidential election			1
campaign season is here , and before we head off for the summer , we want to give you an idea of where things stand			0
on the @entity198 side , president @entity82 has announced that he 's running for another term in office			1
but whom will he be running against ? that will get decided through primary elections			0
those start happening once we get to 2012 , and several @entity84 have announced their candidacy			1
that includes former ceo and talk show host @entity209 , former @entity42 house speaker @entity210 , @entity42 representative @entity211 and former governors @entity212 and @entity214			1
another name you might know -- former governor @entity217 - is expected to announce his candidacy today			1
some other big names have already said they wo n't be running , and there 's always the possibility that more candidates will join the field			1
@entity224 @entity225 , @entity15 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity228 's social studies classes at @entity229 in @entity230 , @entity231			1
what do these signal flags mean ? you know what to do			0
is it : a ) diver down , @entity237 ) stop immediately , c ) @entity239 warning or @entity240 ) man overboard ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! this double flag is the signal for a hurricane warning			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity249 @entity26 : hurricane season is on ! in the @entity252 , it lasts from june through november			2
that 's not the only time hurricanes can form , it 's just the time when they 're most likely to form			2
forecasters who make predictions about how many hurricanes might form say this year is likely to be an above - average season			0
the @entity260 , or @entity260 , is predicting 12 to 18 named storms			0
it expects six to 10 of those to become hurricanes , with three to six strengthening into major hurricanes			0
last year , zero hurricanes made landfall in the @entity42 , but experts say it 's always important to be prepared			1
@entity269 @entity26 : coming in for a final landing : the space shuttle @entity272 touched down at the @entity5 in @entity273 early wednesday morning			0
it was the shuttle 's 25th and last mission			2
and this is the crew that did it : @entity272 's astronauts , led by shuttle commander @entity281 , who said it was sad to see @entity272 land for the last time			2
as that ship heads into retirement , this is the one that will close out @entity289 's space shuttle program : @entity290 , waiting on the launch pad , scheduled to go up on july 8th in the last shuttle mission			2
profits into @entity293 @entity26 : in @entity6 , @entity7 , there 's a restaurant that works on a kind of " pay it forward " concept			1
when you buy a meal there , you 're also paying to help feed other people who are in need			0
@entity303 looks at the ingredients that make up this unique story			0
( begin video ) @entity307 , @entity0 national correspondent : in busy downtown @entity6 , by lunchtime folks have built up an appetite			0
so at the @entity311 , that 's when the real building begins , because chef @entity314 's goal every day is to help his diners help their community			1
@entity317 , king 's kitchen : and i think everybody wants to help			2
they just do n't know how			0
@entity322 : @entity314 is one of the state 's most renowned chefs and deeply religious			2
so , he opened the @entity311 a year and a half ago as a non-profit restaurant			2
the money made here goes to programs that feed the poor throughout the community			2
last year , $ 50,000			0
mindful of recessionary pitfalls that could derail this effort , the chef started by raising enough donations to open without any loans			0
noble : this is not the best time in the world to get in debt in a restaurant , you know			1
so , we wanted to do this debt - free			2
and what does that say ? @entity322 : the restaurant also offers job training for jobless people , folks such as @entity350 , who joined the program less than two months ago when he heard about it at church			2
@entity354 , king 's kitchen : i 've got more than i 've asked for here			2
@entity359 , finances , everything i needed this place has given me			0
it 's a life - changing place			2
no matter where you are in your life , it will bring something positive to it that was n't there before			0
@entity322 : sure , this non-profit restaurant competes with chef @entity314 's for - profit places , but he has faith there is room for all			1
noble : sometimes in life , you have to make a distinction between success and significance			2
@entity322 : and for him , the significance lies in knowing every plate that goes out of the kitchen here means poor people are being fed all over town			2
@entity303 , @entity0 , @entity6 , @entity7			0
( @entity184 ) before we go @entity26 : before we go , when the weather 's not fit for man nor beast , i guess you could send this out			2
it 's called the @entity396			2
and it 's an all - terrain robot that can run , climb and carry heavy loads			2
it 's also designed to absorb shock			2
the guy 's not being mean ; he 's just showing off the @entity396 's stability			2
it handled the kick all right			0
maybe not quite so stable on the ice			0
someone could invent artificial little creatures that attack the @entity396			0
goodbye @entity26 : i guess you 'd have to call them robo - ticks			0
but that 's a tail for another day			2
just one more show to go			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity17 .			0
