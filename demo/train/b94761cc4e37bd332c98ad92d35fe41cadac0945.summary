-- @entity1 may go down in history as one of most incredible aviation mysteries			1
the cruel reality is that even though we have a fair amount of information now , we still know so little			2
@entity10 prime minister @entity9 informed the families of the victims that the plane had crashed into the remote south @entity14 , and all 239 people onboard are presumed dead			1
that tragic but not unexpected conclusion was based on data analysis by satellite company @entity18 , which @entity10 now says was able to track @entity19 until the signal ended very near where searchers are now hunting for plane wreckage			1
the location tells a lot about what might have happened to the doomed flight while telling us not a single detail about why it crashed			1
the presumed location of the wreckage makes it all but impossible for certain scenarios to have played out as many observers insisted they must have			1
the first thing to understand is altitude is everything			2
a turbofan powered jet like the @entity39 relies on altitude to make good on its ultra long - range capabilities			2
at its normal cruising altitudes from around 35,000 to 40,000 feet , the 777 can fly very long distances , in excess of 11,000 miles			0
but it seldom flies long routes			0
flight 370 search unites global community on its trip from @entity52 to @entity53 , the plane would have had , according to investigators ' projections , around seven hours of total endurance at a normal cruising speed of around 600 mph -- just enough to have flown its suspected flight path north for 40 minutes , west for around that much time again , and then south for many hours			1
at lower altitudes , turbofan engines like the @entity62 engines on the @entity64 airplane , burn substantially more fuel than they do at typical cruise altitudes -- as much as twice depending on the altitudes one uses for comparison			0
the increase in fuel burn will greatly reduce range , making it impossible for @entity1 to have reached the southern @entity14 at a low altitude			0
it would need to have flown at a much higher optimum altitude in order to make it that far			0
pilots can reduce the power to cut back on fuel flow , of course , but that also reduces airspeed , which again reduces range			0
there 's no winning when it comes to flying a turbofan - powered airplane : if you want to fly far , you need to fly high			0
so the fuel required for @entity1 to have reached the presumed crash location around 1500 miles west of @entity93 , @entity94 , means that the airplane did not do a lot of climbing or descending after it deviated from its original planned route to @entity53 while it was still an hour or so north of @entity52			1
so if there was a struggle for control of the flight -- whether it was mechanical issues or a hijacker -- it could not have lasted long or involved great altitude deviations			1
this means it 's hard , though not impossible , to explain the disappearance as being the result of a mechanical or electrical failure			1
such a scenario , as i 've been saying since the beginning of the mystery , would require a kind of mechanical magic bullet , an event that would have taken out the transponder and @entity121 radio , as well as the voice communications radios			2
why else would they not have communicated the emergency ? pilot : how mechanical problem could have downed @entity19 then one must accept that such a failure chain could then allow the crew -- or skilled intruder -- to be able to drive the airplane around the sky for a protracted period of time , eventually pointing it south , in the opposite direction from where the airplane was originally headed			1
let 's remember , too , that the airplane would have to maintain an altitude sufficient to allow it to reach the southern @entity14			0
all this must also have left the 777 in good enough shape to fly for another six hours or so before crashing			0
a failure of the pressurization system might account for the scenario , but only if the pilots completely mismanaged their response to the emergency			1
the 777 's backup and emergency oxygen systems are just as intelligently designed as the rest of the jet 's redundant systems			0
it 's also difficult , if not impossible , to explain how the jet could have made the turns it did if the crew were unconscious during that time			0
were they desperately trying to find an airport before time ran out ? if so , they would have done two things they did n't do : they would have communicated the emergency and they would have descended			0
neither of those things happened			0
while it 's horrific to imagine , a botched hijacking or failed pilot commandeering of the airplane are still the most likely scenarios			1
only when searchers have located and recovered the wreckage , as we all desperately hope they do , will we have our first good clues to what have might have unfolded on @entity179			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

@entity182 : flight 370 may be remembered as one of the biggest aviation mysteries
@entity182 : presumed location of the plane wreckage rules out certain scenarios
he says the best explanation is still a botched hijacking or failed pilot *takeover* of plane
@entity182 : mechanical or electrical failure can not alone account for what we know
