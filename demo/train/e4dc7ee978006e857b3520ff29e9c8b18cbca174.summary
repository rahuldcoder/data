@entity0 -- tuesday is tax day , and the only thing more frustrating than paying taxes is @entity0 's refusal to fix the tax code			1
aside from entitlements , no policy debate highlights the dysfunctions of @entity11 politics more than taxes			2
instead of viewing the tax code as a way to raise revenue and enable government to perform its essential functions , politicians on both sides of the aisle use the tax code -- and the debate about taxes -- as tools to keep themselves in power and to reward their friends and interest groups who put them there			1
first , liberals like to argue that taxing the rich will solve our debt and deficit issues			1
they ignore one major problem			0
there simply are not enough rich people to tax to make a difference			2
for instance , president @entity39 has seized on the so - called @entity41 that calls for higher taxes for " wealthy " @entity11			0
the nonpartisan @entity44 looked at this proposal , however , and found it lacking			0
they wrote , " taking half of the yearly income from every person making between 1 and 10 million dollars would only decrease the nation 's debt by 1 %			0
even taking every last penny from every individual making more than $ 10 million per year would only reduce the nation 's deficit by 12 % and the debt by 2 %			2
there 's simply not enough wealth in the community of the rich to erase this country 's problems by waving some magic tax wand			2
fortunately , the @entity63 voted down the @entity41 monday night			0
yet the @entity63 once again wasted @entity11 's time to make a political point			2
so why do liberals work so hard to create the perception that " taxing the rich " will solve our problems even though the top 10 % of taxpayers already pay 70 % of all federal income taxes and many low - income @entity11 pay no federal taxes at all ? because it 's all about the politicians			1
liberals believe that inflaming class envy will persuade the @entity11 people to elect @entity79 over @entity80 , who allegedly want to protect tax cuts for the rich			1
it would be hard to find a more tired and intellectually dishonest argument in @entity11 politics today than the idea that we can balance the budget by soaking the rich			2
republicans , on the other hand , have desecrated the limited - government legacies of @entity93 , @entity94 , and our founders by embarking on spending orgies with borrowed money -- a form of deferred taxation and financial repression -- while hiding beyond false pledges of tax purity that have made tax reduction and simplification much more difficult to achieve			1
for instance , some @entity80 tax lobbyists , such as @entity108 's @entity107 , say eliminating any credit or deduction -- what economists call " tax expenditures " or " spending the code " -- is a tax increase			1
for instance , when i tried to eliminate a tax earmark for @entity120 movie producers in president @entity39 's stimulus bill , @entity107 alleged that i was trying to raise taxes			0
in other words , @entity107 would demand that @entity80 and conservatives walk away from a deal that was $ 9,000,000,000,000 ( that 's $ 9 trillion ) in budget cuts and $ .01 ( one cent ) in new revenue			1
that 's pure stupidity and , fortunately , no one serving in @entity134 agrees with him			0
i know all the major negotiators on the @entity80 side and , regardless of what their public statements suggest , not a single one would automatically walk away from a deficit reduction deal that included revenue			1
the ideal tax rate is the rate at which government collects enough revenue to perform its essential functions and not a dime more			0
another critically important principle when considering the ideal tax rate is something called " @entity149 , " named after investment economist @entity150 , which shows that over the last six decades tax revenue as a percent of @entity154 has been about 19 % , regardless of fluctuations in tax rates			0
in other words , government has an extremely difficult time collecting more than 19 % or 19.5 % of revenue even if it increases tax rates considerably			0
@entity134 has not tackled fundamental tax reform in more than 25 years			2
in 1986 , president @entity93 signed a comprehensive tax reform plan that closed loopholes , lowered rates , simplified the code , and sustained what was then the longest economic expansion in peacetime since @entity171 called the tax reform act " the best anti-poverty bill , the best pro-family measure and the best job - creation program ever to come out of the @entity134			1
" using @entity93 's approach would be a win - win for taxpayers			1
president @entity39 's own deficit reduction commission , on which i served -- the @entity182 -- followed this template of lowering tax rates and broadening the base by getting rid of spending in the code			1
the commission recommended lowering individual rates to 8 , 14 , 23 % and corporate rates to 26 %			0
i would push rates even lower , but the commission report , which was supported by conservatives and liberals , showed that it is possible to lower rates , stimulate growth , generate additional revenue and reduce the deficit			0
@entity134 has done bold tax reform in the past			1
it can and must do so again if we are going to survive in the 21st century			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			0

@entity203 : the most dysfunctional part of federal policy is the tax code
he says @entity80 defends loopholes , betrays its past with huge deficit spending , borrowing
@entity203 says @entity79 falsely claim that taxing the rich more heavily will solve @entity11 debt woes
he argues for grand *compromise* on tax reform along lines of @entity93 's 1986 deal
