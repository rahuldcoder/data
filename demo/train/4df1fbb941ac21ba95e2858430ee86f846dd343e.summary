-- @entity1 was walking through bishop @entity3 's church one day when he saw something that disturbed him			1
he stared at a 30 - foot banner draped behind the pulpit of @entity7			2
it displayed a profile of a grinning @entity3 with the caption : " what is @entity13 up to ? " " everywhere you went in that church , his name and face was there , " says @entity1 , an assistant professor of religion at @entity15 in @entity16			1
" his image has replaced the cross			2
" @entity3 's image is now under assault			1
four young men have filed civil lawsuits accusing him of abusing his spiritual authority to coerce them into sexual relationships , allegations he has denied in a statement issued by his attorney			0
while most people focus on the men 's allegations , few have paid attention to how long acquired and maintains his authority at @entity42 , which has an estimated 25,000 members			1
@entity3 and @entity42 are virtually synonymous			1
the 57 - year - old pastor has built a devoted following at his church in @entity47 , @entity48 , by preaching the prosperity gospel , making savvy business decisions and through public displays of generosity			0
but @entity3 has also talked about ridding his congregation of its deacon board during his early years , and by consistently telling his congregation that he speaks for @entity13			1
@entity3 's controversial megachurch ' mentor ' @entity3 's leadership style at @entity42 follows a similar pattern at many megachurches ( congregations of 2,000 and above )			1
pastors can acquire so much unchecked power that members are afraid to challenge them , says @entity66 , co-author of " @entity67 : what we can learn from @entity70 's @entity69			2
" if members of such a megachurch dare to bring any accusations against a minister , they are often greeted with hostility by the congregation , says @entity66 , a religion professor at the @entity78 in @entity79			1
" if somebody comes and brings an accusation against the pastor , people ask , ' who are we going to trust ? the person i do n't know or the person i 've been giving 10 percent of my income to for the last eight years ? ' " @entity66 wrote his dissertation on an @entity91 megachurch near @entity42 that collapsed after its pastor was caught in a sex scandal that involved his brother 's wife and many other women			1
that pastor , @entity97 , was a " quasi-mentor " to @entity3 , @entity66 says			1
they appeared in public together			0
read more stories about faith on @entity0 's @entity103 @entity104 , author of " @entity105 : @entity108 , @entity109 and the @entity110 , " says @entity3 considered @entity107 his " spiritual mentor			1
" @entity66 says the problems at @entity107 's church festered for years because @entity107 convinced his congregation that questioning him would be seen as an act of rebellion			0
@entity107 's church , @entity117 , once had at least 15,000 members who worshipped in a soaring cathedral			2
the church was forced to sell the cathedral after its pastor 's scandal became public			0
" that church was a sick place and even i did n't know it until after two years of studying it , " @entity66 says			0
' he is finished ' some church scholars wonder if @entity42 will suffer the same fate			1
on sunday , @entity42 appeared to throw its support behind @entity3			1
@entity42 members leapt to their feet to cheer @entity3 as he vowed to fight the allegations			1
@entity3 took to the stage with his wife , @entity133 , and compared himself to @entity134 fighting @entity135			1
" i 've got five rocks , and i have n't thrown one yet , " @entity3 said			1
@entity3 during his church appearance did not address the specific allegations contained in the four lawsuits filed against him			1
@entity3 , in a statement read on a syndicated radio show thursday , denied the allegations			2
" let me be clear : the charges against me and @entity42 are false , " the statement said			2
" i have devoted my life to helping others and these false allegations hurt me deeply , but my faith is strong and the truth will emerge			0
" @entity151 , a sociology professor at @entity152 in @entity153 , says @entity3 had to unequivocally deny the allegations from the pulpit to maintain @entity42 's support			1
" his ministry is over , " says @entity151 , author of " @entity157 : @entity159 and the @entity160 , " which looks at the appeal of celebrity preachers			2
@entity151 has written extensively about how big business has shaped megachurch pastors			2
" what i saw was more lamb than lion , " @entity151 says			0
" i did n't see the truculent , masculine preacher			0
there should have been some pent up sense of outrage			0
" @entity3 's demise will take place over time , but it is inevitable , @entity151 says			2
read details about the suits " i have seen many pastors survive scandals where it was a woman , " he says			0
" but it 's unprecedented for a leading black evangelical of his reputation to survive the taint of same - sex charges			0
" how @entity3 took charge at @entity42 @entity3 's ascension at @entity42 did n't seem likely at first			1
when he started as a pastor , he was so nervous before preaching that he often threw up			0
he started with 300 members			2
when @entity3 arrived at @entity42 , he had to consult with a deacon and trustee board			1
@entity3 wrote in his book , " taking over , " that @entity42 's deacon board was " gripping the purse strings " of the church , and " telling the man of @entity13 when to jump and how high			1
" after the church grew , @entity3 told the congregation that he received a revelation from @entity13 that @entity42 's governing structure was " ungodly , " he recounted in " @entity201			1
" @entity3 said the board relinquished its authority over him with his congregation 's approval			2
" that was the day i became pastor , " @entity3 wrote in " taking over			2
" " up until that time , i was the hired preacher			0
" as time went on , @entity3 also embraced a more charismatic approach to ministry ( charismatics encourage @entity212 to develop " gifts of the @entity214 , " such as speaking in tongues )			1
the minister 's job was n't just to preach , @entity3 once said in a profile in the @entity219			2
" a pastor is called to minister to @entity13 , " he said			0
" then @entity13 ministers back to him the word , and he comes before the people to tell them what @entity13 said			0
" it is not unusual for pastors to portray themselves as vessels of @entity13 's revelations			0
@entity3 also , in time , became something else to some of his parishioners : " @entity13 's anointed , " says @entity151 , the @entity152 professor			1
when outsiders would question @entity3 's leadership , @entity42 members would often cite @entity236 105 , verse 15 : " touch not my anointed ones , and do my prophets no harm			1
'' @entity151 says some charismatic leaders invoke @entity236 105 to discourage criticism			0
" it 's a great scripture to try to keep people from questioning their leader and keep them in line , " @entity151 says			0
" but there 's another scripture in @entity248 : ' by their fruits ye shall know them			0
' '' @entity1 , the @entity15 professor who saw the giant banner of @entity3 behind the pulpit , says @entity3 's stature at @entity42 as @entity13 's anointed inspires fierce devotion			1
" people come to believe that to turn on him is to not be committed to @entity13 , " @entity1 says			0
@entity1 asks @entity3 : did you or did n't you ? marketing a megachurch there are business reasons , though , for some megachurch pastors to consolidate authority in a church , says @entity66 , the megachurch scholar			1
" it 's much easier to market a personality than it is to market a church , " says @entity66			0
many megachurches are financially dependent on the appeal of a solitary pastor , @entity66 says			0
the pastor 's sermons , television broadcasts , books and tapes -- all bring in the crowds			0
as the pastor grows in popularity , though , he loses accountability , @entity66 says			0
he or she becomes a celebrity			0
" what ends up happening is the authority structure goes from having a church with a board of elders who consult and fight over power with the senior pastors to one where the pastor has selected people on the board who are more or less yes people , " @entity66 says			0
retaining the loyalty of a congregation , though , is another challenge for a megachurch pastor like @entity3 , says the rev. @entity298 , senior pastor of @entity8 in @entity91			1
he says @entity3 can retain @entity42 's support if he appears transparent before his congregation in the days ahead			1
" what people want to see is a certain sense of humility , a certain ' i 'm back under the will of @entity13 and he has appointed me to lead if you trust me			0
' at that point , he can pick and go on and do what @entity13 has called him to do			0
" but if @entity3 does n't seem sincere , he will suffer , @entity298 says			2
" if he 's perceived as manipulative , " @entity298 says , " he 's finished			0
