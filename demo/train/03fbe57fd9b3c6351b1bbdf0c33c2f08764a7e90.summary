-- the bizarre case of a @entity3 - bound ship being seized and searched following a violent struggle on the @entity5 sounds like a deleted scene from the @entity7			1
but officials fearing some sort of modern - day @entity10 could only have been relieved to find out that what @entity11 describes as an assortment of antique @entity15 weapons discovered aboard the ship -- buried under 255,000 sacks of brown sugar -- are more suited to a @entity7 museum than they are to being used as weapons in the 21st century			1
the ship , which is still being searched by @entity23 officials , contained 240 tons of @entity25 - made defensive weapons including two anti-aircraft missile systems , nine missiles in parts and spares and two @entity31 - 21 jets , according to @entity11 officials			1
@entity5 has n't yet detailed what has been seized			0
@entity34 : @entity5 finds arms on @entity3 ship @entity11 says the weapons , which were en route to @entity3 for repairs , are " obsolete			1
" and experts who identified early @entity7 relics like the @entity15 - designed @entity43 air defense system among the ship 's cargo say that 's not far from the truth			1
" we are talking about really old stuff -- that technology was designed in the 1940s and 50s , " said @entity48 , editor of @entity49 and @entity50			0
" very few countries still employ the sa - 2 system as a frontline defensive weapon			0
" the @entity43 , which consists of a single radar - guided missile mounted on a launcher , was developed years before the @entity10 in 1960 and was used by the @entity59 during the @entity60 , long before the advent of heat - seeking or satellite - guided missiles			0
men sitting in radar trucks on the ground had to guide the rockets toward their targets			0
@entity48 says the tactic , if you were an @entity71 pilot in @entity60 , was to " watch this damn great thing coming toward you and at the last minute pull a heavy right or left , and the missile could n't follow you , it just kept going			0
" " today there is no reason for any @entity78 pilot to be hit by an @entity43 -- if you get caught by one of them , you 've done something bloody stupid , or you 've got very bad luck			0
no modern country wants to be seen with those			2
" but @entity3 and @entity11 , isolated communist allies and trading partners since the @entity7 , are n't modern countries , to say the least -- and after years of sanctions and embargoes there are few places ( and even less cash ) at their disposal to obtain new weapons , according to experts			1
@entity95 : @entity3 continues banned weapons trade " if you buy a new weapons system , you also have to buy the hardware and the training , which can take a year or more if you buy some of the more modern air defense systems that the @entity25 sell , " said @entity97 , @entity98 at @entity99			1
" and the @entity11 do n't have the money			0
" even if @entity11 had the money , countries like @entity25 would be reluctant to sell the @entity109 regime advanced weapons systems for fear of infuriating the @entity71			2
and even if @entity11 obtained newer weapons , @entity97 says the @entity71 would still overwhelm them in short order			0
what 's left for countries like @entity11 is to seek repairs on systems like the @entity43 , which went out of commission decades ago , and the @entity31 - 21 jet , which was last produced in 1985 and is now mostly kept by long - time @entity25 allies for spare parts , according to @entity48 at @entity50			2
as @entity23 authorities continue to search the @entity124 -- a freighter with its own checkered past -- they are asking the @entity71 and @entity127 to send teams to help them identify the weapons , and will invite a special commission from the @entity95 to determine whether the shipment violates the organization 's @entity3 weapons ban			1
in the meantime , experts do n't expect the episode will have a lasting effect diplomatically on either country -- @entity3 is already " sanctioned to the hilt , " says @entity139 , and @entity11 's relations with the @entity71 are thawing after decades of tension			2
" there are a good number of people who believe that the sanctions against @entity11 are very outdated and that it 's just a matter of time before they 're lifted , and i do n't see this changing that , " @entity139 told @entity0			0
the more lasting impression of the raid on ship could , in the end , be the 10,000 tons of brown sugar found on - board the ship			0
the crew attempted to sabotage the @entity124 by cutting the cables on its cargo cranes , meaning @entity23 authorities have had to remove the 255,000 bags of sugar by hand			2
experts believe the sugar could be @entity11 payment to cash - strapped @entity3 in exchange for the weapons repairs			1
" this will be much ado about nothing , except telling the world just how bad a shape @entity11 and @entity3 are in today -- bartering early @entity7 materials for sugar , that speaks volumes , " said @entity139 .			1

@entity23 authorities raid @entity3 ship , find @entity11 weapons
@entity25 - made weapons seized are @entity7 relics from the 1950s , say experts
expert on @entity43 system : " no modern country wants to be seen with those "
expert : " bartering @entity7 materials for sugar speaks volumes " about nations
