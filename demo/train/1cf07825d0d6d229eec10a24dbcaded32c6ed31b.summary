-- @entity1 spent an hour talking about her landmark job as @entity4 's first ever professional female coach for a male team thursday but her message was simple and succinct			1
" look at me as a normal coach , " said the 36 - year - old as she was unveiled by second - tier side @entity8			1
@entity10 is the first female to be given the head job in the top two divisions of one of @entity16 's big five leagues -- @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity4			1
more than 100 journalists -- as well as some of the club 's players -- assembled at the @entity26 stadium to meet the @entity27 who is hoping her appointment will inspire other female coaches			1
" i know it 's a big step , " said @entity10 , who left her role as coach of the @entity35 national women 's team to accept the position with @entity26			2
" i know because i had a career before in a man 's world mainly , so i know it 's an important day and it can open other doors , or not			2
" i understand your surprise and the quantity of press and the impact but , we are in 2014 , it should be a normal thing			0
" @entity10 , a sports science graduate , has been rewarded following her work with the @entity35 and @entity56 women 's national teams			0
she also led @entity59 's male youth team to two @entity61 titles and spent time as a scout with @entity64 club @entity63			2
her reputation has even spawned the nickname " @entity67 in a skirt " in her home country , a reference to @entity72 's most high - profile football manager , @entity73 boss @entity67			1
the football season has just finished in @entity4 and @entity8 finished 14th in @entity75 but @entity10 already has big plans for her first season in charge			1
" i think that as in all leagues , if a club does n't have a huge budget that does n't mean that the players should not be ambitious and committed , " she said			0
" between the team we will define our objectives but winning is the common word that we are going to speak			0
i 'm here to win			0
" i 'm a demanding person with myself and my team , but especially with myself			0
" @entity10 will find herself under extra external scrutiny too as the highest profile female coach of a male professional football team in @entity16			1
the 36 - year - old is also pushing boundaries in @entity4 where match official @entity97 previously broke new ground as an assistant referee , also featuring in @entity101 games			1
sexist society @entity4 football writer @entity103 told @entity104 that @entity10 's appointment was something of a shock			1
" @entity4 society is a little bit sexist in sport , really sexist , " she said			0
" so it was a big surprise and a lot of people said it was a bad idea			0
" at first in @entity4 everybody thought that @entity26 just wanted to create a buzz with the appointment			2
" but then @entity1 came to @entity4 two weeks ago and she spoke a lot to the @entity4 media and she explained who she was			2
" now we understand that she has a real project with @entity26 and she wants to prove she can be a real coach like men			0
" @entity10 will get her first chance to prove herself when the new @entity4 soccer season begins late summer .			0

@entity1 is first female to be given top coaching job in top two tiers of @entity16 's big five leagues
" look at me as a normal coach , " says the new boss of @entity4 club @entity8
the 36 - year - old hopes her appointment " can open doors " for other female coaches
