@entity0 -- @entity2 -- the world 's ubiquitous brown fizzy drink -- is staying afloat as the soda market shrinks , and many point to a marketing strategy around the so - called " secret recipe " as key to its resilience in a struggling industry			1
the @entity12 , which published its full year result tuesday , recorded a 5 % drop in net income to $ 8.6 billion last year , down from $ 9 billion in 2012 , as it faced " ongoing global macroeconomic challenges , " according to its chief executive @entity17			0
volume grew 2 % for the year , which it said was " below our expectations and long - term growth target , " with sparkling beverages recording a slight increase of 1 % -- led by @entity2			1
globally , soda drink sales have been shrinking as consumers turn to water , fruit drinks and healthier alternatives			2
the trend has hit @entity2 and other market players such as @entity32 and @entity33			1
and while its primary competitor , @entity32 , depends on its snack business to buoy the declining soda sales , @entity2 announced further investment into its marketing			1
in a tough market , one strategy that brand experts credit @entity2 's relative strength with is the mystery around the much - hyped " secret recipe			1
" " the very idea of mystery attracts attention , and is often seen as an element of quality , " says social psychologist and marketing expert @entity45 , lecturer at @entity47 and @entity48			0
" a typical consumer would think that it must be a valuable product if they are doing all these things to protect the recipe			0
" @entity2 's " secret recipe " story -- on which it has centered advertising campaigns and built into its corporate museum --- reaches back nearly a century			1
according to the multi-national 's website , the original recipe was only written down in 1919 , more than half a century after a reported morphine addict and pharmacist @entity63 invented the drink in 1886			1
until then , it was passed down by word of mouth			0
the formula was finally committed to paper when a group of investors led by @entity75 took out a loan to purchase the company in 1919			0
" as collateral , he provided a written record of the @entity2 secret formula , " @entity2 said in a statement on its site			1
since the 1920s , the document sat locked in a bank in @entity87 , until @entity2 decided to emphasize the secret in its marketing strategy			1
86 years later , @entity2 moved the recipe into a purpose - built vault within the @entity92 , the company 's museum in @entity87			1
the ambiance is made complete by red lighting and fake smoke			0
@entity2 has always claimed only two senior executives know the formula at any given time , although they have never revealed names or positions			1
but according to an advertising campaign based around the recipe , they ca n't travel on the same plane			0
the vault , like one straight from a film , has a palm scanner , a numerical code pad and massive steel door			0
inside its walls , there 's another safe box with more security features			0
and inside that , a metal case containing what its owners call " the most guarded trade secret in the world			2
" a piece of paper with , according to @entity2 , a recipe inside			1
but @entity125 , author of " for @entity126 , @entity127 & @entity2 , " is skeptical			2
" @entity63 invented @entity2 in 1886 , at the height of the patent medicine era , and one of the ironies of that name is that no one actually patented such creations , " he says			1
" they kept the formulas secret , partly in order to increase sales with a sense of special mystery and to prevent competition , but also to keep people from knowing how cheap the ingredients were and how large the profits , " he says			0
the company has never patented the formula , saying to do so would require its disclosure			2
and once the patent expired , anyone would be able to use that recipe to produce a generic version of the world famous drink			1
" [ the secrecy ] creates a natural curiosity about the product itself			0
consumers are more likely to try to find out the recipe , " @entity45 says , adding it creates a legend around @entity2 's flagship drink			1
scores of recipes have emerged through the decades			0
their authors usually claim to have cracked the original recipe by getting hold of antique documents			0
so far , @entity2 has rejected all of them as fantasy , saying there is only one " ' real thing '			2
" @entity125 's book includes two versions of the original formula			0
" one is a facsimile in the handwriting of @entity179 , the ' unsung hero ' of @entity2 who named the drink , wrote the famous script logo , manufactured the drink in its early days , and advertised it , " he says			1
does he think the recipe is genuine ? " yes			0
i think that both of the @entity2 formulas in my book are the ' real thing , ' versions of the original formula for @entity2 , " he says			2
" in the end , the exact formula is n't really the issue , " he says			0
@entity125 reiterates a tale told in his book , in which he speaks to a @entity2 spokesperson who points out that even if its competitors got hold of the formula , they would n't be able to compete			2
" why would anyone go out of their way to buy @entity205 , which is really just like @entity2 but costs more , when they can buy the @entity207 anywhere in the world ? , " he was told			2
