@entity0 -- lithium - ion batteries , under global scrutiny following @entity7 fires , likely have a future in aviation provided there are adequate safeguards , a top @entity3 safety advocate said on wednesday			1
" i would not want to categorically say that these batteries are not safe			2
any new technology , any new design , there are going to be some inherent risks , " @entity13 , chairman of the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , said in @entity0			1
@entity13 added that the agency , which investigates transportation accidents and other incidents , is still " several weeks away " from determining electrical problems that have grounded the @entity7 worldwide in recent weeks			1
her investigators are specifically looking at a fire in early january that destroyed one of the two powerful batteries embedded in the belly of a @entity7 while the plane was on the ground in @entity30			2
" we need to understand why ( the @entity30 fire ) happened and we need to make sure that in future installations that those risks are mitigated , " she said			2
another battery - related incident that forced an emergency landing of a @entity7 several days after the @entity30 incident is part of the investigation that also includes the @entity41 , @entity43 regulators and @entity7			1
although there are only @entity46 in service worldwide , the stakes are high for the world 's largest aircraft manufacturer			0
following a difficult development , @entity7 has several hundred 787s on order at roughly $ 200 million apiece			2
the @entity7 is the first commercial aircraft to have extensive use of lithium - ion batteries , which can hold more electrical power in a smaller , lighter space			1
the battery type , used in starting the 787s two engines and running its auxiliary power system , is susceptible to thermal runaway -- a chemical chain reaction -- if overcharged or undercharged			2
resulting fires can be difficult to extinguish			0
the safety board has determined that thermal runaway and a short circuit occurred on the damaged 787 in @entity30			1
but it has not concluded which event occurred first , or whether they were the cause or the effect of the fire			0
@entity13 noted that the safety board has long had concerns about lithium - ion battery technology because of fire risk			1
" that is never more important than in aviation , " @entity13 said			2
" they ( aircraft ) do n't have the opportunity to pull over when there 's a fire			0
they do n't always have accessible compartments			0
they do n't have fire suppression in some of those areas			0
and so that is where we have raised concerns in the past			0
" the @entity14 also has concerns about that battery technology being shipped as cargo , saying the packaging and labeling is crucial to safe shipment			1
but she expressed hope that there were technological solutions to the technological problems			0
" we want to see that ( battery technology ) move forward			1
but the safety side of that is making sure that you 've done the right risk assessment ; that you understand what the failure modes are and that you 've mitigated any potential risks			2
" lithium - ion battery experts consulted by @entity1 say the batteries are safe for use in aviation			1
" the lithium - ion batteries can be safely transported on an airplane as long as the appropriate procedure for transporting them is followed , " said @entity116 of @entity118 's @entity117			1
in fact , " these lithium - ion batteries are safer than most chemicals being transported , " he said			1
@entity116 said he believes the root cause of the @entity30 fire was a problem with the management or the monitoring system of the battery , not the battery itself			0
" if you ban the transportation of lithium - ion batteries , everyone has to throw away their laptops , cell phones , @entity141 , etcetera , before they board the airplane			1
can you imagine that ? " he said			0
battery expert @entity145 also said batteries almost never self - combust			1
" you can never say never			0
but it is almost impossible to have a thermal runaway that would cause the combustion that you 're talking about , " he said			0
lithium - ion battery failures during use " are very rare , " said @entity145			1
" the statistics that we have are on computer batteries			0
and the cells that go into computer batteries have a failure rate of one in 10 million or even one in 40 million cells			0
so it 's quite rare , " he said			0
however , the fire incidents aboard the two @entity46 very early in the plane 's life has raised concern among safety experts			0
@entity7 has said its technical experts are working " around the clock " and are focused on " resolving the issue " and returning the 787 to service .			2
