@entity0 , @entity1 below ground here will be rescued in early november and maybe sooner			1
" everything is going a little bit better than anticipated , " @entity8 told @entity2 about the three holes -- dubbed @entity10 , @entity11 , and @entity12 -- being dug in an effort to open a passageway to safety for the men			1
" on plan a we did n't have to change the drill bit at 200 meters [ 656 feet ] but instead we were able to drill and change it at 320 meters [ 1,050 feet ] , " he said			0
" @entity11 today reached 500 meters [ 1,640 feet ] and we 're reaching 700 meters [ 2,296 feet ] probably by this weekend			1
" we have finished assembly of the @entity25 drill and that will be ready to start operating over the next couple of days possibly this weekend			1
" he added , " so , we 're optimistic we will comply with our target date at the beginning of november and , if everything stays on path and we have no big problems , then it could be earlier			1
" plan a and @entity11 each require two holes to be drilled -- a small hole first and then a wider one about 26 to 28 inches ( 65 - 70 centimeters ) in diameter			1
@entity8 said the second pass would be slower progress than the first pass			0
" it 's like eating a donut , " he said			2
" what we are doing first is eating a little bit a around the hole in the middle of the donut and then we have to eat the rest of the donut and that is slower			2
" drilling under @entity10 will stop this weekend once the drill bit reaches 1,247 feet ( 380 meters ) , then the drill will receive scheduled maintenance before resuming early next week , engineer @entity53 said			1
according to @entity8 , the first stage of drilling on @entity11 has reached a depth of 1,640 feet ( 500 meters ) and will pierce the ceiling of the mine shaft where the men are trapped this weekend			1
the assembly of the drill to be used in @entity12 has been completed , he said , adding that he hoped it would begin drilling this weekend			1
plan a involves using a drill placed directly above the shelter where the miners are holed up			0
engineers estimated last week that this plan would take between three and four months to complete the hole at 701 meters ( 2,300 feet )			2
under @entity11 , a hole is being drilled at a roughly 80 - degree angle into an area of the mine shaft that is used as a mechanical workshop			1
that distance , engineers estimate , is around 2,034 feet ( 620 meters )			0
the drill used in @entity12 would need to cut through some 1,969 feet ( 600 meters ) of rock and earth , they said			0
@entity8 said rescue workers were betting which plan would rescue the miners			1
" between our teams members we are betting one another a barbecue , but i wo n't tell you which one i 'm betting on			2
but no matter which plan wins , i will be very happy if we can have them back as soon as possible			0
" two bore holes -- each about 8 centimeters in diameter -- are currently being used to supply the miners			0
the first carries compressed air , water , communications and a constant supply of electricity to power lights that are intended to simulate daytime and nighttime			0
supplies -- such as food , clothing and letters -- are sent down to the miners via metal cylinders known as " carrier pigeons " through the second bore hole			2
@entity8 said the miners ' pay was being distributed to their families from the mutual security system			0
" and in the future , due to their heroism , they will probably be welcome to work anywhere , " he said			0
the company has continued " for now " to pay the salaries of some 300 other mine employees who have not been working since the august 5 cave - in , he said			0
" we have to see in the future but we , as the government , are prepared to give them the right support , and to help them in the process to defend their rights and to help them find jobs on the future , " he said			0
two prototypes of cages to be used to hoist the men to the surface will be reviewed tuesday as will the design of the winch , @entity8 said			1
he predicted the cage that is used will have a diameter of 55 centimeters ( 21.7 inches ) to 60 centimeters ( 23.6 inches ) and will be pulled upward at a rate of one meter per second , meaning each man could make the trip in 10 to 12 minutes			0
previous estimates had suggested it could take 2 - 1/2 hours to hoist and then lower the cage ,			2
asked whether new laws were needed to enforce mining codes , @entity8 said the laws were not to blame for the men 's predicament : " the problem was that the owners did not do what they were told to , " he said			1
" not because it was too expensive or they were greedy , but just because they did n't care			0
... we have got good regulations but maybe we need to improve auditing of those regulations			0
" representatives of the owner , the @entity171 , have said previously they will collaborate fully with @entity1 authorities and the @entity173 in their inquiries about what went wrong at the mine			1
@entity2 's @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this story .			2

new : prototypes of cages to be used to hoist the men to the surface to be reviewed
new : *crews* are betting on which of three drilling efforts will lead to rescue
@entity1 's mining minister : rescue by early november or earlier is possible
lead hole for @entity11 expected to break through to cavern this weekend
