@entity0 -- in @entity0 's upscale diplomatic district , @entity2 lives in a parallel world			0
for years , his home has been a rickety shanty that he shares with his ailing wife , a young son , a daughter - in - law and two grandchildren			2
now 62 , @entity2 has lived through @entity11 's journey as an independent nation			1
he finds little reason to rejoice as the country celebrates monday , the 64th anniversary of freedom from @entity18 rule			1
" the poor have hardly benefited , " he says			1
sitting on a cot in his shack huddled in a squalid slum in one of the richest neighborhoods of the @entity11 capital , he bitterly recalls how flooding in his native village ravaged his ancestral land way back in 1978 and forced him to move to the city in search of work			1
but today , @entity2 says , the family of six can barely manage $ 130 a month			0
" this is no development ... or growth			0
i think we have moved backwards , " he says			0
@entity2 typifies the hand - to - mouth existence millions of @entity11 still live despite the nation 's rise as @entity41 's third - largest economy			2
in a speech on the eve of his country 's independence in 1947 , @entity11 's first prime minister , @entity42 , made an impassioned call to fight and end " poverty and ignorance and disease			1
" sixty - four years later , his successors accept that that fight is far from over			2
" we have to banish poverty and illiteracy from our country			0
we have to provide the common man with access to improved health services , " prime minister @entity56 said in his annual @entity58 address monday			1
according to the @entity62 , @entity11 is home to one - third of the world 's poor			1
corruption , policymakers have agreed over the years , is a major culprit			1
" corruption manifests itself in many forms , " @entity56 said in what has been a refrain by @entity11 planners on the chronic scourge			1
" in some instances , funds meant for schemes for the welfare of the common man end up in the pocket of government officials			1
in some other instances , government discretion is used to favor a select few			0
there are also cases where government contracts are wrongfully awarded to the wrong people			0
we can not let such activities continue unchecked			0
" @entity56 's remarks came ahead of a hunger strike anti-corruption activists have planned to press for an anti-graft law stronger than the legislation introduced in @entity94 this month to create a citizen ombudsman			2
@entity11 leaders concede no single measure will work to combat corruption , which is believed to be deeply entrenched in the system			1
" i believe that there is no single big step which we can take to eradicate corruption			2
in fact , we will have to act simultaneously on many fronts , " @entity56 said			2
he disapproved of hunger strikes as a means to push demands			0
as @entity11 's finance minister , @entity56 unleashed economic reforms in the 1990s that dismantled stiffening regulations and opened the nation to foreign capital			1
this year , @entity11 also marked another milestone event : the 20th anniversary of liberalization			1
but the occasion has been clouded by massive corruption scandals in @entity56 's administration and a rigid inflation crushing impoverished groups and the country 's growing middle - class alike			1
criticism is mounting against the nation 's political establishment			0
" the twin monsters @entity11 faces today are inflation and corruption , both of which could derail the @entity11 growth story			1
to keep that story going , today 's dysfunctional political class will need to radically re-invent itself , " wrote the @entity135 in an editorial headlined " batting at 64			0
" @entity11 's marginalized communities often feel forced to compromise skills that are key to eliminating poverty			2
fears haunt @entity2 that his grandchildren , like his son , also might not be able to achieve higher education if economic conditions at home do not improve			0
and @entity2 's cab - driver son , @entity149 , leaves it to luck			0
" i am trying my best to see that my children do n't face the same circumstances that i went through			0
i am putting my best efforts			0
the rest is their luck , " @entity149 said .			0

@entity11 is marking its 64th anniversary of freedom from @entity18 rule
" the poor have hardly benefited , " says one man
prime minister @entity56 admits much needs to be done for the " common man "
policymakers have agreed over the years that corruption is a major factor
