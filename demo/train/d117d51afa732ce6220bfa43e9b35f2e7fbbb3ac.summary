-- captain @entity1 guided @entity2 to a second @entity4 title on saturday as his team beat tournament co-hosts @entity7 by six wickets in the final in @entity10			1
@entity1 , the world 's highest - paid player , produced his best performance of the six - week - long event when it mattered most as @entity2 passed @entity7 's total of 274 - 6 with 10 balls of the allotted 50 overs to spare			1
the 29 - year - old smashed the winning runs with a huge six over the boundary ropes to finish the innings unbeaten on 91 off only 79 balls faced			1
he set up victory with his fourth - wicket partnership of 109 with @entity24 , who top - scored with an invaluable 97 , after coming to the batting crease at 114 - 3 in the 22nd over			0
duel of the cricket demi - gods @entity7 , winners of the tournament in 1996 and runners - up in the last staging four years ago , set a potentially testing target for @entity2 thanks to an unbeaten 103 from captain @entity32			1
with the victory , @entity2 -- the top - ranked team in cricket 's five - day test format -- assumed the no. 1 position in the limited - overs game ahead of previous champions @entity40			1
it was a successful farewell for @entity2 's @entity43 coach @entity42 , who is ending his four - year tenure			2
the final , the first between two @entity48 teams in the tournament 's 36 - year history , was billed as a battle between two of the game 's greatest players : @entity2 batsman @entity55 and his fellow record - setter , bowler @entity56 of @entity7			1
when cricket means more than just a match however , the 37 - year - old @entity55 made only 18 after opening the @entity60 innings , meaning that the world 's highest run - scorer in all formats of the game finished second in this tournament behind @entity7 's @entity66 -- who added 33 for an overall total of 500 runs from nine innings			1
however , he had the satisfaction of earning his first @entity4 win in his sixth appearance at the tournament since 1992 , playing on his home ground where he made his first - class debut for @entity10 with a century at the age of 15			2
" i could n't have asked for more , " @entity55 told the crowd after being carried around the @entity79 on the shoulders of his teammates			0
" winning the @entity4 is the ultimate thing			0
it is the proudest moment of my life			0
it shows it is never too late			0
i thank my teammates , who were fabulous			0
i could not really hold back my tears			0
these are happy tears so i do n't mind crying			0
" @entity56 , playing his final match before retiring , was unable to add to his 15 wickets in the tournament as he was visibly hampered by the injuries that threatened to rule him out of the match			2
@entity56 , who turns 39 next month , ended his career with a record 800 test and 534 one - day wickets			0
@entity2 's @entity98 picked up two more wickets to join @entity100 as the tournament 's leading bowler on 21 , having played one more match after his team beat @entity105 in the semifinals on wednesday			1
@entity7 won the pre-match toss of the coin and chose to bat first , but needed late fireworks from @entity32 -- who scored his runs off only 88 balls -- plus @entity113 ( 32 ) and @entity114 ( 22 ) after a mid-innings dip			2
fast bowler @entity116 gave @entity7 hope when he dismissed both @entity55 and @entity118 ( 0 ) but @entity24 added 83 with @entity119 ( 35 ) to steady the run chase			0
@entity1 then upped the scoring rate , and @entity2 appeared to be cruising until @entity24 attempted a rash shot in sight of his 10th one - day century and was bowled by @entity114			1
that left @entity2 needing 52 to win off 54 balls , but @entity1 turned the tide again when he hit the first six of @entity2 's innings off @entity114 -- and then survived an appeal for a run out that required several replays before the video umpire made his ruling			1
@entity1 was given able assistance by @entity135 , who ended the game unbeaten on 21 from 24 balls and was later named man of the tournament for his consistent displays with bat and ball .			2
