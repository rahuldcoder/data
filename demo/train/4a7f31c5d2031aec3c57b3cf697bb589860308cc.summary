-- for some people , wednesday was a day to celebrate			2
thursday , they get back to work			2
advocates of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights say they 've gained fresh energy and hope after twin @entity11 rulings advanced efforts to legalize same - sex marriage			1
they want to ride that momentum for as far as possible -- making inroads on issues ranging from workplace discrimination protections , immigration reform to bully - free schools			1
" this is absolutely historic , it 's monumental , " said @entity21 , executive director of @entity20 , or @entity20			1
" it may very well be that tipping point			2
" for people such as @entity21 , who heads a group with more than 360 chapters nationwide , what happened wednesday was thrilling , but not totally surprising			2
@entity11 strikes down @entity28 yes , most states still bar same - sex marriage , many thanks to the passage of popular referendums			1
yes , the federal government and most states do n't protect gay , lesbian or transgendered workers			1
but public opinion is moving in the direction of lgbt rights			2
in the 1970s , polls showed most @entity43 believed homosexual relationships between consenting adults were morally wrong -- a belief that persisted into the first few years of the 21st century , according to @entity0 polling director @entity47			2
in contrast , the most recent @entity0 / @entity49 survey shows 55 % of @entity43 back same - sex marriage , up 11 percentage points from 2008			1
voters in three states approved measures legalizing such unions in november 2012			1
numerous corporations have adopted policies barring discrimination based on one 's sexual orientation -- contrary to the laws in most states , where a person could still be fired if they are found out to be gay			1
two of @entity43 's most watched tv shows , " @entity67 " and " @entity68 , " feature openly gay characters			2
@entity71 had been a pioneer of sorts in the 1990s , when he played a gay teen on @entity76 's " @entity75			2
" @entity78 appeal dismissed times have changed since then , he said , as @entity43 get to know more gays and lesbians -- whether they are cousins , neighbors or characters on tv shows			1
the @entity11 decisions striking down part of the @entity28 and clearing the way for same - sex marriages in @entity90 could accelerate the movement even more , according to @entity71			1
" i really do believe this is the domino that is going to tip over the rest of the dominoes , " he said			0
" do not get in the way of this train , because it will run you over			0
" same - sex marriage still illegal in most states @entity102 can now make wedding plans			1
he and his partner live in @entity105 , where same - sex marriage will ( once again ) be legal			1
@entity102 , who is @entity107 , has lived in the @entity43 legally for the past 16 years , first as head of the @entity105 @entity109 and @entity110 , and now as chief marketing officer for @entity112 and @entity113			0
what occurred wednesday gave him pride to live in his adopted home			0
" as an international citizen , ( it ) gives me so much gratitude because i see the very best that exists in this great nation , " @entity102 said			0
" ... it 's truly a beautiful thing			0
" historic rulings on same - sex marriage still , while he and other @entity128 advocates characterized the court rulings as victories in their fight for equal rights , that does n't mean the fight is over			1
some 70 % of @entity43 live in the 37 states where same - sex marriage is not or will soon not be legal			1
in his ruling opinion , justice @entity136 said one reason the federal government is obliged to recognize gay and lesbian marriages that are legal in some places is because it is up to individual states to decide marriage law			1
that 's more likely to happen now than a few years ago , said @entity146 , a spokesman for the @entity147			0
@entity128 advocates have learned to make their campaigns more about people wanting to be together than people wanting to get rights and benefits , he said			1
" we have really focused on the reasons why they want to get married : because they love each other , " @entity154 said			0
" that 's really helped change the nature of the conversation			0
" daughter of interracial couple fights to validate her same - sex marriage workplace a battleground in @entity128 fight the @entity168 makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against people based on their race , color , religion , sex or national origin			1
but not their sexual identity			0
that means , under federal law , there 's nothing to prevent a worker from failing to hire or firing someone because they are gay or lesbian			0
ruling opens doors for immigration for same - sex spouses there are 21 states that do offer such protections , which leaves 29 that do not			1
in 34 states , there 's nothing to prevent a person from getting fired if they are transgendered			1
activists are working to change that			2
@entity102 points to the @entity201 working its way through a @entity204 committee , calling now a " crucial moment " for politicians to change federal policy			0
the measure has 53 cosponsors , short of the 60 votes that bills typically need nowadays to pass if it 's opposed by the @entity213 minority			0
if it does pass , it would then have to be passed in the @entity213 - led @entity215			2
@entity216 , the founder and ceo of @entity112 and @entity113 , says she 's " very hopeful " a bill that includes protections for gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered people will pass			2
the larger movement in the society is a big reason why , she says			0
" any time people get to know us as human beings , it makes a huge difference , " @entity227 said			0
" more and more people , all the time , are coming out			0
when that person has a relationship with others , it moves the dial forward			0
" map : same - sex marriage in the @entity43 @entity241 could take its cue from corporate america			1
on their own accord , most @entity245 companies already bar gays , lesbians and transgendered from being treated any differently than any other employee			1
why ? because they realize the importance of retaining the best people who perform well on the job , irrelevant of their sexual identity , according to @entity227			0
" it 's about the bottom line , essentially , " she says			0
activist : gay rights ' causes ' not insurmountable ' other issues are on @entity128 advocates ' agenda as well			1
they want immigration reform measures being mulled in the @entity204 and @entity215 , for instance , to treat same - sex partners much like heterosexual spouses			1
they want safer schools , so youngsters are n't threatened , hurt or otherwise victimized			0
photos : same - sex celebrity couples and they are also mindful that transgendered people have " not seen as many gains as the gay and lesbian portion of our community , " says @entity146 of the @entity147			1
" the way the media talks about transgendered people is in terms of violence and suicide rates , but those are n't the only stories , " adds @entity71 , noting that parts of @entity43 still do n't know or understand them			0
in other words , even after wednesday 's @entity11 decisions , there 's a lot that these activists ' still want to do			1
opinion : how youth led change in public attitudes on same - sex marriage and to do it , @entity21 says , means harnessing " the collective energy " of people of all sexual persuasions who share the same values			1
that kind of movement could take place not just in the halls of @entity311 , but in stores and coffee shops on @entity314			0
" i know the power that there is in individual messages from the people who are willing to speak out , " said @entity21 , who grew up in @entity315 and has seven siblings -- three of whom are homosexual , like he is , and four of whom are straight			0
" these ( challenges ) are not insurmountable			2
" @entity324 is eager to put himself out there , partner with others , work hard and make an impact			0
in his last year at @entity329 , he is working to combat poverty , address gun violence afflicting parts of @entity333 and promote fair education			0
" what i am most interested in is creating unity among everyone who seeks justice and equality , " he said			0
for him , these issues and promoting lgbt rights are all related			2
