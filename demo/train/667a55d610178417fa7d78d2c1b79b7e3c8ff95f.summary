-- i started playing sports at a young age and gravitated toward wheelchair basketball and track			1
in college , i decided to focus primarily on track and pursue my dream of going to the @entity9			1
with the support of a great coach and team , i was selected as a member of @entity14 and competed in track at the @entity9 in @entity16 in 2012			1
on saturday , april 6 , i embarked on the most challenging journey of my life			1
i left @entity19 , heading toward @entity20 in my racing wheelchair -- a 71 - day journey of 3,300 miles			1
while i did n't know what to expect or how my body would react to the demands of " pushing " the equivalent of two to three marathons a day , i knew one thing for sure -- i 'd get it done			1
i committed to push across @entity30 as my way of giving back to @entity32 , an organization that has significantly impacted my life			1
@entity35 offers a @entity37 certification program for teens and young adults with disabilities			1
i met @entity41 , founder of @entity35 , in 2005 , and was given the opportunity to learn to scuba dive			2
for me , it was a chance encounter that changed my life			2
i love to dive and have been diving ever since			2
we do all our diving in the @entity48 , most often in @entity49 , which is one of the best diving destinations in the world			2
i was chosen to be the first stay - focused mentor in 2007 , a role that enabled me to assist first - time divers , and i am now actively involved in running the organization			2
@entity56 's did n't stop his space walk a few years ago , @entity41 and i were talking about ways to raise funds for @entity35			0
he asked me if i thought i could push my racing chair across the country			0
my first thought : " if it would help @entity35 , i 'm in			0
" and now i have honored that commitment by combining my passion for " pushing " with my tremendous desire to support @entity67 , an organization i will be a part of for many years			0
in addition to giving back to @entity35 , i was motivated to encourage others to take on challenges and give back to individuals and organizations that have made a difference in their lives			0
i also wanted to build awareness for the potential of all persons with disabilities and disability sports			1
during my @entity9 experience in @entity16 , where 80,000 fans cheered for me and my fellow paralympians at each and every event , i was impressed with how the fans embraced us as athletes -- athletes first , @entity9 second			0
in doing the push across @entity30 , i wanted to help promote disability sports in the @entity30 and encourage people to view athletes with disabilities in the same way they view other athletes -- in other words , no differently			1
push across @entity30 was a phenomenal experience			0
for the most part , the weather was good , and of course , there were mountains to climb			0
but i was focused and knew why i was doing it and i knew this would be a defining moment in my life			0
i did it to prove i could and to encourage others to never give up , as well as to support @entity67 and to have a good time ! my theme song is " @entity112 " by @entity113			0
yep , for me , i made a promise to @entity41 i swore to remember , and this was it -- " no retreat , baby , no surrender ! " scoliosis has n't stopped top female golfer			0
