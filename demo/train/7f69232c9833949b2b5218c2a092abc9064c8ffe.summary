-- every two seconds , somewhere across @entity1 a customer takes delivery of a new car -- part of a consumer buying blitz that will see @entity1 add 21 million new cars , trucks and buses to its fleet total in 2014			2
short of a catastrophic economic downturn , a government edict against new car ownership , or draconian traffic congestion charges , a continuation of that growth rate means @entity1 will likely have a bigger motor vehicle fleet than the @entity18 by 2020			2
indeed , the combination of a low vehicle penetration rate -- only 85 vehicles for every 1,000 people in @entity1 , compared with more than 800 per 1,000 in the @entity18 -- and the consumer aspirations of high - income , urbanized households across @entity1 almost guarantees it			2
as many as five million of the 260 million - plus vehicles on @entity1 roads in 2020 will be plug - in hybrids or battery electric vehicles , while others will use fuel cells			2
many of the country 's taxis , trucks and buses will run on compressed natural gas			0
there will be multiple fuel - saving aids and financial incentives			0
petroleum demand but overwhelmingly , passenger cars will still run on gasoline and diesel fuel , which is why @entity1 demand for petroleum is the key factor in the global energy outlook for 2014 and beyond			1
@entity1 is already the world 's biggest energy consumer and must import 60 % of the crude oil it needs to meet its transport and refinery needs , as well as to fire some of its industries and power plants			1
much of the estimated 10.5 to 11 million barrels of oil that @entity1 consumes every day comes from @entity60 and other @entity62 suppliers , and many of the @entity62 crude carriers must pass through the @entity65 " choke point " between @entity67 and @entity68 en route to @entity1			1
that logistical vulnerability troubles @entity1			0
so while its transport sector 's oil demand is growing , @entity1 is trying to lessen its reliance on oil for power by putting greater emphasis on coal , nuclear , natural gas and renewable sources such as solar , wind , biomass and hydro power			1
already it has the world 's largest installed base of wind power ( 76 gigawatt at the end of last year ) , and is the dominant producer of photovoltaic modules for the solar power industry			1
diversified energy supply at home , @entity1 is pushing ahead with the search for and development of more domestic hydrocarbons , including unconventional resources such as shale gas , tight oil and coal - bed methane			2
at the same time , its focus on a diversified energy supply means it invests in and encourages oil and gas imports via pipelines from @entity104 , @entity105 and the new pipeline route from the @entity107 through @entity108			0
further afield , it is investing in @entity110 oil and gas assets , from shale fields in western @entity112 to heavy crude in @entity115 's @entity114			2
in the next few years , more liquefied natural gas ( @entity117 ) from @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 will enter the @entity1 energy equation , along with @entity105 lng from the remote @entity123 in northwest @entity124 via the @entity125 , the shorter but more hazardous shipping route that runs through @entity128 waters to the @entity129 and thence to the @entity130			0
all of this means that @entity1 , and not the @entity18 , will be a key target market for the world 's major oil exporters in future			1
@entity1 's oil import needs are growing , just as @entity120 's are declining on the back of its shale gas bonanza over the past five years and the more recent emphasis on oil production in places such as @entity144 's @entity143 field			1
@entity1 already has eclipsed the @entity18 as the top net oil importer			0
according to the @entity147 ( @entity147 ) , @entity1 's net oil imports in september were 6.3 million barrels a day , ahead of a net figure of 6.13 million barrels a day for the @entity18 it said this trend was likely to continue in 2014			1
overall the @entity18 will likely remain the world 's biggest oil user in 2014 , with the @entity147 expecting it to consume the equivalent of 18.7 million barrels a day			1
@entity1 's figure will be about 11 million barrels a day			1
auto love but that order could change over the next decade , if @entity1 's love affair with the motor car continues unabated			1
global passenger car sales next year will reach almost 75 million , according to a forecast earlier this month by the @entity161 @entity160 ( @entity162 )			0
when trucks and buses are included , the total will likely reach 85 million			0
between 23 and 24 million of those sales will occur in @entity1 , while the @entity18 will account for about 16 million vehicles in 2014 and peak at 17 million in 2017			0
in contrast , @entity1 demand may well grow to between 25 and 30 million vehicles a year later this decade			2
even though major @entity1 cities such as @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 have begun to introduce vehicle - use restrictions to combat traffic congestion and pollution , analysts expect the consumer action will simply move to other less - crowded venues			0
already , leading global carmakers like @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and their @entity1 joint venture partners are targeting second , third and fourth - tier cities where the car ownership growth opportunities may be greatest			0
in a study last year , management firm @entity190 said that apart from government restrictions and a growing used - car market , other factors that could impact on @entity1 's new car sales over the next decade include industry consolidation , improved public transport options and the growth of car - sharing and car rental businesses			1
at the same time , @entity190 said more @entity1 buyers were looking for bigger , better and more expensive vehicles such as sports utility vehicles			0
that will ensure @entity1 becomes the biggest player in the global energy - for - transport sector			0
it will also be the world 's biggest user of electric vehicles and a potential pioneer of fuel cells			1
in contrast to the @entity1 experience , car and light truck fuel use is declining sharply in the @entity18 a combination of fuel efficiency and changes to driving behavior means there will likely be a 25 % drop in light - duty vehicle energy consumption between now and 2040 , the @entity147 said in its 2014 annual energy outlook released on december 16 .			0

analysis : @entity1 's " love affair " with motor vehicles drives demand for oil
60 % of crude oil is imported to meet transport and refinery needs
