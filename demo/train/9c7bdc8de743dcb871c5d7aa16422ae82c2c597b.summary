or you could try a monastery for silent meditation ( such as the @entity171 , in @entity172 , @entity173 ; no telephone for obvious reasons )			0
absence of carol singers guaranteed			0
go to a party town this might seem counter-intuitive , but a good way to avoid the season of excess is to head somewhere it happens on a daily basis			0
