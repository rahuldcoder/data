after just three doses of an experimental drug , @entity6 -- whose parents had to launch a media campaign to get him the medicine -- is sitting up , doing homework and playing board games with his brothers , his mother said			1
just last week , @entity6 was so sick he could barely get out even a few words			2
he was in heart and kidney failure , and vomited blood several times an hour as his family held a vigil in the intensive care unit of a @entity22 hospital			0
@entity6 received doses of the drug brincidofovir wednesday , saturday , and tuesday , and tests showed the level of adenovirus in his blood went down from 250,000 copies per milliliter to 367 copies per milliliter			1
" we expect it will be out of his system by tuesday , " his mother , @entity31 , said friday			2
" i 'm beside myself with how effective this drug was so quickly			2
" already they 're seeing results of the waning virus in @entity6 's system			2
he no longer has bleeding in his stomach and intestines			0
before receiving brincidofovir , @entity6 was fighting for his life			2
the adenovirus was ravaging his immune system , left vulnerable by treatment for cancer , and the only available antiviral drug to treat it was n't working			0
in early february , @entity51 , the company that makes brincidofovir , refused to give @entity6 its experimental drug			1
but after reports by @entity55 and intense pressure from social media , @entity51 and the @entity58 came up with a plan to get the medicine to @entity6 and other patients who request it			1
drug company will give ailing 7 - year - old medicine that could save him traditionally , drug companies have not been allowed to use so - called " compassionate use " patients like @entity6 as study subjects , so helping them out has been pure charity work on behalf of the drug company			1
but the @entity58 allowed @entity51 to use data from @entity6 and others as part of its application to the @entity58 , helping to get the drug on the market faster			1
seven other adenovirus patients have inquired about being the next in line to get the drug , according to @entity80 , the president of @entity51 , and several of those patients have already received doses			1
even though the virus seems to be leaving @entity6 's body , his mother says his kidneys are still in danger			1
in february , his kidneys were just starting to recover from the damage of powerful chemotherapy			0
but then the adenovirus struck , and his doctors had no choice but to give him an antiviral drug that further damaged his kidneys			0
now that @entity6 is taking brincidofovir , he 's no longer taking the other drug that hurt his kidneys , but the damage was done : his kidneys still are n't working and he has to undergo dialysis three times a week			1
his mother worries he might be on dialysis the rest of his life			0
" what if he has to be on dialysis long - term ? if he could have gotten the brincidofovir earlier , it could have been avoided			0
that will always bother me , " she said			0
@entity6 's father says son faces ' long road to recovery ' she 's also worried about something else -- @entity6 's state of mind			2
as recently as last month , @entity6 had a " go get ' em " attitude about fighting his illness , his mother says			1
but now , even though he 's getting better , she says he seems to be exhausted after months of being sick and lacks motivation			0
" i have n't seen him smile lately , " she said			0
" i try to get him to chant every day , ' i 'm as good as new			0
