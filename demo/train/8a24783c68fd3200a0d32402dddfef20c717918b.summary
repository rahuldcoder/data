-- two of @entity3 's biggest clubs staged dramatic comebacks on tuesday as @entity5 rallied from 4 - 0 down to beat @entity7 7 - 5 in the @entity8 while struggling @entity10 heavyweights @entity9 drew 2 - 2 at @entity11 in @entity12 the results will have different impacts for both coaches , with manager @entity17 's position seemingly safe at @entity5 while @entity9 boss @entity18 will continue to face pressure as his side 's indifferent form goes on			1
in tuesday 's only top - flight league game in @entity10 , @entity11 led 2 - 0 shortly after halftime whereupon the under - fire @entity24 changed his tactical plan to good effect , switching from his favored 3 - 5 - 2 to a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 while also introducing @entity28 as a substitute			1
the former @entity31 player had an instant impact , teeing up a goal for @entity34 before @entity35 leveled the game 10 minutes from time , with the 20 - year - old 's seventh league goal of the season taking him to the top of the scoring charts			1
the point bought @entity18 a little more breathing space as the seven - time @entity45 champions moved into the top half of the table , yet they still trail league leaders and old rivals @entity49 by 14 points with just a quarter of the season gone			2
with @entity18 's position under constant scrutiny and club president -- and former @entity10 prime minister -- @entity57 having been sentenced to four years in prison for tax evasion , the start to @entity9 's season has been anything but easy			2
@entity17 has also been criticized after mixed recent results , and his team -- featuring 11 changes from saturday 's hard - fought win over lowly @entity67 -- went 4 - 0 down after just 37 minutes against another team stuck in the @entity70 's relegation zone			1
seconds before halftime , @entity71 scored the first goal of a special hat - trick , with his second coming six minutes into stoppage time to force extra-time			0
the @entity79 international 's his 120th - minute goal gave @entity5 a 6 - 5 lead , which was later extended by @entity83 striker @entity82 's second of the match			2
" the first set is for us , it was a tennis game today , " joked @entity17 afterwards			0
" there were so many turning points			0
the goal to make it 4 - 1 just before halftime was important , as was the miracle goal in the ( 90th ) minute			0
" @entity17 was forced to face disgruntled supporters at a stormy annual general meeting last week , where many fans were unhappy to hear him place qualification for the @entity98 above winning a trophy			0
the @entity100 have failed to pick up any silverware since 2005 but they have now made it into the quarterfinals of the @entity8 , on a night when fellow @entity70 sides @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 all exited the competition			0
meanwhile , @entity7 became the first team to score five goals in a non-qualifying round of either the @entity8 or @entity112 and lose a game			0
meanwhile , @entity115 league leaders @entity31 began the defense of their @entity118 title with a 3 - 0 victory at third division team @entity120			1
regular first - teamers @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 scored in the first - leg tie , while fellow @entity127 side @entity126 won 2 - 0 at @entity129			2
@entity132 holders @entity130 reached the third round with a 4 - 1 win at second division @entity136 , while fellow @entity138 sides @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 also went through .			1

@entity5 stage *stunning* rally as they come from 4 - 0 down to beat @entity7 7 - 5 in @entity8
@entity9 trail 2 - 0 at @entity11 before drawing 2 - 2 as coach @entity18 continues to feel pressure
@entity35 's late strike takes him to top of @entity12 scoring charts with 7 goals
@entity31 and @entity130 win opening matches of their @entity115 and @entity132 defenses
