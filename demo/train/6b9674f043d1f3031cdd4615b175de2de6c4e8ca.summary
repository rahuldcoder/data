-- the @entity2 crisis is not just a @entity3 crisis , or an @entity5 crisis , or now even a @entity7 crisis			2
it is an @entity9 crisis , too , a crisis that may thrust the @entity9 economy back into recession in 2012			1
if the @entity2 cracks up , many @entity13 banks who hold @entity2 - denominated bonds will discover that their bonds have lost value			1
the bonds wo n't fall to zero ( hold on a second for the reason why not ) , but they will lose enough value to play havoc with the bondholders ' capital			0
the banks will then either have to seek government help or stop their lending to businesses and consumers or both			0
the bank crisis will translate into a severe @entity13 - wide recession , just as the @entity9 financial crisis of 2008 created a severe recession in 2009			1
recessions that originate in the financial system cause more suffering and last longer than other kinds of recessions , a record painstakingly ( and painfully ! ) documented by @entity44 and @entity45 in their now - classic study , " this time it 's different			2
" the @entity47 represents a bigger economy even than the @entity9			1
if the euro cracks , and euro - holding banks fails , the pain will cross the @entity52 , as the pain of the @entity9 crash of 2008 crossed the @entity52 in the opposite direction			1
@entity13 financial institutions may lose the ability to repay @entity9 creditors , inflicting more losses on an already traumatized @entity9 financial system			1
collectively , the eurozone countries are far and away the largest foreign investor in the @entity9			1
if the eurozone economies slump , @entity9 will find it harder to raise capital for new projects and businesses			1
as a single economy , the @entity47 is @entity9 's largest trading partner			1
if it buys less , @entity9 exporters will suffer			1
this catastrophe could erupt almost literally at any minute			0
the @entity9 is not helpless to avert this crisis			1
in fact , the @entity9 could play an important role to avert the crisis , not only with money ( although money may be needed ) , but also by standing with those @entity13 willing to run the political risks to address the crisis			1
but the indispensable first step is to understand the crisis			2
many @entity9 perceive the euro crisis as a crisis of government deficits and government debt			1
that may have been true of @entity3 , but it 's certainly not true of @entity7 , the latest eurozone country to come under pressure in the financial markets			2
the @entity92 public debt is actually slightly larger than the @entity7 public debt , yet it is @entity7 bonds that the market is selling off			0
why ? if the euro cracks up , each country in @entity13 will be forced to ( re ) create a new currency of its own			1
in such a world , @entity92 bonds would probably rise in value , while @entity7 bonds would probably fall quite sharply			0
as the markets become more anxious that the euro may fail , they exert pressures that help rip the euro apart			2
let me present some very simplified math , using made - up numbers , just to help explain the idea			0
imagine you were to buy a @entity92 bond worth 1,000 euros			0
that bond now pays interest of 20 euros a year , equivalent ( let us say ) to $ 30 @entity9 the crisis hits			1
@entity92 creates a new deutschemark equal to 1 euro			2
your 1,000 euro bond is now a 1,000 new @entity123 bond , paying 20 new dm a year			2
but because the euro implicitly undervalued @entity92 currency , it is highly likely that the new @entity123 will rapidly appreciate against the dollar			2
in that case , your interest payment of 20 new dm would soon buy more dollars than your old interest payment of 20 euros			0
result : you are very happy to own @entity92 debt , despite the fact that @entity92 's total debt equals 83 % of gdp			2
now imagine you were to buy a @entity7 bond worth 1,000 euros			0
that bond currently pays interest of 30 euros a year , equivalent to ( say ) $ 45			0
but if the euro were to crack up , and @entity7 were to adopt a new @entity7 franc , that franc would probably decline against the dollar , because the current euro arrangement implicitly overvalues @entity7 currency			0
instead of buying $ 45 , your interest payment of 30 new francs might be worth only $ 30 , perhaps even less			0
result : you are increasingly nervous about holding @entity7 debt , despite the fact that @entity7 's total debt equals only 82 % of gdp			0
people say : " the @entity9 could become @entity13 if we keep accumulating debt			1
" yet @entity9 's debt burden is already higher than @entity7 's , and markets accept @entity9 debt with profound calm			1
the difference : it 's not that markets are worried that @entity7 ca n't pay its debts			0
they are worried that @entity7 wo n't pay its debts with euros			0
by contrast , nobody doubts that the @entity9 government can pay its debts with dollars			1
@entity9 has in the past faced the kinds of problems that @entity7 , @entity5 and the others face now			1
in the panic of 1893 , holders of @entity9 silver certificates ( the paper money of the time ) suddenly panicked that gold was going to become more valuable relative to silver			1
they began demanding gold in return for their paper , eventually draining federal gold reserves to the legal minimum			0
at that point , the federal government refused to release any more gold , and the country plunged into one of the worst depressions in @entity9 history , exceeded only by the @entity192 of the 1930s			1
the @entity9 in 1893 was a very rich country , and its debt burden was really quite light			1
the total resources of the country more than sufficed to pay its total debts , as the resources of @entity7 and @entity5 more than suffice to pay their debts			0
this was not a debt crisis , such as you might have today in a genuinely poor @entity204 country			0
it was a crisis caused by issuing debt in a currency ( gold back then , euros now ) that the issuing government did not control			0
@entity13 's options now basically reduce to two : either smash up the euro to restore each individual government with its own individual currency ( accepting a horrific recession along the way ) or else build a single new pan-european government to control the new pan-european currency ( with considerable inflation risk along the way )			1
neither option is hugely attractive			0
mistakes are easier to make than to undo			0
but the second choice does look seriously less ugly			0
because the @entity9 would suffer some of the pain from option one , it would be in the national interest to urge , and to contribute to support , the cost of option two			2
option two will involve transition costs			0
the original purpose of the @entity232 , to which the @entity9 remains the single largest contributor , was to ease monetary shocks			1
here at last is the biggest of them all			0
the @entity232 needs to involve itself actively , and @entity9 should not begrudge the cost of averting what otherwise could be a financial and economic catastrophe of global impact			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			2

@entity244 : @entity9 have a big stake in the outcome of the euro crisis
he says crisis could lead to a serious recession in 2012
@entity13 is @entity9 's largest trading partner and biggest investor in the @entity9
@entity256 : @entity9 should push for resolution of the crisis and provide money if needed
