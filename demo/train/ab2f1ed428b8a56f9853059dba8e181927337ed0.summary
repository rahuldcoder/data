the @entity1 and its campus police department are investigating a new report of a sexual assault in a campus residence as the college community struggles with how to move forward and improve its sexual assault policies after coming under national scrutiny			1
it 's the first report of a sexual assault on campus since the controversial and widely questioned @entity13 article , published in october , that depicted the brutal gang rape of a woman named @entity16			1
it 's also the only reported sexual assault in the university police public reports since the start of this 2014 - 2015 school year , according to a @entity0 review of records on its website			1
there are few details about this newest case			0
a statement sent to students on thursday said police were notified by the @entity29 " about a sexual assault incident reported to have occurred on january 30 , 2015 , in a residence hall on - @entity32			1
" the notice said police were notified on february 5 , six days after the incident			0
before the uproar over the @entity13 story , @entity1 policy allowed student victims to decide whether or not police were contacted after a sexual assault			1
since then , the university mandated a " zero - tolerance " policy , which has yet to be defined ; it 's unclear if the alleged victim in the latest assault participated in reporting it to police			2
university officials would not comment on those questions			0
this all comes as the university is trying to move forward from the fallout of the @entity13 piece			1
the story of @entity16 has been questioned and has prompted several investigations -- a police investigation , an internal review at @entity1 , and a @entity57 of @entity13 's reporting process			1
a lot is still unknown			0
here 's what we do and do n't know : what we know : some of the details in the story are not true			0
@entity66 police informed the university at the start of the spring semester that its investigation has found no evidence that the brutal gang rape happened at @entity74 fraternity , as the @entity13 story alleged			1
however , the police have not ruled out that @entity16 was raped -- possibly even gang raped , somewhere else , perhaps on a different day			1
the investigation is ongoing , and police are n't releasing any other details of what they 've found			0
@entity0 talked to several of @entity16 's friends who were with her the night she says she was allegedly attacked , and according to them , she told a different version of what happened that night			2
in the article , @entity16 said she was gang - raped by seven men while two men looked on			1
her friends said @entity16 told them she was forced to give oral sex to five men			2
@entity16 's @entity13 version said the perpetrator was a man she met at her job at the university pool			1
she told her friends it was someone she met in her chemistry class			0
she told her friends the assailant 's name , but no one by the name she gave attended the @entity1 , nor could anyone by that name be located in a database search across the @entity105			2
what we do n't know : we do n't know how much of the rest of the @entity13 story , including @entity16 's account , was correct			1
@entity16 has not talked to any member of the media since @entity13 issued an apology for its reporting , and the writer of the story has not spoken publicly since the apology , either			1
@entity57 is now fact - checking all of the details at the request of @entity13			0
what we know : some of the details in the @entity13 story that deal with the broader issue of how sexual assault reports are handled at @entity1 have been confirmed			1
for example , the university has admitted that it never expelled a single student for committing sexual assault , even when the student admitted it			1
the law firm @entity130 is now looking into how the university has historically handled sex assault claims			0
even before the @entity13 story , @entity1 was the subject of a @entity135 lawsuit filed by a woman who said she was drugged and raped by a fellow student , and that the university medical center lost some of the evidence , that a nurse did n't tell the truth about the woman 's injuries , and that a school administrator shared confidential information			1
in may 2014 , the @entity147 announced that it was investigating 55 schools , including @entity1 , for possible violations related to how it handles sex abuse claims			0
what we know : part of the independent investigation by @entity130 is looking at how @entity1 responded specifically to @entity16 's astonishing accusations against members of the @entity74 fraternity			2
according to @entity13 , @entity16 first reported her allegations to the university in the spring of 2013 , months after the alleged assault happened			1
the university did not call police because @entity16 did not want the police involved , @entity13 reported			1
however , many people on campus were well aware of @entity16 's shocking allegations			2
several people present at the annual " @entity170 " awareness event listened as @entity16 took to a podium and told her story to a crowd of hundreds in 2014			0
the police were not called until the account was published in @entity13 in november , causing national scrutiny and outrage			2
what we do n't know : it 's unclear if police were aware in detail of the allegations before the @entity13 story was published			2
the fraternity @entity74 expressed concern to police after members began to field questions from @entity13 about the allegation of a gang rape			2
it 's unclear exactly why that did not turn into a full police investigation			0
@entity1 officials were also involved in that conversation , @entity194 said			0
after being suspended for the rest of the fall semester , the fraternities were allowed to come back in the spring as long as they signed a new operating agreement which mandates sober fraternity brothers at parties , bans the serving of pre-mixed drinks , requires the use of guards at staircases , and other safety measures			0
@entity212 was the first to sign the new agreement , but two other fraternities accused the university of " bullying " them into signing it			0
then , days later , some sorority members were appalled to learn that their national chapters banned them from attending any fraternity bid night activities on saturday , january 31 , one of the biggest celebrations of the year in campus @entity224 life			0
from outside @entity66 , the @entity1 appears to be a campus in turmoil , struggling with how to move on from allegations that sexual assaults are rampant			1
but on campus many student leaders , like student council president @entity231 , agree that some of that discourse is good -- it will help them come up with the best plans for moving forward			0
but @entity231 also told @entity0 he 's concerned with the level of involvement the national fraternity and sorority organizations have had , and cautions that they do not speak for students on campus			0
â€‹ it 's clear from talking to students at @entity1 that many of them still see some merit to the criticisms of how the university handles sexual assault allegations			1
many also believe that something bad may have happened to @entity16 , although they are skeptical of the details in the @entity13 story			2
most students got back from winter break and returned to normal life at school			0
behind the scenes , leaders are working on new ways to tackle binge drinking and general campus safety			0
the university just adopted an ambassador program which provides sober escorts over the age of 21 for any student who needs help getting home			0
the " zero tolerance policy " pledged after the @entity13 story has yet to be defined , and some advocates are worried that it will have a chilling effect on reporting of sexual assault			1
@entity231 said he 's been working with state legislators who have proposed mandatory reporting , to make sure that any new proposals also do n't discourage women from coming forward .			0
