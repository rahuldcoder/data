-- the @entity1 was announced earlier at the @entity2 , but the phone itself was just unveiled in @entity5			1
it will take its place beside the @entity1 and will , at least initially , be available exclusively on @entity8			1
the device is similar to the @entity1 in many ways			1
its face is made from a 3.4 - inch @entity14 touchscreen , making it perfect for media consumption			1
additionally , the device is @entity18 - compliant , so it can quickly connect with tvs and other devices with @entity18 capabilities			2
but the most distinguishing feature of this device is n't its main display ; it 's a secondary , 1.8 - inch , @entity14 display			1
the " ticker " display is used to display information ranging from incoming calls to status messages			2
it 's also touch capable and , when the primary screen is being actively used , incoming messages are routed to it , so the primary activity is n't interrupted			0
the ticker can be activated separately from the main display using a unique grip sensor on the sides of the device			0
this allows users to discreetly look at relevant information without illuminating the considerably brighter main display			0
disappointingly , the @entity44 will ship with @entity45 2.1 , but @entity46 has assured it will be updated rapidly			0
the question is whether @entity46 will update to @entity45 2.2 or go straight to 2.3 ( @entity48 )			0
the @entity1 will be available for pre-order on november 11			2
it will be available in stores on november 18 -- one day before the @entity52 -- for $ 200 after a $ 100 mail - in rebate			0

@entity1 unveiled in @entity5
@entity57 will be available exclusively on @entity58
most distinguishing feature is the secondary , 1.8 - inch , @entity14 display
