the @entity0 -- hailed by some as the most important legislation in @entity4 history -- was signed into law 50 years ago wednesday			1
it was known as the " bill of the century			2
" but many @entity4 today probably could n't say exactly what the legislation accomplished			1
" it 's really the law that created modern @entity4 , " said @entity10 , author of " an idea whose time has come			1
" " its goal was to help finish the work of the @entity17 , 100 years after the war had ended , and to make the promise of legal equality for blacks and whites , even though actual equality is elusive to this day			2
" the law revolutionized a country where blacks and whites could not eat together in public restaurants under @entity28 laws , or stay at the same hotel			2
it outlawed discrimination in public places and facilities and banned discrimination based on race , gender , religion or national origin by employers and government agencies			2
it also encouraged the desegregation of public schools			2
" this did all of those things			2
it changed everything about ordinary life for black @entity4 all over the country , " @entity10 said			1
" i think when you try to explain to people today -- i have children 10 and 14 years old , and i do n't think they can really imagine a world like ( this ) existed before this law			2
" the act had the longest filibuster in @entity60 history , and after a bloody , long civil rights struggle , the @entity60 passed the act 73 - 27 in july 1964			1
it became law less than a year after president @entity66 's assassination			2
read the full act here here are a few surprising facts about how the @entity0 became law : 1			1
more republicans voted in favor of the @entity0 than democrats in the 1960s , @entity72 was divided on civil rights issues -- but not necessarily along party lines			1
" most people do n't realize that today at all -- in proportional terms , a far higher percentage of @entity69 voted for this bill than did @entity71 , because of the way the @entity81 were divided , " said @entity10			1
the @entity84 's @entity83 broke down the vote , showing that more than 80 % of @entity69 in both houses voted in favor of the bill , compared with more than 60 % of @entity71			2
when you account for geography , according to @entity83 's article , 90 % of lawmakers from states that were in the @entity90 during the @entity17 supported the bill compared with less than 10 % of lawmakers from states that were in the @entity96			2
@entity83 points out that @entity71 still played a key role in getting the law passed			0
" it was also @entity71 who helped usher the bill through the @entity101 , @entity60 , and ultimately a @entity71 president who signed it into law , " @entity83 writes			1
a fiscal conservative became an unsung hero in helping the @entity0 pass @entity108 's @entity107 rep. @entity107 had a conservative track record -- he opposed foreign and federal education aid and supported gun rights and school prayer			1
his district ( the same one now represented by @entity101 speaker @entity114 ) had a small @entity116 - @entity4 population			1
so he had little to gain politically by supporting the @entity0			1
yet he became a critical leader in getting the bill passed			0
his ancestors opposed slavery even before the @entity17 , and he 'd made a deal with @entity66 to see the bill through to passage			0
" the @entity124 does n't say that whites alone shall have our most basic rights , but that we all shall have them , " @entity107 would say to fellow legislators			0
later , he would play a key role in the @entity128 and the @entity129 and become part of the @entity131 , appointed by the @entity133 administration to investigate the 1967 race riots			0
@entity66 's widow , @entity135 , wrote him an " emotional " letter when he retired from @entity72 in 1972			0
" you made a personal commitment to president @entity66 in october 1963 , against all interests of your district , " she wrote			0
" there were so many opportunities to sabotage the bill , without appearing to do so , but you never took them			0
on the contrary , you brought everyone else along with you			0
@entity149 and @entity150 met for the first and only time during @entity60 debate on the act the two leaders met briefly on march 26 , 1964 , while they were both on @entity156 to hear debate on the 1964 @entity0			1
that brief encounter was captured by photographers			0
" well , @entity149 , good to see you , " @entity150 greeted @entity149 " good to see you , " he replied			0
known for his direct rhetoric in denouncing @entity4 's treatment of african - americans , @entity149 was a stark contrast to @entity150 , who preached tolerance and peace in achieving equal rights			1
some scholars say the two could have formed an alliance , as @entity149 moved away from the @entity172			0
but it never happened : @entity149 was shot and killed less than a year after their first and only encounter			0
@entity150 was assassinated in 1968			0
the act did n't help just black @entity4 women , religious minorities , latinos and whites also benefited from the @entity0 , which would later serve as a model for other anti-discrimination measures passed by @entity72 , including the @entity183 and the @entity184			1
under the @entity0 , women who had been fired because they became pregnant , or were not hired because they had small children , now had recourse			1
as a result of @entity189 , " male only " job notices became illegal for the first time			0
before the @entity0 , women made up less than 3 % of attorneys and less than 1 % of federal judges ; now they make up nearly a third of lawyers , according to the @entity196 , and three of the nine @entity199 justices are women			1
the @entity200 was also created by the law , giving women a workable " hammer " with which to shatter the glass ceiling			0
a segregationist congressman 's attempt to kill the bill backfired @entity208 's @entity71 rep. @entity207 was a staunch segregationist and strongly opposed the @entity0			1
@entity207 , who was chairman of the @entity209 , came up with many tactics to discourage the passage of the bill 's @entity189 , which would outlaw employment discrimination because of race , color , religion or national origin			0
when @entity207 added the word " sex , " the @entity101 reportedly laughed out loud			0
the ploy was @entity207 's attempt to quash support among the chamber 's male chauvinists on the grounds that the bill would protect women 's rights in the workplace , according to @entity229 in his book " the @entity231			0
" despite resistance , and complex motives , the act eventually passed , laying the groundwork for legal battles to ensure equal employment opportunities for women			1
and whether he intended to or not , @entity207 ended up helping to set the stage for modern feminism			0
the 1964 law did n't do much to address discrimination at the ballot box black men were granted the right to vote in 1870 under the 15th amendment ( women followed 50 years later )			2
yet many obstacles -- including literacy tests and poll taxes -- prevented most blacks in the @entity81 from casting ballots			0
just a few months before the @entity128 , the 24th amendment to the @entity4 @entity124 was ratified to remove poll taxes as a condition for voting in federal elections			1
all the 1964 @entity0 did was to mandate the same voting rules nationwide			1
it was n't until the following year that the @entity128 would suspend the use of literacy tests .			0

wednesday marks the 50th *anniversary* of the signing of the @entity0
" it changed everything about ordinary life for black @entity4 , " says @entity10
the act holds the record for *sparking* the longest filibuster in the history of the @entity60
