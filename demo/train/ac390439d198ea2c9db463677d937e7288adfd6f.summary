-- self - defense or murder ? that 's the question at the heart of the trial of @entity6 , a neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17 - year - old @entity7			1
monday marked the start of jury selection in @entity10 , @entity11 , where @entity7 was fatally shot on february 26 , 2012			1
the shooting put a national spotlight on @entity6 's hometown of @entity15 and sparked fresh debates about race relations and gun laws in @entity19			1
@entity6 is @entity20 ; @entity7 was african - american			1
an initial decision not to pursue charges against @entity6 led to the dismissal of the town 's police chief and the appointment of a special prosecutor , who accused the neighborhood watch volunteer of unjustly profiling and killing @entity7			1
@entity6 now faces a second - degree murder charge in @entity7 's death			1
he has pleaded not guilty and is currently free on $ 1 million bond			0
attorney : no imminent plans to put @entity6 on stand " we do n't need you to do that " prosecutors and defense attorneys agree on almost nothing about what happened that day			1
what 's clear so far is this : @entity7 left the home of his father 's girlfriend in @entity15 to get a snack at a nearby convenience store			1
as he walked back , carrying some candy and a soft drink , he and @entity6 crossed paths			1
earlier , @entity6 had called 911 to report a suspicious person in the neighborhood			1
a recording of that call includes a police dispatcher asking the volunteer , " are you following him ? " " yeah , " @entity6 replied			2
" ok , we do n't need you to do that , " the dispatcher said			0
@entity6 says he killed @entity7 , who was wearing a hoodie , in self - defense after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk			1
he suffered a fractured nose and cuts to the back of his head , according to a medical report by @entity6 's family doctor			2
@entity15 police initially questioned @entity6 and released him without charges			2
they said then there were no grounds to disprove his account that he 'd acted to protect himself			0
the case soon became the center of a national controversy , which continues some 16 months later , though at a lower intensity			2
his family has said @entity6 profiled the teen and crossed the line from neighborhood watch volunteer to vigilante			2
@entity88 , an attorney for @entity7 's family , has gone further , accusing @entity6 of murdering @entity7 " in cold blood			1
" experts : ca n't tell who is screaming in 911 calls " in the fight of his life " according to @entity88 , @entity7 was on the phone with his 16 - year - old girlfriend shortly before the shooting			1
the girl , who wishes to remain anonymous , says she heard someone ask @entity7 what he was doing and heard @entity7 ask why the person was following him			2
she then got the impression there was an altercation , during which an earpiece fell out of @entity7 's ear and the connection went dead , @entity88 said			2
@entity6 recently waived his right to a pretrial hearing under @entity11 's " stand your ground " law , which allows people to use deadly force when threatened regardless of where they are			2
his lawyers will claim self - defense			1
@entity6 himself could testify at trial			1
defense attorney @entity124 said he has no imminent plans to ask for a change of venue and would only do so if lawyers ca n't select a suitable jury			0
as jury selection began monday , 21 potential jurors were brought into the courtroom			1
four of them -- three women and one man -- were interviewed individually by attorneys , but there were no indications how either side felt about any of the potential jurors			0
from that group of 21 , one person was dismissed			0
the same group of 20 will be back on tuesday for more individual questioning			0
" if we can pick a jury in @entity10 , this is where the incident occurred and this is where the case should be decided , " @entity124 told @entity146 's @entity145			0
he also said the @entity6 defense fund has raised $ 85,000 in the past week and a half			1
media coverage of the case is expected to be intense			0
the case garnered so much attention that about a month after the shooting , president @entity159 spoke about it , saying the shooting required " soul - searching			0
" @entity6 's brother , @entity164 , has called on the state to drop the charges			0
" @entity6 lived in a community plagued by crime and was the first to come forward to help his neighbors , " @entity167 said last month			0
" @entity6 is a good , decent and honest man			0
it is now my honor to advocate for him			0
@entity6 is in the fight of his life quite literally			0
" authorities initially " did their job when they refused to charge someone with a crime who committed no crime , " he said			0
" in this country , you do n't charge someone why any crime solely to assuage the concerns of the misinformed masses			0
" gun , drug texts feature in new shooting evidence @entity0 's @entity191 and @entity193 's @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
