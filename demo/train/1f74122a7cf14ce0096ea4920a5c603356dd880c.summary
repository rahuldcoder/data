@entity0 does n't think the @entity1 owe their @entity3 peers anything			1
" whoever lent us money , we do n't owe them anything , " she says			0
" because , she says , @entity1 gave @entity3 culture , thinkers like @entity12 , @entity13 , " all the philosophers and mathematicians			1
" despite that , @entity0 will vote for @entity17 , the pro-austerity party in this weekend 's elections			1
" because there is no option , " she says			0
she is afraid of a return to the drachma -- the currency @entity1 had before it entered the euro -- the specter of which looms large over the vote			1
" it would be chaos if we went back to the drachma			0
" @entity0 is sitting outside @entity31 , a resplendent figure enjoying the country 's cafe culture in @entity35 , one of @entity38 ' most affluent areas			1
what do @entity1 elections mean ? @entity0 could be seen as one of the lucky ones			1
her husband , a lawyer , has passed away but she is able to support herself independently			0
yet " every day is disappointing , " she says			0
" [ the country ] has just collapsed			0
" she calls the situation " very sad , [ and ] bad			0
" the country must take an " honest fight " to corruption to bring itself out of the crisis , she says			0
@entity35 is populated by the city 's elite			2
it is a place where businessmen , politicians and actors gather to chew over the country 's political and economic crisis with cigars , espressos and cold beer			2
its wealthy clientele has ensured it is slightly shielded from the crisis , and the square remains buzzing with families , businessmen and the elderly , relaxing into the hot @entity38 evening			1
yet the area is far from immune			0
restaurant manager @entity70 says business has dropped by half since last year , and numbers of staff have been cut from 60 to 29			2
human cost of @entity1 's crisis this time last year the square would have been full , @entity70 says , because " it is the best area in the @entity81			1
" but nowadays , people are staying at home , he says ; they have no money			0
" this is a problem			0
" just down the road , past @entity38 ' central @entity87 , the focus of anti-austerity protests over the past two years , is @entity90 , an edgy area which was known as the " @entity92 " of the city before the crisis hit			1
here , restaurant worker @entity95 simply drops his thumb down when asked how business is			2
" business has dropped by over 60 % , " he says			2
but @entity95 says he will vote for @entity17 , because a swing to the left -- which has enjoyed as surge of support on the back of @entity1 ' despair after almost three years of austerity -- would take the country to hell , he says			1
austerity drives up suicide rate restaurant owner @entity110 says the area has changed , but he blames immigrants -- another ferociously debated topic on @entity1 streets -- for the country 's problems , rather than the financial crisis			1
his family has spent decades here , and he has seen it slump from its vibrant years in the early 1990s to an area he says now suffers from crime and is home to drug dealers			0
on sunday , @entity110 says , he will vote for extreme right wing party @entity125 , one of several fringe parties to benefit from voters ' dissatisfaction with traditional political groups in the last election			2
@entity1 citizens -- and the rest of the world -- will have to wait and see if those same extremist parties will play a key role in the country 's political future , be it inside or outside the euro .			1
