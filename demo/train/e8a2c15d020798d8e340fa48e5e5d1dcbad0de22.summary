-- " when i 'm riding , it is like flying			1
my feet do not touch the ground -- and the world and all the stresses that can come with being blind just disappear			1
" @entity7 has known her share of hurt , heartache and adversity , but it has not stopped her pursuing her dreams			1
a singer / songwriter , she has starred in her own stage musical , written a book and campaigned for guide dog awareness -- but she 's most at home on a horse			1
" it 's like floating			1
it 's magical , " the 40 - year - old tells @entity2 's human to @entity25			1
@entity27 gradually lost her vision from the age of eight due to a rare genetic disorder , becoming registered as officially blind by 16			1
" it 's kind of like a big snowstorm in my eyes , " she explains			2
" i see light and dark in my left eye and within that sometimes i see shadowy movement , but apart from that , not a lot			2
" while she is a published author and has her own record deal , there is one aim she has not fulfilled -- her goal of competing as a dressage rider at the highest level			1
" my dream was the @entity47 -- to compete at home , in my own country , for my country			1
it would 've been my absolute dream but unfortunately we did n't go			2
life was going smoothly -- she was riding well , singing beautifully and heading for a place in @entity59 's @entity58 team			2
but then @entity27 's dreams began to unravel at an alarming rate			2
in june that year , her competition horse @entity63 died of cancer before his replacement was diagnosed with " kissing spine , " which meant it was unable to take part in elite competition			1
worse was to come when her first guide dog was put to sleep			2
@entity27 's nightmare 12 months continued when a car she was traveling in -- on the way to pick up her new dog from the vet -- was hit by a truck whose driver fell asleep at the wheel			1
@entity27 suffered impact injuries to her chest and her spine was put out of place			2
she escaped without any broken bones but the accident ended her hopes of taking part at @entity47			1
" i decided after that year of just horror , it was just an unlucky year , " @entity27 says philosophically			1
" lots of people have them but it seemed like everything came at the same time			2
" i was very , very disappointed , very , very sad			2
it was the one time in my lifetime , the @entity93 was going to be in @entity95 and it looked like being such a beautiful , beautiful event			2
" with her dreams crushed , @entity27 may have been forgiven for wanting a period of moping and introspection			2
instead , she did what she does best -- she got back on the horse			2
aided by a new guide dog , @entity104 , a labradoodle who she describes as the " number one man in her life , " she began to regain her confidence			0
slowly but surely after a year out of the saddle , she began to get her balance back , taking short rides every day			1
once the confidence had returned , it was time to find a partner -- a new horse			0
@entity27 , who is now in @entity119 training with experienced coach @entity120 , describes the process as " like speed dating but without the bell			0
" " it was quite an experience , " she says			0
" it 's like meeting your future husband			0
" i was sitting on new horses in new environments , it 's quite difficult			0
" it was through a recommendation by a former trainer that @entity27 traveled to @entity135 to meet the horse she would eventually fall in love with			0
" this horse is really , really special , " was the thought racing through her mind as she sat on @entity140 for the first time			0
" he 's an absolute gentleman			0
if he were a man , i would marry him			0
" while both took their time to get used to each other , with @entity148 ( or " kit " as she calls him ) slowly realizing his rider could not see , their progress has been immeasurable			1
" he 's a really good guy and even the short time we 've been together , i 've really begun to trust him , " @entity27 says			0
" i think he 's getting the sense that there is something wrong with that person -- she ca n't see , she does bump into me sometimes -- but he 's very accepting of that			0
" i really believe that horses understand i can not see			0
they are very sensitive creatures			0
" the two are now working together in a bid to qualify for the @entity166 in @entity167			1
such an achievement would be astonishing given her accident -- but her determination to succeed in dressage is obvious to all who have met her			1
having started riding at the age of three , @entity27 competed in show jumping until her mid-teens			1
" when my eyesight got to the point that show jumping and eventing were becoming a dangerous sport , i decided to look for a really good dressage trainer that could take me on and start me from scratch , " she recalls			1
" i 've never actually seen dressage being performed			1
when i could see , i was obviously very interested in all the things that involved speed and obstacles			0
" dressage , which @entity27 describes as " ballet with horses , " was originally used to train the animals during the renaissance period			1
the " piaffe " is a signature move where the horse jogs on the spot , while there are also the " flying changes " -- where it skips on alternate legs			0
" it is all about harnessing the horse 's energy and channeling it in different ways , and the control comes from your seat , " @entity27 explains			0
" the horse has to be incredibly supple and incredibly strong			0
it 's all gentle movements -- you 're never going to get half a tonne of horse to do something by being strong			0
you have to ask them nicely			0
" at the @entity93 and @entity58 , there are two controlled rounds , where competitors are marked out of 10 and awarded a percentage score , before showcasing their freestyle routine			0
@entity27 's favorite music is swing , with the big band sound of @entity223 enough to get her " @entity224			0
" but while the swing will hopefully turn to samba in time for @entity167 , @entity27 says she still faces a real challenge to qualify for the @entity59 team			1
" we are working as hard as we can , " she says			0
" there 's a lot of good people out there wanting to be in the @entity59 team so our goal is to work as hard as i can and train as hard as i can			0
" although we did n't do @entity95 , hopefully with a bit of luck , we 'll earn our place on the team and we 'll fly to @entity167			1
