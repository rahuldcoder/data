-- when @entity2 celebrated the 20th anniversary of its independence from the former @entity5 last month , it did so in a capital city that has been radically transformed over the past two years			1
almost 20 new buildings -- and a similar number of statues , fountains and monuments -- are being built around the center of @entity13			1
the transformations are being made as part of a project called @entity13 2014 , aimed at rebuilding a city that lost many of its landmarks in a 1963 earthquake			1
the centerpiece , in place in time for the anniversary celebrations on september 8 , was a 22 - meter statue , called warrior on a horse			1
it is widely understood to depict @entity29 , but has not been officially named as such because of a long - running dispute with @entity31 , to whom the ancient king is a national hero			0
there is also a new museum of @entity36 , which opened on @entity37 , a triumphal arch , a new foreign ministry building , a new constitutional court , a new national theater and a new archaeological museum , among other buildings			1
country profile : @entity2 the official cost of the project is 80 million euros , although critics claim the final bill could be as high as 500 million euros , according to the online newspaper @entity48			2
@entity13 2014 has divided @entity2 , some of whom say a country with more than 30 % unemployment , according the @entity54 data , should not be spending so much on a building project			1
@entity56 , who runs an independent tourism website travel2macedonia.com.mk , said : " the project splits the people , like a river between the coasts , some of them are for it , while others are not			0
" the controversy for the project is mostly that @entity2 belongs to a group of countries with high unemployment level			2
" however , @entity71 , the government 's head of tourism , said : " @entity13 already has a totally new look from it did two years ago , and by 2014 it will have even more new buildings			1
even in this global economic crisis we are building , not only buildings and attractions but also a new infrastructure and accommodation capacity , like brand new airports , roads and hotels			0
" at first there was misunderstanding from people , but now they are seeing that it is really beautiful for people who live in @entity13 as well as for travelers			2
" what do you think of the new buildings ? send in your images others question the taste of classic antiquity buildings and bronze statues			0
one @entity2 who asked not to be named said : " i try to avoid the city center now			1
it has turned into a theme park			0
wherever you turn there are new bronze statues and sculptures			0
it 's as if they 're trying to create a national identity			0
" i would have thought in the 21st century we should be building something modern , urban and contemporary			0
i ca n't imagine any other city building a triumphal arch in the 21st century			1
" regardless of personal opinions of the project , @entity13 2014 and other infrastructure investments do appear to be helping @entity2 to attract foreign tourists			1
@entity71 said there had been a 25 % increase in foreign tourists visiting @entity2 in the first seven months of this year , compared with the same period last year			1
@entity56 said : " whether it was due to @entity13 or not , this was first season that i 've actually seen mass groups of foreign tourists with a travel guides in the downtown and the @entity128			2
" this is the first year when @entity13 received more tourists than @entity131 , the leading tourism destination of @entity2			1
" official government statistics show a steady increase in foreign tourists arriving in @entity2 from 99,000 in 2001 to almost 262,000 last year			1
while the majority come from neighboring countries , there has been an increase in recent years from further afield , including @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
@entity71 said : " we have a lack of opportunities for mass market tourism because we do n't have a coastline , but we do have beautiful lakes and mountains and interesting culture and history			0
" he said the country was also developing its gambling tourism market , with a number of casino hotels			0
the government has recently introduced policies to boost tourism including a reduction in sales tax on hotels and catering from 18 % to 5 % and subsidies to attract tour groups from certain countries			0
@entity56 said : " the previous years , usually the tour operators have been including @entity2 as a part of wider @entity172 tours and have n't stayed in @entity2 longer than a day			2
starting from last year , the number of nights spent in @entity2 has increased			2
" regardless of money spent on grand projects and infrastructure , national pride has been given a boost from a quarter that no politician could plan			0
@entity2 's 20th anniversary celebrations coincided with the national basketball team unexpectedly reaching the semi-finals of the @entity185 championships			1
" honestly , i have n't seen the people of @entity2 so happy and proud before , " said @entity56			2
" @entity187 were all over , on people , on cars , on windows			0
people have replaced their economic problems with a smile and happiness			0

@entity13 2014 is a *multi-million* euro project to rebuild city center
triumphal arch , warrior statue and new museum opened for @entity2 's 20th anniversary celebrations
