-- days ahead of another anniversary of the bloody @entity3 uprising -- and six decades after @entity4 took over the region -- @entity7 government officials stressed the need for " stability " in the disputed territory while promising " reform " and infrastructure upgrades			1
president @entity13 focused on spurring economic growth and increasing @entity16 's investment in the region sunday during a speech to @entity20 's delegation to the @entity7 national legislature			1
" meticulous efforts must be paid to the tasks of reform , development and stability to ( bolster ) development and maintain perennial stability in @entity20 , " @entity13 said , according to a report in the state - run @entity24 news agency			1
these remarks were among a host of tibet - centric announcements sunday -- four days before march 10 , which will mark 52 years since the start of the largest , and deadliest , clashes between independence - minded @entity3 and forces aligned with the central @entity4 government in @entity16			2
that day in 1959 , about 300,000 people surrounded @entity42 palace , according to the advocacy group @entity43 , fearful the @entity44 would be forcibly taken to @entity16			0
tensions ratcheted up further and eventually exploded into violence , with @entity20 estimating more than 85,000 @entity3 were killed by @entity7 armed forces in a few days			1
the @entity44 , then 23 , escaped on horseback to @entity48			0
establishing a home in the hill town of @entity51 , he also has travelled the world giving speeches , attended meditation conferences and met people from @entity56 to @entity58 stars to heads of state -- all while remaining head of @entity20 's government - in - exile			2
in 2009 , 20 years after winning the @entity62 , he said the @entity7 government has made life " @entity65 " for @entity3 ever since that foiled rebellion			2
yet , even as the @entity44 has said @entity20 desires autonomy and cultural continuity but not necessarily full independence from @entity16 , @entity7 's central government has viewed him as a troublemaker intent on destroying the nation 's sovereignty			1
combating " anything that could sabotage stability " was a key theme sunday for @entity77 , the @entity16 - backed @entity78 chief of the @entity3 region , according to another @entity24 report			1
@entity77 said there were " very grave challenges " from separatists in @entity20 , 60 years after what he called the " peaceful liberation " of @entity20 by @entity4 forces led by @entity87			1
he warned that @entity20 " will not develop " economically without stability			2
" the majority of the @entity3 people are unwilling to suffer from social unrest , " @entity77 said			0
@entity13 and @entity77 both touted a desire to jump - start development in the remote area , and several other officials offered specific proposals to that end			0
among them , @entity7 's transportation minister @entity97 said sunday that all counties in @entity20 would have paved roadways by 2015			1
while not giving a currency amount for the project 's cost , he said @entity16 would double its current investment -- so that almost all villages would be accessible via highways by adding 12,000 kilometers ( 7,500 miles ) of blacktop , over the next five years			0
a network of " expressways , " too , should soon link the @entity3 cities of @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 , @entity97 said in the @entity24 report			0
another official told the news agency that a new train line -- also to be built by 2015 -- would drastically cut travel time between the capitals of the provinces of ethnic @entity20 and @entity123			0
the creation of a new railway between @entity126 in northwestern @entity128 province and @entity129 in @entity123 would mean travelers between @entity111 , @entity20 , and @entity131 , @entity123 , would have to traverse 1,000 fewer kilometers ( 621 miles ) in track than they now do			0
" the new railway line will play a significant role in boosting the economic development in the country 's western regions and promoting exchanges among different ethnic groups , " said @entity133 , vice governor of @entity128 .			0
