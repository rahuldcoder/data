@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 victims of sexual abuse are " disgusted " by a newly revealed letter in which a @entity9 official expresses " serious reservations " about requiring bishops to report suspected abuse by priests to police , they said wednesday			1
abuse survivors will question the cardinal leading a special papal delegation to @entity1 about the letter , they said			2
" we are disgusted by details revealed in the letter			2
many of our members just ca n't take this in and have been deeply affected by the revelations , " survivors and @entity23 spokeswoman @entity22 told @entity2			0
the 1997 letter from the @entity9 's envoy to @entity5 warns bishops to follow church law in investigating cases of suspected child sex abuse by priests			1
the envoy expresses " serious reservations " about requiring that such cases be reported to the police			0
the @entity9 has called the letter " deeply misunderstood " since it was made public by @entity5 state broadcaster @entity39 this week			1
@entity2 obtained a copy of the letter on tuesday from a lawyer who represents the @entity9			2
a spokesman for the @entity45 said they have since 1996 had a policy of reporting suspected abuse to the police			1
victims of abuse are due to meet @entity53 on friday , they said			2
he was appointed by pope @entity55 last year to work with the @entity5 church after revelations of widespread abuse by priests and cover - ups by their superiors			1
" the meeting with the cardinal could n't have come at a better time -- we will be letting him know exactly how we feel , will be putting many questions and will be demanding answers , " @entity22 said			0
a spokeswoman for the cardinal declined to confirm he would meet victims on friday , citing the sensitivity of the issue			1
the two - page letter , written by @entity75 @entity74 , was sent to bishops in @entity1 in response to a document they had sent to the @entity9 that recommends mandatory reporting of cases of suspected child sex abuse by priests			1
after studying the @entity5 bishops ' document , the @entity9 's @entity84 said it contains " procedures and dispositions which appear contrary to canonical discipline and which , if applied , could invalidate the acts of the same bishops who are attempting to put a stop to these problems			1
" if such procedures were followed by the bishops and there were cases of eventual hierarchical recourse lodged at the @entity9 , the results could be highly embarrassing and detrimental to those same diocesan authorities , " @entity74 wrote			0
" in particular , the situation of ' mandatory reporting ' gives rise to serious reservations of both a moral and a canonical nature , " he added			1
@entity39 said it had received the letter from an @entity5 bishop and that @entity110 officials in the country had previously refused to release it			1
the @entity39 program " @entity116 ? " said pope @entity55 is now doing more than any previous pope has done to tackle abuse , but asked whether that has been enough			0
@entity118 , a spokesman for @entity110 bishops , said the pope had twice in the past year urged them to follow procedures the church established to protect children			1
" also the @entity130 maintains its policy of mandatory reporting of abuse allegations , " @entity118 said , calling on the @entity5 government " to introduce law which facilitates mandatory reporting of allegations of sex abuse			1
" @entity134 , the lawyer representing the @entity9 in the @entity135 , said in a statement that " the letter in question has been deeply misunderstood			2
" he said its primary purpose " was to help ensure that bishops who discipline their priests for sexual abuse did so in a manner that would ensure that the priest not avoid punishment based upon technical grounds			0
this is precisely the opposite of what has been reported in many press accounts			0
" the letter also raised questions about the canonical validity of what @entity154 called the " study document " produced by the @entity5 bishops ' conference			1
" as such , contrary to media reports , the letter did not constitute a rejection of the position of the conference , " he said			0
" finally , and again in stark contrast to news reports , the letter nowhere instructed @entity5 bishops to disregard civil law reporting requirements			1
" @entity9 spokesman @entity171 said the letter rightly insists that canon law be respected to ensure that guilty priests have no grounds for recourse			2
" we need to remember that the letter was written before the norms of 2001 , " which clarified the matter , he said			0
but victims ' and survivors ' groups in @entity1 said the letter proves the protection of pedophile priests from criminal investigation was not only sanctioned by @entity9 leaders but ordered by them			2
one in four , an organization representing victims of sexual abuse in @entity1 , said the letter raised questions about the inquiry into child sex abuse by clerics in @entity1			2
the @entity197 raised similar concerns			0
" in the mid 1990s , @entity5 bishops wanted to start telling law enforcement about horrific child sex crimes , " the group said in a statement			1
" top @entity9 bureaucrats told them no. that 's what this newly released letter shows			0
we ca n't help but wonder how many other similar documents -- in which the @entity9 thwarts local efforts to combat abuse -- remain hidden in church records across the world			0
" " it 's certainly an embarrassment for the @entity9 , " said @entity217 @entity9 analyst @entity216 " it 's another confirmation that , in the late 1990s , there was deep ambivalence in the @entity9 about how far they should go in terms of reporting priestly sex abuse to civil authorities			0
" but , he added , " it 's not a smoking gun because it is not a directive			1
this is one @entity9 official giving his opinion			0
it is not a policy document			0
" current church policy calls for such cases -- learned about outside the confessional -- to be reported to police , he said			0
@entity2 's @entity239 and journalist @entity240 contributed to this report .			0
