for many people , any interest in the resurgence in @entity3 volcanic activity this year is now a distant memory			1
however , an eruption from @entity7 that began on august 31 continues to this day and has now emitted the most lava of any volcano in @entity3 since 1947 and shows no sign of stopping			1
to give some sense of the scale , the volcano has now spewed so much lava to the surface that it would fill @entity18 stadium to the brim more than 500 times over			1
and the total area of impact is over 28 square miles			2
unlike a lava flow that is currently destroying homes in @entity25 , however , the lava in @entity3 is flowing in an uninhabited area and has only provided stunning visual effects that have been captured by many photographers			1
however , toxic gas released is causing respiratory discomfort to people in nearby towns , and has even triggered pollution warnings in other countries , including @entity35 , and measurable pollution peaks in the @entity37			1
so far , however , the eruption has not caused any problems from ash clouds because it is erupting beyond the ice cap			1
however , this could change at any time			0
the caldera at the top of the volcano is dropping every day , as magma flows out from below			1
this is being monitored by a high - precision gps instrument placed there by gutsy scientists of the @entity51			0
the subsidence is not smooth , but lurches down in jumps coinciding with earthquakes occurring beneath the surface			0
this subsidence marks a slow collapse of the caldera , a process that often ends with an eruption			1
there are hundreds of metres of ice within the caldera , so any eruption would lead to the production of ash , once it melts its way through the ice cap ; melting ice interacts with the magma , turning to steam and exploding the magma into fragments of ash			1
if this occurs , the eruption may well affect some flights			1
it would also cause destructive flooding from melting of the ice			0
however , we should not see any repeat of the massive airspace closure in @entity83 in 2010 , the biggest since @entity84 , following the eruption of the @entity86			2
that eruption stranded millions of travellers and cost the industry a massive sum			2
one key difference between then and now is that there is no longer an aviation " zero tolerance " policy to ash			0
this means that aircraft are now allowed to fly in areas containing low particle concentrations , and various efforts such as a collaboration of 26 @entity83 institutes called @entity104 , mean that models of ash concentration have been much improved since 2010			0
moreover , the ash produced in 2010 was especially fine , allowing it to stay aloft for a long time			0
the weather at the time also conspired against civil air authorities and travellers , with dry air and consistent northerly winds causing the ash to spread deep into @entity83			2
to be sure , there is a small chance of a much more significant eruption			2
@entity7 has had huge eruptions in the past , bigger even than the 1783 - 84 @entity118 eruption that led to a long - lived fog over much of @entity83 , which contributed to extreme low winter temperatures and many deaths			1
however , the frequency of such large eruptions is low -- separated by hundreds of years on average			0
that said , the timing of the next big one may have been brought forward by the shrinking of the ice caps due to climate change			0
the associated reduction of pressure in the mantle beneath the crust has caused magma generation rates to approximately double over the last century			0
but the picture here is not 100 % clear cut as the altered stress state of the crust may mean that more magma freezes beneath the ground , rather than erupting			0
even without a huge eruption , threats remain from the continued possibility of large floods from meltwater , with potential risk to human life			2
the highlands north of the @entity151 glacier therefore remain closed to the general public			0
taken overall , there remains a possibility of a significant ash eruption in @entity3 that may well impact some flights			1
however , despite all the risks , it is still unlikely we will witness a repeat of the travel chaos that brought @entity83 airspace to a standstill in 2010 .			0
