-- the phrase " organic farming " was coined in 1940 by @entity3 , a @entity4 author and @entity6 athlete who helped launch the organic movement			1
joined by fellow organic pioneers like @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , he championed farms as natural ecosystems , and railed against chemical fertilizers and pesticides			1
" the farm itself must have a biological completeness , " he wrote			0
" it must be a living entity ... which has within itself a balanced organic life			2
" those words still resonate with many farmers and shoppers today , however , they were drowned out for decades by famine			2
@entity28 's human population grew 293 percent in the 20th century -- compared with an average of 22 percent each of the previous nine centuries -- and farmers could n't keep up			1
as hunger spread , an @entity35 agronomist named @entity36 came to the rescue in the early 1940s , using man - made pesticides , fertilizers and crossbred crops to start the @entity41 , which saved countless lives and won him the 1970 @entity44			1
@entity0 : how to cut costs when shopping at the farmers market it also highlighted a common critique of organic farming : it 's already hard to feed billions of people , even without rules against spraying chemicals or swapping genes			1
@entity36 's methods often raised yields while reducing acreage , and it seemed for years he 'd proven the organic movement wrong			2
but " chemical farming , " as lord @entity3 called it , lost some luster when synthetic pesticides and fertilizers were linked to environmental ills like cancer , blue baby syndrome , dying eagles and dead zones			1
ecologists warned of gene pollution from genetically modified organisms , and overuse of livestock antibiotics was widely blamed for drug - resistant " superbugs			0
" this created an opening for organic farming in the late 20th century , and today there are an estimated 1.4 million organic farms worldwide , including some 13,000 certified in the @entity80 yet despite these gains , organic farms still struggle to match the output of conventional ones -- no small detail since there are now about 6.9 billion people on @entity28 , three times the 1940 population			1
and with that number forecast to hit 9 billion by 2050 , the future of organic farming remains unclear			1
@entity0 : farms of @entity80 from the 1930s and ' 40s it seems especially murky during economic dips like the recent recession , when higher - priced products of all kinds tend to suffer			0
but does organic food 's premium price translate into any real health or environmental benefits ? critics like @entity103 do n't think so -- the conservative author and researcher has compared " organic - food fanatics " to the terrorist group @entity107 , and wrote a book in 2006 called " @entity109 " that , according to his website , " strips bare organic myths			2
" while supporters say organic farming merely reveals the true cost of food , @entity103 and other critics say it makes food unaffordable			1
aside from supporting synthetic pesticides and fertilizers , they 've focused their ire lately on critics of genetically modified organisms			1
" for nearly a decade these agri - extremists have attempted to totally block agricultural biotechnology , " @entity103 wrote in 2003 , calling @entity126 " the most important and critically needed agricultural advance in human history			0
" a brief history of organic farming early farmers had no choice but organic farming , and they still achieved some major milestones over the years , like taming the first grains in @entity138 or turning a thin grass called teosinte into plump , protein - packed corn			1
agriculture has stayed largely organic for most of its 10,000 - year history , from the first @entity145 plots to the plantations of colonial @entity80			2
some plants would control pests and soil quality naturally , and humans helped by rotating their crops ; if extra fertilizer was needed , manure usually filled in			0
but some farmers used toxic additives as early as 4,500 years ago , when @entity156 dusted crops with sulphur to kill insects			2
within a few centuries , the @entity161 were killing lice with heavy metals like arsenic and mercury , a strategy later applied to crop pests			0
@entity0 : where to find coupons for organic or natural products @entity170 remained king of bug killers from medieval times up to the mid- 1900s , when science found something more effective			0
@entity176 had been created in 1874 , but it was overlooked as an insecticide until 1939 , when @entity179 chemist @entity178 made a world - changing discovery that won him a @entity44			0
@entity183 chemists had already invented a process by then for synthesizing ammonia to make nitrogen fertilizers , for which they also won @entity44			0
@entity36 then mixed these and other modern tactics to fight famines in @entity189 , @entity190 and the @entity191 , securing his own place in history			0
meanwhile , a rival revolution still simmered below the surface , advocating ancient tools like compost and cover crops			0
it was led in the @entity80 by magazine magnate and @entity201 founder @entity9 , who popularized organic farming in the 1960s and ' 70s as environmental attitudes were already in flux			1
when @entity207 officially defined " organic " in 1990 and set up national certification rules , it quickly triggered an organic bonanza			0
@entity211 - certified acreage grew by an average 16 percent a year from 2000 to 2008 , and still grew 5 percent in 2009 even amid the recession , points out @entity80 @entity214 spokeswoman @entity213			0
" i 'm no forecaster , " she says , " but i 'd have to say there 's a strong demand for it , and i would expect that to continue			0
