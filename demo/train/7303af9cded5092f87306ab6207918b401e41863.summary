@entity0 -- although the @entity4 narrowly avoided an unprecedented default following congressional approval of a last - minute compromise plan to raise the debt ceiling , @entity3 's leading credit rating agency wednesday downgraded @entity4 sovereign debt after putting it on negative watch last month			2
the @entity12 , which lowered the @entity4 to @entity13 last november after the @entity14 decided to continue loosening its monetary policy , announced a further downgrade to @entity13 , indicating heightened doubts over @entity19 's long - term ability to repay its debts			0
it said the gloomy assessment -- much lower than the @entity23 ratings given by the so - called " big three " @entity26 agencies @entity27 's , @entity28 , and @entity29 's -- was inevitable given the level of market concern generated by the stalemate between @entity33 and @entity34 over the debt ceiling			1
" the squabbling between the two political parties on raising the @entity4 debt ceiling reflected an irreversible trend on the @entity4 ' declining ability to repay its debts , " @entity36 chairman @entity35 told @entity1			1
" the two parties acted in a very irresponsible way and their actions greatly exposed the negative impact of the @entity4 political system on its economic fundamentals , " he said			0
ironically , @entity36 's move could hurt not just the @entity4 but also @entity3 , the largest foreign owner of @entity4 debt with holdings worth almost $ 1.2 trillion			1
" our downgrade simply reflects reality , " @entity35 said			1
" our rating did n't cause @entity3 to lose any money --- it was the inappropriately high ratings for the @entity4 by @entity26 agencies that had led @entity3 to make risky investments in @entity4 debt			1
" observers say @entity3 , whose foreign exchange reserves now stand at $ 3.2 trillion , has had little choice but to buy @entity64 bonds			0
" there are n't that many other markets that are as deep or as liquid as treasuries , " said @entity65 , an economic analyst with @entity67 in @entity0			0
" when they accumulate reserves , this is the only place they can put them			0
" the privately held @entity36 , founded in 1994 to rate @entity3 companies , attracted worldwide attention last july when it published its first sovereign credit ratings and , citing growing deficits in the developed world , ranked @entity3 higher than the @entity4 and @entity81			1
@entity36 now rates 67 countries and aims to more than double the number by the end of this year			2
its ambition to become an alternative to the " big three " suffered a setback , however , when the @entity89 refused to recognize its rating because of the commission 's inability to supervise the @entity0 - based agency			2
@entity35 , who worked as a civil servant and a @entity96 accountant before taking the helm at @entity36 , is quick to defend his firm 's independence and objectivity			2
he points to what he calls @entity26 agencies ' " double standard " in rating the @entity4 and @entity105 economies to underscore the global need for a newcomer like @entity36			1
" people are used to credit ratings issued by the ' big three , ' but the financial crisis has clearly proved them wrong , " @entity35 said			0
" they can no longer shoulder the responsibility of rating the world			0
" " that 's the role we are striving to play , " he added .			0

grade of a is much lower than those of " big three " @entity26 agencies
@entity36 chairman says both @entity33 , @entity34 were irresponsible
" our downgrade simply reflects reality "
privately held agency was founded in 1994
