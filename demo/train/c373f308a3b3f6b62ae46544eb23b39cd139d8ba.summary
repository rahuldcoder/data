-- back in 2010 , one of us -- @entity2 -- was faced with the question of whether to shake the president 's hand			1
and , despite having been invited to the @entity7 , he decided not to			0
why ? because the families and communities of 11 million @entity11 residents were still waiting years for president @entity12 to fulfill his promise of immigration reform			1
and they are still waiting , and have been left feeling betrayed by the failure of this administration to act			1
the meeting to discuss @entity11 immigration policy in 2010 followed what was dubbed the " @entity22 " walk by four immigrant college students , including @entity24 , from @entity25 to @entity26 to call attention to the plight of the undocumented in the @entity11			1
the 1,500 mile walk took place as the number of deportations was hitting historic highs , numbers that have resulted in some 2 million immigrants being deported			1
why are we still waiting for change ? the recent election results are sufficient proof of the folly of the @entity12 administration 's approach			1
after all , the @entity44 determined in june 2013 that immigration reform would boost economic output and could help cut federal budget deficits by $ 197 billion over the next 10 years			1
but just as important as the lost economic benefits of the failure to act is the human cost			0
in our ongoing research on undocumented youth and their mothers living in @entity55 , we find harrowing patterns of fear , exploitation and dehumanization			0
denying opportunities for lawful status results in barriers to employment , physical and social mobility , education and health , and the lack of opportunities has a particularly troubling impact on immigrants ' mental and emotional well - being			1
true , the @entity72 , or @entity72 , has helped those young adults who are eligible			0
but our research suggests their families need relief from deportation , too , and can not afford to continue waiting for the president to deliver on his promises			2
the reality is that every single day there is a human cost : separated families , deteriorating health , childhood trauma and economic insecurity			0
these human costs in turn have ripple effects that chip away at the enormous contributions that immigrants make to our economy and communities			0
take the case of " @entity96 , " an 18 - year - old immigrant who arrived in the @entity11 with his parents from @entity99 when he was 2			0
in spite of @entity72 , which granted @entity96 and other young people like him a temporary work permit and driver 's license , the benefits of this program did not extend to his undocumented mother battling breast cancer , nor his father who was unable to find employment that would afford him health benefits			2
@entity96 recently shared with us that at the end of last month , ineligible for health insurance and unable to afford the medical attention she needed and deserved , his mother passed away			0
" we live in a world so spiteful some of us could fall off and no one would notice , " @entity96 had told us before his mother died			0
we send our condolences to @entity96 's family and loved ones			2
but sadly , his is not an isolated case ; communities across the nation are losing people every day , not just through government inaction , but through policies that are actively separating families through detention and deportation , despite the many positive contributions immigrants are making to @entity11 society			0
it is long past time for the president to take unambiguous action to prevent further harm to immigrants and their families -- harm that can be easily avoided by providing them with legal status			0
what does this mean in practical terms ? for a start , the president should implement broad and inclusive administrative relief from deportation to parents of @entity72 recipients and other hardworking immigrants who are contributing to our economy and communities			0
this is the only way to ensure that families like @entity96 's do not continue paying the price for the failure of @entity161 to pass meaningful immigration reform when they had the opportunity			1
providing legal status to hardworking immigrants could have allowed @entity96 's father to attain a job with health benefits that could have saved @entity96 's mother 's life			2
and while the president can not bring @entity96 's mother back , it is not too late to help millions of other immigrants and @entity11 citizens who are fighting every day to keep their families together and their communities safe			2
@entity11 needs broad - based action on immigration reform			1
it is not just the right thing to do economically -- it will also save lives .			1

11 million waiting on immigration reform , say @entity186 , @entity187
*midterm* results show folly of @entity12 administration 's approach , they say
immigration reform will help save lives , *authors* argue
