-- @entity1 did n't think anyone would notice her blog outside of a small circle of friends			1
but she was wrong , way wrong			0
millions of people were keenly interested in the @entity9 mother 's struggles with the 13 - year - old son she loves and fears			1
a 40 - year - old mother of four , @entity1 teaches @entity13 at a small college in @entity15			1
on friday she posted a brutally honest essay on her blog , @entity18			1
it struck a nerve in the wake of the mass shooting in which 20 children died at @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26			0
over the weekend , it seemed , everybody was sharing the post and talking about @entity18			1
then came the backlash , as others criticized her for committing her son and writing about it publicly			1
read more : the backlash against ' i am @entity37 's mother ' for @entity1 , the blog post was " a cry for help , a real gut - check article , " she said , a way to articulate for friends the cold , gripping fear she has been living with for so long			1
she finally came to terms with an issue she 'd been avoiding : something serious is up with this boy			0
he goes into blind rages , he threatens violence and he is getting harder to control			0
she does n't yet have a specific diagnosis , and she does n't know what to do			0
" he 's in a good mood most of the time , " she wrote			1
" but when he 's not , watch out			1
and it 's impossible to predict what will set him off			1
" read the complete blog post on wednesday , @entity1 followed a social worker 's advice and committed her son to an acute care psychiatric facility			1
during an argument over whether he could wear blue pants to school , he had threatened to kill himself by jumping out of the car			0
it was a line she 'd warned him not to cross			0
a few weeks earlier , she called police when he pulled a knife , threatening to kill her and himself when he was asked to return overdue library books			0
he was strapped to a gurney and taken to a hospital emergency room , where he eventually calmed down			0
during the argument over the pants , he threw yet another " full - blown fit , " complete with screaming and hitting			0
" i hugged him close , so he could n't escape from the car , " she wrote			0
" he bit me several times and repeatedly jabbed his elbows into my rib cage			0
i 'm still stronger than he is , but i wo n't be for much longer			0
" a psychiatric commitment is @entity9 's temporary solution , lasting 10 to 14 days			1
after that , she says , her only other option is jail or juvenile detention			0
a leap of faith is required when listening to @entity1 's heart - wrenching story because confidentiality laws surrounding mental health issues make it difficult if not impossible to verify			1
but @entity1 provided details , including the names of the hospital and her son 's school program , and offered to make copies of ambulance and hospital bills available			1
shooter 's mother struggled to raise son , relative says " no one wants to send a 13 - year - old genius who loves @entity121 and his snuggle animal collection to jail , " she wrote in her blog			1
" but our society , with its stigma on mental illness and its broken health care system , does not provide us with other options			1
then another tortured soul shoots up a fast food restaurant			0
and we wring our hands and say , ' something must be done			0
' " @entity1 says she has been told that her best option is to file criminal charges and build a paper trail			1
" it 's just total , total frustration , " she said over the phone			1
" why are we doing this to the mentally ill ? he 's not a bad kid			1
he 's a troubled kid			1
i just want to get help for my son			1
" " @entity150 , " as she calls him on the blog , is exceptionally bright , with an " off - the - charts @entity149			1
" but his temper had always gone far beyond the usual childhood tantrums			0
and his behavior grew stranger as he entered middle school			0
" if i could , i would wish my son into normalcy by sheer force of will , " @entity1 said			1
" i realized i was doing my family a disservice by thinking we were managing it			0
it 's been so hard on them			2
these kids are just so hurt			0
it 's really hurting our whole family			2
frankly , i think my son is scared of himself			2
" since committing him , she has visited her son daily			2
after the first day , @entity150 was angry and vengeful			1
after the second day , he started to calm down			0
by the third day " he totally owned all the behavior , " tearfully telling her , " @entity176 , i 'm scared , too			1
" in school shootings , patterns and warning signs " he does tend to forget about when he 's violent , " she explained			1
" he sees red and then he 's gone			2
" she added that she has told him about her viral blog post , which she titled " thinking the @entity181			1
" others who picked it up , including the @entity184 and @entity185 , changed the headline to " i am @entity37 's mother			2
" @entity1 wrote that she thinks about her son every time there is a mass shooting			1
she fears that he might someday be capable of such explosive violence			0
" i love my son			2
but he terrifies me , " @entity1 wrote			1
" i am sharing this story because i am @entity37 's mother			2
i am @entity194 's mother and @entity194 ' mother			2
i am @entity197 ' mother			0
i am @entity199 's mother			2
i am @entity205 's mother , " she wrote , rattling off the names behind some of the nation 's most notorious mass shootings : @entity24 ; @entity206 ; a crowded movie theater in @entity208 , @entity209 ; a shopping center near @entity211 , @entity212 ; @entity213 " and these boys -- and their mothers -- need help , " she added			2
" in the wake of another horrific national tragedy , it 's easy to talk about guns			2
but it 's time to talk about mental illness			2
" @entity1 says @entity150 is a sweet boy most of the time			1
when he throws fits , he is so scary that she gathers up the knives , scissors and other sharp implements and keeps them with her in a plastic container			2
she says her other kids -- ages 15 , 9 and 7 -- know the " safety drill " by heart : when @entity150 starts to go off , they run into the car and lock the doors			1
thousands of people have posted comments on her blog -- nearly 3,000 by monday night			2
many of them thanked her , and said they were in similar situations			0
" i am moved to tears because this is my story , too , " one woman posted under the name " @entity244 " " i ca n't believe it			0
you just described my brother ! " wrote " @entity250			0
" " i raised a boy like your ' @entity150			1
i so get it , " wrote " @entity254			0
" but there were critics as well , including an equally passionate , equally viral blog by writer @entity258 , who accused @entity1 of invading " @entity261 " privacy with " vindictive and cruel posts about her children in which she fantasizes about beating them , locking them up and giving them away			1
" in many of the posts , @entity258 notes , @entity1 's " allegedly insane and violent son is portrayed as a normal boy who incites her wrath by being messy , buying too many @entity273 products and supporting @entity274			1
" @entity258 did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment , and by midafternoon it appeared the two bloggers had reached a truce			0
they posted a joint statement on both of their blogs : " whatever disagreements we have had , we both believe that the stigma attached to mental illness needs to end			0
we need to provide affordable , quality mental health care for families			2
we need to provide support for families who have a relative who is struggling			0
" both agreed that privacy is paramount for family members , especially children			0
" neither of us anticipated the viral response to our posts , " the statement continued			2
" we are not interested in being part of a ' mommy war			0
' we are interested in opening a serious conversation on what can be done for families in need			0
" @entity1 , who says she 's " kind of an introvert , " has n't owned a television set since the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
she did n't go looking for fame , but one viral blog post later , fame found her			1
she began making the rounds at the television networks before dawn on monday , appearing on @entity314 's " today " show , then chatting with @entity315 over at @entity316 and again with @entity0 's @entity317			2
and then she put it all behind her , pleased that she was able to get the conversation started			0
strangers inspired to honor @entity25 victims @entity0 's @entity323 contributed to this story			0
