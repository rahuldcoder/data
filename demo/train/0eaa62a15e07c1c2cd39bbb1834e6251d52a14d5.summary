@entity1 gov. @entity0 vetoed a bill friday that would have banned crates that severely limit the mobility of pregnant pigs , a move that will win favor with @entity9 farmers and spark more speculation about @entity0 's presidential aspirations but cause outrage among animal rights activists who pushed for the ban			1
critics consider the small metal crates a form of animal cruelty -- the pigs are n't able to turn around in the limited space -- but advocates say they prevent sows from accidentally lying down or stepping on piglets			1
despite its strong bipartisan support in the state legislature , the @entity26 governor vetoed a version of the bill in 2013			2
when a nearly identical version passed again in the @entity34 - led legislature , @entity0 faced mounting pressure this fall from activists and celebrities , including @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
@entity42 gave the issue wider attention when he featured it in a segment on @entity47 's " @entity46 " this month			0
and @entity48 , a former speechwriter and adviser to president @entity50 , wrote a lengthy essay for @entity52 , spelling out a case for banning the crates			0
in a statement , @entity0 said the bill is a " solution in search of a problem " and a " political movement masquerading as substantive policy			0
" arguing that it 's not a practice in @entity1 , @entity0 said it should be left to the state 's @entity65 , which currently does n't outlaw the crates			1
read the full veto statement ( @entity69 ) the move , announced by his office the day after @entity73 , places 2016 squarely in the spotlight			0
with more than 20 million pigs , @entity9 is the nation 's largest pork producer , and the state 's governor , @entity77 , told @entity79 that he urged @entity0 to veto the bill when a similar version came to the @entity1 governor 's desk last year			1
@entity77 also said he and @entity0 talked about the latest measure during an @entity9 event last month			1
with @entity9 holding the nation 's first presidential nomination caucuses , @entity0 's veto will almost surely spark further speculation that he is intent on moving forward with a presidential campaign			2
according to the @entity92 , nine other states are moving away from the practice , while companies like @entity95 's , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 are discontinuing the crates from their supply chains			0
" this veto shows cynical political calculation from the governor and an obvious capitulation to special interests , rather than leadership or humanity , " said @entity101 , president of the @entity102			0
@entity1 state sen. @entity110 , who authored the legislation , said @entity0 is " putting his personal political ambitions ahead of the humane treatment of animals			0
" " it has the support of the people of @entity1 as well as @entity26 and @entity34 lawmakers in the @entity120 , but the governor chose to follow the dictates of special interests in @entity9 , " he said in a statement .			2
