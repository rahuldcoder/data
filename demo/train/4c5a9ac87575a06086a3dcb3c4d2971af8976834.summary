-- more timely now than when it premiered at the @entity2 in january 2008 , " @entity3 , " an agreeable , midrange independent film , makes light work of heavy burdens			1
@entity7 gets to work cleaning up as @entity8 in the indie comedy " @entity3			1
" sisters @entity8 ( @entity7 ) and @entity12 ( @entity10 ) struggle with menial jobs and periods of unemployment			1
together , they 're also coping with the nasty emotional residue of their mom 's long - ago suicide -- a trauma that is likely responsible for their current troubles			1
self - esteem is n't a strong suit for either of them			1
as " @entity3 " dawns , they 're both scraping by			1
if @entity12 is out of work before we 've settled into our popcorn , she 's not overly concerned by her situation			2
@entity8 , on the other hand , is desperate to graduate from cleaning other people 's middle - class homes			1
it 's not just that the humiliation of laundering for her old cheerleader team is getting her down ; she needs the money to put her " difficult " kid ( @entity43 ) into the kind of school that will give him a chance			2
it 's @entity8 's married boyfriend -- and old high school sweetheart -- @entity51 ( @entity50 ) who spies a new niche for the sisters			1
a homicide detective , he 's watching the cleaning crew bag the blown brains of a shotgun enthusiast when he overhears the proprietor of the building grousing about the " three grand " it 's costing him			1
granted , blood and intestinal juices are n't everybody 's cup of tea , but that kind of return sure beats washing mrs. @entity70 's drapes for $ 30 an hour			2
" csm : @entity77 " is n't a job you 're likely to find down at the employment office , but somebody must be doing the dirty work			0
@entity8 and @entity12 -- incorporated -- find that the stench takes some getting used to , and there 's a whole new arsenal of cleaning fluids to master , but they get to work with a positive attitude and like to think they 're doing their bit to put the world right			0
from this unusual setup , the movie might have skewed in any number of ways			2
the sisters might have uncovered evidence of corruption and murder , for instance , perhaps implicating @entity51 ? " @entity3 " is nowhere near so abrasive or generic as such a scenario			1
written by @entity99 and directed by @entity100 ( " @entity101 " ) , it instead puts a sympathetic , gentle comic gloss on the characters ' fundamentally forgivable foibles and imperfections			0
@entity12 tracks down the daughter of one suicide ( @entity108 ) to present her with mementos that should have been destined for the junkyard			0
@entity10 's edgy performance keeps us guessing			0
@entity12 's a bit of a flake , but she 's animated by her anger and her rebellious streak			0
if she 's hard to read , it 's because she 's still young and does n't know herself yet			0
@entity8 is easier to understand			0
she 's determined to seize this chance to dig herself out of the hole and recapture the promise she used to see in herself			0
@entity121 has a knack for putting a brave face on things -- something about the way she tilts her chin up while her mouth goes in three directions at once			0
she keeps our rooting interest in @entity8 alive even when her choices seem misguided or naive			0
a subplot concerning @entity8 's son bonding with @entity136 ( @entity137 ) , the sisters ' lovable but infuriating father ( you know the kind : he buys bulk orders of shrimp off the back of a truck ) tips us too far into the realm of indie quirk			2
the character is a useful sounding board , and an amusing grouch , but it 's just about impossible to imagine this man bringing up these girls			0
ironically , for a movie that 's marketed with the one - liner " life 's a messy business , " @entity99 's script has been polished to within an inch of its life			1
emotions are experienced most vividly when they 're raw , but in " @entity3 , " feelings come filtered through neat - and - tidy grace notes			1
the film flirts with dangerous material , but it 's too intent on putting the sunny side up to get its hands dirty			0
the way director @entity100 tells it , not only is suicide painless it can be positively feel - good			2
that 's not to say there is n't a lot to enjoy in this well - acted and humanistic comedy			2
buoyed by its up - and - coming stars and its optimistic message , it should do very nicely with discriminating audiences			1
... it might even clean up .			0

@entity183 : up - and - coming stars , optimistic message buoy " @entity3 "
