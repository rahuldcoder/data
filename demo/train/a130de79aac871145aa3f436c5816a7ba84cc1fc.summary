-- at last it appears the pieces in soccer 's latest transfer window jigsaw are slowly falling into place			0
a pair of big - money moves involving @entity9 clubs on wednesday could spark a frenzy of activity as @entity13 's leading clubs aim to finish their business before tuesday 's deadline			2
@entity17 - based club @entity16 are at the coalface as things stand , securing a $ 40 million deal shortly after missing out on another to rivals @entity21			1
all this with the potential world record transfer of their star player @entity23 to @entity26 giants @entity25 simmering in the background -- a move that manager @entity29 admits is close			1
but while the two @entity33 clubs are splashing out lavish sums on new players , the teams they are buying from are resigned to having to offload their big names in a bid to balance the books			0
@entity40 club @entity39 announced their intention to sell a swathe of their stars earlier this month , alerting both @entity21 and @entity16 to the availability of @entity46 midfielder @entity45			1
the 25 - year - old appeared to be set for a move to @entity16 , but @entity21 swooped in to hijack the deal and on wednesday announced it had been completed , for a fee reported to be $ 46.5 million			1
it means manager @entity51 has ten midfielders at his disposal and raises the prospect that @entity26 playmaker @entity55 , who has n't featured in @entity21 's first two games of the season , might be sold			2
@entity45 told @entity21 's official website : " @entity21 are one of the best clubs in the world , and now i 'm going to play for one of the best managers in the world			1
" it 's been my dream to come to play here			0
@entity21 was always my first choice			2
" finally it 's become a reality , and when the offer came i never gave a thought to anybody else , i said to myself that i would run here , and i 'm happy to be here now			0
" @entity21 are still in the market for @entity73 and @entity75 striker @entity74 , who played for the @entity33 champions against @entity21 in their goalless draw on monday night			0
the striker was afforded a fine reception by the home supporters , and took to his @entity81 page on wednesday to thank them for their support , the biggest hint yet that he might opt to stay at @entity84			0
@entity16 's frustration at missing out on @entity45 might have been eased by a new signing of their own , as @entity89 club @entity88 announced midfielder @entity90 was set to join them for a fee of $ 39.9 million			1
at the same time the club confirmed the signing of @entity94 from fellow @entity96 side @entity97 for $ 14.5 million , who is expected to fill the gap left by @entity90 , from @entity100			2
@entity90 's acquisition means @entity16 have broken their transfer record three times in the close season , after the arrivals of @entity107 from @entity108 and @entity109 from @entity110			1
they have also signed @entity113 midfielder @entity112 and @entity115 winger @entity114 as @entity29 overhauls his squad in the face of @entity23 's departure			1
the @entity120 's move to @entity25 appears to be moving closer given @entity16 's transfer outlay , @entity29 telling a news conference on wednesday it could happen " very soon			1
" but the @entity123 also registered his disappointment that @entity23 has missed several training sessions as the saga unfolded			0
" he is involved in a big transfer move to @entity25 and in the end if it happens , we wish him all the best , but the fact that he has n't turned up is not the correct behavior , " @entity29 told reporters			2
" that is the position they chose to take and it 's up to the club to decide if it 's a fineable offense			0
" as for how quickly @entity23 's switch to @entity140 could be concluded @entity29 added : " it could happen very , very soon			1
" will he be in tomorrow ? i do n't know			0
i 'm not really in control of the situation i 've left it up to the club to decide what they want to do			0
" it 's up to @entity23 ( whether he wants to come back again )			2
he has a good relationship with everybody and he has saluted the players the other day , myself included			0
