since 2008 , @entity1 's annual jamboree honoring the world 's best player has been dominated by just two names			1
@entity6 , @entity7 , @entity7 , @entity7 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity8			1
monday saw @entity9 and @entity10 superstar @entity8 crowned as winner of the @entity12 for a second year in a row			1
it came as scant surprise , given his club 's phenomenal form in 2014 that saw the return of @entity20 trophy -- and with it the coveted " decima , " or tenth @entity24 triumph -- to the @entity25			2
" it has been an incredible year , " he said at the awards ceremony			0
" i would like to continue the work that i have done so far			0
i want to try to improve , to become better as each day goes by			0
" i never thought that i would bring this trophy back home on three occasions			0
i want to become one of the greatest players of all time			0
" top of their game this seven - year duopoly reflects the importance of these two supreme athletes on the game , and allows us to see how lucky we are to be able to witness the long summers of two of the finest players to ever grace the sport			0
and part of the fascination lies in how different the two men are			0
debating the relative merits of @entity8 and his great rival @entity7 , talismans of @entity10 and @entity51 , respectively , has been something of a parlor game in recent years			1
it 's easy to compare and contrast , at least superficially			2
on the one hand , the improbable , mercurial talent of the shaggy haired , oddly stooped figure of @entity7 , confusing defenders as much as inspiring his teammates to a higher level			1
on the other : @entity8			1
a glistening , taut mass of muscle , neck like a tree trunk , powering forward relentlessly			0
he looks like he was created in a lab or a high tech factory ; a @entity70 , the ultimate footballer			0
media matters the two could n't be much more different , in style and , if you are to believe the majority of the media , likability			0
@entity8 has suffered the slings and arrows of a largely hostile press for much of his career , starting as a foal - limbed teen in @entity84 , where he was often derided as a " show pony , " for elaborate and unnecessary tricks , and -- a sin in the @entity89 game -- diving to win free kicks and penalties			1
the negativity followed him to @entity10 and a then - record transfer fee			2
it is largely @entity10 's cheerleading press , @entity97 and @entity98 , that give him a free pass ; the rest of the global sporting media grudgingly accept his gifts , but are quick to level criticism when they feel it due			1
he 's often seen as a ball - hog , a selfish player who would rather shoot than pass to a teammate			2
that he has taken at least 10 shots at goal in nine matches does n't exactly banish the perception			0
that his fellow " galactico " @entity112 would have the temerity to take a shot ( and miss ) in a recent liga game rather than pass to @entity6 , as the virtuoso has styled himself , earned him a withering look from the @entity9 master , and the opprobrium of fans			1
off the field , his reticence to engage the media -- a symptom , it is said , of his shyness -- has been interpreted as haughty and arrogant			0
@entity7 , on the other hand , who also eschews media coverage has typically been viewed as humble and self - effacing -- although recent tax and locker room scandals threaten to change that			1
phenomenal 2014 but the stats do n't lie , and with the phenomenal return of 61 goals from 60 appearances ( 42 in 30 @entity141 games alone ) during 2014 , it 's hard not to give credit to this year 's winner			2
he reached the 400 - goal milestone for club and country ( in 653 appearances ) in january , he is a footballing genius , and had he stood alone -- his yin unopposed by @entity7 's yang -- he would no doubt be already talked of as one of the all - time greats			1
as it stands , he 's talking about that honor in aspirational terms , as a goal ; he 's spent most of his career battling comparisons			1
he 's also developed in leaps and bounds since his 2008 @entity12 trophy , refined his unquestionable talent since he first grinned on that @entity1 stage			1
he 's far more mature ; gone are the unnecessary stepovers and ( almost ) the petulance			2
to complement this , he long ago inherited an undimmable desire to win from his old mentor , @entity169 , and he burns with passion and a need to score			0
that 's only become more evident as he grows into the complete player he has developed into over the past couple of years			1
and along with his natural ability , he 's long been an indefatigable , consummate professional who gives everything he has until the final whistle , and that 's what has fueled his work - and goal - rate in 2014			2
he still takes a lot of shots , sure , but when " @entity8 does n't score , " on the rare occasions that he walks away from a match without netting a goal is the headline , maybe he 's right to do so			1
certainly his @entity10 coach , @entity188 , does n't begrudge him the efforts			2
@entity190 woes ? @entity192 's irrepressible keeper @entity191 -- who was a distant outlier for the @entity12 this year -- may feel aggrieved that his superlative @entity190 went unnoticed in voting			1
indeed , @entity195 won the award 's predecessor , the @entity198 in 2006 , off the back of his considerable influence captaining @entity201 to 2006 @entity190 glory			0
but while he had a largely anonymous @entity190 , it would be difficult to deny that , year round , it has been @entity6 's year			0
and , like the man or not , no one should begrudge him his time at the pinnacle .			0

@entity10 superstar @entity8 picks up his second *consecutive* @entity12
comparisons with fellow great @entity7 have dogged @entity8 's career
