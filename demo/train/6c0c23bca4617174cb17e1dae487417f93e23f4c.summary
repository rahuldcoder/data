@entity8 's decision launched a number of congressional inquiries , and @entity45 told the @entity23 he ca n't explain it			1
" it is so easy not to have done it , " he said			0
" this is not like it 's a close question			0

according to @entity61 , @entity8 was not totally " politically astute " at the time and " learned " to play politics over time			1
" i think she 's much more politically astute now than she was in early 1993 , " @entity61 said while @entity8 served as the junior senator from @entity70			1
" i think she learned			0
she learns , and she knows she made mistakes			0
she 's said it herself			0
i know she was not as politically astute then as she is now			1
" @entity8 is now considering a run at the @entity76 in 2016			1

" -- @entity12 , former chief of staff to the president when @entity12 was pressed about @entity99 -- the @entity76 intern whose affair with the president spiraled into a national saga -- he said he knew the president had " eyed " her but chalked it up as " no different than anything else			1

' " @entity112 asked , " why not ? " @entity108 replied , " he 's got a woman problem			1
) the @entity99 affair " probably kept some people away from the polls that might have voted for @entity126 " -- @entity128 , top aide to vice president @entity126 @entity128 told the @entity129 that @entity8 's affair with @entity99 probably cost @entity126 votes in the incredibly close 2000 election			1
" i 'm absolutely convinced ... that the @entity99 affair really energized social conservatives and so angered a lot of people , and they had nowhere to vent that anger , " he said			1
" they could n't vote against @entity8			2
... if they had gone to the polls they would have voted for @entity126 , but they were just disgusted			0

" she wears her heart on her sleeve much more than he does			0
less and less now that she 's her own public figure , but that 's her nature			0

" -- @entity13 , a @entity8 domestic policy adviser during the 1992 @entity171 primary , then ( and now ) @entity169 gov. @entity165 attacked @entity8 over @entity31 's law firm and @entity168 ties			1
" in the primaries , he had lost his temper a few times , " said @entity13			0
" he came close to punching @entity165 in the @entity70 debate when @entity165 attacked @entity31 for being on the @entity168 board , something like that			0
" @entity8 would go on to win the nomination and now @entity165 is supporting @entity31 's prospective run at the presidency .			1
