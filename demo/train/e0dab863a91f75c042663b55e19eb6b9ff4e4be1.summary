@entity3 's justice minister held a " cordial " meeting with @entity6 ambassador @entity5 on the capture of alleged @entity9 operative @entity8 by @entity6 forces over the weekend in @entity11 , two senior @entity1 officials said tuesday			1
the session was " all very cordial albeit with concerns , " one of the officials said			2
the meeting had previously been described as a " summoning , " a more formal diplomatic term frequently used when one country wants to express displeasure with another			0
@entity3 's @entity21 on tuesday demanded that @entity6 officials hand over @entity8 , spokesman @entity20 said			1
he also demanded that @entity3 authorities and @entity8 's family have access to him in the meantime			1
the developments come as 200 heavily armed @entity6 @entity28 headed to an @entity30 naval base , poised to fly at a moment 's notice to @entity3 should the @entity6 embassy come under assault from angry crowds in the wake of @entity8 's capture			1
@entity6 army @entity39 soldiers captured @entity8 this weekend in @entity11			1
he is accused of playing a role in the 1998 @entity6 embassy bombings in @entity42 and @entity43			2
the deployment , which began monday , was made in coordination with the @entity1 , a military official told @entity47			2
the official called the move a " prudent measure " after the @entity6 military raid to capture @entity8			1
the @entity28 are part of a 500 - member unit formed after the 2012 attack on the @entity6 diplomatic compound in @entity57 that left ambassador @entity58 and two other @entity6 citizens dead			1
military forces were not close enough to respond to that attack			0
the official said they were being moved along with three @entity65 aircraft capable of delivering them and their supplies to @entity3 , which lies about 328 miles ( 528 kilometers ) across the @entity68			2
what the terror raids say about an ' @entity71 ' @entity72 on monday , @entity8 was on a @entity75 warship , where he was being questioned by a high - value detainee interrogation group -- an @entity78 - led team with intelligence experts from the @entity80 and other agencies -- which is determining whether he has information about @entity9 operations , future attacks or the whereabouts of known associates , @entity6 officials have said			1
a @entity89 statement says he is being held " lawfully under the law of war in a secure location outside of @entity3			0
" it is unclear how long he will be interrogated , but @entity6 officials have said he will be transferred to @entity94 for trial			1
the 49 - year - old alleged @entity9 operative is accused of playing a role in the 1998 @entity6 embassy bombings in @entity42 and @entity43 that killed 224 people and wounded about 4,000 more			0
he was indicted in the @entity100 in the embassy bombings and in connection with his alleged roles in @entity9 conspiracies to attack @entity6 forces in @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			1
wife : @entity8 no longer with @entity9 civilian trial president @entity111 and attorney general @entity112 have previously said they prefer to try individuals such as @entity8 in @entity6 courts			1
@entity117 is n't on alleged 9/11 mastermind @entity119 's level , so do n't expect the same hullabaloo over @entity6 plans to try the @entity3 terror suspect on @entity6 soil , legal experts said monday			1
" he will be brought back to the @entity6 and tried in a federal criminal courtroom , " @entity47 senior analyst @entity123 said			0
" @entity111 's trying to close @entity125 , not add prisoners			0
" and unlike previous cases , such as @entity119 's , " i really do n't think there 's going to be too much protest or concern or worry if they proceed that way , " said @entity127 , a professor and the director of security studies at the @entity130			0
" i honestly do n't think he has the name - brand recognition , shall we say , of a @entity119 , " @entity127 said			0
in the past , terrorism suspects captured on @entity6 soil generally have been tried in federal courts -- such as @entity143 , the would - be " undiebomber " who tried unsuccessfully to set off a bomb on a @entity6 - bound jetliner in 2009 ; attempted @entity149 bomber @entity148 ; or 9/11 co-conspirator @entity150			2
it 's " murky territory " when a fugitive is nabbed overseas by @entity6 forces , said @entity154 , a former director of terrorism studies at @entity157			1
but " my hunch is they 'll probably go the criminal route			0
" when the @entity162 in 2009 proposed trying @entity119 and four other 9/11 suspects in @entity164 , the plan was met with staunch criticism from @entity167 leaders who said such a trial would be costly and asserted that the five terror suspects -- none of whom was an @entity6 citizen -- did n't deserve the rights and protections civilian courts afford defendants			0
in 2011 , @entity112 begrudgingly announced that the five suspected conspirators ' fates would be decided via military tribunals at @entity180 , @entity181 , prompting backlash from @entity183 and human rights groups who painted the tribunals as untested , flawed and the likely subject of numerous legal challenges			0
" had this case proceeded in @entity164 or in an alternative venue in the @entity6 , as i seriously explored in the past year , i am confident that our justice system would have performed with the same distinction that has been its hallmark for over 200 years , " @entity112 said at the time			2
@entity117 's case should not raise the same issues , @entity123 said , because , as the suspected 9/11 mastermind , @entity119 was " in a separate category from everyone else in the world			0
" while the @entity6 considers @entity8 a dangerous terrorist , neither he nor his crimes are as well - known as @entity119 's , @entity123 said			1
as for @entity8 's interrogation , @entity123 noted that there is no indication he is being tortured and that if @entity8 were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques , the @entity6 government has been clear that " they will not use the results of torture like waterboarding in any criminal case			1
" " the government obviously believes he 's a very dangerous person , captured in a dangerous part of the world , and he needs to be isolated and brought back to the @entity6 , " @entity123 said			2
but @entity154 questioned how much valuable intelligence @entity8 would be able to provide his captors			0
a former jihadist associate told @entity47 it was unlikely that he was still playing an active role with the terrorist network , and his wife said he had been living a normal life and was seeking a job with the @entity3 oil ministry			0
" who knows if he 's really up to speed on anything useful these days ? " @entity154 asked			0
opinion : good thing @entity6 terrorist hunters were n't furloughed			0

@entity3 's @entity21 demands return of @entity8 , spokesman says
meeting between @entity3 , @entity6 officials " cordial , " @entity1 officials say
200 @entity6 @entity28 go to an @entity30 naval base , poised to fly to @entity3 , if needed
@entity6 forces captured @entity8 over weekend in @entity11 , transferred him out of @entity3
