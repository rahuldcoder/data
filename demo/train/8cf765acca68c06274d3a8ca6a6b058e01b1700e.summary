-- @entity1 might cut most of the federal funding for your local poison control center , which could mean a longer wait during your next poison - related emergency			1
@entity8 1 would cut $ 27.3 million , or about 93 % , of federal funding for poison control centers across the @entity11			1
the bill was passed by the @entity13 , but rejected by the @entity14 on march 9			1
congressional leaders now need to negotiate a final spending measure , and that bill might include cuts to the poison control centers			1
" my feeling is that just based on my experience , it would end up costing lives somewhere along the way , " says @entity19 , a nurse with 30 years experience who recently called a poison center when her husband , @entity22 , accidentally inhaled pesticide fumes while cleaning out the garage			2
" i 've dealt with some emergencies in this field over my career , but i was completely at a loss as to what to do			0
when it came to this , i felt completely helpless			0
" @entity36 dialed the national poison center hot line 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 and was told to take her husband to the hospital if he had specific symptoms , including vomiting			1
he 'd already thrown up , so they headed to the emergency department , where he was treated and released			0
it 's not just the patients hospitals rely on poison control centers , too			1
poison centers answered 4.2 million calls in 2009 , and about 16 % of those calls came from hospitals seeking their expertise			1
" after the hospital did their initial treatment , " says @entity36 , " they also called the poison control center to verify that they had administered the correct treatment			1
" what about when you dial 911 ? they call your poison center , too			2
when the 911 operators figure out your emergency is poisoning related , they conference in the poison center for a three - way conversation			2
that 's because the poison center staff answering phone calls include nurses , physicians and pharmacists with specialized poison center training , and there is always a toxicologist on call			1
" if we 're not around , you better tell your 911 operator to strap their belts on to answer a whole lot of calls that they do n't know a damn thing about and ca n't safely manage that patient at home , " says @entity81 , director of the @entity82			2
spending here , saving there poison control center operators say their services save health care dollars , primarily because most callers are told they do n't need a hospital			1
eliminating call centers could increase unnecessary trips to the hospital , further burdening the health care system , they say			2
" poison centers treat nearly 75 % of all exposure cases at home , without the patient having to go to a health care facility , " said @entity103 , executive director of the @entity104 , in a written statement			1
" the costs of this cut would ultimately far exceed the $ 27 million saved			1
" according to a study cited by the @entity114 , for every dollar spent on poison control centers , $ 7 in health care spending is saved			1
other studies find the per dollar value of poison control centers to be far greater			1
@entity121 has already been down this road			0
because of state budget cuts , the @entity82 closed on october 31 , 1988			2
the percentage of patients treated at home dropped to 28.6 % , from 74.1 % before the center closed , according to a 1991 study published in the @entity129			2
the @entity82 reopened in 1992 , because the additional health care costs outweighed the savings , and because of stories like @entity133 's			2
@entity133 's 2 - year - old daughter swallowed an antibiotic cream one day in 1990			2
with the @entity82 closed , she called another state 's poison center for help , but the staff was instructed not to help her , because the state where she lived , @entity121 , was not paying for their poison center services			1
" it was the most horrible feeling in the world , " says @entity133			0
" what if my daughter died because they would n't help me ? " she then called a @entity148 poison center , where she got help			2
creating one national call center the cuts in federal funding would eliminate all but one of the nation 's 57 poison control centers , which rely heavily on federal funding			1
click here to see how many federal dollars your local poison control center receives			1
" there 's just no reason to maintain 57 separate call centers around the country when technology would enable us to get the job done with one , " said a statement from rep. @entity163 , @entity164 , chairman of the @entity165			1
" we can save millions simply by cutting out 56 duplicative locations and with record debt and deficits putting our future in jeopardy , it 's worth looking under every rock for savings			0
" poison control center operators strongly disagree			1
" local relationships are invaluable " says @entity182			0
" there 's no way a single center could get in there and provide for the wants and needs of every state			0
" he also warns of putting all resources in a single entity			0
" what happens if the hypothetical ' single ' center gets wiped out by a tornado and the infrastructure is destroyed ? where are those 12,000 + calls each day going to go ? " many health care students -- doctors , nurses , pharmacists , @entity205 -- receive formal toxicology training from their local center			0
" who else knows what we know ? " says @entity81			0
it is unclear how one enormous center would be funded , or in which state it would be			0
" if you want the same number of people to be answered , " says @entity215 , director of the @entity216 , " suddenly you need to have probably six - or seven - hundred people working in a single poison control center			1
" proponents of the one - center plan cite innovation in private business and say government could follow the example to be more efficient			0
" if you look at things like bookstores or movie rental stores , with internet technology , where long distances really are n't an issue anymore , what they do is they save a ton of money by putting everything in a single warehouse , " said one congressional staffer speaking anonymously			0
could it work ? many call centers already serve areas far beyond their locale			0
a call center in @entity248 also handles emergencies in @entity250 and @entity251			0
a @entity255 , @entity256 , call center serves the @entity257			0
and @entity258 -- @entity163 's state -- is served by the @entity260 , which also handles @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264 , negotiating rates with each state			0
cell phones also make out - of - state poison emergencies a common thing			0
timing the announcement with @entity271 , which began sunday , the @entity104 will release an @entity273 app to help users dial the poison control hot line			1
those calls , like all cell phone calls , may ring at the nearest poison control center , or not			1
" every single center gets calls from other states almost daily , " says @entity81			0
" two or three a day ; we see it more with certain carriers than others			0
" still , poison center operators insist that local matters			0
" i think it was just an ill - informed decision by somebody who , let 's just hope , was new on the scene , " says @entity215 about the proposed budget cuts , " and was n't that ill - informed after lots of experience			2

@entity8 1 could cut 93 % of federal funding for poison control centers
@entity13 passed @entity13 1 but @entity14 rejected it ; cut could still be in a final , negotiated bill
centers answered 4.2 million calls in 2009 ; about 16 % of those came from hospitals
the cuts are meant to eliminate all but one of the nation 's 57 poison control centers
