the nurse in @entity1 seemed to have taken all the precautions needed to protect herself from @entity5			1
she wore a mask , gown , shield and gloves			0
her patient , a man who contracted the virus in @entity12 , was in isolation at the @entity15 hospital where she worked			2
and yet the woman -- whose name has not been released -- still contracted @entity5 , marking the first known transmission ever in the @entity20			1
a nurse in @entity22 who also treated an @entity5 patient also caught the virus			1
she is in critical condition and being treated by 50 health care workers , @entity22 authorities said monday			0
the @entity28 said sunday there was a breach in protocol in @entity1 , but officials have n't elaborated on what that breach was			1
instead , they said the protocols laid out for @entity20 hospitals work			1
so what happened ? how could a nurse at an @entity20 hospital contract the virus ? is the situation a one - off , an instance of human error , something that probably would n't occur again ? or could there be more to it ? how it happened on monday morning , an official with direct knowledge of the @entity1 nurse 's case told @entity2 that @entity28 disease detectives have several times interviewed the @entity1 nurse and think there are " inconsistencies " in the type of personal protective gear that she wore and with the process used to put the gear on and remove it			1
the nurse who tested positive for the virus worked at @entity63 in @entity15			2
@entity28 director dr. @entity64 has said the agency is considering several possibilities as to how that breach may have happened , including whether the infection was spread when the protective equipment was removed or when the patient , @entity71 national @entity70 , received kidney dialysis or respiratory intubation			1
those measures were " a desperate measure to try to save his life , " @entity64 said			0
" both of those procedures may spread contaminated materials and are considered high - risk procedures			0
" " when you have potentially soiled or contaminated gloves or masks or other things , to remove those without any risk of any contaminated material ... touching you and being then on your clothes or face or skin ... is not easy to do right			0
" or the problem could have been something else entirely			0
@entity2 senior medical correspondent @entity93 said precautions among health care workers can actually go overboard sometimes			0
the workers are supposed to double their gloves in some situations , she said			0
@entity100 gloving is a violation of @entity28 protocol and could make things worse			0
" then you need to take off three pairs of gloves ... gloves with infectious stuff on them , " she said			0
how troubling it is the @entity28 concedes the transmission is worrisome			2
" it is possible in the coming days that we will see additional cases of @entity5 , " @entity64 said			1
that 's because others who provided care to @entity70 could have had the same kind of breach as the infected nurse			1
the official who has direct knowledge of the @entity1 case told @entity2 that health authorities will make daily visits to dozens of @entity15 health care workers who treated @entity70 between september 28 and october 8 at @entity63			1
the workers have been monitoring their own health , including taking their own temperature			0
they were previously not considered high risk because they were wearing protective gear , the official said			1
the @entity28 is still compiling a list of health care workers who came into contact with @entity70 , the official said			0
the public areas of the nurse 's apartment complex have been decontaminated and her neighbors have been notified			1
and the city of @entity15 made a reverse - 911 call to residents , notifying them of the city 's second @entity5 case			1
" i think it needs to be put into context that ... you ca n't make an extrapolation that this is now a danger more so to the @entity20 people , " said dr. @entity147 , director of the @entity148			1
but the fear is spreading			0
when a passenger on a flight from @entity158 to @entity159 fell ill sunday , the biggest concern was @entity5			1
the plane was taken to a remote gate at @entity162			0
after a few hours , officials determined the woman did not appear to have @entity5 , and other passengers were allowed to leave			2
and in @entity167 , attorney general @entity166 is seeking a temporary restraining order to block the disposal of incinerated waste from @entity70 's personal items at a @entity167 landfill			0
" there are too many unknowns at this point , and it is absurd to transport potentially hazardous @entity5 waste across state lines , " @entity166 said sunday			2
what is being done president @entity180 wants federal authorities to immediately take further measures to ensure health care workers are able to follow protocols for treating @entity5 patients			2
of the thousands of hospitals in the @entity20 , only four have been training for years to deal with highly infectious diseases like @entity5 : @entity188 in @entity189 , @entity190 , the @entity191 in @entity192 , and @entity193 in @entity194			1
" they have the management , the processes , the implementation in place that if an @entity5 patient comes in , just right away they know what to do , " said @entity200 , who teaches public health preparedness at @entity202			1
but if someone with symptoms of @entity5 shows up at any other hospital , as @entity70 did , the hospital might not be ready			2
" it may not be that every single hospital is in fact prepared for this , " said @entity210 , associate professor of biology at @entity212			0
" we may have to think about regional centers that are best prepared to deal with @entity5 patients			2
" another step in the battle : screening			0
on saturday , passengers arriving from the three countries hardest hit by @entity5 started getting special screening , including having their temperature taken , at @entity158 's @entity225			1
@entity228 's @entity227 , @entity229 , @entity231 's @entity230 and @entity189 international airports will begin screening thursday			0
' the time to act is long overdue ' the country 's largest nursing organization , @entity233 , surveyed 2,000 members			0
of them , 76 % said their hospital has n't communicated any policy about how to admit @entity5 - infected patients			2
and 85 % said their hospital has n't provided education on @entity5 where the nurses can interact and ask questions			1
nurses " are alarmed at the inadequate preparation they see at their hospitals , " said the group 's executive director , @entity245			2
" the time to act is long overdue , " she said .			0

official : " inconsistencies " seen in protective gear and the way it was put on and taken off
a @entity1 nurse contracts @entity5 from a patient
it 's the first known transmission of @entity5 ever in the @entity20
hundreds of nurses say they *'re* *unprepared* to handle @entity5
