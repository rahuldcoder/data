-- the @entity1 , commonly known as @entity1 , was passed into law more than three years ago , but it really does n't go into effect until next year			1
that 's when the major changes , including the health insurance exchanges ramp up and the @entity8 expansion occurs			1
because there has been such a long time between when things started and now , there are plenty of misconceptions about what 's happened , what 's going on , and what will occur			1
for instance , just a month ago , a poll found that 4 in 10 @entity19 were unsure about whether @entity1 still existed			1
about a quarter did n't know or did n't answer			0
an additional 7 % thought that the @entity20 had overturned it last year			1
another 12 % thought that it had been repealed by @entity23 and is no longer a law			1
those that still know @entity1 is around remain divided on how they feel about it			1
a more recent poll from @entity0 found that only 43 % of the public " supports the health care law			1
" this might lead you to think that most of the country wants it repealed			0
but , as with so many things related to health care reform , there 's more than meets the eye here			1
a full 16 % of @entity19 , about a third of those who " oppose the health care law , " do so because it 's not liberal enough			1
it 's important to remember that in many ways @entity1 was a " centrist " solution			1
many do n't like to hear that , believing that it 's socialism - writ - large , but a sizeable chunk of @entity19 supported something like @entity49 - for - all , a single - payer solution more like what @entity51 , or our elderly , enjoy			2
many of them still think that 's a better choice for health care reform			2
in other words , it might be fairer to say that 59 % of @entity19 support a system that is as liberal or more liberal than @entity1 , while 35 % do n't			1
that 's a much different interpretation than what many are repeating			2
regardless , it 's clear that many are still unclear about what 's going on with the law or how they feel about it			2
it 's not surprising , therefore , that the @entity71 administration is gearing up for another big push to sell its brand of reform to the @entity19 people			2
this is a critical time for the law			0
for better or worse , the @entity79 , for the most part , stands in total opposition to @entity1			1
many have called the law a " train wreck " waiting to happen , and they believe that letting the law fail , spectacularly , is the quickest way to get rid of that			2
because of this , few , if any , opponents of the law are willing to make any concessions or changes to it at all			0
this is a relatively new thing when it comes to major legislation			2
past laws on this scale , including the @entity98 , @entity49 , and @entity99 were amended and changed years and even months after being passed			0
that 's incredibly unlikely to happen with respect to @entity1			1
moreover , many are doing all they can actively to prevent the law from moving forward			0
about half of states have refused to partake in the @entity8 expansion , meaning that the majority of the poorest among us will not get @entity8 next year as the law originally planned			0
many states are also dragging their feet with respect to the insurance exchanges , hoping that if the federal government fails to get things going in time , @entity19 will see that the law is unsuccessful			2
widespread belief in this might help @entity79 increase their electoral power to the point that they can demand repeal			1
this strategy could backfire , though			0
@entity123 , one of the states most thoroughly embracing @entity1 , recently had its rates published for its insurance exchange			1
the cost of insurance premiums came in significantly below what had been projected			0
back in 2009 , projections for a " silver " plan for a 40 year old were $ 5,200 - 5,400 a year			0
last week , though , @entity123 announced that the most affordable " silver " plan would cost just over $ 3,300 a year			1
that is , of course , the cost without subsidies			0
for the many @entity19 who make less than 400 % of the poverty line , the cost to them will be even less			2
some will claim that this is still a rate increase for some			0
there is almost no policy that works out perfectly for everyone			0
it 's likely that some very young , healthy people will spend more on their insurance now for the chance to have it cheaper -- and guaranteed -- later			2
there are also some who will chafe at having to buy insurance at all			0
but the gambit of those opposing @entity1 seems to be a full throated and all - out - effort to show that @entity1 does n't work			1
the danger , though , is that it might			0
the jury is still out , of course			0
but it 's important to recognize that full - out opposition to reform like this is somewhat novel in @entity19 politics			0
no one knows what such a strategy will bring in the long run			0
many thought passing the @entity1 would be president @entity71 's " @entity174			1
in fact , some have argued that the flat out refusal to negotiate in the law 's passage cost opponents the chance to get a final product more to their liking			0
things are shaping up similarly now			0
if , a year from now , it appears that exchanges are working out in states that embraced them , and that the @entity8 expansion is succeeding in states that allowed it , then it may turn out that refusing to bend may have instead caused the opposition to break			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			1

@entity195 : @entity1 's major changes go into effect in 2014 ; misconceptions remain
he says polls show many opposed ; but 16 % of opposed say it 's not liberal enough
he says @entity79 want it to fail ; *unwilling* to even amend , change program
@entity195 : @entity123 exchanges proving less *expensive* than thought ; @entity79 should take note
