choosing healthier snacks may soon be easier			1
the @entity1 says that updating nutrition labels is a priority this year , although it 's unclear when the labels will change			1
the labels have remained pretty much the same for decades			1
it was n't until the late 1960s that most food labels listed any nutrition information at all			1
at the time , labels with calorie or sodium counts were mainly used on products the @entity1 considered to have " special dietary uses " -- for people with high blood pressure who were watching sodium , for instance			1
most people were making meals at home then , so there was n't a huge demand for this information			1
that changed as more people started eating processed foods			2
noticing the trend , the @entity28 pulled together a conference of nutritionists and food manufacturers in 1969			0
but it was n't until 1972 that the @entity1 proposed regulations about what those nutrition labels should show			1
nutrition labeling was voluntary at first			2
it was n't until 1990 that the @entity1 required nutrition labels for most prepared and packaged foods			1
labels for raw produce and fish remains voluntary			2
" it 's time to update ( labels ) to make ( them ) easier for consumers to use , " said @entity44 , director of nutrition policy for the @entity45			1
the nonprofit organization advocates for better safety and nutrition information in the food industry			2
" this is a chance to make ( the labels ) better and help make it easier for people to choose healthier options , " @entity44 said			1
there 's been a shift in shoppers ' priorities as nutrition is better understood , and people now have a better idea of what they should watch on a label , the @entity1 said			1
the focus has been on fat content ; now nutritionists say calorie counting may be more important and should be broken down better for consumers			2
the @entity45 gave the @entity1 its wish list for these labels			1
it wants a label that will emphasize calorie counts , perhaps in a bigger or bolder font size or in a number highlighted in some way			1
the organization would also like added sugar to get its own line on labels			1
studies show many @entity84 eat more sugar than they realize			1
our bodies do n't need sugar to function , according to the @entity90			2
right now , it 's hard to know what 's natural sugar and what 's added from reading a label			2
manufactures are allowed to combine the two			0
the heart association recommends you limit added sugar to no more than half of the daily discretionary calories you 're supposed to have			2
that means for @entity103 men , about 150 calories a day or nine teaspoons			0
for women it 's a smaller amount -- no more than 100 calories per day from added sugar , or about six teaspoons of sugar			0
the @entity45 would also like to limit the amount of math you now have to do when counting calories			0
if you have ever looked at a label and realize you 've eaten twice the serving size , you 'll appreciate that request			0
the organization also hopes to make the ingredient lists larger with better spacing			0
more @entity84 are interested in what 's on these food labels			0
the @entity84 @entity121 noticed a statistically significant jump in a study it released this month			0
the study showed 42 % of working - age adults between 29 and 68 looked at these labels most of the time when shopping , or even said they always did			0
some 57 % of @entity84 older than 68 did as well			0
in a 2007 @entity121 study , 34 % of working - age adults looked at the label , and 51 % of @entity84 older than 68 did			0
the increase is good news as the @entity84 struggles with an obesity epidemic			0
more than a third of all @entity84 are obese , according to the @entity137			0
some studies have shown that people who read labels eat healthier			1
one 2005 study of @entity103 shoppers in @entity143 found that to be true			0
a 2012 study of college students in @entity146 saw similar results .			0

the @entity1 is looking at how to update nutrition labels
*experts* want easier to read calorie counts and sugar amounts
studies show people who read nutrition labels eat healthier
