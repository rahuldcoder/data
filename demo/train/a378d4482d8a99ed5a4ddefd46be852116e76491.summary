-- in days of yore , comedian @entity1 said he used to try out jokes in clubs and adjust them based on an audience 's feedback			1
" today , the process is faster			1
it 's your brain , a button , then millions of reactions , " he said on his website			1
@entity1 was writing monday to explain himself after sending a tweet that , by his own admission , was " unfortunate			1
" " to those who were offended , again , i offer a deep , sincere , and humble apology without reservation , " he wrote			1
" but i feel i need to tell you the context and origin of the joke			1
" the storm started friday when he invited people to ask him grammar questions on @entity25			1
someone wrote , " is this how you spell lasonia ? " to which @entity1 replied : " it depends			2
are you in an @entity33 neighborhood or at an @entity35 restaurant			2
" " i knew of the name @entity37			2
i did not make it up , nor do i find it funny			2
so to me the answer was either @entity37 ( with a capital ) , or @entity42 , depending on what you meant			2
that they sounded alike in this rare and particular context struck me as funny			0
that was the joke , " he wrote on his website			0
" when the tweet went out , i saw some negative comments and immediately deleted the tweet and apologized			0
i gathered the perception was that i was making fun of @entity33 names			0
" the story did n't stop there			0
@entity1 said his tweet was picked up and quoted , inaccurately , by various outlets , including salon			0
are you in an @entity33 restaurant or at an @entity35 restaurant , " @entity59 said @entity1 wrote , suggesting he meant to imply that @entity33 restaurants ca n't spell " lasagna			0
" the inaccurate version spread , and @entity1 said he felt he " could n't get out of hell			0
" " comedy is treacherous , " he wrote			0
" but it 's my job to know			1
