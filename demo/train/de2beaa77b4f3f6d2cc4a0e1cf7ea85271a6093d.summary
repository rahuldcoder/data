-- @entity1 seems to be taking a beating these days			1
but guess what ? that 's actually good news			0
the world 's most famous social media company 's plummeting share price ( from $ 38 on its first trading day to $ 19 today ) is an indicator that we are not in a bubble , as investors refuse to buy into the temptation to blow tech offerings out of proportion			1
you know you are in a bubble when stocks soar regardless of intrinsic quality			0
far from it , the current market is one of @entity24 and the worst of times			1
@entity27 's value has soared because it has a clear and wildly profitable strategy			0
@entity1 , @entity29 and @entity30 sank because their strategies are unconvincing			2
put another way , companies with solid revenue models are richly rewarded while companies foolish enough to go public before proving their model are punished			0
it 's worth noting the companies that have not gone public			0
unlike @entity1 , @entity40 remains private while it continues to refine its business model			2
@entity43 social network company @entity42 sold itself to @entity44 because its founders realized that a sale was the only way to get the resources needed for growth without the risks and distractions inherent in going public			0
@entity1 's wounds are self - inflicted			1
the company did a poor job of managing its investor growth and was forced to go public because of @entity57 rules governing companies with assets of more than $ 1 billion and more than 500 shareholders			0
@entity1 compounded its misery by setting its ipo price too high and offering too many shares			1
imagine telling @entity1 underwriters and founder @entity66 : " you can either sell a lot of shares at a lower price or fewer shares at a higher price			1
" apparently the answer was : " we 'll take both			0
" the consequence was more shares , and more expensive shares , than the market could absorb			0
@entity1 thought that user popularity would translate to investor appeal and counted on its members to buy shares in the ipo			1
this is what is known as the " @entity89 effect : " a family visits @entity89 , has a wonderful time and in the glow of memory when they return home , the parents purchase a few shares , which they then hold forever			0
the @entity89 effect did n't work for @entity1 for two reasons			2
first , ordinary investors are still gun - shy after the 2008 market crash and not yet comfortable buying stocks in any volume			2
this left only professional investors whose purchase decision was unlikely to be swayed by how much they like using @entity1 to keep up with friends and family			2
worse yet , i think @entity1 has overestimated its own popularity			1
there is a difference between using @entity1 and loving @entity1			2
the company has repeatedly annoyed its users with everything from privacy policy waffles to aggressive ad placements			0
@entity1 is the @entity44 of social media ; used by everyone but truly loved by few			2
@entity1 resembles @entity44 in other ways as well			0
@entity1 's interface is nearly as clunky and inelegant as @entity122 , and like @entity44 , @entity1 is struggling to migrate off the desktop and follow its users onto mobile platforms like smartphones and tablets			1
unfortunately , @entity1 's revenue model depends on ample screen real estate in order to please advertisers without annoying users			1
ads that can be tolerated on a laptop become a major annoyance when hogging scarce and valuable space on a smartphone			0
of course @entity1 can get its groove back and it must start with leadership			1
calls for @entity66 to resign as ceo are premature and pointless , given his iron grip on voting power			0
but @entity66 must match @entity1 's growth with his own personal growth as a leader and strategist and must do it quickly			1
@entity1 also needs more talent			0
when i visited @entity1 's campus two days before its may ipo , the company had 1.5 billion users , $ 3.7 billion 2011 revenues , and less than 3,000 employees			1
that is n't lean ; it 's anorexic			0
i believe that many of @entity1 's stumbles , including its smartphone failure , are due to the simple fact that it has too few people to implement its current strategies			1
in this respect , @entity1 's weak stock value is an advantage as it can offer new hires options at prices comparable to pre-ipo rates			1
@entity1 's stumble is not evidence of a bursting bubble			1
the market may be punishing the company today , but if @entity1 can refocus and deliver , investors will be more than willing to reward it down the road			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			0
