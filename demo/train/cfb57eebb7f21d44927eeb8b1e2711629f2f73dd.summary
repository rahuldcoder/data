-- could it be that the reason our government is broken is because of which generation is running things ? authors @entity7 and @entity8 think so , insisting that the problem is that power is now firmly in the hands of self - righteous baby boomers who have spent their entire lives convinced that anyone who disagrees with them is morally inferior			1
boomers wo n't negotiate anything , @entity7 and @entity8 say , because they think every position they hold is rooted in something no less sacred than their values , and they 're understandably reluctant to negotiate their values			1
@entity7 , who worked as a policy adviser to former vice president @entity27 , and @entity8 , an expert on polling and research , insist that the situation will get better when the generational torch is passed and younger people take over			2
in their new book , " @entity41 , " they explain how the millennial generation ( born from 1982 to 2003 ) will remake @entity36 in education , politics , entertainment and every other conceivable endeavor			2
there will be more compromise , they predict , and more tolerance for different points of view			2
there will also be more of a desire to rule by consensus and not decree			2
but until that day comes , the authors told me during a recent interview , there will be gridlock and dysfunction			1
and our government will stay broken			1
i 'm not sure i 'm sold , but it 's a provocative theory			2
there are others out there as well , and i wanted to hear them			2
i have a lot of friends who are in @entity66 -- in between boomers and millennials			1
some of them are political insiders in their 30s and 40s who have worked as congressional staffers , run major political campaigns , worked in the @entity75 , or been elected to legislatures and city councils			2
they know all about government , what works and what does n't			1
so i asked some of them why our government is broken , and here are some of the reasons they gave : safe districts			1
now that the redistricting process has become all about preserving incumbency , and limiting the number of " competitive " districts that could go into either party 's column , there are fewer moderates in @entity97			2
it was bound to happen			0
once politicians start thinking in terms of creating safe @entity103 districts and safe @entity105 districts , it becomes a contest to see which candidate for a congressional seat is more of a partisan @entity103 or @entity109			0
the result : plenty of highly partisan and comfortable lawmakers who do n't have to worry about being voted out of office			0
because members of @entity97 have to stand for re-election every two years , they are in constant need of ready cash , which the candidates then turn around and spend on glossy mailers , campaign staff , and television commercials			1
besides being undignified , this dialing for dollars leaves little time to get to work on solving the nation 's problems			0
words speak louder than actions			0
somewhere along the road , lawmakers got the idea that talking about a subject was just as good as tackling it			0
on an issue like immigration , for instance , members of both parties talk endlessly -- and with every utterance , move further away from ever finding a solution			0
many people run for @entity97 because they think these are powerful positions			0
but when they arrive , they realize just how little power they have			1
the clout lies with special interests , which turn out volunteers and give money to campaigns			1
want to get education reform ? talk to the teachers unions			0
want to save @entity154 ? you 'll need to go through the senior lobby			0
all politicians have pressure points , and the special interests know just where to push			1
no matter what the issue at hand , the extreme voices tend to be the loudest -- and often the most inflexible			1
so policy debates quickly degenerate into a pair of competing and intractable positions that neither side will budge from			0
compromise is unlikely , and combat is inevitable			0
and in that environment , it 's usually all or nothing			0
no one will settle for half a loaf ; they all want the whole bakery			0
lawmakers would rather wring their hands over a problem than lay claim to a remedy that might ruffle feathers			0
they know that , if they approve a controversial bill , they have to own it for the next election			0
so , oftentimes , they would rather have an issue to bat around than risk accountability at the polls for rolling up their sleeves and working out a solution to a problem			0
the irony is that the worse government performs , the greater the public cynicism , and the less likely it is that many @entity36 will turn out to vote -- which , in turn , only makes government even worse , because it offers little incentive for politicians to do better			1
after all , as former @entity209 sen. @entity208 likes to say , politics is a contact sport : " you take part , or you get taken apart			0
" what if you were in charge ? the old saying dictates that people get the government they deserve			1
but they also get the government they 'll tolerate			1
if it 's really true that record numbers of @entity36 are fed up with their government , as the latest polls show , they have to make it known -- and make some changes			1
and one way to fix government is to replace those who are doing the governing -- whatever generation they 're from			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			1

@entity235 : two authors blame baby boomers for broken government
they say that boomers are too inflexible , see disagreement as assault on their values
he says other factors contribute to *paralysis* in @entity251
@entity235 : constant fundraising and power of special interests are *key*
