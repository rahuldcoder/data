-- it 's been more than half a century since the @entity3 military executed a service member			1
army pvt. @entity5 was hanged in 1961 at @entity7 prison in @entity8 , convicted of raping and attempting to kill an 11 - year - old @entity11 girl			1
the 26 - year - old soldier 's execution barely made the newspapers , according to a profile of @entity5 published in 2000 in the @entity16			1
but by today 's standards , it probably would have generated a huge amount of attention and controversy			2
@entity5 was black , the @entity11 girl was white , and @entity5 's defense was " brief and ineffective , " the @entity16 reported			1
the @entity16 story went on to say that during the six years between @entity5 's trial and his execution , eight other black soldiers were executed -- but the six white prisoners on death row lived			1
the white prisoners " had killed little girls or killed more than once			0
... president @entity32 commuted sentences of four			0
two were spared by the court , " the paper said			0
and there was evidence in @entity5 's case that he suffered from mental health problems that , in today 's justice system , might have spared him			1
military death row : more than 50 years and no executions the soldier 's lawyer never brought up @entity5 's mental history , and @entity5 did n't testify , the newspaper said			1
" the biggest concern with the military death penalty was that it fell disproportionately on @entity53 - @entity3 soldiers , " says @entity47 , who teaches military justice at @entity49			1
during @entity55 , blacks accounted for less than 10 % of the @entity56			0
during the war , 70 soldiers were executed in @entity59 and , of those , 55 were black , wrote @entity61 , a military law expert , for the nonprofit @entity62 , which analyzes and studies issues surrounding capital punishment			1
after president @entity67 ordered an end to segregation in the armed forces in 1948 , the racial disparity in executions increased , @entity61 said			0
between 1954 and 1961 , 11 of 12 service members executed were black			1
a 2012 study that analyzed racial disparity in military death penalty cases between 1984 and 2005 found minorities were twice as likely as whites to be given the death penalty , a finding considerably higher than in civilian courts , said @entity80 of @entity82 's @entity81 , a co-author of the study			1
as commander - in - chief , the @entity3 president is the only person who can sign a death warrant for a service member			0
@entity32 signed off on @entity5 's execution , but by the time @entity5 's final day came , president @entity90 was in office			1
" the data were sufficiently troubling that when @entity95 's case came before president @entity90 , an analysis was done of all military cases , and his staff was concerned about adverse public reaction , " @entity47 said			2
" in the end , @entity100 declined to interfere with the execution			0
" apart from the @entity16 story , few news outlets appear to have written about @entity5 , an indigent son of a @entity106 sharecropper			2
according to the paper , the ammunition handler and truck driver 's court - martial happened in @entity11			1
the trial lasted five days			0
the girl , who the @entity16 says was named @entity113 , came into contact with her attacker while she was walking across a meadow in the town of @entity118			0
residents said that a man who looked like @entity5 had stumbled into their homes , asking for a prostitute			2
@entity5 , the paper said , claimed he and the girl had consensual sex			1
later , the wife of an @entity56 sergeant , said that the girl showed up at her home and repeatedly used the word @entity131 , the @entity16 reported			0
@entity5 was charged with rape , and prosecutors added a charge of attempted murder for leaving the girl in a meadow , the newspaper said			2
@entity113 testified for the prosecution and pointed @entity5 out at the trial , according to the @entity16			2
@entity5 was in the disciplinary barracks ' boiler room at @entity7 and " waited calmly " as col. @entity143 read his sentence , according to a 1994 @entity146 article			2
@entity143 asked the condemned soldier whether he wanted to make a final statement			0
" yes , " he answered			0
" i wish to take this last opportunity to thank you and each member of the staff for all you have done in my behalf			0
" @entity155 orders review of military judicial authority @entity0 's @entity157 contributed to this report .			0
