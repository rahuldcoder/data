@entity0 -- rep. @entity3 's hoodie on the @entity5 floor sure got attention			1
" racial profiling has to stop , " he announced as he took off his suit jacket to reveal a hoodie , which he immediately pulled over his head			2
his speech was cut short by the loud clicking of a gavel , and an admonition to leave the chamber for breaching rules of decorum			1
the move was intended to highlight the @entity20 shooting case in @entity21 , but it also raised questions about attire in the @entity5			1
@entity5 officials said @entity3 broke a rule that says members " may not wear a hat			1
" another rule says representatives have to " wear appropriate business attire in the chamber			0
" in the wake of @entity3 's removal from the @entity5 , some members are complaining that rules are unevenly enforced			1
it is not unusual to see lawmakers entering the @entity5 chamber in jeans , sneakers and other clothing that is supposed to be banned			1
late last year rep. @entity42 , @entity43 , wore a memorable outfit that certainly did not qualify as appropriate business attire			1
in the politest of terms , it was a form fitting blue t - shirt underneath his blazer			0
@entity51 chairman @entity50 told @entity1 he supports the @entity5 rules aimed at proper decorum , but he also said -- in the wake of the @entity3 incident -- they must now be enforced across the board			1
" it 's not uncommon to see people in the back ( of the @entity5 chamber ) with sweatshirts on , and we have traditionally allowed that to happen			1
i do n't think that can happen anymore , " said @entity50			0
in fact , standing at the bottom of the @entity65 steps on thursday as the @entity5 was holding its final pre-recess votes , @entity50 said he had just seen people " with all kinds of things on			1
" " when you selectively enforce the rules it can cause people to believe you 're enforcing them on the basis on political view or basis of partisan politics , " @entity50 said			0
translation : @entity5 officials must start cracking down on the dress code , so no one can say @entity3 was singled out because of politics , party or race			1
house speaker @entity86 is famously fixated on appearances , stopping people in hallways and calling them out at press conferences about a bad outfit or messy hair			0
for example , earlier this month he told a reporter to button his shirt			0
" you do n't have to look like a reporter , " @entity86 quipped			0
one of @entity86 's most famous tongue - in - cheek moments was in 2009 , when he spent much of a press conference commenting on the way people looked			2
" you really do need to do something with that hair of yours , " he said to one reporter			0
" get a brush , will ya ? " he said to another			0
a natty dresser himself , @entity86 is such a stickler that minutes after an emotional farewell to @entity117 in january , he banged the gavel and bellowed , " the chair would remind all members to be in proper business attire when you come to the floor of the @entity5			1
" we asked @entity86 about @entity50 's concern that the rules are not uniformly enforced			2
" i think the rules are enforced evenly , " @entity86 replied			0
" i 've asked members of both sides of the aisle to leave the floor myself			2
i know the sergeant of arms has asked members to leave the floor			0
we expect all members to follow the rules and the rules make it clear that members will be on the floor with proper business attire , " he said			0
the day that @entity3 wore his hoodie on the @entity5 floor , several other members also brought their own sweatshirts , but did n't end up wearing them after @entity3 was escorted out for breaking the rules			1
@entity50 told @entity1 several members of the @entity51 and others had asked him to put one on , but he declined , out of respect for @entity5 decorum			2
he said @entity86 needs to tell @entity5 officials to work harder			2
" what needs to happen is the speaker is going to have to tell every sergeant at arms that no matter what , people must confirm to the rules , " @entity50 said			0
@entity1 congressional producer @entity161 contributed to this report .			0
