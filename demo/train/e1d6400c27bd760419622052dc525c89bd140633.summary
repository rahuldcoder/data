-- researchers at @entity2 debuted an experimental processor at the company 's developer forum this week , which could lead to devices with significantly lower energy consumption			2
the chip -- codenamed " @entity9 " -- is known as a near - threshold voltage processor , which allows transistors to operate at super-low , near " threshold " voltages to increase efficiency and decrease energy consumption			1
this level is very near the voltage at which transistors switch on and start conducting current , which is the " threshold " voltage			1
in the demonstration , the experimental low - power processor was used on a pc running @entity22 , powered only off a solar cell the size of a postage stamp			1
the processor was used in conjunction with another experimental project , a concept dram called the hybrid memory cube , which is a super efficient memory interface			2
" we used a solar cell in the demonstration to show how little power was required , " said @entity2 spokeswoman @entity31 in an interview			1
" but it could run on anything that has power			0
" like lemon juice , or perhaps a potato as @entity31 suggested			0
" the key message is the low power and how much more transistors would be power - efficient running at near - threshold			1
" several years of research have led to @entity2 's near - threshold voltage - processor design			1
it 's heat - sink free , and rather than operating at those super low thresholds all the time , it switches into @entity52 mode ( under 10 mw in power consumption ) when its workload is light			1
this means , rather than powering off completely , a device can stay on in an " ultra low - power state , " preserving active processes and open applications -- " always - on " devices			2
the technology could even be used to develop " zero - power " architectures " where power consumption is so low that we could power entire digital devices off solar energy , or off the energy that surrounds us every day " , like vibrations or movements , ambient wireless signals or solar power			1
@entity52 could find itself in a host of applications ranging from processors and mobile devices to embedded devices , appliances and automobiles			1
energy efficiency has always been a concern for device manufacturers and chipset makers , but as the hardware industry moves to mobile and more lightweight computing , it 's become a much bigger issue			0
so far , @entity2 has had some difficulties finding its way into mobile devices because of power consumption issues			0
its low - power competitor arm has dominated in that area , even threatening to displace it as the processor in @entity97 laptops and desktops ( according to rumor )			1
but @entity2 's latest offerings , including its @entity102 processors and @entity104 processors , have become much more efficient			0
@entity2 's latest , the @entity106 " @entity107 " transistor , also marks a major improvement , both in design , and in its 30 % improvement in performance			0
@entity52 is a significantly bigger step than these commercial processors			2
the technology results in a 5 to 10x improvement in energy consumption			0
but it 's not without problems			0
when electrical noise is introduced , logic level readings can be inaccurate			0
so the challenge is to maintain a balance of performance versus efficiency			0
" most digital designs operate at nominal voltages -- about @entity127 today			0
@entity52 circuits operate around 400 to 500 millivolts , " says @entity2 researcher @entity128 in a blog post on the subject			2
consistently running electronics at such low voltage levels is a challenge because the difference between a " 0â € ³ and a " 1â € ³ becomes very small ( electrical signal-wise )			2
@entity2 's experimental @entity52 processor may never find itself in an actual consumer product , @entity140 says , but is an important stepping stone towards future processors that will			1
