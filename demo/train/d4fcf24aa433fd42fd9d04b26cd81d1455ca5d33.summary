-- @entity2 's population may be in excess of 1.3 billion inhabitants but only two of its players had ever reached a grand slam semifinal -- until tuesday			1
that was when unseeded @entity9 put years of frustration , thoughts of retirement and major heart surgery to one side as she blew away @entity16 teen @entity15 at the @entity17			1
at her 37th grand slam , the 28 - year - old was finally into her first semifinals			1
the buildup had mainly focused on the 17 - year - old @entity15 but it was the little known @entity9 -- far more recognized as a doubles player -- who stole the show with a powerful display			1
by so doing , she follows in the footsteps of @entity26 , a two - time grand slam winner , and @entity28 , who reached semifinals at @entity30 ( 2008 ) and the @entity31 ( 2010 )			1
" it 's a little bit too exciting , " @entity9 said on court after her 6 - 2 6 - 1 victory , earning a round of applause after pausing as emotion got the better of her			1
" i love tennis , i love to play			0
" that much is clear from her back story			0
aged 12 , @entity9 went against her family wishes to undergo a major operation to repair a fault in her heart			1
the procedure was so complicated surgeons had to access her heart through her left leg but as @entity9 made clear in a 2008 advertisement , there was one fundamental reason she went through with it			2
" all i thought was very simple : if i want to continue tennis , i need to have this operation , " she said in the @entity51 advert			0
nearly two decades later , her tenacity was rewarded when she achieved the no. 1 ranking in doubles			0
by so doing , she became the first @entity2 to ever achieve top spot -- whether in singles or doubles , male or female			2
despite the ranking , a player who has never won a singles title revealed she had been wracked by doubts in recent times			0
" a career is tough sometimes , " said @entity9 in victory			2
" i 've thought about giving up , stopping playing ( singles ) , because i did n't know if i can make it , but my coach and parents told me to never give up			0
" with her two - fisted ground strokes proving too much for a rattled @entity15 , the youngest @entity17 quarterfinalist since 1997 , @entity9 hit 24 winners			1
although @entity28 was the first @entity2 player to reach a grand slam semifinal , world no. 3 @entity26 has taken the country 's tennis further			1
she won its first singles grand slam at the @entity81 , before clinching a second title at this year 's @entity31			1
no @entity2 woman has ever reached the @entity17 singles final , a record that @entity9 -- who has won two grand slam doubles titles in the last year -- will try to correct on thursday			1
she will meet 2009 finalist @entity87 , who continued her career resurgence by crushing @entity90 13th seed @entity91 6 - 0 6 - 1 later tuesday			2
the former world no. 1 , who has a 5 - 1 career record over @entity9 , reached the last four of a grand slam for the first time since 2011 , also in @entity97			1
" she was much stronger than me physically tonight , " said @entity91 , a semifinalist in 2012			0
" she does n't let you play			0
" and every point was a long point , and it made me feel worse , physically			0
" @entity100 is in action on wednesday against @entity90 's @entity102 , but she suffered a frustrating day on tuesday			0
not only did she lose her doubles quarterfinal with sister @entity104 to @entity106 pair @entity105 and @entity107 , but she also suffered an injury scare			0
the world @entity110 's right foot had to be heavily bandaged early in the second set of the 7 - 6 6 - 4 defeat			2
in the men 's event , second seed @entity114 marched into the quarterfinals for the 10th time in the last 11 years with an aggressive 6 - 4 6 - 3 6 - 2 win over @entity122 17th seed @entity120			1
the five - time @entity124 champion , seeking his first final appearance since losing the 2009 title match , came to the net 50 times as he comfortably set up a clash with @entity131 20th seed @entity129			1
" i 'm happy i 'm able to come forward now because coming to net requires a lot of agility and explosiveness , and i have it back , " said the veteran 17 - time grand slam winner			1
he has a 7 - 2 record over @entity129 , beating him in three sets on the way to winning the @entity143 title last month			0
" i know exactly how i need to play him , " @entity114 said			0
" i know i 'll be coming in ; he knows he 'll be defending			0
he 'll be wanting to serve well and play big as well			0
" @entity129 , known for his all - action style , was in impressive form as he overcame a sluggish @entity147 7 - 5 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) 7 - 5 to reach the quarterfinals at @entity149 for a third time			2
sixth seed @entity151 will play @entity154 's @entity153 in the quarterfinals , after the @entity156 beat @entity158 's @entity157 6 - 1 6 - 2 6 - 4			2
@entity153 , seeded 14th , came from behind to beat @entity159 5 - 7 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) 6 - 4 3 - 6 6 - 3 , avenging his five - set defeat by the @entity131 at january 's @entity31			0
in wednesday 's opening quarterfinals , @entity31 champion @entity161 takes on @entity165 10th seed @entity163 , then in the late session world no. 1 @entity167 plays @entity168 in a repeat of the 2012 title match .			2

@entity9 becomes only third @entity2 player to reach a grand slam semifinal
