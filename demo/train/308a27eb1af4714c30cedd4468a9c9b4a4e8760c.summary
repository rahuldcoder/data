-- when we left " @entity4 " crew in the midseason finale in december , the original survivors were coming head - to - head with the governor and his followers in the isolated community of @entity10			1
gunbattles ensued , as did dramatic rescue attempts that led to a cliffhanger involving two of the show 's central characters -- brothers @entity14 and @entity18 -- in a ring , surrounded by an angry mob calling for their heads			1
will @entity23 and the original survivors integrate into @entity10 ? or will human - on - human violence prove to be more dangerous than the roaming flesh - eaters ? @entity28 's popular zombie series resumes on sunday , and @entity0 spoke with @entity29 , executive producer and creator of the original comic book series , about what fans can expect for the last half of season 3 , life after outgoing showrunner @entity36 and how long even the undead can survive the apocalypse on tv			1
@entity0 : " @entity4 's " ratings have exploded this season			1
what 's connecting with audiences ? @entity29 : @entity28 has a really great program with building viewership			1
they do a tremendous amount of work , running marathons , promoting those marathons , promoting the dvds and working with partners like @entity52 and @entity53 to make sure everything is available			0
so while people are hearing news about the show , @entity28 is doing a really good job at helping develop the audience			1
also , we 're awesome			0
people seem to like the show			1
@entity0 : was there concern in the beginning that the adaptation might not be able to transition from the comic world to a broader audience ? @entity29 : i 'm somewhat of a pessimist			0
i never expected this to get made ; i never expected the pilot to get picked up ; i never expected the episodes to make it to air			0
i did n't really treat this show like it was happening until it premiered and until the ratings came in			1
there was a good 24 - hour period where i was thinking , " this is not going to last			0
" i think that 's relative to its success			1
there 's really nothing like this on television			1
there 's really no comparison			1
i never thought it would succeed or succeed as well it has			0
it 's all been pretty surprising			1
@entity28 took this risk and put something really unique on television , and people are responding to it on the level where it 's having other networks try to think outside the box			1
as a television fan , when i see things like " @entity108 , " these kind of crazy shows that you would n't expect to see on television , things like " the following " -- it 's really exciting to see all this new stuff coming in			1
@entity0 : obviously , the story and the art in the comic books stand out			0
is the aesthetic of the show taking a certain direction that you 're noticing ? @entity29 : not necessarily			1
we try to focus on the struggle of human survival			0
that 's really what 's at the core of this show : the appeal of watching people persevere and endure and succeed			1
this show is very much about trying to rebuild civilization in a micro sort of way			1
it 's about keeping a family together and keeping your loved ones safe			1
it 's much more about that heart and emotion than the more splashy stuff you see with the zombies , the action and the horror			1
@entity0 : the hook is " you get to see zombies eat people			0
who does n't love that ? " but there 's the mental anguish that the viewers are put through			1
@entity29 : yeah , the zombies eat people , and that 's cool and everything , but you really care about those people that are getting eaten			1
you feel for the other characters when they run around , and you hope that the rest of the characters do n't get eaten			0
that 's a very important component			1
@entity0 : as executive producer and a writer , how much input do you have on each episode that we see ? @entity29 : well , i mean , i 'm one of the writers in the writers ' room			0
there 's a piece of every writer in every episode , little suggestions here and there			2
things that make it into the final episode that we sort of throw out on the fly in the writers ' room			2
@entity187 , like all the writers , have tremendous influence in terms of what goes into the show			2
i go on set as a producer , i oversee visual effects with a lot of the other producers ; i 'm giving notes on edits and cuts			0
i work hand - in - hand with all the other executive producers and @entity36 in season 3 and craft the show into what it is			1
@entity0 : speaking of @entity205 , it was recently announced that he 'd be leaving at the end of season 3 for " creative differences			2
" where do you see the creative direction of the show going ? @entity29 : i think the creative could n't be at a better place			2
i think we have a really strong season 3			2
moving forward , it 's important to note that television is a collaborative medium , and there may be an element that changes from season to season , but the core group , the core people that make " @entity4 " what it is , changes a little bit from season to season			1
the majority of people remain , so the show is still going to have the same flavor			2
i could n't be more excited about all the things we 're going to be doing in season 4			2
@entity0 : let 's talk about the rest of season 3			1
what can viewers expect ? what are some of the issues and themes that manifest ? @entity29 : i think we have some really cool stuff ahead			0
if you 've seen the first half of the season , you know the people in @entity10 are there			2
they 're led by the governor , and they 're definitely going to be a problem			0
you got @entity23 with his people , and they 're trying to survive , and you have these two groups who are on this collision course			0
it 's going to be coming to a head			2
you 're going to see big conflicts and pretty huge stakes , and some pretty dangerous things are going to happen to these people			0
some of them may not survive			0
as fast - paced and explosive as the first half of the season has been , we 're really going to be upping the ante and escalating things where we reach a finale , where some pretty crazy stuff is going to go down			2
@entity0 : who do you think is the most compelling character at the moment ? @entity29 : it 's really hard to pick			2
i could gush about every single character			0
the work that @entity278 ( @entity279 ) is doing on @entity280 is amazing			0
i think all the actors would agree : watching his transformation over the first three seasons of this show is a really cool piece of this show			2
he 's been expanding his role in very cool ways , becoming this child soldier that we 've gotten to know			2
he 's a character that i would recommend people pay attention to and watch			2
it 's watching these characters grow and change over time			2
that 's really the core aspect , and you do n't really see that in a lot of television shows			0
when you look at season 3 , sure , @entity306 's there , @entity23 's there , @entity309 's there -- but they 're vastly different than they were in season 1			1
@entity0 : with a show that 's become so engaged with its fans , do you pay attention to reactions , either positive or negative ? @entity29 : i 've gotten the benefit of working in the comic industry for 10 years			1
i 've always been very tuned in to fan reactions , message boards and all that kind of stuff			0
i 'm pretty good at ignoring the negative comments and not letting them get me too much			0
there 's always going to be negative comments			0
honestly , i 've learned if you do n't have negativity in fan reactions , you 're just not reaching enough fans			0
with " @entity4 " being as popular as it is , i actually enjoy the negative comments			1
we 're reaching people to a point where they care so much , they voice their opinions			0
@entity0 : you 've written two novels about " @entity4			1
" have you had talks about turning those into films ? @entity29 : there 's always stuff like that thrown out , but there 's no plans like that right now			1
it 's enough for " @entity4 " to be a television show , a comic , a video game , another video game and another video game			1
there 's quite a lot going on in " @entity4 " world			1
i ca n't say there 's never going to be a movie ; it 's just not on our radar yet			1
@entity0 : in a perfect world , how many seasons do you see this show lasting ? @entity29 : i think we 'd be incredibly fortunate if we were one of those shows that got to go seven seasons			0
i think that 's a good possibility in our future , the way things are going			0
hopefully , we 'll make it there			0
at the same time , this is a very unique show			0
personally , if i could wave a magic wand , i 'd make it go 20 seasons			0
this is the kind of story that is exciting to watch these characters grown and change over time			0
the comic book has been going for a decade and probably will go for another decade , i hope			0
i have no intention of ending that any time soon			0
i think there will always be a wealth of story potential in a universe like this .			0
