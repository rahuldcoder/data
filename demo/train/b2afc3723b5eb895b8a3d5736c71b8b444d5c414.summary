-- the sharp attacks between the @entity3 frontrunners that have played out in media interviews and television ads largely took a backseat in the debate in @entity8 , @entity9			1
it was the final debate before january 's pivotal @entity9 caucuses			0
here are five things we learned from thursday night 's debate : front - runners play nice in the past week , there has been no love lost between @entity3 frontrunners @entity18 and @entity20			1
on tuesday , @entity18 called for @entity21 to return all the money he received for consulting for @entity23 , and @entity21 responded by telling reporters in @entity25 that @entity18 should return all the money he earned " bankrupting companies and laying off employees over his years " at @entity30			1
most recently , @entity18 's campaign sent @entity9 republicans a mailer featuring a half - page picture of @entity21 seated next to liberal democrat @entity35			1
but little of that enmity was visible on stage in @entity8			0
who do you think won the debate ? " i 've said consistently , these are all friends of mine , " @entity21 said , referencing his rivals on stage			1
" any of these folks would be better than @entity46 in the @entity47			0
any of them would be great in the next administration			0
" " let 's every day remember that , time and time again , it 's president @entity46 we 've got to be talking about , " @entity18 said at the end of the debate , and for the most part he stuck to his pledge			0
even when directly asked to respond to a @entity21 attack , @entity18 immediately pivoted to focus on @entity46			1
@entity21 ' editing ' words as campaign acknowledges concern perhaps @entity18 was responding to @entity21 's recent call for a positive campaign , but after the debate @entity18 's senior strategist @entity64 did not rule out future attacks			1
" he has to win a primary against six or seven other candidates and so he 's going to differentiate and distinguish himself from his competitors from time to time , " @entity64 said			0
" we 're getting closer to the first contest and i think as that happens the campaign becomes more intense and more competitive on the part of every candidate			0
" @entity76 leaps outside mainstream despite a recent surge in the polls and a growing base of support among early - state voters , @entity76 showed that he 's still out of step with the @entity3 mainstream on one major issue : foreign policy			1
@entity76 could rock @entity3 race in @entity9 @entity89 anchor @entity88 kicked off the second hour of debate by asking @entity76 if his non-interventionist position toward @entity92 means that if he got the nomination he 'd be running to the left of president @entity46			1
" but i 'd be running with the @entity96 people , because it would be a much better policy , " @entity76 said			1
he then cited the @entity98 and director of national intelligence @entity99 to argue that there is no evidence that @entity92 is even close to developing a nuclear weapon			2
" it 's no different than it was in 2003 , " @entity76 said			2
" you know what i really fear about what 's happening here ? it 's another @entity110 coming			0
there 's war propaganda going on			0
to me , the greatest danger is that we will have a president that will overreact and we will soon bomb @entity92			2
" even when @entity88 pushed him to respond to a hypothetical situation where he " had solid intelligence as president @entity76 " that @entity92 was close to building a nuclear weapon , the congressman stood firm			1
no matter the circumstances , @entity76 said he would remove all economic sanctions currently in place against @entity92 , even going so far as to compliment @entity46 for his handling of the situation -- virtual apostasy in a @entity3 debate			1
" i think he is wisely backing off on the sanctions , " @entity76 said , warning of the effects sanctions on @entity92 could have on @entity128			1
" sanctions are an act of war when you prevent goods and services from going into a country			0
we need to approach this a little differently			0
we have 12,000 diplomats in our services			0
we ought to use a little bit of diplomacy once in a while			0
" @entity76 is no stranger to going out on a limb , and although he received a smattering of applause for his principled stance , he found no agreement from his rivals on the stage			2
in fact , one of the largest cheers of the night came after when @entity156 called his position " dangerous			2
" so while @entity76 is finding traction with a growing section of libertarian - leaning @entity3 , his approach to foreign policy may still be a little too hard - line for a majority of primary voters			1
@entity156 goes on the offense @entity156 has been hovering in the bottom - tier ever since her @entity9 straw poll win in august , but she held her own on the stage in @entity8 and may have even fared better than many of her competitors			2
she had the sharpest attack lines of the night against frontrunner @entity21 : " you do n't need to be within the technical definition of being a lobbyist to still be influence - peddling with senior @entity3 in @entity176 , to get them to do your bidding			1
" the @entity181 congresswoman also drew applause when she challenged @entity76 's position on @entity92			1
" i think i have never heard a more dangerous answer for @entity96 security than the one that we just heard from @entity76 , " @entity156 said			1
@entity0 's @entity189 @entity21 dressed @entity156 down for challenging his work with mortgage giant @entity23 , saying people like her " ought to have facts before they make wild allegations			1
" @entity156 quickly deflected the criticism and charged back at the frontrunner			1
" i think it 's outrageous to continue to say over and over through the debate that i do n't have my facts right when as a matter of fact i do , " @entity156 said			2
" i 'm a serious candidate for president of the @entity96			0
and my facts are accurate			0
" but if @entity156 still feels the need to proclaim her seriousness at this point in the race , @entity9 voters may have similar concerns			2
@entity209 peaks at right time ? if only @entity209 had begun like this			2
the @entity212 governor delivered a forceful performance in a state where he hopes to reinvigorate his struggling campaign , including delivering perhaps the line of the night when he said he might just defy expectations and become the " @entity218 of the @entity9 caucuses			1
" just like for @entity218 and his fluky mechanics , expectations for @entity209 in this debate were certainly low			2
but he was warmly received by the audience on topics ranging from dismissing attorney general @entity225 to establishing a part - time @entity226 to defending the border from illegal entrants -- an issue @entity209 has worked to turn into a rhetorical strength			2
" i 've been dealing with this issue for 11 years , " he said of sealing the @entity232 border			0
" i 've sent @entity234 recon teams there			0
our law enforcement men and women face fire from across the border or in the @entity96 side from these drug cartels			0
it is not safe there			0
our country is at jeopardy			0
" at one point @entity209 , the politician with a history of verbal slips , even corrected moderator @entity250 when he misattributed a quote to @entity252			2
if @entity9 voters were impressed by @entity209 's performance , his rapid improvement as a debater may just come in time to make a difference on january 3			1
@entity258 left his heart in @entity25 @entity258 made a rare trip to @entity9 to participate in the debate , but his answers seemed directed more to the socially moderate and @entity264 voters who populate his adopted state of @entity25			1
the former @entity267 governor emphasized his conservative credentials on the economy , including instituting a flat tax in his home state and his " limited government , pro-growth " philosophy			0
asked about the @entity98 -- traditionally a punching bag for @entity3 -- @entity258 said " it serves a useful purpose in the area of peacekeeping			1
" on a question about environmental concerns overruling energy production , @entity258 called it " a delicate balance , " and espoused natural gas as one part of the solution			0
and in case anybody did n't get the message , at one point @entity258 told his colleagues on the stage : " you do n't need to pander , " he said			0
" we need to be who we are			0

@entity20 : " i 've said consistently , these are all friends of mine "
@entity76 goes against the mainstream @entity3 grain regarding the policy toward @entity92
@entity156 has the sharpest attack lines against frontrunner @entity21
@entity209 delivers a forceful performance ; @entity258 likely aims for @entity25
