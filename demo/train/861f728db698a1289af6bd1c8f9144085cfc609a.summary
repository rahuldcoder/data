@entity0 -- was saturday night some crazy bad dream ? because the @entity3 show i saw at the @entity5 on sunday night bore absolutely no resemblance to whatever it was the @entity9 crowd and i witnessed saturday			1
the entire nonsensical , rambling , random multimedia production ? scrapped			0
in its place : a live 90 - minute talk show , with @entity3 as the guest			1
from the start it was obvious a whole new show was planned			2
gone was the sadly unfunny comedian warming up the crowd			0
instead , a guy who never introduced himself to the audience was on stage at about 8:15 p.m. to introduce @entity3 to @entity0			1
( i happened to recognize him since i interviewed him the day before in @entity9 -- @entity3 's tour promoter from @entity26 , @entity27 )			1
the crowd gave the headliner a standing ovation			0
@entity3 replied , " wow ... wow , " inserting one of his trademark expletives			2
the actor and the still - unknown - to - audience " other guy " ( @entity27 ) sat down in two chairs on a spartan stage , with the audience still standing and cheering , then chanting " @entity9 sucks ! @entity9 sucks ! " " no , they do n't , " @entity3 said into the mic			1
@entity27 was now the emcee , simply asking @entity3 preplanned questions covering everything , including the " goddesses , " his marriages , his firing from " @entity46 , " troubles with the law in @entity49 , @entity50 , call girls at @entity53 's @entity52 and why he pays for sex			1
answer : " i have millions to blow , and i ran out of stuff to buy			2
" it was classic sheen -- caustically funny , crude , shocking and downright hilarious			0
he was relaxed and smoking and playing with audience members with the emcee as referee			0
he told the story of how he passed up being the original " @entity70 " so he could take a much better opportunity in " @entity67 2 , " based on his dad 's unwise advice			0
laid back and comfortable , @entity3 became the guy @entity9 came to see but did n't get			1
this was just funny , funny @entity3			2
yes , booze abounded here , too			0
and throughout , the highly intoxicated crowd was so pleased with @entity3 that many just shouted , " ( @entity77 ) @entity9 ! " it was as though the packed house of about 3,600 fans in @entity0 could n't understand how @entity9 could have booed this show			1
i wanted to stand up and scream at them , " @entity9 did n't have this show ! " and then scream back at @entity3 and the " other interviewer guy , " " can you please bring this show back to @entity9 ? " @entity86 : fans cheer @entity3 in @entity0 @entity9 was apparently some demented practice session			1
here in @entity0 , not much circuitous babble about @entity91 assassins and trolls and warlocks -- some , just not 20 - minute rants			0
@entity3 felt the love and got his game on in @entity0			2
at the merchandise stand , i bypassed the shirt that said " @entity101 " and instead bought the $ 15 dog tag , which on one side says : " @entity3 's @entity104 is not an @entity97 2011			1
" the flip side says ...			0
i 'm wearing it now			0
@entity1 's @entity108 and @entity109 contributed to this report			0

@entity3 completely *revamps* the show that *bombed* in @entity9
he turns his " @entity104 " tour into a talk show
why does he pay for sex ? he " ran out of things to buy , " he says
