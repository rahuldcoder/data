@entity0 -- the widow of poisoned @entity4 spy @entity3 asserted tuesday that only a public inquiry will bring her justice in the death of her husband			1
" i still believe in @entity10 justice			1
it 's not easy because i did n't expect this long wait , " @entity3 said outside the @entity11 after a pre-inquest hearing tuesday			2
@entity3 wants a public inquiry instead of an inquest , which , in @entity10 , is a proceeding to establish the facts around a sudden or unexplained death			1
a public inquiry is a different proceeding that would " enable the fullest possible investigation " into @entity3 's death and , unlike an inquest , can receive evidence behind closed doors , the coroner said during tuesday 's hearing			1
in @entity3 's case , such evidence could involve matters of national security			1
on tuesday , coroner sir @entity31 said he is waiting for a response from the secretary of justice on his petition last week to hold a public inquiry instead of an inquest			1
@entity3 , a former @entity38 agent and fierce critic of @entity4 president @entity40 , came to @entity10 in 2000 after turning whistle - blower on the @entity42 , the @entity38 's successor			1
he died at a @entity0 hospital november 23 , 2006 , after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium - 210 while drinking tea at the @entity47 in @entity0 's @entity48			0
in a deathbed statement , @entity3 blamed @entity40 , an accusation the @entity51 has strongly denied			2
@entity3 's lawyer , @entity52 , said during tuesday 's hearing the widow would be unable to play a role in an ongoing proceedings if the government refused the coroner 's request			1
" the inquest should now stand adjourned			0
there should be a full stop at the inquest until the matter is resolved , " @entity52 said			0
@entity64 , a lawyer representing the home secretary at the hearing , said a decision on a public inquiry would be made as quickly as possible			1
@entity52 charged tuesday that a foreign office minister made what he said was an " improper approach " to @entity3 's widow while @entity10 prime minister @entity71 and @entity40 met in @entity72 , @entity4 , last month			1
the representative approached the widow without reaching her legal team first , @entity52 said			0
he wanted assurances for @entity3 that discussions in @entity72 would not affect the government 's attitude to a full investigation into her husband 's death , @entity52 added			1
" i have to say i am astonished , " @entity31 said about the contact			0
@entity64 said nothing improper occurred			0
" the foreign office knew that there was likely to be some reporting in the public press of a meeting between @entity94 ministers and @entity4 officials about security matters			1
as a matter of simple courtesy , the minister telephoned mrs. @entity3 to let her know of the fact of the meeting , not to discuss the contents , but simply to inform her , " @entity64 said			2
the next hearing into the case is expected in early july			0
prosecutors in @entity0 want @entity4 to extradite @entity105 , suspected in the killing , but @entity4 has repeatedly refused to do so			0
in another hearing last december , the counsel to the inquest , @entity109 , said evidence provided by the @entity10 government shows @entity4 involvement in the former @entity38 agent 's death and " does establish a prima facie case as to the culpability of the @entity4 state in the death of @entity3			1
" in that hearing , @entity52 said @entity3 was working for the @entity10 intelligence service @entity121 and had been tasked by @entity121 with working also for the @entity123 intelligence service as it investigated @entity4 mafia activities in @entity123			1
while ill in the hospital , @entity3 called @entity105 about a planned trip together to @entity123 , a phone call that was witnessed by his wife , @entity52 said			2
the men were both to provide intelligence to the @entity123 prosecutor investigating @entity4 mafia links to the @entity51 and to @entity40 , @entity52 said			0
in march , exiled @entity4 oligarch @entity134 was found dead in the @entity10 , and his death was deemed " consistent with hanging " with no sign of a violent struggle , @entity10 investigators said			2
but the death of @entity134 , 67 , triggered speculation about the fate of a onetime tycoon known for his opposition to @entity40			0
@entity134 also blamed the @entity51 for the death of @entity3			2
for years , @entity134 bankrolled the effort of @entity3 's widow to push for an inquest into her husband 's death			1
last month , @entity149 , international editor of @entity150 , told @entity1 's @entity151 that @entity3 was a former security official -- akin to an @entity153 agent			2
" he annoyed the @entity51 in lots of ways			0
he had been involved in domestic power battles in the @entity51 , where he complained about the role of organized crime inside the @entity4 security service			0
he then defected very publicly , " said @entity149 , author of " deception : the @entity161 of @entity162			0
" " in effect they used a ... radioactive weapon , a weapon of terror against a @entity10 citizen in broad daylight in the streets of @entity0 endangering lots of other people , " @entity149 said			2
" i think we still do n't quite understand what the @entity4 motivation was			0
what we do know is that the @entity10 government does n't want to get into detail about how they know about it , and that to me suggests that they were tapping @entity4 phones , reading @entity4 diplomatic communications , bugging @entity4 officers			0
" @entity1 's @entity182 reported from @entity0 and @entity183 wrote and reported from @entity184 .			0
