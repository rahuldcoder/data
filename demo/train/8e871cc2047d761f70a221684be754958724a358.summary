@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and @entity4 , one experienced and the other almost a rookie , started as clear crowd favorites in the men 's and women 's finals at @entity0 this weekend			1
they went 0 - for - 2 -- but in contrasting fashion			0
after @entity4 was crushed by @entity12 on saturday , @entity3 was only just denied a record eighth title at the @entity14 by @entity15 in a classic sunday that saw the duo combine for 143 winners and a smallish 56 unforced errors			1
the @entity20 prevailed 6 - 7 6 - 4 7 - 6 5 - 7 6 - 4 , disappointing most on @entity21 who backed @entity3 on every shot -- especially when he fell behind 2 - 1 in sets			1
the higher - profile guests in tennis ' grandest arena included @entity28 and the @entity29 and @entity30			0
the partisans almost got their way too since @entity3 had the advantage in the fifth after he rallied from 5 - 2 down in the fourth , saving a match point with an ace originally called long			1
he was thus on the verge of becoming the first man since 1948 to win a @entity0 final after fending off a match point			2
" i kept believing and trying to play offensive tennis , " @entity3 , watched by his young twin daughters , told reporters			2
" i 'm happy it paid off in some instances			0
" as you can imagine , i 'm very disappointed not being rewarded with victory			0
" had @entity15 lost -- and do n't forget he entered the record books for the wrong reason last year when he was on the other side of the net as @entity53 ended a 77 - year @entity55 drought -- it would have gone down as one of the biggest chokes in grand slam history			1
ultimately , @entity15 also prevented @entity3 -- a month away from his 33rd birthday -- from becoming the oldest men 's @entity0 champion in the @entity63 and claiming a record - extending 18th major			1
" i could have easily lost my concentration in the fifth and handed him the win , but i did n't and that 's why the win has special importance to me , " @entity15 told reporters			2
it might have been the @entity74 ' last realistic opportunity to capture a grand slam , though he has been brushed aside before only to rebound			1
as for @entity15 , with the boost of confidence he 's sure to receive by bagging a seventh grand slam crown , he 'll be hard to stop at the @entity79 and beyond			1
perhaps he can replicate his 2011 form , when he won @entity0 , the @entity79 and @entity81			2
" when @entity15 was no. 1 in 2011 , there was no no. 2 or no. 3 , " @entity82 , one of those tied with @entity15 on seven majors , told @entity2			2
" i think @entity15 has the game to not only be no. 1 in the world but remove the challengers that are behind him			2
" he has a chance to do that again , especially as the next six , eight , nine months are on his favorite ( hard - court ) surface			0
i think he can just run away with things now for the next nine months until we get back to the clay - court season			0
" @entity15 badly needed this title , as he acknowledged , given he had lost his last five grand slam finals outside @entity100			1
as a bonus , he replaces @entity102 as the world @entity87			0
the pressure on his coach , @entity105 , will dip now , if only slightly			0
judging by his shoddy semifinal performance against @entity107 , not many would have picked @entity15 to win a second @entity0 title			1
he led by a set then allowed the @entity110 to find his way into the encounter			0
it turned into a four - set struggle			0
slips on friday rendered @entity15 frustrated and he took two bad falls sunday , one necessitating a medical timeout in the fifth			0
when @entity3 broke back early in the fourth set , @entity15 was dragged into another dogfight			1
instead of winning in five sets , @entity15 could have won in three in the pair 's 35th meeting and first in a grand slam final since the @entity125			1
" i felt like all the sets were very close for me to take , " said @entity15			1
consistently in @entity3 's service games in the first , @entity15 nonetheless fell behind 3 - 0 in the tiebreak			1
he surged , holding a set point on his own serve , but was pegged back to 6 - 6 with a @entity3 forehand down the line			1
@entity3 saved another set point with an ace , winning the last three points of the tiebreak			1
all the energy -- mentally perhaps more than anything else -- took a toll on @entity3 and the first break of the match handed @entity15 a 2 - 1 lead in the second			1
it was an advantage he would never relinquish and by the end of the third set , he had n't been broken			0
prior to @entity15 's meltdown in the fourth , it seemed like the third - set tiebreak would prove pivotal			1
@entity3 's forehand went awry and with three misses , @entity15 took that tiebreak 7 - 4			1
@entity3 's partnership with @entity150 -- one of the best volleyers in tennis history and @entity105 's rival during their playing days -- has seen him charging forward more			0
he enjoyed success at the net in the first set , winning 71 % of net points , but the number dwindled to 60 % in the second and 50 % in the third			0
the figure rose in the fourth , diminishing in the fifth			0
the stage was set for @entity15 in the fourth			2
hitting with more zip from the baseline and with @entity3 losing sting on his serve , he broke for 3 - 1			2
when @entity3 broke back for 2 - 3 it was temporary respite since @entity15 upped his game to move to the verge of the @entity171 at 5 - 2			1
but he faltered trying to serve it out at 5 - 3 , beginning with a forehand error with @entity3 stranded			2
the drama was nothing compared to the 10th game			0
down the match point , @entity3 struck a serve down the middle called long			0
@entity3 -- a traditionalist not in favor of @entity181 when it was introduced -- challenged and to his utter relief , was correct			0
he held for 5 - 5			0
a predictably out - of - sorts @entity15 immediately dropped serve and @entity3 sealed the fourth			1
" it 's really only until the fourth set when i was down a break that i started to understand more how to return him , which was a surprise for me because i 've played him that many times , " @entity3 said			2
a toilet break ensued for @entity15 , aiding no doubt to clear his head			0
he saved the first break point of the fifth at 3 - 3 with a fine inside - out forehand but was trumped in the next game as @entity3 saved three -- one thanks to an outstanding low volley			2
they ticked on until the 10th game , when @entity3 buckled			0
serving second in the set and now not able to generate free points on his serve , @entity15 pounced			2
@entity3 netted a backhand to @entity15 's joy on a second match point and @entity15 celebrated minutes later by eating the grass a la 2011			1
he dedicated the win to his late , first coach , @entity207			0
" this has been the best quality grand slam final i 've ever been part of , " said @entity15			1
for @entity3 , it was his second loss in a @entity0 final in nine tries			1
" i 'm very happy to see that with feeling normal i can produce a performance like i did the last two weeks , " said @entity3 , troubled by a bad back in 2013			0
" that clearly makes me believe that this was just a steppingstone to many more great things in the future			0
" to that end , the fans hope to see him in a 10th final next year -- and emerge as the winner .			0
