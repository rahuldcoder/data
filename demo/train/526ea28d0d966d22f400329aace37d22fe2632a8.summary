-- @entity1 is so dominant in @entity2 right now that his rivals must be hoping for help from the heavens , but even the weather seems unlikely to stop the @entity8 driver from a fourth successive win at sunday 's @entity10			1
a typhoon had been forecast to hit this week in @entity12 , but conditions have died down -- although there is still a possibility of rain during the race			2
@entity1 , however , was unconcerned after clinching his sixth pole position of 2013 with another commanding performance in saturday 's qualifying at the @entity21			1
the @entity22 headed off @entity24 ' @entity23 , who was fastest in friday 's second practice , while @entity8 teammate @entity26 was third fastest -- though the @entity27 will start 13th on the grid after his third reprimand of the season at @entity31			1
interactive : @entity2 gears up for more @entity33 " it 's not a disaster if it starts to rain , " @entity1 told reporters after setting pole for the third successive race , at a venue where he has won the past two years			1
" same as usual we have rain tires in the garage but obviously they 're talking about heavy wind			2
" i arrived on wednesday and it was very , very windy			2
since then the wind seems to have died down and i think the typhoon has changed direction			2
i think tomorrow should be fine in terms of conditions -- whether it is dry or wet			0
" if we get some of the rain from the typhoon is n't 100 % clear at the moment but , as i said , it does n't matter			0
most important is that we did the job			0
" @entity23 also had five pole positions going into qualifying , but was just over two - tenths of a second slower than @entity1 -- who leads the championship by 60 points as he seeks a fourth successive world title			1
" we did as good a job as we could , " said 2008 world champion @entity23			1
" i felt like i got the most out of the car and perhaps there 's always a little bit of room to improve but in general it 's been a good weekend so far , so i really hope that tomorrow we 're able to fight with them			1
" @entity26 is paying the price for receiving a lift from @entity72 's @entity71 following his car 's late failure in @entity31 , an act of friendship that left both drivers in trouble with the race stewards			1
" we had to take a bit of pace out of the car for qualifying			0
not much but just looking at how we would compromise qualifying a little bit more for the race , " said the 37 - year - old , who has six races left before quitting @entity2 to drive for @entity88 in the @entity89			0
" i think the race will be interesting			0
obviously well and truly out of position but we will fight and come back through			0
" @entity93 ' @entity92 will head the second row after qualifying fourth , followed by @entity24 ' @entity95 and @entity71 -- who criticized tire supplier @entity97 after being more than 0.8 seconds slower than @entity1			1
" it 's a tire that can not do five kilometers			2
if you push them , you finish them -- which is not normal , " said the two - time world champion , who won the inaugural @entity21 race in 2010			0
" i 'm sure all the cars , if they pushed 100 % from the start of a lap , they would not do five kilometers			2
so it is not very helpful and not very nice to drive like this , at 95 % of the lap. " we are getting used to them being unable to last one lap , getting used to these marbles ( rubber debris on the track ) so you have two meters of racing line			0
three or four years ago no - one would have thought this was possible			0
" @entity71 's teammate @entity122 will start sixth ahead of @entity124 's @entity123 and @entity125			1
@entity126 , who will replace @entity122 at @entity72 next year , will be ninth ahead of the @entity129 duo of @entity130 and @entity131 .			0
