-- @entity1 has responded to complaints that some photos taken with the @entity5 show a purple flare , saying it happens to many smartphones when they 're aimed near a light source like the sun. " most small cameras , including those in every generation of @entity5 , may exhibit some form of flare at the edge of the frame when capturing an image with out - of - scene light sources , " the company wrote in the support section of its website			1
" this can happen when a light source is positioned at an angle ( usually just outside the field of view ) so that it causes a reflection off the surfaces inside the camera module and onto the camera sensor			0
" @entity1 suggested keeping bright light from shining into photos taken with the phone			1
readers : smartphone zombie apocalypse ? " moving the camera slightly to change the position at which the bright light is entering the lens , or shielding the lens with your hand , should minimize or eliminate the effect , " the post said			0
not surprisingly , some users were n't satisfied with the response			0
" you got ta be kidding me apple			0
now i have to protect the camera with my hand when i want to take a picture ? " one user wrote in a thread on @entity1 's user forums			2
" when a new @entity5 comes out , i always buy it			2
if there is anyone from @entity1 reading this , i have to tell you that i am pretty disappointed with the product , for the first time			2
" wrote another : " this purpling has nothing to do with pointing the @entity5 at direct sunlight			2
you can see this purple is occurring in more than just the bright light scenarios			2
" some have speculated that the problem is caused by a sapphire cover that @entity1 added to the phone 's camera			1
" the new @entity78 camera in @entity5 features a sapphire crystal lens cover that is thinner and more durable than standard glass with the ability to provide crystal clear images , " @entity1 wrote in promotional material for the phone			1
how @entity1 has changed under @entity83 some users also suggested in the forums that a third - party filter on the lens might help			1
released septermber 21 , the @entity5 has been @entity1 's biggest product launch to date , with more than 5 million sold over its first weekend on the market			1
but , as often is the case with new tech products , there have been a handful of persistent complaints about the @entity5			0
among them , some users have said the phone 's new aluminum casing scratches and dents easily			0
and @entity1 's new map app , which replaced @entity100 for the first time , has been so glitchy that ceo @entity83 issued an apology			0
but , overall , reviews have been positive			0
and on friday , respected product testers @entity104 gave the phone a thumbs - up , calling it the best iphone yet after running a battery of tests			0
" a larger , 4 - inch display ; a thinner and lighter profile ; @entity115 access ; and a host of innovative features all helped the @entity5 move up in the ranks , surpassing not only the previous @entity119 but also a number of other new @entity122 - based smart phones , " @entity104 wrote on its website			1
in its review , @entity104 actually gave high praise to the phone 's 8 - megapixel camera			0
did @entity1 's fanboy fever peak with @entity128 ? " in the full battery of tests we give to smartphone cameras , the @entity5 's camera proved capable of capturing beautifully sharp and vibrant photos , " the report read			1
@entity104 also gave high marks to the phone 's new turn - by - turn gps navigation ( a feature @entity122 phones already had ) and its larger 4 - inch screen			1
of the map app , @entity104 found it " competent enough , even if it falls short of what 's available for free on many other phones , " and said it expects @entity1 to improve it			1
the phone did not , however , top @entity104 ' smartphone rankings			0
the @entity147 retained the top spot , and the @entity149 also got a higher overall score from the group than the @entity5			1
move over @entity5 : in @entity153 , it 's cool to call on ' @entity154 '			0

@entity1 *acknowledges* purple flare problem on @entity5
company calls problem common with phones , advises users to shield it from light
still , @entity104 says new @entity5 is a *winner*
