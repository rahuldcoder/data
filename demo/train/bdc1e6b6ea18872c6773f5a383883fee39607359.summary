-- in different year , the race for attorney general in @entity3 might have been just a footnote to the presidential election			2
but more people in the @entity3 voted tuesday for @entity7 to be their attorney general than voted for @entity9 to be their president			1
and much of that may be attributed to the furor over the @entity14 child sex case			1
she beat the @entity17 challenger , @entity16 , by almost 15 points , and the overwhelming support makes her the first woman and the first @entity21 elected to the job in @entity3			1
what may have pushed @entity24 over the top was her strong stance on the @entity14 scandal			1
she promised to look back to november 2008 , when the first victim came forward , and carry out an independent review into why @entity14 was not charged until three years later			1
" we need an independent investigator to look at what happened , " @entity24 told @entity0			0
" over 3 million people feel that i am that independent investigator			0
" her promise means she 'll be taking on the state 's sitting governor , @entity36			2
and her review into the @entity14 case investigation will delve into the years that @entity36 was the attorney general			1
he launched the @entity14 investigation before he ran for governor			1
despite some criticism , @entity36 has denied that politics had anything to do with investigative decisions			2
instead , he accused @entity46 of politicizing the case when two leading state @entity46 lawmakers wrote a three - page letter asking @entity52 attorney general @entity51 to look into how the @entity14 investigation unfolded			1
@entity51 's office says the letter is under review			0
it 's a topic that comes up at almost every news conference @entity36 holds â € ” no matter the stated topic			0
" i challenge anybody out there who says there is to bring forward one piece of evidence , one sentence of evidence , one thread of evidence , " @entity36 said in october , defending his handling of the investigation			0
criticism of @entity36 emerged soon after @entity14 's arrest last year , when the school 's faithful began to question his role on the university @entity74 , which had fired the @entity77 ' long - time football coach , @entity76			1
@entity24 said most of the questions she received during more than 20 months on the campaign trail were about @entity14			1
" everywhere i went , people from every profession , almost every county , asked me what happened and why it took so long and how i felt about it , because they knew i specialized in the prosecution of child sex abuse cases , " she said			2
" it was something that bothered them			0
it was something that was on their mind			0
" with good reason , she said : the delay in making an arrest meant that the predator remained free for years			0
during that time , investigators issued no subpoenas to @entity14 's charity , @entity103 , even though that 's where he met his first accuser			1
it took investigators looking into the november 2008 accusation 25 months to find a 1998 @entity111 police report in which two boys had accused @entity14 of having touched them inappropriately in a campus shower			1
in addition , no one from @entity111 testified before the grand jury until last year , even though @entity14 had worked there for decades			1
but almost immediately after @entity36 took office in january 2011 , eight state police troopers were added to the case			1
seven of the eight initial accusers were found in the second 18 months of the investigation			0
@entity36 's spokesman , @entity124 , said each move was strategic and that the governor handled the case responsibly			2
" if @entity7 can transition from a partisan politician to a professional prosecutor and put aside her hyperpartisan views of law enforcement , hopefully she will learn how a sophisticated and complex investigation into a serial pedophile was conducted , " @entity124 told @entity0 thursday			1
@entity24 may be a political novice , but she 's been a prosecutor since 1995 , when she left a @entity135 law firm to return home to @entity137 , where she took a job as an assistant district attorney in @entity140			2
she said it paid half of what she had made in @entity135 and she had to share her desk with another prosecutor			0
but she stayed in @entity137 to raise her two boys , @entity148 , 11 , and @entity149 , 10 , she said			0
during 17 years there , she has prosecuted public corruption cases as well as hundreds of cases involving child rape , abuse and neglect , she said			0
" they are very labor - intensive , " she said			0
" you need to have a strong stomach , and you need to know that , no matter who it is , you have to follow the facts			0
i 've done that before and i 'll do it again			0
" when she starts the job in january , @entity24 will acquire the ongoing @entity14 grand jury investigation , plus the prosecution of three former @entity111 officials , each of whom is charged with conspiracy , obstruction of justice , child endangerment , perjury and failure to report a crime			1
attorneys for those men have asked a judge to delay the scheduled january trial date			2
@entity14 was convicted in june on 45 counts of child sex abuse , ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse , which were laid out in graphic testimony by his accusers over the course of the less - than - two - week trial			2
he was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison .			0
