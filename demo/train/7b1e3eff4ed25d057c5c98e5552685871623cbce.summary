@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 voters were heading to the polls on sunday with their main choices to lead the next government a @entity8 - backed alliance or a @entity10 - backed coalition			1
@entity8 party workers in the southern town of @entity13 hope for an election victory			1
analysts say the race will be tight , with the @entity8 - dominated " march 8 alliance " possibly winning a majority of seats in parliament			1
the polls opened at 1200 gmt and will close 12 hours later			0
turnout is expected to be high among the country 's 3 million registered voters			1
about 50,000 troops were on the streets , but the run - up to the balloting had been free of violence			1
the vote comes at a critical time for @entity1 as it sits amid a power struggle between a weakened @entity34 government and a stronger @entity36 @entity8 political bloc that has gained political momentum in recent years			1
the @entity10 considers @entity8 -- which is supported by both @entity38 and @entity39 -- to be a terrorist organization			1
the group grew in popularity after its militant wing claimed victory over @entity44 after a 34 - day military conflict in 2006			2
since then , it has been more widely perceived by its supporters to be the " defenders " of @entity1			0
though @entity10 president @entity50 did n't mention the @entity1 general election in his address on thursday , he did call for religious tolerance in the @entity55 world , noting sectarian clashes between @entity57 and @entity55 and the struggles faced by religious minorities			0
" the richness of religious diversity must be upheld -- whether it is for @entity66 in @entity1 or the @entity67 in @entity68 , " he said , referring to @entity61 groups in those countries			0
" and if we are being honest , fault lines must be closed among @entity71 as well , as the divisions between @entity57 and @entity55 have led to tragic violence , particularly in @entity74			0
" in @entity1 's unique power - sharing government , the presidency is reserved for @entity66 , the speaker of parliament is always a @entity55 , and the prime minister is a @entity80			2
the law was created to balance power among @entity1 's three main religious groups			2
analysts say the @entity8 - dominated " march 8 alliance " may win a parliamentary majority with the support of @entity61 opposition leader gen. @entity87 -- the only prominent @entity61 politician to back the bloc			1
" they keep trying to scare the @entity61 voters with their stories about @entity8 's weapons , so to all of those who complain about @entity8 , can they tell us how they will disarm the party , " @entity87 told supporters friday			1
" @entity8 's weapons will no longer be a problem when the causes behind its existence disappear , including the borders ' issues			1
" a close look at @entity1 's political landscape reveals that the country 's @entity61 voters are split on how they will cast their ballots			1
some @entity61 voters want their representatives to step out of the shadows of @entity8 and @entity111 , who leads the @entity57 - dominated " march 14 coalition			1
" christian voters are divided between supporting @entity87 and other @entity61 leaders who want @entity8 to disarm			1
" in these elections , @entity61 look more divided than ever while others seem more unified than ever , " said @entity116 , a senior fellow at the @entity117			0
for the @entity50 administration , the elections could be indicative of the president 's odds of pushing stability in the region			0
former @entity10 president and @entity128 @entity127 said the @entity10 should work with whichever coalition wins			0
@entity127 was in @entity0 as part of more than 200 international observers monitoring the election			0
he also oversaw balloting in @entity134 during the elections in the @entity137 territory in january 2006			0
the @entity137 militant group @entity138 won that race " fairly and squarely " by a huge margin , @entity127 said			0
the @entity10 and @entity44 later refused to recognize the legitimacy of the @entity138 win			0
" and it 's resulted in a split in the @entity137 and a very difficult situation there , " @entity127 added			0
" i think they ( the @entity10 ) learned a hard lesson that they should accept the results of an election			0
" two senior @entity50 administration officials -- secretary of state @entity152 and vice president @entity153 -- have visited @entity1 in recent months , signaling concerns with a possible @entity8 victory			2
during his trip to @entity0 two weeks ago , @entity153 warned the country that while the @entity10 supports @entity1 's democratic process , it will reconsider its assistance to the country if its next government strays from certain " fundamental principles			2
" @entity153 's visit followed @entity165 's april trip to @entity0 in which she called for an " open and free " election without outside interference -- a veiled reference to @entity39 and @entity38			0
such rhetoric has been dismissed by @entity8 leader @entity171 as " meddling			2
" the @entity8 leader has been increasingly vocal in the lead - up to the election , blasting the current government as powerless			1
however , part of the reason @entity1 's government is crippled is that it made concessions to @entity8 -- including giving them veto power -- in order to end a political stalemate that boiled over into violence of historic proportions last year			1
while some analysts are concerned @entity8 could gain more control over @entity1 's government after sunday 's vote , a key @entity1 politician , @entity189 , warned that assessment may be misleading			1
@entity189 , who opposes the march 8 alliance , said talk of @entity8 's possible victory may be based on " rumors " and propaganda being spread by the @entity55 militia and their political allies			1
" they ( @entity8 ) think they can scare many but no one is scared , " @entity189 told @entity2			2
" they can spread all kinds of rumors on their four tv stations saying that they will win this upcoming elections			0
" @entity189 , whose father , @entity206 , was @entity1 's president in the 1950s , is running for a seat in parliament			0
even if a @entity8 - dominated government does move in , it could have trouble working with @entity61 and @entity80 politicians who -- under @entity1 law -- must participate in the government			1
it would also be difficult to find a @entity57 political figure willing to serve as prime minister in a @entity8 - led government since the majority of @entity1 's prominent @entity57 politicians are aligned with @entity111 's march 14 coalition , which has declared it will not participate in any government if @entity8 wins			1
@entity1 's political landscape could be shifting after a similar shift in neighboring @entity44			0
voters in the jewish state overwhelmingly supported conservative parties over more moderate groups , bringing into power prime minister @entity230 earlier this year			0
@entity230 is viewed in the @entity233 world as more hawkish than his predecessor , @entity234 , who ordered the war against @entity8 in 2006			2
a @entity8 victory in @entity1 could further inflame tensions with @entity44 , particularly with an estimated 30,000 rockets pointed at @entity44 from southern @entity1 -- all under the control of @entity8			2
@entity2 's @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 contributed to this report .			0

analysts say the race will be tight
some say the @entity8 - dominated alliance may win a parliamentary majority
turnout is expected to be high among the country 's 3 million registered voters
about 50,000 troops *deploy* to the streets
