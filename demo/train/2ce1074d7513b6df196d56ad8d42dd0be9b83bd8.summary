-- when @entity2 chose @entity3 , the @entity5 electronica production team of @entity6 and @entity7 , to open for them on their 2009 @entity10 tour , they did n't know it would be just the beginning of their musical collaboration			1
but , as mutual fans , with front man @entity16 enjoying @entity3 ' work with singer @entity18 and @entity6 's love of the seminal albums " violator " and " @entity22 , " it was only a matter of time			1
following in their tradition of joining forces with high - profile guest vocalists , @entity3 turned their attention to @entity16 for their latest album , " @entity33 the dead can see			1
" @entity0 recently spoke to @entity16 about what inspired the soaring new songs , what fans can expect from the new @entity37 being recorded now and how " @entity40 " changed his life			1
@entity0 : how did working on this album compare to recording a @entity2 or solo record for you ? it seems like a big enough task to have one great idea , never mind be able to parcel them out to different projects like you do			1
@entity16 : it 's interesting that you said that about the one good idea			1
with " presence of @entity56 , " for instance , it 's one phrase or one sentence and the way i sing that			1
the notes that i choose to sing will sometimes do it			1
if i get that one line , i 'm like , yes ! that leads me somewhere else			1
that 's when things start getting really exciting			1
the stuff with @entity6 was a different process for me			1
i never sat down and said , ok , i 'm writing songs now for this or for that			1
i was n't choosing this subject or that subject			1
it seemed to work with the music and i did n't want to edit that			1
i did n't want to bend it into a different direction			1
it was really a pure process , and i think you hear that			1
" @entity85 " was one of the first things i worked on			1
when i sent it back to @entity6 , he was blown away by what i 'd done over the guitar chords he 'd given to me and it started the process between us			1
these songs really kind of wrote themselves			1
i ca n't describe it in any better way			1
i just had to get out of the way , really			2
@entity0 : speaking of blessed , you explore spirituality on this album , especially on " presence of @entity56 , " and have said that may make people uncomfortable			1
sure , it 's more direct than what @entity2 usually does , but was it really such a major departure ? @entity16 : not at all			1
i think that 's because @entity106 [ @entity107 ] and i shake from the same hip as well			2
in the past , especially in the " violator " and " @entity22 " period , i felt like @entity106 was writing songs about me or for me			2
he was n't really ; i was younger then			2
but we had those same doubts , and quite often seemed to experience the same weird , dark sense of humor			2
" @entity122 " is really that understanding that sometimes when you step out of your own shoes and just open your ears and listen to what 's going on around you , you get answers to the questions you were asking			2
the title " @entity124 " works so well because sometimes when you 're still and not trying to steer things in a certain way is really when the magic can happen			2
it 's when i 'm trying to figure that out for myself that i get into all kinds of trouble			2
@entity0 : it 's a delicate balance to explore these subjects in your lyrics and not alienate the audience by coming across as tortured or preachy			2
how did you manage to pull it off ? @entity16 : i 'm glad you heard that			1
there was no torture at all			2
it really came easy , this stuff			2
for me , that doubt and that faith are so close			2
it 's impossible to deny that happening around you when you really kind of let go of trying to control things			2
but it 's not hokey in any way			2
i 'm not trying to tell you what to do			2
it 's purely my experience of feeling like i really belong , and then moments of really what the f -- k am i doing ? we all have that			2
i tried to keep that as open as possible without directing			0
i do n't want to direct you			0
i want you to listen and conjure up your own thoughts			0
@entity0 : the album is beautiful -- both melancholy and uplifting at the same time			1
how did you go about hitting those emotional nerves ? @entity16 : i think some of that stuff comes from the way i used my voice			1
i go to a very visual place when i 'm singing			0
it 's very cinematic and i get this feeling of space			0
i love when music does that			0
i listened to @entity40 a lot when i was a teenager			0
the place that he seemed to be singing from is the place that i wanted to go to			0
i did n't know if that place really existed , but i believed it did			0
i tried to capture that same magic again on this record			0
it 's a place you go to when you listen , where you just feel a sense of belonging			0
or , not feeling a sense of belonging and that being ok			0
@entity0 : is there any one @entity40 line , image or album that was able to transport you more than others ? @entity16 : there 's many records that have been pivotal for me			1
if i were to name one , it would be " @entity40			0
" it changed my life			0
the same thing happened when punk rock came along and i heard the @entity201 for the first time			0
i was 16 or 17 years old			0
it made me feel like i belonged to something			0
music has always done that and continues to do that for me			0
lately , a record that i bought that i 'm really listening to a lot is the new @entity211 album , " @entity212			1
" there 's a sense of humor to me in the combination of his words and his musical styles			0
it just spoke to me and brought a smile to my face			0
some may listen to that record and not get the same feeling , but it 's really uplifting and a beautiful record			0
@entity0 : you are currently recording your 13th @entity2 album			1
can you give us a hint about what we can expect ? @entity16 : @entity106 's been particularly prolific , and myself as well			1
i was doing the @entity3 thing and writing demos for @entity2 with a friend			1
@entity106 got on a writing streak			0
he 's got some really great songs			0
we usually start a record with six or seven songs ; we currently have about 20			0
in the studio , we 're trying to not over-fuss things			0
we 're trying to not over-produce the sound			0
if something 's working , we 're just recording it			1
we 're trying to get the element of performance into the record more			0
we 've already been talking to @entity248 about some ideas we have about where we want to take the record visually and he usually has a pretty great angle			0
the songs have a bluesy influence			0
obviously , it 's not a blues record , but there 's definitely some of those influences there			0
and it has a kind of soulful feel as well			0
it 's still early so it 's difficult to tell at this stage			0
we 've been making records for a long time together , but there 's always an element of surprise when it comes to the way a @entity2 record is really going to sound -- even for ourselves .			1
