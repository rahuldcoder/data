-- in a city known more for hiking trails than fashion runways , photographer @entity1 scours the streets for style			1
" it 's a fairly remote place , way out in the west , " he said			2
" but people in @entity10 have great taste			1
" @entity12 , 65 , relocated to @entity14 's capital from @entity15 in 2005			1
love for a @entity10 woman -- which eventually turned to marriage -- lured him from the city he admired for diversity and energy			1
he 'd spend days roaming bustling neighborhoods , snapping photos of @entity26 in goggles , drag attire and lion headpieces			0
now , he lingers around the @entity30 in downtown @entity10 , aiming his @entity32 digital slr camera at pedestrians turned models			1
" @entity10 is slower - paced , more homogenous and less densely populated than @entity15 , and this makes the fashion crowd stand out much more , " @entity12 said			1
" the fashionistas are fewer in number , but they are as creative and fashion savvy as anywhere in the world			2
" thus , @entity41 -- @entity12 's fashion blog influenced by @entity44 and editorial spreads in magazines -- was born			1
" fashion here is fun , above all else , " he said			2
" it 's not serious or earth - shaking			2
it 's a way to get your mind off the world 's problems and focus on something beautiful			2
" below , @entity12 explains @entity10 style			1
@entity0 : what influences style in your city ? @entity62 : nestled against the @entity63 and along the @entity64 is one of the @entity67 's great outdoor playgrounds			1
opportunities for skiing , camping , hunting , bicycling and river rafting are all close by and very popular			0
this outdoor culture heavily influences clothing style , and the norm is very casual , even in downtown @entity10			1
@entity0 : describe a popular style			2
@entity62 : comfortable and casual			0
@entity0 : what different fashion statements do you see ? @entity62 : i see creative mixes of color , texture and pattern			2
unique accessories ( often vintage or thrift store finds ) are popular			0
eye - catching personal styles look better to me than the fashion magazine trends or the latest from our mainstream department stores			2
shopping here is pretty much limited to @entity92 's , @entity93 , @entity94 and other chains			0
creative fashionistas go to the thrifts and consignment shops			0
@entity0 : what do @entity10 fashionistas do with thrift store goods ? @entity62 : i see people get creative			1
they wake up in the morning and put together something fun			0
it 's more about self - expression than following any trend			0
@entity0 : what makes you stop to take someone 's photo ? @entity62 : i look for something creative in the outfit or combination of items more than just the latest from off - the - rack style			1
it 's about personality , feeling good , self - expression			0
@entity0 : do you have any favorite looks ? @entity62 : i like the mix of tailored with casual -- the latest @entity125 sport coat over worn @entity126			0
i really enjoy the resurgence of @entity128 : @entity129 , @entity130 , vintage work boots from @entity132			0
and i like shoes , real shoes : brogues , wingtips and saddle shoes , not running shoes or flip - flops			0
@entity0 : one of your collections , " @entity142 , " showcases street style in @entity10			1
what can outsiders gather from the photos ? @entity12 : " @entity142 " is a microcosm , slice of life , view of @entity10			1
it is , at least in part , a view of how we look			0
i intend for my art to be shrewd , revealing , perceptive observations of the everyday			0
how do people dress in your city ? submit your favorite looks to @entity162 for a chance to be featured on @entity0 .			0
