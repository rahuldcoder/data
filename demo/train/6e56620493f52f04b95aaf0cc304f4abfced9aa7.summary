-- @entity1 may not be the best defender of a free press , but the well - traveled former recruit of the @entity5 knows how things work abroad			1
in @entity7 , he has learnt , drawing attention to your point of view does not necessarily imply jailing or inflicting bodily harm to your dissenters but may be as simple as submitting an op - ed to the @entity14			1
that is exactly what happened on september 11 , when the renowned peacemaker of @entity18 advised @entity19 to " stop the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement " on the matter of @entity25			2
read more : @entity1 1 , @entity19 0 ? this was a sweet topic of conversation and an interesting response to @entity19 's address to the nation the night before , but the @entity34 president also criticized his counterpart for having mentioned " @entity40 " as a justification for using force or imposing its views on other sovereign countries			1
there , @entity1 may have a point			1
the @entity7 exception may be obvious to @entity7 , but it has always been a subject of conjecture for everyone else			1
simple sense of superiority ? candid idealism ? cynical expression of self - interest ? in the eyes of foreigners , the concept varied according to who in @entity7 mentioned it , when it was used , and what country , rich or poor , had to deal with it			1
adding to the complication , the @entity7 may disagree on its meaning			1
@entity61 , the conservative radio celebrity , immediately said that @entity19 had no idea what the @entity7 exceptionalism is			1
nevertheless , the president , on september 10 , used its most classical @entity67 definition , after describing the fate of gassed @entity25 children			2
he meant that @entity7 has a heart of gold , and more than any other nation , the cruise missiles to prove it			1
moral ambitions or pretentions , coupled with overwhelming force			2
a recipe for success , or , to say the least , disappointments			0
as a @entity84 child , i was raised in the epic of the gis of d - day crushing @entity88 , but soon , in 1973 , i noticed new kids had arrived in my school in a working class suburb of @entity92			2
they came from @entity94 , sometimes with only one parent because the other one had been shot dead or was being tortured in @entity97			0
their former president , i understood , was not to the liking of the @entity7 government of the times			1
as an adult , and a journalist , i could see the same post-vietnam superpower set sail to @entity107 at the request of public opinion and pack its bag at the first casualties , abandon the @entity112 ( much like every western power ) before making good on its promises against the @entity116			0
all this to say that @entity7 exceptionalism was only rarely exceptional			1
the myth even took a fatal beating in @entity121 under @entity122 , and worse , was shamed by the nonsense of @entity124 and the sordid exactions of the @entity127 prison in @entity128			0
@entity19 on september 10 had at least the courage to try to invoke the mythology			0
but the damage is done			0
an example : human rights organizations , mostly born in the @entity7 in the 1970s , focused back then their action on prodding the @entity7 government to use its power and influence to reform rogue regimes abroad			1
this is simply impossible today because of the terrible deficit of credibility of @entity142 in this matter			0
now , these organizations have to build up their power by themselves , and multiply foreign bureaus at great cost to obtain results and try to save lives			0
the reactions to @entity1 's op - ed proves that he hit a nerve in the @entity7			1
the @entity40 , understood as a sense of entitlement , superiority , uniqueness and sometimes immunity to any positive foreign influence is also shaken in the homeland			0
for long , i had been unable to discuss the tax system , the lack of universal health care , the humongous price of cable or the technology of washing machines without receiving a dreadful glare from @entity7 friends , followed by a fatalist and severe " that 's the way we do things here			1
" it is easier now			0
good news , the @entity7 way seems to follow some of the ways of the world , much as the sacred and mythical " @entity180 model " meets reality			1
@entity7 , the new free society deemed exceptional by @entity182 , was a pioneer in countless domains , like technology , education and justice , before suffocating and declining in its superb and often trivial isolation			1
its values ? the country that sent humans to the moon seems now , for the first time in decades , willing to temper ideologies to repair its bridges and roads			0
the @entity198 of medical innovation tries to tackle its dismal public health problems			0
the birthplace of juvenile justice ended up locking its kids for life without parole			0
but the @entity206 is slowly amending mandatory sentences to simply adapt to the mores of most developed societies , as the attorney general , for the first time , dares to take a look at the 2.4 million @entity7 detainees			2
a world record and a terrible @entity7 exception			2
another sign of change ? in the " newsroom , " the @entity219 series from 2012 by @entity220 , the main character , @entity220 , a disillusioned star anchorman , is asked " why is @entity7 the greatest country in the world ? " his totally nostalgic and enraged answer paints the failed , or imaginary , good old times of @entity40 : " we stood up for what was right			2
we fought for moral reasons , we passed laws , struck down laws for moral reasons			0
we waged wars on poverty , not poor people			0
we sacrificed , we cared about our neighbors , we put our money where our mouths were , and we never beat our chest			0
the first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one			0
@entity7 is not the greatest country in the world anymore			2
" but the rant was on tv			0
it made news , which is , whatever says mr. @entity1 , a very good omen for @entity7			1
the opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of @entity249 .			2

@entity1 's op - ed in the @entity14 **dispute*d* the idea of @entity7 ' exceptionalism '
@entity255 has ignored @entity1 's remarks but some @entity7 *lawmakers* were outraged
@entity249 : things are changing and many @entity7 now *dispute* notion of ' exceptionalism '
