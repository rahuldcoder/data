-- did you hear that a barge leaked 31,500 gallons of crude oil into the @entity4 over the weekend ? when the tanker collided with a tugboat , the resulting spill caused 65 miles of the river to be shut down for two days as @entity10 traffic ground to a halt and drinking water intakes were closed			1
or did you hear about the radiation leak at a @entity15 nuclear waste storage site ? the @entity16 stores plutonium - contaminated waste from @entity18 and other government nuclear sites			0
the storage site has been closed since the @entity22 leak , but just this week , officials reported that more airborne radiation has been detected in southeastern @entity15			2
both incidents come at a dangerous time , where @entity29 oil and energy companies are getting increasingly wide discretion and the @entity31 has been hollowed out , losing its authority and resources to protect public safety			1
in @entity36 and @entity15 , officials insist there is no public health threat , but such assertions are suspicious when our government at all levels is more interested in protecting the power of the military and energy industries than the public interest			2
a month after coal - processing chemicals leaked from an energy company 's storage tank into @entity52 's main water supply , officials say the water is safe to drink			2
but residents are still wary			0
@entity55 report that just showering in their water causes headaches and rashes			0
in the staunchly anti-government , @entity61 state , people wish there had been more government oversight and regulation to prevent the leak			0
which should make us all incredibly skeptical of expanding domestic dirty energy projects in the @entity29			1
for instance , the @entity69			0
forget the inflated claims about how many jobs the pipeline will create or even its environmental implications			0
just think for a second about the fact that an existing stretch of the @entity69 pipeline leaked 12 times in its first year of operation			0
@entity85 energy analyst @entity84 , commenting on the second pipeline spill in a week in 2013 involving @entity83 crude oil , wrote , " it 's crazy to think the @entity69 wo n't leak			1
" that is a terrible risk to bear for a pipeline that many experts believe will simply pump a lot of @entity83 crude oil over @entity29 soil in order to be processed and sold internationally and which will actually increase the domestic price of oil in @entity29 , according to a study by @entity98 and a report by @entity100			0
@entity69 denies that the oil will end up being exported -- despite many reports that its refined product will			2
recently a judge in @entity104 ruled that legislation there allowing the governor to approve the @entity69 route violates the state constitution â € ” a victory for opponents of the pipeline			0
days later , the @entity114 's inspector general determined that the federal government had not violated its own conflict - of - interest policies in selecting a company that stands to benefit from the @entity69 expansion as the to prepare a report analyzing the pipeline project â € ” a victory for @entity69 proponents			0
meanwhile , the ultimate decision about the @entity69 pipeline is expected to be made by president @entity125 and secretary of state @entity126 in the coming months			0
i 'm not saying we should turn off all the wells and nuclear facilities in @entity29 tomorrow			0
given our massive consumption of energy , that 's unreasonable			2
but is it too much to ask that in the wake of disaster after disaster , we restore regular levels of funding to the @entity31 so that our government can properly monitor risks to public safety and health ? already hobbled by the @entity147 administration , the @entity31 's budget has declined every year for the past four years			1
" the jurisdiction is wide here and it 's hard enough to do the job of environmental protection when working with the @entity157 and the military , even when you have a well funded agency , " said @entity148 , former @entity31 assistant administrator in the @entity149 and a dean at @entity151			1
" and this is another case , like the @entity163 plant fire ( in @entity164 last year ) and the @entity166 oil spill where industry will refuse to acknowledge that the worst case scenario can happen -- until it does , " she said			2
in addition to strengthening @entity31 oversight , we must seriously invest in green energy and new fuel technologies			1
@entity175 , this was a nonpartisan issue -- with @entity176 and @entity177 alike not only voicing concerns about climate change but also wanting our nation to get ahead in the inevitable global green energy industry			1
green energy not only reduces the risks of such devastating spills and leaks but -- an important bonus -- according to studies , green energy production actually creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production			1
and yet @entity191 is leading the globe in establishing green energy sources and manufacturing solar panels for export			1
the @entity29 appears to be lagging behind on every count -- except maybe when it comes to oil spills			1
the problem with dirty energy disasters is that we do n't hear about them unless they 're big -- on the scale of the @entity206 oil leak or the @entity207			1
the other , " smaller " stories pop up quickly , but fade from national attention			0
and yet for people along the @entity4 or in southeastern @entity15 or throughout @entity52 , the disaster does n't go away			0
and as long as we keep our heads buried in the tar sands and refuse to step up and fully regulate dirty energy industries while investing in safe , green energy , the disasters will only spread			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			2

@entity220 : many environmental disasters -- radiation leaks , oil spills -- are n't reported widely
@entity220 : it 's a bad time : @entity31 *stripped* of authority , energy *corporations* get wide *latitude*
@entity220 : it 's time to *pursue* green energy , stop fossil fuel projects , regulate dirty industries
