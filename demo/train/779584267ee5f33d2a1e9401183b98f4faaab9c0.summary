-- amid the roar of the engines , the screech of the tires and the cacophony of the crowd , they diligently and silently go about their work			2
in a sport where safety is paramount , if it was n't for them the @entity10 circus would come to an abrupt halt			1
" i do n't like the word heroes , " @entity15 , the man in charge of the marshals who will line the track at this weekend 's @entity20 @entity19 , told @entity0			1
" but when marshals give of their time freely to make motorsport successful , to make sure it 's safe for the drivers , the last thing on your mind is that you may be seriously injured -- or you may not go home			1
" the role of these volunteer men and women has been put sharply into the focus by the recent death of marshal @entity34 , who was killed after falling under a crane in the immediate aftermath of the last race in @entity38			1
marshaling is a dangerous hobby and feelings among its global community are still raw after the tragedy in @entity44			2
" for one of our own to be involved in a fatal accident is truly shocking , " explained @entity15 , who has been on duty at every @entity20 round of the @entity10 world championship since 1981			1
" any incident like that , wherever it is in the world , is something we feel personally			0
" at the first race meeting that took place at the @entity60 circuit the week after @entity38 , many of the marshals came in and wanted to do something as a mark of respect			1
" we observed a minute 's silence trackside as a sign of unity in memory of our colleague			0
we all felt it very strongly			0
" there will be close to 1200 men and women volunteer marshals at @entity60 , the legendary circuit in the heart of @entity78 that is the home of the @entity20 @entity19 and which staged the first - ever @entity10 race in 1950			1
despite the reverberations of the accident in @entity38 , @entity15 says it will be business as usual for the marshals as they ensure the world 's fastest cars and drivers race safely			1
" i do n't think there is anything procedurally we are going to change , " said @entity15			0
" we will be extra aware -- but at the end of the day what we do is dangerous			0
" racing drivers understand the consequences of what they 're doing and so do marshals			2
" there is , of course , one obvious difference between those in the cockpit and those waving flags to communicate messages to the drivers , working in the hum of the pit lane , or waiting trackside for a gap in the traffic before leaping across the barriers to remove a dangerous piece of debris from the circuit -- money			0
while @entity118 driver @entity117 is @entity10 's highest earner , reputedly commanding an annual salary of $ 31m with @entity122 's @entity121 taking home $ 26m , the marshals are unpaid for the work that they do			1
they do not even receive expenses for spending a long weekend away from home			0
instead the @entity20 race organizers give them one free guest pass , a commemorative baseball cap , free on - site camping and a voucher towards lunch			1
the marshals -- many of them fresh from their day jobs -- arrive for " work " at the @entity20 gp at 6am and are on duty for the next 13 hours			1
despite the time and expense involved -- not to mention the danger -- @entity15 argues that if marshals were paid their sense of responsibility would diminish			2
" there is no room for people who are there for the money and who do n't give a damn , " he explained			2
" when someone steps out from the barriers they are at risk and you want people who are protecting each other 's back , who understand the job and who are n't scared of the equipment			0
" people who turn up for money are not going to be the people you can trust your life with			0
" marshaling may not be for everyone but for those working in @entity20 , and at the other 18 grands prix around the world this season , the rewards would seem to outweigh the costs			2
" you get very close to the sport , that 's one of the things i love about it , " explained @entity175 , standing , unruffled by the brisk , @entity20 breeze , at the famous sweeping curves of @entity178 and @entity179 at @entity60			1
" you 're not just close to the cars , you 're involved with them and you 're making sure these drivers carry on driving safely			2
" if something happens it happens very , very quickly -- at about 160 mph			0
once you step out from behind the barriers , the adrenalin does start to pump around the body			0
" you do think ' this is a dangerous hobby			0
' it 's slightly mad ! ' " but there is a great camaraderie , we have good fun together and we 're all ' expert ' drivers of course ! " many who try a marshaling taster day and choose to go through the required training quickly find themselves in it for the long - haul			0
@entity210 has been volunteering since 1967 and when it comes to watching the generations of @entity10 drivers climb up the ranks , he has had the best seat in the house -- @entity60 's only permanent recovery vehicle			1
" all the big names have ended up in the back of the truck , " recalled @entity210			0
" the @entity221 -- @entity222 and @entity223 -- @entity224 and @entity225			0
i 've brought in grandsons of drivers who had broken down in the @entity229 ! " we meet the drivers at the worst time [ when they have crashed ] but some of them are still very personable			0
" i 've done this in a voluntary capacity for years and years and years			0
i 've hogged this seat for a very long time -- i expect some of the other marshals are waiting for me to retire			2
" when the @entity10 began , marshals came from the ranks of various racing clubs			1
they could not afford to race in grands prix and so chose to still play a part in races by acting as marshals			1
today the marshals come to race tracks around the world from all walks of life and without them giving up their free time , whatever the costs , the wheels of @entity10 simply could not keep turning			1
the @entity60 circuit in the @entity20 is always looking for new race marshals for all its race meetings			1
those interested should contact the circuit .			0

@entity10 returns at the @entity20 @entity19 on *30* june following the death of a marshal in @entity44
marshals are unpaid volunteers who give up their free time to ensure driver and crowd safety
there will be close to 1200 marshals at the @entity20 race at @entity60
