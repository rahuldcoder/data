@entity0 -- firefighters and homeowners were anxiously awaiting to learn saturday whether the emergence of cool ocean breezes and possible rain will weaken a @entity0 - area wildlfire that has burned 28,000 acres in two days and now threatens 4,000 homes			1
the weather change could be a mixed blessing , however , because a chance of isolated thunderstorms this weekend brings a risk of lightning sparking new fires , the @entity9 said			1
the @entity0 area fire , based in @entity19 , has damaged 15 residences and five commercial properties and has destroyed 25 outbuildings , fire authorities said			1
the inferno , called the @entity24 , raced about 10 miles beside upscale communities and through the @entity26 since it began thursday morning in @entity27 , @entity28			0
it reached the @entity31 shore , damaging a @entity33 shooting range next to coastal wetlands friday			0
ireporter captures bird 's - eye view of the wildfire a total of 1,895 fire personnel , six fixed - wing air tankers and 11 helicopters have battled the blaze , but as of saturday morning , the fire was only 30 % contained , an improvement over thursday 's 10 % and friday 's 20 %			1
that means 300 commercial properties and 250 outbuildings also are threatened , authorities said saturday			0
" a low pressure weather system has developed over the fire bringing higher humidity , lower temperatures , creating an opportunity to increase containment , " the state fire agency said			1
the region 's so - called @entity56 winds -- dubbed " devil winds " because they are warm and gusty out of the high desert -- have been fueling the @entity19 wildfire			1
the virtual absence of recent rain also created dry conditions ripe for the wildfires , whose season typically begins much later in the year			1
" onshore winds have begun to diminish this evening allowing for the expiration of all red flag warnings , " the @entity66 said late friday			2
the @entity56 winds gusted to 45 mph the past two days , energizing the roaring flames			0
authorities ordered a mandatory evacuation friday for the affluent @entity19 community of @entity75 , northwest of @entity0			1
evacuations remained in effect friday evening for several other areas			0
share your images federal funding was made available to cover 75 % of firefighting costs , the @entity81 announced friday			2
also on friday , the @entity19 blaze crossed the scenic @entity85 that separates the @entity26 from the sea			0
there , small fires blackened the landscape surrounding a military firing range , a @entity33 spokeswoman said			2
several timber backdrops at the range were partially or completely burned , but because the facility sits in wetlands next to a lagoon , the fires were n't a threat to @entity99 at @entity100 , said spokeswoman @entity101			2
ammunition is n't stored at the facility , she said			0
" if something catches fire , it 's in the best possible place because it 's isolated and it 's near water , " @entity101 said			2
" our biggest concern right now is smoke because it 's a very smoldering fire , and as the wind shifts , it either blows smoke toward or away from us			2
" evacuation orders were in effect in several areas on saturday , but officials lifted orders for the campus of @entity125 , @entity115 in @entity27 and for the @entity117 community in @entity118 , authorities said			0
many @entity19 residents , especially those who live in or near the mountains , were on edge about the fires and possible evacuation			2
" the sheriff said they would come pounding on the door if they came close , " said @entity19 resident @entity131			1
because of the smoke , ash and winds , people in affected areas were urged to be cautious and to avoid unnecessary outdoor activities , the @entity135 said			0
@entity1 meteorologist @entity142 described the fire as an omen for @entity28 because the wildfire season is n't supposed to start until august or september			1
mountain chaparral and shrubs are dry because @entity0 has received only half of its normal rainfall the past two years , @entity142 said			1
the vegetation is brown , instead of green from winter rain , he said			0
the @entity0 area has received less than 2 inches of rain since january , making the bone - dry region " definitely ripe for these fires , " said @entity157 , a @entity158 climatologist			1
but that could change soon			0
rain showers could hit the area sunday evening , forecasters say			0
