@entity1 -- " our foreign policy is just spinning out of control " one senator said			1
" recognize reality , " chided another			1
fourteen months after giving up his chairmanship of the @entity8 to become @entity10 's top diplomat , secretary of state @entity6 faced harsh criticism tuesday from the panel he used to lead			1
some of it was the usual partisan sniping that permeates @entity1 , especially with congressional elections looming in november			0
however , @entity16 also expressed concern about the @entity10 response to @entity20 's tactics in @entity21 , negotiations on @entity24 's nuclear ambitions and the ongoing @entity26 crisis			1
@entity6 pushed back , at times accusing senators of uninformed or short - sighted assessments , and the sometimes sharp exchanges showed a rising skepticism in @entity32 for the policies and pronouncements of the @entity36 administration as it approaches the midpoint of a second term			2
" it 's worth doing " " i may fail			0
i do n't care , " @entity6 said when @entity42 sen. @entity41 of @entity43 , a committee veteran , complained of what he predicted would be failed diplomatic efforts on @entity26 , @entity24 and @entity47 peace			1
" it 's worth doing			0
it 's worth the effort , and the @entity10 has a responsibility to lead , not always to find the pessimism and negativity that 's so easily prevalent in the world today			2
" @entity20 warns of civil war the debate on the @entity26 issue demonstrated how things have changed between @entity6 and his former committee colleagues			1
last september , the panel voted 10 - 7 in favor of a resolution authorizing president @entity36 to launch a limited military strike on @entity26 intended to deter the regime of president @entity65 from using chemical weapons			2
the measure never made it through the full @entity8 and @entity69 , in part because @entity10 ally @entity71 rejected taking part in such an operation , but the committee 's support for it showed the continuing influence of @entity6 seven months after he became secretary of state			1
on tuesday , republicans who joined @entity16 in backing the resolution last year castigated @entity6 and the administration for what they characterized as an ineffective @entity26 policy			1
" we have no policy from what i can tell , other than ... allowing people to kill each other off , and us making commitments to the opposition that we do not honor , and leaving them in refugee camps and basically stranded without the support that we committed to on the front end , " said sen. @entity83 of @entity84 , the panel 's ranking @entity42			2
@entity83 and @entity41 called for sending weapons and other military aid to some groups in the @entity26 opposition			1
so far , the administration has limited its support to humanitarian and non-lethal military aid , but @entity6 indicated tuesday it was considering increased military backing			2
support for @entity26 opposition @entity36 has rejected any chance of @entity10 troops joining the @entity26 fight , but @entity6 said the president believes arming the opposition could change the @entity26 leader 's " calculation " of how the conflict will proceed			1
when he explained how things had changed in recent months , with the opposition fracturing and jihadists joining the fray , @entity83 noted that such outcomes had been widely predicted			0
forget @entity21 , @entity26 is now the world 's biggest threat " but what was the plan to not have that happen , senator ? " @entity6 shot back			1
" i did n't notice @entity32 racing to the barriers saying , ' we 're going to , you know , we 're going to do something			0
' i do n't think the @entity10 people were going to send @entity10 troops			0
" he took particular umbrage with complaints that @entity36 failed to attack @entity26 for crossing the red line he set on using chemical weapons			0
@entity36 had decided back then to attack , @entity6 said , and the president 's resolve led to the agreement brokered by @entity20 for @entity24 to turn over its chemical weapon stockpiles to international control			1
" we came up with a better solution -- to get all of them out by working through the diplomatic channel with @entity20 , and we have an agreement which is now working out with 54 % removed " so far , @entity6 said to @entity83			0
" so , what 's your take ? would you rather drop a few bombs , send a message , and then have him still with the weapons and capacity to deliver them ? or would you rather get all of them out			0
" the @entity21 crisis also drew criticism , with @entity41 accusing the administration of using " the logic of appeasement " by failing to provide military support against @entity20 's expansionist moves			1
citing @entity157 's admonition to " talk softly and carry a big stick , " @entity41 said his former longtime colleague on the panel was " talking strongly and carrying a very small stick , in fact , a twig			0
" " here we are with @entity21 being destabilized , a part of it dismembered , and we wo n't give them defensive weapons , " @entity41 added			1
. @entity21 debate @entity6 reiterated the @entity10 threat of tougher sanctions targeting specific sectors of @entity20 's economy if @entity174 sent troops gathered near the border with @entity21 into the former @entity178 territory			1
initial sanctions imposed because of @entity20 's recent move to annex @entity181 from @entity21 already had an impact , @entity6 said , telling the panel the @entity20 ruble currency had been devalued by 7 %			1
taking umbrage at any notion that @entity36 lacked the backbone to stand up to @entity20 president @entity188 , @entity6 declared that " i do not doubt this president 's resolve one iota " while also noting that further steps against @entity20 would impact the global economy			0
" if you go down that road , it 's not just them that feels it , we 'll feel it too , " he said			0
to @entity16 sen. @entity202 of @entity203 , the committee 's chairman , a main topic was international talks with @entity24 intended to prevent @entity206 from developing a nuclear weapon			1
@entity202 worried that the goal of the negotiations had shifted from @entity24 lacking any capability to enrich uranium needed to make a nuclear weapon to now maintaining some enrichment capability			0
" it is far different from where we started off and what we were told to where i believe we are heading , " @entity202 said			0
@entity6 responded with his insistence that any final deal with @entity24 must include proof through verification that an @entity24 nuclear energy program would only be capable of peaceful use			2
the sharpest attacks came from @entity42 intent on scoring political points , such as sen. @entity227 of @entity228 , who launched a broad - based attack on the @entity36 administration			0
" you ca n't help but get the impression that our foreign policy is just spinning out of control , " @entity227 said , complaining that @entity20 continually " misbehaves " and yet the government continues trying to reach agreements with it			2
@entity41 - @entity6 clash @entity41 said failure appeared certain for three initiatives under @entity6 -- the @entity244 agreement for @entity26 talks , the ongoing talks on @entity24 's nuclear ambitions , and the @entity250 - @entity249 talks			1
prospects for @entity47 peace deal fading @entity6 has been criticized for his focus on trying to revive the @entity47 peace process , with more than a dozen trips to the region since he became secretary of state			1
the effort appeared stalled or even broken last week when @entity250 refused to carry out a planned prisoner release and announced 700 new settlement units in @entity261 while the @entity249 sought recognition from international bodies as part of a unilateral bid for statehood recognition			0
" it 's interesting that you declare it dead , but the @entity250 and the @entity249 do n't declare it dead , " @entity6 said to @entity41			2
" they want to continue to negotiate			0
" @entity41 rejected that , telling @entity6 : " it is stopped			2
" " we 'll see where the reality is as we go down the road here , " @entity6 responded			2
" there are serious problems			0
it 's a tough issue , but your friend , @entity157 , also said that the credit belongs to the people who are in the arena who are trying to get things done , and we 're trying to get something done			0
" @entity2 's @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 contributed to this report .			0
