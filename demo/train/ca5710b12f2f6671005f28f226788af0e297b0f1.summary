-- what divorce rumors ? say what you will about superstar couple @entity2 and @entity3 , but they appear determined to keep fans guessing			1
the conversation swirling around them has gone from " are they over ? " to " are they overjoyed about an addition to their family ? " as the pair wrapped up their very successful " @entity28 " tour in @entity27 over the weekend , there was speculation that @entity2 may be pregnant with their second child , a marked turn from the breakup chatter that surrounded the pair at the start of the tour in june			1
so how did the narrative switch so rapidly ? apparently with very little help from mr. and mrs. @entity32			2
much as they did with the split rumors , the couple have remained mum about a potential new baby			1
instead , fans have turned to their " @entity43 " concerts for clues , indulging in a guessing game that 's continued through the very last show			1
rumors of trouble in paradise started after the now infamous elevator incident in may			1
after @entity2 's sister , @entity49 , was shown on surveillance video fighting her rapper brother - in - law after the @entity52 in @entity53 , there were whispers that divorce was on the horizon			1
yet @entity2 and @entity3 never responded directly to the gossip about a breakup			1
instead , they released a statement following the elevator incident saying they were united as a family and announced their first joint tour with a star - studded trailer portraying them as an outlaw couple			2
incidentally , the controversy did nothing to hamper the launch of their stadium tour ; " @entity77 , " which had 16 dates in @entity75 and two in @entity27 , reportedly went on to gross more than $ 100 million			2
as the pair wound their way through their dates , every onstage interaction was picked apart for hints about their offstage relationship			2
there was the time when @entity2 changed the lyrics to her song " @entity95 , " about a faithless lover , to say " been ridin ' with you for 12 years " -- the amount of time she and her husband have been together			0
she then stepped it up another notch with a remix of her song " @entity100 , " in which she sang , " of course sometimes s * * t goes down when there 's a billion dollars on an elevator			0
" ( @entity2 and @entity3 have consistently been named among the top - earning couples in the music industry			1
) concertgoers were left to make their own decisions about what , if anything , was happening behind the scenes			0
during the show , scenes of the pair as outlaws flashed on the screen along with the words , " this is not real			2
" during their rendition of " @entity122 , " the couple shared never - before - seen video of their wedding , family time and vacations with the words , " this is real			0
" at the same time , there were reports -- like a july item in the @entity132 titled " inside the crumbling marriage of @entity3 and @entity2 " -- which claimed that the pair were now more business arrangement than happy couple			1
but apparently someone forgot to tell the @entity138 that			0
they appeared to be very much together in august when @entity2 gave an energetic 16 - minute performance at the @entity141 as her husband and daughter , @entity144 , supported her from the audience			0
@entity3 and @entity146 then took the stage to present the singer with the @entity141 @entity149 , and the family shared a tender hug on stage , causing even further head - scratching among some fans			1
and then came their last " @entity43 " show in @entity27 on september 13			0
@entity157 reports that @entity2 got emotional , wiping away tears as she said to her husband , " i love you so much " before asking the audience to " give it up for mr. @entity162 " ( which is @entity3 's legal name )			1
there has been no word from the @entity162 camp as to whether there is a blessed event on the way or not			0
that 's not unexpected , given that the couple have been notoriously private about their personal life , taking years to even acknowledge that they were a couple			0
they have been only slightly more open during their six - year marriage			0
the only sure thing is that fans will be able to see more of them on september 20			0
that 's when their @entity183 " @entity77 " concert special premieres .			0

divorce talk has now been *replaced* by baby rumors
*tabloids* report that @entity3 hinted his wife is pregnant
the pair have kept the *public* guessing
