@entity0 -- the @entity2 is , without a doubt , @entity5 's most iconic horse racing event			1
@entity6 has @entity7 , and @entity8 flock to the @entity9 , but few meetings capture the spirit of a nation quite like the " @entity2			1
" so named for the garland of roses that is draped over the winner , the @entity2 traces its rich history back to 1875 when colonel @entity17 decided to inaugurate a race in his home state of @entity0			1
@entity20 -- grandson of @entity21 of the historic 19th century @entity23 transcontinental expedition -- had been influenced by a visit to @entity6 's @entity25			0
indeed , the @entity2 was originally run over a distance of 1.5 miles -- the same distance as the @entity25 event -- before being shortened to its present 1.25 miles in 1896			1
the @entity2 is also the first leg in the venerable @entity30 , the other two legs being the @entity32 and the @entity33			1
considered one of the sternest tests in thoroughbred racing , only 11 horses have ever completed the treble , the most recent of which was affirmed back in 1978			0
jockey @entity41 's @entity2 addiction as the years stretch to decades , the search for that elusive champion capable of following in @entity45 's footsteps intensifies			1
a few have come close : in the last decade @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 have all come within one victory			0
it 's a far cry from the 1970s , arguably the races ' heyday , when the @entity30 was won three times -- by @entity45 , @entity57 and the great secretariat			2
the enormous chestnut affectionately known as " @entity60 " is probably the most famous winner of the @entity2			2
@entity58 was the first horse to win the race in under two minutes , and his record of 1:59.40 still stands today			2
he became a national celebrity , gracing the covers of @entity69 and @entity70 , following his commanding performances in all three races			0
his 31 - length victory in the @entity33 ranks as one of the finest displays of sporting perfection by any athlete -- human or non-human -- in the 20th century			0
@entity58 's dominance in 1973 eclipsed the achievements of one of the sleekest , fastest thoroughbreds ever to grace a racetrack			0
had he been born in any other year , @entity84 would have taken his rightful place among the sport 's greats			2
his sub-two - minute time in defeat to @entity58 is still the second - fastest @entity2 ever run			1
but while @entity58 has joined the ranks of the immortals , @entity84 is a mere footnote in history			0
african - americans have played an integral role in the history of the @entity2 ; indeed , the very first race was won by an @entity93 jockey ( @entity98 ) and an @entity93 trainer ( @entity99 )			1
in an era when @entity93 were still barred from participating in most mainstream sports ( it would be more than 60 years before @entity103 made his ground - breaking debut for the @entity105 ) , @entity93 - @entity93 jockeys went on to dominate the early years of the @entity2 , winning 15 of the first 28 races			1
that very first @entity2 was won by @entity107 in front of an estimated crowd of 10,000			1
nearly 140 years later , more than 100,000 people are expected to flock to @entity111 this weekend for a chance to be a part of @entity5 's oldest continuous sporting event			1
these days , @entity0 shares its @entity2 with the world			2
but it remains , in essence , very local in flavor			2
the hulking @entity111 with its famous twin spires is still imposing , but is showing its age			0
outside of the @entity2 and the @entity124 ( the fillies - only race that takes place the day before the @entity25 ) , most of the racing here is low - grade			1
@entity129 is not a rich town , unlike its well - heeled neighbor @entity132			0
if the venue feels a little frayed around the edges , that 's because racing here is not a glamorous affair			0
once a year , the international racing set descends on @entity129 , clogging the skies over the city with private jets			0
outrageously - plumed racegoers sip @entity143 from air - conditioned boxes while college students on spring break pack the infield			0
but when the renowned " fastest two minutes in sport " are up , the carnival will move on and racing will return to the people of @entity129			0
@entity0 has been the custodian of the world 's most emblematic race for more than 100 years , and will continue to preserve its unique traditions for many years to come			1
it does n't get more authentic than this .			0

@entity5 's @entity2 horse race will take place on *saturday*
known as the " @entity161 " after the garland of flowers draped over winners
it dates back to 1875 , where @entity93 - @entity93 jockey and trainer won the first race
despite its international standing , the race keeps its unique local flavor
