-- a few thousand @entity2 fans will watch their national soccer team continue its bid to end a long @entity5 wait on tuesday , but coach @entity6 says that a population of 85 million are praying for victory			1
his " @entity19 " will take on @entity9 knowing that a win will put the side five points clear of second - placed @entity13 and well on the way to reaching the final round of @entity17 qualification for @entity18 2014			1
with the domestic league halted for a year after more than 70 fans were killed during a riot at a match last february , the @entity21 's task of lifting the continent 's fallen soccer heavyweight has been fraught with problems on and off the pitch			2
@entity30 , one of the clubs at the center of the @entity34 tragedy , may have qualified for the @entity35 by winning the continent 's @entity37 title last year against all the odds , but @entity40 failed to reach the @entity41 -- a tournament it has won a record seven times			2
the country 's last @entity5 finals appearance was in 1990			1
" when i accepted this mission i knew how hard the challenge was for me , " former @entity21 team boss @entity6 told the @entity48 's official website			2
" @entity40 is a big team , a champion in a transitional period where we are rebuilding the squad			2
added to that is the current situation , and then came the @entity34 incident and football activities were suspended			0
" this made the mission even more difficult , but i never thought of abandoning it			0
all this stuff made me determined even more to achieve success with this team			0
" @entity9 has just one point from two @entity68 games , while @entity40 has six -- and @entity6 's mission was made easier when @entity13 could only draw 0 - 0 with @entity70 on sunday			1
" when we faced @entity70 in match day one of the qualifiers behind closed doors , we felt as if we were not the home team , " @entity6 said			1
" this time we 'll have a few thousands in the stands and 85 million outside praying for us to win			0
if it was possible most of these millions would be there in the stands			0
all the @entity2 want to see their national team in the @entity5 finals after a 24 - year absence			1
" after @entity9 we have two more games in june and everything could happen			0
but i believe winning on tuesday will open the door for us to win this group and qualify to the final qualifying round			0
there are no margins for error in this match			0
" @entity6 , who won over many doubters when he took an active interest in the @entity2 people 's struggles and protests following his arrival in september 2011 , believes his players can overcome their recent adversity -- especially now the domestic league has resumed			2
" those players are very strong , mentally and technically			0
playing in the @entity5 is the ultimate dream for all of them , either the young ones like @entity106 and @entity107 , or the veterans like @entity109 and @entity110 who want to put the cherry on the top of their career by playing in the @entity5			0
" defender @entity115 hopes the presence of supporters will spur his team to victory			0
" recently we played either away or behind closed doors and that affected us much			1
our supporters ' presence will be like magic and will motivate us to win this game , " he said			0
" i know only 30,000 fans can attend because of security measures , but still this is better than nothing			0
i hope to see 30,000 ones in full voice in the stands			0
" meanwhile , @entity133 edged closer to a first @entity5 finals appearance after beating @entity135 1 - 0 on sunday thanks to a late goal from substitute @entity137			1

@entity144 earned a third successive victory in @entity146 , beating second - placed @entity147 2 - 1 to move five points clear			0
