-- ashes hero @entity1 has all but given up hope of playing for @entity3 in the @entity4 in the sub-continent next month			1
despite his run - scoring feats in the recent 3 - 1 @entity9 win against @entity10 , the opener has not featured recently in the @entity3 squad for the shorter forms of cricket , including the 50 - over per side format used in the @entity4			1
@entity1 told @entity0 that he is in direct competition for an opening slot with captain @entity17 and does not rate his chances of inclusion very highly when the final 15 - man line - up is announced on wednesday			2
" @entity23 and @entity24 do quite a similar role at the top of the order , our styles are very similar			0
possibly as he 's captain he 's going to take a lot to shift , " he said			0
the 26 - year - old amassed 766 runs in the five - @entity32 , the second best ever by an @entity3 player , and clearly wants to keep up the momentum			1
injured @entity35 gets @entity4 call " it 's a little bit frustrating , especially when you 're in a little bit of form , but the selectors have been building towards this for a while now and they 're plans and unfortunately i 've not been in it , " he admitted			1
" but cricket 's a strange game , sport 's a strange game , and you never know , " he added			0
whether he gains a place for the @entity4 , or gets a call - up later during the tournament as a replacement , @entity1 's place in cricket history is assured after a hitting double century and two other centuries as @entity3 emphatically retained the @entity58			1
" to achieve that , and the manner in which we achieved it , was very special , " he said			0
" the support we 've had from everyone in @entity10 and back here has just been fantastic , " added @entity1 , who has been awarded the freedom of the @entity64 in honor of his exploits			2
yet , ironically , the @entity73 opener 's place was under threat for the tour after a sorry run of form in @entity3 's summer tests which left him low on confidence and self - belief			1
" it was very low , confidence is only bred by success			0
" that was quite a defining moment for me in my career			0
when i really , really needed a score personally and under pressure from the media and probably thinking i should n't play , to be able to deliver , i think that really helped me in @entity10			0
" @entity1 has scored 16 test hundreds and 24 other scores of 50 or above in his 65 - @entity93 career and also captained his country for the 2010 series in @entity96 as @entity17 was rested .			2

@entity1 not hopeful of winning place in @entity3 's @entity4 squad
@entity1 scored 766 runs as @entity3 beat @entity10 3 - 1 in @entity103 series
tells @entity0 that ' it 's a little bit frustrating ' to be left out of @entity3 one - day squads
@entity4 in 50 - over - per side format starts next month on sub-continent
