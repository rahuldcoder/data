@entity0 is an unremarkable place , at first glance			0
the clue is in the glamorous @entity6 woman standing out front waxing lyrical to a group of hungry looking tourists			0
the setting is a @entity13 - @entity12 restaurant in @entity14 ( @entity0 , @entity15 ; +971 4227 5559 ) , the tourists are refugees from the city 's culinary mainstream , and the woman is @entity19 -- underground food guide extraordinaire			1
@entity19 is talking about the history and variety of @entity24 cooking			2
she rat - a - tat - tats to the assembled crowd about the spartan dishes of the @entity30 bedouin and moves on to the love of vegetables in the fertile crescent through @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			2
then she pauses as waiters appear from the restaurant to satisfy the food cravings @entity19 has stirred up			1
onion and chili paste - stuffed falafel is the reward : like the restaurant it looks ordinary , but the dish is phenomenally tasty			0
the gooey , cheesy , sweet kunafa pastry served up afterward is likewise delicious			0
more : @entity48 in @entity14 : the extravagant edition food - tourism pioneer frying @entity54 , @entity19 's walking tours around a series of unheralded @entity14 restaurants , are partly an opportunity for her to share her love and knowledge of favorite @entity24 dishes , but she is also something of a pioneer for a different kind of tourism in the city			1
from a culinary point of view , @entity14 's known for its outpost restaurants for celebrity chef empires			1
they tend to be stuck in an ostentatious tower along with strange spa treatments and a rooftop pool			0
@entity19 aims to show off an older , far less extrovert part of @entity14			1
her beat is the @entity75 area on the north - eastern side of @entity77 , where her family has lived since 1989			0
breakfast stop @entity81 ( @entity82 , +971 4222 3566 ) is the second stop on the tour			0
@entity19 admits she avoided going here for a long time			2
it looked like a fast food joint -- and @entity14 has no shortage of those			1
and so it was , but not of the chain variety			0
" it does the best manousheh -- a @entity98 take on pizza , " @entity19 says ( and why not have pizza for breakfast ? )			1
it 's fired briefly in front of us in the oven , then stretched out ultra-thin so it wo n't dominate the toppings -- which include sujuk , an @entity108 sausage			2
more : six things you should n't find in the desert food market forces getting @entity113 off the ground was n't just a case of showcasing neglected , but delicious , food from everyday , working @entity14			1
it was also about fighting the corner -- make that establishing a corner -- for small , entrepreneurial tour companies among the big , mass market operators			2
" in @entity14 , you tend to have to be recognized and to throw a lot of money at something , to make it happen , " @entity19 says			1
" but that 's changing -- small ideas are beginning to take off			2
" birth of a food blog thirty - year - old @entity19 was born to an @entity6 family living in the neighboring @entity134 @entity133 , who moved to @entity14 when she was six			1
after living in the @entity135 for a while as an adult , she returned to @entity14 in 2010 to help with her father 's non-food - related business and began writing a food blog -- " i live in a @entity141			1
" she soon found her ideal subject : @entity14 's unsung culinary centers			1
she took pride in locating homely looking joints that excelled in one particular dish			0
that quest led to finds such as @entity148 ( @entity82 , +971 4295 9797 ) , a @entity30 restaurant with what resemble private indoor tents complete with @entity153 carpets , at the back			0
the key dish here is mandi -- buttery chicken designed to be eaten , thoroughly messily , with the fingers			2
apparently , the practice stems from traditional water - saving techniques : no plates equals less washing up			0
more : best @entity14 brunches : the good , the very good and the ' drunch ' a culinary conversation it took a conversation with a friend to spark the idea of using @entity19 's knowledge of the @entity14 food scene to set up walking tours			1
she thought she would only have to do a two - week tour - guiding course before she got started but she had n't reckoned on @entity14 bureaucracy -- resembling some ancient desert defensive system			1
" there are a lot of checks and balances , which is good for keeping out rogue operators , but it stifles creative ideas , " she says			0
" the system is designed for veterans , and makes it extremely hard for an outsider to try anything			0
the irony is that @entity113 -- finally launched in january 2013 -- offers precisely the more unusual sorts of experiences @entity14 tourism chiefs are trying to promote			1
@entity14 goes countercultural that 's right : @entity14 is brushing out the hair gel , washing off the fake tan , putting the gold jewelry in a back drawer and going a little countercultural			1
in a bid to hit a target of 20 million tourists a year , the city - state 's @entity200 wants to pump a lot more money into what it calls cultural and heritage tourism			1
@entity209 : things you can do in @entity14 that do n't have " seven - star " tacked in front of them			2
so , @entity19 could soon be riding a wave			2
already she 's having to turn people away to keep the small group ethos			0
when tourists hate tourists she seems to have discovered an important and potentially lucrative truth : tourists often do n't like other tourists			0
" they get wildly excited when they see a restaurant with no one like them in it , " she says			0
like at @entity229 ( @entity230 , +971 4233 0555 ) an @entity232 restaurant on the first floor of a non-descript mini-mall			0
it 's one of @entity19 's favorites -- for its freshly made eggplant dip , bread sliding out of a roaring oven on wooden paddles and its rich fesenjoon stew of chicken , pomegranate and walnut			1
@entity247 fans , get in touch			0
see @entity113 for tour dates and to book .			0

@entity19 's food tours seek out the most *authentic* dishes in @entity14
locations are sometimes *unglamorous* -- in a city *renowned* for glitz -- but recipes are delicious
@entity98 pizza , chili felafel and fesenjoon chicken stew are among tour *highlights*
@entity19 is helping to pioneer a different kind of @entity14 tourism
