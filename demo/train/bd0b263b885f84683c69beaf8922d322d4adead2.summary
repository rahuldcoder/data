-- may 10 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : environment , economy , elections , education			2
all @entity20 words , and all part of this monday edition of @entity0			2
from the @entity24 , i 'm @entity25			2
first up : oil spill @entity27 : first up , officials are moving on to plan c to try to stop the oil that 's gushing into the @entity31			1
they 've tried remote controlled subs			2
they 've tried a giant dome			2
we 're gon na have more on that in a second			0
what is plan c ? a lot of junk ! basically , you stuff the leak with trash and try to clog the thing up			0
so , what about the containment chamber , the giant dome they were planning to drop over the leak ? the thing did n't work			0
crystals formed on the dome and made it float			0
officials have n't totally given up on the idea , but they 're considering other options , including junk			0
as this oil spill starts to wash ashore , meanwhile , it could have a huge impact on several industries			1
about 40 percent of the country 's seafood harvest comes from the @entity61			1
fishermen , dock workers , restaurant owners : all of them could be affected by this , as supplies go down and prices go up			0
the biggest challenge is how to get all of this oil under control and then to get the oil out of the water			1
@entity74 shows us how the government gets ready for these kinds of situations			1
( begin video ) @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 : when trying to clean up a giant oil spill , how does the oil industry know exactly what to do , what techniques are going to work ? the research is done right here at @entity89 , the @entity90			1
this facility is run by the @entity93 's @entity92 , and it is the largest of its kind in the entire world			1
@entity97 : fire in the hole ! @entity99 : oil sprays into the water , a slick forms and expands , but it 's all intentional			1
here , the government creates controlled oil spills in a giant tank more than two football fields long			1
operators create ocean wave conditions , then they use various techniques to clean it all up			0
there are three primary plans of attack for cleaning oil spills in the water : burn the oil , apply chemical dispersants to break it down , or manually remove it			1
all three are at work in the @entity31			0
today , cleanup experts are practicing manual techniques to remove oil			1
taking oil off the surface of the water is kind of like peeling the filling off of an oreo cookie ; you 're skimming it			1
and that 's what all these various devices do			1
they skim the oil off the water			1
depending upon the grade of oil , how heavy it is , you use a different type of skimmer			1
at @entity89 , all different types of oil are sprayed into the tank from a moving bridge			1
workers can test skimmers , various dispersants , even burning , all in a safe , enclosed environment that simulates the ocean 's salinity and even its wave patterns			1
we all know oil is lighter than water			1
that 's an advantage when it comes to cleaning up a spill , because the oil sits on top of the water			1
using those booms , oil can actually be pushed into that skimmer , and then it 's sucked up using this giant vacuum			1
cleanup workers from private industry , government and 24 countries around the world have come here to practice and research such techniques , including responders trying to clean the @entity31 right now			1
( @entity173 ) unemployment numbers @entity27 : we will continue to keep you updated on that story			0
last month , the @entity180 unemployment rate went up , from 9.7 percent to 9.9 percent			1
some experts are actually saying that 's a good sign			1
what ? the unemployment rate includes people who are actively looking for a job			0
let 's say you 're out of work			1
in march , you 're so discouraged that you do n't think it 's worth it to even look for a job			1
in that situation , you 're not part of the unemployment rate			0
then in april , you think there 's a better chance of finding a job , so you start looking			1
now , you are included in the rate			0
so , according to some experts , the fact that unemployment rate went up , means that more people are feeling more optimistic about the economy			0
but the bottom line is , there are still more than 15 million @entity180 out of work			1
@entity210 @entity211 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity214 ' contemporary issues class at @entity215 in @entity216 , @entity217 ! who lives at 10 @entity219 in @entity220 ? is it : a ) @entity223 , b ) queen of the @entity4 , c ) @entity4 prime minister or @entity227 ) @entity229 @entity228 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! 10 @entity219 is the @entity4 prime minister 's home and office			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity4 election @entity27 : the question is , who is going to live at 10 @entity219 ? the @entity4 is trying to figure that out after last week 's parliamentary elections			1
none of the parties got a majority of seats			0
so now , a scramble is on			1
in the @entity4 , people vote for members of parliament			1
whichever party wins a majority of the seats in parliament gets to form the new government , and that party 's leader usually becomes prime minister			1
@entity257 has held that job since 2007			0
he heads up the @entity259			0
but they only got 29 percent of the vote in last thursday 's election			1
the @entity263 , which is led by @entity264 , got 36 percent			0
over the weekend , @entity257 and @entity264 both met with @entity265			0
he is in charge of the @entity267 , which got 23 percent of the vote			0
@entity265 could form a coalition -- basically , sort of team up -- with either the @entity259 or the @entity263 and then together , form a majority			0
@entity273 @entity27 : well , we 're staying in @entity275			0
an ash cloud from a volcano is causing problems for airplanes			0
and if that story sounds familiar , it 's because it is ! this is the same volcano and the same problem			2
it 's in southern @entity5 under a glacier ; it 's been erupting since last month			2
the problem is the ash that you are seeing right here			0
if this ash gets into a jet 's engine , it can cause the engine to fail			2
back in april , concerns about the ash shut down air travel across most of @entity275 for nearly a week			0
this weekend , several hundred more flights were canceled , and some officials closed airports in @entity300 , @entity301 and @entity302			0
word to the @entity304 @entity305 , @entity14 : a word to the @entity304 ... zero tolerance ( noun ) a policy of strictly enforcing rules and laws , without making exceptions @entity313 @entity27 : the state of @entity6 , where we are , has a zero tolerance policy about weapons in school : any kind of weapon -- gun , knife , chain -- strictly forbidden on campus			1
a 14 - year - old student named @entity326 was recently affected by this			0
he could n't find his backpack one morning			2
you 've probably experienced that yourself			0
so , @entity326 grabbed another backpack to use for the day , and he got to school before he found out that the backpack had a knife in it			0
it was a two - and - a - half inch blade that he uses when he goes fishing			0
@entity336 , arrested under zero tolerance policy : i get to school			1
i mean , it was just like a regular day			0
i went to reading and , i do n't know , one of my friends told me , " is that yours ? " and when i looked down , there was a knife on the ground and it was mine			0
@entity27 : @entity326 took the knife and turned it in himself to the principal 's office			1
but here 's where zero tolerance kicked in , and @entity326 got in serious trouble : the policy does not allow school administrators to consider the circumstances			1
so , following that policy , school officials and police treated this as a crime			2
and a teen who 'd never broken the law before was arrested and sent to a youth detention center			0
@entity326 was also expelled from the school , and he had to go to an alternative school with students who 'd committed serious crimes			2
@entity367 , @entity369 's mother : it was basically like standing outside your body watching as it was going on			2
i mean , i never imagined seeing him handcuffed and put in the back of a police car			0
@entity27 : @entity326 's mom got in touch with a state senator			2
he crafted a bill that would relax @entity6 's zero tolerance policy			1
the bill passed the state @entity385 and @entity386 ; it 's waiting for the governor 's signature			2
as far as zero tolerance policies go , a local judge says they are effective in fighting certain types of crimes , but critics argue they go too far in schools			2
@entity396 @entity27 : what do you argue about zero tolerance policies ? it 's a new week ; we have a new post up on our blog at @entity404			1
what do you think of zero tolerance policies ? if they 're effective ? are they worth it ? or do you think they go too far			2
tell us on our blog			0
the rule : first names only			0
before we go @entity27 : we 've stuffed a lot in today 's show , but hopefully you have room for just a bit more			1
but it 's worth it			2
this might be the world 's biggest burger			2
590 pounds ! a @entity427 chef concocted this creation			0
of course , he had to use a special grill , one that has a forklift inside to flip the patty			0
sure , he 's trying to break someone else 's record , but it 's to raise money for a charity			2
goodbye @entity27 : so if they were to ever meat , the old record holder might grill him for a while , but we doubt he 'll have any beef with the new guy			0
whoo ! all right , we 're having fun with this story			0
you guys have an excellent day			0
we 're looking forward to seeing you tomorrow when @entity0 returns on @entity450 , online or on @entity451			0
we 'll see you then !			0
