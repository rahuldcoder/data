-- @entity2 's president is speeding up the transfer of the @entity5 - run prison at @entity6 to @entity2 control within a month after hearing a report citing problems at the facility , including human rights issues			1
president @entity12 on thursday assigned a commission to conduct the move			0
he made the decision after a briefing about the facility and the condition of its prisoners from the head of the country 's @entity21 , @entity23			0
the commission is made up of top @entity2 officials , including the defense , justice and interior ministers			2
" the report details many cases of violations of the @entity34 and other applicable laws of the country , the relevant international conventions and human rights , " the president 's office said			1
a transfer has been planned for a while , and this effort is being made as the @entity5 pledges to hand over more authority to the @entity2 in the coming months and years			1
the original detention facility had been the @entity44 at @entity45			1
it has been replaced by a nearby prison built in late 2009 called the @entity48 in @entity49 , named for the province			1
both facilities have been called @entity6 prison			2
" the @entity5 has repeatedly made clear we are committed to working with the @entity2 government to complete a joint plan for transition of detention operations in @entity2 , " said @entity53 , a spokesman for the @entity54 in @entity55			1
" we will continue to work with the @entity2 government to meet this objective			0
" @entity53 said he believed the announcement referred to @entity49 but added that the embassy only had the palace statement to refer to and had not been given a copy of the commission 's report mentioned in the presidential news release			0
" we take seriously and investigate all allegations of detainee abuse			0
the @entity5 respects the human rights of detainees at the @entity48 in @entity49			1
any specific allegations of detainee abuse should be addressed to @entity73 , " @entity74 's @entity73			0
@entity78 spokeswoman @entity77 said the @entity5 has been working with the @entity2 government " on appropriate timing and pace for transfer of the detention facilities			1
" " we 're going to continue to work with the @entity2 government to implement the transition -- that we have both agreed needs to happen -- of detention operations in @entity2			2
we need to do this in a manner that is maximally responsible , " she said			0
@entity12 's decision also comes amid tensions between the @entity5 and @entity2 over the announcement of a @entity94 office in @entity95			1
@entity12 withdrew his ambassador from @entity95 last month , apparently unhappy that his @entity98 allies -- and principally the @entity5 -- were forging a channel for talks with the @entity94 without his approval			0
the @entity5 invaded @entity2 and ousted the @entity94 after the @entity103 terror network attacked the @entity5 on september 11 , 2001			2
the @entity94 had ruled @entity2 since 1996			0
human rights activists have criticized detention practices at the @entity6 facilities over the years			1
last year , @entity107 said the detainees " are , in fact , afforded far fewer rights than are those at @entity110 , who have the right to challenge their detention in a @entity5 court and to representation by a lawyer			2
" " some detainees at @entity6 have been imprisoned for eight years or more without charge or trial , based largely on evidence they have never seen and with no meaningful opportunity to defend themselves , " a report from the group said in may			0
a @entity127 in @entity2 fact sheet issued in october said the @entity134 in @entity49 " enables security , transparency and rule of law in @entity2 both now and when the facility is transferred to the @entity2 government			1
the design of the @entity136 allows for safe , humane and effective management of the detainee population			0
" @entity0 's @entity139 contributed to this report .			0

detention facility in @entity49 , @entity2 , was built in late 2009
the @entity5 @entity54 in @entity55 says it takes abuse allegations seriously
human rights groups have criticized abuses at @entity6 in the past
