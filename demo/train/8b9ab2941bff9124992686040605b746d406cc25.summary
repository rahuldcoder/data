-- now would be an appropriate time to cue up that @entity2 of @entity3 bawling his eyes out			0
the last few years have been a nostalgic whirlwind with @entity6 on " homeland , " @entity8 on " @entity9 , " and @entity10 on the new fx drama " the @entity12			0
" even @entity13 and @entity14 are coming back to us			0
but for fans of " @entity18 , " there 's now a glaring hole in the tv landscape			2
@entity21 has pulled @entity22 's " @entity23 " from the schedule , leaving eight episodes of the acerbic comedy unaired			1
( not to mention that @entity27 's , er , @entity32 's " fringe " just came to an end after five seasons on @entity30			2
) this just is n't how it 's supposed to work out for @entity22			1
having made a name for himself as @entity3 on the @entity39 drama , fans came to know -- and love -- @entity22 as the sensitive guy next door			1
later , a slew of guest appearances in various series , " @entity47 " sketches and the hilarious @entity48 introduced the world to a different side of the actor			0
if it 's even possible , our feelings for him grew stronger			0
so in april 2011 , when @entity22 began starring as a single , self - obsessed version of himself on " @entity23 , " it felt like the universe finally got it right			1
here 's why old and new fans , alike , ca n't bear to part with @entity22 on tv : - on " @entity23 , " @entity22 is in on the joke , poking fun at himself in the most charming way			1
he 's up for anything , be it learning a choreographed routine for his character 's turn on " @entity70 " or riding a horse sans pants as @entity73 's ( pseudo ) @entity74			0
- he even announced the sitcom 's cancellation with grace via @entity78 , followed by , " and please , no bashing @entity21			1
while i 'm sure no one there would say they think they nailed it when it came to programming # @entity86 this year ... you 've got to give @entity21 props for ever picking us up in the first place			2
they took a shot at something original & edgy			0
i respect them for it			0
" same old sensitive @entity3			0
- " @entity23 " takes advantage of @entity22 's roots , and reminds fans of how obsessed they were with " @entity18 , " which is hilarious in and of itself			1
the show toyed with the idea of organizing a " @entity106 " reunion in an october episode aptly titled " a reunion ... " @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 all guest - starred as fictional versions of themselves			2
what other show can do that ? and it 's all because of @entity22			1
- he 'll next reprise his role as @entity116 , @entity117 's loser ex-boyfriend , in an episode of @entity120 ' " @entity119			1
" he does n't consider himself to be above cameo appearances that require him to sport a bald cap and gut			0
- like a fine wine , @entity22 has only improved with age			2

@entity21 has pulled @entity22 's " @entity23 " from the schedule
on " @entity23 , " @entity22 is in on the joke , poking fun at himself
the show takes advantage of his roots , reminding fans of how obsessed they were
he 'll next reprise his role as @entity116 in an episode of " @entity119 "
