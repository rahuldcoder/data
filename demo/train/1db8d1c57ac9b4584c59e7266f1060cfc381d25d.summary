he talked a good game of acting on his own if necessary , calling for 2014 to be a " year of action , but president @entity3 's @entity5 address showed he knows that true progress depends on cooperation with a divided and recalcitrant @entity8			1
" sometimes we stumble ; we make mistakes ; we get frustrated or discouraged , " he said near the end of the more than hour - long speech , seeming to describe his bad 2013 that lowered his approval ratings			2
" but for more than 200 years , we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress			0
" it was vintage @entity3 , blending hopeful calls for a unified approach with declarations of presidential independence through executive orders			1
there were the now familiar calls to recalibrate the tax code , spend more to rebuild roads and bridges , bolster education and avoid war if at all possible			1
he brought many to tears with a tribute to @entity37 first class @entity35 , a disabled war veteran who sat next to first lady @entity39 and waved with wounded limbs to a prolonged standing ovation			1
even @entity42 relentlessly critical of the president conceded his oratorical skill			1
" a speech by @entity3 is a lot like sex , " said @entity42 strategist and @entity48 contributor @entity46			1
" the worst there ever was is still excellent			0
" according to a snap @entity48 / @entity55 poll , 44 % of respondents had a " very positive " response to @entity3 's speech , while 32 % described a " somewhat positive " response and 22 % did n't like it at all			1
last year , 53 % of respondents in a similar poll rated their response to the 2013 address as very positive			0
the underlying theme of @entity3 's fifth @entity5 address was his call on tuesday for the government to work on behalf of all @entity67 in 2014 , and his pledge to do so even if @entity8 refused to join him in an election year			1
" let 's make this a year of action , " @entity3 said			1
" that 's what most @entity67 want -- for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives , their hopes , their aspirations			0
" it 's an optimistic goal for a president with a 43 % approval rating entering his sixth year in office and facing a determined opposition in the @entity42 - led @entity85 with congressional elections looming in november			1
search the transcript of @entity3 's speech " what i offer tonight is a set of concrete , practical proposals to speed up growth , strengthen the middle class , and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class , " @entity3 said			1
" some require congressional action , and i 'm eager to work with all of you			0
but @entity99 does not stand still , and neither will i. " on issue after issue , he invited @entity8 to work with him but said he also would go it alone			0
@entity3 called for more government support to rebuild the nation 's infrastructure , but also said that " i will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects , so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible			2
" the president also promised an executive order to raise the minimum wage for some government contract workers			2
while the action is relatively narrow and affects less than half a million people , @entity3 urged @entity8 to follow suit for all low - wage workers in @entity99			2
earlier tuesday , house speaker @entity121 chafed at such unilateral action , telling reporters that @entity42 are " just not going to sit here and let the president trample all over us			1
" in the official @entity42 response , rep. @entity127 of @entity128 complained that @entity3 's policies " are making people 's lives harder			1
" " we hope the president will join us in a year of real action -- by empowering people -- not by making their lives harder with unprecedented spending , higher taxes , and fewer jobs , " she said			0
one area of possible progress is immigration reform			0
@entity3 got a long ovation when he urged @entity42 in the @entity85 to join democrats in passing a @entity147 plan that got bipartisan support			1
@entity127 also brought up the issue backed by some @entity42 as a way to bolster their weak support among @entity67 , the nation 's largest minority demographic			2
" we 're working on a step - by - step solution to immigration reform by first securing our borders and making sure @entity99 will always attract the best , brightest , and hardest working from around the world , " she said in describing the more limited @entity42 approach to the comprehensive @entity147 measure that includes a path to legal status for immigrants living illegally in the country			2
on another major reform issue , @entity3 chided @entity42 for trying to undermine his signature health care law that passed in 2010 without @entity42 support			1
he cited the millions of people helped by the reforms that ended denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions among its benefits			0
" the @entity99 people are n't interested in refighting old battles , " @entity3 said			1
" let 's not have another 40 - something votes to repeal a law that 's already helping millions of @entity67			0
... the first 40 were plenty			0
... we all owe it to the @entity99 people to say what we 're for , not just what we 're against			0
" in her response , though , @entity127 continued the @entity42 attack line on the health care reforms as big government run amok and causing harm to people by raising costs and limiting their personal choices of doctors and medical treatment			2
this year 's @entity5 is a defining test for @entity3 the @entity48 / @entity55 poll indicated 59 % of respondents thought @entity3 's policies as presented in the speech would help the economy , a lower figure than in recent years			1
@entity3 said he will order the @entity201 to create a new federal retirement savings account called @entity203 , a savings bond that would guarantee " a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in			2
" it will be available to those whose jobs do n't offer traditional retirement savings programs , he said			0
additionally , @entity3 called for : -- eliminating $ 4 billion in tax subsidies for the fossil fuel industries " that do n't need it " and instead " invest more in fuels of the future			1
" -- equal pay for women , noting they make 77 cents for each dollar a man earns , which he called " wrong " and " an embarrassment " to prompt loud and long applause			0
-- setting new fuel standards for @entity99 trucks to help reduce @entity99 oil imports " and what we pay at the pump			0
" -- reworking the corporate tax code			0
he urged @entity8 to work with him to close " wasteful , complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here " and instead " lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home			0
" -- @entity8 to lift restrictions on transferring detainees from @entity244 so the prison cna be closed in 2014			0
@entity3 also reiterated that he will veto any new sanctions bill from @entity8 that would derail talks on preventing @entity248 from developing a nuclear weapon , adding that " for the sake of our national security , we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed			2
" @entity255 : @entity3 's message : a dysfunctional @entity8 , but we 'll get it done anyway even as he cited a growing economy and increasing corporate profits , @entity3 said average wages have been flat			1
along with his order raising the minimum wage for workers on federal contracts , @entity3 asked @entity8 to get on board with a @entity267 proposal to raise the federal minimum to $ 10.10 per hour			2
republicans largely oppose any federal increase , saying it will place a burden on employers			0
" this is definitely the president 's agenda and has been for some time now , " said @entity48 chief political correspondent @entity274 , who added it was hard to see how @entity42 would respond any differently than before and therefore , it was hard to see big things happening in 2014			1
@entity280 says @entity267 should do more on poverty			0
