-- @entity1 beat @entity2 in the longest final in grand slam history to retain the @entity6 title in @entity7			1
@entity1 has now won four out of the last five grand slams , beating @entity2 in three successive finals , to underline his domination of men 's tennis , but it took him seven minutes short of six hours to see off the @entity14 in an epic final			1
after hitting the winning shot for a 5 - 7 6 - 4 6 - 2 6 - 7 7 - 5 victory , @entity1 lay on his back in triumph before ripping off his shirt , pumping his chest in triumph as he walked to the players ' box to embrace his coach			2
the match ended at 1.40 a.m. local time monday and was 59 minutes longer than the previous record , the 1988 @entity30 final between @entity31 and @entity32			2
can anyone stop champion @entity1 ? it also broke the record for the longest match at the @entity6 , the five hours 14 minutes set by @entity2 and @entity37 in 2009			1
" @entity2 , you 're one of the best players ever , " @entity1 said at the trophy presentation			1

" @entity50 told the crowd : " i will never forget this match			0
even though i lost , it was something really special for me			0
" the @entity55 was also involved in a near five - hour long battle to beat @entity58 's @entity57 in the semifinals and when he fell behind after an opening set lasting 80 minutes , all the omens pointed to a @entity2 victory			1
but the 24 - year - old from @entity64 was not to be denied even after a stirring recovery which saw his opponent take the fourth set on a tiebreak to force a decider on the @entity70 at @entity71			0
it was a bitter disappointment for @entity2 who , having beaten arch - rival @entity73 in thursday 's semifinal , was bidding for his 11th grand slam title			1
he had only lost once after winning the first set of a grand slam match since 2007 , but in the end he succumbed to @entity1 's sheer persistence			1
two breaks of service to one saw the @entity82 claim the opener , but @entity1 broke in the fourth game of the second set to recover his composure			2
however , serving to level the match , @entity1 played a sloppy game and @entity2 closed to 5 - 4			1
but @entity2 showed his first sign of fallibility in the next game as he fell behind and facing set point contrived to double fault			2
with the impetus now in his favor , @entity1 dominated the third set , running @entity2 from side to side and taking it 6 - 2 with two breaks of service			1
@entity1 forced three break points on @entity2 's service , leading 4 - 3 in the fourth , but the @entity104 showed his famous fighting qualities by retrieving them and holding for 4 - 4			1
as the game was completed , a heavy rain shower caused a break in play as the roof on the arena was closed			0
when play resumed it was @entity2 who came out the sharper and in the tiebreak which followed he upped his game to prevail seven points to five , pumping the air in trademark style as he leveled at two sets all			0
he looked set to complete the turnaround when he broke @entity1 to lead 4 - 2 in the decider			2
but it was not be be as the break was retrieved with @entity1 then looking the stronger			0
he finally broke through to serve for the match at 6 - 5			0
still he was forced to save a break point , but he closed out the match on the first championship point to claim the winner 's check for $ 2.4 million .			0
