@entity0 , @entity1 -- a little more than a year after his election , president @entity3 said his administration has laid the groundwork for success on global and domestic matters			1
" i think that we 've restored @entity13 's standing in the world , and that 's confirmed by polls , " he told @entity2 's @entity9 in a wide - ranging interview this week during his trip to @entity1			1
" i think a recent one indicated that around the world , before my election , less than half the people -- maybe less than 40 percent of the people -- thought that you could count on @entity13 to do to the right thing			2
now it 's up to 75 percent			2
" the president said that makes it easier for world leaders to cooperate with the @entity13 , noting @entity1 and @entity29 involvement in nuclear talks with @entity31			1
@entity3 has visited 20 countries during his first year in office , more than any other @entity13 president			1
a decision on troops levels in @entity38 is " very close , " the president said			1
" i will announce that decision certainly in the next several weeks			2
" @entity3 has been holding regular meetings with his war council to develop options for sending more troops to @entity38			1
last week , the president told the group -- comprising top @entity46 , @entity47 and administration officials -- that the @entity13 troop commitment to @entity38 is not open - ended and then asked for revisions to options he previously received , a senior administration official said at the time			1
the war council is considering a request by the top @entity13 commander in @entity38 for up to 40,000 more troops			1
" we have a vital interest in making sure that @entity38 is sufficiently stable , that it ca n't infect the entire region with violent extremism , " @entity3 said			1
" we also have to make sure that we 've got an effective partner in @entity38			2
and that 's something that we are examining very closely and presenting some very clear benchmarks for the @entity38 government			1
" on the @entity1 trip , @entity3 gave interviews to other networks as well , including @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			1
during the talk with @entity69 , the president said he was angry about multiple leaks over his @entity38 policy deliberations			1
he said leaking such information is a firing offense			0
" we have deliberations in the situation room for a reason , " he said			2
" we 're making life and death decisions that affect how our troops are able to operate in a theater of war			2
for people to be releasing info in the course of deliberations is not appropriate			0
" in his interview with @entity67 , @entity3 indicated concern that a growing national deficit may contribute to a loss of confidence and eventually a " double - dip " recession			2
he said he is willing to consider targeted tax cuts to help bring down rising unemployment			0
the president told @entity2 that he 's confidence efforts to overhaul health care will succeed despite missed deadlines along the way			1
senate majority leader @entity102 , @entity103 , said tuesday that he was still waiting for a cost estimate of the legislation from the nonpartisan @entity106			0
that estimate wo n't be completed until at least wednesday , a senior @entity108 source said			0
sixty votes in the 100 - member @entity111 are required to overcome a filibuster and open @entity111 debate on the bill			0
@entity108 leadership sources said a saturday vote to start debate is likely			0
it remains unclear , however , whether the @entity108 have enough votes			0
" there are just a lot of procedural hurdles that explain why health care has n't been dealt with in 40 , 50 , 70 years , " @entity3 said			1
" but i remain confident that we are going to get this done , and we 're going to have a bill that reduces our deficit , bends the cost curve , covers millions of people who do n't have health insurance right now and , for people who do have health insurance , makes their insurance more secure			0
" in a @entity135 poll released tuesday , 46 percent of respondents said they favored the version of the bill that the @entity138 recently passed , while 49 percent opposed it			0
the survey 's sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points			0
asked about running for re-election , @entity3 did n't say " yes , " but he acknowledged the long - term nature of his policy goals			2
" i do n't want to be making decisions based on getting re-elected , because i think the challenges that @entity13 faces right now are so significant , " the president said			2
" obviously , if i make those decisions and i think that i 'm moving the country on the right direction economically , in terms of our security interests , our foreign policy , i 'd like to think that those policies are continued , because they 're not going to bear fruit just in four years			0
" @entity3 said if he were concentrating on re-election , he would n't be tackling politically hot topics such as health care and education reform , development of a clean - energy economy and the closing of the @entity165 detention facility in @entity166			1
the @entity13 military is holding about 215 men at @entity165			1
among the detainees are five suspects with alleged ties to the 9/11 conspiracy , including accused mastermind @entity173			0
attorney general @entity174 said last week that @entity173 and four others will be tried in a civilian court in @entity177			0
" there are a whole series of choices that i 'm making that i know are going to create some political turbulence , " the president said			0
" but i think they 're the right thing to do			0
and , you know , history will ... bear out my theories or not			0
