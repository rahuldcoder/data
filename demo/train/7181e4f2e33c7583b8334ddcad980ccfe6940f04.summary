-- the @entity1 will not prosecute @entity2 for a 2010 raid on a @entity5 - bound aid ship that left eight @entity6 and an @entity8 dead , even though there 's reason to believe war crimes were committed , a prosecutor with the @entity14 - based court said thursday			1
while conceding that war crimes may have been committed in the botched raid , the potential cases " would not be of ' sufficient gravity ' to justify further action by the @entity1 , " prosecutor @entity15 said			1
" in the final analysis , i have , therefore , concluded that the legal requirements under the @entity22 to open an investigation have not been met and i am announcing that the preliminary examination has been closed , " @entity15 said			0
the case centers on an attempt by groups including the @entity29 - based @entity28 and a pro-palestinian @entity6 charity to deliver goods to the @entity33 territory despite an @entity2 blockade in may 2010			1
activists organized a flotilla and departed @entity29 for @entity5 , hoping to raise awareness of what it called @entity2 's " illegal siege on " the territory			1
but @entity2 commandos raided one of the ships , the @entity44 , because it violated the @entity2 - imposed blockade on the @entity33 territory			1
eight @entity6 and an @entity8 citizen of @entity6 descent were killed in the raid			0
@entity2 said at the time that its troops fired only after they were attacked with knives and other objects after boarding the ship			0
the @entity44 raid damaged relations between @entity6 and @entity2 , two close allies of the @entity8 that had previously enjoyed military , economic and intelligence - sharing ties			1
last year , @entity8 president @entity59 helped broker a telephone apology for the raid from @entity2 prime minister @entity62 to his @entity6 counterpart			2
@entity2 imposed the blockade on @entity5 in 2007 after the militant group @entity65 seized control of the @entity33 territory			2
it was designed to stop the smuggling of arms into the territory , the @entity2 government said			0
but activists say @entity2 's embargo of goods into @entity5 from land and sea punishes civilians in the tiny and densely populated strip of land along the @entity79 coast			2
@entity15 started examining the case last year at the urging of the @entity82 , an island nation off @entity85 's eastern coast			0
though the flotilla departed from @entity29 , the @entity44 was registered in the @entity82			0
@entity0 's @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 contributed to this report .			0
