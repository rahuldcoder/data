it 's an international air disaster in a war zone -- a commercial flight with almost 300 people on board shot down in eastern @entity5			1
as new details emerge , here is a look at basic questions about the tragedy : was the plane shot down ? all evidence so far says yes			1
president @entity13 declared friday that a surface - to - air missile blasted the @entity16 @entity15 on thursday over the @entity18 region of @entity5 near the @entity20 border			1
according to a senior @entity22 official , a @entity22 radar system saw a surface - to - air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before plane went down			1
a second system saw a heat signature , which would indicate a missile rising from the ground into the air at the time the airliner was hit , the official explained			2
does anyone dispute that ? not at this point			0
while the @entity5 government trades accusations of blame with @entity41 rebels it is fighting in eastern @entity5 and @entity20 itself , no one has offered evidence of an alternative theory			1
the plane 's debris field indicates a mid-air explosion			2
who did it ? a preliminary classified @entity22 intelligence analysis concludes the rebels most likely fired the missile , according to an @entity22 defense official with direct access to the latest information			1
" evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by a surface - to - air missile that was launched from an area that is controlled by @entity20 - backed separatists inside of @entity5 , " @entity13 told reporters			1
however , he stopped short of blaming any particular group			0
@entity5 officials accused the rebels , who denied it			2
now @entity5 officials have released what they say are intercepted communications in which rebels talk about downing the civilian airliner			2
@entity72 had no way of immediately verifying the authenticity of the audio recordings			0
the leader of the rebels in @entity18 said saturday he believed the flight was shot down , but @entity79 reiterated his denial that his forces did it			1
what kind of missile was used ? we do n't know for sure , but the altitude of the plane -- 32,000 feet -- means the missile must have come from a sophisticated system such as a @entity89 or @entity20 - made @entity91 missiles			1
both @entity20 and @entity5 have such systems , but @entity5 officials say none of theirs were in the rebel - controlled area where the plane went down			1
@entity20 has been arming and supplying the rebels in eastern @entity5 , and @entity22 officials said heavy weaponry , including rocket launchers , recently went across the border into the conflict area			1
can anyone fire such a missile ? no. the system requires a trained team to properly fix on a target and fire the missile that is longer than an average car			2
@entity13 noted the rebels get weapons and training from @entity20 and had previously shot down government aircraft , including a claimed strike of a fighter jet			1
" a group of separatists ca n't shoot down military transport planes , or they claim , shoot down fighter jets , without sophisticated equipment and sophisticated training , and that is coming from @entity20 , " the president said			2
did surface - to - air missile take down @entity124 17 ? should downed @entity126 jet have flown over @entity5 ? why was the plane flying over what is essentially a war zone ? the @entity16 flight left @entity131 for @entity132 and flew over eastern @entity5 , a common route for international carriers			1
most airlines follow the guidelines and rules set by their national civil aviation authorities and take the most direct route available , said @entity140 , a former inspector general of the @entity22 @entity141			0
the @entity142 and other national civil aviation authorities had yet to designate the area where the @entity126 aircraft was shot down as part of the conflict zone in @entity5 , according to @entity140			2
" they had n't defined it as a stay - away area " even though there was violence in the region , she said			0
have airlines now avoided that airspace ? yes			0
the @entity142 said @entity22 airlines had voluntarily agreed not to operate in airspace near the @entity20 - @entity5 border			2
later , it issued a notice prohibiting @entity22 flight operations in the airspace over eastern @entity5 until further notice			0
international airlines also were rerouting flights to avoid the region			2
who are the victims ? no survivors have been found from the 298 passengers and crew aboard			0
@entity16 said saturday there were 193 @entity173 citizens on the flight , the most of any nation			0
passengers came from 11 other countries including two who held dual citizenship			0
the lone @entity22 had dual @entity173 - @entity22 citizenship , according to the list			0
who will lead the investigation ? under international convention , @entity5 would as the country where the disaster occurred			2
@entity5 president @entity188 said experts from the @entity190 , an agency of the @entity191 , have joined the @entity173 , @entity124 and the @entity22 on a special commission			0
a team of 131 @entity124 investigators arrived saturday in @entity195 , but it was unclear when it would get access to the crash site , @entity124 's official news agency @entity200 reported			1
the @entity201 and the @entity202 said friday they were sending experts			0
where are the black boxes ? that is not clear			0
some reports say separatist forces found the plane 's data and cockpit voice recorders and handed them over to @entity20 , though that remains unproven			1
a @entity5 official said friday the recorders still were in the country , but he did n't know their exact location or who had them			0
on saturday , @entity79 -- the rebel leader in @entity18 -- said his group did n't have them			2
examining the recorders will be key , but @entity72 aviation analyst @entity221 said the crash location in such a volatile region made their recovery uncertain			0
" the big question will be , in whose hands will they fall , and will this be a really objective , international investigation ? " he said			0
who is in charge of the crash site ? it is in rebel - controlled territory , and the international community has yet to establish full authority over the area			1
rebels were among the first to the crash site and some of them went through the debris			1
photos show people standing on pieces of wreckage			0
" it basically looks like one of the biggest , or the biggest , crime scene in the world right now , guarded by a bunch of guys in uniform with heavy fire power , who are quite inhospitable , " said @entity248 of the @entity249 , which sent a special monitoring mission to the crash site on friday			1
" and there did n't seem to be anyone really in control , " he added			0
" for example , one of our top priorities was to find out what happened to the black boxes			0
no one was there to answer those questions			0
" a @entity5 government official said that talks were underway on creating a demilitarized zone around the crash site with a safe corridor to provide access for investigators and family members of the victims			1
the @entity280 and @entity124 's government insist on full and immediate access for investigators			0
@entity126 transport minister @entity284 said saturday the crash site 's integrity had been compromised , adding " there are indications that vital evidence has not been preserved in place			1
" why impede an investigation ? if the rebels fired a @entity20 missile , as suspected , the international backlash could be severe			1
@entity20 could face increasing international isolation and tougher sanctions , while @entity5 could get military aid from the @entity22 and @entity298			1
@entity20 president @entity299 said he urged his nation 's full cooperation with the investigation , but @entity5 officials accuse @entity20 of trying to cover up its role in what happened			1
@entity306 , the counter-intelligence chief of @entity5 's @entity307 , told reporters on saturday that three @entity89 missile systems crossed into @entity20 before thursday 's disaster , all three have now left @entity5 territory			1
@entity72 had no way to independently verify his assertion			0
how will the @entity22 and its allies respond ? @entity191 who had citizens die in the attack will demand a full investigation , as well as the normal response to any air tragedy such as return of remains and reparations for family of victims			0
countries with particular expertise , such as the @entity22 , also will participate in the investigation			0
the @entity5 unrest -- which pits the @entity22 and @entity298 - backed government in @entity195 against the rebels in eastern @entity5 backed by @entity332 -- adds further complexity			0
both @entity334 and the @entity335 have imposed sanctions on @entity20 for annexing @entity337 from @entity5 and failing to take steps to stop the conflict			2
some @entity22 conservatives , such as @entity341 sen. @entity341 , already call for tougher sanctions and arming the @entity5 military in its fight against the rebels			1
@entity13 said further sanctions would come if @entity20 continued backing the rebels and otherwise contributing to a continuation of the @entity5 conflict			1
