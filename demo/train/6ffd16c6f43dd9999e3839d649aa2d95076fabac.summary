@entity0 -- @entity0 authorities began clearing barricades at a section of a downtown protest camp on tuesday , taking action against the pro-democracy demonstrators that have occupied parts of the city for almost two months			1
the clearance followed a court order to remove obstructions outside @entity14 , a 33 - story office building close to the main protest site in @entity0 's @entity17 district			1
there were no signs of resistance from protesters , some of whom helped bailiffs , police and @entity27 representatives move the metal barricades away from the area covered by the court injunction			1
earlier , others packed up their tents to pre-empt the bailiffs			0
the court order only covers a small part of the main protest site , which sprawls over a major eight - lane highway that connects @entity38 's main financial and commercial districts			1
@entity0 's @entity39 has also issued a separate injunction to clear sections of a smaller protest site in @entity43 , a densely populated neighborhood that has witnessed some of the most violent clashes			2
earlier attempts by riot police to clear the demonstrators have not been successful , and negotiations between student leaders and government representatives did n't yield any progress			2
in their early days , the protests brought tens of thousands of people onto the city 's streets to call for full universal suffrage after @entity58 said candidates for election in 2017 would have to be screened by a committee			0
however , their numbers have since dwindled and polls show that public support for the protesters is dropping			0
the city 's government said on monday that police " would arrest anyone obstructing the bailiffs			0
" @entity0 leader @entity72 said on tuesday that the protesters were breaching the law and there was no point to resist the court order			2
@entity1 's @entity78 and @entity79 contributed to this report			0
