@entity0 , @entity1 -- those extra service fees tacked on to concert ticket prices -- long a source of grumbling by ticket buyers -- will disappear for millions of seats sold by the largest @entity9 concert promoter this summer			2
@entity10 is awaiting government approval of a merger with giant @entity13			1
@entity10 launches " no @entity20 " this week for lawn seats at amphitheaters , removing extra fees from 5 million lawn seats for shows at amphitheaters across the @entity9			1
@entity10 insisted that the promotion was about selling more tickets and helping music fans hit by hard times , not improving public relations while it waits for government approval of its merger with @entity13			1
but the promotion could soothe some bad feelings			1
" people get a little ticked off when they think they 're paying $ 20 for a ticket and as they progress along the various pages of the electronic transaction , they see more fees added a long the way , " said @entity32 , who writes about live music tours for @entity34			0
@entity10 will waive fees on lawn seats for 24 hours , beginning at midnight tuesday local time and lasting through wednesday			1
lawn seat tickets available this week include concerts by @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and many others , @entity10 said			1
other shows coming later in the summer include @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 with @entity58 and @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 & @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , @entity68 , the @entity69 , @entity64 with @entity70 , the @entity71 , the @entity72 and the @entity73			1
" they 're sacrificing quite a lot of revenue here , " @entity74 said he estimated that fees add up to about a third of the average price for lawn seats			2
the economic recession has not seemed to slow the live concert business , which " considering everything else , is going like gangbusters , " he said			0
" it looks like it could be a really strong year , " he said			0
" people want to go to shows			2
they want to hear music			0
" every tour offers some type of promotion , he said , including a lot of $ 10 lawn seats			2
" this is a business that 's pretty flexible when it needs to be , " he said			0
@entity10 began selling tickets to its own concerts only last year , just months before announcing plans to merge with @entity13 , the world 's largest ticket - seller			1
before that , @entity10 promoted shows but had no infrastructure to sell tickets , and it contracted out to @entity13 or others to sell them			1
the @entity113 merger plan has drawn criticism			0
the @entity115 launched an investigation of the proposed merger in february			0
neither @entity10 nor @entity13 executives would respond to questions about the merger			1
however , @entity13 ceo @entity121 did talk about it before a @entity123 subcommittee earlier this year			2
the merger " will give us greater flexibility in how we promote , market and sell tickets to events , " he said			0
" it will give us a pathway to alternative pricing and fee structures			0
and we will be better able to develop new and innovative products and services that enhance the fan experience and make all forms of entertainment more accessible to everyone			0
