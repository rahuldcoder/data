@entity1 , @entity0 -- scientists have discovered a new species of giant rat in a remote rainforest in @entity7			1
the newly discovered rat is similar in size and weight to this one found by scientists in 2007			1
measuring 82 centimeters ( 32.2 inches ) from nose to tail and weighing around 1.5 kilograms ( 3.3 pounds ) , the species is thought to be one of the largest rats ever to be found			1
the discovery was made by a team from the @entity19 inside the crater of @entity21 -- an extinct volcano in the @entity24 province of @entity7			1
" this is one of the world 's largest rats			0
it 's a true rat , the same kind you find in the city sewers , " said @entity28 , a biologist from the @entity29 , who was part of the expedition team			1
initial examinations of the rat -- provisionally named the @entity21 woolly rat -- suggest that it belongs to the @entity40 -- a genus of rodents in the muridae family which are the largest living species of rodent			1
in 2007 , a similar species of giant rat was found in the @entity47 in the @entity7 province of @entity49 in @entity50			1
the team of scientists which made the new discovery included experts on bats , birds , mammals and reptiles found a number of new species			1
@entity61 , a @entity62 at the @entity63 and @entity64 of @entity63 told @entity2 : " it 's hard to be sure exactly how many new species we have found , but it is more than 30			2
" to find new species of insects in this region is n't uncommon , but we found sixteen new frog species , one new bat species and at least three new fish , and this giant bloody rat -- the size of a cat			1
amazing ! " @entity61 said the inside of the crater -- which he says measures around three kilometers in diameter -- was spectacular			2
" the animals inside this crater were unafraid of humans , pretty much because they had n't seen them very much , " @entity61 said			0
most local inhabitants , @entity61 explained , tend to hunt outside the crater			0
" they do n't really go into the crater to hunt because it 's such a trek up and back down from it			0
" the newly discovered rats are n't the world 's largest rodent species			2
native to @entity96 , capybaras -- which look more like hairy pigs than rats -- weigh in at around 55 kilograms and can be up to 1.5 meters long			2
@entity61 and the team spent six weeks in the region investigating species			0
during that time it became abundantly clear to the team just how endangered these habitats are			0
" what we are trying to do , " said @entity61 , " is highlight the fact that these habitats are terribly threatened			0
in fact , only 20 miles away from where we were the wood was being extracted			0
" research published in the journal @entity112 in june 2008 estimated that over a quarter of @entity7 's forests had been either destroyed or damaged between 1972 and 2002			2
" humans ca n't seem to agree on anything , but we should at least agree that forest habitats like this one should be conserved ; not only because 80 percent of the world 's species live in forests , but if we are going to avoid the worst affects of global warming we 've got to keep these forests , " @entity61 said			0
next march , the team is traveling to @entity124 in search of more new species .			0
