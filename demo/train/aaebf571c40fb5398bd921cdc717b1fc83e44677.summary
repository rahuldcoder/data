@entity0 -- if sunday 's by - election in @entity4 is deemed to be free and fair , it will cap off a startling about - turn by the former military men currently running the country			1
for the first time ever , credible alternatives to the ruling party appeared on the ballot , including pro-democracy campaigner @entity11 , who was serving the final days of her house arrest during the general election in november 2010 , which was widely derided as a sham			1
this by - election , analysts say , will be the first real test of the government 's commitment to removing the fear and paranoia of citizens silenced by nearly five decades of military rule			1
the vote was called to fill seats vacated by the promotion of parliamentarians to the @entity28 and other posts last year			1
" it 's hugely important and it will provide a new semi-democratic political system with an opportunity to show that it has ambition to become more transparent , more inclusive and thus more democratic , " said @entity30 , a research fellow at the @entity31			2
in the weeks leading to sunday 's vote , @entity11 has traveled up and down the country , rallying support for her once - banned @entity40 ( @entity40 )			1
opening up @entity4 just the sight of her brazenly pitching her policies to huge crowds of people has emboldened many to dare to believe that democracy might be possible			2
" i 'm so happy @entity11 is free and campaigning ... she will bring a better future for this country , " said @entity48 , who went to see @entity11 in @entity49 , in the country 's south			1
but others are more wary about what the future holds			2
" i have more freedom to say what i think now , but @entity11 has to remain free and do more so we all have a better life than this , " said another prospective voter , @entity57			1
analysts say @entity11 is all but guaranteed to win her seat in @entity65 , south of @entity66 , one of 45 up for grabs in the by - election			1
" it would be a major shock if she did not win her own seat			0
but i think we have to prepare people for the expectations that the @entity40 will not win all seats in the by - election , " said @entity77 , a project director at @entity78			1
@entity80 stresses that the @entity40 does have competition , not least from the ruling @entity82 ( @entity82 ) , which was formed less than two years ago to contest the 2010 election by former general , and now president , @entity87 , and a number of other former military leaders			1
" the @entity82 has shown it is able to recruit good candidates , local figures who are popular in their own right			1
they 've got something to lose here so they 're competing , like governments everywhere , " he added			0
however , others say that it does n't matter who wins what seats in this by - election			1
after attracting international condemnation for manipulating the voting process two years ago , @entity4 's leaders know the real test of this election is proving to the world they can conduct a legitimate vote			1
" i do n't think it matters how many seats the @entity40 wins			1
i think the only thing that really matters whether it 's free or fair			0
i do n't think the people of @entity4 care about how many seats the @entity40 wins either			2
what they want to know is whether the next set of elections , the national elections ( expected in 2015 ) , are also going to be free and fair , " said @entity119 , of the @entity120			0
the staggering pace of change in @entity4 , which is also known as @entity4 , has shocked and thrilled observers			2
in the past 12 months , the country has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners , secured a ceasefire with @entity133 rebels and has agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups			0
@entity136 press rules have encouraged the proliferation of journals and magazines			0
" there 's a whole slew of information out there for voters that just was n't there in 2010 , " said @entity77			2
unlike the 2010 general election , international observers have been invited to monitor the vote			1
the @entity149 , @entity150 and members of the @entity152 are sending monitors , as are @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156			0
however , analysts say the sheer number and spread of polling booths across the country will make it impossible for international monitors to ensure an honest count			2
" we just have to take @entity87 at his word and have a look at the outcome , " said @entity119			0
" there is no way the @entity4 people would ever vote overwhelmingly for the military party and so we 'll know on the basis of who is elected whether it was free and fair			1
" so far , @entity4 's efforts to thaw its frosty relations with the rest of the world have been warmly welcomed and rewarded			0
in recent months , a steady procession of foreign ministers has visited the country and , in february , the @entity150 lifted a travel ban on @entity4 officials			0
there have been hints too that a free and fair vote on sunday will lead to the relatively swift unraveling of sanctions that have long choked the country 's economy			2
" the rapid reappraisal of sanctions is likely to come almost immediately , " said @entity30			0
" ( however ) there will be those who will consider the sanctions that are in place should only be rescinded when certain other benchmarks are met			0
there will be some , i 'm sure , who will argue that it 's terrific that @entity11 now can play an active role in @entity4 's politics , but that franchise needs to be extended to all ethnic minority groups as well			1
" as a member of parliament , @entity11 would also be expected to be free to travel outside @entity4 -- and more importantly to return -- something that was n't possible during her long years of repression and confinement			1
another potential shift is underway as well , said @entity119			0
thousands of @entity4 living in exile around the world are watching and waiting for a clear sign that it is safe to return home			0
for many , that clear sign could come with sunday 's vote			2
" the @entity4 chat rooms are full of discussion about when is it safe to go back and what will we do when we go back , " she added			0
" already we 're starting to see exiled media organizations coming back into the country and so the time is getting closer and closer for a whole generation of @entity4 people to return home			0
and that 's going to be a very exciting aspect of @entity4 's next democratic phase as well			0
