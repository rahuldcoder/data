@entity0 , @entity1 -- federal investigators trying to determine why a @entity5 jet landed on a taxiway instead of the runway in @entity8 on monday morning say the runway was illuminated , but that approach lights and a ground - based instrument that helps pilots line up with the runway were off			1
the pilots of the plane that landed at the @entity8 airport have been relieved from flying duties pending probes			1
the incident happened at @entity8 , the world 's busiest			2
but it occurred shortly before dawn , when airport operations are slow			0
@entity23 60 , from @entity24 , @entity25 , was cleared to land on a main runway around 6:05 a.m. , but it landed instead on nearby @entity27 , which runs parallel to the runway , said @entity30 spokeswoman @entity29			1
the departure taxiway , which can be filled with aircraft during peak hours , was empty at the time , and the plane landed safely , officials said			1
no one was injured , and there was no damage to the taxiway			0
the @entity41 aircraft had 182 passengers and a crew of 11			0
the @entity30 , the @entity44 and @entity5 are investigating			2
the pilots of the aircraft were placed on nonflight status , @entity5 said			0
the @entity44 on wednesday confirmed that a " check pilot " on the flight was sick , and the crew had declared a medical emergency			1
it was not clear what , if any , role that played in the mishap			0
sources familiar with the incident say that flight 60 originally was scheduled to land on @entity58 ( left ) , the active runway at that time , but was " sidestepped " to @entity60 ( right )			2
pilots commonly ask to be " sidestepped " to @entity60 -- and air traffic controllers commonly offer @entity63 -- because it is closer to the terminal and pilots can shave minutes from a trip			0
in this case , it is not clear whether the pilot made the request , or the air traffic controllers made the offer			0
nor is it clear why the change was made -- whether to shave time from the flight , or because of the medical emergency on the aircraft or some other reason			1
but after being given permission to land on @entity60 , the plane went too far to the right , landing on @entity84 the runway was marked with yellow lights , while the taxiway was marked with blue lights , one person familiar with the incident said			1
the @entity44 said the runway lights on @entity60 were illuminated , but a " localizer " and approach lights for the runway were off			1
officials said the weather at the airport was clear , and the @entity44 said the wind was calm at 10 mph			2
the sky was dark , with twilight still more than an hour away			0
the @entity44 said a " check airman " was in the cockpit with the captain and first officer during the flight , but became ill and moved to the cabin for the remainder of the flight			1
check airman are company pilots who watch over crew members during significant flights , such as when a first officer becomes a captain , when a pilot is making a maiden international flight , or over mountainous terrain for the first time			1
the @entity44 said it is uncertain why the check airman was on the @entity5 flight			1
@entity5 spokesman @entity122 said the airline is cooperating with the @entity30 and the @entity44 and conducting its own investigation			2
the pilots of the flight have been relieved from active flying , he said			0
the incident came just two weeks after the @entity30 announced that serious runway incursions were down 50 percent this year			0
close calls in 2007 at some of the busiest @entity132 airports prompted the @entity30 to take action to reduce the risk of runway incursions and wrong runway departures			0
there were 24 serious runway incursions that year , eight of them involving commercial carriers .			0
