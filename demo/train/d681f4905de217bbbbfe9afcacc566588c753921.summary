the @entity0 appears to have just scored a big win in @entity2 in taking out a key @entity4 bomb - maker plotting to blow up @entity0 passenger jets , but it could come at significant cost because the same strikes appear to have also killed fighters belonging to two powerful jihadist rebel groups who were fighting @entity11 and not previously focused on targeting the @entity0			1
@entity0 officials said the strikes overnight wednesday in @entity15 province to the west of @entity17 targeted @entity18 , a group of veteran @entity4 operatives previously based in @entity22 and @entity23			2
a @entity0 defense official told @entity27 's @entity26 one strike likely killed @entity28 , a skilled @entity30 bomb - maker in the group , while he traveled in a vehicle			1
@entity0 strike reportedly kills key bomb - maker			1
@entity36 , 24 , was one of the most active bomb - makers within the @entity18 group , a @entity0 intelligence official told @entity40 , and was working on non-metallic explosive devices which the group hoped to smuggle on board western passenger aircraft			1
among the devices @entity18 were developing to try to beat airport security : bombs made out of clothing dipped in explosive solution and explosives concealed in personal electronics and printer cartridges			0
@entity36 was also looking to recruit and train @entity52 operatives for attacks in @entity54 , according to officials			2
bomb - maker 's beginnings the @entity58 said the strikes , in the vicinity of @entity60 , hit five @entity18 targets , including vehicles , buildings , and bomb - making and training areas			1
but reports from the ground suggest that facilities and vehicles belonging to @entity70 and @entity71 were the ones hit overnight and that there were civilian casualties			0
according to the @entity76 , the strikes hit a @entity70 vehicle in @entity78 , the @entity70 headquarters in the town of @entity80 -- just 14 miles from @entity60 , another @entity82 building in @entity83 and a headquarters building belonging to @entity71 near the @entity85 border crossing with @entity87 just a few miles from @entity78			0
airstrikes target another @entity91 group this suggests @entity0 intelligence believed @entity18 operatives were being hosted by elements belonging to the two jihadist groups			1
the strikes " did not target the @entity100 as a whole , " the @entity58 stated thursday , in an apparent concession that @entity70 facilities were indeed in the firing line			0
on september 22 , @entity70 fighters were also apparently killed in cruise missiles strikes in @entity15 province that the @entity0 said were targeting @entity18			1
eyewitnesses interviewed by @entity107 said the strikes hit a @entity70 compound near the village of @entity111 , but also killed several civilians in the village			0
stirring the hornets ' nest the deaths of @entity82 and @entity71 fighters could create serious blow - back for the @entity0			1
although @entity70 is an @entity4 affiliate and has ties to -- and some overlap of personnel with -- the @entity122 , its top leadership has not to date made attacking the @entity0 and the @entity124 priority			1
the worry is that @entity70 could pivot away from its current focus on overthrowing the @entity128 regime toward plotting attacks in the @entity124			0
while @entity18 has at most dozens of operatives , @entity82 has thousands of fighters in its ranks , including hundreds of @entity52 passport holders			0
it also operates training camps on a significant scale , controls a significant and growing swath of territory in @entity2 and has deep financial pockets			2
@entity70 leader @entity141 -- in a rare public declaration -- described the @entity52 missile strikes as an assault on @entity145 , and warned the @entity52 public : " this is what will take the battle to the heart of your land , for the @entity152 will not stand as spectators watching their sons bombed and killed in their lands , while you stay safe in your lands			0
" @entity91 rivals in @entity2 find a common enemy @entity71 , a powerful and well - funded @entity159 - jihadist rebel group with widespread popularity among @entity161 , has to date kept its distance from @entity4 and shown virtually no interest in its ambitions of global jihad			2
according to @entity167 at the @entity168 , its leadership in recent months appeared to be gravitating toward more moderate positions			0
and @entity71 , like @entity170 , has been involved in fierce fighting against @entity11 over the last year			2
but @entity71 and @entity70 leaders ' anger over wednesday night 's strikes could see them soften their opposition to @entity11			1
in a @entity177 message posted thursday , @entity71 railed against the @entity0 - led coalition for " leveling to the ground " a headquarters building and called for an immediate halt to fighting between different rebel groups in @entity2			1
@entity18 likely still a threat @entity0 intelligence is still assessing the impact of the strikes on @entity18			2
several of the group 's leaders may still be alive			0
@entity0 intelligence agencies were almost certain that the head of the group -- @entity192 , a 33 - year - old @entity193 operative who was part of @entity196 's inner circle before 9/11 -- survived the september 22 cruise missile strikes			1
another senior operative in @entity18 is @entity199 , a 29 - year - old @entity200 former internet propagandist who ran @entity4 's finances in the tribal areas of @entity23 before decamping for @entity2 at some point after 2012			2
and the group has at least one other operative with bomb - making knowledge : @entity208 , a @entity200 operative in his mid- 40s who @entity0 intelligence believes has been plotting terrorist attacks against the @entity124 from @entity2 since becoming one of the founding members of the @entity122 in mid- 2013			1
@entity212 , who remains on @entity200 's most wanted list , was part of @entity4 's leadership council and its counterintelligence chief in the tribal areas of @entity23 before moving to @entity2 around 2012			2
@entity200 counterterrorism officials believe he previously received training in explosives and toxins			0
according to the @entity222 , before joining @entity18 , @entity221 and @entity208 had senior positions with @entity82 in @entity225 province , with the latter being in charge of foreign fighter networks , illustrating the overlap and ties between the two groups			0
technological race to keep @entity52 planes safe @entity0 officials believe @entity4 's affiliate in @entity236 , @entity237 , has transferred bomb - making know - how to the @entity122			1
between 2009 and 2012 , @entity237 master - bombmaker @entity239 orchestrated three terrorist plots to bring down @entity0 aviation			2
in 2009 , @entity239 fitted out a @entity243 @entity237 recruit with an explosive underwear device containing @entity245 , a white , powdery , difficult - to - detect explosive , but the attempted attack failed to bring down a passenger jet landing in @entity248 on christmas day			0
@entity249 used the same explosive compound concealed in printer cartridges in a plot to blow up cargo jets headed to the @entity0 just before the 2010 midterm elections			0
and according to @entity52 counterterrorism officials , he used @entity256 , a closely related chemical compound , in a third plot targeting @entity0 aviation with a more advanced form of the underwear device			1
the plot was thwarted by a @entity200 - @entity262 spy in 2012 who was recruited for the suicide attack and retrieved the device			0
experts tell @entity27 the latest generation of airport security scanners , including multi-view x-ray machines , and " explosive trace detection " -- which involves running a hand - held device over the surface or inside of cabin and checked luggage , " sniffing " the air for minute quantities of explosive -- have a good chance at detecting @entity245 and similar explosive compounds but offer no 100 % guarantee , especially if the explosives are well - concealed and sealed			0
western intelligence agencies believe @entity4 groups such as @entity237 and @entity18 are continuously trying to develop new ways to beat airport security			0
it is an arms race between @entity4 bomb - makers and outfits developing explosive detection technologies that could not have higher stakes .			1

official : a @entity0 airstrike in @entity2 appears to have killed @entity30 bomb - maker @entity36
@entity36 is part of the *militant* @entity122
but airstrikes likely killed other fighters not directly targeting @entity0
and that could *possibly* soften their opposition to @entity11
