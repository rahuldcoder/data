" the @entity10 - backed @entity9 @entity8 group is already viewed as a terrorist organization by the @entity12 and @entity13			1
in recent months , it has joined forces with @entity17 president @entity16 in that country 's ongoing civil war			2
@entity1 issued a statement tuesday saying the @entity3 's decision monday was " written by @entity12 hands using @entity13 ink " and that " all ( that ) was left for the @entity24 to do was to sign the document and approve the legislation			1
" @entity9 prime minister @entity29 said he hoped that the @entity3 had read data and facts about @entity1 more thoroughly before making the decision , the state - run @entity27 reported			1

@entity1 leader acknowledges fighters ' presence in @entity17 town the @entity3 move the @entity3 agreed to target just the military component , a @entity24 diplomat told @entity0			1
critics of such an approach say designating part of an entity is n't effective or practical			0
but @entity13 justice minister @entity48 's spokeswoman called the decision " correct and just , " adding that it " puts an end to the wrong argument " that @entity1 's military activities are absolved by the group 's political status			1
" even if @entity1 is a political party , that does not whitewash and make legitimate their terrorist activities , " the spokeswoman said			0
@entity12 secretary of state @entity60 said the move " will have a significant impact on @entity1 's ability to operate freely in @entity24 by enabling @entity24 law enforcement agencies to crack down on @entity1 's fundraising , logistical activity and terrorist plotting			1
" " as @entity1 has deepened its support for the brutal @entity16 regime and worked to expand its global reach through increased involvement in international criminal schemes and terrorist plots around the world , a growing number of governments are recognizing @entity1 as the dangerous and destabilizing terrorist organization that it is , " @entity60 said			2
