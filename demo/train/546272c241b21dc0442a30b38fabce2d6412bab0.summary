-- gunpowder , fireworks and attention - grabbing installations mark @entity4 as one of the world 's biggest and brightest artists			1
@entity4 's fireworks will be seen by millions during the @entity10 opening and closing ceremonies			1
the @entity13 artist is about to show the world what he can do with a spectacular pyrotechnics display at the opening of the @entity10 in @entity18			1
despite not having lived in @entity13 since 1986 , @entity4 has been selected to be the director of visual and special effects for both the opening and closing ceremonies at the @entity10			1
for the 51 - year - old contemporary artist , whose work has previously caused controversy in @entity13 , the politics that have been swirling around the @entity10 are secondary to the event itself			1
" in any country , in any city , there will be political influence on what is said , what kind of images are to be projected and , yes , of course artists can be and are influenced by politicians , " he told @entity0			2
" but what i also think is that our leaders at the very highest level want artists to be able to be free , to be creative and to show this other side of @entity13 that is vibrant			1
" while some of his art is politically charged , @entity45 has established his reputation as much as a director of the spectacular , with his work often providing a visceral and visual bang			1
he studied stage design at the @entity54 between 1981 and 1985 before moving to @entity55 a year after graduation			2
now residing in @entity57 , he gained wide - spread international recognition at the @entity59 in 1999 , winning the @entity61 prize			1
however , the work he displayed -- @entity63 , a replica of famous @entity13 socialist - realist sculpture -- upset artists of the original piece in @entity68 who believed it diminished the sentiment behind the original work			1
born in @entity73 in 1957 , @entity4 's father was also an artist , but had a much more traditional outlook than the one @entity4 developed			1
" he and his friends always lamented about the good days and , that there 's no vitality in today 's art and culture			2
so , i really rebelled against that			2
i felt that what they were talking about had very little to do with how our lives were like at that moment , " he said			0
@entity4 began using gunpowder in his work after moving to @entity55			1
detonating large trails of it on his two - dimensional pieces , creating small mushroom - clouds , or lighting enormous firework displays , explosions have been a continuous theme of his work			1
" i have always been a coward as a child			0
i am not very brave			0
i am very aware of the fact that i am not very gutsy			0
so , i am always trying to do things to kind of boost my own sense of courage a bit			0
so maybe that is why i use gunpowder , " he told @entity0			2
@entity4 has proffered different explanations for different projects that feature the same motifs			0
perhaps that is not surprising when his influences come from a myriad of sources that include @entity110 , @entity112 philosophy and ufo - observations			2
recently exhibited at @entity57 's @entity114 , " @entity115 : @entity120 " is a set of 9 cars suspended above each other with illuminated shards shooting out			0
@entity4 has previously said it denotes @entity13 craftiness in stealing western technology , while arrows piercing the life - sized stuffed tigers of " @entity115 : stage 2 " are also about the aesthetics of pain			1
" for me cars are tigers , they are all bodies of the human form and it is a human form i am working with through this medium			0
for the cars the energy goes inward out and for the tiger piece the energy flows in , " he told @entity0			0
meanings and interpretations then can be fluid , but as well as the explosions and visual excitement , there is a common social theme in his work			0
the most connected to this ethos is " @entity150 from @entity151 2004			0
" the skeleton of a wooden boat found off the coast of @entity151 , @entity55 , that spills delicate pieces of porcelain from its hull is recreated piece by piece by the people who helped excavate it			2
" this work and the history of this work belongs to the people of @entity151 and me			0
it is a shared experience , a shared history , " he said			0
" some works of art have material other works have form , but this piece has something additional , it has a narrative , it has a story that is just as important as the material and form itself			0
" ultimately the most unifying and social part of his work is the spectacle of it all			0
everyone loves fireworks , and if @entity4 's own careful planning and that of the @entity10 organizers come together , he should provide a fitting opening and finale to the world 's biggest spectacle .			1
