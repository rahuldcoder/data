@entity0 -- with only a half - dozen witnesses to go , lawyers for @entity3 have still not confirmed whether the reputed mob boss will take the stand on his own behalf			1
the delay has frustrated prosecutors who wednesday told the judge they have the right to know whether they should be working on cross-examination or closing summations			0
on day 33 of the federal racketeering trial , defense lawyers continued to raise questions about what the @entity16 did and did not do to prevent some of the murders @entity3 is accused of committing , among them the death of @entity3 crime associate @entity21			1
retired @entity16 agent @entity22 testified that 10 days before @entity21 and his friend @entity23 were murdered , he was approached by a woman described as having a " close relationship " with @entity27 " @entity26 , @entity3 's crime partner			1
defense witness criticizes @entity16 's inaction on @entity3 the woman insisted on total anonymity knowing she 'd be killed if @entity31 found out , telling the agent there were people in law enforcement on the @entity3 payroll			1
the confidential informant told @entity22 " @entity31 was going to kill @entity21 for being a snitch			0
" @entity22 gave her his word he would not put it in writing			0
however , he did speak with a supervisor who said the information should be " put on a back burner			0
" ten days later @entity21 was dead			0
the woman , believed to be @entity45 , later approached the @entity16 agent asking for help finding her daughter @entity48 who had disappeared			2
@entity48 was @entity31 's live - in girlfriend			0
during the trial , @entity31 testified he lured her to a home where @entity3 strangled her			2
defense lawyers plan to recall hit man @entity52 to testify @entity31 admitted " accidentally " strangling the stunning 26 year old			2
the defense also plans to show that @entity31 , not @entity3 , had motive to kill @entity55			1
@entity55 's mother , @entity56 , testified at a deposition that @entity31 called his common - law step - daughter a " slut , a whore , a prostitute ... doing drugs			0
" also on the stand , retired @entity16 informant - coordinator @entity63			1
he testified that when he arrived at the @entity0 field office in the late 1970s there was a lot of " paranoia " in the bureau			2
" they were nervous other agents in the office were leaking information			0
" key among the suspected leakers was @entity3 handler @entity75 who would " show up in my squad all too often , " said @entity63 who was also in charge of electronic surveillance			2
" a lot of my agents began to say he was up to no good , " said @entity63 , testifying that @entity75 had access to all the @entity16 files			1
when asked why he did n't alert his superiors , @entity63 said " i did n't have enough specific information ... so i handled it man - to - man , so to speak			0
" ' threats ' described in trial @entity63 said he was out with @entity75 and other agents one night and did n't have enough money for tolls			0
@entity75 apparently gave him $ 20 with the message , " agents in @entity0 should never want for money			1
" @entity63 also reviewed @entity3 's @entity16 informant file and found the quality of information " worthless			1
" @entity63 says he felt @entity3 should have been terminated as an informant , but did n't aggressively pursue it with his superiors or anyone at @entity16 headquarters in @entity105			1
soon after openly questioning the quality of @entity3 's information , @entity63 testified that corrupt @entity16 supervisor @entity107 , who was on the @entity3 payroll , moved the top - echelon files closer to his @entity110			1
@entity63 could not confirm whether the @entity3 file that he had in his hands was the one he reviewed more than 30 years ago saying , " this file represents a lot more than what i saw			0
" prosecutor @entity116 seemed to take offense at the suggestion it was a different file : " is it your testimony that this is not mr @entity3 's file , " he asked incredulously			1
@entity116 explained that @entity3 's file had been temporarily closed between 1978 and 1979 when @entity3 was the target of an investigation and therefore not eligible to be an informant			2
opinion : just do n't call @entity3 a rat @entity1 's @entity128 contributed to this report .			0

defense says a @entity3 *criminal* partner was the one who wanted informant dead
testimony comes after other former @entity16 agents testify about 1980s @entity0 @entity16 corruption
@entity3 faces murder , other charges in a *32* - count *indictment*
