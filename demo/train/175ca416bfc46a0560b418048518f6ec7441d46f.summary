@entity0 made a significant policy shift monday when it announced it would allow @entity3 fighters from northern @entity4 to travel through the @entity0 territory to reinforce the besieged @entity3 town of @entity7 in northern @entity8			1
the announcement was all the more striking , because earlier this month @entity0 's president equated the @entity3 militants defending @entity7 to the @entity13 fighters who were laying siege to the town			1
both the @entity3 and @entity13 militants are , in the words of president @entity18 , " terrorists			1
" " @entity0 feels like it has fallen into the subway tracks and is surrounded by live rails , " said @entity19 , senior @entity0 analyst with the @entity20 , a conflict mediation organization			2
" it is very difficult for @entity0 to make any choice			2
" @entity0 to let @entity4 @entity25 use its territory to reinforce @entity7 @entity0 's historically troubled relations with its own ethnic @entity3 population is one reason @entity30 balked at joining the @entity32 - led coalition bombing the militants who call themselves the @entity34			1
fighting triggers violence within @entity0 but @entity0 's noninterference policy came at a cost			1
the scenes of @entity3 and @entity13 fighters locked in a death struggle on the border , as well as the images of more than 100,000 desperate @entity25 fleeing to @entity0 territory , triggered spasms of deadly violence between rival factions within @entity0			1
@entity3 politicians in @entity0 accused the @entity0 government of siding with @entity13 by refusing to arm @entity7 's defenders			1
@entity25 then took to the streets in protest			0
more than 30 people were killed in cities around @entity0 this month as ethnic @entity25 clashed with @entity57 and nationalist groups as well as @entity0 police			2
violent protests over @entity13 sweep @entity0 " all of these constituencies are getting fired up by the scenes on television that they 're seeing in the @entity64 , " said @entity19 of the @entity20			1
" this has led for the first time in 20 years to gangs taking to the streets and killing each other			0
" disruption on peaceful campus on friday , the battle for @entity7 was felt at one of @entity0 's most elite institutions , @entity75			1
on a leafy campus overlooking @entity81 's @entity80 , friends , relatives and fellow academics gathered to remember a 30 - year old sociologist named @entity83			0
@entity84 , a member of @entity0 's @entity85 , was reported killed this month in @entity7 after he volunteered to join @entity3 militants defending the city			1
mourners waved red communist flags and chanted " isis killers " as they marched carrying @entity84 's portrait through the usually peaceful campus			0
@entity84 's death shocked some @entity0 , who have felt @entity0 's largest city was somehow insulated from the turmoil in the @entity64			2
" i never thought that someone from our university would actually go there and get killed , " said @entity95 , 19 , a @entity75 student			0
" i never thought i was so close to these situations because it 's so far from @entity81 , but now it 's so close			0
" one of @entity83 's professors said he understood why his former student volunteered to fight alongside the @entity25 , even though @entity84 was n't a kurd			0
" what 's going on in @entity7 today is basically kind of a struggle against barbarians ... against people who have no sense of humanity , " said @entity106 , the head of @entity75 's sociology department			2
" probably ( @entity83 ) @entity114 was very shocked			0
he basically saw this and wanted to be there in some capacity			0
" battle for @entity7 threatens peace talks an estimated 20 % of @entity0 's population is made up of ethnic @entity25			1
historically , the @entity0 government has persecuted and marginalized this community , referring to them for years as " mountain @entity0			2
" in 1984 , a group of @entity85 - inspired guerrillas calling themselves the @entity126 , or @entity126 , began fighting an insurgent war against the @entity0 state			1
the conflict would ebb and flow for the next 30 years			0
the @entity126 initially fought to carve an independent @entity130 out of @entity3 - populated regions of @entity0 , @entity4 , @entity8 and @entity132			1
but the bulk of the bloodshed took place in southeastern @entity0 , resulting in the deaths of more than 30,000 people over three decades			2
the @entity126 was accused of assassinating teachers , police officers and rival @entity3 activists			2
meanwhile , the @entity0 security forces demolished hundreds of @entity3 villages in an attempt to destroy support for the separatists			1
the @entity32 and @entity146 joined their @entity147 ally @entity0 in labeling the @entity126 a terrorist organization			1
since coming to power in @entity0 some 12 years ago , @entity18 pushed to open peace talks with the @entity126			2
meanwhile , the @entity126 has dropped its demands for an independent state , instead calling for greater autonomy and cultural and linguistic rights within @entity0			0
" this peace process is one of the only good things happening in the @entity64 today , " @entity19 said			0
but the @entity7 - related violence inside @entity0 has threatened to derail the peace process			1
@entity13 finds some support within @entity0 complicating matters further is that @entity13 has found some support within @entity0 's majority muslim society			1
hundreds of @entity0 are believed to have joined the movement			0
some appeared in propaganda videos urging their countrymen to join @entity13 ' ranks			0
" we have come here to @entity8 for jihad to practice @entity174 's religion , to practice jihad on @entity174 's path , and to gain @entity174 's sustenance to , @entity174 willing , go to his heaven , " one bearded man holding a machine gun told the camera in @entity0			1
another unnamed @entity0 militant explained in a video why he left his three children behind in @entity81 to join @entity13 in @entity8			1
" when the children are dying here , my conscience did not let me stay and love my children			0
if you come here , there is dignity , honor , everything is here , " the man said			0
" instead of staying in @entity0 and living in contempt , standing guard here for one night would be better for you			0
" @entity13 supporters have emerged on at least one @entity81 university campus			0
on september 26 , students filmed more than 10 men wearing masks and carrying clubs yelling , " @entity201 " ( " @entity174 is great " ) , in the literature department at @entity203			0
the video then showed these @entity57 students attacking leftist students who had been protesting against @entity13			0
the @entity20 's @entity19 said that when it comes to @entity13 " there 's a conflicted feeling in @entity0			1
there 's a condemnation of the methods			0
at the same time there 's a sympathy for the cause			0
" one @entity216 strongly sympathizing with @entity13 is @entity217 , a self - described " @entity218 revolutionary " and enthusiastic member of the @entity220			2
@entity217 , who spent several years in prison on terrorism convictions , now edits a magazine published in @entity81 that endorses @entity13			0
in an interview with @entity225 , @entity217 said he supported @entity13 ' violent methods , arguing they were a natural response to what he claimed were decades of @entity230 imperialism in the @entity64 as well as @entity3 and @entity232 persecution of @entity233 in @entity4			1
" we saw one man killed , " @entity217 said , referring to the multiple beheadings and executions isis militants filmed on camera and distributed over social media			0
" what about all the people killed by @entity32 airstrikes ? we have n't forgotten about @entity247 , " he added , referring to the notorious prison where @entity32 soldiers were photographed abusing @entity4 prisoners during the @entity32 occupation of @entity4			1
@entity19 advises against @entity0 being drawn further into the @entity8 civil war			1
" @entity0 has all the fractures you have in the @entity64 : the sectarian @entity233 - non - @entity233 divide , the ethnic divide between @entity25 and @entity0 , the political divide between @entity218 and @entity253 , " he warned			2
" all these fault lines can break open in a very bad way			0
" on monday , a top adviser to the @entity0 president defended @entity30 's decision not to attack @entity13			1
in an op - ed in @entity260 , deputy secretary - general of the presidency , @entity263 , argued instead that the @entity32 - led coalition should focus on overthrowing @entity8 president @entity265			1
" @entity13 's barbaric beheadings and summary executions , horrible and disgusting as they are , should not shadow the war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated by mr. @entity265 , " @entity263 wrote			0
" hitting isis while ignoring the @entity265 regime alone is a shortsighted strategy that will not end the bloodshed in @entity8 and @entity4			2

@entity0 has balked at joining the @entity32 - led coalition bombing of @entity13
battle on the @entity8 border has become a divisive issue in @entity0
in shift , @entity0 announces it will let @entity4 @entity3 fighters enter its territory to fight in @entity7 , @entity8
@entity3 - @entity13 fighting has triggered violence between factions in @entity0
