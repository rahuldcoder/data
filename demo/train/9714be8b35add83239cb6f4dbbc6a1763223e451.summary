@entity10 @entity1 was 19 , an @entity12 private , when a bomb killed him in @entity14 on november 22 , 2006			2
" from the moment those men in uniforms were at our door , each day , the pain kept getting worse , " recalled @entity1			0
" i was crawling up a wall			0
people out in the real world would tell me , ' why are n't you over this ? he 's been gone for years			0
why are n't you better by now ? ' " all i wanted to do was end my life			0
i know i 'm not alone			0
i 've talked to other parents , other family members			1
we are hurting and someone must do something			0
" if you need help , contact the @entity34 1 - 800 - 273 - 8255 , press 1 though the military tracks suicides among service members , suicides among their family members -- spouses , siblings and parents -- go uncounted			1
but @entity43 learned wednesday that the @entity45 's @entity44 has sent a report to @entity47 detailing for the first time a proposal for tracking those deaths			1
the report came partly in response to cries for help from groups like the @entity56 , whose members know firsthand about the suicides and have struggled to call attention to the problem			1
read the full report ( @entity63 ) in interviews with @entity43 , military family members who have attempted or considered suicide say the cumulative trauma of 12 years of war -- @entity70 's longest battles -- and unprecedented multiple deployments of their loved ones have left them wrung out and desperate			1
some have attempted suicide while struggling to care for injured service members			1
others , like @entity1 , have been pushed to the edge by the loss of their loved one at war			0

" this is a lonely journey that parents , siblings , spouses are walking			0
i know ; i 've talked to them			0
i do n't care how long it takes , we all want this			0
" the report , obtained by @entity43 wednesday , says the @entity45 does not currently have the ability to investigate , monitor or receive notification of military family member deaths and details how that might be done and what it would cost			1
it would take 18 to 24 months for the @entity45 to analyze data it could buy from the @entity108 's @entity107 , which tracks deaths in the general @entity70 population , the report says			1
that data -- names and locations of deaths -- could then be compared against data the @entity45 has on family members enrolled in an id card program			1
the card allows them access to health benefits and other services , like shopping at on - base commissaries			0
the cost of the effort , the report says : $ 681,600 the first year and $ 502,200 each additional year			2
the report concedes there are limitations to the plan			2
some family members , for instance , opt out of enrolling in the @entity134 program			1
service members ' parents typically would not be in the @entity134 program			2
if a relative not in the program committed suicide , it 's possible they would not be counted			2

" a couple years ago , i had people telling me i was being histrionic			0
they 'd say a bunch of military spouses were n't killing themselves			2
but we have the anecdotes			0
what we do n't have -- and i 'm glad we 're going to try to get -- is the actual data			2
" @entity151 personally knew military wives who committed suicide			1

another military spouse , @entity183 , told @entity43 that the organization she works for , the @entity56 , a nonprofit that serves a quarter - million military relatives , has heard an increasing number of stories about family members killing themselves			1
late last year , the group formally implored @entity47 to ask the @entity45 to find a way to measure the deaths			1
" we have a large network of volunteers across the country who come to us with these accounts and we have no way to track them , " @entity183 said			0
" we 're encouraged that @entity45 has come up with some kind of methodology			2

" if that number is that large just in the @entity12 , we really do n't have an idea of the scope of the problem			0
" " it 's our responsibility , " she implored			0
" these are our family members			1
we have got to find a way to track them			0
" an annual survey by @entity241 , the largest military family advocacy group , found suicide among relatives to be a serious concern			1
