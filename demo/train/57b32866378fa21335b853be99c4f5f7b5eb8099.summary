-- saying he hopes it sets an example for the nation , @entity2 gov. @entity1 on thursday signed what advocacy groups call the strongest and most comprehensive gun legislation in the nation			1
the new law bans some weapons as well as the sale or purchase of high - capacity magazines like those used in the @entity17 shooting in december that left 20 children and six adults dead			1
it also requires background checks for all gun purchases			2
" this is a profoundly emotional day , i think , for everyone in this room , " @entity23 said at the signing ceremony			0
" we have come together in a way that relatively few places in our nation have demonstrated an ability to do			0
" however , he noted , " today does not mark the end of our efforts " to combat gun violence			1
with the governor 's signature , @entity2 became the third state to pass such tough measures since the december rampage in @entity17			1
@entity42 and @entity43 passed gun - control legislation limiting magazine capacity , among other provisions			1
similar legislation appears stalled in @entity48 despite overwhelming public support for background checks and substantial -- although diminished -- support for major gun restrictions in the wake of the @entity17 killings			2
@entity2 's measure sends a message to the nation , @entity56 president @entity55 said wednesday , before lawmakers approved the final draft			1
" democrats and @entity63 were able to come to an agreement on a strong , comprehensive bill , " he added			2
" that is a message that should resound in 49 other states , and in @entity68 , and the message is we can get it done here and they should get it done in their respective states and nationally in @entity48			0
" despite disappointment in a provision in the @entity2 bill that allows people who already own high - capacity magazines to keep them , a gun control advocacy group praised the state legislation as historic			1
" it does n't have everything we wanted , but it was everything that could be done within the political reality we were facing , " @entity83 said wednesday in a statement on its website			0
critics have argued the legislation will do nothing to stop someone like @entity95 , who carried out the @entity17 school killings december 14 with an assault - style weapon and high - capacity magazines			1
" in his case , he stole the guns and went on a murderous rampage , " @entity100 , president of the @entity101 , previously has said			2
" limiting magazine capacity or mandating registration will only affect law - abiding persons , not criminals bent on murder			1
" @entity95 used weapons that were registered to his mother , who he also killed that day			0
@entity114 ' plucks the bird ' to weaken gun proposals what the bill does the @entity2 measure adds more than 100 guns to the state 's list of banned assault weapons , limits the capacity of ammunition magazines to 10 rounds and bans armor - piercing bullets			1
while the new law allows current owners of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds to keep them , it requires those people to register the magazines with the state , and forbids owners from loading them with more than 10 rounds outside their homes or while at a gun range			1
the legislation also creates the nation 's first statewide registry of people convicted of crimes involving the use or threat of dangerous weapons			2
the registry will be available only to law enforcement agencies			2
it also requires eligibility certificates for the purchase of any rifle , shotgun or ammunition , and significantly increases penalties for illegal possession and trafficking of guns			2
it also requires background checks for all firearms sales , including at gun shows , and creates safety standards for school buildings			2
debate on the legislation was emotional at times			0
sen. @entity167 spoke for five minutes , noting it was the same amount of time that the shooting lasted at @entity17			0
she recalled how parents hoping to be reunited with their children were directed to a building near the school after the shootings , but " 20 of those parents came back with a state trooper and not their child			2
" some people questioned whether the law deals enough with the state 's mental health system , a reference to the presumed mental condition of the shooter			1
the legislation allows school districts to require " mental health first aid " training for school personnel and creates a task force to examine the state 's mental health system			1
additionally , it alters state insurance regulations to beef up mental health care coverage			2
@entity17 shooting details revealed reassuring gun owners @entity63 @entity200 minority leader @entity199 , a member of the bipartisan task force that drafted the bill , reassured gun owners they would n't lose their guns or ammunition magazines , " so long as they follow our rules and register , " he said			1
" are there tighter restrictions on their use , etc. ? absolutely			0
we also were able to see as part of this legislation the repeal of early release for violent criminals			0
" families of the children slain in @entity17 were disappointed the larger - capacity magazines were grandfathered in			0
they asked had for an across - the - board ban			1
@entity23 had backed the broader ban , saying banning the future sale of high - capacity magazines " would not be an effective solution			1
" but @entity100 said the magazine limits will have no impact on crime			0
" it is ludicrous to expect people that have firearms capable of holding 15 rounds to only load 10 rounds inside of them , " he objected			0
" do criminals really care about these laws ? " @entity236 : ' shame on us ' if @entity17 does n't bring new gun legislation national fight the move in @entity2 comes as the nation is in a heated gun debate			1
president @entity236 has been waging a public pressure campaign for tougher gun laws , an effort he continued wednesday in @entity43 -- site of two of the nation 's most notorious mass shootings , in 1999 at @entity250 and last year at an @entity252 movie theater			1
" there does n't have to be a conflict between protecting our citizens and protecting our @entity258 rights , " @entity236 said			0
@entity236 is fighting intense opposition from the @entity114 , which sees restrictions as unconstitutional and ineffective			0
lawmakers in 36 states also have proposed legislation that would negate federal gun control initiatives , according to the non-profit @entity265			1
despite a spike in support for the strictest gun control initiatives in the immediate aftermath of the @entity17 shootings , a @entity0 / @entity272 poll this month found support for major restrictions may be fading			1
the poll , released march 18 , found that while a majority of @entity278 favored major restrictions shortly after the shootings , that support had fallen to 43 %			0
a survey released wednesday by @entity281 's " @entity280 " and @entity282 found that 60 % of respondents want stricter laws governing the sale of firearms			0
support for broader background checks on prospective gun owners remains overwhelming			0
the @entity281 poll showed 87 % of respondents support expanded background checks , with strong backing from @entity294 , independents and @entity63			0
a poll out wednesday from @entity297 pegged support for universal background checks at 91 %			0
that was despite 48 % of those polled conceding that such checks could form a database for later confiscation efforts			0
opinion : did we learn nothing from @entity17 ? @entity0 's @entity308 , @entity309 and @entity310 contributed to this report .			0
