-- at one time , teens @entity2 , 16 , and @entity3 , 15 , were classmates at @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6			0

a third youth , 16 - year - old @entity24 of @entity11 was also killed in the incident			1
" like many kids involved in this border reality of straddling two cultures , he had a lot of stress about what 's going on in @entity11 , " the high school principal , brother @entity26 , said of @entity2			1
the two are not related			0
the young @entity2 , the principal said , was " mischievous , but a good kid			0
" his family , which had lived in @entity11 , had recently started renting an apartment in @entity5 for safety reasons			2
@entity11 is a flashpoint in the drug cartel turf wars that have left thousands dead over the past four years			2
there were more than 3,000 killings recorded in @entity11 alone in 2010			2

seemingly everyone knows someone who has been killed , extorted , kidnapped or robbed , he said			0
