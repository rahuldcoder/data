-- oh good , the brutal cold conditions that froze much of the country last winter are unlikely to happen again			0
the @entity3 said in its seasonal outlook thursday that some of those areas east of the @entity7 might even see warmer temperatures this time			2
remember how we kept talking about the @entity10 last winter ? chances are there wo n't be as much chatter about it as we move into december and january			1
" the @entity10 is always there , " @entity0 meteorologist @entity15 reminded us			2
" when it breaks , it spills cold air into the @entity19 it 's pretty unlikely that it would happen two years in a row			1
" looks like @entity3 agrees , though it warns folks in the @entity23 and @entity24 to expect below - average temperatures -- and more precipitation			2
so cities like @entity28 and @entity29 that saw record amounts -- or near records -- of snow should n't have as much of the white stuff , but @entity34 and @entity35 may have to keep their snow plows ready , @entity15 said			0
while we probably wo n't hear as much about the @entity10 , we might see @entity38 move his way back into the weather discussion			1
@entity15 said forecasters have been waiting for an @entity38 to form in the @entity42 , but it has yet to materialize			0
@entity3 's @entity44 puts it as a 67 % likelihood of happening during the winter			0
but the @entity38 will be a weak one and bring only some rain to drought - stricken @entity49 and other states in the @entity51			1
" we 're likely to see normal amounts of rain , " @entity15 said , " which will help with the drought , but not alleviate it			0
" breakdown by region of what @entity3 expects : @entity58 --- above - average temperatures , above - average precipitation along the coast			0
@entity15 said it 's important to remember that a lot of storm systems start in the @entity23 and work their way up the coast , so cities like @entity69 and @entity70 might get more than their normal amounts of snow			1
@entity74 -- temperatures should be about normal as will the precipitation amounts in the interior parts of each state ; wetter toward the ocean @entity79 -- should be normal in temperature and precipitation in most areas @entity23 -- colder , wetter in most areas @entity51 -- above - average temperatures throughout , above - average precipitation in some southerly spots @entity87 --- drier and warmer than most years @entity88 -- warmer , normal precipitation @entity90 -- it 's always nice , it seems , but expect less rain this season			1

@entity23 will be colder and wetter but other areas will see warmer than normal temps
@entity49 's rainfall totals should be about normal , not enough to solve drought
the @entity10 likely wo n't spill as much cold air into the @entity19 for a second year
