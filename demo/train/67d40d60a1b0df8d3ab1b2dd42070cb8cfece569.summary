-- few paintings have been more viewed , more analyzed , studied and interpreted , than @entity3 's " @entity2 , " otherwise known as " @entity2			1
" despite this , no one has come up with an explanation for that enigmatic smile , or a lot of other details in this painting that , despite all the ink and hot air expended on it , measures a mere 77 by 52 centimeters ( about 30 by 21 inches )			0
in the frigid bowels of a derelict building in central @entity17 , @entity18 , that covers the ruins of an old @entity21 convent , a group of researchers is trying to nail down some of the elusive details of the woman featured in the iconic painting			1
it is here that old city records say the woman who posed for the painting , @entity28 , the second wife of wealthy @entity17 silk merchant @entity28 , was buried			1

those remains are wrapped in aluminum foil and packed into large @entity36 containers stacked in an old filing cabinet			0
@entity30 and his colleagues took them out , one by one , and eventually found one packet with what appeared to be skull fragments			0
" this is probably it , " @entity30 tells me excitedly , his eyebrows arching			0
the remains , he says , will be sent for dna testing to several universities in @entity18 and abroad , where they will be checked against the dna of two confirmed relatives of @entity28 buried elsewhere			1
i ask @entity30 : why go to all this trouble to find out if this was the woman who posed for @entity3 more than 500 years ago ? " once we identify the remains , " he says , gesticulating dramatically , " we can reconstruct the face , with a margin of error of 2 to 8 percent			1
by doing this , we will finally be able to answer the question the art historians ca n't : who was the model for @entity3 ? " i 've seen this before			2
several years ago , i did a report about the reconstruction of the face of the @entity70 ( aka @entity71 ) by @entity73 and @entity74 forensic experts using his mummified remains as a model			2
after piecing together @entity28 's skull fragments , researchers will be able to reconstruct her face , factoring in that she was probably in her early 20s when she posed for @entity3			1

for starters , he says , that famous smile is not @entity28 's			2
analysis of the " @entity2 " shows , he says , that " when @entity3 began painting the model in front of him , he did not draw that metaphysical , ironic , poignant , elusive smile , but rather he painted a person who was dark and depressed			2
" the smile , he believes , was added later , and probably belongs to @entity3 's longtime assistant ( and rumored lover ) @entity103 , whose distinct features appear in other works by @entity3			1
other art historians say the " @entity2 " is a surreptitious self - portrait			0
there is something eccentric , or slightly mad , about @entity30			0
a former producer for @entity111 , the @entity18 state broadcaster , he speaks in the language of veteran television producers the world over -- emphatic , direct and full of expletives			2
in the past , he 's produced documentaries about his attempts to solve old art mysteries and plans to do the same with his current project on the " @entity2			0
" his high - profile efforts have been criticized by academics , but @entity30 brushes them off with a dismissive snort			0
part of his motivation in this current project is a personal identification with @entity3 , who , @entity30 says , " never went to university , did n't learn @entity130 or @entity131 , and was not considered learned			0
" it will be several months before dna tests can be conducted and the reconstruction of @entity28 's face can be completed			1
and regardless of the results , @entity30 concedes that @entity3 is beyond comprehension : " this is the magic of a great genius who eludes classification , around whom remains a fog of mystery			2
i am under no illusion that we will be able to solve the mystery of the ' @entity2			0
