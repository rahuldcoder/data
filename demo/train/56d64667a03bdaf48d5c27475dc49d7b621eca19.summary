-- question : what do @entity2 , @entity3 , the @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 have in common ? answer : they are among the 500 names on the @entity11 's absurd new " enemies list			1
" @entity12 would be embarrassed to find that his once sinister form of score - keeping has been revived so promiscuously by the @entity11			2
but there is some redeeming social value here : the list illustrates an organization that has become hermetically sealed from society at large , so caught up in conservative debates that it has forgotten how to connect with @entity22			0
the enemies list was first posted on the @entity11 's website in mid-september , hiding in plain sight under the banner " @entity27			1
" but with the debate about reasonable gun restrictions reignited after the @entity32 slaughter , the @entity11 's enemies list has become just the latest example of seriously bad judgment inside this once proud organization			1
because whatever staffer was tasked with accumulating the list took the idea of " you 're either with us or against us " so literally that everyone who is n't a card - carrying conservative seems to be counted as an enemy			0
the list is divided into broad categories , including " @entity45 and @entity46 , " journalists , civic organizations and corporations -- as well as a grab bag category that includes religious leaders			1
you do n't have to be a charter member of @entity54 to see how this is going to alienate far more americans than it attracts			0
we 're living in a celebrity - driven culture , for better or worse , so let 's start with a look at the celebrity list			2
the first thing that struck me was the preponderance of ' 70s sitcom stars who are apparently among the leading threats to gun rights in @entity70 today , including @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 of " @entity77 " fame			0
it 's like the list - maker was locked in a closet full of yellowing tv guides			2
it 's a near - miracle that " @entity84 " was left off the list			2
but the @entity11 does n't seem content to limit its targets to old reruns of " the @entity87 " -- no , it has to go and bring @entity88 into the fight , along with @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			1
on the civic side , it sees fit to call out everyone from @entity99 to @entity100 to ( the late ) @entity101 to @entity102			0
you might as well declare yourself the sworn enemy of anyone who does n't subscribe to @entity106			0
this idea gets thrown into even sharper relief when you look at a partial list of civic , charitable and religious organizations that the @entity11 has determined are " anti-gun			1
" warning : take a deep breath before reading aloud : @entity113 ; @entity114 ; @entity4 ; @entity115 ; @entity116 ; @entity117 ; @entity118 ; @entity119 ; @entity120 ; @entity121 ; @entity122 ; @entity123 ; @entity124 ; @entity125 ; @entity126 ; @entity127 ; @entity128 ; @entity129 ; @entity130 ; @entity70 @entity131 ; @entity132 ; @entity133 ; @entity134 ; and the @entity135			0
i ask this in all seriousness : who 's left ? because the list includes just about every major @entity70 faith group and denomination , every major ethnic group and voter constituency			1
and adding the @entity145 and @entity146 to the list of anti-gun enemies is either clueless or callous -- or both			1
one of my favorite lyrics by @entity151 says : " choose your enemies carefully , ' cause they will define you			0
" the @entity11 , like too much of the conservative movement , has chosen its enemies indiscriminately and seems defined in opposition to most of modern @entity70			1
this is a byproduct of polarization , the cultlike expulsion of any dissenting voices and preoccupation with ideological purity			1
in the case of the @entity11 , this is reflected in its reversal on policies it supported in the past , such as gun - free school zones and universal background checks			0
but it is also reflected in tone - deaf speeches such as the ones recently delivered by @entity169 , or the truly out - of - touch television ad the @entity11 produced calling president @entity171 an " elitist hypocrite " for having the @entity173 guard his two daughters at school			2
the essence of evangelism is winning converts -- but that goal can be easily forgotten when you 're preoccupied with playing to the base			0
reasonable advocates of @entity184 rights are being ill - served by the organization 's recalcitrant radicalism -- reflected in the fact that 74 % of @entity11 members say they support universal background checks			2
adding an indiscriminate enemies list to the @entity11 website only highlights its isolation , consolidating opposition among the figures mentioned and their fans			1
as legendary columnist @entity198 -- also a @entity200 alumnus -- remarked when his name was found on the new @entity11 document , " put me first on the list			2
" this defiance is a very @entity70 response to such an awkward attempt to intimidate			0
the @entity11 enemies list will backfire badly			1
and then maybe its absurd excess will provoke a needed reset inside the organization , providing a timely reminder that the politics of addition are always more effective than the politics of division			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			0

@entity217 : @entity11 has an " enemies list " of 500 organizations , leaders , celebs
@entity217 : list is absurd , includes @entity146 , @entity94 , @entity225
list shows how *extreme* , fanatical and out of touch the @entity11 has become , he says
@entity217 : @entity11 's cultlike insistence on ideological purity puts off *people* it wants to reach
