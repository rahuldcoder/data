-- in 33 years with @entity0 , @entity1 has been almost everywhere and seen almost everything			1
that includes covering the aftermath of horrific commercial jet crashes , like @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			2
it 's what he does			1
so naturally , when he got a call on march 8 that @entity17 had vanished , @entity1 went to work			1
after that first week , though , the veteran international journalist said it became evident this was n't your typical jet crash			1
that 's all the more obvious four weeks in as investigators do n't have the plane 's wreckage in hand			1
nor do they have a fact - based explanation as to what happened			2
below , @entity1 reflects on the story and what makes it so unique and baffling -- one that might take years to unravel			1
@entity34 : what did you expect when you got the call and headed from @entity38 to @entity39 ? @entity40 : i 've covered various other air crashes that resulted in great loss of life			2
as i landed that saturday in @entity39 , i thought -- as did most journalists -- that the biggest challenge to the story would be facing grieving families , having to interview and interact with them at what was almost certainly one of the worst times of their lives			1
but i was certain the crash itself would be quickly explained , a search would quickly bring us to conclusions			2
we expected the sadness and the sorrow from the families			1
we knew because there were so many people on board and so many different nationalities , that it would be a major story			1
we expected it to be resolved in 72 hours			1
@entity34 : when did you get the sense that would n't happen ? @entity40 : very early on , at the very first news conference they hinted that the plane may have tried to reverse course , make a " turn back " as they called it			1
and i asked the head of the air force : a turn back 5 km , did it make it 10 km , 20 km ? and he said , i ca n't tell you that , i do n't know			2
and then after that , that 's when we learned that it had flown hundreds of miles on radar			1
@entity34 : what 's your take on @entity93 's response , and the reaction to it ? @entity40 : while this was not @entity93 's first air tragedy , it was an unprecedented situation where a plane had gone missing -- not because something happened that forced it down , but because it abandoned its flight course and we do n't know why			1
the officials here were really hard pressed to know what do , how to react , who was in charge			1
from the very beginning , everybody wanted to know the answer to one question : where is the plane ? what happened to my loved ones ? and why did it go off course ? these are fundamental questions that would be asked by anyone			1
the problem was that @entity93 authorities did n't have any idea what the answer was to these questions			2
how could they ? but that was seen by many as they must be covering something up , they must be hiding something			2
it did n't help that the aircraft flew back across the @entity135 undetected , they did n't scramble any jets and it simply flew away into the @entity138			0
and it appeared at the time that their civil aviation and that their military aviation were n't talking to one another or had n't communicated with one another			0
so the combination of multiple voices with no answers undermined any trust that the families had			0
the @entity149 , especially , were bitter			0
internet chat rooms and news outlets pumped up the theories			0
they included accusations that the @entity93 may have shot down the plane and they are covering it all up , that there was a hijacking and the @entity93 government was negotiating with them and they were n't telling the families			1
@entity149 's government allowed protests in @entity163 against @entity93 's embassy			1
the kind of protests @entity149 would never tolerate if its own government were the target			0
( they fueled the idea ) that somehow the @entity93 government was directly responsible for the fate of their relatives and was trying to deceive them			0
@entity34 : what 's at stake for @entity93 ? @entity40 : they knew they were overwhelmed , confused and sending mixed signals in the first week			1
they tried to do their best , but it was an unprecedented situation			0
rivalries within the government may have contributed			0
clearly there was some level of incompetence			0
people forget that the @entity187 on 9/11 did n't realize that those planes were going into the @entity189 until the second one hit and the @entity191 had been hit			0
and that 's when ( the @entity187 ) scrambled jets			1
so here 's tiny @entity93 -- with no experience in any of this -- and they know that they screwed up , but they desperately wanted to show they could get it right			1
that 's why they brought in a pr firm and reorganized themselves to help get a single message out and to try to dispel the rumors that they were trying to cover something up			1
it 's a national airline			1
their logic has been : if we find the plane and unravel what happened here , people will overlook the first few days of confusion and know we were never hiding something			1
they did n't have any of the capabilities or any of the assets to find this plane			1
so they organized a huge effort for the region			0
they also wanted this opportunity to shine			0
but again , they knew that they had to find the plane to make the whole thing work			2
so that 's why they 're so dedicated ... they will happily spend the last dollar that @entity236 has to find this plane			1
@entity34 : why has this story resonated with so many people ? @entity40 : this story has captured the world 's attention because no one can believe that a sophisticated airliner like the @entity244 with 239 people on board can simply vanish into thin air			1
with no answers coming out of @entity39 , the internet went wild with speculation			0
movie scripts started appearing online , there were attempts to crowdsource the search for the plane by looking at satellite photos			2
all kinds of images would pop up that you could n't trace			0
because there were no facts , you could make them up			0
@entity34 : how do you approach a story like this ? @entity40 : i 've never covered a story like this one that had so few facts and so much speculation in so many different directions			2
very quickly we saw chaos			0
yes , the government was responsible for some of it			0
but @entity93 and the media danced down the road of contradiction and confusion together			0
reporters misinterpreted what they were told			0
sources misinterpreted what they were telling reporters			0
when i began to see it unfolding , i was more determined than ever to avoid speculation and conjecture about what happened to the plane			2
from what our sources were telling us , it was obvious they did n't have any real facts and there was no point in pretending we did , either			0
i was n't going to embrace some theory			0
once @entity0 broke the story this plane had flown out of the @entity303 , back across the @entity135 , i understood this was a bizarre , unprecedented event			1
the outcome was unpredictable because almost anything was possible			0
and so i kept convincing myself that evidence has to be coming			0
it has to be seen on a satellite , it has to be seen on a radar			0
( and conspiracy theorists speculating about terrorism ) never stopped themselves to ask the basic question of : who did it ? tell me who on board did it ? they could n't do that			0
some of these rumors persist			0
some of them start in @entity149 , some of them have started with aviation buffs			0
but none of the theories have any evidence to back it up			0
it is such a mystery because we have so few facts			2
@entity34 : what makes this story stand out for you , of all those big ones you 've covered ? @entity40 : i 'm trying to think of a story that 's more baffling			1
with @entity8 , @entity7 , they had the airplane			0
it was a mystery at first because they did n't know why it came down			2
but we knew we had the evidence there and we would be able to find out what caused it			0
this case is far more baffling because we have a plane that reversed its flight path , traveled almost in a line to @entity353 and apparently stayed aloft until it ran out of fuel			1
that 's a plot ? there 's been no claim of responsibility			2
there 's been no manifesto explaining any political motives or personal motives for anyone			2
how does a plane with a catastrophic mechanical malfunction go on to fly another seven hours ? and as we try to imagine what was going on aboard the aircraft this entire time , would the other crew members have just stood by and let the plane go off in the opposite direction ? there 's a very good reason for our curiosity			1
there 's a very good reason for us to want to extend the resource necessary to unravel this mystery .			1

@entity0 anchor @entity1 is a veteran international journalist
he says it 's hard to " think of a story that 's more baffling " than the plane 's *disappearance*
@entity1 expected it would be resolved in 72 hours
four weeks later , the plane 's vanishing remains a mystery
