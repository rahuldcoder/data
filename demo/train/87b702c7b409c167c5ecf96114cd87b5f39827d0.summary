-- while the @entity5 mobile operating system is free , the smartphones and tablets that use it have generally been rather pricey and thus out of reach for many consumers			1
but now , @entity5 is getting more accessible to typical consumers -- both in terms of usability and ( more importantly ) price			2
at last week 's @entity14 mobile technology conference and expo in @entity16 , @entity17 , several vendors introduced simpler , less costly cell phones that run @entity5 -- all under $ 150 ( after rebate ) , and some as cheap as $ 50			1
some carriers have already revealed prices for data plans for these phones , at a cost significantly less than what smartphone users typically pay per month			1
the phones do n't necessarily offer the same speed and performance as higher - end smartphones			1
but this is where the line between feature phones and smartphones is blurring			2
for example : @entity37 @entity38 and @entity39 are launching versions of this phone , which is basically a low - cost starter smartphone			0
it has a 3.2 - inch capacitive touch screen ( one that responds to human fingers ) , a 3.2 - megapixel camera ( with video capture ) , microsd expandable storage ( a 2 gb card comes standard , but the phone supports cards up to 32 gb ) , and the latest version of @entity5 ( 2.2 " @entity52 " )			1
@entity38 plans to offer the @entity37 starting october 31 for $ 49.99 -- after a $ 100 mail - in rebate and with a two - year contract that could cost about $ 60 a month			1
that 's not quite as affordable as the flat $ 40 - a - month " for everything " offer from discount carrier @entity57 , but it 's a lot less expensive than a @entity61 or an @entity62			1
@entity39 has not yet given a price for its @entity37 phone but expects to release it for the holiday season			0
@entity65 this slider - style device has a full qwerty keyboard , a form factor that appeals to many feature phone and @entity71 users but also is reminiscent of the @entity73 smartphone			0
it has a 480 x 320 - pixel touch screen display , front - and back - facing cameras for video chat , up to 32 gb of @entity79 storage and @entity81 / bluetooth capability			0
it 's running @entity5 2.1 -- not the latest version -- but will support most @entity5 apps , widgets and services			2
according to @entity87 , @entity38 began selling the transform on october 10 for $ 149.99 , after a $ 100 mail - in rebate and with a new two - year service agreement			2
@entity91 this phone ( which actually is manufactured by @entity93 ) will be offered by @entity94 for $ 99.99 , with a new two - year service agreement and after a $ 100 mail - in rebate			2
it features a 3.5 - inch wvga touch screen , 3.2 - megapixel camera and 30 - frame - per - second video			2
@entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 this trio of midrange @entity5 phones is coming from @entity106			1
the @entity101 is due out october 17 , and the other two around the holidays			0
the @entity101 has a pivoting qwerty keyboard and will cost only about $ 80			0
the @entity102 costs about $ 100 and has a slide qwerty keyboard and 3.1 - inch hvga screen			0
the @entity103 will cost about $ 130 and comes with a 3.7 - inch wvga screen , 800 mhz processor and 3 - megapixel camera			0
( all prices are after rebates , and with a two - year contract			0
) @entity117 reports , " all three devices require a data package beginning at $ 15 per month as well as qualify for an early termination fee of up to $ 325			0
" in the october 7 episode of @entity123 podcast , host @entity124 and @entity125 from smartphone experts discussed the pros and cons of several lower - end @entity5 feature phones shown at the @entity14 conference			1
@entity124 and @entity125 also discussed the new sprint id service for @entity5 phones , which debuted at @entity14			1
through partnerships with content providers like @entity135 and @entity136 , @entity38 is selling prepackaged sets of apps , ringtones , widgets , wallpaper and more for its @entity5 phones			1
" the idea is that it 's a pain for many people to figure out how to customize your @entity5 phone , " @entity125 said			0
" yes , it 's bloatware -- but it 's a place to start and you at least get to pick which bloatware you want			0

vendors at @entity14 conference introduce phones all under $ 150 , some as cheap as $ 50
new @entity5 phones may not offer same features and speed as higher - end smartphones
carriers have already revealed prices for data plans for these phones
