@entity4 , which wants the six powers to recognize what it says is the peaceful nature of its nuclear energy pursuits , laid out confidential proposals in the morning			1
a spokesman for the @entity22 's foreign policy chief called the presentation " very useful			1
" the two - day talks in @entity0 bring together @entity4 's representatives with those from the so - called @entity27 -- the @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , all countries with permanent seats on the @entity35 , plus @entity36			1
talks continued in the afternoon , and will resume on wednesday			0
" for the first time , we had very detailed technical discussions , " a senior @entity39 official said			0
ahead of the talks : @entity28 hopeful but ' clear - eyed ' @entity4 deputy foreign minister @entity44 , who is taking a lead role in the negotiations , said tuesday that the " negotiation 's environment was positive , " according to @entity4 's semi-official @entity48 news agency			1
many in the @entity52 fear @entity4 is pursuing the development of a nuclear bomb , but @entity4 -- slapped with sanctions because of its program -- has always maintained that it is developing nuclear energy capabilities for peaceful purposes only			1
@entity22 foreign policy chief @entity59 is chairwoman for the talks for the @entity27 bloc , while @entity4 foreign minister @entity62 is leading the @entity4 delegation			1
ahead of tuesday 's meeting , @entity62 said he hoped that together , @entity4 and the @entity52 would be able to work out a " road map " toward a final resolution by wednesday			2
@entity68 's spokesman , @entity67 , said that the mood was one of " cautious optimism " but that the " ball is in @entity4 's court " to respond to the bloc 's concerns			1
the @entity27 bloc put forward its own proposals at a meeting with @entity4 in @entity79 in the spring , and these remain on the table , @entity67 told reporters earlier			0
' verifiably proven ' the talks , which are being conducted in @entity83 for the first time , are due to last two days , but the timetable is fluid , @entity67 said			0
" we have said we want @entity4 to engage constructively with proposals we have put forward			0
or , if they want to , they can come up with their own proposals , " he said			0
" what matters is the end result -- that they address the international community 's concerns about the purely peaceful nature of the @entity4 nuclear program			2
" we have to reach a situation at the end where they have proven , and verifiably proven , that there is no nuclear military program			0
that is the end result that is being sought			0
" the @entity4 ' powerpoint presentation , laid out in @entity83 , was titled " closing @entity106 , @entity107			0
" @entity44 said @entity4 's goal is to guarantee its citizens ' rights to " enjoy nuclear energy , including enrichment , along with the verification of its peaceful program , " according to the @entity48 news agency			1
critics have expressed suspicions about @entity4 's uranium enrichment , fearing that @entity4 may secretly be transforming nuclear fuel into atomic bomb - grade materials			1
during a visit to the @entity123 in september , @entity12 's diplomatic approach raised hopes in the @entity52 of a thaw in relations with @entity127 and progress in negotiations on its nuclear program			2
@entity12 's visit culminated in a phone call with @entity28 president @entity134 and a meeting between @entity28 secretary of state @entity136 and @entity62			0
@entity4 nuclear talks are key topic as @entity134 , @entity140 meet it was the first such high - level contact between the two sworn enemies since @entity4 's 1979 revolution , which sent relations between the two into a deep freeze			1
@entity147 : do n't relax sanctions too early @entity147 prime minister @entity140 urged the international community not to relax too soon the painful economic sanctions that have put @entity4 's leaders under " intense pressure " to return to talks			1
" i think it would be a historic mistake to ease the sanctions when they are so close to achieving their goals , " he said			0
" now is an opportune moment to reach a genuine diplomatic solution that peacefully ends @entity4 's military nuclear program			2
" this opportunity can only be realized if the international community continues to place pressure on @entity4 , because it is that pressure that has brought @entity4 back to the negotiations in the first place			0
and it is that pressure which makes the peaceful dismantling of @entity4 's military nuclear program possible			1
" @entity4 's president : we 're open to nuclear talks , but do n't make threats @entity147 's @entity175 also warned tuesday against conceding too much too soon to the @entity4			1
" @entity147 does not oppose @entity4 having peaceful nuclear energy			2
this does not require uranium enrichment or plutonium			0
@entity4 's nukes prog does , " @entity140 spokesman @entity180 said via @entity181			1
could @entity183 sabotage @entity4 - @entity28 thaw ? a country that " regularly deceives the international community " does not have a " right to enrich " as @entity4 claims , he said			0
a senior @entity134 administration official told reporters in @entity0 that the administration would be willing to consider quick relief on sanctions " targeted in proportion " to what @entity4 puts on the table , should it be prepared to curtail the pace and scope of its uranium enrichment program , offer steps to improve transparency of its nuclear program , and address concerns about its stockpile of enriched uranium			2
@entity206 : ' we are ready ' @entity206 , @entity4 's powerful parliamentary speaker and a close associate of the nation 's supreme leader , ayatollah @entity209 , said last week that @entity4 is serious about resolving the dispute over its nuclear program			2
it is keen to resolve the issue " in a short period of time , " @entity206 told @entity2 's @entity216 in an exclusive interview from @entity0			0
" from @entity4 's side , i can say that we are ready , " he said			2
@entity12 : nuclear weapons have no place in @entity4 's security " if the @entity28 and other countries say that @entity4 should not develop a nuclear bomb or should not move towards that , then we can clearly show and prove that			1
we have no such intention			0
so it can be resolved in a very short period of time			0
" nonetheless , @entity206 said , the @entity52 must accept @entity4 's right to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes , as allowed under the @entity233 , to which @entity4 is a signatory			1
building trust some believe that @entity4 's recent apparent willingness to negotiate seriously over its nuclear program is a result of the crippling sanctions on its economy			1
shortly after this year 's @entity123 ended , a @entity39 official said the @entity28 would be prepared to consider relaxing certain sanctions on @entity4 if it took confidence - building steps to prove its sincerity to negotiate over its nuclear program			2
but this will take time and the building of trust			0
@entity28 under secretary of state @entity251 , who is in @entity0 , stressed that the entire sanctions regime targeting @entity4 would not be lifted " any time soon " unless the array of concerns about @entity4 's nuclear program was fully addressed			1
