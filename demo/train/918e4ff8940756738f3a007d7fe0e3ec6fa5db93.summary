-- just 20 years ago , when the world was entering a new era of high technology and test - driving the information super highway that is now the @entity6 , @entity1 still battled the racist apartheid of the @entity8 and suffered in the poverty of an almost bankrupt state			1
today , almost 20 years since @entity11 established the country as a democracy , @entity1 is the economic powerhouse of @entity15 and the largest economy in the second largest continent in the world			1
" i almost joke and say we directly moved from drums to cell phones , without the entire generation of landline technology , " said @entity19 , @entity20 to the @entity21			0
as the country launched a satellite last week , @entity19 suggests the next generation is already being developed and technology is one of the brightest areas for future economic growth			2
according to a recent report released by investment banking giant @entity35 , @entity1 's @entity36 has since almost tripled to $ 400 billion ; foreign exchange reserves have increased from $ 3 billion to nearly $ 50 billion ; and a growing and sizable @entity1 middle class was created , within two decades of freedom			1
" perhaps the most striking successes since 1994 are the creation of a growing and sizable @entity1 middle class , increased real wages for the employed , and the extension of social welfare and services to underprivileged communities , " said @entity40 , managing director at @entity35			1
@entity40 , who 's the head of investment banking for @entity15 , says in the first 14 years of democracy the country 's ethnically @entity1 middle class more than doubled in size and in the past two decades real gdp per capita increased by 40 % , while 10 million @entity1 , one out of five , graduated from the lower to the middle and higher income bands			1
however , many , including @entity40 himself , realize how poverty , inequality , and unemployment continue to haunt this nation of 52 million			1
" structural unemployment and racial economic inequality continues to plague @entity1			1
five million jobs have been added in the past 20 years , but insufficient to lower the overall rate of unemployment			0
now 14 million people are working and 7 million are not , " said @entity40 , who adds that unlocking job opportunities for more @entity1 would unleash tremendous growth			2
in loosening these restraints , @entity19 says education is the most important challenge to address , where there are marked inconsistencies between the working class 's education and skills verses the growing markets and jobs			2
according to @entity79 % of @entity1 's population is under the age of 35 and that 's where , among black people , unemployment is the highest			1
he also says the majority of these youths who grew up under apartheid " are not unemployed , but rather unemployable " due to illiteracy and lack of skills			0
@entity19 argues many traditional areas of employment , such as agriculture , mining and textiles , are either mechanized or replaced by cheap labor -- suggesting that " in order to move this generation to the next we need to find a way to put the skills and the jobs together			0
" this is a hurdle that @entity104 , head of @entity105 , a @entity1 think tank in social and economic development , traces to a lack of education -- even among the teachers who school the young generation that is getting ready to enter the workforce			2
according to @entity114 around 80 % of public schools are dysfunctional and the quality of schooling for the majority of poor people is abysmal			0
she suggests the key reform is to introduce performance management of principals and teachers			0
" we can not allow a situation to continue where many teachers do not come to school on mondays and fridays , when they are in class they do not teach much , and where they often are unable to pass tests in the very subject they are supposed to be teaching , " said @entity114			0
reports indicate that internal corruption remains a problem in @entity1 , but the government says it has been clamping down on corrupt officials , with 2,638 officials found guilty of misconduct related to corrupt activities between 1 september 2004 and 31 august 2013			2
but still government management faces other challenges ; " the government needs to be clearer on its priorities , and its approach to regulation and the role of markets , for the country to achieve a coherent approach to the most important issues of job creation , fdi and growth , " said @entity40 , who believes in the need for collaboration to encourage and facilitate private companies to invest in the country			0
but despite the challenges the country faces , @entity19 praises what @entity1 have accomplished in their short experience with democracy and freedom			1
" twenty years ago , many of these people had no electricity , water and had their lands taken away from them , " said @entity19 , who praises programs such as accessible healthcare , social security networks and programs that look after young children , elderly , and the disabled			0
according to @entity19 , 20 years from now , half of @entity1 's population will be under the age of 35 ; and based on the @entity35 report , in the longer term , if the country could raise economic growth from an average 3.3 % over the last 20 years to 5 % per annum over the next 20 years , it would half formal unemployment over that period			1
in a country where millions are still taunted by the miserable memories of apartheid , others who have no memories of the past are impatient to move forward in haste			0
" the young black people with the memory of apartheid are patient because they know what they have now is infinitely better than the past ; but those with no memory from the past have aspirations beyond what 's immediately available at hand , " said @entity19			0
he adds that in order to create another 20 years of robust growth for @entity1 the two have to meet hand in hand .			2

new report praises @entity1 's *transformation* since apartheid
huge growth in country 's gdp and in middle class
but poverty , inequality , and unemployment remain a problem
