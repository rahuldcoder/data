-- what if you saw your city as a giant obstacle course ? buildings were there to be leaped from , railings hurdled over , rooftops rolled across			0
suddenly the morning commute is n't so boring when you 're scaling concrete walls @entity9 - style , or balancing along ledges with the stealth of @entity13			1
there are countless ways to move through our urban spaces -- so why do we often plod along with the crowd ? a growing community sees things differently			0
this is parkour , a daring discipline where people bound around concrete jungles in the most efficient way possible -- if that means leaping from building to building high above the gridlock below , then so be it			1
they rely only on their bodies , using the city 's surfaces to powerfully propel themselves forward , reading the landscape with an almost animal instinct			1
t school of hard knocks can anyone become a parkour pro ? i 'm about to find out -- starting from the inside			2
in a converted shipment yard in east @entity41 , ripped young men spring across concrete blocks with the ease of panthers			1
they are training in the @entity47 's first purpose - built parkour center -- a sign not just of how popular this once - underground activity has become , but how organized			1
a vast warehouse has been decked - out to resemble the urban landscape , filled with a haphazard assortment of steel railings , brick walls , and giant trucks tires			2
a gentle electronic soundtrack plays in the background			0
why practice parkour inside , when there 's a whole world to explore outside these four walls ? " we wanted somewhere you could train without worrying about residents complaining or being kicked off by the police -- and fair enough , if you are jumping on somebody 's walls , they might not like it , " explained 27 - year - old @entity62 , who four years ago quit his job as a high court civil servant to teach parkour full - time			1
" we do n't expect people to stop training outside , and we would n't want them to			2
but especially for those starting out , this place can be really useful -- it 's a community of people to learn from			1
" an ideal introduction for those like myself , whose sporting prowess is limited to running after the bus or squeezing myself onto a train at rush hour			2
there are no soft furnishing in this cavernous concrete building , and before i attempt my first challenge -- leaping over a waist - high steel railing -- i 'm giving a word of warning			2
" this is n't a gymnastics center , " says @entity62			2
" you ca n't fall on your head here and be fine			0
" urban acrobats twenty minutes later i find myself hanging upside down from a four - meter - high concrete wall , gripping on for dear life			2
" it really pushes you mentally to face fear and overcome it , " says @entity62 , who first took up parkour because he was " bored out of his brain at the gym			0
" " once you start training , your vision expands			0
it frees you in a huge way			0
you see a railing on your way to the train station and think ' i 'm not going to go three feet out of my way			0
i can go over that			0
" even in my panicked state gently rolling backwards down a wall , blood rushing to my head and the center swimming before my eyes , a strange thought looms before me			0
' this is so much cooler than the gym			0
' lights , camera , action since it emerged in @entity132 in the 1980s , parkour has been as hard to pin down as the people who practice it , used as everything from a way to keep fit , to security training , and even film stunts			1
in the opening scenes of @entity142 film " @entity143 , " @entity139 leaps , rolls , and hurdles after a bad guy through a bustling construction site -- culminating in a spectacular dive between two cranes			1
this is no ordinary villain , but @entity151 , one of the founders of parkour , and the pair perform moves so death - defying , you might think they were the work of special effects alone			1
" it 's almost expected now that when a superhero is traveling across the city , they 'll be able to do parkour , because it looks cooler for them to run down the street and vault over a bin , than to just run in a straight line , " says @entity62			1
" people do a class and assume the first thing i 'm going to ask them to do is a triple backflip -- it could n't be further from the truth			0
most of the training we do is low and safe			0
" power and beauty the academy now hopes to train uniformed forces			1
as @entity62 says , a police officer who can chase someone over a wall , is going to be much more valuable than one who struggles to keep up			0
despite his bulky physique , there is an elegance to the way @entity62 lightly leaps over wooden barriers , and it 's easy to see why parkour is also increasingly being used on stage -- the group is currently working on a performance of " @entity198 "			1
one thing 's for certain , parkour will make that journey down the rabbit hole a lot more interesting			1
