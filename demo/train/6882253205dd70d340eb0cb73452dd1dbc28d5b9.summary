-- president @entity1 got help from his wife and his vice president wednesday in continuing a public pressure campaign on republicans to join @entity7 in passing his $ 447 billion jobs plan			1
first lady @entity10 announced that 270 private companies have pledged to hire 25,000 veterans and their spouses by the end of 2013			1
the companies are part of a trade group called the @entity18			0
their commitment , she said , would fulfill 25 % of the president 's call for private - sector companies to hire or train 100,000 veterans and military spouses in the next two years			1
the first lady 's announcement preceded a speech by @entity1 at a joint military base in @entity30 on the third and last day of his bus tour through @entity33 and @entity30 aimed at pressuring @entity34 to pass his jobs package			1
@entity1 discussed the importance of hiring @entity38 veterans during a stop at the @entity40 , calling the initiative a top priority			2
" there are far too many veterans who are coming home and having to struggle to find a good job , " @entity1 said			2
" it does n't make any sense			0
" the president said , " we ask our men and women in uniform to leave their families			0
" the last thing you should have to do is fight for a job when you come home , " he said			0
he also called on @entity34 to pass his jobs bill , saying the need to focus on jobs was " an @entity38 responsibility			1
" later in the day , @entity1 used a speech to firefighters in @entity65 , @entity30 , to urge @entity66 to stop opposing his jobs plan			1
@entity66 counter-proposals to cut regulations and roll back health care and @entity72 reforms failed to address the need to reduce unemployment , @entity1 argued			1
" dirtier air , dirtier water , fewer people on health care , no accountability on @entity72 -- that is not a jobs plan , " @entity1 said			2
" i 'm happy to have a debate , but in the meantime , let 's focus on putting people back to work			0
" in particular , @entity1 called for @entity34 to pass one component of his plan that would provide funding for state and local governments to hire police officers , firefighters and teachers			2
the measure would be paid for by increasing the tax rate on millionaires by 0.5 %			0
" my taxes will go up a little bit , but i can afford it , " @entity1 said			2
vice president @entity99 also pushed for the measure , telling a @entity102 @entity7 rally in support of the jobs plan that the specific provision meant someone earning $ 1.1 million a year would pay an extra $ 500 in taxes			1
" and you know the really sad thing about it is ? the millionaires know we should do this			0
they do n't oppose this , " @entity99 said			0
" they know it is the equitable thing to do			0
" @entity66 have blocked debate on the @entity1 jobs plan in the @entity102			1
they argue that any tax increase would harm economic growth and job creation , while @entity1 and @entity7 contend that the president 's package ensures immediate job growth			2
asked by @entity0 why @entity1 kept pushing a tax hike that @entity66 continually reject , @entity99 said the debate exposed @entity66 reluctance to work with the @entity127 and @entity7 on an agreement			1
" there 's not a single thing they are for , " @entity99 said			0
" how can they argue against a half - percent surtax on people whose average income is a million bucks ? " @entity136 leader @entity136 of @entity137 accused @entity1 of using his bus trip for political campaigning instead of working with @entity66 on jobs legislation that can pass with support from both parties			1
" everyone knows the last thing you want to do in a jobs crisis is raise taxes , " @entity143 said on the @entity102 floor			0
" but for some reason , he 's determined to keep trying anyway , and @entity66 are n't about to go along with it			0
" calling @entity1 " completely out of touch , " @entity143 said the @entity127 and @entity34 should " forget about the tax hikes , let 's drop the talking points about millionaires and billionaires , and let 's work together on bipartisan jobs legislation that 's designed to pass , not designed to fail			1
" @entity1 , however , continued to push for a public campaign to pressure republicans to pass his plan			2
" we 'll see if they fight just as hard for your job as they do for their own job , " he told the @entity30 firefighters			0
@entity7 are promising to force votes on individual components of the @entity1 plan , starting with $ 35 billion for states and localities to hire more teachers and first responders while preventing current ones from being laid off			1
that part of the plan could come up for a vote before the end of this week			0
@entity66 have accused the president of engaging in " class warfare , " while @entity7 say wealthier @entity38 need to share in the cost of fiscal responsibility			2
among other things , @entity1 's overall blueprint includes an extension and expansion of the current payroll tax cut , an extension of jobless benefits , new tax credits for businesses that hire the long - term unemployed and additional money to help save and create jobs for teachers and first responders such as firefighters			1
@entity0 's @entity200 and @entity201 contributed to this report .			0
