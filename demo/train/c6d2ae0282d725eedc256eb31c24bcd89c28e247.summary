-- " @entity7 , " the original 1982 light - show video - game thriller starring @entity1 as a software programmer trapped inside a brave new computer world of his own devising , is a movie that i , like many others , found to be such a tinny , dehumanized piece of techno - kitsch that i was shocked to learn it has since become a cult film			1
seeing it again , though , i think i know why			0
twenty - eight years later , " tron " exerts a campy - surreal , here 's what the future looked like before it arrived fascination that it never enjoyed during its initial run			1
in 1982 , when it was the closest thing @entity22 had to a picture for adults , it was basically a demo reel of special effects in search of a movie			2
yet if you see it today , it can stand as the first prehistoric @entity32 version of cyberspace , and it 's fun to behold the eager , at times shockingly primitive ways that it imagines the '' wondrous '' computer future : as a frictionless @entity39 grid that looks like the most analog of head trips			2
few science - fiction films have been simultaneously so ahead of their time and so instantly , touchingly dated -- so behind the eight ball of their own technology			0
" tron " made the virtual almost leadenly literal			0
it was the soul of a new machine locked inside the hardware of an old one			0
the cult of " tron " is hardly so big that you could accuse " tron : legacy " of being a cynical attempt to cash in on a franchise			1
( more than just a bomb , the first " tron " was a major embarrassment for @entity22 ; out - of - print @entity58 copies are now about as hard to hunt down as @entity60 head cleaners			1
) that said , the studio has had a long time to ponder its mistake , and " tron : @entity68 , " unlike its predecessor , really does make novelty look cool			1
it 's a sleeker , sharper , far more visually intoxicating machine dream of a movie , with a darkly liquid electronic texture all its own			0
when @entity75 ( @entity74 ) , the son of the now mysteriously vanished @entity76 ( @entity1 ) , visits his dad 's dusty , abandoned @entity79 and ends up getting sucked -- through a " @entity7 " videogame ! -- into the virtual world of the grid , he gets outfitted for action ( black uniform with neon piping ) , and then is thrust onto the combat stage of a gladiatorial thunderdome			1
there , he faces off against assorted digital soldiers , all wielding lethal @entity90 of light			0
the kitsch element is still there -- basically , this is the story of what it 's like to be turned into a kill - or - be - killed videogame icon -- but the director , @entity97 , stages the extreme fighting with a fleet and threatening charge			1
the fx in " tron : @entity68 " have an almost @entity103 elegance : they infuse light with gravity			1
if one of the discs hits a combatant , he 'll shatter into glassy fragments , and @entity75 , absorbing the physics of the game , must learn to treat his body almost as part of the surrounding architecture			0
he becomes a ruthless digital specter			0
as long as it 's engaged in light - hurling bouts of force , or motorcycle chases through a landscape so ominously enveloping it looks like " @entity123 " after gentrification , " tron : @entity68 " is a catchy popcorn pleasure			1
the movie has a seductive , percolating , what 's - old - is - new - again musical score by the @entity130 electronica duo @entity131 , and for lengthy swatches of it i grooved on the look and the atmosphere			1
@entity97 's direction is just intriguing enough to leave you hoping that when @entity75 finally locates his father amid all those irradiated bytes and bits , the story will really take off			0
but " tron : @entity68 " turns out to be a little too much like one of those logy trapped - on - @entity145 sci - fi movies from the 1950s : there 's a lot of dramatic stasis undergirding the visual wow			1
it transpires that @entity152 has n't been doing much for 20 years but sitting around -- the portal that would allow him to leave has been sealed off -- and his fascist nemesis , returning from the first film , is once again @entity156 , now played by a digitized version of the young @entity1			1
in his rubbery botox - android way , he 's creepy to look at ( and he makes you wonder if this will be the future for aging movie stars ) , but there is n't much to @entity156 besides his telegenic blank stare			2
here , as in " @entity7 , " there are limits to how much technology can really express			2
as @entity76 , @entity1 acts very beatnik @entity167 , like a weary cyber version of the dude , and @entity170 is on hand as a sinister nightclub impresario who primps and soft - shoes like an albino @entity174 wearing @entity177 's @entity176 shag			1
@entity178 , as @entity75 's cybernetic love interest , does some pretty standard punk - arm - candy posing			2
one reason the original " tron " was greeted with so much hostility is that it seemed , in its cheesy synthesized way , to represent a brave new world not just of digital outer space , but of movies consumed by their own effects			2
at the time , this was a future a lot of people did n't want to see @entity32 embrace			0
but , of course , it 's the future that won out			0
and that may be the true legacy of " tron			2
" the sequel , more successfully ( if less innocently ) , injects you into a luminous action matrix and asks you to be happy with the ride			1
but it 's easier now not to object			0
at the movies , the fantastical - synthetic has become a state of mind that we 're never allowed to escape			0
