tuesday is @entity0 , and there will be speeches and parades			1
" thank you for your service , " the phrase that 's come to define how @entity7 expresses gratitude for its men and women in uniform , will be said , a lot			2
but what does a holiday -- a single day -- really mean to the 19.6 million veterans it 's meant to honor ? @entity17 asked a few of them			1
their answer : go beyond the holiday			2
they encouraged a constant , creative and sensitive focus on veterans ' needs , like improving access to jobs and health care , particularly at @entity29 ' affairs facilities			1
on monday the @entity31 ' new secretary announced massive restructuring at the scandal - plagued agency			0
but the most productive thing anyone outside the military can do is actually very simple and easy , they say : strike up a conversation with a veteran			1
get to know one of them in a meaningful way			0
there is a wide cultural gap between @entity7 who have no relationship with the @entity48 and those who 've served their country			1
closing that gap is as necessary as it is long overdue			1
here are five ways to connect with veterans all year round			1
check your assumptions " veterans are very often stereotyped into two stock characters : the crying wounded or the guy who jumps the @entity63 fence to get to the president , " said @entity58 , the executive director of the @entity59 , a national nonprofit with more than 200,000 members			1
" do n't treat us like victims , " said @entity58 , an @entity65 graduate and former @entity67 investment analyst who led an @entity69 platoon in @entity70 in 2003 and 2004			1
" we 're not broken			0
we 've been through a lot , but we 're rising out of it			0
" while national discussion and media coverage of post-traumatic stress disorder has chipped away at some of the generations - old entrenched stigma associated with mental illness , many of these stories involving @entity84 make headlines because they involve violence , @entity58 said			0
it 's critical for everyone to remember that having ptsd does n't mean a person will be violent , and not every veteran has ptsd			1
each veteran has a unique story			1
their military service has probably shaped them in profound ways , but they are not the sum total of that time			0
take the time get to know one of them			0
they have a lot of lessons to share			0
five things you may not know about post-traumatic stress disorder invest in veterans -- it 's good business one of the biggest hurdles service members face after leaving the military is finding a job			1
about 77 % of veterans have struggled through unemployment and more than a quarter have searched for more than a year for a job , according to @entity59			1
but there 's reason for hope , judging by recent figures from the @entity7 @entity122			0
the unemployment rate for post 9/11 veterans peaked in january 2011 at 15.2 % , @entity123 reported			1
in october 2013 , there was 10 % unemployment			0
last month , the job picture for veterans improved as unemployment hovered around 7 %			1
( the national unemployment rate is 5.8 %			0
) many corporations have launched new hiring initiatives for veterans			1
in april 2013 , @entity134 pledged to give 100,000 veterans jobs within five years			1
in november 2013 , @entity136 launched a nationwide initiative to hire 10,000 veterans and spouses by the end of 2018			1
@entity141 is driving programs to hire veterans			1
want to hire a veteran ? the @entity145 should provide a financial incentive			1
for veterans who need jobs , the veterans job bank and resources on the @entity31 website might help			1
trouble traveling ? the @entity153 will host a virtual career fair on tuesday			0
thanks for your service , vets ! now trying finding a job help veterans ' families , too while it 's well known that 22 veterans a day kill themselves , a @entity17 investigation revealed that many military family members also have attempted or contemplated suicide			1
" @entity168 " examined how war 's trauma can wrack entire families			0
family members have endured unprecedented multiple deployments during two wars , in @entity172 and @entity70 , lasting more than a decade			0
that means financial and emotional stress for relatives			0
if a family member returns from war , it 's often the relatives who must care for them			1
" if we ca n't figure out a way to provide better support for families , the public will pay one way or another , " said @entity181 , executive director of @entity182 , which tries to bridge the gap between military and civilian communities			1
@entity181 : i was a military spouse who knew wives who killed themselves every family member interviewed for " @entity168 " expressed the same need to be understood by those whose lives had nothing to do with the military			0
they did n't want to be thought of as " the other			1
" " do n't be afraid to approach us			1
this heartache i have -- it makes other people uncomfortable			0
it hits them in a place that scares them , " said @entity210 parent @entity209 , whose son @entity211 died in @entity172 in 2008			0
his daughter committed suicide two years later , an act her parents believe was inextricably tied to losing @entity211			0
" it can hurt so much more when we feel like we 're making other people uncomfortable by talking about our kids , " @entity209 said			0
" do n't push military family members away because you 're afraid you 'll say the wrong thing			2
just asking us means you care , and that means everything			2
" volunteer with veterans ' programs whether it 's a simple conversation with a veteran or their family member or volunteering , get involved			1
figure out what you do best and offer that skill			0
if you 're a mental health professional , donate your services to give an hour , which connects counselors to service members , veterans and their families			1
reach out to @entity246 , @entity247 , which connects family members who have lost service members and veterans in similar ways			2
for instance , if someone 's brother died of an ied attack in @entity70 , @entity246 links that person with a peer who has lost a sibling in @entity70			0
the @entity260 and @entity261 also connects military families with leaders in the civilian community			0
" @entity168 " highlighted an innovative @entity266 clinic that broke from the traditional approach by linking the @entity31 and a private hospital system so both could operate in a single shared office space			0
patients , including one @entity70 veteran and his wife , credit the clinic for saving their marriage			2
the @entity275 has recently secured funding for a yearlong study of the clinic 's efficacy to see if the program should be replicated across the country , said senior adviser to the project @entity284 , whose career has been focused on veterans issues			2
an overwhelming number of nonprofits and community groups have popped up over the past decade , making it harder to find a good one , she and others say			0
@entity284 recommended @entity29 , which is intended to help people in the community link to veterans			2
the effort spans the country , and is based at medical and academic institutions in @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity266 , @entity304 , @entity305 , and @entity306 , @entity307			0
read an in - depth analysis of the program			0
pressure the @entity31 the @entity31 is the second largest agency in the @entity7 government , rivaled in size only by the @entity313			0
since november 2013 , @entity17 has been investigating and reporting about the department 's failures to adequately treat veterans			1
records of dead veterans were changed or physically altered in an effort to hide how many people died waiting for treatment at a @entity322 , @entity17 reported			2
investigators issued a scathing report that outlined 24 recommendations for change , including a firm determination of how soon a veteran should be treated and a total overhaul of the @entity31 's appointment system			2
part of the shake - up spelled the end of @entity335 veteran and former @entity69 chief of staff @entity337 's job as @entity31 secretary			2
he was replaced by @entity341 , a @entity342 graduate who led @entity343 to incredible success			0
@entity341 told " @entity350 " on sunday that he plans to make it much simpler for veterans to get care ; they 'll have to search only one website , not dozens as they must now			1
management will change and people who do n't share the @entity31 's core values wo n't work there anymore			2
@entity58 , the @entity70 and @entity172 veterans ' organization leader , told @entity17 that @entity341 has shown himself to be far more active and aware of the @entity31 's problems and has showed an eagerness to work with veterans to change the agency			2
but he also urged people to write their members of @entity363 to make sure addressing the @entity31 's problems remains a priority			0
" we feel like ( @entity341 ) is different because he 's actually taken the time to meet veterans and ask them what they need , " said @entity58			2
" but there has to be much more			0
everyone in this country -- beyond us , beyond veterans -- must make sure that the people who can fix the @entity31 stick to their promises and make it happen			2

do something to help veterans all days of the year , not just on @entity0
major needs for veterans include better access to jobs and health care
get to know a veteran to help bridge the cultural gap
" do n't treat us like victims , " veteran says
