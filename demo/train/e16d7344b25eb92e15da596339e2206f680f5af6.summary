if the @entity1 had lived , he would have been 80 on thursday			1
for @entity3 , this year brings another significant anniversary worth celebrating			2
twenty - five years ago , he decided to quit his job selling power tools to become @entity9 's only professional @entity8 fan			1
" i was a sales agent for a long time and i decided i did n't want to be that anymore			0
i thought , imagine if i could be a full - time @entity8 fan , " he says			1
" i knew it was a big leap but i felt like i just had to do it			0
and a few years later i was			0
" even by the obsessive levels of fandom still inspired by the defining entertainer of the 20th century nearly four decades after his death , @entity3 takes his duties seriously			2
he 's sitting in a diner booth in the replica of @entity8 's @entity21 mansion he 's built on the outskirts of his hometown of @entity24 in central @entity25			1
" we get a lot of @entity28 stopping off			0
if not for the memorabilia , then for the food , " says @entity3			1
@entity8 sandwiches there are not , it has to be said , too many other dining options for the bequiffed @entity36 trucker with a penchant for blue suede shoes , fresh off the ferry from @entity40 and hungering for a peanut butter , jam , banana and bacon sandwich -- the diner 's tribute in cholesterol to its hero 's all - american appetite			1
like the ebullient @entity3 , @entity50 is larger than life			1
from outside , the neo-classical entrance , guarded by stone lions , and green shutters are unmistakable , but it 's twice the size of the @entity57 original where @entity8 lived from 1957 until his death in 1977			2
as well as the diner , the mansion houses @entity3 's $ 1.6 million - valued collection of memorabilia -- instruments and outfits , plus more idiosyncratic items such as cufflinks given to @entity8 by @entity67 president @entity66 , and a baseball glove he used while serving as a soldier in @entity71			1
the collection also features a photo of @entity9 's current @entity74 and other @entity76 royals meeting @entity8 during a visit to @entity78 in 1960			1
" that 's a great piece , because you can talk about it to @entity9 , who are very proud of their queen , and to @entity67 because they like royalty , " @entity3 says			1
the shop is a treasure trove for vinyl collectors			0
a casual browse uncovers exotic albums from the former @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 , and a @entity94 rarity featuring alternate tracks by @entity8 and swivel - hipped 1980s @entity97 wonder @entity98			1
' all in good taste ' downstairs in the museum , " @entity102 " -- @entity8 's seminal satellite broadcast from 1973 -- plays on a perpetual loop , while @entity24 also broadcasts " @entity105 , " a 24 - 7 radio station available via a smartphone app astutely summed up by one reviewer as " brilliant if you like @entity8			1
" @entity3 's personally led tours and boundless enthusiasm are a big part of the attraction			2
" in 1972 i became an @entity8 fan , and i was 13 when he died , " he says			1
" for me it started with the music			0
it 's hard to explain			0
i listened to all kinds of music back then and still today but there is nothing that catches my interest like @entity8			2
" disappointingly for more morbid - minded @entity8 obsessives , there 's no replica of the upstairs bathroom suite where he famously left the building for the final time , with the first floor instead serving as a function room			1
" we realize we are on a thin line here , " explains @entity3			2
" is it tacky ? is it cool ? is it a joke ? most people who come here get it			0
we think we have done this in good taste			0
" @entity3 hit on the idea of building a @entity21 in 2006 when he saw a replica of @entity145 during a visit to @entity147			1
by then he 'd been successfully staging exhibitions since 1993 and was looking for a permanent home for his expanding collection			0
" i wondered how much it would be , and thought maybe five million kroner ( $ 822,000 )			2
i contacted an architect -- i knew his wife was an @entity8 fan and that was why i dared even call him			1
" we went to @entity57 to see the real thing			0
and when we came home he did some drawings and said ' it 's not five million kroner , it 's 20 million			2
' " birthday treat backed by local business and civic leaders , the house opened at an eventual cost of 26 million kroner ( $ 4.27m ) in 2011 and now draws almost 120,000 visitors a year			2
" there was never a business plan , but one step just led to the next , " says @entity3			2
" if someone had told me in 1972 that i would be living off @entity8 i 'd have said they were crazy			0
if you 'd told me in 1990 that i 'd have people working for me then i 'd have said you were crazy			0
" and if somebody had told me that we would build @entity21 in @entity24 i would n't have believed it			0
" these days @entity3 is a major player in the @entity8 industry , even without the blessing of @entity178 ( @entity178 ) , which licenses official products and ventures , and has been touted as a potential buyer of @entity8 's planes , which were put up for sale last year			1
" i have a nice letter which @entity185 [ @entity8 , @entity8 's ex-wife ] wrote to @entity187 with a smiley face , but @entity178 do n't like us at all			1
i think they should be grateful that someone is putting money in their pockets			0
" all the merchandise we sell is licensed , and i am bringing @entity9 to @entity67 on @entity8 tours			1
" still , @entity3 's devotion has delivered a birthday treat for local fans with the @entity200 , @entity8 's backing musicians during his @entity201 years , and others who shared a stage with him set to perform in @entity24 on thursday night			1
" we have the @entity200 , which is the band he used from 1969 until his death			0
then we have his backup singers , the @entity206 , and we have his musical director , @entity207			0
" for them to be here in @entity24 , of all the places in the world , on his birthday , i think it 's pretty remarkable			0
" @entity214 , @entity215 3 , 8960 @entity187 , @entity9 ; +45 86 42 96 96 @entity216 has worked as a journalist covering international news , politics and sports for websites and publications including @entity2 , the @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225			0
he was named @entity226 at the @entity227			0
