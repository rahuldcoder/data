@entity1 , @entity0 -- this year is the 50th birthday of the @entity4 , @entity6 's equivalent of @entity8 's @entity7			1
@entity10 's @entity9 salute their fans before a @entity4 match against @entity14 's @entity13			1
the @entity4 is the most prestigious tournament in @entity16 club football , seeing the best 32 teams in the continent battle for supremacy			2
it may not get as much attention as the @entity7 , but for @entity16 teams there is no bigger trophy			2
the tournament has reached semifinal stage , where @entity25 and @entity26 from @entity27 will clash with @entity10 's @entity28 and @entity14 's @entity29 - a team captained by former @entity32 star @entity31			1
so with the action reaching a crescendo , it 's high - time @entity36 explored what makes the compeition so great			0
history the competition was first held in 1960 , its name referring to the " liberators " who led @entity16 countries in their wars of independence			0
for years it was dominated by @entity10 , with a team from the country making it to every final between 1963 to 1979 , and @entity52 team @entity51 winning six times in that period			2
since the early ' 90s , it 's been the @entity27 clubs that have excelled			2
@entity27 has provided 10 libertadores finalists in the last 10 years , but since the tournament 's inception , every country except @entity59 and @entity60 has supplied a winner			2
qualification under current quotas @entity27 and @entity10 both supply five teams for the tournament , while @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity60 , @entity73 , @entity59 , @entity14 , @entity74 are each represented by three teams , with the previous year 's winner also qualifying			1
each country has different qualifying criteria for its clubs but essentially , the winners of @entity16 's top domestic leagues , as well as some runners up , qualify for the @entity4			0
they are joined by three teams invited from @entity60 ( which is not a member of @entity86 , the @entity86 )			0
better than @entity8 ? in terms of football quality , most would agree that the @entity4 struggles to match the @entity7 and the reason is simple -- @entity16 clubs simply do n't have the money to hold onto their best players			1
despite this , the @entity4 is still the place where some of the world 's best players cut their footballing teeth			0
the likes of @entity99 and @entity100 once shone in the @entity4 , as did past masters like @entity102 and @entity103			0
which do you think is better , the @entity4 or the @entity7 ? sound off below			1
while the tournament may lack big - name players , in other ways the @entity4 is as every bit as tough as the @entity7			1
@entity110 is the author of " @entity111			0
" he told @entity2 that in the @entity4 , teams often have to travel huge distances for away matches			0
it can take a @entity27 club 24 hours to get to a match in @entity60 , leaving little time for pre-match preparation or training			0
some teams play their matches at high altitude , which can be a grueling experience for visiting teams not used to the thin air			0
@entity110 says these factors can combine to make the @entity4 less predictable than the @entity7 , as can the fact that clubs regularly lose their best players to @entity8 , meaning their squads can change drastically from one season to the next			1
as in the @entity7 , big clubs , like @entity10 's @entity9 and @entity27 's @entity132 , usually make the final stages , but last year 's winners were unheralded @entity72 club @entity135 .			1

this year is the 50th birthday of @entity6 's @entity4
the competition has been dominated by @entity10 and @entity27 teams
@entity143 tends to be less predictable than @entity8 's @entity7
