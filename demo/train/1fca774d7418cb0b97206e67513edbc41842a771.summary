sen. @entity0 , who has been dogged by a federal corruption probe , suggests he was the target of a @entity4 intelligence smear plot over allegations -- which the @entity6 has discounted -- that he had sex with underage prostitutes in the @entity10			1
the @entity12 @entity11 told @entity13 in an exclusive interview on tuesday that the @entity15 should look at any evidence it may have that he was the subject of a conspiracy by the regime to spread false allegations			0
@entity0 said he has for years had a " firm position in opposition to the @entity4 regime " on grounds that it violates human rights			1
" the democracy of the people of @entity4 -- i have been outspoken in that regard , and i would n't be surprised that the regime would do anything it can to stop me from being in a position that ultimately would impede their hopes of getting a different relationship with the @entity36 based upon their interest not the interest of the @entity36 people , " he said			1
a @entity36 law enforcement official told @entity13 later tuesday that investigators have been aware of @entity0 's allegation about the @entity4 intelligence smear for some time			1
moreover , they have found no evidence to support the claim that @entity4 tried to smear the senator			1
from his perch as chairman of the @entity50 , @entity0 has pushed the @entity52 administration to hold the line on sanctions against the regime of @entity56			0
the @entity57 in @entity58 did n't immediately respond to a request for comment			0
but an article posted on the @entity4 government - run website @entity62 denied @entity0 's allegations			1
" the senator 's strategy is nothing more or less than to blame @entity4 , an old recourse of counter revolutionary @entity4 politicians to wash away their failings , " it said			0
the story added that the @entity4 government has " no ties " to the @entity76 which first reported the prostitution story			2
@entity6 found no merit in claim it 's a dramatic twist to an already sensational story			1
the @entity6 found no merit in the prostitution angle when it investigated previously			1
but the latest development may complicate an ongoing federal corruption probe of @entity0			0
his comments on @entity4 amount to a legal @entity87			0
authorities are investigating his relationship with political donors , including one whose ophthalmology practice in @entity92 has been scrutinized for its billing practices			0
the @entity94 first reported the latest turn in the story monday night , saying the suggestion of a @entity4 smear is based on a @entity100 finding that @entity4 intelligence agents were behind the prostitution claims			1
the @entity100 declined to comment			0
such a formal finding by the agency would be unusual -- though not unheard of -- because the @entity6 , not the @entity100 , has primary responsibility to investigate foreign intelligence operations against a @entity36 government official			1
a person familiar with the @entity0 legal strategy said his attorney , @entity110 , asked the @entity15 in a letter to investigate the @entity4 situation			2
@entity0 called any suggestion that he was trying to create a diversion or check the federal corruption probe with his @entity4 comments a " pretty far - fetched idea			1
" but he said that it " seems to me " the government " has the proof , " based on the @entity58 post reporting			0
" as far as i am concerned , you know , it is the government that should produce the information that they supposedly have within their own agencies , " @entity0 said			2
if the @entity100 finding is true , the person said , then the corruption probe would be tainted by the fact @entity0 was a victim of a foreign intelligence smear			0
2013 : sen. @entity0 faces scrutiny over ties to @entity92 doctor tipster triggered probe , stories the episode began in april 2012 when a tipster alerted the @entity140 in @entity58 , a watchdog group , that he had evidence @entity0 engaged in sex tourism by traveling to meet underage prostitutes in the @entity10			1
an @entity6 agent in @entity146 attempted to run down the tip , but nothing materialized			2
the tipster would n't provide additional information or talk to the agent , according to e-mail records forwarded to media			0
the purported prostitutes also recanted their claims			0
at the time , @entity0 was ascending to the top foreign affairs committee post in the @entity157 - controlled @entity50			0
the @entity6 's foray into that allegation dovetailed with the wider , ongoing federal investigation focused on the @entity92 donor , who for years has fought allegations that he overbilled @entity164			0
the @entity6 's investigation is also examining efforts by @entity0 to advocate on behalf of two @entity168 brothers , whose family members are political donors to him and who are fighting extradition to their homeland to face embezzlement charges			2
people familiar with the investigation say the overall probe continues , with the @entity6 and prosecutors still examining whether @entity0 broke any laws in his ties to political donors			2
