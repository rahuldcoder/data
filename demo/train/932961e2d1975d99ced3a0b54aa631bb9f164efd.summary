@entity0 , @entity1 -- with the utmost care and a healthy dose of respect , @entity3 brought the pontoon boat to a crawl , shut its engine down , and asked for quiet			0
she was careful not to disturb the small antenna , which floated on the surface of the @entity0 marking the location of @entity13 , an 800 pound manatee			2
" she is in a nice , quiet cove			0
perfect spot to be resting , " said @entity16 , a marine biologist with @entity17 to @entity18			0
" @entity20 and protected ... for now , " she said			0
these are uncertain days on the @entity0 , where boat tours take folks out to see the sea creatures , and where people can swim with them			0
knowing where these endangered manatees are will help marine biologists , if @entity30 oil makes its way into these waters where about 1,000 manatees reside			1
" we do know that the oil is toxic and depending on how weathered it is , it can have a lot of harmful effects if manatees come in contact with it , " said @entity34 , executive director of @entity35			1
" everything from coating their skin to getting in their eyes , to being ingested ... we do n't know specifically because it 's not been documented ... never happened as far as i know , " he said			2
is there oil near you ? share your story in winter , the gentle creatures -- sometimes called " sea cows " because of their underwater bucolic nature but actually more closely related to elephants -- congregate in the warm waters of the rivers , estuaries and springs along the @entity65			2
but in summer , manatees frequently leave the close confines of their winter spas and spread out along the @entity69 to @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 and around the @entity73 up the @entity75 coast			2
with the population more widespread , would - be rescuers face a difficult task			2
long the victims of accidental boat strikes and careless boaters , the @entity81 manatee population in the @entity82 stands at about 5,000 , experts believe			1
this past winter 's extended cold wiped out almost 10 percent of their number			2
and while everyone is hoping for the best , federal and state officials as well as environmental groups are planning for the worst			1
the @entity92 is the lead agency protecting manatees and other wildlife from the oil			1
" we do n't know how detrimental it will be if they inhale it , if they ingest it , if they 're foraging in areas where sea grass has been oiled , " said @entity97 , the manatee oil spill response coordinator with the @entity92			1
" we have no idea how that 's going to impact them , " she said			0
the @entity92 says that as its staff monitors the flow of the black crude across the @entity82 , they will use aerial flights to monitor manatees and other wildlife			1
they hope to have about 72 hours to respond to save manatees unknowingly swimming in the path of the oil -- including physically moving these mammals , which can reach 10 feet long and weigh 1,200 pounds			1
rescue teams are staging gear and will be ready to move in if necessary to try and capture manatees in distress			1
but rescuing large numbers of manatees has never been done before			0
is it realistic to capture large numbers of the sometimes uncooperative mammal ? " i do n't know the answer to that question but we 're going to move as many as we possibly can , " said @entity129			0
" if we had to move dozens , and it was a situation where we needed to move dozens , then i think we 've been assured that we can get the resources , the extra hands that we need to do that , " she said			0
@entity97 said that if manatees come into contact with oil , they will be cleaned with dish soap to break it up and to clean the surface of their bodies			1
they will be transported to one of two de-oiling stations -- the @entity150 in @entity151 , @entity72 , and the @entity152 , in @entity153 , @entity71			0
additional facilities in @entity1 include the @entity155 , @entity156 in @entity157 and the @entity158			0
once medically cleared , the animal will be transported to a long - term holding facility at @entity155 just south of the @entity161 , where many manatees have found a haven			0
according to the federal plan , no manatees will be released back into the wild until the threat of oil contamination is over			1
and even then , experts hope the seagrass beds and vegetation that manatees eat are n't destroyed by the oil			1
experts say they have a large network of people working together in partnerships , but accounting for every situation , and every scenario is doubtful			0
" capturing , rescuing hundreds of manatees , it 's never been done , " said @entity34 of @entity35 the @entity180			1
" we would lose manatees , i believe , if those kinds of numbers of manatees are involved			0

experts estimate manatee population in @entity82 at about 5,000
officials , groups planning for the worst if oil *encroaches*
rescue efforts could include cleaning manatees , physically moving them
" it 's never been done , " rescuer says
