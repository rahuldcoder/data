@entity0 , @entity1 -- alleged drug kingpin @entity3 was extradited thursday from @entity4 to the @entity5 , where he is to face drug and weapons charges			1
his extradition occurred two days after he was taken into custody in @entity4 and several hours after he had waived his right to an extradition hearing in @entity4			1
@entity3 arrived at about 7 p.m. at @entity0 - @entity12 outside @entity1			1
as a phalanx of armed @entity15 agents and @entity5 marshals paraded him in front of about a dozen reporters to a silver suv outside the terminal , @entity21 -- dressed in a blue open - necked shirt and black pants , his hands cuffed behind his back -- appeared subdued , a smirk on his face			1
" i love the people of @entity4 , " he said in response to a question from a @entity4 reporter			1
a @entity15 agent said he was to be taken to @entity1 and arraigned friday in federal court in @entity34			1
prior to his departure from @entity36 in @entity37 , he said in a statement that he had made the decision to waive his right to an extradition hearing of his own free will , and did so " even though i am of the belief that my case would have been successfully argued in the courts of @entity4			2
" according to a superseding indictment filed in @entity34 federal court , @entity21 has led a criminal organization known as the " @entity47 " since the early 1990s , with members in the @entity5 , @entity4 and other countries			1
" at @entity21 's direction and under his protection , members of his criminal organization sold marijuana and crack cocaine in the @entity1 area and elsewhere , and sent the narcotics proceeds back to @entity21 and his co-conspirators , " the @entity5 attorney for the @entity51 said in a statement			1
" @entity21 and his co-conspirators also armed their organization with illegally trafficked firearms , " the statement said			2
@entity3 , 40 , is charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine and marijuana and conspiracy to illegally traffic in firearms			2
if convicted on the narcotics charge , he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison , as well as a fine of up to $ 4 million			0
he faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on the firearms trafficking charge and a fine of up to $ 250,000			0
@entity3 was arrested on tuesday when @entity4 police recognized him at a checkpoint			1
last month 's failed attempt to arrest @entity3 sparked four days of gunbattles between security forces and his supporters in @entity37 that left 76 people dead			2
@entity3 , who is also known as " president , " " @entity89 " and " general , " said he was " deeply upset and saddened by the unnecessary loss of lives " and said the deaths " could have been avoided			2
" " everyone , the whole country , has been adversely affected by the process that has surrounded my extradition and i hope that my action today will go some way towards healing all who have suffered and will be of benefit to the community of @entity103 , " a neighborhood where violence erupted , he said			0
he said his decision to face charges in the @entity5 was made in " the best interest of my family , community of @entity37 and in particular the people of @entity103 and above all @entity4			1
" he was leaving his country with " a heavy heart " and is " fully confident that in due course i will be vindicated			0
" " pray for me and @entity115 bless @entity4 , " he said			2
a @entity4 opposition member , @entity116 , noted that since tuesday 's arrest there had been little unrest in @entity21 strongholds -- the neighborhoods of @entity122 and @entity103			1
the member of parliament and former national security minister attributed the calm to the fact that the government had declared a state of emergency and troops were in the streets			0
but the @entity131 issued a travel alert for @entity5 citizens planning to visit @entity4 , updating one that had been issued june 15			1
" @entity5 citizens are urged to exercise heightened security awareness and maintain a low profile , " it said			2
@entity116 called for the appointment of an investigative commission to probe whether the ruling @entity141 may have tried to " prevent and frustrate the extradition request			0
" @entity4 deserve to " understand the activities that took place , and the apparent conduct of members of government on the political and the administrative side , " @entity116 said			0
" we need to know if there was an attempt to obstruct justice on behalf of the government			0
" newspaper polls suggest most @entity4 believe the government mishandled the extradition request , he said			0
" there are still questions left to be answered , " he said			0
" we need a commission to look at all dimensions of this			0
" @entity21 has maintained a heroic reputation in the @entity37 slums , with some people comparing him to @entity166 , @entity167 and one - time @entity169 kingpin @entity168			1
his popularity stemmed from his community efforts , including handing out food , sending children to school and building medical centers			0
but drug enforcement officials say he deserves to be classified as one of the world 's most dangerous drug lords			0
@entity2 's @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 and journalist @entity186 contributed to this story .			0
