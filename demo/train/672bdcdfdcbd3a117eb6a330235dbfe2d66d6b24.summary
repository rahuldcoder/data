-- i strongly support @entity3 's impassioned efforts to expand everyone 's access to physician - assisted suicide			1
it is tragic that she died so young , but her life has made an important contribution to us all			2
i am an adamant opponent of physicians ever becoming agents of death			0
the lessons of the @entity15 , which began with a euthanasia program , are that once medical professionals become accustomed to administering death , we have created a frightening corps of people whose very " medical " prestige facilitates mass killing of the vulnerable			0
hence i oppose physician involvement in capital punishment ( via lethal injection ) and all forms of euthanasia in which physicians are actively involved			0
but physicians are not actively involved in physician - assisted suicide			1
in jurisdictions where physician - assisted suicide is permitted and where proper safeguards are in place to prevent depressed or otherwise ineligible people from access to lethal drugs , physicians play a standard medical role of ascertaining applicants ' eligibility for the appropriate medications			1
then the physicians get out of the way			0
it may seem strange to say this , but the reason that you and i as free individuals can not access life - ending drugs is because governments have imposed rules that require prescription approval by physicians for such drugs			1
hence , it is governments , and doctors acting on their behalf , who normally -- and wisely -- block our access to dangerous medications			0
@entity64 's mourners grieve on social media where physician - assisted suicide is allowed , physicians withdraw from this role -- they stop blocking our free access to the drugs we need to end our life			1
they are not administering death by writing a prescription			0
just the opposite , they get out of our way as free people and allow us to do what we want to do			0
physicians cease their active blocking role and literally do nothing			0
we are the ones who act to end our lives			2
i feel this is appropriate			0
in addition , i believe that people who are facing the end of life -- terminally ill patients such as @entity64 -- and those suffering grievous and irreversible pain should be free to end their life			2
this is a simple expression of respect for human freedom , autonomy and dignity , and it is also an expression of compassion to allow them to do it			1
experience with physician - assisted suicide has shown that many people who go through the process of applying for it do not finally avail themselves of the right to do so			1
this tells us that physician - assisted suicide plays an important role in providing comfort and assurance that one will not be forced to suffer beyond what one can bear			1
there are many who , on religious or other grounds , oppose suicide in any form			0
i respect their beliefs , and i would defend their right to refuse to end their lives by their own hand			2
but mutual respect here also requires that we allow others who believe differently to end their lives in the way they see fit , as @entity3 has now courageously done .			1

@entity3 , *29* , who had cancer , ended her life under @entity132 's @entity131
@entity134 supports efforts to expand access to physician - assisted suicide
he says it 's an expression of respect for human freedom , autonomy and dignity
green : why not allow people who believe differently to end their lives in way they see fit ?
