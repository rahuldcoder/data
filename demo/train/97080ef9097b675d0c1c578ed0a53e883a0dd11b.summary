-- @entity1 has been lured out of retirement once before and if anything is going to encourage the former world no. 1 out for a third stint on tour it 's the thought of playing at the @entity8			1
speaking with world no. 14 @entity11 on @entity0 's @entity12 , the 30 - year - old @entity9 admitted to a few pangs of jealousy as her @entity16 friend prepared to jet off to @entity18 for the year 's first grand slam			1
" yeah i 'm a little bit jealous when you told me that you 're leaving tomorrow , " said @entity1 , who won the last of her four grand slam titles at @entity18 in 2011			1

" the @entity1 , who retired for the second time in 2012 , wo n't be the only @entity34 pining for a bit of summer sun to soothe the winter blues			1
but while most visitors would flock to the beach or lounge around a pool , it 's clear that the former world no. 1 still misses the more active outdoor life that @entity31 life affords			1
" the first morning when you wake up with a huge jet lag , four , five o'clock in the morning and everybody is running or swimming , you can go outside and they are on their bikes and that 's what i love , " she says			0
" i think if i would do that here in @entity9 people would think i 'm going crazy			2
then again , the weather is not suited to living that kind of life style			0
" however , the mother of two -- @entity1 has a five - year - old daughter , @entity62 and gave birth to a son , @entity65 last september -- is n't about to make a comeback like she did in 2009			1
" i do n't miss the competition			0
i do n't miss the heavy work out schedule			0
it was getting harder with @entity62 to combine it and now with @entity65			0
i enjoy working out still but i enjoy doing it when i feel like doing it			0
" living an active life is a habit @entity1 is keen to pass on to her children , but she 's not about to become another one of tennis ' pushy parents			2
" i 'm not the kind of person where i want ( @entity62 ) to be like me and want her to have a career like me , " @entity1 told @entity0 in december 2012			1
" she plays a bit , she 's at the club that i own with a friend every wednesday , she goes there just for the social side of things ... " it 's just fun to see her have a social life and be among friends while playing sports			0
whether it 's swimming , track and field or tennis , i 'll support her whatever she wants to do			2
" but i 'm not going to be the mother that 's like , ' we 're going to play tennis , we 're going to practice this and this shot ' -- i 'm not like that at all			2
