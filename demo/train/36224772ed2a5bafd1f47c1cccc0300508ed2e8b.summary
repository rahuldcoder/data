@entity0 -- @entity8 's " the @entity7 " encouraged amateur " symbologists " everywhere to scan their favorite paintings for secret codes -- but the practice has been going on for centuries			1
from the inscrutable prehistoric cave drawings inside the @entity12 in @entity13 to the abstract paintings of @entity15 , artists have kept the intentions and significance of their work close to their chests			2
famously opaque paintings include @entity22 's 1545 work " an allegory with @entity26 and @entity27 , " which contains allegorical figures even scholars are n't able to decipher			2
still , historians often discover hidden images , symbols and texts in works of art. @entity34 selects examples of such discoveries -- some reputable , others outlandish			1
' @entity38 of @entity39 , ' @entity40 the latest example is the discovery of a profile of the devil , secreted in this fresco by thirteenth - century @entity46 artist @entity40 at the @entity47 in @entity48			1
@entity46 art historian @entity49 discovered the hook - nosed , smirking devil hidden in the swirls of a cloud			1
she believes it refers to the @entity55 belief that devils would appear in the clouds to arrest the soul 's ascent into heaven			0
' @entity61 , ' @entity62 @entity62 's painting of an enigmatic smiling woman has been a source of intrigue for years			2
in 2010 the president of @entity46 's @entity68 , @entity69 , was convinced he had discovered letters and numbers embedded in the eyes of the portrait , which he found after digitally magnifying it			1
initially , @entity69 's discovery of the letters l and @entity78 was taken as proof of the well - worn theory that the " @entity61 " is in fact a portrait of @entity62 himself			2
@entity69 then arrived at the conclusion that it was a painting of one of @entity62 's male associates , though other art historians have been quick to debunk the idea			1
' @entity89 , ' @entity90 this fresco in the @entity92 in @entity94 's @entity93 is believed to hold the key to a long - lost work by @entity62			1
art diagnostic expert @entity97 is convinced that @entity62 's fresco " @entity98 " lies behind " @entity99			1
" writer and painter @entity90 , a great admirer of @entity62 's , wrote about him beginning work on the fresco but abandoning it part of the way through due to technical problems			2
on a tiny painted green flag in @entity90 's fresco are the words " @entity111 , trova " -- in @entity113 , " seek and you shall find			0
" @entity97 is hoping to use forensic techniques to get behind @entity90 's fresco and see whether " @entity98 " really does lie behind it			0
' @entity117 , ' @entity118 @entity118 's sublime @entity117 at the @entity119 in @entity120 received a thorough restoration and cleaning towards the end of the twentieth century , revealing this @entity125 masterwork in all its colorful , complex glory			0
but according to @entity127 , co-author of the book " @entity129 : @entity118 's @entity131 in the @entity132 of the @entity119 , " the restoration also revealed some seditious and previously unnoticed communications			0
one discovery was of a painting of a young @entity136 man , @entity137 , wearing the sign of persecution prevalent at the time in @entity46 on his clothing , and apparently making a rude hand - gesture directly over where the @entity144 's throne would have been			0
another discovery was of two jews in the inner circle of the elect in the towering " @entity149 " -- " total blasphemy for the 1500s , " according to @entity127			0
it is his belief that @entity118 was secretly preaching ideas of acceptance during a time of religious intolerance			0
' @entity159 , ' @entity62 one of the more outlandish theories about this work ( which featured as the central clue in the plot of " the @entity7 " ) is that the undulating composition of the disciples ' hands and the bread rolls on the table correspond to musical notes on a stave			1
strung together , the tune supposedly resembles a requiem -- a song for the dead			0
@entity62 was a talented musician in addition to his other great talents ; perhaps a musical painting is n't entirely out of the question ? ' @entity178 , ' @entity179 @entity179 's 1601 painting " @entity178 " may not have a hidden message that we know of but it does contains subtle symbols hinting at the identity of the mysterious , beardless man at the table			1
an important clue is the shadow of a fishtail coming off the bowl of fruit magically hovering at the edge of the table , a just - visible sign that the man at the table is @entity196 , the fisher of men			0
another is the way all lines , like those in " @entity159 , " point to the beardless man at the head of the table -- @entity196 , in disguise .			0

symbols and hidden messages often discovered in historical paintings -- some *credible* , others less so
face of the devil recently discovered in a @entity215 in a *church* in @entity46
art historians believe they have found messages in works by @entity62 and @entity118
