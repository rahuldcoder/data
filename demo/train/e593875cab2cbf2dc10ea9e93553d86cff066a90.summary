the defense official said tuesday that the military is planning to send three @entity126 brigades , totaling about 15,000 troops ; a @entity88 brigade with about 8,000 troops ; a headquarters element of about 7,000 ; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of about 34,000 troops			1
@entity1 reported last month that this was the @entity64 's preferred option			0
however , the official said wednesday that the @entity88 are expected to deploy 8,000 combat , aviation and support troops , plus 1,000 to 1,500 @entity88 as part of a headquarters unit -- a total of between 9,000 and 9,500			1
they will be in addition to the 11,000 @entity88 already in @entity5			1
after the first deployment , the remaining @entity88 will deploy over the next three to four months , the military official said			1
the troops would be dispatched throughout @entity5 but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces , where much of the recent fighting has taken place			2
currently , brigades from @entity151 in @entity152 and @entity153 in @entity154 are among those next in line to deploy			0
about 68,000 @entity4 troops are in @entity5 , along with about 45,000 from the @entity159 alliance			1
two @entity4 military officials have told @entity1 that @entity159 countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the @entity64 expects @entity2 to send and the 40,000 @entity55 wants			1

another senior military official said @entity55 will take his orders from @entity2 and will do the best he can with what he has			2
the question , he said , is not the number of troops , but is whether the @entity4 has " the right resources to do what we need to do			2

" we have to gain the trust of the people , and that is a major part of the plan here			0
