-- some cried and others cheered in emotional scenes as pro-democracy campaigner @entity4 addressed thousands of @entity6 migrants wednesday on the outskirts of the @entity9 capital @entity10			1
it 's the first time the @entity6 opposition leader has been outside the country , also known as @entity6 , in more than two decades after a long period of detention by the ruling military junta			1
@entity6 migrant workers dream of return home several thousand people gathered to hear her speak , many of whom had spent years living in exile to escape poverty and the country 's oppressive regime			1
from a balcony high above the crowd , @entity4 said that the onus was on the government of @entity6 and @entity6 people everywhere to build a new country to encourage their return			1
" everybody has a responsibility			0
they too [ @entity6 workers ] have a responsibility and we too have a responsibility to create the kind of country to which all our people can return , whenever they wish too			2
" the peaceful freedom fighter @entity4 addressed the inequalities experienced by @entity6 migrants in @entity9 , who rights workers say are treated as cheap labor and second class citizens			1
" the laws of this land which do provide protection for workers are not always observed by everybody concerned			0
this is due to two things , " @entity4 said			2
" one , of course , we need to educate our workers as to their rights , by what kind of legal means there are for defending their rights because whatever we negotiate with our host government we want to do it in a harmonious way			0
of course we will also be asking for help and support from the local authorities , " she said			0
onlookers waved flags and photos of the pro-democracy campaigner and her father general @entity4 , a revolutionary who was assassinated six months before @entity6 's independence from @entity75 rule			2
some climbed onto rooftops for clearer view of @entity4 , whose @entity79 of @entity80 won a number of seats in @entity83 in april in the country 's first free and fair vote in decades			2
before her arrival , @entity6 migrants spoke of their desire for jobs within the country which has been ruled by a military junta since a bloodless coup in 1962			1
" i want to hear good news from her			0
i want to hear about the independence of @entity6 and democracy and that there are jobs available , " said @entity94 , a @entity6 migrant from @entity96 who has been living in @entity9 for three years			1
another , @entity101 , a vendor who has lived in @entity9 with his wife and three children for 12 years , told @entity0 : " i love @entity4			1
this is a very happy moment			0
i want her to say we can come home and have jobs			0
" " it is tough living in @entity9			0
we get a lot of pressure from @entity9 police and passport control , " he added			0
within the last two years , @entity6 's leadership has eased repressive controls on the country , allowing opposition parties to take part in the most recent elections			2
@entity4 's visit to @entity10 comes ahead of a longer trip to @entity126 next month during which she will make a series of key addresses , including the acceptance speech for the @entity130 that she was prevented from collecting in 1991 because she was in detention			1
