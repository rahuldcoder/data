@entity1 , @entity0 -- a high - pitched device used to combat anti-social behavior among young people has been called " unfair " by children 's campaigners in @entity0			1
" @entity10 " has been used to combat anti-social behavior among young people across @entity0 the @entity11 , who oversees children 's rights , has called for a ban on the ultra-sonic gadget , known as " @entity10 , " which disperses young people by emitting sharp , piercing sounds			1
the device causes discomfort to younger ears by exploiting their ability to hear very high frequencies -- a power which declines once they reach their 20s			2
but human rights groups say the machine infringes civil rights and creates a divide between young and old			1
launching the " @entity33 " campaign , @entity0 's @entity31 said : " i have spoken to many children and young people from all over @entity0 who have been deeply affected by ultra-sonic teenage deterrents			1
" @entity38 said about 3,500 of the devices are in use across @entity0 to split up gatherings of youth in areas such as parks and shops			1
" these devices are indiscriminate and target all children and young people , including babies , regardless of whether they are behaving or misbehaving , " he added			1
youth leaders backed the campaign , adding that @entity10 fails to address the root problems of anti-social behavior among youths -- and may even push teenagers to congregate in unsafe areas			2
" police , local authorities , and business instead should work collectively with young people and their communities to address the underlying causes of anti-social behavior in areas that cause concern , " said @entity57 , chief executive of the @entity58 , a government - funded group that works with young people on social development			1
the @entity10 was invented by @entity71 , from @entity72 , south @entity73 , and is manufactured by @entity74			2
the company describes @entity10 as an " ultrasonic teenage deterrent " and " the most effective tool in our fight against anti social behavior			0
" it says the device has a range of 15 to 20 meters and teenagers are " acutely aware of @entity10 and usually move away from an area within an average of 8 to 10 minutes			2
" the company says @entity10 has proved popular with shop keepers who buy it to move along gatherings of teenagers and anti-social youths			0
it could not be contacted for a response to criticism of the deterrent			0
@entity96 companies have also placed the device to discourage youths from spraying graffiti on trains and station walls , @entity74 said			0
the controversial gadget was first used by shopkeeper @entity103 , from @entity104			0
he told the @entity106 newspaper : " @entity108 someone has come along and wiped them off the face of the earth , or it 's working			0
" however , @entity112 , director of the human rights group @entity113 , said : " what type of society uses a low - level sonic weapon on its children ? imagine the outcry if a device was introduced that caused blanket discomfort to people of one race or gender , rather than to our kids			1
" @entity10 has no place in a country that values its children and seeks to instill them with dignity and respect			0
