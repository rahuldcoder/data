" a sophomore at @entity25 , where he was well - liked and respected , @entity11 loved art , music and sports , especially basketball			2

" suspect detained in @entity10 @entity37 , 17 @entity37 used to miss class often			1

the school district described him as " always happy , smiling , funny , kindhearted , sweet and polite , " the type pf person " who would do anything for anyone ( and ) was loved by all who knew him			1
