@entity0 -- members of the military may get expedited treatment at airport security checkpoints under a law signed tuesday by president @entity7			1
the law , authored by rep. @entity9 , @entity10 , requires the @entity11 to study ways to speed up screening of service members and , to the extent possible , their families , when the service members are in uniform and traveling on orders			1
@entity9 , a 24 - year @entity20 veteran and former @entity22 pilot , was inspired to introduce the bill after witnessing a soldier remove his boots while going through security at the @entity29 - @entity28 airport			0
" it seemed way too excessive for someone who was obviously a patriot serving his country , " said the congressman 's spokesman , @entity30			0
the new law was signed just days after two incidents involving the same soldier at airports in @entity40 and @entity41			2
according to court records , @entity42 , a 30 - year - old @entity44 @entity43 , had a military smoke grenade in his bag when he was leaving @entity48 , @entity40 , on @entity49 headed for @entity41			2
he was allowed to continue on his trip			0
on saturday , he was arrested at @entity51 in @entity41 on his return trip when @entity11 screeners found an undisclosed amount of @entity56 explosives in his bag			0
authorities said @entity42 did not have a detonator and initiator , that it would not have been possible to detonate the explosives , and that it did not appear he was up to anything nefarious			0
it was not immediately clear how any checkpoint changes would impact cases like @entity42 's			0
bars said the new law is intended to expedite screening , but not reduce security			0
currently , the @entity11 expedites screening for trusted travelers by dedicating a special line for them , and by allowing them to keep their shoes on and keep laptops in their carry - on bags			1
the new law says the @entity11 should establish guidelines for screening travelers in military uniforms and combat boots , and consider incorporating military personnel into trusted traveler programs that give preference to passengers who undergo pre-screening			1
nothing in the law prohibits additional screening of the service member if intelligence or law enforcement information indicates that additional screening is necessary			0
in november , @entity11 administrator @entity88 told @entity1 that he was already working on ways to expedite screening for service members			1
the @entity11 was starting to tests its ability to scan military id cards , known as " @entity96 , " at a regional airport in @entity98 , @entity99			2
@entity88 said the @entity11 test would not immediately result in quicker screening for service members			2
but if tests are successful , " we hope to expand that to airports that would have a large number of military personnel traveling through them , " he said			1
supporters of the initiative said that by expediting the screening of military personnel , the @entity11 will have more time to focus on unknown travelers who could present a higher risk			1
