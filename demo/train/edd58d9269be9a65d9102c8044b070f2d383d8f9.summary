-- there may be no bigger revolutionary rock star than @entity3			1
so it only makes sense that the 67 - year - old @entity7 democracy activist and @entity9 winner would tour the @entity10 in a way reflecting that			1
on tuesday , @entity3 was photographed laughing with @entity10 secretary of state @entity13			1
the two sat on couches next to each other at the @entity17 in @entity19 's private office and chatted			2
@entity19 told @entity3 about the bucolic scenes she could expect to see when she went to southern part of the @entity10 " you 're going out to one of the horse farms			1
they 're called bluegrass the way it looks across the field , " @entity19 said to a smiling @entity3			1
" you 'll find that quite beautiful			0
" that scene , historic and high profile , was just @entity33 of the next 17 days on @entity3 's calendar on her first visit to @entity10			1
she 's slated to talk with high - level @entity37 officials and democracy activists in the capital			1
the @entity40 said she will meet with president @entity41 at 5 p.m. wednesday , a day she 's already expected to receive the @entity42			0
then it 's on to @entity44 to speak at a university and at a museum			0
next week , she 'll be a guest of the @entity10 sen. @entity47 in @entity48 and visit @entity49			1
it 's a lot of travel for a person who spent most of the past 20 years under house arrest imposed by her country 's ruling military junta			0
during her confinement , she lost her husband to cancer -- unable to see him because he was forbidden from entering @entity7 to be with her			1
she also went without seeing her two sons			0
@entity3 was released from detention in november 2010 and this year was finally able to pick up the @entity9 she won in 1991 but could n't receive in person			1
profile : @entity3 , peaceful freedom fighter @entity3 is expected to meet with refugees who left @entity7 ( also known as @entity7 ) and relocated in the @entity10 , many who fought for the same democratic freedoms that she paid for so dearly			1
" we have this plan throughout the country that when refugees come we try and find sponsors , " @entity19 told @entity3 on tuesday			1
" i 'm looking forward to visiting @entity69 , " @entity3 replied			1
" there 's all sorts of interesting things happening in @entity69			0
" as part of @entity3 's @entity10 tour , she will visit the @entity76 city , home to one the @entity10 ' largest populations of @entity7 expatriots			1
since the early 1990s , some 5,000 @entity7 have carved out a life in its " @entity81			1
" and many there are expecting a lot from @entity3			1
" we are excited for @entity3 in @entity69 , but we also hope that it is more that a single visit			1
we want it to mean more			0
she symbolizes experience for us and @entity7 in the long term , " said @entity88 , the executive director of the @entity89 in @entity69 , which helps refugees find jobs and navigate everyday life			1
" the young people here want to be part of the @entity7 of tomorrow			1
this tomorrow is one that is open and free , " said @entity88			0
" we know that more has to happen outside of her			0
" @entity88 fled @entity7 in the 1990s , she said			1
she and many of the @entity7 who she works avidly follow world events			2
" we always keep up on what is happening , and we are very aware of what has happened in the past few years about @entity3 , " she said			2
thawing @entity10 - @entity7 relations last year , @entity19 met with @entity3 in @entity106 , the @entity7 capital			1
the two were photographed embracing , even though such signs of affection are not normally acceptable in the nation			0
the meeting was a sign that relations between @entity7 and the @entity10 were softening			1
it had been icy for some time			0
@entity19 was the first secretary of state to visit @entity7 in 50 years			1
in january , @entity3 announced she was running for @entity115			2
she won in a landslide in april			0
@entity3 is now the leading the pro-democracy opposition in her country			2
@entity7 's president , @entity119 , who took control in april 2011 , will visit the @entity10 next week to attend the @entity122 's annual gathering of world leaders in @entity44			1
this week at least 58 political detainees were among hundreds released in @entity7 as part of an amnesty announced on monday , a prisoner rights group said			2
earlier this summer , the country removed @entity3 's two sons ' names from a blacklist			2
on the world scene , @entity3 is both a politician and a symbol of promise , said @entity137 , a filmmaker who interviewed @entity3 in @entity7 and had spent a lot of time in the country			1
his film " they call it @entity7 " will be shown in @entity44 and @entity142 and other cities , including @entity69 on september 23			2
see a nationwide screening schedule " it 's important to keep in mind what 's motivating @entity119			0
he wants an easing of sanctions against his country , " said @entity137			0
" ( @entity3 ) is walking a tightrope			2
" he said @entity3 now must concede as much as any politician to get something accomplished , but she must also stand firm in her beliefs , the ideals that kept her sane and focused during her years in detention and have elevated her as a moral leader to much of the world			2
in july , the @entity41 administration began allowing @entity10 companies to invest in @entity7			1
several lawmakers have voiced their support for a relaxation of sanctions			0
in may , @entity168 sen. @entity168 said @entity37 should temporarily lift economic sanctions but keep in place an arms embargo against the @entity7 military and those who have violated human rights , according to @entity175			1
next generation 's obstacles @entity137 cautioned against what he views as overly optimistic headlines lauding @entity3 's @entity10 visit as a harbinger of immediate change on the ground in @entity7			1
he said that kind of change can not come solely from the president or @entity3			1
it 's important to keep in mind that the military still has a tremendous amount of control , at least according to the nation 's constitution			0
it still guarantees the military 25 percent of the legislature , he pointed out			0
" @entity3 is stunning , strong , articulate , mesmerizing			2
but she is also 67			0
she 'll be 70 when the next national election comes around in 2015 , " he said			0
" so that 's a factor as well			0
i think it will come down to whether a younger generation will get behind what she stands for , and will they be able to follow through			0
" and in that , he said , there 's perhaps another obstacle			0
@entity137 wonders if young people -- especially those in her own party -- will challenge @entity3 honestly and directly when they disagree with her			2
" there 's something called ' anade ' in @entity7 there which means you respect your elders , you do n't give them a bad message , " he said			2
" i asked her , ' how do you get information ? ' and she said , ' everybody knows they can tell me what they want and they wo n't get ( fired )			0
' " she probably believes that , " he said			0
" but i just doubt it because there 's such love for her , i do n't see someone questioning her			0
" @entity88 , in @entity69 , said she hopes they will			0
" we have to be able to say what we think			0
the people have high expectations , " she said			0
if @entity88 has a few moments with @entity3 , she will use the opportunity not to demand anything , though			2
" we know she is only one person , " she said			0
" i would tell her that we are with her , no matter what			0
