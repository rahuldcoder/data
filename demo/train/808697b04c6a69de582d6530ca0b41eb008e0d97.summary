@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 's wife has told interrogators she did n't venture outside the walled compound where the @entity9 leader was killed for five years , a @entity1 military spokesman said thursday			1
the wife , who was wounded in the raid , said she lived in the compound in @entity14 with eight of @entity5 's children and five others from another family , maj. gen. @entity10 told @entity2			1
all of them have been in @entity1 custody since the pre-dawn @entity21 commando raid monday that killed @entity5 and they will eventually be returned to their country of origin , @entity10 said			1
the many wives of @entity5 the news came as @entity1 's armed forces acknowledged intelligence " shortcomings " after the world 's most - wanted man was hunted down and killed in a city north of their capital			1
a military statement said an investigation would be launched , but warned that the @entity21 raid that killed @entity5 has jeopardized its cooperation with @entity21 forces			1
@entity10 said he was n't sure from the wife 's questioning how long @entity5 had lived in the compound or whether he had ventured outside during the five - year period his wife described			2
he identified the wife as " @entity46 , " but said he could not confirm her full name			0
@entity48 , 29 - years - old and originally from @entity49 , is the youngest of @entity5 's five wives			1
the @entity9 leader had a total of 20 children , and one of his adult sons was also reported killed in the weekend assault			0
with a $ 25 million @entity21 bounty on his head , @entity5 turned out to have been living in a three - story home in the @entity1 town of @entity14 -- about 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) from @entity0 and a short distance from a leading @entity1 military academy			1
@entity21 critics have questioned how @entity1 officials could have missed the compound , and @entity21 officials have said @entity68 did not give @entity1 any notice of the assault because they feared the word would leak			2
material shows threats to railways , key cities @entity1 backed the @entity77 fundamentalist @entity75 in @entity78 before the @entity75 - allied @entity9 attacked @entity79 and @entity68 on september 11 , 2001			0
@entity21 officials have warned that some elements of @entity1 's powerful @entity81 remain supportive of extremists even as @entity1 battles its own @entity75 insurgency			2
in a statement from @entity1 's military headquarters , the country 's armed service chiefs defended the @entity81 's efforts in attacking @entity9 leaders , but said there had been " shortcomings in developing intelligence on the presence of @entity5 in @entity1			1
" the statement said an investigation will be launched " into the circumstances that led to this situation			0
" @entity98 : new attacks were being plotted but the army chief of staff , gen. @entity107 , " made it very clear that any similar action , violating the sovereignty of @entity1 , will warrant a review on the level of military / intelligence cooperation with the @entity21 , " the statement said			1
and @entity1 has ordered @entity21 military personnel on its territory drawn down to the " minimum essential " level in the wake of the assault that killed @entity5 deep within @entity1 early monday , the statement announced			1
the @entity21 military has had a small contingent of troops operating as trainers for @entity1 security forces for at least three years			1
three americans taking part in that mission were killed in a roadside bombing along the rugged border between @entity78 and @entity1 in february 2010			0
breaking down the key points of @entity5 raid @entity1 is also a key supply route for the @entity21 and @entity128 troops battling the @entity75 in @entity78 , with truck convoys often coming under attack near the border			2
but those runs are made by contractors , not @entity21 troops			0
@entity134 , the @entity21 special representative for @entity78 and @entity1 , had some " very blunt " conversations with @entity1 officials in the wake of the @entity5 raid , according to two senior @entity21 officials briefed on the talks			2
in meetings with @entity107 and lt. gen. @entity142 , the @entity81 's chief , @entity134 discussed the need for @entity1 to improve its cooperation on counterterrorism in the wake of the @entity5 operation , the officials said			2
but the officials said that there is still no evidence that points to the senior levels of the @entity1 military or the @entity81 knowing that @entity5 was hiding out in that compound			1
and @entity1 foreign secretary @entity154 told reporters thursday that any suggestion that the intelligence service or the government were covering for @entity5 " is absolutely wrong			2
" in fact , he said , the @entity81 alerted @entity21 intelligence agencies to the presence of @entity9 operatives in @entity14 as early as 2004			0
" it is easy to say that the @entity81 and elements in the government are in cahoots with @entity9 , " he said			0
" this is a false charge			0
it can not be validated , on any account			0
" @entity107 and @entity142 both warned that comments like the ones by cia director @entity172 -- who told @entity21 lawmakers in a closed - door session tuesday that @entity1 officials were either " involved or incompetent " in @entity5 's case -- were unhelpful			1
still , they said that they wanted to work through the problems between the @entity68 and @entity0 , the senior @entity21 officials said			0
two key senators defend @entity1 aid @entity154 , too , tried to temper any reports of a rift between @entity1 and the @entity21			0
he said there has been an " excellent exchange of views " between the two sides in recent days , a positive rapport he expects to continue even as @entity1 opens a " review " of how @entity5 was able to stay in @entity14 , deals with the ramifications of accusations it could have done more and addresses issues of its terroritorial sovereignty after @entity21 forces got into @entity1 undetected			2
" we have cooperated with the @entity21 in the past			0
we look forward to continuing this cooperation at all levels , " @entity154 said			0
" i think , basically , the @entity1 - @entity21 relations are moving in the right direction			1
" @entity2 's @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 's wife says she stayed inside his compound for five years
