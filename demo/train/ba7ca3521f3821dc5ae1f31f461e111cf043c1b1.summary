it 's been dubbed by some as the " auto intifada " -- the spate of attacks on @entity6 civilians in @entity7 by @entity8 driving vehicles			1
in two such incidents in recent weeks , four people , including a 3 - month - old , have been killed and many more injured			0
in both instances , the drivers were @entity8 from @entity7 , and their targets were lines at light rail stops			1
the incidents were quickly seized upon by @entity19 , the radical @entity8 group that controls @entity20 , which said : " @entity19 blesses the action			1
what is happening in @entity7 is pushing us to prepare for war			1
" they were also celebrated in social media with a variety of cartoons depicting car pedals in the form of guns and road signs showing pedestrians being run over			0
one cartoon depicted a car as the barrel of a gun with the caption : " revolt and resist , even with your car			0
" another showed a car in the colors of @entity45 hitting two men with @entity6 stars on their black hats			0
a third showed cars with sharks ' teeth prowling the streets			0
there also was a play on words in some of the cartoons -- with " daes , " meaning " run over " in @entity59 , similar to " @entity60 , " the @entity59 shorthand for the @entity62 in @entity63 and @entity64			0
facebook pages were inundated with messages such as : " from @entity45 we brought to the world the intifada of stones			0
now we bring the intifada of running over			0
" palestinians living in @entity7 who have licenses and an @entity74 id card can drive anywhere in the city and elsewhere in @entity74			1
' there is no @entity78 against drivers ' in some quarters , there has been a visceral reaction to the attacks			1
a former @entity7 police chief , @entity84 , told the newspaper @entity85 : " we are now paying the price for a lack of policy and decision - making			1
... the @entity6 residents of @entity7 are scared to death			2
this is reminiscent of the days of the suicide bombings			0
" economy minister @entity94 , who is leader of the @entity95 , warned : " there is no @entity78 against drivers , and @entity74 citizens can not live without deterrence and sovereignty in their capital city			1
" he criticized the installation of concrete barriers at light rail stops as too defensive			0
" the solution is deterrence , not defensive measures			0
the solution is not the @entity78 concept , but an iron fist , " @entity94 said on his @entity109 page			2
in reality , two random attacks hardly amount to an intifada , even if they derive from ( and fuel ) an already tense atmosphere in @entity7 over worship at the @entity119 , or , as it 's known to @entity120 , @entity119 , the @entity119			1
a weapon of despair far from being the weapon of choice , these crude vehicle attacks seem to be a weapon of despair , and they only serve to underline the absence of both political solutions and organized forms of resistance			2
the previous intifada , a word that means " shaking off " in @entity59 , had leadership , some measure of organization and mass support			0
the first , which began in 1987 , was soon harnessed by " @entity138			0
" the second , which began after then - @entity74 opposition leader @entity140 visited the @entity119 in september 2000 , was embraced and directed by the @entity141 and @entity142			2
around the turn of the century , @entity74 were terrorized by bus bombings , suicide attacks in shopping malls and restaurants			1
since then , the @entity74 construction of the @entity150 barrier has cut off access to @entity7 for most @entity8 living there ; and @entity74 security services have built up a formidable intelligence - gathering apparatus			1
nowadays , protests involve mainly teenage @entity8 connected by @entity156 and other social messaging who take to the streets -- usually in their dozens rather than hundreds -- to hurl rocks and firecrackers at @entity74 police			1
they respond to events , such as the kidnapping and killing of a @entity8 teenager in @entity7 last summer by three @entity74			1
there is no evidence these protesters have either leadership or structure -- rather , they 're driven by an anger born of being penned into cramped neighborhoods with few services and fewer prospects			0
@entity74 security forces contain that anger and make a few dozen arrests with relative ease			2
' a weary approach to violence ' the @entity184 rails against @entity74 policy in @entity7 , the expansion of @entity6 settlements and more , but it has shown no appetite for leading or coordinating such protests			1
" @entity150 elites are generally less vitriolic in their views , more @entity8 have vested economic interests to protect , and there is a weary approach to violence , " says @entity190 of @entity191			2
and @entity184 president @entity205 " would prefer to contain any risks of protests spreading to the @entity150 as he fears that @entity19 could take advantage of instability in this territory and further expand its foothold there , " @entity190 said			2
even so , the fate of the @entity119 or @entity119 is a highly emotive issue for both sides			0
last week , a @entity8 from @entity7 shot and critically wounded a rabbi , @entity209 , who campaigns for the right of @entity6 to pray at the @entity119			1
after an @entity74 counterterrorism unit shot and killed the assailant hours later , @entity205 wrote to his family saying he would " go to heaven as a martyr defending the rights of our people and its holy places			2
" on wednesday , @entity221 , a father of five from the @entity223 refugee camp , drove his van into a crowd of people at a light rail stop in @entity7 , authorities said			2
his widow told reporters he had been following media coverage of events at the holy site 's @entity232 " and saw the blood , the wounded , the desecration of the @entity238 ( the @entity239 ) and all that happened			0
" @entity74 prime minister @entity240 has promised to preserve the status quo at the @entity119 , whereby @entity6 can visit the site but under no circumstances pray there			0
but @entity8 see visits by @entity209 -- as well as deputy speaker of the @entity247 @entity246 and other @entity74 politicians -- as provocative and part of a campaign to establish a @entity6 place of worship in the complex			1
several @entity8 have been injured amid clashes with @entity74 police around the compound , mainly by rubber bullets and the effects of tear gas , but there have been no fatalities			1
@entity74 and the @entity184 wants to keep it that way , for fear that more serious clashes at such a sensitive site could spark a conflict much broader than the " auto intifada			0

@entity8 motorists have targeted civilians in @entity7
@entity74 official : ' there is no @entity78 against drivers '
@entity19 backs such *tactics*
attacks come amid little movement on peace solutions
