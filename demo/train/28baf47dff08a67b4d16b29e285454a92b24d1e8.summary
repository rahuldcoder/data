-- when studying up for a trip to the @entity3 , you might come across this warning : whatever you do , do n't take a bear to the beach			2
feeding pigeons is illegal in @entity8 , @entity9 , and could earn you a fine			1
@entity12 expect to experience some difference in laws when they travel the world , but some laws we found just sounded insane			1
in @entity19 , it 's illegal to name a pig @entity20			1
in @entity23 , single women ca n't parachute on sundays			2
and in @entity25 , you may urinate anywhere in public , including inside a policeman 's helmet , providing that you 're also pregnant			1
granted , most of us can rest easy on the plane ride to our destinations knowing that we wo n't run afoul of such rules			2
plus , many reported laws are just urban legends , and in other cases , anomalies on the books that no one has the time or interest to enforce			1
( " people here do n't keep bears ! " an exasperated @entity47 spokeswoman told us			2
" why would they take one to the beach ? " ) but other laws -- such as keeping your headlights on at all times while driving in @entity54 -- are in equal parts surprising and real			1
get caught , and the resulting fine could run about $ 100 ( and the entire @entity57 may adopt the law )			2
see a @entity0 slideshow of the world 's strangest laws while some laws seem ridiculous at first blush , they often carry their own logic			1
pigeon - feeding is not tolerated ( and fine - worthy ) in @entity8 , because the winged troublemakers -- and really , their droppings -- wreak havoc on the city 's old , vulnerable buildings			1
@entity73 is infamous for its tough laws against chewing gum and graffiti ( remember the 18 - year - old @entity12 who got caned in the 1990s ? )			1
in the @entity73 ' defense , the gum laws -- which have relaxed a bit -- were originally enacted to fight what authorities saw as rampant gum - wad littering			1
even so , do n't even think about leaving a public toilet un-flushed			2
it could cost you $ 100			2
what should you do if you do break a law , crazy or otherwise , while on vacation ? @entity89 is a @entity90 attorney who operates an international legal hotline , helping @entity12 travelers who have run afoul of the law in other countries			1
" it 's always best to try to get an attorney involved , " he says			1
ignoring the issue could result in problems if you make a return visit to that country			0
@entity89 says he commonly deals with college kids who have taken too many liberties with other countries ' lower drinking ages , or unsuspecting tourists who get arrested for trying to take home souvenirs ( such as old rugs ) that end up being antiquities			0
he says such problems raise the argument for buying travel insurance , or even buying travel assistance packages , which can offer legal help abroad			0
( to price varying packages , check out @entity117			0
) of course , most americans do n't bother with travel insurance			0
in that case , you can contact the @entity12 embassy or consulate for a list of local attorneys			0
or you can handle the problem on your own			0
@entity128 recently stayed at a @entity130 resort , and when he and his family rented a car , they were almost immediately stopped by police and accused of swerving dangerously on the road			0
( @entity128 says he was merely driving around fallen palm braches and coconuts following the previous day 's category 2 hurricane			1
) " they started to arrest me because they said all tickets were to be paid at the police station , " @entity128 says			0
but when he asked if he could pay the ticket on the spot , the cops agreed			0
@entity128 handed them a $ 100 bill and they let him go			0
he immediately returned the car			0
" total rental car time , 20 minutes			0
cost , $ 155 , " he said			0
" not spending a second in a @entity130 jail , priceless			0
" planning a beach getaway ? do n't miss @entity0 's guide to @entity153			1
