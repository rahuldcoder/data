-- few dinosaurs have as interesting a back story as the spinosaurus			2
in life , it dominated the waterways -- a 50 - foot - long behemoth that employed its blade - like claws and conical , razor - sharp teeth to annihilate its prey			2
it chomped down on sharks for breakfast			2
ninety - five million years after its extinction , this strangely aquatic dinosaur -- the only one of its kind that we know of -- has had to contend with @entity21 , bomb raids , armed gangs and mysterious moustachioed men			1
its story has all the makings of a spy novel			0
the most recent chapter in the spinosaurus ' long and very bizarre tale occurred last year when @entity31 , a @entity33 - @entity32 palaeontologist from the @entity34 , uncovered the most complete skeleton fossil of the species yet found in @entity32 's @entity37			1
it also happens to be the only remaining skeleton of the species , as all other physical evidence of the spinosaurus was obliterated 70 years ago			1
" it 's a really mysterious dinosaur			1
( until now ) , all we had was little bits and pieces , tantalizing clues and drawings of a partial skeleton that had been destroyed in @entity49 , " explains @entity31			1
early bones the first , and up until recently only , spinosaurus skeleton ever found was uncovered by a fossil collector working for @entity33 palaeontologist @entity53 -- then one of the world 's leading experts on the enigmatic dinosaurs of @entity57			1
for years , @entity53 unearthed a paleontological treasure trove in the @entity37			0
" @entity53 was really a very productive scientist			0
he was an explorer , and he was really the first person to resurrect the lost world of @entity57 's dinosaurs in a big way , " says @entity31			1
unfortunately , his luck turned with the onset of a war that would rob him of his sons -- two died in battle while the third barely survived a five - year imprisonment -- and his life 's work			2
most of his finds were stored at a palaeontology museum in @entity75			0
he begged the director to relocate the dinosaur collection , but was refused , and in april 1944 , an allied air raid destroyed the institution and @entity53 's findings			1
" everything went up in flames , and @entity53 lost all these incredible finds in a single night , " recalls @entity31 , who considers @entity53 his role model			1
" resurrecting the spinosaurus -- his most famous discovery -- was the best way to bring @entity53 back into the books of dinosaur palaeontology , " he says			1
the man with the mustache @entity31 's hunt for the spinosaurus began in 2008 when he met a moustachioed @entity32 fossil hunter who was proffering rare - looking samples from a cardboard box			1
" one piece looked really interesting			0
it was a blade - shaped piece of bone and i did think at the time that maybe this is a chunk of the spine of spinosaurus , " he recalls			2
years later , colleagues from the @entity104 in @entity105 showed him similar samples of what they , too , believed was a partial skeleton of a spinosaurus			1
we had leg bones and spines and ribs and skull bones			0
it was very exciting , but we had a big problem			0
we had no idea where the skeleton came from , ( which ) means we do n't know anything about the environment the animal lived in , the geological context , or if the bones were found in the same place , " he says			1
with a closer look , however , the bones looked familiar			0
@entity31 suspected they not only came from the same site as the specimen he was shown in @entity32 , but from the same dinosaur			1
what followed was a five - year hunt for the man with the mustache -- it was the only detail @entity31 remembered about the encounter			1
in 2013 , @entity31 called off the search while sipping mint tea with colleagues in a @entity32 cafe			1
" i think i was a little naive and very optimistic , and ... we thought , ok , we ca n't find the guy , so that 's the end of our mission impossible			2
just like in a bad @entity148 movie , the very moment when i was ready to throw in the towel , a man walked passed our table			0
the man had a mustache and it was the man i had been looking for			0
" after @entity31 caught up with him , the man took him back to where he first made the finds			1
further excavations dug up even more bones , most likely from the same animal			0
the collection painted the most complete picture to date of what the animal looked like and how it lived			2
mainly , @entity31 was able to ascertain that spinosaurus was an aquatic dinosaur ( a first ; previously , there was no known evidence of such a creature )			1
dense bones -- rare in dinosaurs but common in penguins -- provided the animal with buoyancy in rivers , while a crocodile - like snout helped it both to breathe and sense movement underwater			0
a seven - foot " sail " on the animal 's back helped it navigate through the seas			2
the findings were published in the journal @entity182 last month , are the cover story of this month 's issue of @entity185 , and are also currently the subject of an exhibit at the @entity188 in @entity189			2
the @entity37 : land of giants the @entity37 of today can be pretty inhospitable			0
the land is vast and remote , and offers few visual clues			0
temperatures rarely dip below @entity195 , and high winds make for some ferocious sandstorms			0
the sand is also riddled with booby traps : @entity200 , snakes and landmines -- not to mention the odd armed militia doing the rounds -- which tend to keep most palaeontologists at bay			0
@entity31 , however , is addicted to the landscape			1
" the @entity37 is a magical place			0
you 'll find fossils of giant fish and river turtles and crocodile - like predators , and that 's when it hits you : this place was very , very different 95 million years ago			2
it was a bizarre world , really like a different planet , " he says			0
in place of the current , seemingly endless expanse of sand , there was a river system that housed all manner of strange creatures			0
" i call it ' the river of giants			0
' ( there were ) giant sawfish and lungfish , flying reptiles -- some with wingspans of six or seven meters -- and lots of predatory dinosaurs			0
" it 's a place @entity31 is eager to revisit			1
" let 's just say this is n't the last time i travel to the @entity37 in search of lost worlds and bizarre creatures , " he says .			2

@entity31 found the most complete skeleton of spinosaurus
it 's the first known aquatic dinosaur
the only other skeleton was destroyed in a bomb raid
it 's bigger than @entity255
