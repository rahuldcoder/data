-- coaching the @entity2 national team is proving to be a difficult assignment			0
when @entity5 parted company with @entity7 and replaced him with @entity8 on friday , it marked the third time in a month @entity5 changed their football manager			1
@entity7 did n't have much time to mold the side , as he was only brought in when interim boss @entity13 got the boot			2
@entity15 himself inherited the position after @entity18 received his marching orders earlier in september			0
@entity7 won his first game 2 - 1 against @entity21 , needing a late goal to earn all three points , but lost his second 2 - 1 at @entity24			1
@entity5 , a proud footballing nation that has appeared in the last five @entity25 , won men 's @entity27 gold in 2012 by topping @entity30 's @entity29 and captured the under - 17 @entity31 in 2011 , only scraped into a @entity31 playoff when fiercest rival the @entity33 scored two goals in injury time to beat the @entity21 3 - 2 on the road			1
had @entity21 hung on for the victory , it , not @entity5 , would have faced @entity40 next month in the two - leg shootout to reach @entity29			1
@entity7 , who has 25 years of coaching experience , likely did n't help his cause ahead of the game against @entity24 when he labeled his team " arrogant			2
" " in our game , sometimes we exaggerate , we become arrogant , " he told reporters			0
" i think this is the moment that we should reflect and show , above all , on the pitch that we need to win			0
" @entity7 revealed thursday that he had been axed , with @entity5 's football federation officially announcing the coaching shuffle friday			1
@entity5 's struggles in qualifying came as the @entity33 topped the group , @entity24 finished second and @entity58 claimed the third and final automatic @entity31 spot			1
while @entity5 reached the second round in @entity61 three years ago , @entity58 was last in its group and @entity24 did n't qualify for the tournament			0
on paper @entity8 , a former defender for the national team , should lead @entity5 to @entity29 since @entity40 is ranked 79th by @entity66 and @entity5 stands 24th but the recent disarray wo n't hurt the @entity69 ' chances of playing at a second straight @entity31			1
@entity8 guided @entity70 to the @entity2 @entity72 title in may			0
@entity7 not the only manager to go @entity7 has n't been the only manager to lose his job despite his team making the playoffs -- @entity78 fired former national team defender @entity79 after a 2 - 1 loss at @entity82			2
he was replaced by @entity83 , the former hard - nosed captain of @entity78			0
@entity84 sacked @entity85 following back - to - back 6 - 0 defeats against @entity29 and @entity87 despite the @entity84 being one of the first nations to book a spot in @entity29 .			0
