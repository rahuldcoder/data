@entity0 -- @entity3 counter-terror police launched pre-dawn raids against scores of targets across @entity3 's largest city tuesday			1
at least 30 suspects were detained , @entity3 's semi-official @entity9 reported , in connection with anti-government protests that erupted in @entity0 in late may			1
what 's driving unrest and protests in @entity3 ? the @entity3 @entity16 , the @entity0 governor 's office and @entity0 police declined to comment on the raids when contacted by @entity1			1
but relatives and friends of some of those detained described the police raids while waiting outside @entity0 's main police headquarters for news about their loved ones			1
" ten to 13 of them ( police officers ) came around 5 a.m. , " said @entity27 , a student at @entity28 who said his 20 - year old roommate , @entity29 , was detained tuesday morning			1
" they took four computers , our notebooks and some cameras , " @entity27 added			0
@entity37 told @entity1 police raided her family 's home and detained her 19 - year old brother @entity41 at 5 a.m. " they showed a picture of my brother and the search warrant to my father , " @entity37 said			0
she said her brother had recently completed high school and taken a university entrance exam			0
" as a family we were all there at the gezi events			0
we support the movement ... they think that they can scare us from going out into the street but they ca n't , " @entity37 said			0
she was referring to an unprecedented series of protests that erupted after @entity3 riot police repeatedly attacked a peaceful sit - in in @entity0 's @entity63 in may			1
demonstrators had initially organized a small @entity66 - style protest against government plans to bulldoze the park and replace it with a shopping mall			0
for several days , riot police repeatedly attacked sit - in participants with pepper spray , tear gas and water cannons			0
on may 30 , demonstrators began fighting back , erecting barricades and attacking security forces with stones , bottles and slingshots			0
the mass civil disobedience and rioting quickly spread to other cities and towns across the country			0
thousands of people were wounded in clashes , and at least one police officer and five demonstrators were killed			1
the most recent fatality was 19 - year - old @entity89 , who died at a hospital last week after being beaten into a coma during demonstrations in the city of @entity94 on june 2			1
@entity3 media organizations have released security camera footage from that night showing men with gas masks and clubs chasing protesters and beating them in the streets of @entity94			1
@entity3 prime minister @entity102 has repeatedly denounced the protests , calling demonstrators " terrorists " and " vandals			2
" initially , @entity102 accused the demonstrators of being part of an international conspiracy aimed at toppling his elected government			0
he claimed that protests in both @entity3 and @entity112 were organized by the same shadowy " center			2
" over the last week , @entity102 has expanded the scope of the alleged conspiracy , claiming that mass protests and a military coup that toppled the elected government in @entity119 were somehow linked to the demonstrations in @entity3			1
@entity3 security forces have largely succeeded in crushing the demonstrations through widespread use of tear gas , water cannons and a growing number of arrests			1
but in doing so , the @entity3 police and government have come under fire from international organizations like the @entity132 and @entity133 for " excessive use of force			2
" last week , a coalition of medical organizations including the @entity139 - based @entity138 and the @entity140 issued an appeal for an international ban on the sale of tear gas to @entity3			2
" police have systematically used tear gas as a weapon on hundreds of thousands of demonstrators , firing tear gas canisters and capsules directly at protesters at close range , " the medical groups wrote in an open letter addressed to @entity102			0
they also called upon the @entity3 government to " prohibit all attacks on medical personnel who provide emergency assistance to injured protestors			2
" @entity3 's challenge : find compromise before violence expands			0

at least 30 people were detained in the raids , a @entity3 news agency reported
relatives of those detained say the raids came early tuesday morning
