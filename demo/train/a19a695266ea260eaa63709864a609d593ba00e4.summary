-- he took on " the @entity2 , " overcame a plane - load of rogue reptiles and struck down his enemies with " great vengeance and furious anger			0
" however , @entity9 star @entity8 is more at home on the genteel fairways of a golf course			1
the actor , whose numerous film credits include @entity15 , the @entity17 prequels and , yes , @entity18 , is so dedicated to perfecting his game that he has a clause written into his contracts that allows him time off to play golf			1
" they have to let me play at least twice a week , " @entity8 told @entity0 's @entity23			1
" generally they either move me onto a golf course or i join a club so i can play there			2
" the 64 - year - old plays off a six - handicap and is a regular at celebrity pro-am tournaments , having lined up at famed courses such as @entity34 and @entity35			1
@entity8 has teed off alongside peers such as @entity37 and @entity38 , as well as saxophonist @entity39 -- the man he rates the best amateur golfer he has played against -- but his favorite round was with 14 - time major winner @entity43			1
" the first time i played @entity34 ( in @entity45 ) i actually played with @entity43 , " @entity8 said			1
" that 's kind of a big deal			0
" the first time i met him i played with him at the @entity49 ( @entity50 ) and i think his advice to me was ' follow me ' -- and i actually did			2
" i did n't hit the ball as far as he did but i kind of hit the same balls			0
" reluctant beginnings @entity8 was born in @entity56 and studied in @entity57 before moving to @entity58 to pursue an acting career			0
but it was in @entity61 , the city he has now made his home , where he first discovered golf -- although it took some cunning and persuasion for friends to pique his interest			0
" i had never played and they kept trying to get me to go out , and i would n't , " @entity8 recalled			2
" they tricked me one day and told me they were going somewhere else and we ended up on a golf course			0
" i did n't like the fact that they could do something that i could n't and i started playing -- now they do n't play with me ! " @entity8 told the @entity79 website that when he 's not working he plays golf every day , sometimes shooting 27 holes at a time			1
but , despite playing the game around the globe , there is one course that @entity8 rates as pretty special			0
" the best course in the world i 've played ? that would be @entity90 where they play the masters , " he explained			1
" when i was shooting @entity94 ( filmed in the state of @entity58 ) the producers gave me as my wrap gift three rounds of golf at @entity90			2
" golfing good deeds @entity8 's love of golf is now such an intrinsic part of his off - screen character that the profile on his @entity106 page shows him channeling movie star in a sharp black suit -- while he holds a putter behind his back			1
he also blends his celebrity status with his golf game to raise funds in his annual @entity115 charity fundraiser			1

" my mum passed from @entity126 's last year -- my grandfather had it , her sister 's got it , her brother had it , my paternal grandmother had it , so it seems like i 'm kind of surrounded by it , " @entity8 explained			2
" i may need the help of that organization at some point so i better raise some money for them ! " as henchman @entity140 in 1994 's breakthrough @entity15 performance , @entity8 memorably quoted the @entity143 as he sought " the path of the righteous man " -- and he also has advice for those seeking the perfect golf stroke			1
" the first thing is keep your head down , " he says			0
" that 's the hardest thing to do when you 're a beginner because you always want to see where the ball is going , so you always tend to look up before you swing			0
