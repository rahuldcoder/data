-- @entity1 revolutionizes city landscapes with distinctive and cutting - edge buildings			1
@entity5 's @entity4 is one of @entity1 ' recent builds			1
responsible for the iconic cctv headquarters in @entity8 the @entity10 architect was named one of " @entity13 's @entity12 " by @entity14			1
similar to the man himself , his buildings are not afraid to make a statement			1
" we felt it was very important for an entity like @entity7 to make its presence felt ... to generate a space and to define a space , that is the main thing , " he told @entity0 at the opening of his " @entity28 " building in @entity29 , @entity30			2
@entity1 admits that the current economic climate is not particularly favorable to big and bold architectural plans , but from adversity comes creativity			1
" definitely there were a number of projects that we worked on put on hold , but on the other hand certain things were also accelerated because the price of construction is getting so cheap			0
" despite these new parameters he remains optimistic that his profession will continue to invent and be relevant , " because it means kind of smaller , but more complex and kind of interesting things , kind of related to , not necessarily with commerce , but more connected to culture and to the social world			2
" his buildings have attracted worldwide fame and given @entity1 himself a form of semi-celebrity status			1
yet @entity1 still feels a sense of unease being labeled a " @entity61			1
" " i think it 's a name that is actually degrading to the vast majority of people it is applied to			2
and it really is a kind of political term that for certain clients is important because they use star architects			0
my hope is that through the current complexity that title will exit discretely and disappear , " he said			0
he believes that by being able to respond to different demands architecture is evolving into something new			0
" it is not possible to live in this age if you do n't have a sense of many contradictory forces , " he said			0
" each building has to be beautiful , but cheap and fast , but it lasts forever			0
that is already an incredible battery of seemingly contradictory demands			0
so yes , i 'm definitely perhaps contradictory person , but i operate in very contradictory times			0
