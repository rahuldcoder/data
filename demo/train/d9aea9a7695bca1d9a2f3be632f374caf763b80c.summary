-- the paintings in @entity3 's " the @entity2 , " which are currently on display at the @entity5 in @entity6 , have come under fire for their resemblance to widely available pre-existing photographs			1
the series of paintings , which are said to part of a " visual journal " made by the singer during his travels through @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , have been compared to famous photos by well - known photographers such as @entity22 and @entity23			1
" the most striking thing is that @entity3 has not merely used a photograph to inspire a painting : he has taken the photographer 's shot composition and copied it exactly , " wrote @entity3 critic @entity24 in a post on his blog , @entity26			1
" he 's replicated everything as closely as possible			0
that may be a ( very self - enriching ) game he 's playing with his followers , but it 's not a very imaginative approach to painting			1
it may not be plagiarism but it 's surely copying rather a lot			0
" while some fans in the @entity3 - centric online community " @entity46 " have voiced concern about the songwriter 's highly derivative visual art , others have argued that " quotation " is a part of the tradition of art. nevertheless , it 's a bit difficult to reconcile this notion with the fact that the work has been presented as coming from the rock legend 's " firsthand " experiences abroad			1
@entity3 has , in his way , been forthcoming about using photographs in his paintings			2
in a statement in the exhibition 's catalog , the singer says that he paints " mostly from real life			2
it has to start with that			0
real people , real street scenes , behind the curtain scenes , live models , paintings , photographs , staged setups , architecture , grids , graphic design			2
whatever it takes to make it work			0
