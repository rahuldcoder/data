@entity0 -- forget the red - hot property market of mainland @entity3 -- a new forecast says investors should be looking south			2
@entity6 -- @entity8 's burgeoning capital of nearly 10 million people -- is predicted to be @entity11 's top real estate market in 2013 , ahead of cities such as @entity0 , @entity13 and @entity14 in " @entity15 in @entity16 -- @entity11 2013 , " a real estate forecast released this week by @entity18 and the @entity20 - based @entity19			1
the recommendation to buy into @entity6 - based property may raise eyebrows , but @entity24 says @entity8 's economic turnaround over the past few years has impressed international investors			1
" interest rates and inflation are under control , and while @entity32 is growing at around 6.5 % annually , foreign direct investment is increasing at a much higher rateâ € ” 39 % in the first half of this year , " the survey said			2
" driven by increased demand from foreigners and locals alike , office rents shot up 29 % year - on - year in the third quarter , according to ( property services firm ) @entity40			0
" that growth in demand helped @entity6 jump 10 places from its 2011 ranking but @entity18 warns the city 's real estate scene is not entirely rosy			1
difficulties in finding inexpensive bank loans , trustworthy local partners and land with disputed ownership all mean " caveat emptor " -- buyer beware			0
@entity3 's financial hub of @entity55 keeps its number two spot from last year			0
the @entity18 survey says the city 's retail property sector is heating up as investors shift away from the commercial sector , traditionally " the bread - and - butter investment for foreign funds in @entity3 for many years			2
" but @entity18 adds that foreigners are generally not as tempted to buy into @entity55 property as they were in the past			0
the major reasons : a real estate market that is already saturated , the rarity of commercial - grade investment buildings and @entity3 regulators that are not as welcoming to foreign money as in years past			1
the tiny city - state of @entity13 , traditionally a safe bet for real estate plays , comes in a close third , falling from last year 's first place			1
@entity18 credits the @entity13 's strong position as an @entity80 financial hub , an uninterrupted supply of real estate projects and continued demand for high - grade office space as the country attracts more employees from multinational firms			1
put simply , both supply and demand for @entity13 property is expected to stay strong in 2013 , @entity18 reports			0
@entity11 's @entity91 for 2013 1			1
@entity3 -- secondary cities ( @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 ) 9			0
@entity111 , @entity3 at number 13 , the real estate outlook for @entity107 signifies a ratings downgrade from " generally good " prospects to " fair " prospects			2
@entity18 says the ranking for @entity108 's capital is surprisingly " lackluster			1
" " though investment potential appears good , investors have found deal flows restricted by the ongoing reluctance of local banks to clear bad debt from their balance sheets			0
a wide bid / ask spread has also limited transaction volumes			0
" the forecast 's lowest - ranked city for real estate investment in 2013 is @entity132 and ranks at the bottom in most survey categories , from investment and development prospects to office buy / sell recommendations			1
one major reason is a glut of new office space that is still being completed			0
at the same time , @entity18 says " in small regional cities such as @entity132 , investors simply do not know where the bottom is because of uncertain demand			0
" the silver lining is that @entity132 's four - year oversupply of office space is coming to an end , @entity18 says .			2

@entity8 's capital @entity6 is predicted to be @entity11 's top real estate market in 2013
with increasing *gdp* and foreign investment , @entity6 jumped up 10 places since 2011
@entity13 got bumped to third place , from first place last year
@entity108 's @entity132 is the forecast 's lowest - ranked city for real estate investment next year
