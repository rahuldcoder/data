@entity0 -- negative attacks are as @entity3 as apple pie			1
since the early days of the republic , candidates attacked with a vigor that contemporary strategists would admire			2
in the 1800 presidential election , for example , @entity9 and @entity10 criticized one another with a stunning ferocity on everything from foreign and domestic policy to private character and personal behavior			0
later campaigns were n't much better			0
critics of @entity21 in 1836 accused him of murdering @entity22			0
in 1884 , @entity23 was ridiculed for fathering an illegitimate child			0
@entity25 was characterized as a dangerous radical in 1896 who would ruin the economy			0
despite these historical precedents , the 2008 campaign has reached all - time lows in the use of misleading and inaccurate political appeals			1
even @entity33 , the architect of negative ads in previous campaigns , has complained about the tenor of this year 's campaign			1
@entity38 broadcast an ad taking @entity41 's words out of context and suggesting @entity43 were trying to compare @entity45 vice presidential nominee @entity44 to a pig			1
the @entity38 campaign ran another spot erroneously claiming @entity41 favored comprehensive sex education for kindergarteners			1
@entity43 have not been above reproach either			0
after @entity38 secured the @entity45 nomination this spring , outside groups falsely claimed the @entity45 supported a 1,000 - year war in @entity55 and therefore was not worthy of the presidency			1
these misleading appeals suggest voters must remain vigilant about candidate , party , and group claims			1
generally , the most misleading commercials have come from independent groups uncoordinated with the candidates			0
these organizations feel free to run emotional and inaccurate content designed to play on voter 's fears and anxieties			1
some of the worst ads in recent memory , such as the @entity73 ad in 1988 , have been broadcast by these kinds of groups			1
in past years , the only upside of attack ads was that they generally contained more issue content than other types of ads. since reporters police campaign appeals , the ads generally stick to the issues and rely on factually - accurate information			1
ad sponsors and candidates realize they will be held accountable for unfair ad content			0
however , commercials run this year represent a break with this general pattern			1
attack ads broadcast in recent months have twisted the truth , lied about personal background , taken statements out of context , and clearly sought to manipulate voter sentiments			1
most worrisome from a factual standpoint is @entity38 's claim that @entity41 will raise taxes on the middle class			1
although @entity41 has pledged to increase income taxes on those earning more than $ 250,000 , he has been careful not to make proposals that would raise taxes on the middle class for fear of being labeled a tax - and - spend liberal			1
@entity38 's tax claims have been condemned by leading editorial boards and surely will attract considerable attention in upcoming debates			1
with all the factual inaccuracies that have taken place , voters need to protect themselves from efforts at political manipulation			2
non-partisan web sites such as www.factcheck.org represent one source of unbiased information			2
they analyze ads and compile factual information in support of or in opposition to ad claims			2
other trustworthy fact - checkers include ad watches and reality checks run by leading news organizations			1
these features dissect candidate claims in regard to accuracy , strategy , and impact			0
but the best thing for voters to do is to watch the candidate debates and judge for themselves			2
study the statements and the factual bases of policy claims			0
pay attention to how the candidates speak and what they say			0
find out what non-partisan groups think and see what they have to say regarding the major issues			0
by the time the campaign is over , the presidential candidates are expected to have spent 55 percent of their overall budget on ads. strategists put together spots very carefully and pre-test major messages on small groups of voters			2
most of this money will be devoted to television spots			0
but increasingly amounts are being targeted on radio , direct mail , and internet appeals			0
in the end , voters are going to have to decipher competing charges and counter-charges amid considerable noise from all sides			2
the 2008 election is unusual in having so many big issues on the agenda : the economy , the @entity55 and @entity176 wars , health care , taxes , immigration , education and climate change			0
it is an election that truly matters because of the stark differences between the parties and the closeness of the campaign			0
voters need to pay serious attention to the facts in order to make a wise choice			2
