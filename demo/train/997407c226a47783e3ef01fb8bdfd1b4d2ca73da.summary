lesser known singers , rappers and bands can reach a wider audience by signing up and uploading their tracks			0
they can also monitor downloads and get paid a share of the revenue from those downloads			0
" there are no central rights holders of music in @entity5 and it 's therefore extremely hard to manage rights and offer a complete library to the consumers , " says ceo and co-founder @entity47			1
" for that reason illegal sites normally have the biggest library because they do n't clear any rights			0
" rapid growth @entity9 is funded by @entity62 - backed 88mph , a seed fund and accelerator that focuses on investing in web and mobile startups that target the @entity5 markets			2
