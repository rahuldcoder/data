@entity0 -- some @entity2 in @entity4 's capital were considering leaving , following a wave of bombings targeting members of their religion that left two dead and 16 others wounded			1
" i am 60 years old and i gave a lot to this country , but this tough situation is like a message asking me to leave my country , " said @entity10 , the male head of a @entity2 family whose house was targeted thursday in central @entity0			2
" if these attacks will continue , and the government ca n't stop them , then i do n't think we will have a future here			2
" the strikes appeared to be coordinated because they all took place within an hour , an @entity24 official said			1
explosives were left outside and in the gardens of 14 homes in six neighborhoods across @entity4 's sprawling capital			1
among the homes targeted by improvised explosive devices was one @entity37 dwelling that was picked because it had a christmas tree inside , the male head of the family , @entity32 , told @entity1			1
