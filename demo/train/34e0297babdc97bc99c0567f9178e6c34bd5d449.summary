-- @entity1 is reaching a point where it will no longer be able to function at all			1
over the past two years , some members of the @entity4 have ramped up the partisan wars on @entity6			1
they are threatening to bring the legislative process to a standstill			2
for many years , journalists and scholars have lamented the rise of partisan polarization on @entity6			0
the number of moderates has vastly declined and the number of bills that receive bipartisan support has greatly diminished			0
the usual culprits range from the advent of the 24 - hour news cycle to changing demographics			0
but now observers are starting to note that both parties are not equally to blame , especially in recent years			1
in their new book , " it 's even worse than it looks , " @entity24 and @entity25 -- two of the most prominent talking heads in @entity28 , known for their balanced view and proclivity toward moderation -- say that the @entity4 is to blame			1
" the @entity4 , " they wrote in a @entity38 op - ed based on the book , " has become an insurgent outlier in @entity37 politics			1
" @entity24 and @entity25 trace the partisan style back to the emergence of @entity43 and @entity44 in the 1970s , when the two men promoted a style of slash - and - burn , take - no - prisoners politics that has remained integral to the strategy of congressional @entity4			1
there is always a certain amount of nostalgia in @entity37 politics			0
the notion that @entity1 used to be a better place is one of the staple arguments in public rhetoric			1
but there are times when things are worse than usual			2
while both parties have played roles in the growth of polarization since the 1970s , since 2007 congressional republicans have been taking the partisan wars to new extremes in several areas			1
the first is with the kind of brinksmanship budgetary politics that has now become normative			0
last week , house speaker @entity71 once again threatened that @entity4 would not vote to increase the debt ceiling unless @entity73 agreed to certain tax and spending policies sought by the @entity4			1
@entity4 have used this tactic repeatedly in the past few years , each time bringing the nation closer to the brink of default			1
this is no way to decide on a budget or to handle the nation 's debt			0
holding the debt ceiling hostage to win political battles has undermined international confidence in the @entity37 political system			0
it has also created an unhealthy atmosphere where politicians are willing to take great risks with the goal of winning certain legislative battles			0
there need to be some limits to what legislators are willing to do in the pursuit of victory			0
the second way @entity4 push the envelope of partisanship is with the filibuster			1
as political junkies know , use of the filibuster has greatly increased since the 1970s			0
both parties have been guilty			2
a tool once reserved for high - profile legislation such as civil rights became a normalized tool of combat making the @entity114 a supermajoritarian body on almost every decision			0
senators do n't even have to filibuster anymore			0
they can simply raise the threat and that brings the discussion to an end			2
senators have also employed additional tactics such as anonymous holds , whereby senators can secretly prevent action on a bill and nobody can know who was responsible			0
but the number of filibusters by @entity4 has escalated , and they have been far more willing to use the tactic than their opponents			1
since 2007 , the @entity134 has shown , @entity73 have had to end @entity4 filibusters more than 360 times , a historic record			1
finally , there has been a much sharper shift to the right within the @entity4 than there has been to the left in the @entity73			1
here , too , the data is rather clear			0
in january , political scientists @entity144 and @entity146 concluded , based on their close analysis of the roll call vote , that " in the last few congresses , the overlap has vanished ; that is , the most liberal @entity4 is to the right of the most conservative @entity152			1
" last week , the political - science blog @entity154 pointed out that sen. @entity156 's political positions have changed little since he entered the @entity114 in 1977 , and yet : " in his first term in @entity1 , sen. @entity156 was the 23rd most moderate @entity4 in the @entity114 ; in the most recent term ( through 2011 ) , he was the fifth most moderate			1
" as @entity156 's recent primary loss shows , @entity4 activists are now targeting any member of the party who can be tagged as centrists , and they are pushing their caucus farther to the right , making compromise almost impossible			1
the current hardening of these procedural wars has some resemblance to the 1950s , when @entity174 committee chairmen , who were then the kings of @entity6 , used their power in the @entity176 and @entity114 to prevent any kind of progress on issues such as civil rights or health care			0
although a series of events allowed for a huge legislative breakthrough in 1964 and 1965 , the @entity174 committee chairs regained power after the 1966 midterm elections and continued to assert their power in the closed rooms of @entity6			0
the situation reached a boiling point in the 1970s , when in the aftermath of @entity193 , reformers transformed the system by weakening committee chairs , empowering party leaders and opening up the legislative process through sunshine rules and more			2
it could be that @entity4 will take things so far that we may reach one of those rare moments when congressional reform happens			2
if reform does not happen , and these trends continue , the nation will be left with an inoperative legislative process that ca n't handle the problems we face with the economy , social problems and foreign policy			0
this is a situation that should be of equal concern to the right , left and center			0
without a functional @entity1 , the nation 's government will not be able to live up to the challenges of the day			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

@entity224 : @entity1 is reaching a point where it will no longer be able to function
observers are starting to note that both parties are not equally to blame , @entity224 says
since 2007 , @entity73 have had to end @entity4 filibusters over 360 times , a record
@entity224 : @entity4 activists now target any party member who can be tagged as centrist
