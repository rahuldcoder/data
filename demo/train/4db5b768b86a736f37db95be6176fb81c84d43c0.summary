-- finding stability in my life has been a problem			1
i grew up on the 500 block of @entity6 in @entity7			1
when i was 1 month old , my mother abandoned me			1
she left me with a man whom i grew up to call my father			2
i was left with this man so that he could take care of me			1
instead , he paid other people to take care of me			1
he came around as much as he could to spend quality time with me , whether it was going to a park , going out for dinner or reading at the library			2
he tried with all his might to be there for me			2
but i soon began living in a real nightmare			2
oftentimes i felt alone , depressed			2
i even battled with thoughts of committing suicide because i felt no one really cared for me			2
there were nights when i ran away from the homes that had taken me in			1
i would go for walks and just cry because i did n't understand what i did wrong to deserve this childhood			2
when i was 10 , i began to receive negative vibes about my living situation			2
i called my father and asked if he could pick me up and remove me from the home in which i was staying			2
the next day , my nightmare became a reality			0
as i slept on the couch , my caretaker 's grandson discharged a 12 - gauge shotgun			1
the pellets fired through the wall and accidentally hit me in my spinal cord and right shoulder			1
all of a sudden , i could n't really move my right shoulder			0
i thought my life would be over soon			0
this is not what i wanted			0
i sat there bleeding , convinced that my time on earth would be cut short			0
my surroundings led me to think that i would become a victim of my own nightmare			0
i believed that this was the last day of my life because i could n't survive the way i was living			0
thankfully , i made it to hospital , and even though i was fading in and out , i survived			0
during my time in the hospital , i had to learn to walk again and move my right shoulder , which was temporally paralyzed			0
i was discharged from the hospital and sent to live with someone else who my father thought was able to take care of me			1
two weeks after staying in that household , i was placed in the @entity67 's foster care system			1
i was labeled a neglect case			0
even though i was finally getting help , i felt even more alone after being taken away from my father			0
years later , my mother would be found , only to turn down the opportunity to take custody of me			0
two years after i was shot , the only person who ever cared for me died of cancer			1
at that moment , i lost the one person who meant the world to me , my father , @entity75 a dna test later proved that the man that i thought was my father really was n't			1
eventually i would be placed at the @entity80 group home in @entity7 under the leadership of @entity82 and @entity83 , who revealed to me what the meaning of true love , patience and nourishment truly means			1
because of their support i began to see the light at the end of the tunnel			0
i lived in a total of 22 households before i was adopted by my close friend 's mom , @entity96			1
that 's when i knew that everything in my life was supposed to happen			1
i realized that you have to go through hell to find heaven			0
this summer , i had the pleasure of interning on @entity105 under sen. @entity106 of @entity107 for the @entity108 on @entity110 's @entity109			1
for the first time in my life , i spent two months around people who had battled what i battled and was overcome by their testimony			0
now i want to share my experiences with the world and help out anyone who is , or was , like me			0
i also feel the responsibility to give back to the city that birthed me , @entity7 , and i vow to do exactly that .			0

@entity75 lived in 22 different homes after being abandoned by his parents
in one house , he was accidentally shot by his caretaker 's grandson
@entity75 was eventually adopted ; he now plans to help other kids in foster care
