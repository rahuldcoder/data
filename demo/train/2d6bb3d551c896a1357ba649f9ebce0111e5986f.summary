if you 're looking to hook up via your smartphone , and are n't overly concerned about looking like a snob while doing so , @entity0 may be the app for you			1
billing itself as " @entity7 , minus the riff - raff , " the app , launched this month for @entity9 and in may for @entity11 devices , is designed to play matchmaker for the rich and beautiful -- all others be damned			1
" with the rise of high - speed digital dating , it 's about time somebody introduced a filter to weed out low - income prospects by neighborhood , " said the ceo of @entity15 in a media release			1
who is that ceo ? good question			2
a @entity0 spokesman on tuesday would only identify him as " @entity28 " ( it is worth noting , perhaps , that the only written review of the app in the @entity32 on tuesday was a 5 - star entry by a user with the screen name " @entity28 " ) spokesman @entity36 said the decision to keep " @entity28 's " identity private is likely due to negative feedback the app has received			1
@entity0 claims that the average income of male users is $ 200,000			1
@entity36 said , via email , that the team behind the app is working on an income - verification system but , in the meantime , is looking to the community to police itself			0
" if you show up in a 20 - year - old @entity51 , and request to meet at @entity52 , you wo n't last very long on @entity53 , " he said			1
" look , these members drive the best cars , hang out at the fanciest hotels , live in the biggest houses , wear the best clothes			0
it does n't take long to weed out those who belong on a different kind of dating site			1
" among the app 's current users are " ceos , professional athletes , doctors , lawyers , investors , entrepreneurs , beauty queens , fitness models and @entity74 celebrities , " according to the media release			2
the app has only been downloaded between 10 and 50 times , according to @entity78			0
@entity80 people must all have @entity81 ( @entity11 does n't provide download numbers )			2
so , how does the app decide which well - heeled hottie is right for you ? by asking which products you like to conspicuously consume , of course			0
users are asked to submit " their five favorite luxury style brands " for consideration			0
presumably , that will help track down the @entity98 - @entity97 - @entity96 - @entity95 - @entity94 enthusiast you 'll want to spend the rest of your life with			0
users may then scroll through profiles of others , tapping the ones they like and swiping away those that do n't meet their standards			0
if two users " like " each other , the app introduces them and sets up a chat .			0
