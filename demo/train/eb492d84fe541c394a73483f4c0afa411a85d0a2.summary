-- the grand jury has made its decision not to indict officer @entity3 in the death of @entity5 last august in @entity6 , @entity7			1
but another verdict became clear last night , too			2
the decision by @entity11 prosecuting attorney @entity10 to announce the decision at 8:30 p.m. @entity13 was foolish and dangerous			1
here 's the thing about that time of night : it 's dark			2
anyone -- anyone ! -- should have known that the decision in the @entity5 case would have been controversial			0
a decision not to indict , which was always possible , even likely , would have been sure to attract protests , even violence			0
crowd control is always more difficult in the dark			1
the grand jury 's deliberations concluded around lunchtime on monday			1
it would have been simple to make the announcement while it was still daytime			0
still , @entity10 said that he would not announce the grand jury 's decision until 8 p.m. ct			1
@entity33 's grand jury testimony at a news conference in the late afternoon , gov. @entity34 was asked about this nighttime announcement			1
in an answer that was consistent with his generally clueless performance throughout this crisis , @entity34 said the decision to announce the decision at night was made solely by @entity10			1
in other words , do n't ask him ! he 's only the governor ! complete coverage of what 's happening in @entity6 @entity10 started his announcement late , and he was not finished until around 9 p.m. , local time			2
his tone was icy and divisive			2
his sympathy for the @entity5 family was perfunctory			0
he seemed more angry at the news media than about the death of a young man			0
are protests taking place near you ? the predictable reaction ensued			0
protests began , some of them violent			0
police responded with tear gas			0
the full scale of the damage was difficult to assess last night			0
the ultimate verdict on the grand jury 's decision is up to history at this point			1
but the verdict on @entity10 opting to announce the decision at night is clear -- and devastating			1
protests spread far beyond @entity6			0

@entity75 says prosecutor 's *choice* to announce grand jury decision at night was clueless
he says deliberations ended at lunchtime , announcing at night was *needlessly* *provocative*
crowd control harder at night . @entity87 's tone was icy , *insensitive* , divisive , he says
@entity75 : violence ensued . verdict on @entity10 's decision on timing is clear , devastating
