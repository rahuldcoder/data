in @entity1 , african - americans make up 15 % of the population -- but account for 58 % of the marijuana - possession arrests , according to the @entity4			1
in @entity6 , @entity5 - @entity0 make up less than 25 % of the population -- but 60 % of the marijuana - possession arrests , the @entity4 says			1
and in @entity10 31 % of people arrested for marijuana possession are black , while african - americans make up just 5 % of the state 's population , the organization adds			2
those are just some of the statistics put forth by the @entity4 in a new report that the organization says shows wide racial disparities in marijuana arrest rates nationwide			1
using numbers it says come from @entity25 / @entity24 statistics and @entity0 @entity26 , the @entity4 report tracks marijuana arrests by race and county in all 50 states and the @entity31			2
it concludes that the nationwide rate of marijuana - possession arrests for blacks is nearly four times greater than for whites , when arrest totals are compared with proportions of the population			1
and the @entity4 says the findings show racial disparities in marijuana arrests have grown significantly over the past 10 years			2
counting both juvenile and adult arrests , rates for whites have remained steady at about 192 arrests per 100,000 people			2
but the arrest rate for blacks rose from 537 per 100,000 in 2001 to 716 per 100,000 in 2010 , according to the report , meaning that proportionately , blacks are 3.7 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana			2
@entity54 : @entity56 mom by day , pot grower by night according to the @entity4 , the racial disparity may still be greater			2
the @entity60 arrest data does not distinguish between white and @entity62 arrests because it does not identify @entity63 as a distinct racial group , meaning @entity63 arrested for marijuana possession are counted with whites			1
increasing arrest rates do n't correlate to marijuana usage rates by race , according to data from the @entity71 on @entity72 and @entity73 2001 - 2012 cited in the @entity4 report			1
among 18 - 25 year olds -- a group with higher arrest rates than other age groups , according to the report -- more whites than blacks said they used marijuana in surveys every year between 2001 and 2010			1
in 2010 , for example , 27.6 % of african - americans ages 18 - 25 and 33.4 % of whites in the same age group said they had used marijuana in the previous 12 months			0
@entity89 , executive director of the @entity90 , says despite the numbers , the disparity in arrest rates is n't racially motivated			1
@entity89 , who had n't read the @entity4 report but was familiar with it , said location and police intelligence were the main factors in marijuana arrests			1
" whenever we talk about drug enforcement , it 's predicated by intelligence and reports of activity , " he says , " not race or ethnic group			1
" @entity106 continues , " these days police have close scrutiny , and the words ' racial profiling ' scare most cops			0
they just want to do their jobs			0
" but @entity114 , director of the @entity115 and one of the primary authors of the new report , argues that racial disparity in marijuana arrests only cause more problems for people of color			0
" the aggressive policing of marijuana is time - consuming , costly , racially biased , and does n't work , " says @entity114			0
" these arrests have a significant detrimental impact on people 's lives , as well as on the communities in which they live			0
" the @entity4 study estimates that combined , @entity0 states spent over $ 3.6 billion enforcing marijuana possession laws in 2010 , and there was one marijuana arrest every 37 seconds			1
according to the @entity140 , " marijuana is a harmful drug and its use should be prevented and treated -- not promoted			0
" but @entity141 , professor of public policy and law at the @entity144 , says arrests do n't prevent marijuana use			0
" these arrests rarely result in prosecution , and there is no basis for believing this is a deterrent , " he told @entity147			0
" it 's hard to see the purpose being served			0
the only use i can see is putting certain people , and in this case young black men , on notice			0
when you look at the statistical pattern , it 's hard not to see this as racial profiling			0

the @entity4 cites what it says are wide disparities in arrest rates for marijuana possession
@entity4 : by population proportion , rates for blacks are nearly 4 times greater than whites
the head of a police group says the disparity is n't racially motivated
arrests are based on " intelligence and **...** activity **...** not race or ethnic group "
