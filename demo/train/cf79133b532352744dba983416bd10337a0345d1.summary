there 's been a sharp spike in radiation levels measured in the pipes and containers holding water at the crippled @entity7 nuclear plant in @entity8			1
but the company in charge of cleaning it up says that only a single drop of the highly contaminated water escaped the holding tanks			0
@entity15 said it is confident it can provide safety for workers dealing with the problem			2
" we will find out the cause of this issue and make proper counter measures immediately , and continue to make every effort to secure safety of workers , " the company said in a statement released sunday			0
@entity15 found high radiation readings at the contaminated water storage tanks and pipe saturday			1
the four locations are the bottom of three tanks and a pipe connecting tanks in separate area			0
the highest reading as 1800 millisieverts per hour at the bottom fringe of the tank			0
220 and 70 @entity38 were measured at the bottom of other two tanks			0
and @entity15 said they found a dried stain under the pipe with 230 msv / h radiation measurement			1
one drop of liquid fell when a staff member pressed on insulation material around the pipe			0
but @entity15 said no contaminated water leak is expected as there were no change in the water level in tanks			2
the enormous tanks are identical to the container that was announced last week to have leaked 300 tons of highly toxic water and sparking a hike to the threat level to " serious			0
" @entity15 will investigate the cause and look further if there were any leakage			2
but @entity15 also took issue with reporting by some news outlets that the new radiation levels were high enough to cause death after several hours of exposure			1
it said the highest levels measured were so - called beta radiation , which quickly dissipates over short distances and is easily shielded through the use of thin sheets of metal and foil			1
" since beta radiation is weak and can be blocked by a thin metal sheet such as aluminum , we think that we can control radiation exposure by using proper equipments and cloths , " the company added			1
why @entity7 is worse than you think @entity15 looks for outside help to stabilize @entity7 @entity83 tuna study finds miniscule health risks @entity8 ponders freezing ground			2
