-- will @entity1 reform the @entity2 ? the question seems urgent now that the @entity4 has released a damning report about the use of interrogation methods by the @entity2 in the years that followed the tragic attacks on 9/11			1
the committee reported that the @entity2 had used extensive forms of " enhanced interrogation , " misleading the @entity12 and @entity1 about what was going on			1
waterboarding , mock executions , rectal feeding , sleep deprivation and threats of rape were all part of the program			2
not only did the tactics appear to violate acceptable and maybe legal standards of interrogation , but , according to the committee , they were not effective in obtaining necessary information			2
now the question that faces @entity1 is : will there be reforms to make sure that this does not happen again ? there have been a variety of proposals put onto the table , ranging from the appointment of an independent prosecutor to look into the role of high - level @entity37 administration officials to strict prohibitions on the kinds of facilities that the @entity2 can maintain to compensation for victims of enhanced interrogation			1
former president @entity44 said that the nation needs to " keep pushing " on this			0
@entity47 : @entity2 chief @entity48 , more credible than torture report ? reform is not impossible			1
there have been periods of true change			0
in the 1970s , the shocking findings of sen. @entity56 's committee on intelligence activities , such as the fact that the @entity2 had been involved in assassination attempts and spied on @entity61 citizens , produced reform			1
@entity1 passed the @entity63 , which put constraints on federal agents			1
in contrast , though , the chances for that kind of action today are extraordinarily slim			1
despite then editorials and op - eds calling for something to be done , it is difficult to expect any real changes resulting from this report			1
why is this case ? why does something so shocking have so little effect ? why are we unlikely to see a repeat of the 1970s when the revelation of rogue unaccountable intelligence agents doing bad things created political pressure for genuine changes ? the most important factor is that when it comes to national security , fear usually triumphs over almost everything else			1
the mid- 1970s , in the aftermath of @entity92 and @entity93 , were exceptions			1
as the historians @entity96 and @entity98 captured in their excellent book " @entity61 's @entity100 , " electoral politics usually moves voters toward favoring militaristic solutions			1
politicians in both parties manipulate the anxieties of voters rather than their hopes			0
this time is no different			0
policymakers have been doing this since the 2002 midterm elections when some @entity112 blasted @entity113 as weak on defense for opposing president @entity37 's homeland security proposals			2
popular culture has also been extremely kind to torture			0
@entity61 have been bombarded with a barrage of movies and television shows where agents are seen extracting vital information through devious means			0
@entity124 had no regrets : ' i would do it again in a minute ' in the television show " 24 , " @entity128 used whatever means necessary to save the world from terrorists			0
in the movie " @entity133 , " torture is shown as allowing @entity61 agents to find and kill @entity136			0
sen. @entity137 had criticized the film for shaping public opinion " in a disturbing and misleading manner			0
" there have not been as many shows , such as " scandal , " that depict the dark side of intelligence agents ( in their case , the supersecret agency b - 613 )			2
we also have a public that in the post- 9/11 era that has grown so cynical about what the government does and what it is capable of doing , that nothing seems to shock any more			0
with each new revelation comes another round of complaint and lament , but the public rarely makes this a central issue when comes time to vote			0
the outrage that followed the @entity163 seems quaint			0
according to a @entity166 / @entity165 poll , @entity61 have become much more accepting of torture			0
fifty percent of @entity61 polled in august 2013 said that torture was sometimes justified			0
nor can we expect anything of the scale and scope of @entity2 reform from a @entity1 that can barely pass a budget			1
there has already been an intense partisan divide in the response to the report , with some in the @entity178 warning that this will bring great danger to the party			2
even many @entity113 are not that eager to take this on			0
then there is president @entity184 , who despite entering the @entity12 on a campaign in 2008 that challenged president @entity37 's policies , has not done that much to transform them			2
to be sure , he did announce early in his presidency that he would not accept the use of torture and issued a statement last week saying that the tactics described in the current report did not reflect the nation 's values			1
the torture ban was a hugely important change , but many skeptics still wonder whether that will be tough enough to prevent this from happening again			0
as @entity201 recounted in the @entity202 , @entity184 rejected creating a " truth commission " to investigate the @entity2 's use of torture or the pursuit of any criminal prosecutions			1
in other areas , such as @entity209 surveillance and drone strikes , he has strengthened @entity37 - era policies			2
there are many controversial techniques that are still permissible , such as force feeding prisoners on hunger strikes and lengthy , intense periods of solitary confinement			0
so it 's probably best not to expect much from @entity220			2
this is not the 1970s , and the chances for substantive reform are not good			1
it is a safe bet that the @entity2 will probably continue to engage in versions of these tactics for many years to come .			1

@entity228 : last week 's report on @entity2 activities revealed **abuses** that ca *n't* be repeated
he says the odds are slim that @entity1 will move *decisively* to reform the @entity2
in the 1970s , disclosure of **abuses** did result in *sweeping* changes , he said
@entity228 : today 's @entity1 is ill - suited to take on task as difficult as @entity2 reform
