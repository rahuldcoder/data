the sister of a @entity2 citizen sentenced to 15 years in a @entity4 labor camp defended her brother thursday , asking leaders of both nations to " please , just see him as one man			1
" @entity11 , known as @entity12 by @entity2 authorities , was found guilty of unspecified " hostile acts " against the reclusive @entity16 state , the @entity4 's state - run @entity10 reported			1
@entity10 said the @entity17 was arrested november 3 after arriving as a tourist in @entity19 , a port in the northeastern corner of @entity4			0
@entity4 law allows up to 10 days of processing before a sentence is enforced , so it was n't immediately clear when @entity12 would report for hard labor , or where he was being held in the meantime			1
" we just pray , and ask for leaders of both nations to please , just see him as one man , caught in between , " @entity27 , @entity12 's sister , told @entity29 's @entity28 360			1
" he 's a father to three children , and we just ask that he be allowed to come home			0

@entity12 is the owner of a tour company and was in @entity4 for work , according to @entity36			1
" he did n't have any problems going there last time , last year five times , so he did n't have any reason to suspect that there would be any trouble this time around , " she said			0
her brother 's case raises the possibly of another delicate diplomatic dance over an @entity2 captive			1
in previous instances , @entity4 has released @entity2 in its custody after a visit by some @entity2 dignitary -- in recent cases , former presidents @entity62 and @entity63			1
but @entity12 's case could get caught up in the recent tensions between the @entity4 , as the @entity4 is formally known , and the @entity2			1
" you all are aware of the history and how this has happened in the past with @entity2 citizens , " @entity67 spokesman @entity66 told reporters in @entity69			1
" but what we 're calling for and we 're urging the @entity4 authorities to do is to grant him amnesty and to allow for his immediate release , full stop			1
" @entity66 said the @entity67 is still trying to confirm details of the case through @entity83 diplomats who visited @entity12 last week			1

" we 've had longstanding concerns about the lack of transparency and due process in the @entity4 legal system , " he said			0
" so now that mr. @entity12 has gone through a legal process , we urge the @entity4 to grant him amnesty and immediate release			1
" @entity2 officials have struggled to establish how exactly @entity12 fell afoul of @entity4 authorities			1
the @entity4 statement on his conviction provided no details of the allegations against him			0
" this was somebody who was a tour operator , who has been there in the past and has a visa to go to the @entity4 , " a senior @entity2 official told @entity29 on monday , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue			2

@entity69 responded by deploying additional missile interceptors on the @entity121 , dispatching a missile defense system to the @entity124 territory of @entity125 and bolstering annual @entity2 - @entity127 military exercises with overflights by nuclear - capable @entity129 and b - 52 bombers			0
