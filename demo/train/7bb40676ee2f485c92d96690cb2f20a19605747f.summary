-- what are you thankful for this year ? for many of you , that 's probably a tough question to answer			1
this year has n't been easy , between @entity7 and @entity8 and @entity9 and the economy and ... well , we could go on			1
but here 's the interesting thing about @entity14 : the idea to set aside a day for humble reflection and gratitude was itself inspired by troubling times			1
as the story goes , the first @entity14 was held in 1621 by the @entity20 who 'd managed to survive their arrival in the @entity22 and who were eager to celebrate their first successful harvest after a hellish , deadly winter			1
almost 250 years later , in the midst of a war that threatened to tear the @entity29 apart , president @entity26 declared that the entire nation would annually honor the last thursday of november as a " day of @entity14 and @entity31			1
" even when president @entity32 tried ( unsuccessfully ) to celebrate the holiday a week earlier in 1939 , allowing a little extra time for @entity36 shopping , he did so with a nation battered by the @entity38 on his mind			1
if there 's ever a time to pause and think about gratitude , it 's in the hard moments			1
some people think that they need to share something profound when they practice giving thanks , but we do n't believe that 's true			1
whatever inspires you , gives you hope or makes you smile is fair game			1
for us , these five moments from 2014 bring about all of the above			1
what would you add to the list ? 1			1
we saw that nothing is impossible			1
in may , we got to meet @entity60 para-table tennis player @entity59 , a man who did n't let a life - altering accident stand in the way of his dreams			1
growing up in northeastern @entity60 , @entity59 ( also spelled @entity64 ) was a big fan of soccer and table tennis			1
but when he was 10 , the future athlete lost both of his arms in a train accident			2
it took him three years to return to table tennis			2
when he did , it was an uphill climb			2
" it was quite difficult , " @entity59 said			2
" i had to practice hard for three consecutive years on a daily basis			2
" he tried different ways of holding the paddle and eventually settled on holding it in his mouth to play			2
now a silver medalist in the @entity82 , @entity59 played against some of the sport 's best at the @entity84 in may			2
" i want to tell everybody that nothing is impossible , and everybody should work hard for what you love and what you think is good for yourself , " @entity59 told the @entity86			2
" the disability is not in arms or legs ; the disability is to not persevere in whatever you would like to do			2
family that was lost can be found			2
imagine that you have a twin somewhere out there , one you never knew you had			2
and then imagine that , through a crazy bit of luck and the gift of modern technology , you and your twin get to meet for the first time			1
as it turns out , that story actually happened this year -- and more than once			0
one set of twins , @entity113 and @entity114 , lived apart for 78 years before a search into their family tree unearthed their connection			0
and for 26 - year - old identical twins @entity121 and @entity123 , it was the magical way @entity124 has made our world just that much smaller that brought them together after they were separated at birth			0
@entity121 and @entity123 are n't the only ones who used @entity124 to connect with those long - lost			0
in early march , a young woman named @entity134 posted a message on the social media platform asking for help in finding her birth mother , who left @entity134 in the restroom of a @entity140 more than 20 years ago			0
the result of @entity134 's shot in the dark was the opportunity to meet the woman who did n't want to leave behind her child but felt she had no other options			0
when the two women came face to face , " they immediately hugged , " said an attorney who set up @entity134 's meeting with her birth mom			0
" it was exciting , emotional , dramatic			0
" for all the moments that social media can be an annoyance or a playground for bullies , there are stories like these that show how online connections can lead to great things			1
people renewed our faith in humanity			0
read the paper or watch the news , and it wo n't take long before you 're ready to be done with all people , everywhere			1
but here 's a reminder that things are n't all bad : when a bartender in @entity177 confided in a customer that her dog was having an expensive emergency surgery , that customer left her a $ 1,000 tip to help cover the cost			0
and when a man in @entity185 named @entity186 kept getting stopped by police because of his resemblance to cop killer suspect @entity189 , his community pitched in to help			0
@entity186 did n't own a vehicle , and those police stops would happen as he walked five miles to work and back every day			0
knowing that @entity186 was not a suspect but just a guy trying to earn a living , a local woman started an online campaign and raised $ 22,000 -- more than enough to buy @entity186 that car			0
we saw super-rare blood moons			0
this year , those in @entity202 got to see not one but two blood moons , an eclipse so rare that major figures like @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity26 , @entity208 and sir @entity209 never had the chance to see one			0
and the fun is n't over yet			0
there are still two more to go in 2015			0
it 's never too late to try something new			0
just before @entity14 , a 100 - year - old woman named @entity217 made the trip of a lifetime			1
since she was a child , @entity217 had longed to see the ocean , but she never had the money or the time for a trip to the beach			1
so for her 101st birthday , the thing @entity217 most wanted was to finally make it to the shore			0
with help from an organization called @entity230 , which helps seniors achieve their life dreams , @entity217 was able to do just that			0
the organization provided her with an all - expenses - paid visit to the @entity237 , where she was able to feel the sand between her toes for the very first time			1
" i 've heard people talk about it and how wonderful it was and wanted to see it , " @entity217 said , according to the @entity242			0
" but i never had the opportunity to do so			0
" it may have taken some time , but @entity217 can now cross " beach " off her bucket list .			1
