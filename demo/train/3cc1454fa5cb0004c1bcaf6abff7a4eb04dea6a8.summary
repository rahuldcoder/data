-- every woman who 's worked in an office has her story about discrimination or , as they say in the @entity7 confabs , " inappropriate behavior			1
" mine is the day i was chatting with colleagues in a newsroom some years back when i suddenly felt two meaty hands massaging my shoulders			0
" i 'm not sure who you are , " i said before turning to face my uninvited masseur			0
" but take your ( expletive - deleted ) hands off me			2
" the mystery hands belonged to my editor			0
i thought about that day while reading " @entity23 , " the just - published history of the first class - action discrimination lawsuit ever brought against a media organization in 1970			2
@entity24 , a 47 - year journalism veteran who started as a secretary in the @entity27 bureau of @entity28 in 1965 , tells the story of 46 women with degrees from top schools who got tired of a system that relegated them to jobs checking facts and clipping newspaper stories , while men with similar credentials got the bylines and big salaries			1
@entity24 and her female coworkers recruited fellow plaintiffs at secret meetings in the ladies ' room			0
they hired @entity48 , the civil rights lawyer who today is a @entity50 congresswoman			0
and then they announced their lawsuit on march 16 , 1970 , inspiring the headline " @entity57 for @entity58 " in the @entity54 , which went out of its way to note that most of the plaintiffs were young , " and most of them pretty			0
" the magazine 's official response : " the fact that most researchers at @entity57 are women and that virtually all writers are men stems from a newsmagazine tradition going back almost fifty years			1
a string of similar lawsuits against other news organizations ensued , and journalism 's male guard was embarrassed into making some changes			1
today , a woman is editor of the @entity74 , and a woman has just been named that newspaper 's public editor			2
you might think that gutsy efforts like those of the " dollies , " as the @entity57 women were called by their male bosses , would have led to a media world that was all fixed on the gender front 42 years later			2
you 'd be thinking wrong			2
it 's a funny thing about journalism			2
the public has this idea that the media world is run by bleeding - heart liberals more focused on homeless shelters than tax shelters			2
you know , progressive thinkers looking to change the world			0
reality is it 's a business like most others , run largely by men who push back at serious threats to their authority			1
in the old days , i had to stand up to cretins like @entity105			0
@entity106 , a @entity57 researcher who would go on to found @entity107 in 1987 , had to put up with some guy she barely knew who walked by on deadline and " planted a soft kiss on her neck , " as @entity24 describes it			0
today 's woman journalists are less likely to get massaged and smooched on the job			0
but 42 years after that lawsuit , women are still shut out : men make up 60 % of newspaper employees , write 80 % of newspaper op - eds and author most articles in " thought leader " magazines such as the @entity124 , which last year had 242 female bylines , 613 male			1
the record for " new media " is better than print , though men and women are still nowhere near parity			1
in a report earlier this year , the @entity134 said 33 % of op - eds in the @entity137 and on @entity138 were written by women			1
at @entity57 , where a woman , @entity141 , has run the show since the merger of @entity57 and the @entity145 website in november of 2010 , the imbalance has improved in the four decades since the women 's lawsuit			1
in a march 18 , 2010 cover story " @entity153 " written by three @entity57 women , the authors said 39 percent of the people on the masthead were women , up from 25 % in 1970			1
but men still had the star power , writing 43 of the 49 cover stories the previous year			0
now try to square those numbers with these : over the past 10 years , between 70 and 76 % of all journalism and mass communications graduates have been women			1
at one of my journalism jobs , i blew a fuse one day over my male colleagues getting the high - profile web page spots where readers would find their stories while my work was out of sight			1
i complained , and my boss shot back an e-mail saying i 'd cooked up a " conspiracy theory			0
" lest i should get any future impulses to be uppity , he warned , " i do n't plan to address this issue again			0
" even a newshen with a byline is supposed to know her place			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			1

@entity185 : women used to be *routinely* *harassed* and passed over in newsrooms
she says more women have gotten better posts , but men still *dominate* the business
she says men have 60 % of jobs at papers , write 80 % of op - eds and get far more bylines
@entity202 : women are up to 76 % of recent news grads ; what 's wrong with this picture ?
