-- when @entity2 first won the @entity3 in 2009 , it set him on course for a career - high ranking of no. 2 in the world later that year			1
he kept that lofty status for less than a month , but sunday 's painstaking victory in the final against @entity11 has taken him back there and earned the 25 - year - old a second title at @entity14			1
the @entity16 tennis star , who owns a home nearby , came back to practice for three weeks after his @entity20 final defeat in january			1
he had to save a match point in the final set before he finally triumphed 2 - 6 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 7 - 1 ) against fifth - ranked @entity11			1
" it was a brutal match and at the end both of us were very , very tired			2
i just managed to get over the line			0
physically it was an exhausting match , " last year 's losing finalist told @entity0			2
" i 'm used to the conditions here and that helped			0
" he earlier said on court after the match : " that sort of match a couple of years ago i probably would have lost			2
i was up a break three or four times in the third set and kept letting him back in through some loose shots			0
" i tried to keep fighting , chased down every ball , made it as hard for him as possible			0
there was a lot riding on the match and i was glad to get through in the end			2
" the victory lifted @entity2 above 17 - time grand slam champion @entity50 , who did not play in @entity3 after experiencing back problems during his quarterfinal defeat against @entity53 at @entity54			1
it is the first time since november 2003 that neither @entity50 or @entity53 have been in the top two			1
" the no. 1 goal for me is to win the major events and then the ranking takes care of itself , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
" getting to no. 2 is a good achievement			1
i hope i can go higher but it 's incredibly hard right now , with the guys around at the top of the game			2
i 'll give it my best shot			0
" @entity11 , who had been seeking to become the first @entity69 to win the @entity3 title , was denied his second masters - level crown after a demoralizing defeat that means he has yet to beat a top - five player in any of his 37 career finals			1
" there will be another situation like today , but my life does n't change for one match			2
i need to work hard and to be focused for the next tournaments , " said @entity11 , who turns 31 on tuesday			1
however , he did regret his decision to use a challenge on one of @entity2 's shots during his match point -- it was ruled in			1
" the ball , it was really close			0
i saw it out ... i made my decision in that moment			0
it 's a bad moment now			0
i do n't want to think anymore about that			0
i want to forget as fast as possible			0
" @entity11 could have moved above fourth - ranked @entity53 if he had won , with his compatriot having sat out the tournament to rest his knee following his title at @entity54			1
the men 's schedule will switch focus to the @entity100 quarterfinals this week before the beginning of the @entity103 clay - court season , where @entity2 will be seeking to retain his status for the @entity105			1
" if i 'd served better i could have made it easier and that 's something i need to do better in the clay court season , " he said			0
" this week i did a lot of things well but i need to serve better			0
if i serve better i 'll be able to win matches like today more comfortably			0
it 's easier to return on clay so it 's even more important to serve well			0
