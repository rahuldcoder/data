in the summer of 2007 , mobile health was a field in its infancy			1
monsoon season in @entity5 , however , was in full swing , and with it came an enormous spike in cholera cases			0
i was working at a diarrheal disease hospital in the capital , @entity12 , at the time			0
more than 1,000 patients were rushed to the hospital on stretchers every day , most admitted to the makeshift wards of canvas tents that sprawled over parking lots and spilled into the streets			2
it was there that i saw my first patient die			0
he was a 53 - year - old male , a husband and a father , emaciated and severely dehydrated			2
i remember struggling to place an iv into his cephalic vein , shuddering at the words repeating in my mind			2
he looks like a corpse			0
in 10 minutes he passed away , and we learned that his family had brought him on a three - day journey to the capital for treatment			2
they were wholly unaware that a satellite clinic had been deployed no more than 20 minutes away from their home			0
this was an enormous tragedy , and for years i would think about how it could have been prevented			0
it turned out that a solution was in place and waiting to be discovered			0
the key is to leverage the unprecedented communication boom that 's happening today			0
health : tracking your body with technology it is easy to forget that the mobile revolution has been a global phenomenon			1
of the more than 6 billion cell phone subscriptions worldwide , 76 % are in developing countries			1
from rural @entity59 to bustling @entity60 , cell phone coverage and penetrance have become surprisingly advanced			0
when i saw the potential of how we can radically transform the way we deliver health care to underserved populations , i co-founded @entity67 in the hopes of building new models of health care support networks from simple , sms - based platforms			1
this direction opened the gateway to establishing emergency triage systems , sending medication adherence reminders , enabling home - based antenatal care , tracking community immunization and dispatching mass announcements detailing satellite clinic schedules and locations			1
handheld device that saves lives for example , in @entity85 , @entity86 , where first - year childhood vaccination rates have lingered in the 60th percentile , we worked with a local immunization center to design a mobile - based reminder system for parents			1
local health workers enrolled newly pregnant women in our records and took down their cell phone number			2
once the system was updated with an infant 's birth date , it would automatically schedule sms reminders to be sent to the family when it was time for a vaccination			2
the system also sent periodic educational messages about the importance of complete immunization and the diseases they protected against			0
after six months of piloting this intervention , we were already seeing dramatic improvements in vaccination rates			0
mothers walked into the clinic grinning , baby in one hand , cell phone in the other			0
while i am focused on helping people in the developing countries , i am keenly aware that mobile health care innovations also impact people close to home			1
working at @entity127 hospitals , i can attest to the luxury of checking my patients ' vital signs while lying in bed , or test driving in - house communication systems for consultations , which utilize smartphones rather than 1980 's - era pagers			2
health : your smartphone is a pain in the neck mobile health development in the @entity142 means innovating with the newest technologies , from diabetes management apps to miniature diagnostic devices , all aiming to capitalize on the potential of the latest tablets and smartphones			1
the possibilities are truly mind - blowing			1
interestingly , @entity142 - based mobile health care innovations can serve as testing beds for tools that will likely be deployed in @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 , or @entity157 in the coming years			1
and many sms - based innovations gaining prominence abroad might return to the developed world as cost - effective methods of addressing fundamental problems in our overburdened health care system			1
i like to think that the paths of innovation are convergent			0
imagine a world where , whether you 're sporting an @entity170 or a @entity171 3100 , you can remotely access your medical information , reschedule doctors ' appointments , monitor loved ones ' vital signs , receive secure lab results , compete for " best blood sugar control , " manage tailored medication reminders , etc. that day may not be that far off .			1

many of the 6 billion *wireless* subscriptions worldwide are in developing countries
@entity185 : mobile tech can radically transform the way we deliver health care
he says doctors can easily send reminders to patients about medication , vaccination
@entity185 : mobile health care innovations in the @entity142 are mind - blowing
