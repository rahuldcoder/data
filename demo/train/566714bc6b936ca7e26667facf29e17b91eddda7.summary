some of the most political , partisan and competitive women in politics compete on the same team -- a softball team , anyway			1
the annual @entity4 pits members of @entity6 against a media team to raise money for young women in their fight against breast cancer			0
while the early morning practices and the rare injuries are all for a good cause that has already raised $ 150,000 this year , in this midterm election year " bases loaded " has additional meaning			0
not only is control of the @entity19 on the line but so are some members ' jobs -- scenarios where errors have consequences			2
@entity27 co-captain and six - year softball veteran is running in one highly competitive race			1
after numerous easily won congressional contests in @entity33 's second district , rep. @entity30 is vying for the open senate seat in her state			1
and it 's her fellow co-captain 's job to defeat her			2
at annual women 's congressional softball game , @entity38 to throw out first pitch in her role as head of the @entity44 , rep. @entity41 is responsible for electing as many democrats to office as possible			1
it 's an environment ripe for bitter rivalries to infiltrate any task at hand			0
but on the diamond , @entity30 and @entity41 insist politics is put aside as they focus on two common goals : beating the press and cancer			1
" we avoid politics on the field , " @entity30 said			1
@entity41 , who battled breast cancer , agreed during the joint interview at an early rainy morning practice			2
" i do n't ' think we have the desire to talk politics on the field			0
we 're just friends out here , " she said			0
most of the time , anyway			0
@entity30 admitted that sometimes partisan discussions do ensue , but teammates from the opposite side of the aisle shut it down , fast			2
" it 's not like we have n't edged into politics , but then we pull ourselves back , " @entity30 said			1
@entity41 , who is considered a partisan firebrand , an effective but sometimes contentious quality atop the @entity74 , insists that the field is " a politics - free zone			1
" @entity4 sisterhood a powerful voice for the voiceless while their sometimes thrice a week practices might not be overtly political , @entity30 admits that it does sometimes " enter into our minds because we 're living it			2
" but for the sake of beating the media team , which they 've done one in five games , and for raising money for young cancer survivors , they maintain that the field is a " refuge " for the 20 members who can put their smart phones down , pick up a bat and enjoy the early morning turf field			0
but politics runs through their blood and they proved that it is omnipresent			0
@entity30 hopes for " a great crowd for a great cause			0
" that 's diplomatic trash talk , " @entity41 quipped with a laugh , adding , " she 's running for the @entity19			1
