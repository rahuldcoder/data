-- if @entity3 committed sexual harassment and is now lying about it , his goose is cooked and it should be			1
but if he is telling the truth , there is something terribly disconcerting about the way the @entity13 " scandal industrial complex " -- full of reporters , former campaign workers and pundits -- has reacted to this sad story			1
after the story broke in @entity18 , @entity3 the next day denied that he sexually harassed anyone , which after all , is the core issue			1
since then , other anonymous sources claim they too were harassed , without anyone really knowing what the alleged harassment entailed			0
he has been consistent , unwavering and on the record in his denial			0
but that 's not good enough for the way things work in @entity13 , where the manner in which he reacted to the news is said to be a sign of whether he would make a good president			1
he is being assailed because he remembered more information and therefore " his story changed , " an unforgivable development for those who cover scandal news			1
journalists trotted out their well - worn formula for keeping a scandal story alive by saying that his " answers led to more unanswered questions , " even though he already answered the only question that matters -- did he harass anyone ? experts who know scandals decry his failure to have " gotten ahead of the story			1
" he should have seen this coming , they say , and pre-empted it , the way all clever @entity13 politicians , skilled in the art of survival , would have done			1
my problem with this line of attack is it 's exactly what has made politicians , and often the reporters who cover them , so disconnected from the rest of the country			2
@entity3 's reaction has been human			1
it 's been just the opposite of what a politician who prizes political survival above all would have done			2
imagine that you were accused of doing something you did not do 12 years ago			0
you have a staff and your staff figured out a way to make it go away			0
good , you might say			0
i did n't do it and it deserves to go away			0
you then put the issue out of your mind			0
then 12 years later , the allegations re-emerge			0
it 's not unnatural that you start to remember more facts			2
some details come back to you			0
that 's the way the human mind works			2
it 's not the way political minds work			2
in a year in which people of all parties are fed up with how @entity13 conducts its business , it 's ironic that @entity3 is now being assailed by @entity13 insiders for his failure to act like a @entity13 insider			1
i know all the tricks of the trade			0
if @entity3 spent 21 years in @entity13 like i did , he would have pre-empted the issue by giving a speech about what it takes to make it in business			1
as he cited his successes , he could have addressed how hard it can sometimes be to make it in @entity115 today			0
how innocent statements he once made to his staff led to threatened lawsuits			0
how despite his knowing he did nothing wrong , he was advised to " settle " the matter so it did n't become a bigger distraction			0
what 's $ 35,000 to a multimillion dollar industry ? trial lawyers , excess regulations , union demands all make it so hard to create jobs and achieve growth			1
he could have gotten the news out himself , framed in a way that minimized the " scandal " and maximized his themes about the economy			2
how very @entity13 , and clever , that would have been			1
if @entity3 was the same type of skilled politician who has made @entity13 what it is has largely become -- an assemblage of smooth - talking , gifted experts in creating a massive debt that risks our future , while being seemingly incapable of doing anything about it other than blaming the other guy -- he might have acted differently			1
but he 's not an insider			2
he said what came naturally			0
he remembered more facts -- a very human development -- and said them			0
scandal experts will tell you not to remember more information			2
stick to your denial and say nothing else , they would advise			0
@entity3 did n't do that because he 's not like that			1
and because he 's different , he 's being pilloried for how he has handled the allegations			2
before these anonymous allegations hit , i publicly said , and i repeat , i like the fact that @entity3 is an outsider , but i do n't think he 's ready for the @entity168			1
i wanted someone who thinks like an outsider but who has also served as a governor ( think @entity174 's @entity173 ) so he or she has the knowledge and experience to get programs through @entity178			0
i 'm neutral in this primary			0
but as well - versed as i am in the ways of @entity13 , i 'm the first to admit that the ways of @entity13 are a big part of the problem			1
the public is yearning for someone who is genuine and who does n't act like a perfect politician			0
unfortunately , the scandal industrial complex does its business the @entity13 way , judging @entity3 's reaction according to formulas that were written by perfect politicians			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			1

@entity3 has repeatedly denied sexually harassing women
@entity196 : if he is lying , he 's in big trouble
but if @entity3 is telling the truth , the response to story is disconcerting , @entity196 says
