what do @entity0 , @entity2 's silk boxer shorts and a waterproof hiking jacket have in common ? spider silk is being used in pioneering research to regrow damaged bones and teeth answer : they are all , in their own way , helping to push forward the boundaries of modern medical science			1
more specifically , two separate research teams in the @entity15 have been using materials normally associated with clothing ( and a certain arachnid superhero ) to provide novel , high - tech solutions to age - old health problems			2
at @entity23 , @entity22 scientists are pioneering a method of manipulating spider silk to genetically engineer new bone tissue , thus allowing them -- in theory -- to re-grow damaged bones and teeth			1
at @entity32 , @entity31 , meanwhile , a team of cardiologists are trialing a device made of @entity34 -- the waterproof fabric used in much outdoor clothing -- to help repair holes in the human heart			1
the @entity23 research , headed by professor @entity40 of the @entity41 , is focusing on ways of using silk -- or rather the constituent proteins of which silk is made -- to create a hybrid material that can then be used as a " scaffold " on which to grow new bone and tooth cells			1
why silk ? because not only is it extremely tough -- its tensile strength is six times that of steel fibre of an equal diameter -- but also bio-compatible , meaning it does not cause an adverse reaction when introduced into the human body			1
" we are playing around with silk from silk worms , " one of @entity64 's collaborators , professor @entity62 of @entity65 in the @entity66 , told @entity67 , " but the bulk of our work is using fusion proteins derived from spider silk			0
" the science is complex -- osteogenic differentiation , chimeric proteins and novel nanocomposites are just a few of the terms involved -- but the basic idea is that , working at a molecular level , you combine elements of silk protein with those of some other protein with desirable properties to create the building blocks of an entirely new material			2
this material -- precisely what form it will take is as yet uncertain -- will then be used to fill a hole or a break in a bone or a tooth , acting as a " scaffold " on which stem cells taken from elsewhere in the patient 's body can grow to form replacement tissue			1
because silk is also biodegradable , the scaffold would then dissolve away over time like sutures , leaving just the new bone			2
" it 's an important step in the process of trying to grow replacement body parts , " professor @entity103 of the @entity104 -- an expert in the mechanical properties of silk -- told @entity67			0
" right now if you want a replacement part you need a donor , but this sort of technology is one piece in the jigsaw of growing your own replacement			0
the health implications are potentially huge			0
" the work being carried out at @entity32 is not , on the face of it , quite as scientifically ground - breaking as that of @entity64 and his team			1
if successful , however , it could prove every bit as significant			0
as with @entity64 , the @entity32 team -- led by cardiologist dr. @entity130 -- is adapting an everyday material to a novel medical application			1
in this case the material is a variation on waterproof @entity34 , known as @entity136			1
the latter has been fashioned into a minute , umbrella - shaped device -- the snappily - named @entity139 -- that can be used to plug a @entity140 ( @entity140 ) , a common hole found in the upper chambers of the heart of one in five @entity15			1
although in itself not necessarily dangerous , a @entity140 can be for stroke victims			0
" we are proposing that closing the hole will be more effective in preventing stroke relapse than taking medications for the rest of your life , " dr. @entity130 told @entity67			0
although an occluder - style device has already been used successfully for some years in plugging @entity156 , another type of heart hole , these are the first official randomized trials to ascertain its effectiveness in cases of @entity140			2
" it comes in three different sizes , " explains dr. @entity130 , " twenty , 25 and 30 mm , and is passed through an incision in the groin up through an artery into the heart , where we position it using a microscopic camera			0
" the operation takes 45 minutes , the patient is awake throughout and goes home the next day			0
" given that pfos are implicated in approximately 40 percent of strokes in the @entity15 -- about 120,000 people -- this technology could make a very big difference			0
" @entity34 hearts and silk bones -- fashion will never seem quite the same again .			2
