-- two @entity2 funnymen are apparently entering into the partisan political fray with rallies of their own in the nation 's capital			1
@entity8 and @entity9 have set october 30 as the date for their respective rallies			1
on thursday night 's airing of " @entity15 , " the comedian announced plans for a " @entity17			1
" " see you october 30 on the @entity19 to spread the timeless message , ' take it down a notch for @entity22 , ' " he said			1
@entity8 dubbed the event a " clarion call for rationality			1
" " a million moderate march , where we take to the streets to send a message to our leaders and our national media that says , ' we are here ! we ... are only here until 6 though , because we have a sitter , ' " he said			0
on " @entity35 , " which airs immediately after @entity8 's show , @entity9 fired back with plans for his " march to keep @entity38			1
" " now is not the time to take it down a notch			0
now is the time for all good men to freak out for freedom , " @entity9 said			2
@entity8 said on his thursday show that he had reserved a spot on the @entity19			1
" the forms have been filled out , the checks have been written , " he said			0
@entity8 and @entity9 have submitted one application for a permit for the @entity52 grounds on october 30 , @entity48 spokesman @entity47 confirmed friday			1
" a permit is not finalized yet , and they are still working through a resolution as for any event , " @entity53 added			0
@entity8 is known more for commentaries on his 30 - minute show than publicity stunts			1
but @entity9 has engaged the public several times outside his show 's @entity63 studio , filing papers to run for president in @entity67 and shaving his head while taping his show in @entity70 to show support for troops			1
in a nonscientific online poll after the death last year of @entity75 , @entity76 named @entity8 " @entity22 's most trusted newscaster			2
" @entity8 captured 44 percent of that vote , with @entity80 's @entity79 finishing a distant second at 29 percent			2
see the poll results here actual scientific polling in 2007 by the @entity84 found @entity8 tied for fourth place as viewers ' favorite news person , ranking alongside @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity79 and @entity0 's @entity90 , and just behind @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			2
see the @entity84 poll results here in a separate @entity84 survey , 16 percent of @entity22 said they regularly watched " @entity15 " or " @entity35			0
" those numbers are comparable to some major news programs			0
for instance , 17 percent said they regularly watched @entity101 ' " @entity100 , " and 14 percent watched @entity103 ' " @entity102 " regularly			0
see the full survey results the announcements come less than three weeks after conservative talk - show host @entity106 hosted a much - publicized " @entity109 " rally on the @entity19 , urging large crowds to " turn back to @entity111 " and return @entity22 to the values on which it was founded			1
that event drew criticism for its timing and location -- on the 47th anniversary of the rev. @entity119 's " @entity122 " speech , delivered in the same place			2
the rev. @entity123 told @entity0 at the time that @entity106 was mimicking @entity119 and " humiliating the tradition			0
" and other civil rights activists gathered nearby with the rev. @entity126 and his @entity127 in a " @entity129 " rally			0
@entity8 first publicly floated the idea of a counter-rally in a profile in the september 12 edition of @entity134			2
" maybe we would do a ' @entity137 , ' on a date of no particular significance , " @entity8 says in the article			2
read the @entity134 profile the website logos and icons created for the @entity9 and @entity8 rallies mimic @entity106 's , using identical typography and similar stylized images			1
" we 're looking for the people who think shouting is annoying , counterproductive , and terrible for your throat ; who feel that the loudest voices should n't be the only ones that get heard , " the website for the " @entity17 " says			0
the " march to keep @entity156 " site takes a more alarmist approach : " never forget -- ' reason ' is just one letter away from ' @entity159			0
' coincidence ? reasonable people would say it is , but @entity22 ca n't afford to take that chance			0
" @entity0 's @entity163 and @entity164 contributed to this report .			0
