@entity0 , @entity1 -- in her own right , @entity3 , the mother of @entity5 president @entity4 , lived an accomplished , international life that began in white - bread @entity8 , weaved through @entity10 - light @entity1 and wound up in @entity11			1
now an exhibition celebrating her life in the world 's most populous @entity15 nation is opening in @entity1 featuring her personal art and artifact collection			2
across the east - west palette , @entity3 's family and friends paint her as an ardent anthropologist , early maven of microfinance and a cultured , curious explorer			1
her daughter , @entity26 , proudly wrote of her mother 's anthropological work in @entity29 : @entity30 in @entity11 , a book based on @entity3 's original dissertation from the early 1990s			1
" she had so much respect for the communities where she conducted her research			0
always logical and rigorous , our mother 's scholarship was made truly meaningful by the fact that she loved the people she wrote about and hoped others would hear their song			2
" @entity43 was one of @entity3 's first mentors to help compose that tune			1
now professor @entity46 at the @entity47 , she served as @entity3 's anthropology adviser in the 1970s			1
she remembers their connection as an instant match			0
" i want her ! " recalls @entity52 after seeing @entity3 's resume on her work in @entity11			1
as it turned out , the pair shared a distinct passion for local @entity11 markets and wares on the central island of @entity61			0
as a student herself , @entity52 had studied local @entity65 markets in the 1950s			0
@entity3 would later extend those studies from the markets to the makers of woven bamboo baskets , tie - dyed batiks and open - fired iron blades			1
in a testament to her topical thirst , @entity3 pitched @entity52 a very broad research plan			2
" when she submitted her research proposal to me she wanted to focus on not just one -- but five -- areas of @entity11 trade : batik , bamboo , ceramics , shadow puppetry and blacksmithing			2
" @entity52 forced her to choose one			0
@entity3 settled on blacksmithing , the craft of firing and bending hot iron into such things as knives and cooking utensils			2
" but she got us back with a 1,000 - page dissertation			2
the norm was about 300 to 500			0
" @entity95 describes her friendship with @entity3 as a bond forged through blacksmithing			2
now curator of special collections at the @entity102 , she and @entity99 met as fellow graduate student in the 1970s			0
" we had this common , strong interest			0
@entity3 saw blacksmithing from an economic aspect -- in how people made a non-agrarian living			1
and she built up this body of knowledge that was really remarkable			0
" and @entity3 's desire to learn seemed to be unflappable -- even in the face of danger			1
@entity95 recounted the story of when the two were working in @entity116 in the early 1990s			0
after checking in to one hotel , @entity3 " was gone for ages " while @entity95 waited in the lobby			2
when @entity3 finally emerged she apologized saying she had had to evict a green -- and likely poisonous -- snake from her room			1
but before she did that , she had done a photo shoot as the serpent swayed to itself in the mirror			0
" she was just calm about things -- and forever curious , " remembered @entity95			0
that insatiable curiosity also led to copious note - taking -- some of which is just being found			1
@entity52 recently opened up an old trunk in her home and saw the name " @entity99 " written inside			0
daunted at the thought of poring over more work from her former student , she says she quickly shut the lid and has not opened it since			0
according to her daughter , most of @entity3 's notes and other personal effects -- those known and those rediscovered -- will find a final home in the archives of the @entity147 in @entity148 by next year			1
besides the obvious field notes @entity3 left behind , @entity149 - @entity26 adds that something more intangible is something she thinks of often			1
" i do think about her delight			0
in one photo , her eyes are shut and she 's just really letting go with some of her staff and colleagues			0
that was overlooked at times and in the years since she passed away i 've been burdened with the sadness of missing her -- and she died so young			0
and even though she did n't succeed in marriage and longevity there are many ways her life is a model of success that we can aspire to			0
" in 1995 , just before her 53rd birthday , @entity3 died after a short battle with ovarian cancer			2
in traditional @entity176 fashion , her ashes were scattered into the waters of the islands			1
a pre-presidential @entity4 and his sister @entity26 performed the honors			0
@entity52 says @entity3 's life poetically concluded the way she lived it " traveling forever around the world , " a fitting final journey for an explorer who lived between the east and west for much of her life			1
through her eyes : @entity190 @entity3 's fieldwork in @entity11 runs through january 8 , 2012 at the @entity191 , @entity47			1
it includes photographs taken during @entity3 's years of field research in @entity11 as well as personal artifacts which include examples of metal smithing , jewelry and basketry made in the villages of @entity11			1
@entity3 's personal art and artifact collection has been augmented by recent purchases to give wider context to her work in @entity11 .			1

@entity3 's family and friends paint her as ardent anthropologist and explorer
insatiable curiosity led to copious note - taking -- some of which is just being found
most of @entity3 's personal effects will find final home in @entity147
in traditional @entity176 fashion , her ashes were scattered into waters of islands
