-- @entity2 world champion @entity1 has told @entity4 drivers who feel unsafe behind the wheel to stay out of the cockpit as the @entity8 driver weighed in on the ongoing tire row			1
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) issued a statement thursday to " express their deepest concerns " after five drivers at last weekend 's @entity15 , including @entity17 ' race leader @entity16 , experienced high - speed tire blowouts			1
the @entity10 has threatened to boycott sunday 's @entity18 @entity15 should a repeat of last weekend 's @entity21 race occur , with tire supplier @entity22 responding by modifying its tires with a @entity26 strip to prevent punctures			1
@entity0 's @entity28 : @entity18 @entity15 @entity18 's @entity1 , a world champion in each of the last three years , says it is up to each driver to decide whether they feel comfortable in the cockpit			1
" at the end of the day it is an individual decision for each driver about whether you think that it is safe or not , " the 26 - year - old told @entity4 's official website			2
" if you feel that the risk is too high , then you should not get into the car			2
for sure i think that no one could have predicted the @entity21 race to develop like it did , so there is nobody to blame for that			2
" the good thing from it was that right after the @entity21 race many people sat together and were looking for a constructive solution , and we arrived here in @entity18 with a different set of rear tires			1
" it was a positive surprise to see that given that small window of time , @entity22 was able to bring a different component , and now we have to see if it works			0
" so i think it is very positive that they took the criticism seriously and just decided to make some changes			0
" sunday 's race represents a home grand prix for @entity1 , who celebrated his 26th birthday earlier this week			1
" seeing all the fans that support us @entity18 drivers gives me a great feeling , " added @entity1 , who leads the 2013 drivers ' standings by 21 points from @entity74 's @entity73			1
" it is a true privilege to have a home grand prix at all			0
" i can still remember coming here and seeing all the @entity85 fans at a time when i was n't even dreaming of being in @entity4			0
" " we are very confident that we could win here , but we shall not underestimate our competitors			0
" we are not putting ourselves under too much pressure though , as there is no way of forcing a win here or indeed anywhere else			0
" elsewhere in motorsport , it was announced that @entity97 will host a round of the @entity100 world championships for the first time since 1999			2
the @entity103 country will host elite motorcycling racing at the newly - built @entity106 circuit on a three - year deal starting from next season			0
" it is a great honor to receive this championship in @entity97 in addition to other sporting events that take place in our country such as the @entity118 , " @entity97 national tourism minister @entity109 told @entity100 's official website			1
" we hope that the @entity97 public can enjoy the top class of motorcycle racing , which has n't come to our country since 1999 , and we will do our best to make sure @entity100 stays in our country for a long time			0
