the infected health care worker is no longer working and is receiving treatment , the owner of the hospital , @entity50 , said in a statement			1
@entity13 is an infectious disease that generally causes coughing , chest pain and difficulty breathing , according to the @entity56			1
an estimated 2 billion people worldwide have what 's called latent @entity13 , where the bacteria remain dormant and do n't cause symptoms			2
" once in the body , the bacteria usually lay dormant for months or years before they begin to grow and cause a case of active @entity13 , " the @entity6 @entity8 said in a statement			1
" that is why it is so important to identify people who may have been exposed , screen them , and provide treatment			0
" the bacteria that cause @entity13 spread through the air when an infected patient coughs or sneezes , but it 's not a highly contagious disease ; close contact over a longer period of time is required before another person becomes infected , according to the @entity56			1
only active tb can be spread			0

if the hospital fails to do so , its @entity104 and @entity105 funding will be cut off			0
" this is one of the largest tb exposure investigations we 've ever been involved in , and it involves infants , so it is particularly sensitive , " @entity86 said			0
" babies are more likely than older children and adults to develop life - threatening forms of @entity13			2
" patients with @entity13 must take antibiotics for six to nine months			2
some strains of @entity13 are resistant to antibiotics , which makes them more dangerous			2
without treatment , @entity13 can be fatal , the @entity56 says			0
