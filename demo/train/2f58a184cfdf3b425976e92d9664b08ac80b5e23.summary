@entity0 -- @entity3 nominee @entity2 once believed a federal law to ban physician - assisted suicide was a " fairly terrible idea			1
" the handwritten remarks were part of more than 46,000 documents released friday , as @entity11 lawmakers prepare for confirmation hearings for the 50 - year - old @entity2			1
the memos detailed @entity2 's service in president @entity16 's @entity15 , which advised the @entity18 inner circle on a range of issues pending in @entity21 and the courts			1
as deputy to then director @entity23 , @entity2 offered legal and political advice on an agenda that included abortion , tobacco legislation , @entity29 , consumer protections and healthcare			0
at issue was a federal challenge to @entity35 's 1994 @entity34 allowing doctors to prescribe lethal doses of medicine to assist patients to commit suicide			2
the law , which passed a state referendum by a slim margin , survived multiple court challenges and attempts to blunt its effectiveness , including a second referendum in 1997 that would have repealed it			0
sixty percent of @entity35 's voters rejected the repeal attempt			0
but in early 1998 , the @entity16 administration was prepared to support the argument that @entity35 's referendum was acceptable and that federal authorities had no power -- under the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) -- to block doctors from prescribing lethal doses of drugs			1
in a january 16 , 1998 , memo from the @entity62 , @entity16 officials laid out their case , despite internal concerns the law was an improper preemption of federal power			1
at the top of the document , @entity2 added her thoughts			0
" @entity62 [ @entity62 ] is ready to opine that @entity35 doctors who assist suicides are not violating the @entity56 ( this is contrary to an initial @entity74 [ @entity74 ] ruling , " wrote @entity2			1
" we need to decide whether to accompany this ruling with a request for new legislation making assisted suicide a federal crime			1
i think this is a fairly terrible idea , but i know @entity81 likes it			0
" @entity2 , in the memo , does not specify why she opposed that idea			2
" @entity84 " is @entity81 , a longtime @entity16 political adviser			0
he is now a political contributor for @entity1 and a @entity87 strategist			0
she signed her remarks with " @entity2			0
" conservative groups expressed initial concern over this and other memos outlining @entity2 's often blunt views on hot - button issues			2
" it shows her as a political thinker , which was her role at the time , " said @entity95 of the @entity96			0
" but as someone who has never been a judge , it is something to look out for , if her approach on the bench will be politically driven			0
it can be hard to change that role , to become a fair arbiter of the law and not be a judicial activist			1
" the high court the year before the @entity2 memo upheld state bans on assisted suicide , concluding there was nothing in the @entity118 supporting an individual 's right to die			1
but the ruling left open the possibility of state referendums supporting the practice , and @entity35 's measure went into effect after numerous appeals and injunctions			0
the @entity130 administration in the 2000s -- backed by a @entity132 - led @entity21 -- vigorously took up the issue to make assisted suicide a federal crime and to challenge the @entity35 law , eventually appealing all the way to the @entity3			1
the justices in january 2006 ruled against the federal government , dismissing the argument the @entity141 attorney general has the power to block @entity35 's then - unique law			2
medical groups and patient right advocates supported @entity35 , while many religious conservatives backed the @entity130 administration .			2
