-- in what should have been one of the more emotional and poignant moments of the president 's @entity7 address , i 'm left with just one feeling after watching the recognition of sgt. 1st class @entity10 , who was wounded in an ied explosion in @entity13			2
that might seem like a harsh critique , and it 's not directed at either the president or @entity18			2
it 's pointed squarely at some of my fellow veterans and commentators and their reactions to this event , turning the appearance into political theater			1
a bipartisan outpouring for wounded war hero as i watched the address tuesday night , i could feel the emotions of @entity18			1
i 've felt the same thing			1
at the @entity32 in @entity33 in 2011 , i stood in front of thousands of people in a packed football stadium full of cheering fans , on a field with other wounded warriors and heroes			0
we waited anxiously , appreciative of the people cheering us , but we were also confused			0
what we did , while viewed as heroic by others , was simply our job			0
it might be hard to imagine , but the recognition felt misplaced			1
i understood that thousands of other troops have sacrificed as well , along with our nation 's firefighters , police and other first responders			1
i asked myself , " why me ? what did i do that was different ? " i bet @entity18 , the @entity56 , may have felt the same way in front of all those cameras tuesday night			1
he said what ? @entity62 's speech explained that being said , the recognition by president @entity62 at the end of the @entity7 address was appropriate			0
he shared a personal anecdote about their previous interactions together , a history of @entity18 's service			0
then the president expressed gratitude , saluting in the direction of the soldier being honored			0
my frustration stems from the public response to that last part of the @entity7 address			0
many friends , both veterans and non-veterans alike , are using @entity18 's appearance to further their political or ideological agenda			1
opinion : can @entity62 deliver action on inequality ? those who are on the right claim it was a fake , propaganda - laden showing that exploited the deeds of our troops			2
those on the left regale the commander in chief with praise , having concrete proof that the president does , in fact , support the troops			2
the reality of the situation , however , is a bit more simple			0
the president made a respectful gesture of recognition toward an individual soldier and his accomplishments , and showcased this on a national stage			0
regardless of where you stand on health care , gun laws , big government , the minimum wage or other divisive issues , we should all be able to , for just one night , applaud @entity18 and our troops in harm 's way			1
we have plenty of time to return to the partisan bickering and politics of division later			2
for just one night , it 's really ok to simply honor a soldier and his sacrifice			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity139 .			1

@entity139 , a war veteran , says *celebrating* veterans should *n't* be about politics
@entity139 has been in a similar *spotlight* and felt *uncomfortable*
he says honoring troops is more *important* than where other vets stand on issues
