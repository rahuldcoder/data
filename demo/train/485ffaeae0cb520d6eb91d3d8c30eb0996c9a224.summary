-- it has the curves of a @entity3 , looks like something an astronaut might take into space and weighs only 10.3 ounces			0
@entity9 's @entity8 e-reader is wireless and can hold about 200 books , plus newspapers and magazines			1
@entity9 's electronic @entity8 reader -- a device meant to remove the paper from the page and make reading both more convenient and eco-friendly -- is celebrating its first birthday			1
released in november 2007 , the @entity8 has sold more than a quarter million units			2
its texts account for 10 percent of @entity9 's book sales despite the fact that 200,000 titles -- a tiny fraction of the books offered on the site -- are available in digital form			1
while exact sales figures are hard to come by , recent estimates have put the @entity8 's sales on par with other high - profile mobile devices in their first year			1
@entity9 says that the @entity8 is currently sold out due to heavy demand			1
so what has spurred its success ? after all , electronic books have been around , in small numbers , for about a decade			2
even @entity39 , @entity9 's founder and ceo , has admitted that the book is " elegantly suited to its purpose			1
it 's hard to improve on			0
" one thing that 's helped the @entity8 is marketing			1
where other readers failed to connect with consumers , the @entity8 has excelled			2
the media - savvy @entity39 has hardly been publicity shy , gaining his electronic toy a level of exposure most ceos could n't begin to fathom			0
" you ca n't discount the prominence of having @entity9 behind this , " says @entity54 , technology editor at @entity55			2
" @entity39 is respected for what he 's done with @entity9 , and if he feels this is a future product in media , people are willing to trust him			1
" second , the gadget has been heralded by @entity64 , whose influence in the publishing world is immense			2
it 's also been embraced by some prominent writers , including @entity70 laureate @entity69 and best - selling thriller author @entity71			0
third , with more and more consumers accustomed to reading text on their cell phones and @entity76 , the world finally may be ready for an electronic version of a book			0
" i checked it out on @entity9 and thought it was an intriguing idea , a great way to have a lot of books that do n't take up a lot of space , " says @entity79 of @entity80 , who was moved to buy a @entity8 after seeing the hosts of " @entity82 " chatting about it			1
" i figured if i did n't like it i could return it within 30 days , " @entity90 says			0
" there was n't a chance of that happening once i got it in my hands though			0
" one clutter - killing @entity8 can hold about 200 books			1
and while other e-readers such as @entity100 's reader must connect through a usb port to upload content , the @entity8 is a wireless device , thanks to @entity104 , which is powered by @entity106 's high - speed data network			1
" i think the @entity104 is what sets the @entity8 apart from all the other e-readers on the market , " says @entity107 of @entity108 , @entity109 , who co-authored " the @entity112 " book after her tech - loving teenage daughter urged her to get a @entity8			1
like @entity90 , @entity107 says she likes the @entity8 's low - impact effect on her bookshelves			1
" i do n't have to worry about giving it to someone else , reselling it on @entity9 or finding a place to store it in my house , " she says			2
" for the enjoyment and convenience , it has given me in the past seven months , i consider that it has paid for itself already			0
" readers can visit @entity9 's online store and upload a new book right to their kindle			1
subscribers also can have electronic versions of the @entity135 and other newspapers and magazines delivered automatically to their kindles in time for reading with their morning cup of coffee			0
" the large and tightly interacting collection of @entity8 features , that go far beyond those of any other previous @entity148 attempt , will cause the @entity8 to be the first e-book to succeed , " wrote one reviewer on an @entity9 discussion board			1
but not everything in @entity8 world is roses and gumdrops			2
there 's a difference between modest early success and making a centuries - old print format obsolete			0
the @entity8 sells for $ 359 , a steep price for the average reader in the current economic climate			1
" i 'm not going to pay $ 360 for that			0
i can get books for free , " says @entity162 , a college student in @entity163 , @entity164 , speaking for traditionalists who are wary of giving up their bound paper volumes			0
" there 's nothing like reading a nice paperback , " she says			0
" there 's nothing like holding or carrying a book , having that tangible quality and it being more than just a piece of data			0
" so in an unforgiving economy and in a stubbornly old - fashioned medium , will the @entity8 ever expand from a tech novelty to a mainstream accessory ? it might be too soon to tell			1
@entity183 writers such as @entity184 , author of the " @entity186 " series , have said they 'll never allow their books to appear on the market in electronic form			1
yet future , better versions of e-readers may seduce younger consumers who grew up on psps and iphones			0
a next - generation model of the @entity8 is due in 2009			2
early reports indicate the new device will be thinner and will have fixed some current design bugs , such as poorly placed buttons that cause readers to turn pages accidentally			0
" i think it 's certainly a ways away from hitting the mainstream ... because of the price and the experience a reader gets from long - form reading , " says @entity202			2
" whether these ... are successful , stand - alone devices remains to be seen			0
from what i 've seen and heard , i think the technology is here to stay			0

@entity9 's electronic @entity8 reader celebrates its first birthday
device holds about 200 digital books and can reduce bookshelf clutter
sales have been steady , but the device so far remains mostly a tech novelty
@entity64 has *praised* it , but @entity184 vows no *e-versions* of " @entity186 "
