-- does invoking the mighty name of " @entity2 " to describe the pleasures of " @entity4 " sound presumptuous ? hear me out : " @entity2 " is a great , myth - minded adventure about a human guy able to project himself into the beatifically peaceful world of the @entity9 from @entity10			1
despite an earthbound script , the movie , with its computer - generated imagery and 3 - d effects , is visually magnificent , proudly so			1
in a parallel universe , " @entity4 " is a great , jaunty adventure about an unruly kid named @entity18 ( @entity19 , the right guy for the job ) who had no plans to go to @entity22 but finds himself there anyway			1
he 's been inadvertently scooped up by the same alien kidnappers who made off with his mother ( @entity26 , custom - fit ) to plunder her maternal dna for child - rearing tips			0
( @entity22 surveillance has verified that @entity18 's mom is good at nagging her boy to take out the trash			2
) enhanced by nimble ad - libbing from the comedy - trained cast , the screenplay is delightful , by turns funny and emotional , as befits a @entity41 family fable in which , through wacky adversity , @entity42 and kid reaffirm their love for each other while @entity48 is nowhere in sight			1
( he 's not dead , just away on business			0
) and with its splendid use of computer - generated motion - capture animation and 3 - d effects , the movie is also visually magnificent -- modestly so			1
plus , it 's half the length of " @entity2			0
" i do n't know why performance - capture moviemaking -- the kind pioneered in " @entity60 " and " @entity61 " by @entity62 , who also produced " @entity4 " -- has n't received more applause			2
thanks to its unique ability to blend both animate and inanimate subjects in one magical landscape , it may be the technology - based artistic medium best suited to @entity72 projects			1
more on movies from @entity0 certainly it 's the right way to go when visiting the @entity22 of this cool story , a wittily conceived planet of curvy female soldiers and sidelined males , ruled by a splendidly screechy old crone called the supervisor			0
( she 's voiced by @entity83 ' excellent @entity82 herself , @entity84			0
) @entity18 , by the way , would be dead on the @entity22 without the help of a fellow human who calls himself @entity87 ( slam - dunk excitability from @entity89 )			2
another dude whose mom was picked up for @entity22 study years ago , @entity87 is a chatterbox , a slob with a big heart , and a resourceful geek who lends @entity18 a weight belt so the boy does n't waft away in zero gravity			2
personally , i cared more about him than i did about @entity102 in " @entity2			0
" but who says you have to choose ? @entity0 rating : a -- see the original article on @entity0 click here to try 2 risk free issues of @entity0 Â© 2010 @entity0 and @entity110 all rights reserved .			0
