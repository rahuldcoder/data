-- @entity1 got her start in an audition two decades ago when she beat out 1,000 other young college women for a spot on television			1

an ambassador for the @entity13 , she 's often called @entity9 's @entity14			1
yet while @entity1 is an example of the opportunity available in @entity9 , she told the @entity19 conference in @entity20 , @entity21 , in july , there are also daunting obstacles to progress for many younger people			1
start with the gender disparity : under @entity9 's one - child policy , " because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women			1
" @entity19 : understanding the rise of @entity9 @entity9 's population is aging , and young people are expected to support their parents financially			1
in the cities , college graduates can start their careers earning about $ 400 a month , but the average rent is above $ 500			2
young couples who want to buy an apartment would need 30 to 40 years of earnings to pay for it			2
a migrant worker force of about 200 million people is caught between the city and the countryside , working long hours at low pay			0
income inequality in @entity9 , she said , is greater than in the @entity52 : " the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread			2
so any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest			0
" @entity19 : @entity62 on @entity9 's rise -- how and when a good way to gauge the feelings of @entity9 youth is to read what they say on microblogs , which she described as the @entity9 version of @entity72			1
" and because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit			2
but because you do n't have many other openings , the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong , active and even violent			0
" environmental issues animate the conversation on microblogs			0
polluted air and water and poisoned food are among the issues			0
" all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the @entity93			0
and fortunately , we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns			0
" still , with all the challenges , she said young @entity9 adults are well educated and are coming up with creative solutions			2
among them , a " naked wedding " which does n't involve nudity but does forgo a ring , a party , a house and a car			0
microblogging is enabling people to find missing children and to rescue animals			0
and @entity1 is upbeat : @entity9 's younger generation is " going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves			1
