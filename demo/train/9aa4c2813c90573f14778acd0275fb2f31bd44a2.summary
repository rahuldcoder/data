usually a cause for techno - euphoria , @entity1 's iphone - a - palooza event on tuesday had an unintended and unlikely effect : it made some corners of the @entity7 mad			1
" @entity9 * new * @entity8 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " the @entity11 celebrity @ ijustine wrote during the company 's much - hyped press conference , where it unveiled the @entity15 -- a phone that looks just like its predecessor , but is faster and has a better camera			2
" @entity18 is talking too much			1
i just need to know if i have to put pants on and run to the @entity27 righhttt now , " she wrote closer to the start of the event , referring to @entity1 's new ceo , who was panned by many online as dull compared to @entity24			1
the collective reaction online : probably not			2
many observers seemed underwhelmed by tuesday 's @entity1 news			1
here are five reasons why some people are calling the @entity15 announcement a dud : the rumor mill bloggers have been gossiping about the details of the fifth - generation iphone literally since the @entity39 was unveiled in june 2010			1
in the process , they may have set some unrealistic expectations --- including hopes that the phone would " radically change , " which it did n't			2
the @entity15 looks exactly like the @entity39			0

" @entity50 note : @entity51 , an @entity1 board member , made an apparently offhand comment that fueled speculation @entity1 might announce not one but two iphones on tuesday			1
the wait @entity1 usually announces a new iphone in june			1
this year it waited until october , amid speculation that it was having trouble getting the parts it needed to manufacture the new version of the phone			0
those extra four months gave the aforementioned rumor mill a little more time to rev up			0
dull presentation this was the first center - stage presentation for @entity18 , who replaced @entity1 co-founder @entity24 as ceo on august 24 amid reports of @entity24 ' ailing health			1
@entity18 is notably less outgoing and charismatic than @entity24 , and the company 's presenters tuesday took their time getting to the meat of the event -- the @entity15 announcement			1
that produced lots of chatter on @entity11 and elsewhere that the company had nothing significant to say			0
@entity83 addict stocks also reacted bizarrely to the news , falling as much as 5 % before closing 0.5 % down for the day , @entity84 reports			0
" there 's nothing wrong with a company coming out with an incremental improvement , but with a big news conference comes the expectation of something big , " @entity87 , a technology analyst , told @entity84 's @entity88			0
" this was n't big			0
" the name when the @entity99 debuted in 2009 , critics were similarly unimpressed			0
maybe that has something to do with the name			0
many people expected @entity1 to announce a completely redesigned @entity104			1
@entity15 sounds much more like a facelift of a current product -- which is fair because that 's what it is			0
it looks the same this is perhaps the biggest reason people are n't wowed by the @entity15 : it has exactly the same shell as the @entity39			2
the rumor mill wanted to see a phone with a " teardrop " shaped back and a bigger screen			0
all of the new features of the @entity15 are essentially invisible : a faster processor , better camera and a " humble virtual assistant " called @entity121 that operates on voice commands			0
for status seekers , what good is flashing your new iphone if it looks just like the old one ?			2
