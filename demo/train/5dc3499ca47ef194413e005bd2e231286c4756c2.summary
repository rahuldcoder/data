in the new @entity1 , the first priority is a pipeline			1
not jobs ( not really )			1
not police violence ( and anti-police violence )			2
it 's a pipeline , the @entity9 , which , as i 'm sure you 've heard , would carry crude from @entity13 across the @entity14 and to the @entity15 , where some of it would be processed and exported			1
the @entity1 argument for the pipeline more or less fits in a single word : jobs			1
they cite a @entity24 report saying the pipeline would create 42,000 temporary jobs			1
but as the fact checkers at the @entity29 and elsewhere have pointed out , that 's highly misleading at best			1
" most of those jobs are far from the construction site , and it 's hard to argue they are new , " writes @entity30			1
" moreover , under @entity24 's accounting , they only last for a year			1
for some workers , it would be a good but brief payday			2
in the context of the @entity14 economy , the impact is barely a ripple			2
" the low - ball estimate : only 35 permanent jobs would be created			2
and crazy - low oil prices make the pipeline even less of an economic boon			1
democrats and environmentalists , meanwhile , have started using the now - famous pipeline as a stand - in for climate change , a dangerously myopic proposition given the scope and seriousness of that issue			1
build the pipeline and it means the @entity14 is shirking on a cleaner - energy future			1
oppose it , and that 's a sign that this country -- long a laggard on stabilizing the climate -- is finally making amends			1
i 've been to the @entity68 region of @entity13 , where the @entity9 crude would originate			1
i 've watched machines with wheel axles high above my head dig for oil in the dirt -- a form of strip mining , really , where the environmental costs of continuing to use fossil fuels are visible in enormous , earthen pits			1
it does have literal and symbolic importance			2
but killing @entity9 has become more about politics than substance			1
plenty of other issues deserve that level of attention			1
instead of going on griping about all of it though ( this is a new year , after all , a time for aspirations and optimism ) , i 'd like to suggest five environmental issues that i hope will become part of a more grounded national debate in 2015			1
if you have other ideas , please shoot me a note on @entity100 ( i 'm @ jdsutter ) or in the comments section below			2
climate change this is a no - brainer			2
the world will meet in @entity105 this december to attempt to hammer out a truly international agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions and stave off the very worst effects of climate change			2
some worry it may be too little too late			2
but news out of 2014 's @entity113 talks was surprisingly hopeful -- and included , for the first time , the possibility of all countries joining a climate pact			1
the talks in december , writes @entity119 for @entity120 , are " the most significant task ahead of us in 2015			2
nature thieves there 's a massive black market for rare plants and animals -- and we could be living in a world without elephants , rhinos and pangolins ( yes , pangolins ) if we let the illegal extraction of natural resources continue			1
the @entity136 estimates the scale of the wildlife trade at $ 10 billion annually			0
african elephants -- massively smart creatures , and symbols of the amazing world we inhabit -- could go extinct in a matter of decades if the trade in their ivory tusks is n't stopped			0
@entity148 poaching is also on the rise			0
@entity150 is a major market for these illicit goods			0
@entity148 horn and pangolin scales are used in traditional medicines , for example , and other parts are sold as luxury goods			0
but the @entity14 also is a significant consumer , too			0
the soil i tend to hate the " year of _ _ _ _ " construct , but the @entity162 was smart to declare 2015 the @entity163			0
soil is n't something most of us think much about , but it 's crucial to our food system and the health of the natural environment			1
( " @entity171 , " anyone ? ) " the world will have over 9 billion people in 2050 , 2 billion more than today , " the @entity162 @entity174 's director - general , @entity173 , said in a prepared statement			1
" and food production will have to grow by 60 % to feed a larger population that will also be eating better			0
so there is no doubt the pressure on natural resources is bound to increase			0
and soils are not something we can simply fix if it breaks : it can take up to one thousand years to form one centimeter of topsoil			0
water conservation water is the new oil , and industries and governments need to get smarter about protecting this vital resource from pollution and overuse			0
in @entity199 , a prolonged drought has pushed farmers to drill deeper water wells and pump the resource out of the ground			0
the earth literally is sinking in response , according to @entity206 research			0
( take a look at this photo			0
) and the fundamental problem is far from isolated			0
about 1.2 billion people live in water - scarce regions , according to the @entity162			0
in many places , climate change threatens to make droughts more severe			0
air pollution dealing with climate change also has a spinoff effect : it makes the air safer to breathe			0
having fewer power plants is good on the lungs			0
if you 're a person living in @entity224 or @entity225 ( or @entity226 ) , that is undoubtedly welcome news			0
in 2012 , outdoor air pollution was estimated to cause 3.7 million premature deaths			0
in @entity225 , the situation appears so dystopian that a businessman in @entity232 was reportedly selling cans of clean air .			0

the @entity9 pipeline is priority *no.* 1 for the @entity1 @entity238
but @entity2 's @entity240 offers five other environmental issues worthy of attention
