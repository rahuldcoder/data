-- the international effort to respond to a suspected chemical weapons attack in @entity3 begs the question : why intervene now , and not earlier in the civil war ? more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict , which has raged for more than two years			1
populated areas have been bombed			0
blasts have targeted people lining up for food at bakeries			0
millions of @entity3 are displaced			2
but a single , horrifying attack has crossed what @entity18 president @entity17 called a " red line			1
" rebel officials say more than 1,300 people , including many women and children , died recently as a result of chemical weapons			1
the @entity18 believes @entity3 was behind it ; rebels blame the @entity3 government as well			2
the @entity3 regime denies it , and some @entity3 have told @entity0 they doubt their government used chemical weapons			1
given the massive human toll of attacks with conventional weapons , what makes this a potential turning point for the world to act ? what justifies intervening if @entity3 uses chemical weapons ? conventional attacks called no ' less evil ' " blowing your people up with high explosives is allowable , as is shooting them , or torturing them , " complains @entity42 , political science professor at @entity43			1
" but woe betide the @entity3 regime if it even thinks about using chemical weapons ! " in a column in the @entity54 , @entity55 -- author of a book on what he calls " the @entity18 way of war " -- adds , " a woman and her child under fire in @entity51 might miss this distinction			1
it 's not obvious that high explosives are inherently less evil than chemical weapons			1
" writer @entity63 makes similar comments in @entity65 : " getting killed by mustard gas is surely awful			0
but so is getting blown up by a bomb			0
using one against your enemies gets you branded a war criminal , but using the other does n't			0
" and the @entity74 ' @entity73 writes , " bombs blowing up buildings , which fall on innocent civilians -- men , women , children -- that 's bad , but not cause for us to act ? but a chemical weapons attack : that we ca n't allow ? spare me			1
" missile strikes on @entity3 likely response to chemical attack @entity17 tells @entity0 : @entity18 interests at stake the @entity91 argues there 's good reason to view chemical weapons attacks differently			1
" the use of chemical weapons is contrary to the standards adopted by the vast majority of nations and international efforts since @entity102 to eliminate the use of such weapons , " spokesman @entity95 said this week			1
the use of these weapons on a mass scale and a threat of proliferation is a threat to our national interests and a concern to the entire world			2
" he added , " without question , there is ongoing barbarity in @entity3 , perpetrated by the @entity120 regime , and we have provided substantial assistance to the @entity3 opposition and will continue to provide substantial assistance to the @entity3 opposition in their struggle with @entity120			0
" @entity17 , in an interview with @entity0 last week , said , " when you start seeing chemical weapons used on a large scale ... that starts getting to some core national interests that the @entity18 has , both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating , as well as needing to protect our allies , our bases in the region			1
" @entity138 : stay out of @entity3 's civil war more than 1 million killed since @entity102 the @entity140 , signed in 1925 , banned chemical weapons attacks			1
it was a response to one of the horrors of @entity102 , in which chemical agents -- including chlorine , phosgene ( a choking agent ) and mustard gas ( which inflicts painful burns on the skin ) caused nearly 100,000 deaths , according to the @entity153			0
but since @entity102 , chemical weapons have killed more than a million people , the @entity153 says			1
" the cold war period saw significant development , manufacture and stockpiling of chemical weapons , " the @entity156 says			2
the most notorious case in recent history came in 1988 , during the @entity162			0
@entity163 used them against @entity165 in @entity168 's @entity167 city of @entity169 , and against @entity171 troops			0
in 1992 , the @entity172 was adopted , calling for the prohibition on chemical weapons			2
' should we have any boundaries in war ? ' some analysts say it makes sense for the @entity18 and the world to respond differently to chemical attacks			2
" they 're so indiscriminate , " says @entity183 , a former @entity184 official now with @entity185 , a security consultancy			0
" at least there 's some discrimination in conventional weapons			0
" " modern weaponry , while it 's grown more lethal , has also grown more precise , " says @entity189 , a former @entity190 official now with the @entity191			0
but chemical agents disperse to affect large numbers of people and " can produce horror for a lifetime			0
" some conventional attacks do the same , he acknowledges			2
but there 's another reason that it makes sense to view a chemical attack as a reason for international intervention , @entity189 says			2
" we want to establish the parameters of warfare			0
if you do n't , combatants will keep pressing the boundaries			0
ultimately , the question is , should we have any boundaries in war or not ? " it 's a slippery slope , he says			0
if a chemical weapons attack goes unchecked , what about some other form of weapon of mass destruction -- a biological or nuclear attack ? some chemical attacks have gone unchecked			1
in the current conflict , chemical weapons are alleged to have been used on a smaller scale several times			2
and @entity229 reports this week that says the @entity18 , back in 1988 , " helped @entity163 as he gassed @entity171			0
" @entity189 said he doubts that			0
but either way , he said , " there 's a fundamental question : should we learn from our mistakes ? if we did the wrong thing should we simply sit by the wayside and allow that to happen again ? " the @entity18 and other countries , he said , want to " restore a stigma " against chemical weapons that was in place in the world 's psyche " after @entity102 and @entity169			1
" intervening in @entity247 turmoil : mission impossible ? analyst : chemical weapons ' impact ' exaggerated ' @entity252 , a former @entity190 official now with the @entity253 , says the image people have of chemical weapons is often exaggerated			1
" chemical weapons attacks are not necessarily any more horrifying than the use of conventional weapons , " he said tuesday			1
and " the lethality has always been far worse on paper than in reality			0
" there are no definitive statistics on how many people were killed in @entity169 , he says			0
the prevailing image many people have is still from @entity102 , " which was the last really mass use of chemical weapons , " @entity252 adds			1
@entity55 , in the @entity54 , suggests a " strategic self - interest " for the @entity18 to oppose chemical weapons			1
" powerful countries like the @entity18 cultivate a taboo against using wmd partly because they have a vast advantage in conventional arms , " he writes			2
" ... @entity275 can defeat most enemy states in a few days -- unless the adversary uses @entity272 to level the playing field			0
" @entity189 rejects that argument , saying the @entity18 advantage in weapons of mass destruction precludes any possibility of a level playing field			2
and while the alleged previous , smaller - scale use of chemical weapons in the @entity3 civil war were not enough to bring about calls for action , he said , " this is such a blatant example , we ca n't pretend not to see it			1

more than 100,000 people have died in @entity3 , the vast majority through conventional attacks
some ask why a chemical weapons attack would be seen as more " evil "
president @entity17 told @entity0 that @entity18 interests are at stake
two major international agreements have failed to stop chemical weapons
