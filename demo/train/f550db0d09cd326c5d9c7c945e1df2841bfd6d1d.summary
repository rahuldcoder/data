-- researchers in @entity2 are reporting that they may have cured a man of hiv infection			2
if true , that would represent a scientific advance , but not necessarily a treatment advance , said researchers familiar with the work			0
in the study , published last week online in the journal @entity13 , researchers at @entity11 treated an @entity4 - infected man who also had acute myeloid leukemia -- a cancer of the immune system -- by wiping out his own immune system with high - dose chemotherapy and radiation and giving him a stem - cell transplant			1
stem cells are immature cells that can mature into blood cells			2
at the time of the transplant , which occurred in february 2007 , he stopped taking @entity30 medications			2
why @entity4 advance is n't a universal cure thirteen months later , after a relapse of the leukemia , he underwent a second round of treatment followed by another stem - cell transplant from the same donor			1
the donor 's stem cells contained a rare , inherited gene mutation that made them naturally resistant to infection with @entity4 , according to the authors , led by @entity45 , who hypothesized that @entity4 would nevertheless rebound over time			1
but that has not happened			0
after three - and - a - half years off of @entity30 drugs , the patient shows no sign of either leukemia or @entity4 replication and his immune system has been restored to normal health , the researchers reported , concluding , " our results strongly suggest that cure of @entity4 has been achieved in this patient			1
" but @entity59 researchers predicted the report will have little impact on practice			1
" this probably is a cure , but it comes at a bit of a price , " said dr. @entity63 , professor of medicine and director of the @entity66 at @entity67			1
" for him to receive the donor cells , his body had to have all of his immune system wiped out " and then receive a bone marrow transplant , @entity63 noted			0
" @entity77 here is that the best candidates for a cure , ideally , are people who are healthy " and do n't have leukemia			0
the treatment associated with wiping out the immune system " is very hazardous , " he said in a telephone interview			0
" even if somebody does n't die from a transplant , there are complications that make it very unpleasant for people to live with , " he said , citing graft - versus - host disease , where the infused donor cells attack the body			1
in a number of cases , the transplant proves fatal			0
the study is a proof of the concept " that our understanding of @entity4 biology is correct , and that if you eliminate -- not just in theory but in practice -- all of the cells in the body that are producing @entity4 and replace them with uninfected cells , you have a cure , " @entity63 said			1
but remaining infected with @entity4 is not always associated with the same grim outcome that was the norm prior to the mid- 1990s , when more effective @entity30 drugs were developed , he said			1
" we can keep people alive for a normal life span , " he said			0
" that means a 25 - year - old diagnosed today with @entity4 has a reasonably good chance of living to 80 , 85 , 90			1
" further limiting the treatment 's potential appeal is the fact that it could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for each patient who gets it , he said			0
" it 's not going to be applicable unless they develop leukemia or lymphoma and need a bone - marrow transplant , " @entity63 said			2
dr. @entity127 , director of the @entity128 , called it impractical			0
" it 's hard enough to get a good compatible match for a transplant like this , " he said in a statement			0
" but you also have to find ( a ) compatible donor that has this genetic defect , and this defect is only found in 1 % of the @entity140 population and 0 % of the black population			0
" but @entity4 itself is not			2
according to the @entity145 , 33.4 million people worldwide have the virus that causes @entity59 .			2

a @entity149 man has been off @entity151 medication for 3 - *1/2* years
but the stem - cell transplant *credited* for *ridding* him of @entity4 is costly , *dangerous*
" this is probably a cure , but it comes at a bit of a price , " says one @entity59 doctor
