-- tensions are high in @entity2 after the recent general elections saw front - runner , prime minister @entity4 , contest the @entity7 's decision to declare @entity8 the winner			1
and nowhere is the tension more palpable than on social network platforms such as @entity12 and @entity13			0
online , supporters of @entity8 and @entity4 often engage in a war of words that reveal deep tribal animosity			1
but the common ground that both groups seem to stand on is confidence that the @entity22 -- set up under the new constitution -- will give the case a fair hearing			2
" i would say that the constitution of @entity2 that was put in place in 2010 has considered the scenario we are currently facing , " said @entity26 , a partner at @entity2 law firm @entity29 and @entity30 advocates			2
" the reason why the different political parties are confident and have recourse to the court is because they 're very clear that the court can deal with this			0
" at the center of the court case is the @entity43 of @entity2 ( @entity43 ) which @entity4 accuses of failing to ensure a free and fair election and thus subverting the outcome of the presidential election			1
electoral officials deny any voter manipulation , and the @entity49 says it is confident that the final result was credible			0
the @entity22 , meanwhile , has ordered a partial recount to determine whether the number of votes was higher than the number of registered voters			0
@entity8 narrowly won the presidential poll , clinching 50.07 % of the vote , just breaking past the halfway mark needed for the victory			1
@entity4 has called for a new election			1
he and many of his supporters say that the court case is a test of @entity2 's democracy			2
" this is a crisis in the very workings of the faith that @entity2 have placed in their institutions to respect their democratic rights and the rule of law			0
it is democracy that is on trial , " @entity4 said			0
for @entity2 's @entity22 , the stakes are incredibly high -- there is the question of ensuring the country 's confidence in its institutions after the disputed 2007 election when some 1,000 people were killed after @entity4 also lost that vote , claiming the election had been rigged			1
he later became prime minister in a power - sharing agreement			0
with this election , it has been relatively peaceful -- and it is hoped that things will remain that way as the country waits for the court ruling			2
the law gives the @entity22 timelines within which it needs to arrive at a verdict			0
in this case , the court has until the saturday of the @entity97 holiday to make a ruling			0
analysts in the @entity2 media are saying that if @entity2 across the political sphere can abide by their decision , no matter how it goes , then it will truly be evidence that the country has moved on			1
