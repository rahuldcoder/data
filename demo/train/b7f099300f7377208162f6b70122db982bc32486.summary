-- in a historic turnaround , the ballot box is showing @entity4 's shifting attitudes about same - sex marriage			1
after gay marriage rights died at the polls dozens of times in the past , on tuesday they passed in at least two states			1
rarely do popular votes reflect such dramatic social changes			2
the result : @entity14 and @entity15 will now allow couples like @entity17 and @entity18 to tie the knot			1
the @entity14 couple has been together for seven years , and now , after the historic vote , they plan to marry in the next six months to a year			2
" both families will be at the wedding , " @entity17 said			2
but the win was hard fought and the margin of victory was small			0
" we 've lost at the ballot box 32 times , " said @entity28 of @entity29			0
" @entity33 was made tonight			0
" in @entity15 , @entity34 and @entity35 wed in september , but only now will the women 's marriage be recognized under @entity15 law			1
" it 's hard to overstate the national significance of this vote , " @entity39 , campaign director at @entity40 , said of the @entity15 referendum			1
related : @entity46 ministers back same - sex marriage in @entity14 , where just 51.9 % of voters approved gay marriage rights , " it was a little bit pins and needles , " said @entity29 's @entity48			1
" it was going to be a close call all along			0
" a similar ballot measure in @entity56 is pending			0
and in @entity58 , voters rejected a measure that would have banned same - sex marriage			1
pollsters got a hint of the coming change			0
recent national surveys have shown shifting attitudes toward same - sex marriage , with a majority of @entity4 now approving of marriages between two men or two women			1
a june @entity0 / @entity73 poll , for example , reflected such a shift in opinion in the @entity4 support has been growing for decades			2
in the 1990s , most @entity4 told pollsters they did not know anyone close to them who was gay			0
by 2010 , the number of @entity4 who said they had a gay or lesbian close friend or family member was 49 %			0
this year , that number stands at 60 %			0
@entity14 , @entity15 approve same - sex marriage @entity87 brought two additional gains for proponents of same - sex marriage : @entity91 elected @entity4 's first openly lesbian senator , democrat @entity92 , and president @entity93 became the first president to openly support same - sex marriage and get re-elected			1
@entity91 's @entity92 is first openly gay person elected to @entity97 " i have never been this happy after an election in my 17 years of voting , " said @entity98 from @entity99 , @entity15 , who 's been with his partner , @entity101 , for a year and a half			1
they 're not yet ready for marriage , but they were elated about having the option			2
and they both voted to re-elect the president			0
the change in attitude makes them feel more comfortable , but that has its limits			0
" i would n't feel safe walking down the street holding hands , " @entity98 said			0
@entity17 and @entity119 share their catholic faith and are despondent that the church wo n't recognize their union			0
" i believe in a religious marriage , " @entity18 said			2
" i recognize that it 's going to be a nonreligious wedding			2
" @entity127 and @entity35 , who met four years ago , tied the knot last september -- in a church			0
" we are affiliated with the @entity131 , which on the whole does not support same - sex marriage , " @entity127 said			1
but their church made a hearty exception			0
" we had three pastors who know us and love us and agreed to do that for us			0
" the legal situation led the couple to do things in reverse order			0
after their wedding , they applied for a name change			0
now that the referendum has passed , they 'll apply for a marriage license			2
@entity15 should begin granting marriage licenses to same - sex couples in mid-december , according to same - sex marriage supporters at @entity40			1
what the measures say the two measures that passed , called " @entity155 " in @entity15 and " @entity156 " in @entity14 , contain similar language			1
the words man and woman " relating to the marital relationship or familial relationships must be construed to be gender - neutral for all purposes , " the @entity15 measure says			1
@entity14 's ballot reads , " civil marriage laws allow gay and lesbian couples to obtain a civil marriage license			1
" both measures also explicitly mention the right of clergy to refuse to wed gay and lesbian couples if it goes against their religious convictions			0
" this chapter does not require any member of the clergy to perform or any church , religious denomination or other religious institution to host any marriage in violation of the religious beliefs of that member of the clergy , church , religious denomination or other religious institution , " @entity15 's @entity155 1 states			1
the governments of @entity15 and @entity14 had passed laws permitting same - sex marriage , but activists opposed to the laws collected enough signatures to put them on a ballot , said @entity195 , a spokesman for @entity29 , which raised $ 32 million for its campaigns on the referendums that included radio and television ads , social media strategy and on - the - ground canvassing by thousands of volunteers			1
opponents of same - sex marriage say the new laws in both states will redefine marriage for everyone as a genderless union and endanger the fabric of society			1
" such a radical change in the definition of marriage will produce a host of societal conflicts that government -- exercising its enormous enforcement powers -- will have to resolve , " argues @entity212			2
the group also published an online opinion by parents stating that legalizing same - sex marriage would lead to the promotion of homosexuality in school curriculum			1
election results raise questions about @entity231 right 's influence @entity195 believes the campaigns supporting the @entity15 measure paid off			1
in 2009 , a similar referendum in @entity15 failed when voters rejected the governor 's decision to allow same - sex marriage			1
tuesday 's results represent a remarkable turnaround			2
" the secret to our success is that we won over hearts and minds , " @entity195 said			0
" @entity4 are fair and want to see their gay and lesbian friends , co-workers and family members have the freedom to marry			0
" thirty - eight states have passed bans on marriages between people of the same gender , mostly by amending their constitutions to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman			2
in the six states -- @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268 -- and the @entity269 where gays and lesbians have previously won marriage rights , it was because of actions taken by judges or legislators , not voters			1
on election night , @entity127 joined friends as they all watched results on tv			0
she was n't expecting @entity15 's ballot to pass			1
but then they heard the news			0
" i said : ' hey , did that just happen ? ' " she did a double take			0
@entity0 's @entity288 contributed to this report .			2

voters in @entity15 and @entity14 approve same - sex marriage
it 's the first time voters have approved same - sex marriage
in the past , only judges or legislatures had approved it
the votes show a dramatic shift in attitudes over the decades
