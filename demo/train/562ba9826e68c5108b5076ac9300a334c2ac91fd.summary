@entity1 prime minister @entity0 warned @entity3 delegates monday not to overlook the threats posed by @entity5 and @entity6 in their zeal to defeat the terror group @entity8			1
" ladies and gentlemen , would you let isis enrich uranium ? would you let @entity8 build a heavy - water reactor ? would you let @entity8 develop intercontinental ballistic missiles			1
of course , you would n't , " @entity0 said			2
" then you must n't let the @entity16 state of @entity5 do those things either , because here 's what will happen , " he said			1
" once @entity5 produces atomic bombs , all the charms and all the smiles will suddenly disappear			2
and it 's then that the ayatollahs will show their true face and unleash their aggressive fanaticism on the entire world			0
" @entity0 praised the growing effort to defeat @entity8 , the militant group that has seized large swaths of @entity31 and @entity32 , but simultaneously chastised many of the countries joining that coalition for failing , he said , to recognize that @entity8 and @entity6 " are branches of the same poisonous tree			1
" " for the @entity39 , all politics is global , " he said			0
" because their ultimate goal is to dominate the world			0
now that threat might seem exaggerated to some , since it starts out small , like a cancer that attacks a particular part of the body			0
but left unchecked , the cancer grows , metastasizing over wider and wider areas			0
" to protect the peace and the security of the world , we must remove this cancer before it 's too late , " he said			0
he also compared militant islamists to the @entity57 who led @entity58 in @entity59 , saying extremists today seek world domination , as did @entity63 's minions			1
" the @entity57 believed in a master race			2
the militant islamists believe in a master faith , " he said			1
" they just disagree who among them will be the master of the master faith			0
that 's what they truly disagree about			0
" @entity0 's speech was a " blatant manipulation of the facts , " @entity72 , a member of the executive committee of the @entity74 , said in statement issued shortly after the speech			1
" blaming the victim has always been the failed policy of the politically and morally bankrupt , and @entity0 is no exception , " @entity72 said .			2
