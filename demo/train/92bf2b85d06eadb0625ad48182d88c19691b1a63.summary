as football 's top event kicks off in @entity3 , @entity0 dispels some of the myths surrounding the @entity6 's host country -- and its approach to the game it is showcasing			1
myth : many @entity3 are in the mood to party reality : many thought that the awarding of the finals -- and the @entity15 in @entity16 -- would be a " coming out " party for @entity3 , confirming its new status as a global player			1
but that is not the atmosphere which seems to be taking hold			1
for the last year there have been protests over the spiraling costs of the tournament ( around $ 11.5 billion ) and government priorities			2
many @entity3 have demanded " @entity33 standard " hospitals , schools , and public transportation , not just stadiums			1
in 1950 , the last time @entity3 hosted a @entity6 , @entity3 seemed to conform more readily to the stereotype of festive , soccer - mad nationalists ( still to be found in some international media )			1
@entity3 in 1950 was a largely agrarian country , aspiring to national development and global influence but without the wealth and stature it has today			1
back then , most @entity3 ' anxieties seem to have been about football			1
the country was ready to crown its national team , the @entity46 , as world champions			0
@entity3 's loss to @entity49 in the final in the newly built @entity51 ( then the largest in the world ) was seen as a disaster by many , and a confirmation of what the playwright and football commentator @entity56 described as @entity3 ' " mongrel complex " ( complexo de vira - lata ) or sense of inferiority			1
now you 've got an 85 % urban country with high rates of literacy , growing wealth and universal primary school enrollment			2
so this is a country that 's really been transformed over the last six decades			0
young people , in particular , seem untroubled by an inferiority complex and are globally aware			0
they are not afraid to take to the streets to complain			0
myth : @entity3 are naturally good at football reality : many people are taken aback by the fact that @entity3 has the unique claim of having won the @entity6 five times , and participated in all the finals			1
you could offer an essentialist explanation : " well , it 's because of the mixture of races , because @entity3 like music , the culture of street football and because they 're so passionate			1
it means they 're just naturally so tricky and skilful			0
" the more plausible explanation is that the state invested heavily in football as a means of gaining prestige and asserting identity			2
so it 's a state project which has borne fruit			0
the epitome of the state 's exploitation of @entity3 football expertise was the repressive dictatorship 's propaganda attempts to associate itself with the success of the @entity3 team in the 1970 @entity6 finals			1
i think when some people protest now , they are maybe ( unconsciously ) associating this @entity6 with that authoritarian project -- and rejecting it			0
myth : the stadiums will be packed across the country reality : there are 12 cities taking part			2
one of these , @entity116 state capital @entity115 is about 4,500 miles from @entity16			0
@entity33 itself did not require that so many cities be involved but the @entity3 government was conscious it should not be held in a few selected cities			1
instead it should be shared regionally			0
that 's characteristic of @entity3 political style			1
but it has meant huge stadia have been constructed in some places that probably will not fill them often , including @entity127 , @entity128			0
these stadia could look like crumbling white elephants in a few years , leaving a negative legacy in some cities and a growing indignation			0
myth : a @entity6 win equates to ballot box success reality : the presidential election between the incumbent president @entity136 of the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) and her two main opponents , @entity139 of the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) and @entity141 of the @entity142 ( @entity143 ) will kick into full gear after the final on july 13			0
president @entity136 would like a successful , well - organized @entity6 to bolster her re-election chances , although she probably does not need the @entity3 team to do well in order to win			2
candidates @entity150 and @entity141 could benefit from a perception that the @entity6 did not go well , but they probably will not be able to make too much of this in the campaign , as they both helped to organize it in their home states			0
myth : @entity3 has fallen out of love with football reality : in 2014 , @entity3 's passion for football is still evident			1
@entity3 have purchased the majority of the 2.5 million tickets despite high prices			2
some local protests will likely happen but probably not on the scale of last year			0
people are wary of being seen as disloyally " @entity167 " and the government is alert to respond to any disruption			0
with international attention , there is too much at stake			0
in 1968 , @entity174 's @entity173 visited @entity3 where she watched a match at the @entity51 stadium and met @entity177			2
then - @entity174 ambassador @entity178 noted its importance as " football is the soul of @entity3			1
" but is it ? perhaps , but that soul shares football with other passions , including desire for more democracy and less corruption			2
it could be said that protests have added to pressure on @entity33 leading to the current questioning of the @entity190 bid for the @entity191 , and investigation			0
in this sense @entity3 are playing an important role in world football , not simply in their traditional role as brilliant players and passionate fans , but as protesters against and reformers of what many allege is a corrupt institution of global governance .			1

many thought awarding of finals would be a " coming out " party for @entity3 , writes @entity0
but that is not the atmosphere which seems to be taking hold , he writes
@entity3 in 1950 was without the wealth and stature it has today
@entity3 are playing an important role in football as protesters and reformers
