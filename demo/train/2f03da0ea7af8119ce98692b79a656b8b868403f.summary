all seven pleaded not guilty tuesday to the various charges in a federal court in @entity60			0
afterward , four of the men -- @entity36 , @entity38 , @entity42 and @entity44 -- were held without bail , though bail could become an option later			0

meanwhile , @entity39 , @entity69 and @entity41 all were free on bail			0

@entity41 's bond was $ 1.4 million bond , and bond was $ 1 million for the other two			0
investigators speaking at the news conference in @entity28 said the money found in the raids amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars			0
the operations in @entity8 were carried out in the southern region of @entity85 , home of the ' @entity22 syndicate , and in the cities of @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			1
the @entity8 mafia family involved in the alliance , or " bridge , " with the @entity95 , is called @entity97			2
tuesday 's operation was the first ever jointly run by @entity72 and @entity8 police targeting the ties between the two countries ' ' @entity22 mafia families , investigators said			1
anti-mafia prosecutors in @entity85 have been carrying out an investigation over the past two years , and @entity8 police compiled a 2,000 - page report detailing what was learned , including information from phone wiretaps			2
@entity72 attorney : ' lasting blow ' the @entity8 national anti-mafia body , which coordinated the investigation and operation , alleges that the ' @entity22 is behind a ring of drug trafficking between @entity118 and @entity119 , @entity120 , the @entity72 and @entity8			1
@entity72 attorney @entity121 said the operation had " dealt a lasting blow " to the ' @entity22 's efforts to gain a foothold in @entity6			1
" @entity22 is an exceptionally dangerous , sophisticated and insidious criminal organization , with tentacles stretching from @entity8 to countries around the world , " she said			2
" the defendant @entity38 sought to use his connections with both ' @entity22 and the @entity3 crime family to extend his own criminal reach literally around the globe			0
" together , the accused sought to move cocaine and heroin into the @entity72 under the guise of legitimate shipping operations , with the help of a corrupt official at the port of @entity143 , in @entity85 , the @entity33 said			2
@entity38 , from @entity60 , has lived in @entity85 and used his connections with both the @entity3 organized crime family and the ' @entity22 to pursue international criminal activity , it said			2
among those arrested in @entity8 are his father - in - law , @entity149 , and his cousin , @entity151 , it said			2
during two joint @entity11 - @entity8 operations in @entity8 , @entity38 and @entity153 sold more than 1.3 kilograms of heroin to an @entity11 undercover agent for what they believed was eventual distribution in the @entity72 , the @entity33 said			1
in @entity6 , @entity38 , @entity42 and @entity44 sold the undercover agent more than a kilogram of heroin , it added			0
cocaine found in canned fruit shipment @entity38 , 44 , is also accused of plotting to smuggle 500 kilograms of cocaine , concealed in frozen food , in shipping containers from @entity165 , in @entity166 , to @entity85 , thanks to connections with @entity170 drug cartels operating in @entity165			0
@entity8 court documents show the conspiracy slowed after shipping containers from a @entity165 shipping company were seized in @entity174 and found to contain more than $ 7 million in cocaine hidden in cans labeled as containing coconut milk and pineapple , the @entity33 said			0
investigators said at the news conference that the @entity170 - @entity85 connection was established in @entity6			2
law enforcement officials are still trying to establish how the drug traveled from @entity170 to @entity165 but said that some of the suspects took trips to @entity187 following their @entity6 meetings			1
the illegal traffic of drugs between the @entity72 and @entity8 stopped by police could have earned the mafia millions of euros , authorities said , though they declined to give an exact figure			1
@entity196 , head of the @entity197 of the @entity198 , told reporters that the operation demonstrated that the " ' @entity22 is one of the strongest organizations in the world in illegal drug trade			0
" he cited its sophisticated network of contacts and its ability to adapt and find new markets , including " expanding beyond @entity8 borders			0
" historic links @entity196 said that historically , the @entity95 had had ties with the @entity212 , @entity212			0
but their involvement in the illegal traffic of heroin , known as the " @entity217 , " was dismantled or severely curtailed in the 1980s , he said , and they are now trading mainly cocaine			0
the latest operation , according to @entity196 and @entity11 officials , shows that the mafia families of the " new continent " are still seeking and relying on " old country " connections -- which is why investigators dubbed the operation " @entity15			1
" according to @entity196 , the @entity8 - @entity72 mafia families " need this new bridge to connect and support the traffic of cocaine			1
" while the existence of a connection between the @entity85 mafia and @entity72 mafia families has been well known , tuesday 's operation shows its great strength and reach , investigators said			1
one of the more alarming discoveries to emerge from the operation was evidence that ' @entity22 has also reached out to the @entity242 in the heroin trade , another investigator said .			0

no bail for 4 @entity72 suspects ; bond was set for 3 others , and all were released
@entity72 *justice* officials accuse these 7 arrested in @entity6 of drug trafficking
the raids zero in on the @entity85 mafia , the ' @entity22 ; 17 arrested in @entity8
it is the first such joint *crackdown* on ties between mafia families in the @entity72 and @entity8
