-- when the apocalypse comes , i 'm pretty sure i can get by for a while on @entity4 and @entity5			2
pants wo n't be necessary			0
but if we 're talking about real long - term survival , no matter what horrible hell eventually strikes down upon us -- be it zombies or fire from the skies -- i 'm pretty much a sitting duck			1
my little craftsman - style bungalow is n't exactly a fortress			1
conversely , this week the @entity16 started buzzing about what appears to be the ultimate doomsday bunker that recently went up for sale in @entity20 for $ 1.75 million			1
of course , the bunker comes along with a proper above - ground house			1
but the real draw is the amazing subterranean hideaway that 's 26 feet below			1
a wealthy entrepreneur names @entity26 built the compound back in 1978 -- right during the middle of the @entity29			1
fearing that the @entity30 might drop some sort of @entity33 - flattening nuke ( or maybe just a really aggressive bear on a unicycle ) @entity26 created his grand survival plan with all the must - have comforts of home			1
there does n't appear to be a giant ball - pit filled with hamsters			2
that said , it pretty much has everything else you 'd want if you were to live beneath the dirt			0
and it 's not just a tiny space to move and breathe -- we 're talking 15,000 square feet of basement with a pool , two @entity51 , a sauna , and a four - hole putting green			1
it 's all decorated to feel like you 're in a real house or in a real backyard			2
hell , it even has a dance floor			0
" everyone we know is dead			0
let 's @entity65 ! " the actual living space within the basement is a complete two - bedroom house with exterior walls and a front a door			1
it kind of looks like it came from @entity74 , and measures 5,000 square feet			2
which is huge ! and not just for a doomsday bunker			1
for the sake of comparison , my entire home in @entity79 is only 1,500 square feet			2
and it 's not nearly as pimped out as @entity26 's bunker			1
what can i say ? the paper vase filled with multi-colored sticks from @entity87 seemed wild and exciting at the time			0
meanwhile , at the ' 70s - retro bunker in @entity20 , one can relax around the fake property amidst murals of nature , just as if you were actually outside			1
and to enhance the mood , you can adjust the lights and ceiling stars to simulate different times of day			0
the switches are labeled for sunset , day , dusk and night			0
the most advanced switch in my house turns on the garbage disposal			0
over the years , the home - and - bunker combo at 3970 @entity105 has gone through different owners since @entity26 first built it			1
the most recent occupant bought the property back in 2005 for $ 2 million			1
however , last summer @entity110 foreclosed on the home , and now they 're trying to sell it off -- presumably to someone who seeks safety at the @entity115 , but does n't mind living in what , otherwise , seems like a rather drab part of town			0
also known as metro @entity20			1
mind you , there 's nothing overly horrible about the location -- it 's conveniently close to downtown if you need it -- but a little stroll around the block using @entity128 street view reveals that the neighborhood is kind of boring , and the house actually faces an ugly office building and a bunch of power lines			2
on the plus side , i did locate a @entity136 less than a mile away			0
and , in a pinch , those delicious spinning meat tubes at the counter should be able to withstand the apocalypse for at least a decade or two			0
" son , distract the zombies			0
i 'm sending your mother out for more taquitos			0
" though i 'm sure he did n't consider proximity to convenience stores , @entity26 was , nevertheless , a big believer in underground living in general			2
before his @entity20 compound , he lived in a similar - style home in the ' 60s near @entity152 , @entity153			1
eventually , he even co-founded @entity154 to build these subterranean dwellings for others , and he presented the idea at the 1964 @entity158 in @entity159 with the slogan : how would you like sunshine every day ... when you want it ? of course , we all do			0
that 's why we have prozac and whiskey			2
but if you fear the end of days and want to enjoy your final hours in a weird underground time capsule from the ' 70s , all this can be yours			2
or you can just hunker down with me			0
you 'll love my garbage disposal			0
follow @entity174 on @entity175 .			0

the 70 's - style @entity20 doomsday bunker was built during the *height* of the @entity29
twenty - six feet underground , the bunker feels like you are actually outside
the bunker is now being sold as a foreclosure for $ 1.75 million
