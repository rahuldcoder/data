-- the man charged wednesday with attempting to blow up the @entity2 , the latest alleged jihadist to be charged in a law enforcement sting , may or may not have had the capability to create a major terrorist incident			1
but if his case follows the pattern of other similar sting operations , what is clear is that he faces very long odds in court			1
@entity13 , a 21 - year - old @entity14 from @entity15 , is accused of plotting to detonate a 1,000 - pound bomb outside the @entity2 building in @entity18			1
but as acting assistant fbi director @entity19 explained , " it is important to emphasize that the public was never at risk ... because two of the defendant 's ' accomplices ' were actually an @entity27 source and an @entity27 undercover agent			0
" according to the complaint against him , @entity13 did travel to the @entity30 by his own account to wage " jihad			0
" but @entity13 does n't seem like the sharpest aspiring terrorist			2
according to the complaint , @entity13 believed that the undercover agent he was talking to had traveled overseas to meet @entity36 's leadership to get approval for the @entity39 plot during the summer of this year			0
not too many folks are known to have traveled to @entity42 's tribal regions from the @entity30 to meet with @entity36 's leaders in recent years			0
@entity44 plotting : @entity45 or sincerity ? yet @entity13 will be quite unlikely to successfully mount a defense that he was entrapped by the feds			2
since september 11 , 2001 , 207 individuals have been indicted on charges related to jihadist terrorism			1
of those , 94 had interacted with an informant or an undercover law enforcement officer in the leadup to their arrest , according to data compiled by the @entity59			1
defense attorneys and members of the local community have in many of those cases accused authorities of entrapment , though that claim is rarely used as an official defense , since entrapment is extremely difficult to prove			2
in one such contentious case in 2004 , two imams at a mosque in @entity72 , @entity39 , @entity73 and @entity74 , became embroiled in an elaborate terrorism plot created entirely by the @entity27 after @entity74 approached a longtime @entity27 informant to ask about obtaining an illegal driver 's license for his brother			2
then , after agreeing to launder money that the @entity27 informant said would be used to buy a surface - to - air missile for terrorists , the two men were tried and convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison on money laundering and terrorism charges			0
@entity73 -- who spoke broken @entity88 -- maintained throughout the trial that he had n't even known he was laundering money , much less that he was supporting terrorism , and dozens of community members -- muslim and @entity94 -- wrote letters to the courts and to local newspapers describing @entity73 as a devoted father and peace - loving , law - abiding member of society			2
however , the odds are stacked against suspects like @entity73			0
of the 81 jihadist terrorism suspects who have gone to trial since 9/11 in cases involving an undercover agent or informant , every single one has either been convicted or pleaded guilty			1
entrapment defenses just have n't worked in post- 9/11 jihadist terrorism cases			1
by contrast , of the 45 non-jihadist terrorism suspects -- who include neo-nazis , anarchists and anti-government extremists -- who have gone on trial since 9/11 in plots involving undercover agents or informants , the rate of successfully obtaining convictions or guilty pleas was about 77 % rather than the 100 % conviction rate in jihadist terrorism cases			1
@entity127 @entity126 said wednesday , " whether @entity36 operatives like @entity130 or those inspired by them like @entity132 , terrorists have tried time and again to make @entity39 their killing @entity135 we 're up to 15 plots and counting since 9/11 , with the @entity2 now added to a list of iconic targets that previously included the @entity140 , the @entity141 and @entity142			2
" but few of these 15 plots were truly threatening to @entity39			0
one of the terrorist suspects @entity126 mentioned , @entity132 , allegedly came close last year to completing the construction of three pipe bombs he planned to use against @entity39 police officers and returning @entity30 troops , before authorities arrested him			0
but the @entity27 had turned down more than one request from the @entity152 to get involved with the investigation because its agents were of the opinion that @entity132 " did n't have the predisposition or the ability to do anything on his own , " according to one anonymous law enforcement official			1
in fact , multiple acquaintances of @entity132 's told police he was mentally unstable and had once tried to circumcise himself			0
he had difficulty drilling the holes in the pipe bomb parts that the undercover informant had provided him with and asked an upstairs neighbor to help him			0
this does n't sound like a cunning terrorist plotting to wreak havoc on the @entity30 public			0
similarly , the other terrorist mentioned by @entity126 , @entity42 - @entity30 @entity130 , was certainly someone who had met with @entity36 leaders in @entity42 , but the harebrained plan he hatched to bring down the @entity140 was to use a blowtorch to burn through the massive steel cables of the bridge , which had no chance of succeeding and which he never attempted			0
the good news is that even these not especially threatening cases , like that of @entity185 , are becoming increasingly unusual			0
since 2009 , jihadist terrorism cases in the @entity30 has been on a steady decline , with only three suspected jihadists indicted in 2012 , compared with 25 in 2011 and a record 44 in 2009			1
why these jihadists ' terrorism cases have so precipitously declined in number is hard to diagnose precisely			1
but law enforcement efforts , which are well - publicized as in the @entity13 case , have surely had a significant deterrent effect , and the ideology of @entity36 has continued to lose whatever appeal it once enjoyed among a tiny minority of @entity199 living in the @entity30 .			1

@entity205 : jihadists arrested as a result of many law enforcement sting operations
he says they have n't succeeded in getting *acquittals* by using the entrapment defense
