-- does a special woman in your life spend far too much time thinking for herself ? you know			0
using her brain for original thought ? if so , there 's a new consumer electronics product out there that 's just perfect for her			1
it 's the @entity13 -- an 8 - inch tablet device designed specifically for women , and already preloaded with special female - friendly apps			1
as opposed to , say , @entity17 which , apparently , requires machismo			0
yes , it seems the @entity21 - based @entity20 figured if there 's one thing a woman needs , it 's a handheld computer specifically engineered to insult her intelligence			1
i sort of picture the dudes on their r&d team having several glances through an old copy of @entity31 at the dentist 's office and immediately declaring a full understanding of the female brain			1
" our data suggest they enjoy yoga			0
" and then they made the @entity13			1
it 's pink ! perhaps they thought about making one for men , as well			1
but that was always going to be difficult			0
our male minds are just too amazingly complex and superior , for it takes a true stroke of brilliance to successfully belch the entire alphabet			0
and that 's something we 're good at			1
anyway , i guess men and women are just completely different			1
and maybe that 's why they think the @entity13 makes a perfect gift for your mom			1
or , really , any nice lady you 'd like to openly disrespect			0
what 's that you say ? anniversary coming up ? no problem			1
" and that 's a big selling point for the manufacturer , who proudly boasts that , unlike all the other touchscreen devices on the market , this thing is the only one designed " exclusively for women			1
" that 's why they preloaded it with those gender - specific apps -- so a poor , hopeless young lady does n't have to think about which ones she actually , you know ... wants			1
because a female would never understand how to search for apps on her own			0
plus , it would just divert time away from being a baby factory and personal chef to the real genius in the house			0
the one who 's in the basement , not wearing pants , working on a statistical analysis for his fantasy baseball draft			2
of course , these @entity93 preselected apps will do almost everything a woman needs in life , from helping her create a shopping list to tracking weight loss to whatever it is the perfume app does			0
" do i smell pretty , now ? " " not really			0
try rubbing it against your head			0
" at this very moment , everyone at the @entity20 office in @entity21 is likely overjoyed by the @entity93 's sudden emergence on the @entity109			1
though they hope to " explore all markets , " right now the device is only sold in the @entity113 and parts of @entity115			2
still , it 's trending worldwide			1
because it 's completely insane			2
it actually first came out in october as a gift idea -- presumably for the guy who does n't mind sleeping on the couch			2
now , for some strange reason , it 's making an internet comeback			2
maybe it 's the price point			2
the @entity13 only costs $ 200			1
and it runs on the @entity127 operating system			0
so , look out @entity128			0
there 's a new sexy sheriff in town			2
it 's pink ! but what about power and memory ? with a @entity138 processor and @entity139 of memory storage , the manufacturers made the @entity13 perfectly equipped for even the longest grocery lists			1
guys , your lady could literally spend all day at the market buying food before coming home to cook			0
for you ! look , you 've worked hard tweeting critical thoughts on your favorite football team			0
so , just relax while she enjoys a little @entity151 in the produce aisle			0
plus , what if you decided to have a man - party with your man - friends , and you were planning to watch man - sports and maybe play man - games like " tickle time " and risk ? clearly , you 're going to need a lot of man - supplies			2
with the @entity13 in your house , you can simply shout upstairs to your woman and demand she start a list			1
she wo n't forget a single item for her king			0
and while she does all the shopping -- her very favorite hobby -- you can do far more important things like pass gas and watch fistfights on @entity175			0
holla ! yes , @entity20 literally thought of everything when it comes to the @entity13			1
sure , they made a few assumptions about what women want , but where they skipped out on any actual science and dignity , they 've passed the savings on to you			2
and you know what else ? it 's pink !			0

" @entity194 " is @entity192 's weekly , *offbeat* look at what 's trending
