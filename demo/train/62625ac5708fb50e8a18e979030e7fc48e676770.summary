@entity0 -- a " smoking gun " e-mail allegedly connecting a concert promoter to @entity5 's death was revealed this week as a judge unsealed documents in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by @entity5 's mother and children			1
the trial next month in @entity0 could shed new light on the pop icon 's last days as dr. @entity15 , who did not testify at his own involuntary manslaughter trial , and @entity5 's oldest son @entity17 , 16 , are on the witness list			1
@entity5 died two weeks before his " @entity21 " comeback concerts , organized by @entity20 , were to have debuted in @entity22 in the summer of 2009			2
e-mails suggested that the promoter was worried about @entity5 's missed rehearsals and they sought @entity15 's help in getting him ready			1
@entity17 , @entity27 and @entity28 and their grandmother , @entity29 , contend that @entity20 's pressure on @entity15 to have @entity5 ready for daily rehearsals despite his fragile health led to his death from an overdose of surgical anesthetic			1
the judge ruled wednesday that @entity5 lawyers have shown enough evidence that @entity20 hired and supervised @entity15 to warrant a jury trial			2
she also ruled there was evidence to support the @entity43 ' claim that @entity20 executives could have foreseen that @entity15 would use dangerous drugs in treating the pop icon			0
" now that the court has ruled that there is evidence that it was foreseeable that @entity20 's actions resulted in @entity5 's death , the jackson family feels vindicated from the public smear campaign that @entity20 has waged against them , " @entity5 lawyer @entity47 said sunday			1
" the truth about what happened to @entity5 , which @entity20 has tried to keep hidden from the public since the day @entity5 died , is finally emerging			0
we look forward to the trial where the rest of the story will come to light			0
" a cornerstone of the @entity43 ' case is an e-mail @entity20 co-ceo @entity67 wrote 11 days before @entity5 's june 25 , 2009 , death			1
the e-mail to show director @entity70 addressed concerns that @entity15 had kept @entity5 from a rehearsal the day before : " we want to remind ( @entity15 ) that it is @entity20 , not @entity5 , who is paying his salary			2
we want to remind him what is expected of him			0
" @entity5 lawyers , calling it a " smoking gun , " argue the e-mail is evidence that @entity20 used @entity15 's fear of losing his $ 150,000 - a - month job as @entity5 's personal physician to pressure him to have @entity5 ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health			1
@entity70 , who had worked closely with @entity5 on previous tours , sounded a loud warning about his health after @entity5 showed up for a rehearsal shivering just over a week before his death			0
he wrote in an e-mail to @entity20 president @entity20 : " it is like there are two people there			0
one ( deep inside ) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not wanting us to quit him , the other in this weakened and troubled state			0
i believe we need professional guidance in this matter			0
" @entity20 responded with a glowing endorsement of @entity15 : " this doctor is extremely successful ( we check everyone out ) and does not need this gig so he is totally unbiased and ethical			0
" @entity5 lawyers point to another e-mail exchange as evidence that @entity20 was directly involved with pressuring @entity15 to have @entity5 at rehearsals			1
the e-mail was sent by @entity20 tour accountant @entity112 to an insurance broker two days before @entity5 died : " @entity20 and dr. @entity15 are responsible for @entity5 rehearsal and attendance schedule			1
" @entity15 told investigators two days after @entity5 's death that he used the surgical anesthetic propofol every night for two months to help him rest for rehearsals			2
it was a procedure @entity5 demanded , he said			0
the @entity123 coroner ruled that @entity5 had died from an overdose of propofol in combination with sedatives			0
@entity15 is serving a prison sentence for his involuntary manslaughter conviction			2
@entity20 argues it has no liability in @entity5 's death because @entity15 was not its employee			1
@entity20 lawyer @entity132 did not respond sunday to @entity1 calls for comment , but he did give a short statement last year : " @entity135 did not hire dr. @entity15 nor were they responsible for the death of @entity5			1
" the lawsuit seeks a judgment against @entity20 equal to the money @entity5 would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime if he had not died in 2009			2
if @entity20 is found liable , it could cost the company several billion dollars , according to estimates of @entity5 's income potential			2
@entity20 is a subsidiary of @entity20 , a global entertainment company that is now for sale with an $ 8 billion asking price			0
@entity153 judge @entity152 , in her ruling rejecting @entity20 's request to have the case thrown out , said she agreed that the @entity5 lawyers provided evidence that @entity20 did n't do " a sufficient background check of dr. @entity15 , which would have established that @entity15 was deeply in debt			1
" @entity5 's previous relationship with @entity15 , who treated him and his children for minor illnesses in @entity161 , did not relieve @entity20 of liability , " although the fact may be relevant in determining proportional liability and damages , " she said			1
while the @entity20 lawyers argued the company could not have foreseen that @entity15 might use dangerous drugs on @entity5 in preparation for the tour , @entity152 said there was evidence that @entity67 had " previous tour experiences " with @entity5 in which " tour doctors " gave " large amounts of drugs / controlled substances to him			2
" @entity67 testified in @entity15 's trial that he worked as tour manager for @entity5 's " @entity181 " and " history " tours before joining @entity20			1
the judge cited " @entity67 's general knowledge of the ethical issues surrounding ' tour doctors ' and the practice of administering drugs to performing artists			0
" " there is a triable issue of fact as to whether it was foreseeable that such a physician under strong financial pressure may compromise his @entity196 and do what was known by @entity20 's executives to be an unfortunate practice in the entertainment industry for financial gain , " the judge wrote			0
