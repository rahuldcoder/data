@entity0 -- like many companies in @entity4 , @entity2 uses celebrities to attract clients			1
except , in this case , they 're dead			1
that 's because they 're in the funeral business			1
" we have 700 celebrities here -- military martyrs , politicians , opera stars , and actors , " explains @entity11 , the manager of the company 's flagship cemetery -- an immaculately manicured parkland setting on the outskirts of @entity0 -- as he shows me around in a stretch golf cart			1
he says this star - power is attracting ordinary clients and their families looking for an extra special resting place for their loved ones			2
hot offering after 20 years in the business , @entity2 , which operates six cemeteries across @entity4 , went public in @entity34 in december			1
it was one of the hottest offerings of the quarter , with respected institutional @entity39 investors like @entity40 buying in early			1
why the hype ? put plainly , @entity4 is n't getting any younger			1
that 's bad news for most of the world 's economy			2
the lasting effects of the one child policy and natural demographic trends as @entity4 gets richer have shaved as much as 3 % off of @entity4 's growth rates , according to a recent study by @entity52 economists			1
but with more than 180 million people over the age of 60 , @entity2 gains were others ' losses			1
" we ca n't refer to it as a death boom , " says managing director @entity58			2
" the fact is , at the end of this trend , elderly people will die			1
but when they leave the world , they have a wish to be remembered , and that leaves us to provide them a good service			2
" bespoke service to deliver that service , @entity2 appears to be employing a classic strategy of vertical integration			2
if you ca n't make it over to pay your respects , no problem			2
a grave attendant will put flowers out for you -- for a fee			2
you need a statue of grandpa ? they have in - house sculptors kneading away at clay busts for casting			0
" one client wanted changes made for three years until it was perfect , " @entity58 says			0
there is even a restaurant on site if you want a banquet while paying your respects -- specializing in @entity0 's famed lion 's head meatballs			0
" when you buy a plot , it is just the first step , " says @entity11 , walking among the perfectly manicured lawns and polished headstones			0
" people even come here to get wedding pictures taken			1
" taboo @entity4 couples cavorting around a cemetery in their wedding duds was unthinkable a few years ago , but times are changing			1
while death is still taboo among older generations , @entity58 says it 's becoming less of an issue as @entity4 opens up and more people migrate to urban areas			1
so they focus on clients from top - tier cities			0
" the cities are transforming and during the process of urbanization , there is a great demand for a quality burial service to serve the needs of city dwellers , " he explains			0
but to target city clients , @entity2 faces severe cost challenges			0
land costs near @entity0 alone have risen to such eye - watering levels that even a tiny patch of land for a grave can cost tens of thousands of dollars			0
the space issue has also gotten so bad that the @entity0 government has increased subsidy rates to try persuade people to bury relatives at sea			1
so , from traditional south - facing tombs in neat rows , @entity2 now puts grave - stones in semi-circles to maximize space			0
there is also a multistorey mausoleum in the grounds housing a variety of themed rooms where families can place their urn alongside items such as chocolate , photos and even cell phones -- items their relatives may need in the afterlife			0
these rooms are accessed via a hotel - style key card			0
we drive up to a grassy hill with a white statue of iconic pop star @entity161			0
the late singer 's most famous songs play in a loop from the memorial			0
it 's one of their major draws			0
" they secured clothing from her family and shipped it from @entity174 to bury here , " a worker tells us			0
" to change people 's traditions is very , very difficult , " says @entity11			1
" but it 's not impossible			0
