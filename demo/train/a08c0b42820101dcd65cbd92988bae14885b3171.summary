@entity0 -- they tried in @entity3 , at the ballot box and in the @entity5 , but republicans have been unable to stop @entity7			0
now they have a new angle : suing president @entity9 over changes in enforcing his signature health care reforms			1
house speaker @entity12 framed the issue as a matter of presidential overreach when he announced the focus of the lawsuit on thursday			0
" in 2013 , the president changed the health care law without a vote of @entity3 , effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it , " @entity12 said in a statement			1
" that 's not the way our system of government was designed to work			0
no president should have the power to make laws on his or her own , " he said			0
@entity9 and @entity36 called that premise malarkey			2
" you 're going to sue me for doing my job ? ok , " the president told an applauding crowd thursday in @entity42 , @entity43 , using the opportunity to take a jab at congressional dysfunction he blames on @entity48 obstruction			1
" think about that , " @entity9 said			2
" you 're going to use taxpayer money to sue me for doing my job while you do n't do your job			0
" the issue blends constitutional debate on the balance of government powers with the partisan fervor of election - year politics			1
here are some questions that help provide a deeper look : 1 ) what 's this all about , anyway ? @entity9 and @entity36 passed the @entity7 in 2010 with no @entity48 votes			1
ever since , the political right has tried to derail the law nicknamed @entity7 , with affection by the president and derision by his foes			0
conservatives despise the measure that requires @entity71 obtain health insurance as part of reforms intended to lower the overall cost of @entity71 health care , calling it an unworkable government expansion			1
lawsuits challenging it as unconstitutional wound their way through the appeals process to the @entity5 , which ruled it legal in 2012			0
republicans led by presidential nominee @entity83 ran against it that year , making repeal of @entity7 a major campaign promise			0
voters re-elected @entity9 and kept democrats in control of the @entity90 , while @entity48 maintained their @entity92 majority			1
@entity92 @entity48 have voted more than 40 times to repeal or dismantle the law , but their efforts never advanced in the @entity90			1
now @entity12 and his @entity48 colleagues are focusing on @entity9 's 2013 decision to delay a provision in the health care law that requires employers with more than 50 workers provide them with health insurance			1
the so - called employer mandate originally was to take effect on january 1 , but the administration 's move put it off for a year to allow more time for the transition			2
another revision in february further extended the mandate 's phase - in			0
2 ) thanks , but what 's it really about ? election - year politics , mostly			1
@entity48 contend @entity9 has routinely expanded his executive powers through presidential orders and other actions that usurp the authority of @entity3 granted by the @entity119			1
as examples , they cite a decision to stop deporting some young undocumented immigrants , as well as the employer mandate revision			0
until now , none of the grievances reached the level of a lawsuit by the @entity48 - controlled @entity92 against the president			1
thursday 's announcement of the @entity7 focus came less than four months before congressional elections that @entity48 hope will generate a huge conservative turnout to hold their @entity92 majority and seize control of the @entity90			1
@entity12 denied any political motive , telling reporters " it 's not about @entity48 versus @entity36			2
" " this is about the legislative branch that 's being disadvantaged by the executive branch , " he said , adding : " what we 're talking about here are places where the president is basically rewriting law to make it fit his own needs			0
" on friday , @entity92 spokesman @entity149 called the move " a taxpayer - funded political stunt " that he said failed to reflect the nation 's priorities			2
3 ) so did @entity9 overreach ? depends to whom you talk			2
@entity157 law professor @entity156 told the @entity158 in december that delaying the employer mandate provision of the health care law " crossed the constitutional line			1
" noting the original start date for the mandate was " a matter of considerable debate within @entity3 during deliberations , " @entity156 said " no express power " existed for the president to change it			0
not so , countered @entity170 , senior counsel of the at the progressive - minded @entity171			0
" these critics fault the @entity9 administration for making necessary adjustments in timing and matching enforcement priorities with resources and practical , humanitarian and other exigencies , " @entity170 told the same december hearing			2
" but exercising presidential judgment in carrying laws into execution is precisely what the @entity119 requires			0
" 4 ) typical lawyers			0
please make it simple for me			0
the question is whether @entity9 exercised more power than allowed in changing how the health care law works			1
@entity190 , a conservative @entity1 political commentator , noted the @entity5 recently voted 9 - 0 against @entity9 over recess appointments he made without congressional approval			2
" there are many people who agree that this president has gone too far in abusing his executive power , " @entity190 said friday			0
" that 's not about @entity36 and @entity48			2
that 's about our system of government			0
" @entity36 point out the lawsuit challenges a presidential action similar to steps taken by @entity9 's predecessors , such as @entity48 president @entity207 's waiving of penalties for impoverished senior citizens who missed the deadline for enrolling in @entity211 in 2006			1
" presidents get to deal with the implementation of these laws through the administrative process , " said @entity213 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity214			0
ironically , @entity92 @entity48 voted last year to delay the employer mandate just like @entity9 eventually did , but they are now planning to challenge @entity9 for it in court			1
@entity36 never took up the matter because it would have reopened debate on the health care law as the administration prepared to fully implement it			1
asked about such an apparent reversal , @entity48 say they were right back then and now , because @entity3 -- not the president -- is supposed to make such a change			2
5 ) so what happens next ? the @entity230 will hold a hearing next week on the proposal to sue @entity9 , with the @entity48 - led panel expected to approve it			1
however , legal experts say challenges remain to getting the case before a judge			1
for example , @entity238 must establish legal standing to file such a lawsuit , which means proving that @entity9 's action harmed the legislature as an institution			2
meanwhile , the partisan carping and finger - pointing will continue in @entity0			0
@entity1 's @entity247 and @entity248 contributed to this report .			0

@entity92 @entity48 say they *'ll* sue president @entity9 over his health care reforms
is it a constitutional challenge or election - year politics ?
legal experts argue over who is right
challenges exist to getting a lawsuit before a judge
