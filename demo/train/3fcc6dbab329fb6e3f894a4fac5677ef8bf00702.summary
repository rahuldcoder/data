@entity0 -- president @entity4 indicated a willingness wednesday to agree to a short - term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit , if @entity8 will accept it , a @entity3 lawmaker told @entity1			1
the president signaled more " give " to the idea of a six - week deal to hike the debt ceiling during a private @entity13 meeting with @entity14 , said the lawmaker , who spoke on condition of anonymity			1
the revelation comes amid a stalemate that has republicans trying to use spending and debt limit deadlines as leverage to wring concessions from @entity4 and @entity14			1
the result of the political standoff has been a partial government shutdown that is in its second week and fears of a possible @entity29 default on its debt that economists warn could cause another recession			1
@entity1 has been reporting that senior @entity13 @entity8 sources are signaling openness to the idea of a short - term increase in the debt ceiling , as long as @entity14 agree to negotiations on how to reduce the debt and deficit during the time the debt ceiling is increased			1
talking about a short - term solution , @entity4 told the group " if that 's what ( @entity46 ) @entity45 needs to climb out of the tree that he 's stuck in , then that 's something we should look at , " according to the lawmaker , who attended the meeting			1
' measure of hope ' the lawmaker left the @entity13 meeting with a " small measure of hope that this becomes an exit strategy			0
" the president warned if @entity8 want to propose a short - term fix and @entity14 say no , then the firm ground @entity14 think they 're standing on now would soften			1
@entity45 and @entity8 are demanding that @entity4 and @entity59 @entity14 negotiate on deficit reduction steps that would be part of legislation to reopen the government and raise the limit on federal borrowing needed to pay the bills			1
@entity4 has refused to enter formal talks until the shutdown ends and the debt ceiling has been raised to remove the threat of default			1
a senior @entity13 @entity8 told @entity1 that @entity8 members may be willing to go for a short - term debt ceiling hike -- lasting four to six weeks -- as long as the president agrees that negotiations will occur during that time			1
however , no specifics were immediately available about how such legislation would take shape or how the talks would occur			0
but @entity8 sources have also told @entity1 the parameters of those talks have to be specific enough to sell to their skeptical @entity8 members			2
so what would @entity14 be willing to talk about ? the lawmaker said @entity13 @entity14 are open to hearing what @entity8 have in mind with a short - term deal			1
@entity8 seeks leverage the shutdown began when @entity91 failed to pass a spending plan for the new fiscal year that started october 1			1
now another deadline looms -- the need to increase the federal borrowing limit by october 17 or risk a @entity29 default			1
days of back - and - forth rhetoric and jibes between the leaders have brought no direct negotiations , but plenty of accusations and political spin			0
on wednesday , @entity8 leaders appeared to shift their focus from efforts to dismantle @entity4 's signature health care reform , the initial driving force behind the shutdown , to securing spending cuts elsewhere			1
@entity45 , who earlier this year told his @entity8 colleagues that he was finished negotiating one on one with the president , has called for @entity4 to sit down for what he calls a " conversation " on how to reopen the government and prevent what would be the first - ever @entity29 default as soon as next week			1
but when @entity4 invited the entire @entity13 @entity8 caucus to the @entity13 as part of a series of meetings with legislators , @entity45 's office responded that only the @entity8 leadership and committee chairmen would attend the thursday gathering			2
" it is our hope that this will be a constructive meeting and that the president finally recognizes @entity29 expect their leaders to be able to sit down and resolve their differences , " said a statement by a @entity45 aide			0
@entity4 's invitation was intended to demonstrate outreach to republicans just eight days from when the @entity138 says @entity91 must increase the federal debt ceiling or risk default			1
@entity13 spokesman @entity141 said @entity4 was disappointed that @entity45 was limiting attendance at thursday 's meeting to fewer than 20 of the more than 200 @entity137			2
" the president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country " about the potential harmful impacts from the shutdown and a possible default , @entity141 said in a statement , repeating that @entity4 " will not pay the @entity8 ransom for doing their job			1
" meanwhile , @entity8 leaders were distancing themselves from demands by tea party conservatives to also make dismantling @entity159 a condition for agreement			2
@entity162 's plan drops @entity159 @entity8 rep. @entity162 of @entity163 , the @entity165 chairman who was the party 's vice presidential nominee last year , argued in a @entity167 op - ed that @entity14 and @entity8 should focus on " modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code			2
" " right now , we need to find common ground , " @entity162 wrote in the column posted online tuesday night			0
" we need to open the federal government			0
we need to pay our bills today -- and make sure we can pay our bills tomorrow			0
so let 's negotiate an agreement to make modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code			0
" however , @entity162 's column never mentioned @entity159 , focusing instead on forced spending cuts to domestic and military programs , as well as reforms to @entity186			0
@entity162 's @entity159 omission appeared to anger conservatives , who took to @entity189 in response			0
" much like @entity13 press , @entity162 does n't mention @entity159 in @entity167 oped , " tweeted @entity191 , spokesman for the conservative group @entity192			0
perhaps in response to a conservative backlash , @entity45 made a brief statement wednesday on the @entity13 floor that focused on the @entity8 message that @entity159 was detrimental to the country			0
he stopped short of linking it to any negotiations on ending the shutdown and raising the debt ceiling			1
@entity45 insists that the government must reduce deficits , declaring that @entity8 wo n't raise the debt ceiling without steps toward that goal			1
@entity45 demands cuts for debt limit increase but a @entity13 @entity8 leadership source told @entity1 on wednesday that @entity4 's rejection of linking negotiations to raising the borrowing limit meant @entity137 would likely be forced to agree to a " clean " debt ceiling limit proposal in exchange for setting up talks on deficit reduction steps			1
according to the source , the economic implications of a @entity29 default " scares people " to make such a deal acceptable to enough @entity137 in order to get negotiations started			2
the source acknowledged @entity45 may lack support from some or most of his @entity8 caucus , requiring @entity3 votes for the proposal to pass			2
@entity14 planning @entity3 sen. @entity232 of @entity233 told @entity1 his side already was mulling over " what we will discuss , what we will negotiate over , what things will be on the table			0
" @entity4 also met with the @entity239 at the @entity13			0
the @entity8 - led @entity13 passed a measure on tuesday to set up a special negotiating team comprising members of both parties from the @entity13 and @entity59 , but @entity4 and @entity14 rejected the concept as the latest @entity8 gimmick to force talks before raising the debt ceiling			1
meanwhile , @entity248 announced they will propose a measure to increase the debt ceiling beyond next year 's congressional elections with no additional issues attached			2
while many @entity8 are certain to oppose it , @entity3 leaders hope increased pressure for @entity91 to prevent a default next week will cause some @entity8 senators to vote for it			2
a @entity8 source told @entity1 on tuesday that the @entity13 was having corporate chief executives call @entity8 leaders			1
the business community has called for resolving the @entity0 stalemate to avoid a default that would spike interest rates to impact the economy			0
without a breakthrough , the shutdown would continue at a cost estimated at up to $ 50 billion a month			0
failure to raise the debt ceiling by next week 's deadline would leave the government unable to borrow money to pay its bills for the first time in its history			1
all the partisan bickering -- and lack of progress -- is taking its toll not just on furloughed workers , shuttered government facilities and programs , but also on @entity29 ' confidence in their government			0
poll : most angry at both parties shutdown forecast : week two and clouds ahead in a national poll released monday , most respondents said the government shutdown was causing a crisis or major problems for the country			2
the @entity1 / @entity296 survey indicated that slightly more people were angry at @entity137 than @entity14 or @entity4 for the shutdown , though both sides took a hit			2
according to the poll conducted over the weekend , 63 % of respondents said they were angry at the republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown , while 57 % expressed anger at @entity14 and 53 % at @entity4			2
" it looks like there is more than enough blame to go around , and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown , " said @entity1 polling director @entity306			0
according to a new @entity313 poll wednesday , the @entity8 's favorable rating dropped to 28 % , down 10 percentage points from september			0
the 43 % for @entity14 was a 4 - percentage - point drop from last month			0
will 2014 election solve anything ? @entity248 sought to keep up the pressure , holding a rally on the @entity321 steps on wednesday to demonstrate their unified stance in calling for @entity137 to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling			1
a @entity1 survey indicates enough @entity8 in the @entity13 would join @entity14 in voting for a @entity59 - passed spending plan to end the shutdown			1
all 200 @entity14 and 19 @entity8 support passing a continuing resolution with no additional legislative strings attached			0
with two vacancies in 435 - member @entity13 , 217 votes are currently the minimum needed for the measure to win approval in the @entity13			0
however , not enough @entity8 are willing to join @entity14 in a procedural move to force @entity45 to hold a vote on the @entity59 plan			2
@entity45 has said the measure would fail to pass in the @entity13 , a contention rejected by @entity4 and @entity14			0
the speaker has previously allowed measures to pass the @entity13 with mostly @entity3 support , which has weakened his leadership among conservatives			0
doing so now could cost him his leadership post due to the conservative backlash in would likely unleash , analysts believe			0
@entity1 's @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 and @entity355 contributed to this report .			0
