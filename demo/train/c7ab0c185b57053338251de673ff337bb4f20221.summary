-- the death of @entity2 has renewed comparisons to another great innovator who died 80 years ago this month -- @entity6			1
but there are important differences between the two men			0
in the 80 years between their deaths , consumers came to dominate the economy , a transformation that was only beginning during the later years of @entity6 's life			2
@entity2 was a master at understanding how to create transformative consumer technologies			1
although @entity6 was a key innovator in two consumer technologies -- sound recording and motion pictures -- he struggled to understand the consumer markets he helped to create			1
his most important technological innovation was the electrical system , which made possible the personal computers , music players and smartphones innovated by @entity2			1
@entity6 was also more involved in the day - to - day work of invention than @entity2 , and his other great innovation was the industrial research and development laboratory while the differences between @entity6 and @entity2 are important , so , are their similarities			1
these offer lessons for other innovators			0
@entity2 and @entity6 succeeded because they were good at envisioning how long - term developments in scientific and technical knowledge could be transformed into new technologies			1
at the start of his electric light research @entity6 described his vision for an entire electric light and power system and then used the knowledge of decades of research on incandescent lamps and generators to create the first viable incandescent lamp and the entire electric light and power system that made it commercially viable			1
similarly , before developing the @entity53 computer , @entity2 envisioned how two decades of work on graphical user interfaces and the computer mouse could transform the way people used computers , and also how the development of touchscreens and miniaturization could be transformed into the smartphone			2
in developing new technologies , both men focused on the long - term			0
they understood that innovation does not happen overnight and were willing to commit considerable resources to a process that might result in failure			0
in fact , both had notable commercial failures			0
with @entity2 it was the @entity74 computer , and with @entity6 it was a method for processing low - grade iron ore			1
neither was a technical failure , however , and they became successful elements in subsequent innovations			0
the software that drove the @entity74 computer became an important part of the @entity53 operating system , while @entity6 's rock - crushing technology was widely licensed			2
@entity6 himself used this technology to enter the @entity87 cement industry , where he became a major producer by innovating a long rotary kiln that became the industry standard			2
as part of their long - term vision of innovation , both @entity2 and @entity6 understood that a device that worked well experimentally might not be suited to everyday use			1
they therefore spent time and resources to ensure their technology was commercially viable before putting it on the market			0
@entity2 publicly demonstrated the first iphone six months before it was ready for the market			2
after his first public demonstration of a lamp and lighting system , @entity6 spent a year on further development before he introduced them commercially			2
and , after commercial introduction , both innovators continued to fund research to improve their products and keep them at the forefront of the market			0
nonetheless , both @entity6 and @entity2 were better at introducing transformative technologies than dominating the markets they created			1
finally , @entity6 and @entity2 were masters at using the media to promote both their products and themselves in ways that captured the public imagination			1
such promotion , however , was based on a solid foundation of innovation that helped to transform people 's lives			0
it is for this reason that president @entity133 asked @entity134 to dim their lights for a minute to honor @entity6 's memory			0
it 's also the reason that on news of @entity2 ' death , fans flocked to @entity142 stores and held vigils -- lit by @entity144			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			0

@entity147 says some have compared @entity2 impact to that of @entity6
he says there are differences : @entity6 not in tune with consumer markets but @entity2 was
he says both were good at *harnessing* scientific knowledge into transformative technologies
@entity162 : both had their product *missteps* but were masters at innovation and media promotion
