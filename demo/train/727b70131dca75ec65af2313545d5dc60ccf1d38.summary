-- to adapt to the new era of gaming , @entity1 is returning to its roots			1
the gaming pioneer -- which spearheaded arcade games and home video - game consoles -- is reinventing itself to adapt to the era of mobile and social games			1
@entity1 has been synonymous with games and gaming since @entity13 and @entity14 founded it in 1972			1
the company 's products , such as " @entity18 " and the @entity19 , helped define the computer entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid- 1980s			1
about five years ago , the company got away from developing its own games to focus on publishing and distribution			1
@entity19 ceo @entity25 said it was a complicated time for the company and the brand			1
" ( @entity19 ) got bought by this retail distribution company that focused primarily on building @entity31 brands and distributing third - party titles , " @entity25 said			1
" the @entity19 name was then being used as a corporate name on a retail distribution company			2
that did n't make any sense to me			0
" @entity25 wanted to take @entity1 back to its casual - gaming roots and recognized the best way to do so was to embrace the social and mobile change in the gaming landscape			1
he said there are new business models in gaming and the company finally is ready to take advantage of them			2
" what we 're doing is we 're going out to the best and the brightest of the developers in the mobile business , " he said			0
" we 're looking at different ways to reinterpret or reinvent our classic franchises in ways that people are playing games today in the business model that people are playing today			0
" @entity19 released " @entity19 's @entity64 " for the @entity65 in the spring of 2011 to a resounding cheer from fans			1
the game featured classic arcade games such as " @entity68 " ( @entity25 's favorite as a kid ) , " @entity71 " and " @entity72 " as well as games from the @entity19 home console such as " adventure , " " @entity76 " and " @entity77			1
" the game in the @entity79 has been downloaded more than 3.5 million times			0
it was recently made available in the @entity82 , further expanding the market for @entity19 products			2
" the great thing about @entity1 and its very brand is that it is recognizable , " @entity25 said			2
" you understand what it is , and frankly , in the @entity79 or the @entity82 , discoverability is a big issue for people who are releasing their games			0
one of the benefits of @entity19 is that it creates instant recognition and discoverability in the @entity79 and the @entity82			2
" @entity25 then focused on re-imagining some of @entity1 's classic titles to make them more appealing to today 's gaming audience			1
men older than 30 make up the company 's core audience , he said , so they 've grown up with @entity19 , and they have the money to spend on games			1
" what we 're looking to do is build games			0
some of our games are going to have a much more broad appeal and , for us , the ability to generate a community			0
" however , we also ( want ) to address a larger audience and that 's what it 's going to come down to -- making games that appeal to a broader audience			2
" " @entity120 " was the first game to be reinterpreted as " asteroids : @entity122 , " a top 10 best - seller in the @entity79 in its first two weeks in november			0
the free app game featured a new look and new weapons as well as the opportunity to purchase @entity127 inside the game to enhance players ' spaceships			0
" we believe there are multiple ways to reinterpret ' @entity120 , ' and ' @entity120 : gunner ' was a great opportunity for us to create a time - based , premium model that seemed to go over well with our core male audience , " @entity25 said			0
in december , the company released " breakout : boost , " which has garnered more than 2 million downloads in the @entity79 alone			0
the game offers five free levels and more than 200 others that can be purchased inside the game			0
it would be easy for @entity19 to continue to re-imagine and rerelease its classic titles , but @entity25 said to appeal to a broader audience , the company is also working with developers on original intellectual properties that fit the @entity19 brand			2
the company expects to release 10 to 15 new titles in the next year , with about five of those coming from outside developers , he said			0
they will hold true to the @entity19 brand but could appeal to those gamers outside the male - dominated , core audience of traditional @entity19 games			1
@entity25 is counting on a blend of reinterpreted classics and original games for the social and mobile gaming arena to drive @entity19 's business for the near future			1
the company has slimmed down to 65 employees , most of whom are targeting the mobile gaming platform			0
" if we stay true to the original brand ideas and we work with some of the best talent in the industry and we listen to our consumers , i think we have a very good opportunity to make a big statement and bring @entity19 to a new stage , " he said			2
" we have an opportunity to bring back a powerful brand that consumers know and love			0

@entity19 released " @entity19 's @entity64 " for the @entity65 last year
