-- the @entity2 nominations are being decided even as i write this			1
members of the @entity6 must hand in their ballots by june 28 ; the nominations will be announced on july 19			0
why do n't we help out these folks and suggest worthy candidates ? that 's the thinking behind the long , carefully reasoned , highly passionate , sometimes stubbornly flukey list that follows			1
as @entity0 's tv critic , i tend to have some opinions not shared by the majority of official @entity2 voters			1
i also suspect , however , that you , the @entity0 reader , share some of my passions -- such as " @entity22 , " " girls , " and " @entity24 " -- that the @entity6 is unlikely to nominate			0
which is one reason to agitate for them , right ? over the next couple of weeks , the entire @entity0 staff , a hardy band i would dub the @entity31 , will be interviewing actors , producers , and writers from the shows on the list below			1
the @entity38 brigade will also post clips of their best work as part of this great project			0
i 'm using the @entity44 's eligibility period ( june 1 , 2011 - may 31 , 2012 ) and you 're going to notice immediately that i exceeded the number of nominations possible in most categories			1
why ? because it 's a wish - list , and i wanted to expand these things here and there , to get in favorites , long shots , and , simply , the deserving			1
all of which is going to drive some of you nuts , i know , but that 's part of the fun , i hope : respond , argue , vote , and offer your own ballots for these categories			1
my wish - list begins below , deserving nominees in no order of preference -- it 's the democratic free - for - all way ! comedy series : @entity68 wish - list nominees : " @entity24 , " " @entity69 , " " @entity70 , " " girls , " " @entity72 , " " @entity73 , " " enlightened , " " @entity74 , " " @entity75 , " " @entity76 " with " girls , " " enlightened , " " @entity70 , " and " @entity24 , " it 's difficult to recall a season in which there were more major network ( broadcast and cable ) sitcoms that reshaped the genre the way these four have , each in a distinctively different manner			1
but i also think it was a very strong year for the mainstream sitcom â € ” and just a few years ago , many readers would think i was stretching it to call brilliantly eccentric shows such as @entity95 mainstream			1
but headed up by @entity69 , whose mastery of both middle - @entity102 sitcom conventions and mass appeal outreach shows so signs of exhaustion , this is a list that suggests the sitcom is in robust health			1
@entity106 : @entity68 wish - list nominees : " @entity108 , " " homeland , " " @entity110 , " " justified , " " @entity22 , " " @entity111 , " " @entity112 , " " revenge , " " @entity113 , " " parenthood " for me , " homeland " is the show to beat			1
no , " @entity108 " is			0
no , " @entity117 " is ... you see the " problem " here : we 're living in a new @entity119 of @entity106 ! ( a @entity120 ? ) ( a @entity121 ? ) add to this shows that do n't have a prayer of getting nominated , led by " @entity22 " and tailed by the artful trash of " @entity125 , " and you 've got an amazingly diverse range of possibilities			1
in another era , one not so dominated by cable , series such as " parenthood " and " @entity111 " would , i would assert , have won multiple emmys already			0
comedy actor : @entity68 wish - list nominees : @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 in contrast to other categories , this one yields the least number of nominees i am enthused about			1
( which is worth a post of its own : how did sitcoms become so dominated by women as their central characters ? ) but i like the opportunity to give a nod to a very good actor in a mediocre series ( that would be @entity139 / " @entity164 " ) , as well as the chance to remind readers that @entity141 has been doing excellently buffoonish work on " it 's @entity162 in @entity163			2
" and of course i 'm really pulling for @entity138			0
comedy actress : @entity68 wish - list nominees : @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 what a formidable group of performers we have here			1
@entity168 took " @entity72 's " political - campaign storyline and invested it with strong emotion as well as assiduous hilarity			2
you might call @entity170 's portrayal of @entity183 in " girls " minimalist or mumble - core - y ; i 'd call it marvelously sly			2
and @entity169 : holy cow , she turned " @entity194 " into a showcase for comic acting that carried the weight of the most riveting drama			0
plus , @entity171 is giving a great performance in a show , " @entity199 , " that has n't quite lived up to its initial promise			2
a fascinating category by any measure			0
drama actor : @entity68 wish - list nominees : @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 the formidable trio of @entity206 , @entity207 , and @entity204 ought to be joined by @entity205 , whose work on @entity22 is fully the equal to the trio 's , and i would definitely include @entity209 for his work on " luck , " despite the fact that the abrupt cancellation of that daring series did not allow for what would doubtless have been the full flowering of what @entity209 had planted in his first season 's labor			1
drama actress : @entity68 wish - list nominees : @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 this category is comparable to what i was saying in the @entity236 segment : there are n't as many first - rate showcases for lead women as there are for men in dramas			1
that stipulated , i believe @entity231 's various shadings of the multiple - universe @entity245 in " @entity22 " was highly emmy - worthy work			2
i also think that @entity230 has been somewhat overlooked in all the praise for " @entity249 " -- her lovely approach to her character is a model of restrained yet highly effective acting			0
whether or not this proved to be @entity228 ' swan - song on " @entity110 , " her performance was remarkable , as she moved @entity257 from dutiful , imaginative agency cog to a wise - verging - on - cynical woman who you can bet deserved that kiss of fealty @entity262 bestowed upon her hand			0
and all that said , @entity226 is the one to beat , i 'd wager			0
supporting actor comedy : @entity68 wish - list nominees : @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 this is the category in which @entity2 voters really need to widen their field of vision			1
if you do n't grant that @entity271 and @entity272 in " @entity24 , " and @entity276 and @entity275 in " @entity95 , " are doing some of the most adroit acting on television , well , it 's time for a revolution , comrades ! and @entity273 got some wonderful showcases for his fully fleshed - out creation in " @entity69 " this season			2
supporting actor drama : @entity68 wish - list nominees : @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 yes , this is one loaded - up list			1
but there 's no one i could not suggest for nomination here			2
the suggestions of @entity295 , @entity294 , @entity310 , @entity296 , and @entity297 are all no - brainers			0
( in the case of @entity310 's @entity314 , it 's literally a half - brainer			2
) but look at the rest of my picks			2
@entity300 frequently carried the killing through its weaker episodes this season on his skinny frame			0
@entity303 made a leap in his acting when presented with some juicy subplots on " @entity325			0
" ( except for that romance with @entity328 , that is			0
) and @entity298 was -- i agree with a remark producer - writer @entity331 made to me â € ” " the soul of ' @entity333			0
' " my left - field selection here , or so it might seem to you , is " @entity337 's " @entity299 , but i would argue that his pumped - up , out - size performance was the best thing about that over-inflated , ultimately disappointing series			2
supporting actress comedy : @entity68 wish - list nominees : @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 as in the corresponding male category , new blood is needed here			1
@entity345 and @entity344 in " @entity24 , " @entity347 in " @entity74 , " and @entity346 in " @entity76 " all deserve to be recognized for their varying approaches to wackiness			0
and as reader - divisive a figure as " @entity360 's " @entity349 can be ( i know from my time recapping " snl " that there 's no quicker way to provoke a deluge of comments than to bring up , say , @entity366 ) , she merits a spot here for her final - season , post- " bridesmaids " relentless work ethic - plus - talent			2
finally , @entity348 ' work on " girls " might actually be underrated by her casting as the sad - pretty - girl contrast to roommate @entity183 , but she really pulled off a tricky role with deftness			0
supporting actress drama : @entity68 wish - list nominees : @entity376 , @entity377 , @entity378 , @entity379 , @entity380 , @entity381 here is the most enjoyably motley group of nominees			1
while @entity378 and @entity377 are sure - things for official @entity2 voters , i would add the firm swagger of @entity381 in " @entity117 , " the hip - swiveling heinousness that @entity376 projects in " @entity125 , " and @entity380 's " @entity108 " performance , which only increases with controlled intensity every season			1
so @entity0 's @entity68 begins			0
