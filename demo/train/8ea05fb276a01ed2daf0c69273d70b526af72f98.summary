@entity0 -- step by step , die - hard conservatives are confronting their grief over president @entity6 's re-election			1
but judging from blog posts and other public pronouncements , many remain stuck somewhere between denial and anger , very far from acceptance			0
so far this week , prolific blogger @entity13 on @entity13 has called for boycotting the @entity14 to prevent validating the election result and lamented the triumph of liberalism in destroying national unity and therefore @entity20 's greatness			1
over at @entity22 , a more sophisticated political analysis echoes calls by @entity25 leaders to better communicate conservative principles instead of softening or dropping them			2
founder and @entity1 contributor @entity29 , who rejected any talk of electoral fraud or an unfair @entity6 victory , wrote tuesday that " there 'll be no hand - wringing here and there sure as hell wo n't be any apologies for fighting for what we believe in			1
" " republicans are not successful when they run campaigns as the rich patrician out to make government more efficient so it can be more helpful , " said another @entity29 post tuesday			0
" republicans win with conservative populists who run as men who pulled themselves up in life fighting big government and its cronies			2
" some acceptance has been necessary			0
on tuesday , tea party favorite rep. @entity52 of @entity54 conceded in his race for re-election after initially alleging electoral fraud			1
@entity58 of the discussion focuses on the changing demographics of the country , identified by exit polls and many analysts as a major factor in both @entity6 's 2008 victory to become the nation 's first @entity67 - @entity20 president and his re-election on november 6			1
in particular , @entity6 received overwhelming support from the nation 's fastest - growing demographic -- hispanic @entity20 -- to cause some high - profile conservatives including @entity74 and television host @entity75 to soften their stance on immigration reform			1
overall , though , hard - core conservatives continue to reject that they are a minority in a country built on the core principle of liberty that they embrace			1
instead , the initial reactions and subsequent attempts to explain what happened sought scapegoats , such as what right - wing critics describe as a deficient @entity25 challenger in @entity92 , electoral theft or a liberal - dominated media industry that is part of a broader @entity97 effort dating back decades to undermine the nation			1
study : @entity101 , @entity100 got more extreme on november 10 , @entity13 alleged that more votes than registered voters in several @entity54 precincts were part of @entity107 efforts to " steal the election " against @entity52			0
there was no immediate posting tuesday in response to @entity52 's concession			0
six days later , @entity13 took aim at @entity92 , calling the former @entity115 governor a " flip - flopping liberal who ran a content - free campaign			1
" in a response to @entity13 ' post , one writer ranted about what he alleged were " the sexual perversions and drug use of the @entity125 , " the president 's " forged birth certificate " and " voter fraud of biblical proportions			2
" " why are we talking secession instead of removing the @entity136 and supporting citizens ' grand jury indicments against this unbelievable treason , felonies and usurpations raining down on us on a daily basis ? " said the post attributed to @entity131 of @entity132 , @entity133			0
@entity143 : do n't dismiss secession talk on sunday , @entity13 proposed an action plan -- getting @entity14 voters in states won by @entity92 to boycott the validation of the election result by the december 17 deadline			1
" the 12th amendment specifies the quorum or the necessary number of states for the college to act , is 2/3 , " @entity13 wrote			0
" in other words , if 17 states refuse to participate , the @entity14 does not have a quorum			1
" without a quorum to decide the presidency , he continued , the @entity25 - led @entity20 @entity158 will decide and presumably choose @entity92			1
@entity13 acknowledged such a move would set a " dangerous precedent , " but added that " the situation is so grim we really have no other choice			0
" " does anyone really believe @entity20 can survive four more years of @entity6 ? " he wrote , saying the president will seek to " transform @entity20 from that shining city on a hill into a third world shantytown , with massive unemployment and a corrupt government			1
" what 's next for @entity6 election organization ? the next day , @entity13 sounded more resigned , lamenting what he called " the triumph of liberalism in @entity20 " that he said was " destroying our national unity and by extension destroying the freedom			1
" " in @entity20 , until now we have always identified ourselves as @entity20 , " he wrote			2
" the balkanization that has been pushed by the hard left has one goal in mind			2
that is the end of @entity20 as a great nation			2
they are perilously close to succeeding			0
" tuesday brought his attack on a carbon tax being discussed by some on both sides in @entity195 as a step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contributed to climate change			0
while challenging " the mythical man - made global warming , " @entity13 also said a carbon tax would create a " massive new tax stream " for liberals bent on growing government			2
@entity204 : greenhouse gases set record in 2011 the focus on a single issue certain to generate legislative and public debate signaled some change in the response to the election			0
to @entity215 and other conservatives , any increase in revenue goes against their goal of shrinking the federal government by cutting spending			2
" it is time for conservative activists to make the case to the @entity20 people that we have far more government than we can afford , or than we want , no matter what our politicians may think , or what deals they may be willing to cut with each other to keep spending other people 's money until we are all bankrupt , " said a tuesday post on @entity13 by @entity221 of @entity222 , @entity223			1
@entity25 , @entity107 seek common ground on fiscal cliff @entity221 called for " organizing voters to rein in the politicians , rather than let them keep playing the game by their rules with our money			0
" " it 's worth your effort to organize voters in your community and apply real political pressure for change , because if we just keep playing the game by their rules , your own financial situation will keep getting worse , rather than better , " he continued			0
" the politicians keep offering free stuff with other people 's money , playing us all for fools			0
it 's time to wake up the voters in every corner of @entity20 to the fact that they have been conned by these snake oil salesmen and their well - rehearsed lies and false promises , " @entity221 said			1
in the end , a reviled @entity267 in the @entity158 may mean more followers of conservative websites such as @entity13 and @entity22			0
no one seems happy about the better business prospects , at least for now .			0
