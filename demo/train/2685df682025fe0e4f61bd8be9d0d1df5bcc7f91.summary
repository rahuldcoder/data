@entity1 , @entity0 -- bodies lie scattered in a rural field in the southern @entity0 , some unearthed from a shallow grave hastily dug by the gunmen who seized the group of men and women just a day earlier			1
by tuesday , search teams had found a total of 46 bodies , and it was still unclear if there were more victims from monday 's massacre			1
the target was a group that included the female relatives of @entity20 , who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of @entity24 in may			1
@entity20 said he had received threats which he believed were from allies of the incumbent governor @entity27 -- that he would be kidnapped if he filed the candidate papers himself			1
instead , his wife , sister , and the group of journalists accompanying them were kidnapped and brutally killed , possibly tortured , raped and beheaded , according to local media reports			1
a local police commander described the grisly search operation near an isolated village , telling reporters from @entity38 that 17 bodies were pulled from a single grave			1
" they were piled on top of each other , " chief superintendent @entity41 said			1
" it looked as if they were buried hurriedly			2
" those killed included at least 12 journalists , according to the press freedom organization , @entity50 , making monday the deadliest single day for journalists anywhere in the world			2
it was also the worst politically motivated violence in the @entity0 ' recent history			1
witnesses , local officials and analysts have blamed the attacks on @entity27 , who has controlled the area for a decade and is a long - time ally of @entity0 president @entity61			1
@entity27 , who is known locally as a warlord , reportedly commands a private army of nearly 500 men			0
@entity0 military officials also said monday that the gunmen who carried out the attack were loyal to @entity27			1
neither @entity27 nor any of his advisers has commented on the slaying allegations			0
" it 's not hard to determine the motive , " according to @entity0 analyst @entity72			1
" how dare this [ @entity74 ] challenge him when he knows that the governor is a position that is presumably reserved for [ the @entity27 ] family			0
" @entity27 reportedly wanted one of his sons to succeed him as governor of @entity24 when he stepped down next year , according to @entity38			0
a government construction vehicle was found at the site of the hastily dug mass grave , fueling the belief that @entity27 or his allies had a role in the massacre			2
both the @entity27 and @entity74 clans have agreed to participate in the government 's investigation into the killings , according to @entity61 's adviser on the @entity95 region , @entity96 , who spoke to the @entity0 media on tuesday			1
neither @entity27 nor his advisers have spoken publicly about the widespread allegations , and that is most likely because he is " weighing his options , " @entity72 said			0
now , the region is bracing for a backlash of possible reprisal killings			0
the @entity0 government has placed @entity24 and its surrounding regions under a state of emergency and survivors of monday 's massacre have entered a government witness protection program , according to the state - run @entity113			1
@entity61 has sent top level government officials to @entity24 to " personally oversee military action against the perpetrators of the dastardly acts , " she said tuesday			0
" no effort has been spared to bring justice to the victims and hold the perpetrators accountable to the full limit of the law , " she said			0
long - running family disputes in the southern @entity0 have spilled innocent blood before			1
such blood feuds are known by the indigenous term , " rido			0
" but monday 's massacre has broader implications , @entity72 said			2
" i think that this is a culmination for many years of impunity on the part of any family or group for that matter because this has been tolerated by the @entity61 administration , " said @entity72 , a political science associate professor at @entity130 in @entity131 , who is from @entity95 and has authored several books on the region and its politics			0
" so when the administration looks the other way when journalists report on military abuses [ or ] when the administration looks the other way when church workers are assassinated , when environmental workers are assassinated or abducted , you know , this [ massacre ] is just one or two steps away [ from that ]			2
" the killings could further damage the political reputation of @entity61 , whose administration has already been scarred by allegations of a tainted election in 2004 and criticism over her response to the recent typhoons to strike the country			2
" it 's a test as to what how far the @entity61 administration will go to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators , " @entity72 said			0
@entity61 's term ends in may 2010 , and she can not seek re-election although there has been speculation that she could seek another political office			0
@entity24 is part of an autonomous region in predominantly @entity95 which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent @entity177 homeland in the @entity0 , a predominantly @entity178 country			1
negotiations between one of those armed groups , the @entity182 , and the @entity0 government broke down last year after the country 's @entity184 blocked a proposed peace deal that would have increased the size and scope of the @entity189 in @entity95			1
@entity61 's government exercises little control in the region and is blamed by her critics for helping legitimize many of the armed groups that operate freely in @entity95 , including those loyal to the governor , @entity27			0
@entity61 issued an executive order in july 2006 that allowed local officials and @entity200 to deputize volunteer watchmen , known as barangay tanods , to fight against insurgent groups in the southern regions			2
this order has been blamed for allowing local politicians to convert their private militias into legal security forces			2
the strong clan rivalries and the armed groups that support each clan may make it impossible for @entity61 to rout out those behind monday 's mass killing , according to @entity72			0
" the dynasty is strongly entrenched and for her to disband private armies by this warlord overnight is too much of a task , " he said			0
" the @entity218 were not able to do it in half a century and all she can do is set her sights low by really going after the most visible of the perpetrators			0
" @entity2 's @entity222 and journalist @entity223 contributed to this report .			0
