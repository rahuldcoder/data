-- a sci - fi reboot and kiddie sequel were no match for the third weekend of @entity6 's blockbuster @entity8 finale			1
@entity9 led the box office for a third weekend in a row , grossing $ 36.4 million and giving @entity13 ' $ 250 million - budgeted @entity8 sequel $ 354.6 million domestically after 17 days			1
the film enjoyed a healthy 41 percent decline from its previous frame , and if its weekend estimate holds up , rises will have notched a slimmer third weekend drop than @entity20 , which fell 43 percent to $ 42.7 million during its third weekend , thereby lifting its total to $ 393.8 million			1
the slim drop does not mean that @entity17 will outgross @entity20 domestically — it has virtually no chance of catching its $ 533.3 million total — but it may very well outdo its predecessor worldwide thanks to stronger international grosses			1
@entity20 grossed $ 468.6 million overseas , which gave it a jaw - dropping $ 1.002 billion cume worldwide			1
after three weekends , @entity17 has earned $ 378.4 million internationally ( for a $ 733 million worldwide total ) , and it looks like it is headed past the $ 1 billion mark as well			1
although naysayers may point out that @entity9 is performing below original domestic expectations , the film is clearly a hit			1
' @entity36 ' : ' @entity38 ' thoughts ? @entity40 reboot @entity39 started its run in second place with $ 26 million , only a touch higher than 1990 ′ s @entity39 , which starred @entity44 and opened with $ 25.5 million			1
if we adjust for inflation , the 1990 version , which ultimately grossed $ 119.4 million , opened to the equivalent of about $ 45 million and earned about $ 215 million in today 's dollars			2
@entity40 says it spent $ 125 million on the reboot ( some reports suggest the budget reached $ 200 million ) , but with poor reviews and a weak " @entity53 , the film will almost certainly not recoup its budget ( or its marketing costs ) domestically			1
for star @entity57 , whose career held such promise in the early 2000s , @entity39 is the latest in a long line of box office misfires			1
with the exception of @entity64 ( in which @entity57 appeared in a supporting role ) , every wide release he has led since 2004 ′ s @entity67 has sputtered financially			2
@entity67 grossed $ 34.3 million against a whopping $ 155 million budget			2
2006 ′ s @entity69 earned $ 63.5 million against a $ 135 million budget			2
2008 ′ s @entity71 and 2011 ′ s @entity72 , both of which cost $ 30 million , earned only $ 15.8 million and $ 18.3 million , respectively			2
' @entity74 ' : ' @entity76 ' poster @entity77 : @entity78 took third place with $ 14.7 million , the lowest debut by far for a @entity82 film			1
the original diary started with $ 22.1 million in 2010 , and the sequel @entity84 began with $ 23.8 million in 2011			2
notably , both those films opened in march rather than the relative dead zone of august			2
on the other hand , @entity78 will likely see better weekday grosses than its predecessors thanks to schools being out for the summer			2
@entity91 spent $ 22 million on @entity78 , and though it wo n't be a smash for the studio , it certainly wo n't be a pock on its record			0
still , the franchise 's viability may be in question following the low opening			0
the young target audience for the @entity82 films , many of whom read the popular books the films are based on , may well have outgrown the franchise in just two years			0
@entity91 will need to lure new viewers in order to maintain box office viability			1
fortunately , audiences — which were 58 percent female and 62 percent below the age of 25 — liked what they saw and issued the film an " a- " @entity53 , which should lead to good word - of - mouth			1
' @entity118 ' moving to summer 2013 two more @entity91 films filled up the next two spots on the chart			0
ice age : @entity123 finished its fourth weekend in fourth place , dipping 37 percent to $ 8.4 million			0
the frozen ' toon has earned $ 131.9 million total			0
last weekend 's underperforming comedy @entity128 continued its sorry run , falling 50 percent to $ 6.4 million			0
after 10 days , the @entity133 / @entity132 / @entity131 vehicle has earned a sad $ 25.4 million against a $ 68 million budget			0
two films reached major milestones this weekend			0
in sixth place , @entity137 earned another $ 5.5 million , which pushed its total past $ 200 million			0
the comedy , which has earned $ 203.4 million domestically against a $ 50 million budget , has a chance of becoming @entity145 's biggest hit this year if it passes @entity147 's $ 214 million cume			0
it 's also cleaning up overseas , where it has earned $ 77.3 million ( including $ 14.3 million in the @entity150 this weekend ) early in its run			0
in eighth place , @entity40 's @entity152 reached $ 250.7 million during its fifth weekend			0
the franchise reboot is just shy of $ 700 million worldwide			0
@entity9 -- $ 36.4 million 2			1
@entity39 -- $ 26.0 million 3			1
@entity77 : dog days -- $ 14.7 million 4			1
