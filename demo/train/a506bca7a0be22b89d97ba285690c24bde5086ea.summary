@entity0 , @entity1 -- many people are struggling just to provide the basics these days			2
the big question is , how do you find joy and fulfillment during lean holiday times like these ? for the answer , i look back upon the philosophy by which my mother , @entity14 , led her life , through both its brightest and darkest hours			1
her philosophy originated during @entity17 through her experiences as a prisoner of war in a @entity21 concentration camp in @entity22			1
she had lived in that country with an abusive husband , whom she left before the war broke out and the @entity21 captured her			0
through the bleakest times , she reached out to her fellow prisoners to provide them with comfort and care			2
the lack of medical supplies meant care was n't much more than holding someone 's hand or sharing some of her starvation rations			2
while not a nurse , she gave of herself and drew a sustaining love in return			2
returning to @entity40 after the war , my mother remarried and started a family , which grew to include me and my two sisters			2
with the camp behind her , my mother 's philosophy remained to always keep an open heart			1
she volunteered with the @entity49 and regularly provided emotional support for friends			0
she found that when love flows with no boundaries from an open heart , love also finds its way back in			1
she gave and gave , and received love in return			2
this " open heart " philosophy has sustained me , as well , through the most difficult of times , including a painful divorce about 20 years ago that left me near penniless			1
at that point in my life , i attended a fundraiser for @entity66			0
i donated some of the last money i had , and in return , i secured a session where an artist drew a picture of my two children at the time			0
at that sitting , the artist saw potential in some finger paintings i 'd made for my children and offered to give me free painting lessons			2
as i started painting , i discovered my emotional outlet			0
i began creating images of hearts that were always open , never closed			1
these hearts may have appeared unfinished in a way			2
but they brought me back to the lessons of my mother , a reminder to live as she lived -- openhearted			0
soon , i changed from a frantic , terrified and angry person into someone who was able to let go of the past			0
i began to let other people into my life and to give back emotionally			1
around that same time , i landed the tv role of " dr. quinn , medicine woman " and was back on my feet			0
i now embody my mother 's belief that only when you can love yourself and keep your heart open can you best give and receive love			1
my family continues my mother 's tradition at @entity106 , when we open our home to relatives , neighbors , my six children and even their friends -- extending our family to include those unable to head home for the holidays			1
some years , there are as many as 50 people at the dinner table			0
living with an open heart can be a path to rewarding holidays for many people this year , even if budgets tighten and troubles mount			1
the holiday table may be less bountiful			0
there may be fewer presents under the tree			0
but an open heart can bring a wealth of love , hope and inspiration			1
you might think these are shaping up to be your gloomiest holidays ever			0
but remember , as my mother taught me , someone is always worse off than you			0
find a way to give , even if you 're in need yourself			1
find the place where you can provide comfort , care or love			1
volunteer at a food bank or a shelter			0
reach out to elderly neighbors to find out how you might make their lives a little easier			0
by opening your heart to others , good things will come to you , too			0
with that approach , i hope you 'll find that 2009 could become the most fulfilling of holiday seasons			1
