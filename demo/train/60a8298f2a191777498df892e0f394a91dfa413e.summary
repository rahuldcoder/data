from bombs to drugs , humans have long relied on dogs ' astonishing sense of smell to sniff out danger			1
now , our four - legged friends are also helping to combat poaching			2
@entity10 and @entity11 , two energetic , highly driven and undeniable cute canines that are @entity14 's latest recruits in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade			1
the determined trackers are specially trained to use their nose for odor to detect endangered wildlife and plant species , such as ivory , leopard skin , shark fin , iboga tree products and primate meat			1

accompanied by their trained handlers they search luggage at the international airport and do checks at the train station , they sniff containers at the city port and they are deployed at roadblocks , picking up scents inside vehicles			1
" these dogs would work until they drop , they will do anything to get their tennis ball , " says @entity48 of the @entity49 , which provides technical support to the @entity14 national park agency ( @entity51 )			1
" they are extremely energetic and very driven -- making quick work of previously arduous searches			0
it 's the handlers that have to keep up and ensure the dogs ' safety			2
" read this : could horn sale end rhino slaughter ? world - class sniffers @entity67 , director and head of training at @entity70 , the detection dogs company that provided @entity51 with @entity10 and @entity11 , says the sniffer dogs ' biggest advantage is their ability to search fast , efficiently and without bias			2
" say you have 300 bags for a human team to search , humans would have to open every single bag and look through every single box or wrapped up item in that bag , " says @entity76			0
" a dog does n't need to do that ; a dog can easily run over each bag and spend three seconds per bag sniffing it to be able to find the illegal item , " she adds			1
in addition to speeding up the searches , @entity93 , the @entity51 coordinator for the sniffer dogs unit , says the canines are providing law enforcement agents with valuable information that helps improve park protection			1
" during a search operation the dog performs the so - called ' light ' ( search ) , " he says			2
" where it may have found something , agents proceed in more depth			0
" rampant poaching @entity14 , a beautiful country on the @entity110 coast , is a haven for a variety of wildlife and plant species			1
about 75 % of the country is covered by a dense and pristine rainforest sheltering elephants , antelopes , gorillas and numerous tropical birds			0
yet a recent surge in poaching , fueled by the growing demand for ivory products in @entity123 , has led to the decimation of many of the animals populating @entity14 's national parks			1
more than 11,000 elephants have been slaughtered by poachers since 2004 , according to a recent survey			0

" it 's increasingly becoming organized crime , and this makes the ivory trade similar to the drug trade so we need to use similar methodology to combat it , " she adds			2
@entity10 and @entity11 faced with this shocking reality , conservations started exploring innovative ways to tackle the problem			0
in january 2012 , the @entity14 authorities invited @entity70 to run a feasibility study and gauge whether dogs could improve the detection rate of prohibited products in the country			1
a few months later , the project was given the green light and @entity160 was handed the hard task of finding two dogs in the @entity70 that would suit @entity14 's environment			1
what followed was an intense eight - week training period			0
@entity76 says it was crucial to find high - energy dogs that could cope with intense heat ; the recruits also needed to be non-aggressive looking , since they 'd be mainly working in public spaces , and also feel comfortable being around people that might not be used to handling dogs			2
" we probably had to work with about 350 dogs , if not more , " says @entity76			2
in the end , @entity10 , a very enthusiastic , lemon - colored cocker spaniel , and @entity11 , a calmer , intelligent , reddish small @entity177 , were chosen			0
" @entity11 likes to work alongside a handler , whereas @entity10 is a bit more independent , " says @entity76			0
" @entity10 likes to push the handler into the area where he wants to search , rather the other way around , " she adds			0
" their two characteristics are so different but as a team it works perfectly			0
" encouraging results the government - funded project became operational in late april , following a three - month training course for the dogs ' handlers			2
so far , conservationists say , the results have been very encouraging			0
" it 's more successful than i imagined , " says @entity48			0
" we 've not yet had a big find , for example , whole tusks hidden in shipping containers , but we 're continually getting small quantities of worked ivory , dried shark fin and bushmeat , " she adds			0
in addition to what the canines are finding , the existence of the sniffer dogs unit has motivated the other law enforcement agents to do their job even more rigorously , says @entity48			1
" a friendly competition has been set up between the dog team and the customs team ( about ) who 'll find the most ivory , " says @entity48			1
" it 's a nice knock - on effect that was unexpected			0
" looking ahead , officials say they plan to gradually build up the unit , deploying 16 dogs over the next five to 10 years			1
until then , however , @entity10 and @entity11 will keep on sniffing to help save @entity14 's elephants and other endangered species -- and get to play with their tennis ball .			1

@entity14 has launched a dog unit to fight poaching
two dogs are sweeping pinch points , sniffing vehicles , cargo and luggage
they are trained to detect ivory and other endangered species
there are plans to expand the dog unit in the future
