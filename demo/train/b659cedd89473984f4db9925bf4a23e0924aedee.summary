@entity1 's affiliate in @entity2 -- @entity0 -- strongly rebuked @entity3 in a video released friday , declaring @entity3 leader @entity6 's declaration of an @entity8 caliphate to be illegitimate			1
the statement , delivered by one of @entity0 's top clerics -- @entity12 -- is a significant setback to @entity3 efforts to assume leadership of the global jihadist movement a week after groups in @entity18 and @entity19 joined the @entity3 fold			1
@entity3 and @entity0 's top leadership in @entity22 had a bitter falling out earlier this year , and @entity0 and @entity3 fighters have been fighting each other in @entity25 , but @entity0 had until now stayed above the fray , calling for both sides to reconcile and pool resources to strike the @entity29			2
but when @entity31 declared in an audiotape released last week his @entity33 had expanded to @entity2 , as well as other @entity36 countries , it was too much for the @entity0 leadership to stomach			1
by claiming @entity2 for his caliphate , @entity31 had called into question the very right of @entity0 to exist as a separate and autonomous jihadi group , leaving its leadership no choice but to push back			1
" we did not want to talk about the current dispute and the sedition in @entity25 ... however , our brothers in the @entity33 ... surprised us with several steps , including their announcement of the caliphate [ and ] they announced the expansion of the caliphate in a number of countries which they have have no governance , and considered them to be provinces that belonged to them , " @entity12 stated , according to a translation by the site intelligence group			0
" the announcement of the caliphate for all @entity66 by our brothers in the @entity33 did not meet the required conditions , " @entity62 argued , because other jihadi groups were not consulted			0
the cleric also criticized @entity3 for " going too far in interpretations in terms of spilling inviolable blood under the excuse of expanding and spreading the power of the @entity33			0
" and in a repudiation of @entity31 's claim to supremacy among jihadis , he reaffirmed the group 's pledge of allegiance to @entity0 leader @entity81 and @entity83 leader @entity82			1
in forcing @entity0 to publicly choose sides , @entity31 appears to have badly miscalculated			2
@entity0 leader @entity85 , despite being named the number two of @entity0 globally by @entity81 last year , had been careful not to weigh in publicly on the dispute between @entity0 and @entity3 , restricting himself only to a poem he released in july praising his @entity18 boss			2
in february , the general command of @entity0 declared it had severed ties with @entity3 because of its insubordination and its brutal tactics against fellow @entity66			2
by then , @entity94 , @entity0 's affiliate in @entity25 , and @entity3 were already fighting each other in parts of northern @entity25			2
although @entity29 airstrikes against both groups in recent weeks have led to ceasefires and some cooperation at the local level against moderate rebel groups , relations have remained tense			0
@entity0 divisions over @entity3 the @entity0 leadership 's rebuke of @entity3 is not likely to go down well with all its members			2
@entity85 had avoided previously criticizing @entity31 because he feared it might exacerbate divisions inside his own group			0
@entity3 's rapid territorial expansion in @entity112 and @entity25 electrified many jihadis in @entity2 , and led to disagreements within the group			1
" we have discussed that which resulted from the dispute and the infighting in @entity121 ( @entity25 ) with debate and argument ... however , we pardoned those who raised such issues , " @entity12 acknowledged in the video released friday			0
everything to know about the rise of @entity3 in january , one mid-level @entity0 figure -- @entity129 -- tweeted his support for @entity3 as its feud with @entity0 heated up , prompting speculation of discord within its ranks			2
this past summer , @entity135 , a leading @entity2 salafi - jihadi preacher long admired by @entity0 , also came out in support for @entity3 , asking his large number of followers in @entity2 to do the same			1
the @entity29 air campaign against @entity3 further boosted the popularity of @entity3 in @entity2 jihadi circles , prompting @entity0 to release a message of solidarity			1
" their blood is our blood , and their wounds are in our hearts , and supporting them is a duty upon us			0
once we find a way to afflict @entity29 , we will follow it , @entity152 permitting , " the group stated in a statement posted on @entity155 on august 14 , and translated by @entity156			0
even in disagreement , respect all this has made @entity0 leaders tread carefully			0
even in rebuking @entity3 , @entity0 's @entity12 was careful to refer to @entity31 respectfully as " sheikh			1
" the cleric expressed hope that divisions between @entity3 and @entity164 could be healed and left the door open for fences to be mended between @entity0 and @entity3 if @entity31 withdrew his fatwa claiming @entity2 for his caliphate			1
" we express our utmost joy to having received good news about what we heard of signs of stopping the infighting among the mujahideen in the @entity176 [ @entity25 ] , " @entity12 stated			0
despite the possibility of growing discord within @entity0 , there are no signs of any immediate threat to @entity85 's leadership			0
to date , no senior leader within @entity0 has broken ranks and come out in favor of @entity3			2
@entity85 , by all accounts , remains exceptionally popular with the group 's rank - and file - fighters , who have been energized by a call to arms to fight @entity194 fighters who recently took control of @entity196			0
but @entity0 's rebuke of @entity3 increases the chances of a splinter group emerging			1
last week , a group calling itself @entity201 in @entity2 recorded a tape pledging loyalty to @entity204			0
@entity18 terror group pledges alliance to @entity3 for @entity3 , the rebuke by @entity0 is a significant setback after recent wins elsewhere in the region in its jockeying with @entity0 for pre-eminence in the global jihadi movement			1
last week , @entity214 , an increasingly powerful @entity18 group based in the @entity215 , declared allegiance to @entity31 , as did veteran @entity19 @entity3 fighters who have taken control of @entity219 , a major town in eastern @entity19			1
small splinter factions of the @entity22 @entity83 and @entity0 in @entity221 , as well as a group of fighters in @entity224 , also declared their support			0
the @entity0 move may see the @entity2 group step up cooperation with @entity94 in @entity25			1
@entity29 officials believe @entity0 has shared sophisticated bomb - making technology with the @entity231 , a @entity94 - linked outfit of veteran @entity0 operatives plotting terrorist attacks against @entity236 aviation			0
the prospects of @entity3 also receiving such bomb - making know - how from the @entity2 group appear to have dimmed			1
why @entity3 is spreading across @entity8 world			0
