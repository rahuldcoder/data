-- the @entity2 oil spill has brought into the public 's eye the tragedy of oiled wildlife			1
the pictures last week of pelicans completely covered in oil were horrific and rightly produced an outcry of rage from the public			0
should these birds , and other oiled wildlife , be saved ? much like the struggle to contain the oil itself , there are no quick fixes or easy answers			1
first , we need to emphasize that rescue and rehabilitation of oiled wildlife must be performed by trained wildlife professionals and volunteers			2
without proper training , would - be rescuers can inadvertently harm or further stress oiled wildlife or be harmed themselves , either by struggling animals or the oil itself			2
rescuers must go through a weeklong training on the handling of hazardous materials as well as proper wildlife rescue techniques			0
it is more than simply retrieving , washing and releasing wildlife contaminated with oil			0
rehabilitators not only clean wildlife but provide veterinary care and feeding			0
some animals are desperately ill , while others may need only minimal care			0
each animal is individually assessed and then treated appropriately			0
experts may make the difficult decision that some creatures ca n't be saved			2
read why some experts say birds should be euthanized even if we do everything right , the long - term survival of rehabilitated wildlife may be uncertain			1
beyond the short - term threats of oil poisoning and hypothermia , surviving wildlife face potential loss of their food sources and habitat			0
and it 's not as simple as moving affected individuals to a new location -- if a species moved 500 miles away from where it was originally lived , it might not be able to locate food and in some cases might even return to the original , oil - polluted location			1
wildlife at risk from the @entity2 oil spill include five species of threatened or endangered sea turtles , including the most endangered sea turtle in the world , the @entity82 , which is largely dependent on the @entity83			1
the brown pelican , in addition to having symbolic importance as @entity88 's state bird , was only recently taken off the @entity89			0
for species that are threatened or endangered , every individual is critically important to help contribute to the survival of these species			1
some have argued that we should n't bother to try to save any oiled birds , that given the long odds many face , we should simply euthanize all of them			1
that line of thinking overlooks recent advances in wildlife rehabilitation			0
it also lumps the sickest birds together with ones that may only be mildly ill. more broadly , it misses the point that this is n't just about playing the percentages			2
@entity108 is an important factor in the decision to rehabilitate oiled animals			2
people caused this problem , and many feel it is our ethical duty to try to help the wildlife suffering as a result , even if the task is difficult and the outcome uncertain			1
at the @entity122 , we 've heard from so many @entity123 who feel a sense of helplessness as the oil continues to gush and as @entity2 's attempts to stop it continue to fail			2
knowing that efforts are being made to save the innocent wildlife victims of this disaster not only helps the emotional stress of the public , it also gives them hope and rallies them to get involved , whether it 's making a donation to the response effort or contacting their elected officials			1
the sad reality is that many of the @entity83 's most critical species are now swimming against the current			2
rehabilitation is difficult , and survival is uncertain			1
this only underscores the critical importance of clean energy and climate legislation now so we can prevent these disasters from happening in the future			0
that 's the only real way to ensure that we do n't have to see more images of oiled wildlife struggling and dying in disasters of our own making			1
the best way to help personally is to give , which you can do by texting wildlife to 20222 to donate $ 10 to the @entity158			0
if you 're in @entity88 and want to report oiled wildlife , call ( 866 ) 557 - 1401			0
sign up for @entity122 's @entity162 volunteer teams to help spot and report oiled wildlife throughout the @entity83 at @entity164			0

rehabilitating oiled birds is a difficult and risky effort , says @entity167
@entity172 says birds may not survive the return to a natural *environment*
but saving birds can help ensure survival of endangered species , @entity167 says
people caused this problem ; many feel ethical duty to save as many birds as possible , he says
