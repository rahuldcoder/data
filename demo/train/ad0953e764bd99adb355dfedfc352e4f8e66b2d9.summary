-- the 30 - mile stretch between @entity2 and @entity3 , @entity4 , is still dotted with battle wounds from @entity6 seven years later			1
concrete slabs and steps that lead to nothing but trash and overgrown weeds are all that is left of historic brick homes			2
but amid the slabs are majestic homes with grand , sweeping porches and perfectly manicured lawns			2
the owners of these homes are as tough and resilient as only survivors of one of the deadliest storms in history could be			1
state - by - state : @entity26 evacuations , delays @entity29 resident @entity28 lives on the spot of his childhood home , set off the water where the bay feeds into the @entity34			1
while he and his family evacuated to safety inland , @entity6 's ravaging storm surge swept the house right off its stilts , leaving only the foundation intact			1
" we had some old columns that the old house stood on , and those columns were picked clean , there was nothing left on them , " he said			2
determined , @entity28 rebuilt where his boyhood home once stood , both stronger and higher			1
" i 've got poured concrete pillars filled with steel , 10 times more steel than before , " he said			2
" we 're now 24 feet above sea level , 11 feet from the ground			1
" @entity26 could bring in a 12 - foot storm surge , which would mean @entity28 's first floor could take on some water			1
" we do n't have anything important below that 24 - foot elevation , " he said			2
live blog : @entity26 moves in air conditioning units and electric boxes are strategically placed on the house 's second floor , safely away from most critical dangers			1
outside , the air is full of @entity26 's portents			1
the normally calming sounds of the surf are dimmed by hurricane flags clanging loudly against an old converted ship mast in @entity28 's front yard			2
the blazing red flags with the signature black squares in the center stand out in stark contrast to the temporarily blue sky			0
@entity28 and his neighbors are wary but calm			0
" i think everybody has come back in a much stronger fashion , " he said			0
" we 're watching , but we 're prepared			2
" riding eastward toward @entity80 along white sand beaches with sparkling blue waters , beautiful antebellum - style homes grace the coastline			0
the stately green manse where @entity86 and @entity87 live right off the beach is a new construction , a near replica of the 1800s - era house that was obliterated by @entity6			1
@entity92 : share your images , videos of @entity26 a portion of the second floor ended up in their neighbor 's yard			1
in the debris , the @entity101 found a closet that contained the original floorplans			0
armed with the diagram and hard lessons learned @entity108 , the family rebuilt			2
" we prepared for everything we think would happen in a redo of @entity6 , " @entity109 said			1
the house is made of walls a foot wide , windows that can withstand 200 mph winds , and sports steel beams that tunnel into the ground			0
" this is a special place for us			0
we like to get up in the morning , and first thing i do is look out to the @entity34			0
it gets angry from time to time , but it 's the most beautiful sight i see , " @entity109 said			0
" i was not going to live the rest of my life without coming back here			0
" the vacant lot next door is where @entity130 's mother used to live			0
6 mobile apps to track @entity26 " after @entity6 , she was like ' huh - uh , i 'm getting out of here , ' " @entity130 said			1
her mother , like herself , moved inland away from the @entity34 's reach			0
@entity130 and her husband spent some time on @entity80 's beach monday so their twin girls could enjoy some outdoor fun			0
" i told them it 's literally the calm before the storm , " she said			0
like many other @entity145 , @entity130 is ready for @entity26 , and other storms that may loom			1
" we are n't too worried			0
i do n't think it 'll be that bad , " she said			0
" but we know a @entity6 will happen again			1

@entity2 and @entity3 stretch still shows signs of @entity6
those who stayed have rebuilt with storms in mind
now they 're preparing for @entity26 and other *inevitable* storms
