open , expansive postures reflect and signal power ( picture @entity2 )			1
they are expressed by individuals who already feel powerful			1
powerless people do the opposite -- contracting , hunching , and making themselves smaller			2
when it comes to power , the mind shapes the body , a finding supported by extensive peer - reviewed science			2
this , to most of us , is not so surprising			0
but what is surprising , when it comes to power , is that the body also shapes the mind			2
@entity20 ( @entity21 ) and i , both experimental social psychologists , have conducted research showing that adopting these postures -- " power posing " -- actually causes people to become more powerful : after sitting or standing , alone in a room , in a high - power pose for just two minutes , participants in our experiments resembled powerful people -- emotionally , cognitively , behaviorally , and even physiologically			1
they felt more powerful , were more willing to take risks , presented their ideas with greater confidence and enthusiasm , performed better in demanding situations , and experienced significant increases in testosterone -- a hormone linked to assertiveness -- and significant decreases in cortisol -- a hormone linked to stress			2
in other words -- two minutes of preparatory power posing optimizes the brain to function well in high - stakes challenges			1
watch @entity52 's @entity51 when i launched this program of research , i was not motivated to turn @entity56 into @entity56 - on - steroids			1
but i can understand how , noticing that i 'm a professor at a competitive business school and that i use terms like " power " and " posing , " some people might have assumed that i was			1
in all honesty , my goal -- inspired in part by observing students who were struggling to engage in class discussions and in part by the feelings of powerlessness i 'd experienced earlier in my own life ( i.e. , yes , it was part " mesearch " ) -- was to discover scientifically grounded ways to help relatively powerless people harness some of the healthy psychological benefits that relatively powerful people often enjoy			1
i aspired to embolden the people suffering from what psychologists call " imposter syndrome " -- the experience of hearing that relentless , looping voice in your head that says , " i do n't deserve to be here , i do n't deserve to be here " -- which can be thoroughly disempowering			2
@entity51 : listening to shame i wanted to equip people with tools that would help them feel stronger and more confident , less stressed and fearful , and better able to bring their full , spirited selves to high - stakes , stressful situations -- like job interviews or speaking in class			1
preparatory power posing is taking a few minutes before walking into a stressful interaction or situation to open up , occupy more space , and make yourself big			1
stand with your feet apart and your hands on your hips , or with your arms reaching up in a ' @entity105 ' or sit with your legs in front of you , feet propped up on desk or a table , leaning back , with your hands on the back of your head , fingers interlaced , and elbows pointing out			2
try power poses in the elevator , a bathroom stall , the stairwell ... wherever you can find two minutes of privacy			1
who benefits from this , and how can those people use it in constructive ways ? in the month since my @entity51 was posted , i 've received messages from thousands of people around the world describing to me how they 've successfully used power posing to confront or overcome a challenge			1
i must admit , i never could have imagined the diverse range of contexts in which people are using it			0
i wish i had the space to tell you about all of them			0
let me at least offer a sample : people recovering from grave illnesses , injuries , and losses , unemployed people who have been job - hunting for months or years , young women struggling to get a foothold or to succeed in traditionally male - dominated professions , people trying to survive or leave abusive relationships , singers / actors / dancers preparing for auditions or performances , older adults and nontraditional students working up the courage to return to or to fully engage in their education , dedicated athletes training for highly competitive events , and teachers and parents of bullied children who -- every day -- have to confront their bullies			0
in short , i have heard from women and men , girls and boys , of all ages and races , and from nearly every corner of the world , who have encountered some kind of adversity , have been nagged by that voice telling them they do n't belong , and who have been searching for ways to successfully tackle their specific challenges and to prosper			0
@entity51 : embracing otherness as a researcher , i 'm moved beyond words by these strangers ' willingness to share such personal stories of vulnerability , and i 'm humbled and astounded to see how this research has resonated with people outside my science			0
one person wrote , " i learned that making progress in life is not a continuous function but rather a bunch of leaps of faith one needs to take in oneself			0
you need to do what you think is impossible and realize that people who already are doing that , are just like you			0
" another wrote , " i 'm a first generation student and senior at [ a large , top - tier university ] , but i still feel i do n't belong here			0
i was about to withdraw from school this week			0
your story inspired me to stay			0
you 'll never know how glad i am i found this video			0
" and this : " i am a shy person , and i had a job interview this morning			0
i got there early and i went to the washroom and raised my arms for 2 minutes			0
it was like magic how confident and outgoing i became during the interview			0
" what more could a social scientist ever hope for ? in short , the populations of people who can benefit from power posing extend far beyond business leaders and politicians			1
@entity51 : how to spot a liar the word " power " triggers a negative visceral twitch in many people			1
it 's a word that carries more than its fair share of baggage			0
but the kind of power i study -- intrapersonal power -- should not cause people to recoil , because it is neither zero - sum nor is it about interpersonal dominance			1
as @entity243 - winning author @entity242 once wrote , " @entity244 does n't always corrupt			0
what i believe is always true about power is that power always reveals			0
" power , ultimately , is not about faking or disguising ; it 's about revealing and bringing forth -- stripping away the fears and inhibitions that prevent people from being their truest , most energetic , vital selves			1
and , when people feel like their fullest selves -- they create , they connect , and they communicate			1
why would we not want a world full of people who feel that way ? so i ask you to do two things			2
first , try this : before you walk into a stressful situation or confront a difficult challenge , take two minutes to prepare by power posing in private			2
second , please , share this science with people who truly and chronically lack resources , status , and formal power ; this is a free , no - tech life hack that has the " power " to significantly change meaningful outcomes in their lives .			1

@entity52 : people who use expansive postures feel more powerful as a result
she says posing with your arms extended , taking up more space , affects your physiology
many who have tried " power poses " say it has helped them *navigate* life , she says
