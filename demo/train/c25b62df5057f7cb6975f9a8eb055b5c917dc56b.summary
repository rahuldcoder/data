-- even as she prays for her husband 's recovery , @entity1 wants to remind the world that there are thousands dying in @entity6 of the deadly ebola virus			1
dr. @entity8 is the latest @entity9 to become infected with the ebola virus while working in @entity10 for the aid organization @entity11			1
he was admitted to an ebola case management center over the weekend near the hospital in @entity14 where he has served for 15 years			0
" i am surrounded by friends and family and the body of @entity20 , who are a great encouragement and who are praying fervently for @entity8 's recovery along with me , " @entity1 said in a statement			1
" we are trusting in @entity26 to be with @entity8 and us through this difficult circumstance			1
" @entity8 would want me to urge you to remember that there are many people in @entity10 who are suffering in this epidemic and others who are not receiving standard health care because clinics and hospitals have been forced to close			1
@entity6 is on the verge of a humanitarian crisis , and the world needs to respond compassionately and generously			0
" @entity1 had been to @entity10 with @entity11 before , and volunteered to go again after he heard fellow missionaries @entity41 and dr. @entity43 had contracted the virus , @entity11 president @entity40 said			1
@entity41 spoke publicly for the first time about her ordeal at a news conference on wednesday			1
from @entity48 , @entity49 , she thanked @entity26 , her family , and health care workers in @entity10 and @entity52 for nursing her back to health			0
" i 'm so grateful that this beautiful woman is still with me , " her husband @entity54 said			2
" she is the best part of my life ... i love her with all my heart			1
" @entity43 : ' i felt like i was about to die ' @entity1 's story @entity1 , 51 , is from @entity61 , @entity62			2
he was not directly treating @entity64 patients in @entity10 during this trip , but was delivering babies at a general hospital in @entity14 , @entity40 said			1
the doctor started to show symptoms of haemorrhagic fever on friday evening			0
health care workers did an @entity64 test on monday , which came back positive for the deadly virus			1
@entity1 was following all protocols and taking all necessary precautions against @entity64 , @entity40 said			1
it is unclear how he became infected , but @entity11 is working with the @entity78 to determine the point of contact			0
when asked if the organization was going to bring @entity1 back to the @entity9 for treatment , @entity40 said all options were being explored			0
@entity84 is not likely to receive @entity85 , the experimental drug given to @entity41 and @entity43 , as there are no more doses available			1
but with supportive care , the doctor could very well recover			0
while @entity64 can be deadly in up to 90 % of cases , about half the people in this current outbreak have survived			1
" dr. @entity94 , dr. @entity1 's @entity10 colleague , has overseen the care and cure of many ebola virus disease patients in @entity10 , and i trust his expertise , " @entity1 said			1
@entity41 's story there were mornings in @entity10 , as @entity41 fought off the deadly ebola virus , when she woke up and thought with surprise , " i 'm alive			1
" @entity41 was diagnosed on july 25			1
she originally thought she had malaria , she said , and took medication to fight off the mosquito - borne disease			0
but even after the round of medication was completed , the symptoms persisted			0
a doctor took a blood sample for an ebola test " just to make sure " and it came back positive			0
when she found out , @entity41 told her husband it was going to be ok			1
but " i had no clue what was going to happen , " she said			0
@entity41 and @entity43 were flown from @entity10 to be treated at @entity118 in @entity52 in early august			1
as she was being boarded onto the plane , she thought , " i do n't even know if i 'm going to make it to the @entity9 " she said she remembers little else about the moments before the flight , other than a doctor in protective clothing putting his hands around her face and saying , " @entity41 , you 're going home			1
" at @entity118 , @entity41 was still in pain -- unable to move her legs or feet			2
but one day , she said , she pushed herself to get out of bed and take a shower			0
from that point on , doctors saw small signs of progress			0
@entity41 and @entity43 were released from the @entity52 hospital two weeks ago , just days apart			2
when asked what she thinks may have saved her -- the experimental drug ? the dedicated health care workers in @entity10 and @entity52 ? her faith ? -- @entity41 answered , " all of the above			2
" @entity41 , whose missionary work includes 14 years of aiding orphans and vulnerable children in @entity6 , was in @entity10 with the aid organization @entity11			2
she and her husband arrived there in august 2013			2
she guided missionaries and teams and worked with nurses at @entity151 in the capital of @entity14 , where her husband is the technical services manager , according to the @entity155 group 's website			2
the fact that the @entity157 left the comforts of @entity9 to live in an area rife with poverty , instability and disease , and put their lives at risk to assist those suffering everyday , does n't surprise those who know them			0
@entity168 , their friend and pastor at @entity170 in @entity48 , described the couple as " the @entity172 , " the kind of people who would n't give a second thought to dropping everything to help			0
the only thing perhaps ironic about what 's happening now is how such an " unassuming " and " very humble " woman has become international news			2
" she is ... not someone who would ever make the headlines , " @entity168 said , " apart from something like this			0
" married for 40 years , the @entity157 have traveled the globe , focused on their faith and their desire to help others			0
wherever they 've gone , their lives have been centered on their church and their family , including two now - adult sons who live in the @entity9			0
@entity64 might have derailed them , but it has n't changed their purpose in life			1
" we are n't going to stop our ministry , " @entity197 said last month			2
" we believe we can serve wherever @entity26 sends us			0
" for now , the couple is going to enjoy spending time with their children and grandchildren			0
@entity41 said she " ca n't wait " to put her arms around her family			2
@entity0 's @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this story .			0

dr. @entity8 's wife @entity210 says she is " praying fervently " for his recovery
@entity41 speaks for the first time publicly after surviving @entity64
" she is the best part of my life , " husband @entity197 says
