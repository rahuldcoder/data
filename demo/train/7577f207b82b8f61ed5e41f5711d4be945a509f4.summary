evangelical leaders are taking a step back from their decades - long fight against gay marriage , softening their tone and recalibrating their goals			1
in recent interviews with about a half - dozen prominent evangelicals , no one listed opposition to gay marriage as their top priority			1
the leaders said they 're more focused on protecting religious liberties as same - sex marriage becomes legal in a growing number of states			1
" is it time to differentiate between religious ceremony and civil ceremony ? " @entity20 , the president of @entity21 , said in an interview with @entity23			0
" civil ceremony to the @entity26 community is no different than getting your car registered			0
" the shifting attitude comes as the @entity30 could take up gay marriage as early as next year			1
meanwhile , republicans , who will take full control of @entity34 in january , are largely ignoring the issue -- just like most of the leading potential @entity32 contenders for the 2016 presidential nomination			1
" there is a recognition that while the fight should not be given up on upholding the several thousand - year - old definition of marriage , the courts are probably very quickly going to undo that , " said @entity38 , a conservative pundit and editor of @entity40			0
" behind the scenes , a lot of evangelical leaders inside and outside of politics are laying the groundwork for religious liberty and conscience protections			1
" implications for @entity32 the new stance could have big implications for republicans heading into the 2016 presidential election			2
evangelicals are an influential bloc of the party and if the community eases its opposition to same - sex marriage , that could make it easier for candidates to do the same			2
the party is under pressure to expand its appeal to young people and minorities and an openness to gay marriage could help that effort			1
@entity75 : @entity77 's campus challenge of course , there 's still plenty of opposition to same - sex marriage among @entity32			1
and the issue is a big fundraising motivator for the party and its allies			0
@entity86 , a 26 - year - old digital strategist who 's worked for evangelical favorites like @entity88 and @entity89 said social issues including gay marriage " remain very potent to the @entity32 electorate			1
" ' joke notion ' @entity94 , president of the @entity95 , dismissed talk of an evangelical shift as a " joke notion			0
" " people are still charged up about this , " @entity94 said			0
" there 's not been enough standing up for marriage especially in the wake of what is essentially a constitutional crisis			0
" @entity20 , whose daily @entity21 radio broadcast reach more than 2.9 million listeners weekly , is nowhere close to endorsing same - sex unions and insists that the legalization of gay marriage in the @entity111 is n't a " fait accompli			1
" but his vision for the evangelical movement is focused on reaching out to , rather than attacking or rejecting , other segments of society â€” what he calls taking a " gracious attitude			2
" he frequently mentioned his " friends in the gay rights community			0
" one of those friends is @entity121 , a prominent gay activist and @entity123 strategist			0
the two struck up an unlikely friendship after @entity20 reached out to @entity127 's office about two years ago to team up and fight child trafficking in their home state of @entity130			0
they see their bond as an example of where the dialogue is heading , through @entity127 said " people faint when they see us together			0
" ' common ground ' " with @entity20 , it 's a new day , " @entity121 said			0
" the reality of it is gays are n't going away and evangelicals are n't going away so we 're figuring out common ground			2
" @entity145 , the president of the @entity147 's @entity146 , is also advocating for a more open approach and has called for @entity26 to " love your gay and lesbian neighbors			0
" " if we do n't recognize ( the culture shift ) , we 're clueless as to what is happening , " @entity145 said in an interview			2
how @entity30 's non-decision helps gay marriage @entity157 , meanwhile , is an openly gay evangelical who recently published a book attempting to debunk @entity162 interpretations that define homosexuality as a sin			1
he went to a conference sponsored by @entity145 's group in october and was surprised that even his staunchest critics constructively interacted with him			0
he said he would have been " completely ignored " at the convention five years ago			0
" there 's definitely a coming divide between evangelicals , but it 's not public yet , " @entity157 said			0
" over the next year in particular , people will start to show their true colors			0
" generational divide about 43 % of white evangelical millennials support same - sex marriage , according to a 2014 @entity178 poll , while 7 in 10 white evangelicals overall oppose same - sex marriage			2
the generational split is even more pronounced among the @entity32 : nearly two - thirds of @entity32 under 30 favor same sex marriage compared to 39 % of all @entity32 , according to the @entity186 survey			1
@entity32 leaders are eyeing those polls closely and in the last two years , four @entity32 senators have announced their support for same - sex marriage			1
this year , the @entity32 fielded two openly gay @entity32 candidates for @entity34 -- though neither won			2
some , like @entity32 strategist and @entity194 activist @entity193 , say the party is changing too slowly and needs to put its opposition to gay marriage to rest			1
" i think the fact that the majority of @entity32 do n't support same sex marriage or @entity194 freedom is detrimental to reaching out and connecting to a new generation of voters , " said @entity199 , who is also a @entity23 political commentator			1
@entity199 runs the @entity206 , which spent more than $ 4 million in the 2014 cycle to support pro-gay marriage and lgbt rights @entity32 candidates , according to the group 's pre-election @entity212 filing			2
the @entity32 could see at least one pro-gay marriage presidential candidate in the 2016 elections if sen. @entity216 -- who has a gay son and endorsed same - sex marriage in 2013 -- decides to seek the party 's nomination			1
" when @entity222 was the nominee of the party , could you have imagined that there could be a @entity32 nominee the next time around who is in favor of same - sex marriage ? even i could n't have imagined that , " @entity199 said			1
