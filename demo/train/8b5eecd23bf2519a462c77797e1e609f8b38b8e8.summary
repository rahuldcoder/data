the combination is lethal and becoming all too familiar : a long criminal record , easy access to weapons , a loathing of the countries where they were born and deep - seated anti-semitism			2
so it was with the perpetrators of the @entity12 attacks			0
now , it appears to fit the description of the man who killed two people in @entity17 at the weekend			1
@entity17 police describe him as 22 years of age , born in @entity17 , with a violent past , connections with gangs and weapons offenses			1
@entity25 , head of the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , said investigators were " operating under a theory " the attack could have been inspired by last month 's attacks in @entity12 , which were also aimed at cartoonists			0
@entity32 , national security reporter at the @entity17 newspaper @entity33 , told @entity1 the gunman was on the radar of @entity17 police and @entity26 for gang - related activity but not extremism , according to his security sources			1
the gunman had recently spent time in jail for a knife attack			0
" there is a closer nexus between immigrant criminal gangs and violent extremists in @entity17 than anywhere else , " says @entity43 of the @entity44			1
" this interface makes violent extremists more dangerous as they are able to switch between roles and skill - sets and have easier access to illicit weapons on the underground market			0
" the so - called " @entity64 biker war " of the 1990s saw gang members in @entity17 and @entity58 attack each other with automatic weapons , grenades , and explosive devices			1
@entity65 , a former @entity17 jihadist , moved from being part of a biker gang to @entity68 extremism to spying for @entity71 intelligence			1
he says that belonging to gangs and extremist groups had made him feel he belonged to a " band of brothers			0
" in 2012 , a convicted drug trafficker and gang leader -- known as @entity77 -- traveled to @entity78 to take up arms against the @entity81 regime			1
his real name was @entity83			0
the subject of a tv documentary last year by @entity86 , @entity83 returned to @entity87 where he allegedly raised some $ 75,000 for the cause			2
he is now in prison after conviction on aggravated assault charges unrelated to terrorism			0
there is a long history of jihadist activism in @entity17 , and intelligence officials believe at least 110 @entity17 , both converts to @entity98 and @entity98 since birth , have traveled to @entity78 and @entity100			1
some estimates put the number as high as 200			0
at least 16 @entity17 have been killed in @entity78 and @entity100 , according to @entity26 , including 2 women			1
last year , @entity104 claimed several @entity17 suicide bombers had carried out attacks in @entity100 , including @entity107 , said to have carried out an attack in @entity110 province , and @entity111 , who detonated a car bomb close to an @entity100 military convoy near @entity114			2
it is believed as many as 70 @entity17 nationals have returned from @entity78 to @entity17			1
within @entity17 , according to @entity26 's latest assessment , there are " people who sympathize with militant @entity68 , but have not been in the conflict zone			2
" they may be " inspired by individuals or groups in the conflict zone or elsewhere abroad , " a danger heightened by @entity17 's participation in the international coalition against the @entity127 in @entity100 and @entity78 ( @entity104 )			1
recent postings on jihadist forums have singled out @entity17 as a target			1
one entitled " @entity131 , you who @entity134 , your turn has come , " and posted last month , urged " sons of @entity98 , in @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , and @entity17 " to " light fires beneath their feet			1
" " developments in the @entity145 in general , including in the @entity148 / @entity147 conflict , increase the threat of attack in the @entity151 against @entity148 or @entity153 targets , " @entity26 warned			0
a number of jihadist conspiracies in @entity17 have been foiled in recent years , but early in 2013 a man tried to shoot the writer @entity157 , a prominent critic of @entity98 , at his home in @entity87			1
@entity157 was not injured , but his assailant escaped on foot			0
among scores of @entity17 jihadists to have traveled overseas in recent years was @entity163 , who had spent time in prison for armed robbery in the 1990s			2
he eventually traveled to @entity100 where he joined @entity167			0
@entity168 took part in the beheading of the @entity138 @entity171 in 2004 before being killed fighting @entity138 forces in @entity173			0
much more recently , according to @entity176 , a group that tracks jihadist activity , a @entity17 national called @entity174 was killed in @entity178 , @entity100			1
he was not the first to make the journey			0
in august 2013 , a group of @entity17 in @entity78 released a video in which they fired at pictures of six @entity17 " kuffar attacking @entity98 " -- among them @entity183 , the @entity184 of @entity185 , @entity65 , and the cartoonist @entity186			1
@entity17 has been the focus of militants ' anger since the newspaper @entity33 published @entity186 's cartoon of the @entity192 in 2005			2
in an edition of its online magazine , @entity195 , @entity196 called for the murder of @entity186 -- as well as @entity198 , the editor of the paper when the cartoons were published , and @entity201 , the @entity58 cartoonist who was attending the free speech forum in @entity87 that was attacked at the weekend			0
@entity186 is under police protection in @entity17 after a conspiracy to murder him was uncovered in 2008 , and a 28 - year old @entity205 believed to have ties to @entity207 tried to kill him in 2010			2
in 2012 , three @entity58 nationals and a @entity210 resident of @entity58 were found guilty of targeting @entity33 in an @entity167 plot			2
prosecutors accused the four suspects of planning a gun attack on the newspaper , to be followed by " the execution " of hostages			0
they had been tracked from @entity58 and arrested in @entity87 in a joint operation between @entity58 and @entity17 intelligence			2
@entity17 has a large immigrant population from the @entity98 world -- including @entity147 , @entity222 , @entity205 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity210			1
while the vast majority have integrated peacefully , a small fraction of " second generation " immigrants -- as in @entity140 -- have adopted militant @entity229 , especially in @entity230 , @entity231 and parts of the capital			0
in 2010 , one counterterrorism expert , @entity234 , told @entity1 that out of @entity17 's population of some 18,000 @entity205 , there were at least 300 sympathizers of @entity207 , the jihadist group in @entity205 that is now an affiliate of @entity167			1
" those attracted are usually quite young -- there 's the usual issue of a clash of cultures , of being stuck between east @entity243 and @entity244 and not knowing where they belong , " @entity234 told @entity1			0
that clash of cultures threatens to shed more blood on the streets of @entity137 's major cities .			0
