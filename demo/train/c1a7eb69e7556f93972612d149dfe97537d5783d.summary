-- he revolutionized football once before by transforming its transfer system -- now @entity6 lawyer @entity5 is gunning to change the face of the game for a second time			1
in his sights is @entity12 's shiny new regulatory regime : @entity13 ( @entity14 ) , which has become the scourge of @entity12 's richest football clubs , notably @entity18 champion @entity16 and top @entity20 side @entity19 , which were both heavily sanctioned by @entity12 's governing body friday			1
@entity14 is designed to prevent clubs spending beyond their means and posting unsustainable yearly losses , but @entity5 believes the sanctions are " completely illegal " because they restrict competition -- a key principle of @entity29 law			1
" the break - even requirement , ' that 's in itself a pure violation of @entity29 competition law			1
any sanction that aims at enforcing an illegal rule is automatically illegal , " @entity5 told @entity0			2
in a statement sent to @entity0 , @entity12 said it " completely rejects " the suggestion that the break - even requirement may lead to any restriction of competition in the market for matches played in @entity12 club tournaments			2
" @entity14 rules emerged from a wide - reaching consultative process involving all relevant stakeholders in @entity49 football , " read a statement from @entity12			1
" as such , there is no doubt that the rules have democratic legitimacy since they were the product of an inclusive and democratic process			0
" the substantive content of the rules -- especially the break - even principle , based on the idea that you ' do n't spend more than you earn ' -- is just economic common sense and a sensible prudential rule			0
" @entity14 sounds good , " added @entity5			2
" who would n't support good governance and fairness of the game ? " but when you scratch the surface , the break - even rule is no more than a prohibition to invest			0
" @entity5 believes @entity14 raises further competition concerns by entrenching the status quo , by not allowing clubs like @entity16 and @entity19 to challenge the established football order in future			1
" @entity12 prohibits the owner of a club to spend his own money in the club , at least to buy players , in order to make it grow and to challenge the established top dogs			0
" today , with this rule , @entity81 could not build his @entity84 project and turn it into one of @entity12 's top clubs			1
" in other words , the rule ossifies the market structure			0
the few top @entity49 clubs will remain the same forever -- there will be no new kid in town			0
" to back up his argument , @entity94 cites an academic article by professor @entity98 on @entity29 competition law and @entity14			1
" @entity98 says @entity14 creates what he calls a ' @entity101 : the break - even rule destroys competitive balance -- the big clubs will be bigger ; the small clubs , smaller ; and no small club will ever again become a big one , " said @entity5			1
again @entity12 rejects the accusations			0
it says " @entity14 enhances competition through improving managerial incentives in football "			2
it adds that " clubs are encouraged to invest in training and infrastructure rather than ' payroll - gambling ' "			0
threat of expulsion last week , @entity16 was hit with an $ 82 million fine and squad restrictions for next season 's @entity120 , while @entity19 also received a heavy financial punishment			0
@entity5 argues clubs wo n't risk taking @entity12 on in the courts because it might lead to their expulsion from the @entity120 or the @entity126 and disrupt their transfer activities			2
additionally , they have the feeling that the political cost would be high , said the @entity6 lawyer			1
it 's a threat that has ensured @entity12 has faced little opposition over @entity14			1
" pay me â ‚ ¬ 60 million or i will expel you from competitions , which will cause you an even bigger damage , " said @entity5			0
" this is clearly a threat of expulsion			0
again , a major crime under @entity49 competition law			2
and even more so since this threat aims at enforcing a rule that , itself , violates competition law			2
" @entity94 also argues part of the punishment handed out to @entity16 -- where its squad for next season 's @entity120 has been reduced from 25 players to 21 with at least eight of those having to be home grown -- is also " illegal			0
" @entity12 's homegrown players rule requires at least eight players in a @entity49 squad to have been trained domestically for three years between the ages of 15 and 21 -- a rule which @entity5 says is open to challenge			1
" the whole @entity12 home grown player system violates @entity159 , " said the @entity6 lawyer who is based in @entity157			1
" this rule violates free movement of workers and harms free competition without any solid justification			0
" in other words , if any club or player challenges this rule tomorrow in court , the judge -- based on @entity29 law -- will have no choice but to declare this @entity12 rule null and void			1
" intriguingly , @entity5 urged the supporters of the nine clubs sanctioned by @entity12 to become involved in the battle against @entity14			1
" million and millions of people could challenge @entity14 tomorrow , " said @entity5 , who is already contesting the @entity14 regulations through the courts in a case he is fighting on behalf of football agent @entity181			2
" the fans can do this through their associations			0
they are the consumers of the football product and the ultimate aim of competition law is to protect the consumers			2
" they are free to join the complaint lodged by my client , player agent @entity181 , with the @entity193 and the civil action he has launched in the @entity196 court			0
" they could even ask the @entity196 judge to stay the execution of the @entity14 regulation -- and of the sanctions based on it - until he renders his judgment on the merits			1
" since the break - even rule will stop for ever the vast majority of clubs from challenging the existing top @entity49 clubs , the fans of these ' underdog ' clubs have a legitimate interest and can ask the judge to declare the break - even rule null and void			0
" and the same goes for ( for instance ) the sponsors of all these clubs			0
" it was nearly 20 years ago that @entity5 , who helped @entity6 footballer @entity219 change @entity49 law in 1995 to allow players to move for free at the end of their contract			1
whether it change @entity49 law for a second time remains to be seen .			0
