-- soon you wo n't have to worry about your phone falling in the toilet , tumbling into a puddle or someone inadvertently dribbling coffee into the headphone socket ( we 've all done it )			0
@entity10 - based firm @entity9 has developed a " liquid repellent nano - coating " technology -- branded @entity12 -- that can be sprayed onto a solid surface and , they claim , repel nearly all forms of liquid			1
the polymer coating in question is a patented chemical that lowers an object 's surface energy , causing liquid to form beads upon contact and roll off without being absorbed			1
the chemical itself is a little less than 50 nanometers wide -- that 's 1,000 times thinner than a human hair and , suffice to say , completely invisible to the naked eye			2
that means once a mobile phone -- or any electronic device -- has been coated , it 's still physically indistinguishable from the original			2
" you look at it and you ca n't see any change , " explains @entity33 , the chemical engineer who developed the technology			1
" but when you drop water on it , it will just bead up and drop off			0
more importantly , the internals will also be protected to prevent corrosion damage			0
" like the @entity46 , gps and digital photography before it , @entity12 began life as a military - sponsored innovation -- with a military purpose in mind			0
in this case , the @entity10 @entity51 were seeking to provide maximum protection to its soldiers ' uniforms so they could resist all types of liquid assailants , " not just rainwater , but also chemical nasties like nerve agent , " says @entity33			1
" we did about a year 's research and then found the technology -- which was the eureka moment where we put certain drops of liquid onto fabrics and , rather than being absorbed into it , they rolled off , " he added			1
indeed , the research was so successful that the scale by which liquid repulsion is measured immediately required updating , claims @entity33			1
" before we started this research the top end was what was called ' oil 8 ' ... we 've now had to push that up to ' @entity77 ' in order to fully measure all of the treatments we 've made ... we 're seeing resistance that people have never seen before " it 's a gratifying result for a man who has invested every minute of his professional life perfecting the technology			2
the first shoots of what would later become known as @entity12 sprouted in @entity33 's research as a phd student in the 1990s			1
the patents were established at the turn of the millennium , but it was n't until the beginning of 2011 that the technology finally made its way into the kit of @entity10 's @entity98			1
now having demonstrated that @entity99 can repel almost any type of liquid from almost any type of solid surface and also act , incidentally , as an anti-microbial and flame retardant , you 'd assume a host of industry reps would be knocking down the door 's to @entity9 head office in @entity111			2
but @entity33 says it 's not been quite so straightforward			1
" i think any new technology is a hard sell to start with			0
you can show the benefits and it 's very visual , so that gets you a seat at the table to discuss it , but when you 're talking about implementing new manufacturing solutions and technology into mass - manufacturing then you have to convince a lot of people , " says @entity33			1
" you 've got to not only engage with the technical people , the marketing but also the operational and implementation people , " he adds			0
having said that , the numbers are starting to tell a different story			0
@entity9 has worked closely with @entity132 , who have now implemented the technology in 10 million of their latest phones and the polymer is also coating about 60 % of the world 's hearing aids			1
meanwhile , the company has installed over 100 nano - coating machines within major manufacturing centers around the world and turnover has been doubling every year -- last year hitting $ 20 million			1
" we 're also working with all of the top ten mobile phone manufacturers			0
we 've just recently signed @entity147 and we have a number of announcements moving forward , " says @entity33			2
but mobiles and other electronic goods most obviously vulnerable to liquid corrosion are just the tip of the iceberg as far as @entity33 is concerned			2
following the success of its clothes range with the @entity158 , civilian varieties from your favorite brands will soon be in store			0
@entity9 already has deals with shoe - makers @entity164 , @entity166 and @entity167			0
@entity33 argues that there 's a fundamental difference between existing waterproof clothes and garments coated with ion - mask ™ ( effectively the same as @entity12 but specially tailored for the fabrics market )			1
" a waterproof jacket in the rain without our technology will provide protection against water coming through it directly -- however the outside material will get wet and start to increase in weight , he explains			2
" it may also get dirty ; you may get staining on there			0
with the ion - mask ™ technology on the outside of that jacket ... it remains the same weight			0
" indeed , anything that suffers reduced performance from the effects of liquid intrusion seems to be in @entity33 's sights : @entity9 have even experimented with things like tennis balls , surfboards and the nose cones of @entity201 racing cars			1
" we see the future as everything being treated with @entity9 's technology , " he says			0
only time will tell if it 's as watertight a proposition as it sounds .			0

liquid repellent nano - coating technology prevents water from being absorbed onto surfaces
most *popular* application so far is within mobile phones and hearing aids
the chemical 's @entity10 - based inventor @entity33 says it could be applied to almost everything
