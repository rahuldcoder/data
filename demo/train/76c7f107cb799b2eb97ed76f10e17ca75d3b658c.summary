-- @entity2 's greatest golfer tried time and time again to conquer the @entity4 , and failed			1
but where @entity5 fell short , @entity7 succeeded , becoming the first @entity2 to ever get his hands on the feted trophy			1
@entity7 has already made it to world number one , bagged his first major at the @entity13 and sunk the winning putt in a @entity15 before he is 30			2
@entity5 did win the masters twice in his illustrious career but now his successor has two of the four major titles in his back pocket after an emphatic win at @entity23			1
new heart , new hope for @entity26 @entity7 laid the foundations for victory by recording the lowest score over two rounds in the tournament 's history and duly kept his nearest challengers at arm 's length to win by an incredible eight shots			1
@entity26 , who had two heart transplants before joining the @entity38 , finished in a tie for second with fellow @entity42 @entity41			1
" we have almost a @entity2 grand slam -- only the @entity45 is missing , " @entity7 said after finishing on nine under			1
" to win the masters is a huge thing and obviously that 's why i need to adjust a few things in my swing in order to play better golf there			2
" winning the @entity42 @entity38 and winning this one now i hope it will make @entity5 proud and all of @entity2 proud			1
" overall it was a very nice week , a very nice day			0
credit to the fans because it was very fair to play			0
" i did n't make many mistakes in the last two wins i had in @entity42 , especially this week			2
i played very solid the first two days and that gave me a very nice cushion for the weekend			0
" i was very happy with the way i kept it together yesterday and that gave me a cushion for today			0
" @entity7 never looked like relinquishing the five - shot lead he held going into the final day and was one of only a clutch of players who posted under par rounds			2
two birdies and two bogeys in the opening 10 holes consolidated his position before back - to - back birdies on 13 and 14 edged him further ahead			0
with a challenge from @entity41 or @entity77 failing to materialize , the @entity2 could enjoy the closing holes knowing the title was his and he rolled in a par putt on the final green to seal the deal			1
it marks an incredible return to the top of the game for a man who drifted down to 63rd in the rankings after a slump in form			0
but after a stellar start to the season , @entity7 has become the first man to win both the @entity94 , regarded as the unofficial fifth major , and the @entity4 in the same season			1
@entity26 meanwhile has had a very different journey to the top table in golf after undergoing two heart transplants the 34 - year - old was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy at the age of nine , a condition that limits the heart 's capacity to pump blood , and had his first transplant three years later			1
he had another just as his career was taking and has battled to secure a berth on the tour , his second place at @entity23 his biggest achievement in the sport to date			2
" it felt like a sacred place this week , " @entity26 said on @entity114			2
" i 'm speechless , really			0
the support i got gave me goosebumps from tee to green			0
" it 's a real special moment			0
i 've never got this far along in my story and it has n't really sunken in yet			0
" i was playing for second , i think we all were playing for second			0
i hit the ball really well from tee to green			0
" i did n't know i 've got into the masters so this is just a career - opening thing for me , for me to be able to put myself on the map and prove i 'm not just a guy with two heart transplants			1
