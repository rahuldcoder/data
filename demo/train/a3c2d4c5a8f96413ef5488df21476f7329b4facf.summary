-- the guns of august 1914 unleashed a debate that is still with us : can the laws of war actually impose limits on how war is carried out ? @entity8 invaded @entity9 , violating that nation 's neutrality -- which was guaranteed by treaties stretching back to the 19th century			1
this act horrified the world -- as would the civilian occupation policies that marked @entity8 rule in @entity9 , @entity17 , and elsewhere during the long years of trench warfare			0
the question of how much international law should be respected during wartime has resurfaced repeatedly through the 20th century -- in @entity23 , it has come up frequently since 9/11 , especially surrounding the " torture debate			1
" indeed the revelations that @entity23 soldiers in @entity27 brutalized detainees at @entity30 prison marked a turning point in how @entity23 regarded the morality of " our " war , and on one level this was nothing new : atrocity has repeatedly stunned @entity23 throughout their history , and they have sometimes mobilized against it			1
opinion : how a century - old war affects you yet on another level , the years since @entity30 have marked a radical new stage , because of how central law has been to our debates about war : the @entity23 government tried to deny that treaties prohibiting torture ( from the 1949 @entity50 onward ) applied to the global war on terror , but it failed			1
in fact , over the 20th century , the world took real strides towards the goal of " humanizing war , " though perhaps only because the century also made war itself so much worse			0
but there is another story about @entity61 and the legal consequences it set off that is less familiar and more disquieting			1
it is about a legacy we have lost , rather than one we have realized : that of aiming , through the laws of war , to bring war itself to an end			1
opinion : should nations pay the price for their leaders ' misdeeds ? @entity61 , as @entity78 famously argued , discredited what @entity79 in a classic poem called " the old lie " : that it is sweet and honorable to die for one 's country			1
but what it has meant to shift allegiances from nation to " humanity " has changed drastically over the 20th century among those flirting with wider and cosmopolitan sensibilities			0
namely , the highest goal shifted from the abolition to the humanization of war			2
when @entity61 ended , the @entity8 @entity97 was very nearly criminally tried			2
it was only his flight to the @entity99 that made him inaccessible to justice			0
but it was his aggression , rather than his army 's atrocity , that mattered most			2
there is even evidence that after @entity61 the phrase " crimes against humanity " -- which now refers to abuses against civilians -- often meant warmongering itself			2
opinion : the mighty women of @entity61 in other words , the law would criminalize war , rather than merely make it cleaner			1
the @entity119 after @entity120 maintained this focus , attending most to the @entity123 ' aggressive crimes against peace -- bringing war to the world like the @entity97 had before them -- than atrocities in general or crimes against humanity in particular			2
by contrast , our post- 9/11 debates around the laws of war have rarely centered on the moral validity or legal propriety of war itself			1
rather , from the torture revealed at @entity30 , to drones , and now surveillance , the concern of the mainstream of the @entity23 public has centered on how far the executive may go in the pursuit of victory			0
if law matters , it is to keep the war " humane , " rather than to keep it from happening in the first place			2
opinion : how @entity61 gave us ' cooties ' many survivors of @entity61 would have viewed this as a drastic constriction of their aspirations and a failure of their aims			2
even if it is justifiable , the narrowing of our concerns must be explained			0
for @entity23 , it may have been @entity165 that caused the transformation			2
that era saw a massive spike in antiwar consciousness , and @entity23 joined the world in worrying that the country was now forsaking the very legacy of the laws of war it had helped build			2
but after that generation 's @entity30 -- the @entity184 , whose revelation in army photographer @entity182 's images was once equally famous -- a consensus slowly built			0
what people arguing about war could agree on was that it was immoral and illegal to fight it so brutally			0
the goal of criminalizing aggression lost traction , and focus on atrocity took its place			1
opinion : the ' bionic men ' of @entity61 in the years after @entity165 , more and more people signed on to this view			1
@entity200 shows it was after and in response to @entity165 that @entity23 joined the international human rights movement , which sponsored a campaign against @entity205 , which in turn led to a treaty outlawing the practice , setting up the possibility for our torture debate			1
many of the statutes that most constrain the executive in the way it fights , such as the @entity217 , were passed in this atmosphere			0
( @entity219 also passed laws trying to keep presidents from unilateral military action , especially the @entity223 , but recent history shows it to be a dead letter			0
) i find the @entity165 - era debate to be an illuminating point of comparison with our time			1
if we are honest , we will see that atrocities after @entity23 's 1965 escalation in @entity165 then dwarfed atrocities now			0
it hardly makes whatever violations we have committed excusable , of course , to say so			0
how @entity61 gave us drones the other day , president @entity240 acknowledged that " the @entity241 tortured some folks " after 9/11 , but the full documentation has remained a political football and neither @entity245 nor @entity246 want accountability for crimes			1
but we should not let our justified outrage over these facts distract from the truth that @entity23 's post- 9/11 military has fought some of the cleanest wars ever			0
in particular , compared with the crimes of prisoner detention and aerial targeting in @entity165 ( and torture too ) , @entity23 's recent misdeeds have been minor			0
one big reason is the @entity23 military 's own response to @entity165 : after decades of benign neglect or outright disregard , it started to treat the laws of war as real constraints on how it fights			1
opinion : when chemical weapons killed 90,000 consider the decision to target enemies to make sure only combatants rather than civilians are in our crosshairs : @entity165 was more like @entity61 , with lawyers nowhere to be found , and civilians dying in massive numbers			1
today military and other government lawyers play a central role , as the recent controversy over the legal authorization of the drone strike on @entity287 attests			0
the long trajectory from @entity61 has produced a paradoxical situation : we now have real , though insufficient , constraints on war 's brutality , and more public discourse than ever about it			1
but we lack much concern about the goal of eliminating war itself			0
one legacy of the horrified response to modern war remains alive and well , but the other is forgotten			0
the " war to end all wars , " as @entity61 has long been known , does n't deserve that name yet			1

@entity310 : @entity61 launched debate : can laws of war impose limits how war carried out ?
after @entity61 , aim was to end war , but in 100 years , aim shifted to making it more ' humane , ' he says
@entity310 : focus now not to end nations ' aggression , but to stop atrocity . @entity165 a low point
since 9/11 , our wars much cleaner , lawful ; but @entity61 idea of ' war to end wars ' failed , he says
