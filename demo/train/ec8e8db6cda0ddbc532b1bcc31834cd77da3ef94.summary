" now , @entity1 hopes to help others by sharing how she survived an unimaginable betrayal			1
in 2007 , @entity1 's then - husband , @entity12 , was convicted of attempted aggravated sexual battery against a minor			1
@entity1 says she was in a public place when she first learned of @entity12 's arrest			1

" this story is so deep and wide			2
there 's more to it than i can tell you , " she says			2

" @entity0 : watch @entity1 discuss healing her family @entity1 says she was determined to become better , not bitter , after her divorce			1
" when i got really alone , my life coach said : ' you 'll think you 're going to die from crying of a broken heart			2
and if you 'll let yourself lean into the pain , you 'll wake up one day and you 'll stop crying and you 'll move forward , ' " she says			2
" i just had to have faith and believe in someone else because i did n't believe in myself			2
" @entity1 says @entity12 struggled with addiction , and her family had to learn to heal from that			1
" that saved me , making sure that my children , that we , could break the cycle of addiction , " she says			2
we are not our diseases			2

and i just started walking in the wilderness and screaming at @entity133 , ' why ? ' " she says			0
" i just kept walking , and next thing i know , i like to walk			0
so i call it meditative walking versus ' i 've - got - to - be - in - the - @entity138 ' or ' get - back - to - my - original - weight - of - 8 - pounds - 15 - ounces ' [ walking ]			0
" as a result , @entity1 's loving her spirit and her body			1

i could eat you up alive			0
' " @entity1 says she 's finally putting herself first			1
