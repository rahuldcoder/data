-- if the @entity5 begins saturday , as an apocalyptic christian radio network has predicted , the community of @entity2 , @entity3 , will likely take it in stride			1
perhaps that 's because the souls who lived in 15 to 20 homes in the southwest corner of the state are long gone -- leaving only one family and the name rapture on online maps			1
curious about its history , @entity0 called area post offices , the town hall in nearby @entity20 and the local library			2
nobody had heard of @entity2 , much less knew how it got its name			1
but they did know of @entity26 , as the tiny community on @entity28 is now known			2
@entity29 , director of @entity30 , did a little digging and suggested a call to @entity26 's sole resident , who splits his time between @entity3 and @entity35			1
@entity36 gave up his law practice and moved to @entity35 , where he plays upright bass and sings in groups @entity40 and @entity41			2
he owns a home , rental property and an airplane hangar in @entity26			0
" the rest is grass , " said @entity36			0
an atheist , @entity36 is not fretting about @entity50 founder @entity49 's prediction that @entity51 will return during the world 's destruction and ascend into heaven with true believers			1
i 'm not concerned if the world does n't end and it 's all a hoax , " @entity36 said from @entity35 friday			1
" if it does ( end ) , i 've had a great time living to 46			0
" in nearby @entity63 , @entity62 , 77 , said he is familiar with @entity26			0
" it 's a dot in the road			2
" he , too , was philosophical about saturday 's predicted rapture			1
" i think the @entity68 says you never know when it will happen			0
" @entity36 , whose @entity3 home is 150 years old , said old - timers at some point began referring to @entity2 as @entity26			1
" we 'll never know exactly where the name came from , " he said of @entity2			1
he does have a idea on why the area is called @entity26			0
" she said there was a lot of bugs , " the musician said , quoting his grandmother			0
for several years , @entity36 has held the @entity83 the sunday before @entity84			0
bluegrass and other musicians play			0
the event has included a square dance , two parachutists and a helicopter			0
all for a $ 10 donation			0
@entity36 's not sure if he 'll pull it together this year			2
" it 's a lot of beer bottles to pick up			2
" saturday , meanwhile , should be pretty quiet in the @entity3 farm country , with highs in the low 80s , but scattered thunderstorms in @entity20 are possible			1
the @entity20 library is planning to open at 9 a.m. come rain or @entity2 , postal carriers will deliver mail , said postmaster @entity103 in nearby @entity104			1
" absolutely , " she said .			0

@entity2 , @entity3 , is in farm country a half - hour *northwest* of @entity107
it 's not clear how it got its name
a radio network has predicted that @entity5 will begin saturday
