@entity0 -- @entity2 , formerly the finance chief at @entity4 's investment advisory business , pleaded guilty in federal court in @entity6 on tuesday to 10 charges including securities fraud and international money laundering			1
@entity2 , center in this courtroom sketch , said he knew for about 20 years he was engaged in wrongdoing			2
the charges carry a maximum sentence of 125 years			0
with his guilty plea , @entity2 waived his right to a trial			2
as tuesday 's hearing commenced , @entity19 district judge @entity18 explained that for him to accept @entity2 's guilty plea , @entity2 would have to sufficiently convince him that he was , in fact , guilty			1
that set the stage for a dramatic statement from @entity2 about his history at @entity4 's firm , his personal relationship with @entity4 , and the mechanics of a multibillion - dollar ponzi scheme for which @entity4 was convicted in june			1
while @entity2 's guilty plea and the judge 's acceptance of it were expected , both the defense and the prosecution were surprised by the judge 's decision to reject @entity2 's bail agreement -- and to have him escorted from the courtroom in handcuffs			1
the defense and even the prosecution pleaded with the judge not to order @entity2 into custody			2
prosecutors told the judge they believed remanding @entity2 would impede the " efficiency " of their @entity4 investigation			1
@entity48 , the lead defense attorney , stood multiple times to dispute the decision , variously suggesting to the judge that @entity2 instead be put under house detention , that he wear an electronic monitoring device , and that the decision on his bail agreement be postponed for 48 to 72 hours			1
he added that @entity2 's family was " completely unprepared " for this outcome			2
while @entity18 patiently heard out @entity48 's many counterproposals , he refused to back down from his decision , asserting that @entity2 was too serious a flight risk given the " astronomical " maximum sentence he may receive			2
the judge also said that he could not " overlook the conduct [ @entity64 ] admitted to " despite @entity2 's avowed determination to do the right thing henceforth			1
though @entity2 remained outwardly calm for much of tuesday 's proceedings , the judge 's decision not to grant him bail appeared to stun him			1
he seemed in a daze as it became clear he would leave the courtroom in handcuffs , cupping his head in his hands and rubbing his temples			0
earlier in his testimony , @entity2 recounted how he joined @entity4 's company as a newly minted high - school grad in 1975			1
he held numerous jobs during his 33 - year tenure -- options trader and research analyst among them -- but above all he was a " guy who did whatever he was told to do around the office			0
" working side by side with @entity4 for decades , @entity2 developed a tight bond with his employer			2
" @entity93 was a mentor to me and more , " he said , adding that he was " loyal to a terrible , terrible fault			0
" his sense of loyalty led him to falsify documents for his boss for years on end , he said			0
using a financial program , he looked up historical prices of stocks and then drafted customer statements showing bogus stock transactions			2
he calculated theoretical commissions that the business should have received from the trades that it did not actually make , and then wired money from account to account to make those commissions appear , he said			0
and as a principal point of contact for investors in @entity4 's investment advisory business , @entity2 said , he also regularly fielded calls from investors curious about how their money was being managed , knowing that the trades he told them about were entirely fictitious			1
he said he had been aware that what he was doing was wrong since the " late ' 80s , early ' 90s			0
" " i do n't know how i went from an 18 - year - old kid who happened to have a job [ to ] standing in front of you today , " he said			0
@entity2 repeatedly stated that he perpetrated the massive fraud in collusion " with others , " though he specified neither who those other were nor how many they numbered			2
@entity2 said he rationalized to himself that @entity4 's victims would have a soft landing if the @entity134 ever came crumbling down			1
he said he thought @entity4 had assets he could liquefy in a worst - case scenario			0
" i know my apology means nothing , " @entity2 said			0
his voice quavered as he expressed remorse for his part in swindling charities that had invested with @entity4			0
@entity143 , a @entity4 victim who said she lost 40 years ' worth of personal savings in the scheme and was now on the brink of homelessness , asked the judge to reject @entity2 's guilty plea			1
she insisted that the " full truth " would come out only if @entity2 stood trial			0
both legal teams said they expected sentencing to happen in may			0
each side will have the opportunity to submit documents and testimonies in support of or against @entity2 before @entity18 hands down the sentence			0
@entity2 is the second person involved in the @entity4 scheme to land behind bars as a result of the fraud			1
in june , @entity4 pleaded guilty to 11 counts and was sentenced to 150 years in prison for masterminding the scheme			1
prosecutors have said it was the largest investor fraud committed by a single person , totaling billions in losses to investors .			0
