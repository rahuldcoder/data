-- gradual hearing loss is a common symptom of aging , but in some people it may also be an early sign of alzheimer 's disease or other types of dementia , a new study suggests			1
the risk of dementia appears to rise as hearing declines			2
older people with mild hearing impairment -- those who have difficulty following a conversation in a crowded restaurant , say -- were nearly twice as likely as those with normal hearing to develop dementia , the study found			2
severe hearing loss nearly quintupled the risk of dementia			1
@entity0 : 25 signs and symptoms of @entity24 it 's unclear why the loss of hearing and mental function might go hand in hand			2
brain abnormalities may contribute independently to both conditions , but it 's also possible that hearing problems can help bring on dementia , the researchers say			2
hearing loss may lead to social isolation ( which itself has been linked to dementia ) , for instance , or it may interfere with the brain 's division of labor			1
" the brain might have to reallocate resources to help with hearing at the expense of cognition , " says the lead researcher , @entity44 , @entity45 , an ear surgeon at @entity46 in @entity47			0
that may explain in part why straining to hear conversations over background noise in a loud restaurant can be mentally exhausting for anyone , hard of hearing or not , he adds			2
the findings suggest that poor hearing is a " harbinger of impending dementia , " says @entity64 , @entity45 , a hearing expert at the @entity65 in @entity66 , who was not involved in the new study but whose own research has demonstrated a link between the two conditions			0
" we listen with our ears but hear with our brains , " @entity64 says			1
" it is simply not possible to separate audition and cognition			0
" @entity0 : 9 foods that may help save your memory in the study , which appears in the @entity81 , @entity44 and his colleagues followed more than 600 dementia - free adults between the ages of 36 and 90 for an average of 12 years			0
a little less than 30 percent of the study participants had some hearing loss at the start of the study			1
overall , 9 percent of the participants went on to develop alzheimer 's disease or another form of dementia			0
mild , moderate , and severe hearing loss were associated with a two-fold , three-fold , and five-fold higher risk of later dementia , respectively , in comparison to normal hearing			1
people with moderate hearing loss generally struggle to communicate even in quiet settings , and those with severe hearing loss are near deaf			1
@entity44 says that hearing loss has an enormous impact on the lives of his patients and their family members			1
" yet because it is such a slow and insidious process , it is often left ignored and untreated			0
" whether hearing aids or other treatments ( such as cochlear implants ) can help stave off dementia is the " 50 billion dollar question , " @entity44 adds			0
thirty million @entity116 currently have impaired hearing and 1 in 30 are predicted to suffer from dementia by 2050 , so if those treatments prove to be helpful , their impact would be felt widely			1
@entity0 : aging workforce means dementia on the job could rise there is no cure for dementia , and there are no surefire ways of preventing it			0
@entity64 is n't optimistic that restoring hearing can affect the course of dementia			0
however , if treatments and prevention strategies for dementia do become available in the future , he says , hearing loss could play an important role in early detection			1
@entity44 and his colleagues have begun researching the effect of hearing aids on the risk of dementia			0
" whether or not it can help dementia , we do n't know yet , " he says			0
" but in the meantime , there 's no reason not to take your hearing loss seriously and pursue some type of treatment			2

in some people , gradual hearing loss may also be an early sign of types of dementia
" we listen with our ears but hear with our brains , " a source says
30 million @entity116 have impaired hearing ; dementia predicted for 1 in 30 by 2050
