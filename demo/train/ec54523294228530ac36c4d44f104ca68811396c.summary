@entity0 , @entity1 -- an aggressive public relations offensive by the @entity4 , celebrating the anniversary of @entity7 's death , is kicking up a hot political fuss			1
but are we arguing over the wrong question ? with their eyes clearly locked on the november elections , president @entity11 and his team are going all out to dramatize his decision - making and success in taking out @entity18			1
what they 're doing : opening up the @entity4 situation room for a presidential interview with @entity23 , running a television ad by former president @entity25 , feeding stories to authors and journalists , encouraging surrogate attacks on @entity31 's courage , even a catchy campaign slogan from @entity33 -- " @entity7 is dead and @entity34 is alive			1
" in mock innocence , the @entity4 says they are only responding to news media requests			0
is this @entity4 exploitation for political purposes indecorous and unbecoming , as @entity39 claim ? of course it is			1
another view : why @entity11 owns @entity7 president @entity42 set the standard for exemplary conduct when he refused to dance on the @entity46 grave after its empire collapsed and directed credit toward the @entity50 military when they chased @entity52 dictator @entity51 out of @entity53			1
but more often than not , a president looking toward re-election has gone too far the other way , milking foreign adventures for votes and @entity39 have been as guilty as @entity59			2
one of my vivid memories from early @entity4 days was the way we choreographed @entity64 's visit to @entity65 in 1972 , and especially his triumphant return , so that his helicopter from @entity68 landed on the @entity70 lawn and he then strode into the @entity4 chamber to report to a joint session of @entity73			0
it was boffo television , and he won re-election in a landslide not long after			0
or think of that " @entity81 " performance by president @entity80 in 2003 as he landed on an aircraft carrier , stepped out in a flight jacket , and spoke to a prime time audience about @entity52 -- with that " @entity88 " banner just behind him			0
even in my wildest dreams in the @entity4 , i never dreamed of using an aircraft carrier as a prop			0
not long after , @entity42 , too , won re-election			0
( it was not lost on the son that dad 's approach had n't won over voters for re-election			0
) so even though @entity11 's critics have a valid point about his current pr offensive , they should n't beat him up			1
the public is a good judge of when a president and his team overplay their hands			2
indeed , it would be far better for @entity39 to acknowledge that the president , his advisers and especially the @entity110 and the @entity111 handled @entity7 superbly			1
this was a moment that richly deserves public praise			0
if they would acknowledge that achievement , his critics would then have the credibility to raise the more important and serious question : whether the killing of @entity7 and the gradual crushing of @entity122 as a serious threat to the @entity50 has been as transformative as the @entity4 would lead us to believe			2
no one at @entity4 is hanging up " @entity88 " banners , but with elections a half year away , the @entity4 wants us to know that we have a warrior commander in chief at the helm nailing our enemies			0
unfortunately , it is n't that simple			0
serious observers are arguing that in the aftermath of @entity7 's death , the world may actually have become more dangerous			1
in sunday 's @entity137 , columnist @entity136 persuasively makes the case that we got our man but , as @entity7 hoped , other militant islamists are now gaining political strength in key countries such as @entity144 and @entity145			1
in an excellent essay in @entity149 on @entity7 's elimination , @entity147 scholar @entity146 argues that as we now focus on @entity152 producing its first bomb in the coming 12 months , an increasingly unreliable @entity151 could produce 12 in the same time span			1
" so as we applaud extraordinary performance in this operation , " concludes @entity155 , " we are left contemplating a discovery that means we are likely to soon face even more daunting challenges in the days and months ahead			0
" in a political campaign filled with too many diversions , these are the challenges we should be arguing about on the @entity7 anniversary			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			2

is president @entity11 's team exploiting @entity7 's death for political purposes ?
@entity166 says the answer is yes , but other presidents have done similar things
he says the real question is whether the world is safer after @entity7 is gone
@entity166 : other militant islamists are active ; @entity151 's *nuclear* *arsenal* is *worrisome*
