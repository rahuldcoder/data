-- we do n't mean to scare you ... no wait , actually we do , but only for a little while , and we promise the payoff will be worth the effort			1
these spots offer spectacular sights and experiences to travelers who are willing to face down five common , and very real , fears			1
all you 'll need to bring with you are curiosity and courage , says psychologist @entity14 , director of the @entity15 at @entity16			1
when we 're in a situation that makes us fearful , " we have to have the curiosity to say let 's see what happens if i see this through , which is not easy to do , and the courage to not do what we 'd normally do in this situation , try to escape			2
" 6 destinations with a dark side the trick is allowing the potential for enjoyment and excitement to outweigh your hesitation over trying something that creates anxiety			1
the treat is the feeling of accomplishment you have when you overcome your fear			1
these five places offer both risks and rewards			1
but do n't overdo it			2
if you have a paralyzing phobia , you 'll probably want to start a little smaller and closer to home			2
afraid of the dark ? @entity47 there 's a reason that people throughout history hid out in caves			1
caves are filled with eerie rock formations , subterranean waterways and bats ( which can be scary in their own right ) , but mostly caves are very , very dark			1
you have to be brave to explore them			2
or do you ? with 9,023 caves , @entity47 offers more underground scenery than just about any place on earth			1
start with the easiest : @entity65 ( jama is the @entity47 word for cave ) is the busiest cave in @entity70 , receiving hundreds of thousands of visitors each year			1
the space is massive enough to accommodate a concert hall , a speleobiology station for the study of cave fauna and an underground railway that will carry you along a two - mile route past weird , glistening limestone formations all illuminated by electric light			2
when you 're ready to move on to darker realms , the cave beneath @entity83 offers 45 - minute guided tours with only flashlights for illumination			1
( if you chicken out , you can retreat to the castle , which dates back to the 13th century			2
) @entity91 , a @entity92 not far from @entity47 's border with @entity94 , is another popular spot for cavers brave and timid			1
afraid of heights ? @entity98 , @entity99 hiking the segment of the @entity101 that goes to @entity98 is a dream trip for plenty of people , but most of them do not have a fear of heights			1
for while the standard four - day hike , which starts after a three - to four - hour ride from @entity113 , is rated as moderate - to - difficult in terms of energy and experience levels , the steep , narrow @entity110 mountain paths could put an acrophobic on high alert			2
what 's the reward for rising above your fears ? @entity98 , built in the 15th century , is the " most amazing urban creation of the @entity125 at its height , " according to @entity122 , which placed the site on its @entity92 in 1983			2
it has weathered earthquakes , torrential rains , and nearly 600 years of existence , and it remains a remarkably well - preserved complex of buildings once used for living , working and worshipping			2
dozens of licensed , local tour operators conduct guided tours to @entity98 , as do @entity137 firms such as @entity138			2
all recommend spending at least two days in @entity113 to acclimate to the altitude before beginning the climb to @entity98 , which tops out around 9,000 feet			0
advance arrangements are critical as there are limits on the number of visitors to the ancient site			0
afraid of @entity148 ? @entity149 if creepy - crawlies get under your skin , consider them in a different context			1
@entity155 at @entity155 in @entity149 will help you			0
as far back as anyone can document , spiders have been positive symbols in @entity160 cultures , associated with weaving and with women , since weaving traditionally is done by women			0
in @entity167 culture , the legend of @entity165 is , essentially , the legend of how the @entity167 came to be expert weavers			0
according to @entity169 , a @entity167 guide and storyteller whose family - owned company @entity172 runs guided hikes and 4x4 tours through @entity155 , @entity165 also wove blankets in which she wrapped up naughty little kids , then she 'd eat them and spit out their bones to make the white stripes on @entity155			0
( but maybe that 's just something his grandma told him so he 'd behave )			0
it 's certainly true that the twin - peaked @entity155 is among the more recognizable sights in @entity155 , which has the unique distinction of being the only @entity137 @entity189 located on @entity167 tribal lands			1
there are hikes and drives you can do without a guide , including the @entity196 that leads to @entity155 , but guided tours complete with explanations of the area 's significance to @entity167 culture add to your appreciation			0
afraid of enclosed spaces ? @entity204 , @entity205 few places on earth will give you chills like the @entity204 , not merely because at less than three feet wide they are a claustrophobic 's nightmare but mainly because of their history			1
built in the 1940s during the @entity214 occupation of @entity205 , the tunnels became a powerful tool for the @entity216 during the @entity217 , allowing them to attack and then vanish underground to escape capture			0
yet the tunnels were n't only a strategic weapon : inside the nearly 125 - mile tunnel network , dug by hand and ingeniously booby - trapped for protection , people lived and worked			0
once the tunnels were discovered during the war , teams of @entity137 and @entity227 soldiers known as @entity228 infiltrated them , sometimes crawling through spaces as little as 12 inches wide to recover military information and supplies			0
today the @entity204 are a day trip from @entity235 ( formerly @entity235 ) and are part of most tour programs to the area , such as the @entity240 tour offered by @entity138			0
yes , the tunnels still arouse strong feelings and opinions about politics and war , but beyond that they are a tremendous testament to people 's resilience and resourcefulness during wartime			0
they also will put your fear of enclosed spaces into perspective			1
afraid of the dead ? @entity257 , @entity258 do n't think of @entity259 as a cemetery			1
think of it as a well - tended horticultural park with pretty one - and two - mile walking trails and lots of beautiful @entity266 foliage from blazing red @entity268 trees to fall - blooming @entity269 to 26 different species of oak			0
that 's sort of what its founders had in mind when , in 1831 , the @entity276 purchased the 72 acres that would become @entity259			0
you can choose to see @entity259 purely as a park			0
the visitor 's center sells maps for self - guided theme tours on horticulture , architecture , art , and other topics , and runs excellent docent - led tours on weekends			0
eventually , though , you 're bound to become curious about the people at rest in @entity259 , and you 'll find that they include outstanding figures from all fields of endeavor , including poet @entity294 ; @entity295 , creator of the " @entity296 " ; scientists and thought pioneers such as @entity299 , @entity300 , and @entity301 ; as well as jurists , artists , statesmen and business leaders			0
you 'll also learn ( thanks to the " not so @entity308 " guided tour ) that many of the ordinary folks buried here have fascinating life stories as well			1
" we return to the world , and we feel ourselves purer , and better , and wiser , from this communion with the dead , " said @entity313 in 1831 when the cemetery was consecrated			0
those remain words to live by .			0

not *fleeing* when facing anxiety has its own rewards in these fascinating places
caving in @entity47 is one way to conquer a fear of the dark
the @entity101 offers a true uphill *challenge* for travelers who are afraid of heights
