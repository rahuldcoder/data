@entity0 -- a majority of justices raised questions in oral arguments wednesday about the federal @entity6 , indicating the @entity7 may strike down a key part of the law that denies legally married same - sex couples the same benefits provided to heterosexual spouses			1
a ruling is expected within three months on the constitutionality of the 1996 law that defines marriage for federal purposes as only between one man and one woman			0
wednesday 's arguments concluded two days of presentations before the high court on one of the most prevalent social issues of this era -- the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed and receive the full benefits of law provided to heterosexual couples			2
afterward , @entity32 , 83 , stood on the steps of the courthouse -- near the " @entity36 " slogan engraved above -- and proclaimed something she hid for decades before her challenge against the act known as @entity6			1
" i am today an out lesbian , ok , who just sued the @entity41 , which is kind of overwhelming for me , " she said			0
she had just watched almost two hours of oral arguments before the nation 's highest court on how she had to pay higher estate taxes than someone in a heterosexual marriage			2
@entity32 tried to explain to reporters why she and her late spouse , @entity32 , married in @entity50 when the law allowed it after decades together			0
16 brave and humorous signs on same - sex marriage @entity56 , she said , is " a magic word , for anyone who does n't understand why we want it and why we need it			1
" " we did win in the lower court , " @entity32 added , then later predicted : " i think it 's gon na be good			1
" under @entity6 , @entity63 , pension and bankruptcy benefits , along with family medical leave protections and other federal provisions , do not apply to gay and lesbian couples legally married in states that recognize such unions			1
@entity32 was forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than heterosexual married couples would have to pay			2
because her decades - long partner was a woman , the federal government did not recognize their same - sex marriage in legal terms , even though their home state of @entity50 did			1
" what kind of marriage is that ? " the court appeared divided along ideological lines during the arguments about whether @entity6 is discriminatory and steps on state marriage laws for gays and lesbians			1
if legally married homosexuals were being denied more than 1,100 federal benefits , " what kind of marriage is that ? " asked justice @entity93 , who said the discriminatory effect is " pervasive			2
" " what gives the federal government the right to define marriage ? " asked justice @entity95			0
the potential swing vote , justice @entity100 , also questioned the reach of @entity6 , saying it presents a " real risk of running into traditional state police power to regulate marriage			1
" @entity100 's point caused court observers to speculate he would join the four normally liberal - leaning justices to create a majority against the act			2
on the other side , chief justice @entity109 repeatedly asked whether it would step on state power to do the opposite of @entity6 -- pass a law providing full federal benefits to any legally married same - sex couple			1
same - sex marriage and @entity6 : 5 things we learned from oral arguments when @entity32 's lawyer argued in court there was a " sea change " afoot today in support of same - sex marriage that leaves @entity6 outdated , @entity109 said that is because of " the political effectiveness of those on your side " swaying public opinion			1
@entity109 and justice @entity133 also suggested @entity6 could still remain in place as a valid extension of congressional authority , as 41 states do not allow same - sex marriage			1
@entity139 , the high - profile lawyer hired by @entity141 speaker @entity140 and fellow @entity143 legislators to defend @entity6 , suggested the act was passed as a " cautious approach " in response to initial efforts in some states to change state marriage laws to include homosexuals			1
" in 1996 something was happening " in the country , @entity139 said , adding that @entity151 wanted to created uniformity in the federal sphere and not sow confusion in states that did not want same - sex marriage			1
however , justice @entity159 drew an audible gasp from the packed courtroom by quoting from the official @entity141 reports of 17 years ago , when legislators stated one reason to pass @entity6 was to " express moral disapproval " over gays and lesbians being allowed to wed. it was not until 2004 that @entity168 became the first state to legalize same - sex marriage			1
no consensus was reached from the bench on the gateway or jurisdictional questions -- whether @entity175 were on solid legal footing when they stepped in and defended the law after president @entity178 and his @entity179 reversed their position by concluding @entity6 was unconstitutional			2
the administration changed its mind after initially defending the law before a federal judge hearing the @entity32 lawsuit			0
@entity109 tweaked @entity178 for not having " the courage of conviction " to continue enforcing the law even if he thought it was discriminatory			0
at a news conference later wednesday , @entity191 @entity190 of @entity192 called congressional @entity143 irresponsible for funding the defense of what she called a discriminatory law at a cost she put at $ 3 million			0
" on the basis of what i heard , the questions of the justices , the response of the participants , i 'm very optimistic that @entity6 will be struck down , " @entity190 said			2
hear , read the arguments for yourself " we did n't have horns " to @entity32 , wednesday 's arguments represented another step in the evolving history of gay rights in @entity41			2
for years , she said , she wore a circle of diamonds as a pin instead of a traditional diamond ring to hide her lesbian relationship from co-workers			0
victory for lesbian , years after her longtime partner 's death " we all lived , really , behind masks and in closets , indeed , " @entity32 explained			0
" so what happened is there was , as we increasingly came out , people saw that we did n't have horns			0
people learned that , okay , we were their kids and their cousins and their friends , all of whom were coming out for the first time			0
and i think it just , it just grew to where we were human beings like everybody else			0
and i really think that 's what made the change			0
" @entity244 , she told reporters : " i 'm talking to you freely			0
i 'd have been hiding in a closet 10 years ago			0
" public interest remained high outside the court in advance of wednesday 's session , but not at the same level as tuesday 's arguments in another case involving @entity192 's voter - approved ban of same - sex marriage			1
a smaller crowd gathered than the day before , with most of them opponents of @entity6			0
" i 'm here today because i 'm a social worker and i 've seen a lot of people suffer over the years , " @entity259 told @entity1			0
" and i 'm concerned about not getting people their human rights , their dignity as people			0
" conservative supporters of the law contend it codifies a fundamental cornerstone of society , and changing the definition of marriage would have widespread negative impacts			0
5 things we learned from oral arguments the @entity192 case during tuesday 's arguments , the justices seemed to lack consensus on both jurisdictional and constitutional questions relating to the voter - approved @entity192 law , known as @entity283 , which bans same - sex marriage			1
the overriding legal question in the @entity192 case is whether the @entity287 's guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from refusing marriage to a defined class of people			0
when it rules , the court could strike down laws across the country banning same - sex marriage , or it could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place , choosing to let state legislatures and state courts sort it all out			1
" this was a deeply divided @entity7 , and a court that seemed almost to be groping for an answer here , " @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity304 said after the arguments			0
key questions answered four of the more liberal justices seemed at least open to the idea that same - sex marriage should be allowed in @entity192			1
three of the more conservative justices seemed aligned with the view that marriage should only be for a man and a woman , and it 's likely they 'd be joined by justice @entity319 , who does n't speak at arguments			0
that could leave @entity100 as the swing vote , as has often been the case			0
while admitting the law 's defenders are " not just any citizens , " @entity100 raised concerns about whether just the possibility of same - sex marriage was enough to establish they had suffered harm -- a key jurisdictional hurdle allowing them to appeal in the first place			1
weigh your state with @entity1 's lgbt rights calculator nine states permit same - sex marriage among the 41 states that now forbid same - sex marriage , nine of them allow civil partnerships			1
nine other states allow same - sex marriage , and about 120,000 same - sex couples have gotten married , according to estimates			1
prohibitions seem to run counter to polls that show rising support overall for same - sex marriage			2
a @entity1 / @entity354 poll released on monday found 53 % of @entity41 now support same - sex marriage , up from 40 % in 2007			2
as to how the federal government should handle the issue , another @entity1 / @entity354 poll out tuesday found 56 % of the public feels the federal government should also legally recognize same - sex marriages			2
