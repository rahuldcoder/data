a swell of excitement is building in @entity4 after the nation woke up to the news it will be a wildcard entry in perhaps the biggest , brashest , most talentless singing contest in the world : the @entity11			1
" move over @entity19 " was the common sentiment on @entity13 as @entity4 mulled which of its performing artists was up to the task of waving a sequined @entity4 flag in @entity18 in may			1
a few naysayers pointed out discrepancies in the world map			0
but if @entity26 's prince @entity25 can have an @entity4 knighthood , why ca n't @entity24 's biggest land mass muscle in on a traditionally @entity29 contest ? perhaps it 's even time to change the name ? @entity11 explained the logic in an effusive press statement pointing out that @entity4 's inclusion would help the contest " walk the talk " of this year 's theme " @entity37			1
" " it 's a daring and at the same time incredibly exciting move			0
it is our way of saying ; let 's celebrate this party together ! " said @entity40 , the contest 's executive supervisor			2
as dr. @entity11 -- aka academic expert @entity48 - points out in his blog , the contest already includes countries outside @entity29			1
@entity19 ? @entity52 ? " having a country over the other side of the world take part is entirely in keeping with the general ethos of the competition , " he wrote			0
" @entity11 is huge down under , 3 million people watched the show last year			1
with so many @entity29 expats ( and those @entity4 of @entity29 descent ) it makes sense for @entity4 to be invited to the party			1
" this year marks 60 years of the contest , which will pit performers from 40 countries against each other for the honor ( and the huge expense ) of hosting the event in 2016			1
the competition is known for its kitsch songs and outlandish performances			0
last year it was won by bearded drag queen @entity77			2
this year , @entity4 will be allowed to vote in the semi-finals and grand final , which is watched by some 195 million people worldwide			1
some even dared to dream ...			0
what if we win ? the nation that loves @entity11 also loves to gamble			2
so it was n't long before @entity86 offered odds on who would take on the formidable task of out - eurovisioning the experts			0
early favorites were " x-factor " entrant @entity92 , former " @entity95 " winner @entity94 and fellow " idol " singer @entity96 ( who performed in the interval last year )			2
outside bets were placed on cricketer @entity100 and actor , producer and singer , @entity103			0
the bookie is paying out $ 251.00 should prince @entity25 appear on stage			0
stranger things have happened .			0

@entity4 will be " one - off " entrant to mark 60 years of @entity11
song contest has a huge following in @entity4 ; three million people watched last year
