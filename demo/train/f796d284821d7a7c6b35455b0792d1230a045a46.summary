@entity0 , @entity1 economic summit and hailed an airplane sales deal between @entity8 and an @entity1 airline			1
@entity3 was in @entity0 , @entity1 , for the @entity5 meeting in a region that accounts for more than half of the world 's gdp			1
he held bilateral talks with @entity16 , the @entity17 and @entity18 beforehand			0
@entity3 helped announce a large plane order for @entity20 - based @entity8 to @entity21			1
" for the last several days , i 've been talking about how we have to make sure that we 've got a presence in this region , that it can result directly in jobs at home , " @entity3 said in a statement			2
" and what we see here -- a multibillion - dollar deal between @entity21 -- one of the fastest - growing airlines not just in the region , but in the world -- and @entity8 is going to result in over 100,000 jobs back in the @entity20 , over a long period of time			2
" he said more than 200 planes were in the order			0
@entity5 leaders , meanwhile , agreed that @entity40 can chair the regional bloc in 2014 , amid some signs of reform			1
some critics say it is still too early to award the high - profile role to @entity40 , where between 600 and 1,000 political prisoners are believed to remain behind bars			1
the @entity50 leg of @entity3 's trip follows two days spent in @entity52 , where he declared that the @entity20 will increase its military presence and expand its role in shaping the @entity33			1
" our enduring interests in the region demand our enduring presence in this region , " @entity3 told the @entity52 @entity56			2
" the @entity20 is a @entity33 power , and we are here to stay			1
" he announced an agreement with @entity52 on wednesday that will expand military cooperation between the longtime allies and boost @entity20 's presence in the region			2
in a speech a day later , @entity3 made it clear that the military expansion is a top priority in the wake of the @entity74 and @entity75 wars , even as the @entity20 faces the need to reduce mounting federal deficits and debt			1
" as we end today 's wars , i have directed my national security team to make our presence and missions in the @entity33 a top priority , " @entity3 said			1
" as a result , reductions in @entity20 defense spending will not -- i repeat , will not -- come at the expense of the @entity33			1
" the speech on the second day of his two - day trip to @entity52 , @entity3 's first as president , signaled a policy objective to compete head - on with @entity93 for influence in the region while also providing security assurances for allies			2
deputy national security adviser @entity98 told reporters that the policy comes in part from nations of the region seeking increased @entity20 presence			2
" the ability of the @entity20 to help respond to contingencies is something that has been welcomed in recent years , whether , again , it was work that we 're doing in the @entity17 to counter violent extremism , work that we 're doing to counter piracy in the region , the response to the tsunami in @entity1 , " @entity98 said			0
" so in other words , there 's a demand signal from the nations of the region , and this is something that we 're doing in concert with one of our closest allies			0
so we believe it 's not just entirely appropriate , but an important step to dealing with the challenges of the future of the @entity33			0
" under the military agreement announced wednesday , up to 250 @entity20 @entity128 will be sent to @entity130 and the northern region of @entity52 for military exercises and training			0
over the next several years their numbers are expected to climb to 2,500 -- a full @entity128 ground task force			0
before departing @entity52 for @entity1 , the president , along with some @entity128 , visited a military base in @entity130			0
while speaking to the troops there , @entity3 thanked them for their service and praised the two nations ' alliance , which is now 60 years old , and said he looks forward to a deepening of the alliance			0
going forward , our purpose is the same as it was 60 years ago -- " the preservation of peace and security			0
and in a larger sense , you 're answering the question once posed by the great @entity152			0
of @entity52 , he wrote , ' hath she the strength for the burden laid upon her , hath she the power to protect and guard her own ? ' " the president 's @entity52 visit -- postponed twice in 2009 and 2010 due to the massive oil spill in the @entity162 and other domestic political considerations -- highlights a changing balance of power in the @entity33 as @entity93 expands its military reach and the @entity20 works to reduce its military footprint in @entity167			1
