@entity19 , @entity20 : hi , i 'm @entity22 and this is @entity0 ! anyone looking to make money this summer by cutting lawns might have some metallic competition			1
the explanation on that is coming right up			1
first up : @entity30 @entity31 : but first , we are reporting on president @entity33 on his trip to the @entity35			1
he is in @entity36 , and early today , he was scheduled to make a major address at a university in the capital city of @entity40			1
his main focus was the @entity44 - @entity43 conflict , a source of tension in the region and around the world			1
we 'll have more coverage of the president 's speech in tomorrow 's show			1
as we 've reported , the goal of this trip is to reset relations between the @entity56 and the @entity58 world			1
yesterday , we looked at a poll about how @entity56 view @entity58 countries			1
in a recent survey , 14 percent of people in those nations , those @entity58 countries , have a favorable view of the @entity56 , while a vast majority , 78 percent , have an unfavorable opinion			1
before he arrived in @entity36 , @entity33 began his @entity35 trip with a stop in @entity69			1
he spoke about the importance of visiting the country			2
@entity56 president @entity33 : i thought it was very important to come to the place where @entity75 began and to seek his majesty 's counsel and to discuss with him many of the issues that we confront here in the @entity35			1
word to the @entity84 @entity85 , @entity20 : a word to the @entity84 ... dissident ( noun ) someone who disagrees with something , such as an opinion or belief source : www.dictionary.com @entity2 @entity31 : today marks the 20th anniversary of @entity5 's violent response to a group of dissidents protesting in @entity98 's @entity2			1
the demonstrators , many of whom were college students , were speaking out against political policies in the communist nation			2
their protests drew the attention of the world			1
@entity107 looks back at the events that led up to the historic moment			1
( @entity110 ) @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 : in the spring of 1989 , the elements for a perfect storm were coming together in @entity98			2
by the late ' 80s , a new mood was being felt in the socialist world			2
old ways were being challenged			2
in @entity5 too , students and intellectuals were finding new voices , openly discussing taboo topics like democracy and freedom			1
even within the communist party there were those who saw reform as the only way forward			2
and then on april 15th , a momentous death			2
@entity130 , once the head of the @entity132 , had spent the last two years of his life in obscurity			1
he had fallen foul of hardliners for his reformist views			2
what followed was a staggering outpouring of grief and anger			2
thousands of students flocked into @entity2			2
while efforts were made to keep students out , they repeatedly broke through police lines			2
and amazingly , in a country with no free press and tight controls on foreign media , the world watched these events unfold			1
by coincidence , the world 's media happened to be in @entity98 for a historic summit between @entity5 and the @entity156			1
from expressions of grief , the students moved to demands , including a new appraisal of @entity130 , a free press and the right to protest			2
workers , civil servants and others all joined the crowds in @entity2			2
similar demonstrations broke out in cities throughout @entity5			1
domestic media began reporting on the events with unprecedented independence			1
upping the ante , the students declared a hunger strike			2
in meetings with government officials , their demands grew more strident			2
but after weeks of soft persuasion by moderate officials , the party elders had had enough			2
the reformist general - secretary @entity183 made an emotional last public appearance			2
in a surprise visit to the square , he told students , " we have failed you			2
" and yes , that 's @entity191 , @entity5 's current prime minister , standing right next to him			1
that night @entity183 was removed from office , and prime minister @entity193 declared martial law			2
" @entity197 " is soon unveiled and becomes a rallying point for the hundreds of thousands now gathered there			2
the occupation continued until the night of june 3			2
tanks rumbled through the streets of @entity98			0
and in the early hours of june 4th , 1989 , the @entity202 's @entity201 opened fire			1
the @entity204 initially reported 2,600 people died over the two days , but later retracted that figure			0
the official figure stands at 241 dead and 7,000 wounded			0
perhaps the most enduring image of @entity2 is what happened on june the 5th			0
this lone protester stood defiantly in front of a line of tanks			0
the world watched and held its breath , until onlookers dragged him away			0
the " tank man " captivated the world and , to this day , his identity remains a mystery			0
@entity107 , @entity0 , @entity113			0
( @entity221 ) @entity7 @entity31 : a powerful image			1
the @entity2 demonstration , and especially the image of that single protester and the tanks , became famous			0
but @entity5 often tries to downplay the event			1
this week , one official referred to it as simply " a political incident that took place in the late 1980s			0
" and as @entity233 shows us , the government does n't seem too keen on coverage of the anniversary			1
( @entity110 ) @entity233 , @entity238 , @entity98 : these plainclothes officials are using these umbrellas here to block our view whenever we try and do any videotaping anywhere near the square			0
they 're also carrying these walkie talkies , right there			0
that gentleman has a walkie talkie			0
so does this other gentleman here			0
authorities are also rounding up dissidents			0
many , they say , according to some reports , in fact , have been sent out out of town			0
university students , too , have also been warned to watch what they say , and there is also heavy security around many of the schools and some of the bigger campuses in @entity98			0
and right now , as you can see , these officials continually blocking our view to try and stop us from filing any kind of report from @entity2			0
( @entity221 ) @entity269 @entity270 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity273 's social science classes at @entity274 in @entity275 , @entity276			1
which of these is not a type of grass ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity287 , b ) @entity286 , c ) millipede or @entity289 ) @entity290 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity287 , blue and centipede , sure ; but there 's no such thing as millipede grass			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! no more yard work ? @entity31 : no matter what kind of grass you 've got this time of year , it all needs cutting			1
it 's not a fun chore , as many of you know , and some folks might even hire you to take care of it for them			1
but if you 're looking for an automated option , and you have just a few thousand bucks to spare , a new mini-mower may be right up your alley			0
@entity315 explains the unique yard service			0
( @entity110 ) @entity317 , @entity0 correspondent , @entity318 : this summer , the @entity320 family wants to spend more time playing and less time working			0
@entity321 , homeowner : it 's actually nice to not having to be outside for hours doing yard work for hours on a saturday afternoon @entity325 : they 're hoping this little robot can help			1
@entity320 : my son decided to call it " mowie			0
" @entity325 : its real name is " automower , " a battery - operated and self - charging device that could give your lawn that freshly mowed look and you 'll never even break a sweat			1
so , how does it work ? simply program the times you want it to start and stop , then a wire installed around your yard lets automower know where to cut and guides it back home when it needs recharging			1
@entity349 , product manager , @entity350 : it can operate day , night , rain , wind , does n't matter			0
@entity354 is designed to be out there whenever you need it out there , regardless of the weather conditions			0
@entity325 : and this gadget is just as " green " as the grass it clips			0
the automower does n't use gas or oil and gives off zero emissions			0
plus ... @entity349 : you do n't have to have chemicals or fertilizers to put down			0
the grass decomposing actually acts as a natural fertilizer			0
i think you are going to see more traditional mowers that will have alternative fuels , more traditional mowers that will have battery technology			1
this is the way that the industry is trending			0
@entity325 : @entity315 , @entity0			0
( @entity221 ) stay in touch this summer @entity31 : after tomorrow , our show is taking a two - month break			0
but we 're not going away completely over the summer ! at @entity384 , we 'll be posting new blogs and putting new stories in the @entity388 section			0
plus , we 'll be updating the official @entity0 student news facebook page			0
plenty of ways for you to spend your summer with @entity0 ! before we go @entity31 : and finally , it is normal to see animals hanging out in trees			0
not quite as normal when it 's a bear			1
and even less normal when that tree is in the middle of a neighborhood ! but that is what happened in @entity402 this week			0
the bear found himself a nice perch and just kind of hung around for a while			0
eventually , it just came down on its own			0
which experts say is the right way to handle this situation			0
goodbye @entity31 : so remember , the next time you see a bear in a tree , just leaf him alone			0
yeah , i know it			0
but there 's just one more show to go this school year , so we hope you 'll bear with us			1
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity22 .			0
