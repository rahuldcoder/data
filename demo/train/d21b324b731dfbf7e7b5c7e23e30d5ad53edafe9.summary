-- you 'd be hard - pressed to find a major sporting event these days without its own dedicated smartphone app. no longer is it enough to simply watch the action , devoted fans are now demanding a blow - by - blow account , interactive maps and player profiles all in the palm of their hands			2
for young fans especially , such apps have become the must - have accessories -- and @entity16 golfing bosses have finally caught on			1
for the first time in six years , spectators will be able to use their mobile phones at the @entity20 this summer after organizers lifted a ban on monday			1
mobiles had been barred at the golf season 's third of four major tournaments -- this year to be held at @entity27 -- since 2006 after players complained about distracting ringtones			0
but ruling body the @entity30 has now relaxed the ban for the july 15 - 22 event , and fans will be able to make calls in designated areas -- though photography and video recording is still banned			1
and to coincide with this , the tournament now offers its own mobile experience			0
" we are offering spectators access to an enhanced range of apps for @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 that will offer live video of play and other attractions at @entity20 and will keep them up to date with essential championship information including scoring , tee times , news and an interactive course guide , " @entity30 chief executive @entity42 said on the @entity30 website			1
" there is no denying the attachment people feel to their mobile phones both in terms of gathering information and staying in touch with family and friends			0
we understand this and allowing their use at the championship will enrich the @entity20 experience			0
" the decision follows a @entity74 announcement in february last year that ithe @entity76 circuit would finally be lifting its phone ban			1
after allowing mobiles at five test events , chief of operations @entity85 said at the time : " allowing mobile devices on - site at @entity88 was a tremendous fan enhancement , and did not affect the integrity of the competition			2
" however , the phone rules only apply to @entity74 events , not the other three majors -- the masters , @entity93 or @entity94			1
the @entity30 said it will continue to monitor the decision			2
" we understand there will be concerns over this change in policy but we will be liaising with spectators at the championship to ensure calls are not taking place near play , " @entity42 said			0
" our spectators are very knowledgeable and understand golf , and so we are confident they will respect the players			0
