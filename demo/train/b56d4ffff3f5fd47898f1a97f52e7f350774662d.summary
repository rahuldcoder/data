-- the big cats are out of the bag after the @entity4 and @entity5 players selected for rugby union 's prestigious @entity7 tour of @entity9 were unveiled in @entity10			1
@entity7 coach @entity17 has chosen 15 @entity18 , 10 @entity19 , nine @entity5 and three @entity12 players in his combined 37 - man squad for the three - @entity16 tour which begins in june			1
the announcement was a relief for @entity18 flanker @entity22 , who had been sworn to secrecy by @entity17 after being named as captain on his debut @entity7 tour			1
" it 's been the hardest thing , lying to my friends for over a week ! " said the 24 - year - old , who is the youngest tour captain in @entity7 history			1
" @entity17 phoned me up to tell me nine days ago			2
i put the phone down and punching the air was my first reaction			0
" i 've had to tell hardly anybody and that 's been very difficult			0
i told my fiancee and parents but that was it			0
" the boys at the @entity44 were asking me if i wanted to go out for food and things like that , " added @entity22 , referring to his @entity18 club			2
" they were trying to catch me out but i would n't let anything slip			0
" if i went through my career without playing for the @entity7 , i 'd be so gutted			2
it 's by far the biggest accolade any @entity4 or @entity5 player could achieve -- it 's the ultimate , so i 'm absolutely thrilled			0
" there was no place in the squad , however , for @entity56 captain @entity55 or @entity56 's 2003 @entity57 winning hero @entity58			1
@entity58 , who now plays in @entity59 for @entity60 , effectively ruled himself out of contention for the @entity7 tour , pointing instead to young fly - halves @entity64 and @entity65 , who have both been selected for @entity7 kicking duties			1
" i asked @entity58 if he could tour and he said he was n't available			1
i would n't have made the phone call if it was n't to offer him a place on the tour , " @entity17 said			1
" he appreciated the call , but i think physically he would struggle to do a tour			0
he was honest about himself and said ' i 'm hanging on with my fingernails here at the moment and i probably need another operation '			0
" we asked him about what happens if there is an injury later in the tour and he said ' we can have that conversation later if that crops up			0
' " @entity81 great and 2005 @entity7 captain @entity82 was also included , with the 34 - year - old centre chosen for his fourth successive tour			1
despite retiring from @entity56 duty last season , @entity56 prop @entity86 was added to the @entity7 squad			2
@entity92 's @entity91 - born wing @entity90 was also included although there was no place for outside half @entity95			2
" we spent a long time selecting this squad and there were some close calls with a lot of competition for places , " said @entity97 , who coached @entity98 to @entity99 -- the northern hemisphere 's annual tournament -- success in 2013			2
" when it came down to it there were three or four positions where we had to make a call between one player and another			0
" there 's been so much speculation and so many opinions			0
and that 's what selection is - it 's a matter of opinion , and it 's our opinion			0
" but ultimately we chose the players who will give us the best chance of a test series victory			0
a @entity7 tour to @entity9 only comes around once every 12 years and we believe we have the right balance in the squad to be successful			1
" the concept of a combined touring @entity7 side began in 1891 when a group of @entity19 and @entity12 players took part in a three - @entity16 series against @entity135 under the auspices of the @entity137			1
in 1899 , the tourists fielded players from @entity56 , @entity92 , @entity98 and @entity81 for the first time as they traveled to @entity9 to provide them with their first international competition			1
the @entity7 head @entity142 again in 2013 determined to avenge their defeat by the @entity144 in 2001			0
the tour begins in @entity146 against the @entity147 -- an international invitational side based in @entity4 -- on june 1 and the first test against @entity9 follows on june 22 in @entity150 .			2
