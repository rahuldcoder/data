editor 's note : @entity2 is president of @entity3 , a nonprofit institute that researches attitudes toward extremism			1
@entity6 co-directs the @entity8 @entity7 at the @entity9 , a think tank that promotes ideas across the ideological spectrum			0
@entity12 says @entity13 overwhelmingly favor better relations with the @entity15			1
( @entity16 ) -- in a new public opinion poll before @entity13 's critical june 12 presidential election , by large margins , most @entity13 said they support an @entity15 - @entity13 rapprochement for bringing a new era of peace to the @entity8			1
surveyed on a wide range of issues , @entity13 overwhelmingly favor better relations with the @entity15 and greater democracy for @entity13			1
the poll shows that the @entity13 public remains far removed from the stereotypes of apocalyptic fanatics commonly asserted in some circles in the @entity15			1
the survey suggests that @entity13 instead are a people with self - confidence and hope in a more democratic future			2
it also reveals a population with a strong awareness that the @entity15 is as much a potential ally as it is now seen as a current threat			2
this holds much promise for @entity15 national security interests in the region			2
these are some of the many findings from a new nationwide public opinion survey of @entity13 , to be released monday			0
independent and uncensored nationwide surveys of @entity13 are rare			0
typically , pre-elections polls in @entity13 are either conducted or monitored by the @entity13 government and other affiliated interest groups			0
consequently , they are notoriously untrustworthy			0
by contrast , our poll -- the third in a series over the past two years -- was conducted by telephone from a neighboring country , uncensored , with time - tested methodology			0
funding for the survey was provided by the @entity61			0
the poll was led by @entity63 and the @entity9 , with fieldwork by @entity65			0
the full results and methodology are available at @entity68			0
the survey was conducted from may 11 to 20 , with 1,001 random interviews proportionally distributed covering all 30 provinces of @entity13 , and a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points			0
though our poll results show president @entity78 in the lead , it appears that that none of the presidential candidates will pass the 50 percent threshold needed to automatically win ; a second - round runoff between the two highest finishers -- as things stand , @entity78 and @entity83 -- is likely			1
regardless of whom they may vote for , the no. 1 priority @entity13 have for their government is improving the @entity13 economy , very closely followed by ensuring free elections , a free press and better trade and relations with the @entity96			0
it is in this context that the @entity13 people strongly support a fundamental change in @entity15 - @entity13 relations			1
right now , @entity13 consider the @entity15 and @entity102 as the greatest -- and only -- threats to @entity13			1
as a result , more than six out of every 10 @entity13 oppose any peace deal with @entity102 and are in favor of the government of @entity13 providing military and financial assistance to @entity110 groups such as @entity111 and @entity112 , as well as providing military and financial assistance to @entity116 @entity115 militias			1
a majority of @entity13 also favor @entity13 developing nuclear weapons			2
these " hard - line " attitudes dramatically change , however , as part of a potential deal with the @entity15			2
more than 70 percent of @entity13 favor providing full access to inspectors and a guarantee not to develop or possess nuclear weapons , in return for outside aid and investment			2
in another consistent trend over the past two years , 77 percent of @entity13 also back normal relations and trade with the @entity15			1
indeed , as part of a deal with the @entity15 , 54 percent of @entity13 would endorse the @entity13 government ending support for @entity116 militias instead of providing military assistance			1
rather than supporting the destruction of the state of @entity102 , as they do now , as part of a deal with the @entity15 , a majority of @entity13 would even favor recognizing the state of @entity102			1
greater democracy , economic progress and good relations with the @entity15 are the ultimate goals for most @entity13			1
in another indication of the public 's strong support for a more open and fully democratic system of government , 77 percent said they support a political system where the supreme leader , along with all leaders , can be chosen and replaced by a free and direct vote of the people			0
the vision of the @entity13 people for a more democratic future , with normal trade and relations between @entity13 and the @entity15 , remains the consensus over our three nationwide surveys			1
@entity13 also view their support for @entity78 -- or whoever might be elected the next president of @entity13 -- as consistent with those goals			1
the @entity13 people are apparently looking to their next president , whether or not it 's @entity78 , to be a @entity173 @entity172 going to @entity174			1
they want a tough negotiator to bring home a deal for @entity13			2
his mandate is not to continue current hard - line polices with the @entity15 but to change -- if the @entity15 , in turn , is willing to recognize the @entity182 and end its policy seeking regime change in @entity185			0
for @entity186 , this means that the @entity13 people are not an obstacle and that a real bargain can be struck that would find popular support			2
but the @entity13 people are endorsing a negotiating position that leaves little time and much room for miscalculation			0
president @entity195 needs to integrate this reality into his strategy for the greater @entity8 and , once the elections are complete , engage @entity13 on the potential of a new strategic relationship			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity6 .			0

@entity2 , @entity204 : most @entity13 are not extremists ; they favor peace with @entity15
they say poll shows overwhelming support for negotiations
poll finds @entity13 support for a deal regardless of whether @entity78 is re-elected
