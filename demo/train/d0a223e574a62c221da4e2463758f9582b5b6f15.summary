-- it is an attacking arsenal to make any soccer side in the world quiver			0
and @entity5 champions @entity4 wasted little time in underlining its emboldened firepower en route to a 2 - 0 victory over @entity9 in the @entity11 final			1
in truth , little else was expected of a team that took the field in the @entity18 capital @entity16 to reports that at a reputed cost of $ 612 million , it was the most expensive ever assembled in the sport			1
the focus was largely on its new recruits , @entity27 's @entity26 poster boy @entity25 , and @entity28 , who lifted the trophy in @entity30 with @entity31			1
but it was the world footballer of the year @entity33 that shone yet again , even taking the gloss off @entity36 , the world 's most expensive player who was back in his hometown			1
two fine goals from the @entity41 star helped the @entity43 holders ease past its @entity45 counterparts in front of a capacity crowd			2
the first was provided by @entity36 , a hometown hero who said prior to the clash that @entity4 were gunning to win all six titles on offer to them this season			1
the second was the result of another fine move , as @entity33 was released by @entity57 striker @entity56 , before slamming the ball into the top corner			1
@entity4 's dominant performance sent out an ominous warning to its domestic and @entity5 rivals with the new season poised to burst into life			1
" obviously it 'll take a little bit of time for everyone to settle in but i think we played very well tonight , " @entity36 told @entity65			2
" we gelled as a team and we 've got a lot of time to improve			0
" the most important thing for us tonight was to get the job done , get the trophy and go down in history			0
" everybody comes to @entity4 to win trophies , we want to play with the best players in the world			2
we 're going out to win every trophy this season			0
" successful soccer sides seldom stand still and no - one can accuse @entity85 's men of doing that this summer			0
the @entity87 giants , who ended a long wait for their tenth @entity43 crown last season with victory over city rivals @entity93 , have bolstered their ' galatico ' ranks in typical fashion			2
a huge amount of buzz has centered on @entity25 , the 23 - year - old who proved a revelation at the @entity26			2
his six goals helped @entity27 to the quarterfinals for the first time in its history , and secured him the golden boot -- awarded to the tournament 's top scorer			0
@entity25 looked a little ring rusty on his first competitive outing for his new club , a heavy first touch often belying the skill he showed in @entity30 , when the ball seemed to be attached to his foot			2
the star , known the world over by his first name -- pronounced ha - mes -- did show some silky touches and forced @entity9 goalkeeper @entity118 into one fine save with a powerful volley			1
@entity4 's other new recruit looked sharper and more comfortable in his surroundings			2
unsurprising , given that @entity28 ' last outing saw him help @entity31 to lift the @entity26 crown			0
signed from @entity124 , the 24 - year - old controlled the midfield and showed he can by the lynchpin behind a wealth of attacking talent			0
@entity4 eased into a confident stride early in the match despite most of its stars having only recently returned to training due to their @entity26 exertions			0
@entity36 , roared on by the @entity18 fans inside the stadium , drew a save from @entity118 after prodding a @entity25 cross towards goal before @entity140 was forced to save a shot from @entity9 midfielder @entity142			1
@entity33 's first effort of menace on the night was smartly saved by @entity118 , the goalkeeper standing tall to repel his shot after neat work from @entity56			0
but five minutes later @entity33 , who scored a record 17 @entity43 goals last season , did find the net as he slid in to fire home from @entity36 's pinpoint cross			1
the @entity41 repeated the feat in the fledgling stages of the second half as @entity56 released him inside the area , @entity33 's shot flashing into the corner			0
chances came and went as @entity9 tried to fashion a way back into the game , @entity25 going close before @entity33 was denied a hat - trick thanks to a vital tackle from @entity164			1
@entity164 and @entity165 went close in the dying stages for @entity9 before a fine save from @entity118 denied @entity36 the goal he and the large portion of @entity18 fans so desperately craved			1
real then took that familiar climb up the stairs to accept its first silverware of the season			0
one down , five to go .			0

two goals from @entity33 help @entity4 claim the @entity11 title
real beat fellow @entity87 side @entity9 2 - 0 in the @entity18 capital @entity16
