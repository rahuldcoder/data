-- @entity1 was always adept at curling the ball around a wall -- but when it came to the barrier of homosexuality in football , he broke straight through it			1
former @entity9 captain @entity1 , who announced his retirement from football thursday , was the first superstar footballer to embrace his " gay icon " status , freely giving interviews to gay magazines and openly talking about his gay fan base			1
that attitude was the catalyst for a change , according to author and journalist , @entity21			0
" what @entity1 did was break the long silence about homosexuality in football , " @entity21 told @entity0			1
" before @entity1 came along , it was basically a taboo but he changed all that			1
" he openly courted his gay fan base , saying he loved being a gay icon and was happy for his wife to broadcast that around			2
" he was the first to give interviews to gay magazines -- before that , no footballer would have done that			0
" he also changed the way footballers were looked at			0
he was inherently good looking , but it was that he paid so much attention to his appearance that was unprecedented			0
" in an interview with the @entity40 given in 2007 , @entity1 spoke of his pride at being tagged as a " gay icon "			1
" maybe it 's things like ( the fact ) i like to look after myself , i like to look smart and presentable most of the time , " he said at the time			0
" i always liked to look good , even when i was a little kid			0
i was given the option when i was a page boy once of either wearing a suit or wearing knickerbockers and long socks and ballet shoes -- and i chose the ballet shoes and knickerbockers			0
" once @entity21 spent five months trying to organize an interview with the midfielder , only for the player himself to sanction the piece after reading one of the journalist 's articles on football and homosexuality in four four two magazine			0
" @entity1 read the piece i did about how far football had come in dealing with homophobia , " @entity21 recalled			1
" i know he was very moved by the fact i wrote how he had opened the door to change and that is what swung getting me the interview with him			1
" look , there are 92 league clubs in @entity9 with each squad having around 20 players , so statistically , there must be some gay players , " added the journalist			1
" one day it will be common place for footballers to come out and @entity1 will have played a part in that			1
" he opened the door and it is the person who opens the door who makes the difference			1
" @entity1 said to the world : ' i 'm straight , i 'm the @entity9 captain and i think it 's cool people are gay			1
' " despite @entity1 embracing his " gay icon " status , football continues to struggle with homophobia			1
last february , @entity99 football star @entity98 announced he was retiring from football after " coming out " -- leaving @entity102 player @entity101 as the only openly gay player in @entity104			1
@entity98 might yet make a return given he has been training with @entity106			0
@entity1 was also key in footballers becoming fashionistas and attracting interest from the mainstream media , according to @entity111			1
" @entity120 football fans do n't want 11 neatly coiffured and manicured players to admire , " said the journalist and celebrity biographer who has written books about @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118			2
" they 're more attracted to the old - fashioned kind of player like @entity124 or @entity125 if i 'm honest			0
" but @entity1 was someone who was proud to be a gay icon and made it cool too			1
" just look at the number of metrosexuals who have emerged since @entity1			2
" it 's now ok for players to have silly , floppy hair and dress in the way they do			2
" players now try to trend it like @entity1 more often than they try to bend it like @entity1			1
from wearing his wife 's underwear to parading around in a sarong , the former @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity106 , @entity144 and @entity145 man has never been one to shy away from experimentation			0
while former @entity152 @entity151 has gone on to establish herself as a leading fashion designer , it is @entity1 who brought men into the 21st century with his eye for the latest trends			2
from his outrageous hair styles to his love of grooming and moisturizing , @entity1 relaunched the notion of the metroxsexual along with his very own brand of cologne			2
whether it was by provocatively modelng in his @entity169 underwear or being paraded in front of the press in another exquisitely tailored suit , @entity1 set the bar high when it came to looking sharp			2
" @entity1 was the antithesis to the godawful lad culture of the @entity178 , " @entity175 fashion editor @entity174 told @entity0			2
" being a footballer who was clearly motivated by fashion trends and absolutely loved clothes , he turned the idea of what it meant to be a stylish sportsman at the time on its head			0
" sure he made some mistakes along the way ( cornrows ) , but that 's what made him a trendsetter -- he always led and never followed			0
" he was certainly one of the first celebrities to de-stigmatize grooming pursuits that were previously seen as girls - only ( his early penchant for highlights comes to mind )			0
" lots of people would say that it helps he has an athlete 's body , but there are plenty of sportsman who dress appallingly			0
" i think it 's his willingness to try new things combined with a clear appreciation for a good tailor			0
" he might have worn the occasional eye - raising get - up when he was younger , but it always fitted perfectly			0
" that infamous sarong , which he was pictured wearing in 1998 , was certainly one " eye - raising item " but as @entity21 explains , @entity1 had no regrets			2
" when i interviewed him in 2006 , i asked @entity1 if he regretted wearing that ' dress '			1
he said : ' no , that 's one of the things i 'd do again ! ' "			0

@entity1 ' opened the door ' for it to be cool to be gay

@entity1 *insisted* he would wear ' that dress ' again
