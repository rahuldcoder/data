@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a base accustomed to deploying @entity5 into some of the most hostile war zones , you would expect some hesitancy when units from here were asked to surge into some of the worst fighting since the start of the war in @entity15			1
this week , the first of 1,500 @entity5 will be part of the initial wave of president @entity20 's surge plan to head to @entity15 's restive provinces to support @entity5 and soldiers fighting a dug - in @entity24 force			1
however , many @entity5 we talked to in this coastal , scrub pine - covered @entity1 base are more than excited to go , despite the dangers that await them			1
" i 'm absolutely ecstatic about the situation			1
i 've got a good group of @entity5 that are behind me , so i 'm real excited about the deployment , " said sgt. @entity32 of the @entity33 , a company , 2nd @entity34 , based at @entity0			1
but combat deaths in @entity15 are up -- 305 this year , from 155 during 2008 -- giving pause to even the most motivated @entity5			1
" i think i would n't be human if i was n't worried , obviously this being my first combat deployment , but the @entity24 are an experienced group of fighters , and i 'm not taking that for granted , " 2nd lt. @entity42 , also of the @entity33 , said during some of his final rifle range training before he deploys			2
members of this unit say they have been waiting and waiting as they watched fellow @entity5 deploy ahead of them this year , and they say they are more than ready to go			2
they were supposed to go to @entity48 in june , but as priorities shifted , they were reassigned to @entity15 's @entity51 province , where @entity5 are in daily battles with the @entity24			1
" having months to train and putting @entity5 out in the elements in @entity54 , where we train , gives them a chance to see what the atmospherics are going to be like and to work as a team , so this is perfect , and we are really looking forward to this , " @entity42 said			2
" these guys have a lot of training under their belts , more than @entity5 units typically get in this situation			1
senior military leaders have a lot of big expectations for this team , " said the unit 's first sergeant , @entity69			0
last week , the chairman of the @entity76 , adm. @entity75 , gave some of the deploying @entity5 an impassioned speech about what they will face			1
" we do n't have a lot of time			0
the slope on this insurgency is going in the wrong direction , and it has picked up , three years , each year to a significant degree , " @entity75 said , describing the deteriorating security situation			0
" i believe the strategy that the president laid out , the decision that he 's made , is the right decision			0
both those are right , and we will now move out , given our orders , and we 'll carry them out			0
and again , i could n't be more confident and more pleased that you are going to be at the core of that , " he told the hundreds of @entity5 in attendance			2
many of the @entity5 there are young and are facing their first combat deployment			1
although all the bravado of a newly minted @entity5 ready for combat looks and sounds ready to fight , their eyes showed worry and concern for the unknown as they listened to @entity75			1
" best thing you can hope for is that you personally know yourself , that you 're not going to freeze up , " @entity111 @entity110 said after @entity75 's speech			0
" we 'll see how i react when it goes down in a couple weeks , " said @entity111 @entity115			0
questions remain , however , about how so many @entity5 without combat experience in @entity15 can jump into a heated combat zone			1
" we 're obviously not in an ideal situation with respect to that			0
i understand that , but i have a huge amount of confidence in our @entity5 based on their ability to adapt , what they did in @entity48 , " he said			2
there seems to be little worry among unit leaders in the 3/2nd @entity135 , who have been training and watching their troops grow in skills and confidence in recent months			0
" one thing about the @entity5 is that you always have experience wherever you go , " @entity42 said			1
" so we 've got @entity5 that have done deployments before and the training they have given me , i 'm confident to where i can lead my platoon , but i 'm also relying on staff @entity146 ( non-commissioned officers ) that have years of experience			1
" that experience we have from the different deployments in @entity48 , i 'm relying on all the @entity146 to carry their weight , and with that i do n't think there is anything that can get in our way , " @entity42 continued			2
for the families of these @entity5 , deployments are never easy , especially when they know that their husbands and wives are moving to a region known for its hostility			2
" i 'm glad he 's going where he 's needed			2
it would be a waste for him to go where he 's not needed and not be able to do his job , " said @entity164 , wife of deploying @entity5 lt. @entity165			1
" it 's just not him in the @entity5 , it 's our family , and we are proud to be a part of it , " she said			1
@entity164 and her three kids , ages 1 , 3 and 5 , will watch @entity165 leave for @entity51 on his first combat deployment in a few weeks			0
she appears strong for a young mother , but all the preparations a family does can sometimes bury reality			0
" well we 're thankful he 's going to be with us for @entity184 , so we just want to enjoy the time we have together			0
" but @entity164 's eyes close , and she fights back tears that become a sob			0
" i think when we actually say goodbye , it 's going to be hard , but we 'll get through it , and we want to enjoy the time we do have together , " she said			1
families on this base are their own support system			0
wives of @entity5 with husbands who have deployed numerous times help younger families get through the first deployments			2
" it 's very difficult , i think , for people outside the military community to understand what they have to go through , " said @entity5 capt. @entity200 , who returned from his third combat deployment to @entity15 weeks ago			1
his wife , @entity206 , a veteran of keeping the family together while @entity200 is away , agrees			0
" i do n't think when you have ' x ' number of deployments under your belt that it makes it any easier ; you just know what to expect			0
you know what to expect next time as far as how you need to manage things			0
sometimes you worry about them more ; sometimes you worry about them less , " she said .			0

" i 'm absolutely ecstatic about the situation , " says sgt. @entity32
questions remain on how @entity5 without @entity15 combat experience can jump right in
