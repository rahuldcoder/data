@entity0 is accusing @entity1 of having " intentionally destroyed evidence " related to the explosion aboard an oil rig in the @entity5 that led to the worst oil spill in @entity8 history			1
the accusation comes in court papers filed by @entity0 monday in federal court in @entity12 as part of a lawsuit aimed at having sanctions imposed on @entity16 , which was a contractor for @entity0 on the @entity18 oil rig			1
an explosion on the rig on april 20 , 2010 , killed 11 people working on the rig and injured 16 others			1
the explosion led to more than 200 million gallons of oil being released into the @entity5			1
@entity0 alleges in its filing that @entity1 destroyed evidence on cement testing and violated court orders by not bringing forth " inexplicably missing " computer modeling results			1
" @entity1 has steadfastly refused to provide these critical testing and modeling results in discovery			2
@entity1 's refusal has been unwavering , despite repeated @entity0 discovery requests and a specific order from this court , " the documents state			1
" @entity0 has now learned the reason for @entity1 's intransigence -- @entity1 destroyed the results of physical slurry testing , and it has , at best , lost the computer modeling outputs that showed no channeling			1
more egregious still , @entity1 intentionally destroyed the evidence related to its nonprivileged cement testing , in part because it wanted to eliminate any risk that this evidence would be used against it at trial , " the @entity0 papers say			1
when reached for comment monday , @entity1 spokeswoman @entity51 said the company was reviewing the details of the motion			2
" however , we believe that the conclusions that @entity0 is asking the court to draw is without merit and we look forward to contesting their motion in court			2
" the @entity0 documents state that two @entity1 employees testified under oath about destroying notes and samples related to analyzing the stability of a similar cement mixture that was used in the failed oil well			1
" [ @entity70 ] id you take down any notes about the slurry ? " @entity74 in @entity75 was asked during a deposition detailed in the court motion			0
" no , ma'am , " @entity78 responded			0
" you did n't take any pictures ? " " no , ma'am			0
" " and then you said you dumped out the sample ? " " yes , ma'am			0
" " and you mentioned that the reason that you did n't document the test and you threw out the sample was because you were worried about it being misinterpreted in the litigation ? " " yes , that 's part of the reason , yes , ma'am , " @entity78 testified , according to the @entity0 papers			2
@entity0 is seeking to have a " third - party specialist " examine a @entity1 computer , saying " such an examination might well recover the missing modeling results , or shed light on the circumstances of their apparent disappearance			1
" @entity0 and its two contractors -- @entity1 and @entity98 , which owned the @entity18 rig where the explosion occurred -- have been locked in legal battles since last year			1
in september , the final federal report on the spill said @entity0 , @entity98 and @entity1 all share responsibility for the deadly explosion and ensuing oil spill			1
the three companies " violated a number of federal offshore safety regulations , " according to the report , which was issued by the @entity111			0
the report concluded that a key cause of the explosion was a faulty cement drilling barrier at the well site			2
" the precise reasons for the failure of the production casing cement job are not known , " the report stated			0
but the disaster was " the result of poor risk management , last minute changes to plans , failure to observe and respond to critical indicators , inadequate well control response , and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling " at the site			0
@entity0 was " ultimately responsible " for operations at the site " in a way that ensured the safety and protection of personnel , equipment , natural resources , and the environment , " the report concluded			0
but @entity98 , as owner of the rig , also was " responsible for conducting safe operations and for protecting personnel onboard			0
" meanwhile , @entity1 -- as a @entity0 contractor -- was " responsible for conducting the cement job , and ... had certain responsibilities for monitoring the well , " the report said			1
a spokesman for @entity0 said in september that the company agreed with report 's conclusion			0
" the @entity18 accident was the result of multiple causes , involving multiple parties , including @entity98 and @entity1 , " @entity156 said			1
" @entity0 ( has ) acknowledged its role in the accident and has taken concrete steps to further enhance safety			0
... we continue to encourage other parties to acknowledge their roles in the accident and make changes to help prevent similar accidents in the future			0
" but in response to the report , @entity1 continued to deny any responsibility for the tragedy			0
the report " incorrectly attributes the operation decisions to @entity1 , " said @entity174 , a @entity1 spokeswoman			2
" every contributing cause where @entity1 is named , the operational responsibility lies solely with @entity0			2
@entity1 remains confident that all the work we performed with respect to the ... well was completed in accordance with @entity0 's specifications for its well construction plan and instructions			2
" besides the oil , hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemical dispersant went into the water			0
at the peak of the crisis , in june 2010 , 37 % of @entity5 waters -- a total of 88,522 square miles -- were closed to fishing due to contamination .			0

@entity1 was a contractor for @entity0 at the ill - fated @entity18 oil drilling operation
@entity0 and its contractors have been locked in legal battles since last year
an explosion aboard the @entity18 killed 11 and injured 16
the explosion led to more than 200 million gallons of oil being released into the @entity5
