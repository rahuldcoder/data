@entity0 -- the police investigation of @entity6 's death is " officially closed " with the conclusion that her death was an accidental drowning , the @entity2 said wednesday			1
with the case closed , police released the recording of the 911 emergency call in which a hotel security officer said the woman who called for help from @entity6 's room was " irate and pretty much out of it			1
" investigators " found no evidence of foul play , " a police statement said			2
" based on the findings of our investigation and our review of the coroner 's report , we have determined that this is not a criminal matter			1
" the @entity30 coroner released its autopsy report a week ago saying @entity6 's february 11 death was an accidental drowning with the " effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use " as contributing factors			1
the @entity40 security officer did not identify @entity6 in the 911 call			1
" i need paramedics , apparently i 've got a 46 - year - old female , found in the bathroom , " he told the 911 operator			2
" that 's all i 've got right now , but they 're requesting paramedics			2
" ( @entity6 actually was 48 )			2
the autopsy report said her assistant found @entity6 face down in a tub of " extremely hot water " about 12 inches deep			1
" i 'm not sure if she fell , or if she was in the bathroom with the water , " the hotel security officer is heard saying in the 911 call			1
and you do n't know if she 's conscious or breathing at all ? " the dispatcher asked			2
" apparently she was n't breathing , " the hotel employee said			0
when the dispatcher asked if she had started breathing , the security officer said " i do n't know			1
the person that called me was irate and pretty much out of it			0
" " can you get me into the room so i can try to give cpr instructions ? " the 911 operator asked			2
" no , because she kept hanging up on us , " the hotel security officer said			1
@entity6 was last seen alive by her personal assistant in her @entity40 hotel room about 3 p.m. that saturday , the autopsy report said			1
the assistant left to run errands after telling @entity6 to take a bath in preparation for a @entity84 party at the hotel that night , it said			2
when the assistant returned to the locked room at 3:35 p.m. , she found @entity6 " lying face down in the bathtub filled with water , unresponsive			1
" " the assistant called for her bodyguard , and together they pulled the decedent out of the bathtub , " the report said			2
when paramedics arrived about 10 minutes later , they moved @entity6 to the living room floor			2
it was at 3:55 p.m. , 20 minutes after she was found by the assistant , when paramedics concluded she was dead , the report said			2
the coroner 's report stopped short of detailing what happened to @entity6 , but @entity105 's dr. @entity104 , an addiction medicine specialist , examined the autopsy report for @entity1 and suggested that she might have suffered a seizure brought on by the use of cocaine , possibly combined with a withdrawal from alcohol and a prescription sedative			1
an empty bottle of the anti-anxiety drug @entity116 was found in her room , but the level of the sedative found in her blood was low , he said			0
empty beer bottles were also found , but alcohol was not detected in her body , he said			0
" to me , a sudden drop - off in the @entity116 level , a drop - off in your alcohol consumption , add cocaine , that 's a recipe for a seizure , " @entity104 said			0
" somebody who 's now upside down in a bathtub could easily seize and drown			0
" however , @entity134 , a toxicologist and director of the @entity136 , said the level of @entity116 found in @entity6 's blood was not low enough to trigger a seizure			1
those who abuse @entity116 can take up to 20 pills a day , he said , and the level found in @entity6 's body would indicate she took four to six pills several hours before she died			1
since the drug was found in her blood , a seizure brought on by withdrawal is unlikely , he said			0
the coroner 's report notes that @entity6 suffered several small scald burns on her face at the time of her death			1
a 60 % narrowing of her arteries found in the autopsy is " very mild heart disease , " @entity104 said , which should not have caused a problem			0
@entity134 said that based on his experience with cocaine abusers , two things may have happened : either @entity6 had a seizure and fell into the tub , or she had a cardiac arrhythmia			0
an arrhythmia occurs when the heart stops beating properly and fails to pump , depriving the brain of oxygen and causing a loss of consciousness			0
" if you look at cocaine deaths , more deaths are from arrhythmias than seizures , " @entity134 said			0
" based on what is in the report , it seems more likely that she had a vasospasm ( which shuts off blood flow to the heart ) or a fatal arrhythmia			0
" toxicology testing measured 0.58 micrograms of cocaine per milliliter of blood drawn from a vein in her leg during the autopsy , which @entity104 called a moderate level			0
@entity134 said for that level of cocaine to be in @entity6 's body , " we 're talking about approximately half a gram of cocaine having been possibly ingested within 30 minutes to 90 minutes before her death			1
for someone who has been abusing cocaine , this may be their routine amount , but ( for ) someone who does n't regularly use cocaine and therefore does n't have a tolerance for the drug , this would be a high level			0
" @entity6 's cocaine use appeared to have occurred " in the time period just immediately prior to her collapse in the bathtub at the hotel , " chief coroner @entity213 told reporters when he released the preliminary report last month			1
investigators found " a small spoon with a white crystal like substance in it and a rolled up piece of white paper " in the bathroom where @entity6 drowned , coroner 's investigator @entity222 wrote			1
" remnants of a white powdery substance " were found on a bathroom counter , @entity222 wrote			0
" i also collected remnants of a white powdery substance from out of a drawer and from the bottom of a mirror in the same drawer in the bathroom counter , " she wrote			0
detectives found a " plethora of medications bottles " in the hotel room , although the coroner concluded the prescription drugs " did not contribute to the death			1
" along with cocaine and @entity116 , the toxicology tests found other drugs in her body , including marijuana , the muscle relaxant @entity256 and the allergy medicine @entity258 , the report said			0
@entity6 won six @entity259 and sold 170 million albums , singles and videos over her career			0
in recent years , the singer 's accomplishments were overtaken by her struggles with drug addiction			0
@entity1 's @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report .			0

" i need paramedics , " said the hotel security officer who found @entity6 in the bathtub
a woman in @entity6 's room was " pretty much out of it , " the guard tells the dispatcher
