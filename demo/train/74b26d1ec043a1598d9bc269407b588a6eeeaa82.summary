-- a decade ago , over 1 million people in @entity2 were living with @entity3			1
only 143 of them were receiving treatment			0
the average cost of that treatment was more than $ 10,000 per year			0
being infected with @entity3 in @entity2 was akin to a death sentence			0
when i visited @entity2 in 2012 , the picture had changed			0
eighty percent of @entity2 living with @entity3 now had access to treatment			0
i met @entity13 , a mother of four , who received anti-retroviral treatment five years ago to prevent her from passing the virus to her baby while she was pregnant			2
@entity17 now takes medicine that allows her to work full time and care for her children			0
it costs about 50 cents per day			0
view full gallery : @entity2 , then and now on @entity24 , december 1 , we have an opportunity to make @entity17 's story a reality for more families by supporting an organization that is helping developing countries respond to three of the world 's biggest health challenges -- the @entity33			1
since it was founded in 2002 , the @entity33 has been a leader in the world 's successful response to hiv / aids , tb and malaria			1
@entity40 told , its efforts have saved nearly 9 million lives			1
opinion : wrong time to reverse course on hiv / aids the @entity33 also plays a key role in helping developing countries change the course of these three epidemics			1
for example , when people have early access to hiv testing and treatment , they not only save their own lives but they dramatically reduce their chances of infecting others			2
moreover , a simple preventive procedure like voluntary medical male circumcision lowers a man 's chance of acquiring @entity3 -- and potentially transmitting it to his partner -- by about 60 %			2
overall , effective prevention and treatment programs have helped reduce new hiv infections by a third since 2001			0
that last number is crucial , because preventing new hiv infections is absolutely essential to ending @entity67			1
developing a vaccine to prevent @entity3 remains critical , and scientific researchers are achieving exciting breakthroughs			0
in the meantime , we need to develop new technologies that women can use to protect themselves			0
condoms are a great way to prevent the spread of @entity3 , but they require the cooperation of both partners			0
interactive : @entity24 even if a vaccine or a revolutionary new prevention method were discovered tomorrow , our work would n't be over -- because they wo n't end @entity67 if they do n't reach people at risk			1
that is what the @entity33 has been so successful at doing for the past decade : delivering the best tools available to the people who need them most			1
the @entity33 does n't just provide money for pills and other health products			2
it channels its resources into training new generations of doctors , nurses , and health care workers			0
it helps developing countries build stronger health systems			0
this approach guarantees that the money donors invest in the @entity33 has a long - term impact on overall health and quality of life in dozens of countries			2
put simply : the @entity33 is n't just one of the kindest things people have ever done for each other -- it 's also one of the smartest investments the world has ever made			1
on monday and tuesday , leaders from around the world will meet in @entity119 for the @entity33 's fourth pledge conference , called the @entity121 , to raise the necessary funding for the next three years			1
' no longer a death sentence ' the gathering is a reminder that the @entity33 was founded by the world to address an urgent need			2
we still need the entire world 's support to continue the incredible progress we 've made			1
this @entity24 , we need governments , private donors , ngos , activists and leaders to reaffirm their commitment to an organization that has helped change the course of three epidemics			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .			2
