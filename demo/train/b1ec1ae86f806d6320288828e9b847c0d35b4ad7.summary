-- @entity1 is expected to move over @entity2 on friday and over southern @entity3 friday night after lingering over the @entity5 area dumping heavy rains for days			1
after making landfall on tuesday night as a powerful category 1 hurricane , @entity1 has weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm than a tropical depression			2
it came virtually on the same day , seven years after @entity12 devastated @entity5 and for some @entity1 felt too much like the deadly hurricane that is blamed for the deaths of 1,800 people			1
deja vu , man , " said @entity17 , the president of @entity18 , thursday as he surveyed the hard - hit town of @entity20 that was inundated by floodwaters and sludge			1
" there is more water here than @entity12			2
" but for the many that braced for the worse and were spared , friday is a day to breath a sigh of relief and to continue to clean up the mess @entity1 left behind			2
state government offices in at least 13 parishes would remained closed friday because of flooding and most others would reopen , @entity0 affiliate @entity34 reported			1
emergency crews were also trying to restore power to many			1
more than 827,000 customers -- down from 915,000 earlier in the day -- had no electricity across @entity2 , @entity44 , @entity5 and @entity45 , utility companies reported thursday			1
one company , @entity46 , reduced a high of 30,000 outages to 8,000 by thursday evening the bodies of a man and woman were found in 7 feet of water at a home in @entity18 , officials said late thursday			1
an autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of the death of the couple , described as being their 40s , @entity17 told @entity0			2
the two were found late thursday afternoon in the home 's kitchen			1
the house is on the parish 's @entity65 , said commander @entity67 of the @entity68			1
officials also intentionally breached a levee in @entity18 , southeast of @entity71			1
the move was needed to help drain floodwaters in the @entity75 and @entity76 communities			2
in @entity78 , @entity18 president @entity77 called for a mandatory evacuation for those living within a half mile of the @entity82			1
@entity5 gov. @entity83 said the move was a precaution because if the dam were to break it would only take 90 minutes for floodwaters to get to @entity88 , a town of about 2,200 residents			1
later thursday , @entity77 said he did not know how many people had been evacuated along the 54 - mile stretch of the river			2

an earthen dam on 700 - acre @entity78 in @entity45 was holding its own and not leaking late thursday , despite significant damage , according to the @entity116			1
agency director @entity117 said a " controlled breach " or spillway will be created at the @entity119 lake to relieve pressure and drain it			0
crews were working carefully overnight , moving in equipment to prepare for the operation expected to commence later friday once water levels drop a bit			0
" they do n't want to influence the level of the river any more than they have to			0
" residents of 19 houses and seven mobile homes , along with three businesses , below the lake were asked to evacuate			0
the @entity136 does not expect a catastrophic event , said spokesman @entity138			0
@entity117 agreed with that assessment			0
water levels in most affected areas will gradually subside friday , the hurricane center said , concluding its reports on @entity144			0
@entity144 moved into southern @entity2 thursday afternoon , bringing with it the possibility of flash flooding and tornadoes			0
