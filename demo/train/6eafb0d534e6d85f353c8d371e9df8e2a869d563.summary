@entity0 -- president @entity2 said friday that he would strike down a ban on same - sex marriage if he were on the @entity5 , and that he believed his administration was obligated to weigh in on a @entity8 case before the justices			1
speaking to reporters at the @entity11 , @entity2 opened up about his rationale for signing off on a government brief that was filed in an appeal of @entity8 's 2008 prohibition of same - sex marriage			1
the @entity18 brief submitted on thursday urged the high court to invalidate the ban			0
" let 's treat everybody fairly			0
let 's treat everybody equally , " @entity2 said			2
the issue could be a defining moment in @entity2 's presidency , similar to the political impact last year when the high court upheld the health care reform law that he spearheaded			2
the president and the nation have evolved on same - sex marriage it is rare for a president to become personally involved in the legal and political considerations in a @entity5 appeal , and sources say @entity2 spent a good deal of time reading up on the issue and articulating his views privately before the brief was filed			1
the administration is not a party in the @entity8 appeal , one of two same - sex marriage cases before the high court this term , and was not required to offer an opinion although the @entity18 often does so in important constitutional cases			1
sources said @entity2 made the final decision for the administration to submit a viewpoint and signed off on the wording			1
he said friday that he believed it was " important for us to articulate what i believe and what this administration stands for			0
" the @entity8 law , known as @entity63 , does not provide any rationale for " discriminating against same - sex couples , " @entity2 said			1
the evolution of the nation 's ' first gay president ' when faced with a question of whether that 's constitutional , @entity2 said it was " important for us to answer " honestly			1
" and the answer is no , " he said			0
@entity2 once supported only civil unions , but he described his position as evolving and declared during last year 's election campaign he was personally comforable with letting gays and lesbians marry			2
the president further raised expectations of an expanded view in the sweeping rhetoric of his inaugural address in january			0
much of the reasoning in any government brief would , in large part , reflect @entity2 's personal thinking , gained from his years as a former constitutional law professor			2
he offered a studied analysis of the issue			0
" what we 've said is that same - sex couples are a group , a class that deserves heightened scrutiny			1
the @entity5 needs to ask the state why it 's doing it , and if the state does n't have a good reason , it should be struck down			0
that 's the core principle , as applied to this case , " @entity2 said friday			1
" now , what the court may decide that if it does n't apply in this case , it probably ca n't apply in any case , " he continued			0
" there 's no good reason for it			0
if i were on the court , that would probably be the view that i would put forward			0
but i 'm not a judge , i 'm the president			2
" the new @entity2 has his heart on his sleeve @entity1 @entity5 producer @entity114 contributed to this report .			1
