-- in 1979 , @entity3 , then a young boy in @entity2 , saw the dramatic results of a military coup			1
watching on an old black and white television set , he and a group of his friends witnessed one of the nation 's generals being blindfolded and shot to death by a firing squad			2
shortly afterward , his family fled the instability of @entity2 and returned to his native @entity16			1
but @entity17 stayed with @entity3 , who told his story at the @entity20 conference in @entity21 , @entity22 , in july			1
he grew up to become an actor and found that he was increasingly being cast as a violent @entity17 or a terrorist			1
" how many terrorists could i possibly play before turning into one myself ? " " i had become ashamed of the other , the @entity17 in me			2
" after 28 years , @entity3 returned to @entity2 to film the nation 's 2008 presidential election and , as it turned out , to learn more about himself			1
" i realized that , when i 'd left the country , free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream			0
and now that i 'd returned , that dream had become reality , though a fragile reality			0
" in the first round of voting in @entity2 , no candidate attained the 50 % of the vote needed to gain the presidency , and an inconclusive runoff was held			1
people began questioning whether the elections were being manipulated			0
@entity3 said there was gunfire and he saw discouraging signs of a possible breakdown in civil order			2
" and my heart sank , because i thought , here we are again			0
here is another proof that the @entity17 is not capable of governing himself			2
and not only that , i am documenting it -- documenting my own cultural shortcomings			0
" but rather than erupt in violence , the crowd started chanting " we want peace , " and eventually , after new voting , a winner was certified and power was transferred peacefully , @entity3 said			1
" @entity2 taught me to look at people differently and to look at myself differently			0
and yes , we @entity17 can			0
" in his film , " an african election , " @entity3 told @entity0 in an interview , " the political system , the democratic system , is tested to the utmost			1
" the lesson : " you do n't have to rebel			0
you have the freedom to choose , and with that choice comes a responsibility			0
