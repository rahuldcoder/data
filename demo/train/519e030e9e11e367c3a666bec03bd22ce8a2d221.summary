-- drug dealers beware : if a client of yours overdoses and dies in the state of @entity7 , prosecutors there may charge you in the death			1
in what 's becoming a growing trend nationwide , @entity7 prosecutors are using aggressive tactics to curb rampant fatal drug overdoses in their communities , including revitalizing an old law that holds drug dealers responsible in the drug - induced death of a client			1
the " @entity27 for @entity29 " law allows prosecutors to pursue homicide charges against someone who has manufactured or sold a controlled dangerous substance -- including heroin , cocaine and methamphetamines -- that directly causes death			2
the statute was enacted in 1987 but was n't well known and was rarely used until recently			1
convictions on the charge carry a penalty of a maximum of 20 years in @entity7 state prison			0
the number of fatal drug overdoses more than doubled nationwide from 2000 to 2010 , with heroin - related deaths in particular increasing by more than 60 % , according to the @entity39			1
@entity40 , @entity7 , is not immune to the growing drug problem : fatal drug overdoses there doubled between 2012 and 2013 , from 53 to 112 deaths			1
prosecutor @entity45 wants to " raise the alarm " on the drug problem not just in his county , but across his state			2
shortly after he was appointed prosecutor in march 2013 , the county had eight overdose deaths in the space of one week			2
" i want to send a signal loud and clear -- we have a problem here of epidemic proportions of all the people dying of overdoses and that 's my challenge			1
and i 'm going to do something , " @entity45 said , adding that the liability law " is one of the tools in my tool chest to attack this problem			2
" by charging drug dealers under the law , the prosecutor says he has more leverage in moving up the drug - dealing chain , because dealers who are prosecuted know they can be facing serious jail time			1
@entity45 also changed protocols for how authorities respond to an overdose call and treat each with " all hands on deck " to better make the charges stick			2
a homicide detective is now dispatched with narcotic detectives to the scene and each case is treated as a homicide from the beginning , @entity45 says			0
" if you 're going to be a dealer , and that heroin is going to kill somebody , we 're going to take that death ... and we 'll treat it as a homicide , " @entity45 said			0
" if we track it back to the ultimate dealer , we 're going to charge you under the law for that death			2
" @entity45 also trains authorities on how to use @entity101 nasal spray on victims , a potentially lifesaving drug that can reverse opioid prescription drug and heroin overdoses			1
since april 2013 , @entity45 and his team have had 12 cases related to the drug - induced death statute , including one that resulted in a guilty plea , his office says			1
@entity7 law protects overdose patients from prosecution a guilty plea in november 2013 , @entity117 , 33 , pleaded guilty to manslaughter after dealing drugs to @entity119 , 27 , who died of an overdose 10 months earlier			1
@entity117 was sentenced to 7 1/2 years with no early release for manslaughter and 4 years to be served concurrently for a heroin possession charge , according to the @entity124			0
@entity0 contacted @entity117 in prison but he refused to talk to the network			0
senior assistant prosecutor @entity127 , who prosecuted the @entity129 case , said @entity119 was alone when he injected himself with a fatal dose of heroin january 17 , 2013			2
@entity117 had met @entity119 earlier that day and sold heroin to him			0
a few hours later , @entity119 was dead , @entity127 said			0
the evidence that made the overdose liability charges stick and ultimately led to a manslaughter guilty plea were explicit text messages exchanged between the two men and bags stamped with the words " @entity140 " located at the overdose scene that were traced back to @entity129			2
" heroin bags with that particular stamp had been flooding the area in @entity145 and ( authorities ) had been investigating @entity117 for that , " @entity127 said			0
@entity148 , @entity119 's mother , found him lying on the floor of their dining room			0
though he had battled substance addiction for years , he was sober in the seven months before his death , she said			0
" which really almost brings me to tears because those seven months were like ... ( he was ) our son again , " she said			0
@entity148 does n't know what triggered her son to go back to heroin that one last time			0
she deals with waves of different emotions , from shock and anger to relief			0
" maybe this could set precedent , " she said			0
" you know , to the other dealers ; that this could happen to you			0
" a rarely - used law @entity0 legal analyst @entity171 said this first - degree , strict - liability law is an " exceptionally rare criminal statute , " and notes that most strict - liability statutes are civil			1
the law explicitly says that in a court case , the defense can not argue that the victim knowingly contributed to his own death by taking the lethal drug -- removing any argument for or against intent to cause harm , @entity171 said			1
@entity40 certainly is n't the first @entity7 jurisdiction to charge under this law ; counties like @entity188 have consistently used this statute for years , said @entity188 prosecutor @entity190			2
@entity193 and @entity194 prosecutors ' offices have also increasingly been charging under the statute , with several cases this year alone			0
but the @entity7 law is " harsh in comparison to the majority of other states , " according to an article written by @entity198 in the @entity199 in 2004			2
states such as @entity204 and @entity205 classify drug - induced death statutes as a second - degree felony , and @entity208 and @entity209 punish it as a third - degree felony			1
in comparison , the alleged drug dealers arrested in connection to actor @entity216 's heroin overdose death in @entity217 will probably not be charged with anything more than criminal possession of a controlled substance , prosecutors say			1
the @entity7 law was enacted in the late 1980s and upheld by @entity221 in 1994			1
it was intended as a way for prosecutors to go after " upper echelon drug dealers , who oftentimes have no interaction with their buyers and are therefore virtually immune to homicide prosecution , " @entity198 said			2
though the intent of the law was benevolent in theory , @entity198 says the majority of cases in the beginning prosecuted " minors with no record or evidence of prior drug dealing			1
" in its first 17 years on the books , the charge was prosecuted just 32 times , according to the @entity243			0
of those cases , 25 involved friends of the overdose victim and only three involved prosecutions of actual drug dealers			1
@entity7 prosecutors say that the recent increase in the number of drug overdoses , as well as word spreading about law 's success , will ostensibly result in more charges			1
however , some prosecutors say another law enacted in 2013 allows for the " strict liability for drug - induced death " statute to be prosecuted with the intent that was originally envisioned			1
on may 2 , 2013 , gov. @entity263 signed the " @entity264 , " which grants immunity from prosecution if someone seeks medical assistance for a person believed to be suffering from a drug overdose			1
" in the past , there have been instances where persons were reluctant or unwilling to call authorities for help for fear that this might lead to an arrest or prosecution for illegal drug use or possession , " the state 's acting attorney general @entity271 wrote			0
@entity7 prosecutors suggest the latest law may help friends of victims be more willing to tell authorities who sold them the drugs in the moments after an overdose			1
while the future success of the overdose liability law remains to be seen , @entity148 hopes that some good can come from her son 's death			1
" @entity117 did n't put the needle in the arm , i get that			0
but i 'm happy he pleaded guilty , " she said of her son 's drug dealer			0
" it 's another dealer off the road			0
" opinion : we can prevent fatal @entity306 @entity0 's @entity307 and @entity308 and legal analyst @entity309 contributed to this report .			0

the law was first enacted in 1987
fatal drug overdoses doubled between 2000 - 2010 , @entity39 says
another law protects people with overdose victims if they spill source of drugs
