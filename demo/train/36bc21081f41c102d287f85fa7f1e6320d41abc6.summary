@entity0 -- remember rep. @entity2 ? the 2012 @entity4 vice presidential candidate ? he 's still a member of @entity5			1
he still represents @entity7 's 1st congressional district			1
and he still sits atop of the @entity8			0
@entity2 has fallen out of the national spotlight since the @entity4 election loss , and he has remained largely silent while @entity4 and @entity11 battle amid a federal shutdown over how to move forward on a government funding bill and raise the debt ceiling			1
@entity2 's recent reticence is more noticeable because the prominent fiscal matters front and center now highlight his area of expertise			1
he is known in @entity5 as the budget wonk , the expert on federal government and spending			0
his colleagues look to him for guidance			0
in recent years , he unveiled controversial budget blueprints that dramatically cut spending and altered entitlement programs such as @entity29 and @entity30			0
his budgets , titled " @entity32 , " became the defining documents for @entity4 fiscal policy			2
after stepping into the limelight of the presidential campaign last year , he became just as well known for his biceps as his budget , thanks to a @entity41 photo shoot			1
silence shattered while president @entity43 and @entity45 speaker @entity44 remain at odds over the shutdown and the debt ceiling , and while @entity45 @entity4 are involved in infighting , @entity2 dipped his toe into the shark tank			1
he broke his months - long silence with an opinion piece in the @entity54 , putting forward a new path -- how to break the crippling stalemate in @entity0 with ideas that even some democrats support			1
he did not emerge unscathed			0
@entity59 does n't mention @entity60 @entity2 took a measured tone in the op - ed. he placed blame on @entity43 for not being willing to negotiate but he implored both sides both sides to sit down at the negotiating table			1
@entity2 responds to criticism over op - ed his idea : his old idea			2
he proposed " commonsense reforms of the country 's entitlement programs			0
" 2016 ambitions ? ultimately , his timely emergence could be part of a larger plot			0
as a young politician with a bright future , speculation is rampant that he might be running for the @entity4 presidential nomination in 2016			1
that speculation grows louder especially as he plans trips to @entity83 and @entity84 , the first presidential nominating states			0
he will keynote a birthday fundraiser for @entity83 's @entity4 governor next month and he is to attend a fundraising breakfast for a congressional candidate in @entity84			1
while @entity2 released the op - ed , he continues to play the cautious card , however			2
@entity1 has asked every congressional member if they would support a " clean " government funding or debt ceiling bill with no strings attached -- something many @entity4 are demanding			1
@entity2 's office has not commented			2
in new book , @entity2 asks ' where do we go from here ? ' ears opened if his strategy is to speak little but make a big impact , @entity2 definitely made an impact			2
it might not have been the one he had hoped			0
@entity4 sen. @entity105 of @entity106 , who has broken with his party on various issues , championed @entity2 's op - ed. @entity109 , @entity105 said @entity2 's proposal is a " must read			1
" but not everyone was so enthusiastic			0
conservatives jumped on @entity2 's for omitting their central demand -- dismantling @entity60 - in the government shutdown and debt limit fight			1
a spokeswoman for the leader of that crusade , sen. @entity117 of @entity118 , aptly noticed the omission			0
" there is one big work missing from this op - ed. it 's start with an @entity126 and ends with @entity127 , " she tweeted			0
@entity2 was forced to go on defense instead of push his agenda			2
appearing on conservative talk show " @entity130 's morning in @entity132 , " @entity130 asked @entity2 if dismantling @entity60 was no longer a priority			1
@entity2 insisted that it still was			2
" @entity60 's an entitlement just like any other entitlement , " @entity2 said , according to @entity135			1
" if you look at the op - ed , i say we have to - ultimately we have to rethink all of our nation 's health care laws			0
" head of the @entity143 , @entity144 , came to @entity2 's defense			2
he echoed @entity2 's defense and said his op - ed included " @entity148 , " even though it did n't specifically mention it			2
at a weekly meeting of @entity45 conservative lawmakers that @entity2 regularly attends , he attempted to explain the position he laid out in the @entity54			1
but some conservatives still insist that @entity60 be tied to any deal			0
@entity2 dodged reporters after the meeting			0
opinion : goodbye to the strategy @entity4 knew was a fantasy the dilemma twenty years ago , @entity2 worked for the conservative organization @entity161 , which later became @entity161			1
while that organization successfully morphed from a group that promoted traditional fiscal conservatism and neoconservative foreign policies into a limited government @entity166 aligned group			0
is @entity2 an @entity161 @entity4 ? or a @entity161 @entity4 ? there lies @entity2 's dilemma			1
it 's the same scenario that is plaguing the @entity4 and also dictating the current debate in @entity0			2
@entity4 strategist and former @entity175 spokesman @entity173 his op - ed shows that he 's " the adult in the room			2
" " he felt that it was important for him to speak up to address the seemingly never - ending stalemate that we 're witnessing in @entity0 , " @entity173 added			0
but the conservatives intent on stopping the health care law at all political costs are n't interested in ending the stalemate if it does n't end @entity60			0
@entity185 , founder of the @entity0 - based @entity187 @entity186 , said she hopes the government shutdown leads to the chipping away of the health care law			0
" @entity2 is a numbers guy ; i just do n't like his numbers , " @entity185 said			0
@entity173 insisted that @entity2 has already proven his conservative credentials but his op - ed shows he 's a " realist " given the miniscule probability that @entity4 have in undoing the health care law			1
given the push back @entity2 has received , three years before the presidential election , @entity2 might have to decide if he 's going to be a " realist " or a modern day , tea party conservative if he aspires to higher political office			1
supporters stand by representatives , and government shutdown			0

@entity2 has fallen out of the national spotlight since last year 's @entity4 loss in presidential election
and the @entity7 @entity4 @entity45 member has remained largely silent during budget crisis
but he now has dipped is toe into the controversy , writing an opinion piece that *grabbed* attention
@entity2 offered ideas , called for negotiation but omitting @entity60 demands was noticed
