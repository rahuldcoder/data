-- we know the point of the @entity3 is to count us , one by one , to tally every last resident , but the massive project of course has more prying , if limited , interests			0
if the aqua - and black - tinted census form were a person , he would be like a slightly nosy seat mate on a plane , fitted out with an unfortunate ' 80s flair , someone oddly arbitrary in his inquiries while being intimately probing			1
beyond the primary accounting , we 're asked additional questions about the people we live with and our relationship to them ; whether we hold a mortgage or rent ; how old we are ; our gender ; whether we inhabit a second residence or even , alas , a prison ; and then , inevitably , how we categorize ourselves racially			0
the boxes i can check to mark myself have certainly multiplied over the decades , allowing not just a single @entity30 category but broken out most progressively , it would seem , to other boxes for @entity33 , @entity34 , even @entity35 or @entity36 -- and then the one for me , @entity32			2
the automatic response is to check this box , for that 's what i am , at least in my bloodlines : my parents are from @entity42 , which was where i was born			2
my family immigrated when i was 3 , and our predecessors inhabited the @entity46 for as long as can be recalled			0
but as i consider the box , i have to pause			0
perhaps it 's because i 'm a novelist , someone who spends his days telling stories in part by stripping away the surface realities , unraveling presumed identities , in the hopes of characterizing what it is and means to be alive			0
and thus my hesitance to mark the box			0
for despite a thorough pride in my @entity32 heritage and my wish to be no other , the complexities of what might seem a circumscribed identity ( surely not a tenth as vast as " white " or " black " ) still feel too numerous to be so neatly contained			2
for my @entity32 - ness , especially in the context of @entity67 , is like no one else 's : it is not at all like my first cousin 's , who immigrated in his 20s and had to learn the language as an adult ; not like my friend 's , who was born in @entity75 and grew up in a bustling enclave of @entity32 businesses and churches ; not like the @entity32 adoptee 's , who was raised in rural @entity80 or @entity81 , being maybe the only @entity30 person in the county			1
our shared heritage shows in our faces , but given the differing nature of our experiences and the character of our respective communities , each of us has profoundly varying conceptions of our sense of belonging , cultural ties , even future possibility -- in short , of who we are			1
if i had made up the census form , the @entity32 box would necessarily have dozens , maybe hundreds or even thousands of sub-boxes nested inside , boxes for whether we dream in the native language , for how often we @entity103 with folks in @entity105 , whether we wear shoes or go barefoot in the house , if we prefer our kimchee fresher or riper or perhaps not at all			1
each form would have to be an epic novel of boxes , its combinations approaching the infinite , a document so vast and particular and dense that the boxes themselves would at some point begin to blur , perhaps disappear , the marks coalescing into something so singular that they would eventually take on a life itself , which is always shifting , dynamic , at last uncountable .			1

@entity123 : if census form were a person , he would be the nosy seat mate on a plane
@entity129 will tick @entity32 box but knows his *korean* - ness in @entity67 is like no one else 's
@entity129 : " our shared *[* @entity32 *]* heritage shows in our faces , " but *similarities* are *superficial*
@entity129 says if he designed form , boxes would multiply , blur , become uncountable
