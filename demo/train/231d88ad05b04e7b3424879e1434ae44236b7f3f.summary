a deal aimed at imposing a ceasefire in @entity2 from this sunday was concluded following talks between the leaders of @entity6 , @entity2 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
yet despite 17 hours of talks in the @entity14 capital of @entity15 , during which president @entity16 was seen breaking pencils on his desk in frustration , some of the agreement 's most important provisions have yet to be clarified			1
and although @entity8 chancellor @entity21 and @entity7 president @entity22 proclaimed themselves satisfied with the deal , both should know the chances of a durable settlement remain slim			1
were the bloodshed to resume -- or , as is more likely , never stop -- what happens inside @entity2 largely depends on @entity16 ; barring direct @entity30 military involvement which remains unthinkable , the @entity6 leader maintains what strategy experts call " escalation dominance , " namely the ability to decide how much or little he wants to apply pressure , in the re knowledge that , even if @entity37 miscalculates , @entity6 will not pay a heavy price			1
all the indications are that , when he ordered his crack forces into @entity2 a year ago , @entity16 had no clear idea of @entity6 's " end game			1
" still , wars create their own strategic logic and appetite grows with eating			0
so when @entity16 discovered the seizure of @entity2 's @entity51 peninsula was swift and painless , he expanded his country 's objectives by supporting ethnic @entity6 separatists in the rest of @entity2			1
until recently , the assessment of @entity30 intelligence was that @entity16 's strategy was to support anti-government rebels in @entity2 as a bargaining chip to draw @entity2 away from its @entity62 - leaning aspirations , and lure it back into @entity6 influence			1
however , the latest @entity6 offensives indicate new objectives : @entity37 's troops are consolidating the separatist rebel enclaves into one larger unit under @entity6 control , most likely as a prelude to @entity2 's permanent territorial division			2
the aim may no longer be to draw @entity2 into @entity37 's orbit , but to destroy the nation , and condemn the remaining western rump of the country to the status of a failed state			1
there are other reasons why @entity16 may be in a rush to consolidate the @entity6 - held enclaves into one coherent entity			2
for without this happening , any long - term ceasefire will still leave the enclaves vulnerable to a sudden attack from @entity2 government forces			2
furthermore , the @entity6 enclaves as currently constituted are not economically viable ; consolidating them alongside @entity6 's own borders will make it cheaper for @entity6 to subsidize the region , which is what @entity37 will now have to do			0
and , finally , the extension of the @entity6 enclaves offers the advantage of eventually providing @entity37 with territorial continuity between @entity6 itself and the @entity51 peninsula which @entity16 has already legally incorporated into his country ; at the moment , the peninsula -- which otherwise does not enjoy a land link with @entity6 -- has to be supplied by an expensive and vulnerable ferry connection			0
in short the logic of @entity6 political and economic calculations appears to coincide into virtually guaranteeing a deep push into @entity2 , and a spike in the number of casualties and displaced persons			0
any resumption of the fighting on a scale that now looks likely will make it inevitable that @entity30 governments will start supplying weapons to the @entity2 military			0
but if @entity2 's firepower increases , the argument in many @entity30 capitals goes , that will increase the price @entity6 has to pay in terms of personnel and equipment , and thereby persuade @entity16 to stop this adventure			1
it is a risky game with long - term consequences for the @entity128 continent			0
the reality is that @entity2 's military does not need @entity30 - made military equipment ; it operates @entity6 or @entity132 - made one			2
so the chances are high that , once @entity30 governments -- and especially the @entity135 one -- decide to supply @entity2 with lethal military equipment , the supplies will come from the stocks of @entity132 - made weapons which are in @entity140 and @entity141 , eastern @entity128 's biggest nations			1
both border @entity2 , which makes the delivery of such weapons easy and unobtrusive , something @entity135 president @entity147 may prefer , in order not to foreclose any opportunity for a future diplomatic dialogue with @entity37			0
although details of such planning are being kept under wraps , @entity140 defense minister @entity150 has already acknowledged the possibility that his country 's military stocks may be used for this purpose			0
the outcome is almost exactly the same as what happened during the @entity162 civil wars of the 1990s , when the @entity135 surreptitiously supplied the @entity163 and @entity164 in the @entity165 with weapons to defeat the @entity167			0
that tactic worked at that time			0
but the snag is that @entity6 is not @entity167 : @entity16 has staked too much on his @entity2 adventure to accept anything which smacks of defeat			1
the result is , therefore , that @entity2 will settle down to a prolonged proxy conflict , in which the possession of every village or road will be closely contested , a bloody confrontation in which most @entity128 governments get involved , but none accept responsibility			2
and , as is often the case in such situations , the longer the conflict goes on , the less chances anyone has in controlling its protagonists			1
@entity6 is already finding it increasingly difficult to control ethnic @entity6 rebels in @entity2 , and that difficulty will only increase as times goes by			0
a large influx of weapons into @entity2 will also mean an expansion in the already considerable domestic black market for such weapons and a further boost for a variety of right - wing @entity2 militias , many of which are already fighting alongside @entity2 regular soldiers			0
@entity6 's allegation that @entity2 is under the control of " fascists " is nonsense but , if @entity2 seeks deeper into violence , extremists will increasingly come to the fore			2
it is this sort of ghastly , ghoulish fate which the deal that @entity7 and @entity8 brokered is designed to avoid			0
but the chances are that what was agreed is simply too little and too late to postpone a looming @entity2 nightmare .			2

despite a deal struck over @entity2 , the chances of a durable settlement remain slim , says @entity217
@entity217 : @entity16 's aim may be to destroy the nation , and condemn remaining western rump to status of failed state
