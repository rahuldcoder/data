we considered it to be a rebound year			0

@entity0 : i was recently in @entity29 and i noticed that a lot of the hotels that normally this time of the year receive spring breakers , mainly from the @entity8 , are completely empty			2
so , some of the things that you 're telling me do not correspond to the reality i saw there			0
@entity40 : we 're working on a transformation program for @entity29 to rehabilitate @entity43 [ the avenue that runs along the bay ] which is one of the landmarks of @entity29			0

what are the @entity6 government and the @entity19 doing to solve this problem ? @entity40 : @entity6 is a very large country			1
when you take into account the distance between @entity61 [ the most violent city in @entity6 ] and @entity63 , you 're talking about 1,400 miles of distance			0
@entity65 is 1,000 miles away and @entity66 about 1,600 miles away			0
that is equivalent to the distance between @entity69 and @entity70 or @entity69 and @entity71			0
@entity0 : but the fact still remains that violence is a serious problem in @entity6			0

the @entity8 remains the number one market , followed by @entity106			2

the major tourism destinations are perfectly safe , whether you talk about sun - and - beach resorts or inland destinations			1
