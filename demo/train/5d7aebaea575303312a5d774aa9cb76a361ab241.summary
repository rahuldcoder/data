it 's hard to believe it 's been 36 years since the first " @entity8 " extraterrestrial beastie burst out of @entity5 's chest and into moviegoers ' nightmares			1
but fans of the sci - fi / horror franchise , which sputtered out with 1997 's " alien : @entity14 , " are still eager to see what filmmaker @entity12 can do with the material			1
@entity12 , who made the respected sci - fi action thriller " @entity18 " and has a new movie , " @entity17 , " coming out march 6 , posted an @entity20 message last week implying his next film will be a new " @entity8 " project			1
according to the @entity23 , a @entity1 content partner , @entity12 will ignore the last two sequels in the series -- " @entity27 " and " alien : resurrection " -- and pick up the storyline after the events of the @entity32 - directed " aliens			1
" beyond that , details about @entity12 's " @entity8 " are still scarce			1
there 's no word about when the film might hit theaters or whether it would bring back characters from the earlier movies -- although star @entity41 is likely to return			0
a @entity12 reboot of " @entity8 " seems promising ( although we have n't seen " @entity17 " yet )			1
then again , @entity44 is more than capable of screwing it up			2
here are five ways they could blow it			0
do n't cast @entity41 sure , someone could make a great " @entity8 " movie without her			1
but why would you ? she 's a fine actress , she wants to do it and she would lend instant credibility to the project			0
luckily , @entity12 appears to agree			2
chatter about a @entity8 " movie began almost two months ago when the @entity59 filmmaker started posting " @entity8 " - themed concept art to @entity20 -- including images of @entity41 as her @entity63 character			1
@entity41 also has a role in " @entity17 " and has gushed about @entity12 's talent , fueling speculation that the two will work together again			1
keep the aliens exactly the same with their skeletal bodies , armored heads , dual sets of jaws and fangs dripping with venom , the " @entity8 " xenomorphs are among the most iconic -- and freaky -- creatures in science fiction			2
they 're also almost four decades old , originally created by @entity79			0
we 're not saying @entity12 should replace them with something totally different			2
make them more cunning and even scarier looking			0
it 's time for a refresh			0
thankfully , @entity12 seems to have done just that with his early concept art. have them attack @entity90 invading space aliens have been a science - fiction staple since at least 1951 's " @entity93			1
" but having a marauding alien terrorize @entity95 or scamper down @entity96 would look pretty silly			0
the " @entity8 " movies have generated suspense largely through the claustrophobic feel of humans trapped in enclosed spaces with deadly critters who might pop out at any moment			0
so instead of @entity90 , what about this : what if an alien stowaway or two infiltrate an exclusive space colony -- like @entity12 's own @entity110 ? it might be satisfying to see the toothy monsters wreak havoc on a bunch of pampered elitists			1
bow to ' @entity116 ' @entity118 's 2012 film " @entity116 " was a prequel of sorts to the first " @entity8			2
" and a rumored " @entity116 " sequel , if it ever happens , is expected to veer even further from the " @entity8 " mythology			0
nothing against that film or against @entity118 , the creative force behind the " @entity8 " franchise			0
but @entity12 should feel free to pursue his own vision			0
" alien : the musical ! " haha ! just kidding			0

" *district* 9 " director @entity12 will make a new movie in the " @entity8 " series
it will ignore the last two sequels and pick up the story after " @entity139 "
