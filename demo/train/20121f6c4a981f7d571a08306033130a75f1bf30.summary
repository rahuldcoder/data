@entity0 -- sen. @entity2 has gotten questions from the media lately at nearly every stop and in almost every interview about where he stands on combating the threat of @entity9			1
because he 's seriously thinking about running for president , his positions on major issues are being carefully scrutinized			2
in an interview monday on @entity14 , @entity2 was asked : " if a vote were to come to @entity16 to ask you to go to war against @entity9 -- and to call it that -- would you vote yes ? " " yes , " he responded , though he added that he 'd try to sunset the 2001 authorization for the @entity22 , a measure that the @entity25 administration is using as the legal basis for airstrikes against @entity9			1
it was passed shortly after the 9/11 attacks and has been used for military action against terrorism ever since			0
" i do favor doing something about @entity9			0
i would vote yes , " he continued			0
while @entity2 gave a general " yes " to the broad question of going to war with @entity9 , his position appears to be much more nuanced			1
and it 's possible he could be voting " no " to a key element of the president 's @entity9 plan in the near future			1
@entity2 has said he does n't support the arming and training of vetted @entity45 rebels to fight against the militant group			1
the @entity47 has already supplied arms to @entity45 rebels in the past year , and @entity2 said monday on @entity50 that it would be a " mistake " to ramp up that effort			1
" most of the arms we 've given to the so - called ' moderate ' rebels have wound up in the hands of @entity9 , because @entity9 simply takes it from them , or it 's given to them , or we mistakenly actually give it to some of the radicals , " he said on " this morning			2
" @entity16 plans to start voting as early as wednesday on arming and training the rebels			0
a provision is being added to a must - pass stopgap spending bill and is expected to pass in the @entity65			0
it 's also expected to pass in the @entity67 with bipartisan support , but the timing and process is not exact			0
it seems that if a measure came to the @entity67 that only approves the training / arming of @entity45 rebels , @entity2 would not support such action			1
his political adviser , @entity75 , told @entity1 that the senator " said he would vote to authorize strikes against @entity9 , not arm their allies			2
" and what if president @entity25 were to come to @entity16 , as @entity2 has requested , and ask for approval for airstrikes and arming the rebels , all in the same package ? @entity75 said , " there are a lot of variables and ( @entity2 ) will read the language " of any authorization measure brought forward before he makes a decision			2
" there will be many factors and the specifics are important , " he added			0
@entity1 's @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 says he does n't support arming @entity45 rebels in @entity9 fight
but he says " yes " when asked whether he would vote to go to war against @entity9
part of the president 's plan to fight @entity9 *includes* arming @entity45 rebels
