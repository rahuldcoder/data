it 's a well driven path for the motoring male : as middle age approaches , thoughts turn to acquiring a shiny sports car as wives , female friends and relatives shake their heads with despair			1
anyone who 's ever been lured by the siren call of a powerful engine can take comfort in the fact that , though they may be consumed by automotive obsession , they have nothing on the @entity21 brothers			1
@entity22 and @entity21 made a fortune in textiles during the last century			1
when it came to spending it , @entity22 's thoughts naturally turned to the sumptuous style and classic panache of the @entity31 sports car			1
not just one @entity31 , not even two , but 122 of them , amassed in secret alongside hundreds of other rare and expensive cars in their textile mill warehouses between 1957 and 1976			1
the secret did n't last and the collection is now housed in what could well be the world 's most fascinating car museum			1
the museum lies in the @entity42 provincial town of @entity43 , a three - hour ride from @entity45 by @entity42 's fast tgv trains -- or , if it was possible to drive the full 480 kilometers at the car 's top speed , just over an hour in a @entity49			1
known as the @entity51 , or the @entity52 € ” @entity51 , it 's certainly the biggest @entity31 collection in the world			1
among the vehicles is the absolute must - see of the @entity43 collection : bugatti founder @entity59 's personal car , the fabulous 1929 @entity60			1
this imposing 6.4 - meter , 3 - ton black and blue chauffeur coupe has a massive 14.7 - liter engine that produced 300 horsepower and could propel the car to 200 kilometers an hour ( 124 mph )			0
it has an equally imposing value -- somewhere north of $ 15 million , based on past sales of other @entity68			0
@entity59 's challenge to @entity70 and @entity71 @entity59 's son , @entity72 , who was killed in 1939 at the age of 30 while testing a @entity31 race car , designed the @entity75 , while the silver elephant mascot that graces its long bonnet was sculpted by @entity59 's younger brother @entity78			1
@entity79 - born @entity59 conceived the @entity80 as a vehicle that would supplant @entity71 and @entity70 as the choice of @entity84 royalty			2
his dream foundered when the @entity86 killed the market for super-expensive luxury limousines			0
in the end only six @entity68 were built by @entity31 between 1929 and 1933 -- hence their astronomical value today			1
the museum has two examples , the @entity75 and the @entity93 , plus a 1990 replica known as the @entity95			0
of the other four @entity68 , one is with the @entity97 -- which now owns the @entity31 brand , a couple are with @entity101 museums and one is in private hands			2
a 1988 replica of the @entity75 sits in the @entity105 in @entity106			0
while @entity51 is known as a @entity31 heaven , it caters to other interests			1
the current collection of 430 - plus vehicles includes early @entity42 examples of the horseless carriage ( @entity114 and @entity115 ) through to early high - end limousines such as @entity117 and @entity118 and classic prewar sports coupes such as the @entity121 @entity120			1
an oddity is the 1942 @entity124 - designed aluminum and @entity126 bubble car known as " @entity127			0
" the postwar sports car lineup includes @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and an exceptional 1955 gullwing @entity133 that was one of @entity137 's drive cars			1
a section of the @entity43 collection is devoted to a full grid of @entity142 racing cars , including the rear - engine @entity31 racer that made its debut at the @entity146			1
naturally , there 's also a modern @entity49 , housed in its own room			0
secret treasure trove still , pride of place goes to the @entity152 , which @entity59 used as his personal car until the family 's financial difficulties forced his daughter @entity156 to sell it in 1963			1
the ultimate buyers were the @entity21 brothers			2
just how the @entity159 acquired their massive collection of @entity161 and other cars is a story of obsession , deception and loss that puts ordinary midlife crises to shame			2
using money from their textile business , former @entity31 racer @entity22 snapped up every model of the car that came on the market , including in 1963 a 30 - car collection from the @entity101 auto enthusiast @entity176 that included a second royale			1
by the late 1960s , @entity22 decided he would put his secret treasure trove on public display			2
over the next decade he began restoring and preparing the vehicles for showing			0
then economic circumstances turned against the @entity159 as the @entity84 textile business began to decline in the face of cheaper @entity185 products			0
having spent so much of their revenues on motoring masterpieces , their business began to falter			0
encumbered by debt , the @entity21 brothers sought exile in @entity193 , where they remained until they died -- hans in 1989 , followed by @entity22 in 1992			1
the @entity159 ' workers put the vehicles on show between 1977 - 79 , until the @entity42 government made the collection a listed monument , ensuring it would n't be broken up or taken abroad			2
a consortium that included the local municipal authority was created to run the collection and in 1982 the museum officially opened			0
by court order , the words " @entity51 " were added to its name in 1989 , in honor of the men whose hunger for horsepower may never be surpassed			2
