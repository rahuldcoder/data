-- @entity4 will leave @entity5 at the end of the season , the nine - time @entity3 champion 's president @entity1 announced at a news conference on monday			1
by his own admission @entity4 , who won one @entity10 crown and a @entity11 with @entity5 after taking charge in 2010 , has endured what he has called his " worst season " in management			1
" the club and manager agree that the timing is right to bring the relationship to an end , " said @entity1			1
" on behalf of the board of directors , i would like to thank @entity4 for all his hard work over the last three years			0
" @entity4 will stay on for @entity5 's remaining league fixtures , with an away trip to @entity25 on may 26 and a final home game at the @entity27 on june 1 against @entity28			1
@entity5 will finish second in @entity10 this year , trailing champions @entity29 by 12 points after 36 rounds			0
the parting of ways comes three days after @entity4 was sent off as @entity5 lost the @entity11 final 2 - 1 to @entity34 , a first defeat by their neighbors in 14 years			1
real president @entity1 explained that the decision was a " mutual agreement " , so paving the way for @entity4 to make a return to @entity41 's @entity40			1
" i know in @entity41 i am loved , " said the @entity43 last month			0
" i know i am loved by some clubs , especially one			0
" the 50 - year - old has been heavily linked with a return to former club @entity47 , where he won two @entity40 titles and one @entity50 between 2004 and 2007			2
this year 's @entity52 champions will be without a coach on june 1 , with the contract for interim manager @entity55 expiring at the end of may			0
the decision to part ways via " mutual agreement " means neither @entity5 nor @entity4 will have to pay one another millions of dollars in compensation had either of them broken the terms of their contract			1
after winning @entity10 last year , @entity4 had signed a new four - year deal with the @entity66			0
the compensation package was believed to be a potential obstacle to his return to @entity70 , where @entity47 owner @entity71 paid @entity4 and his coaching staff some $ 27 million after his contract ended early in 2007			2
@entity75 coach @entity74 , who formerly led @entity47 himself , is rumored to be @entity4 's replacement			1
on monday , @entity1 denied that any deal has been agreed to replace the former @entity79 and @entity80 manager			0
" we have no pre-contract signed with any managerial candidate , " he said			0
" it 's something we 'll have to look at in the coming days			0
" @entity74 confirmed on sunday that he had asked to leave the @entity86 champions , while the club 's @entity88 owners suggested he already had an agreement in place with @entity5			1
desperate to be crowned champions of @entity94 for a record tenth time , with their last success dating back to 2002 , @entity5 turned to @entity4 just days after he lifted the @entity97 with @entity79 , ending a barren 35 - year run for the @entity99			2
yet the @entity43 was beaten in the semifinals of the competition each year with @entity5 , who were knocked out by @entity103 last month			0
without a trophy in the two years prior to his arrival , @entity4 did at least return silverware to the club - winning the @entity11 in his first season in charge			2
in 2012 , he guided @entity5 to their first league crown in four years and amassed a record tally of 100 points along the way , so eclipsing the previous best held by great rivals @entity29			0
a new deal soon followed but matters soured this season as @entity4 clashed with several star players , notably goalkeeper @entity118 -- who was demoted from the first team in recent months -- @entity120 and @entity121			2
during his 176 games in charge , @entity4 has led @entity5 to 127 victories - losing just 22 games along the way .			1
