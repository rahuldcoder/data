@entity0 -- @entity2 had been waiting for this moment for a long time			1
" i got ta tell you , " he said to the 76,000 - strong crowd , " i 've been trying to do this for 50 years			0
" for the finale of his headline slot in @entity0 's @entity10 on saturday , he 'd arranged a very special treat : an onstage collaboration with @entity14 legend @entity13			1
but the rock megastar had n't banked on the local @entity0 council deciding to show him who was boss			1
at the climax of his three - hour set , @entity2 and @entity13 , backed by the @entity21 and @entity23 guitarist @entity22 , played a storming rendition of " @entity25 " to a rapturous crowd			1
@entity2 's delight was palpable : he grinned throughout , his face lit up like a child with a super-sized @entity31 gift			2
the supergroup then segued into a sizzling version of " @entity34 " -- but as the night peaked against a backdrop of fireworks , a drably dressed man with sensible hair could be seen waving frantically at the back of the stage , indicating the rock legends ' time was drawing to a close			0
then , at 10:40 p.m. local time , as @entity2 and @entity13 were winding up the extended " @entity34 , " the sound suddenly dampened , and went quiet			1
at first , the boss did n't seem to notice			0
he attempted to address the crowd , apparently unaware that they could n't hear him			0
but as it became clear that there was no amplification , he and lead guitarist @entity50 played what looked to be a brief a cappella goodnight for the benefit of the front rows , shrugged , and left the stage			1
@entity50 tweeted later , " i 'm sorry but i have to be honest i 'm pissed ... it did n't ruin the great night			2
but when i 'm jamming with @entity13 do n't bug me ! " he also implied his fans were denied their final number , saying , " we would have been off by 11 if we 'd done one more			1
" @entity0 's @entity62 confirmed that concert organizers @entity64 had cut the power , saying they " were sticking to their license for the event			1
" according to the @entity64 website , @entity2 had been due to finish his set at 10:15 p.m. but @entity50 tweeted , " @entity64 would have let us play all night , " adding , " feel bad for our great fans ... it 's some @entity74 stupid rule			2
" audience reaction from @entity1 reporter on the scene conditions for holding concerts in @entity0 's biggest central park have been tightened in the past year , the @entity81 reported , due to a rise in complaints from local residents			2
the conservative - run council received 130 complaints about popular music events in the park in 2011			0
the events , which bring vital funding to the parks management , have been cut in number from 13 to nine and crowd size has been reduced from 80,000 to 65,000 maximum			0
campaigners in the well - heeled borough have also sought a reduction in permitted noise levels			0
a spokesman for concert operator @entity100 said : " it was unfortunate that the three hour plus performance by @entity2 was stopped right at the very end but the curfew is laid down by the authorities in the interest of the public 's health and safety			2
road closures around @entity10 are put in place at specific times to make sure everyone can exit the area safely			0
" properties around @entity10 are some of the most desirable in @entity0 , and popular with bankers , foreign investors and politicians			2
@entity2 is known for his marathon sets			0
this night was no different			0
he 'd come on stage at 7:30 p.m. and played without breaks for just over three hours , from a beautiful acoustic " @entity127 " through an extensive list that included " badlands , " " @entity124 , " " @entity125 " and " @entity126			0
" he then hit his high - energy closing set of " born in the @entity131 , " " @entity130 , " " @entity129 " and " @entity132 " before bringing on the former @entity14 for the finale			0
but that was n't enough to satisfy his fans , who were left baffled , then angry that their idol 's set had been cut short			1
" ashamed to be @entity138 right now			0
@entity2 and @entity13 playing ' @entity34 ' in @entity10 and council pulled the plug cos of curfew , " tweeted actor and comedian @entity139			1
@entity138 journalist @entity144 tweeted , " @entity145 : only in @entity138 could a local council pull the plug on the greatest artists of the last 50 years giving it all			1
" fan @entity150 demanded the concert organizers apologize for cutting @entity2 and @entity13 off mid-song , saying " wo n't come again			1

@entity2 and @entity13 have sound cut off at @entity0 *festival*
fans left angry and *disappointed* as rock idols are forced to cut set short
concert organizers pull the plug in line with local council 's strict curfew
