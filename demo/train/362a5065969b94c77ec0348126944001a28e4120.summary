-- right - wing @entity2 @entity1 are up in arms over @entity4 again			1
their ostensible cause for concern is last week 's visit to the island by @entity9 and @entity10 , who were photographed in @entity11 , apparently celebrating their wedding anniversary			1
read more : lawmakers ask why @entity9 and @entity10 went to @entity4 these blinkered conservatives need to get over themselves			1
the 60 - year stand - off between the @entity2 and @entity4 is absurd			1
it is counterproductive and harmful to both countries			0
it is time to end this @entity21 anachronism , kiss and make up			0
anger over @entity9 's supposed breach of the @entity2 embargo rules restricting @entity27 citizens ' travel to @entity4 is symbolic of a deeper fear among right - wingers			1
two key factors have changed since the days -- not so long ago -- when @entity31 seemed to be regularly threatening the @entity33 government with @entity35 - style overthrow			0
one is that @entity36 has been replaced by a @entity37			0
as @entity39 enters his second and final term , immune to electoral imperatives , conservatives worry he may use his freedom of action to effect an historic rapprochement with @entity4			2
@entity27 liberals certainly believe he should do so			2
the second change is in @entity4 itself , where the government , now led by @entity33 's brother , @entity49 , has embarked on a cautious program of reform			1
the government -- dubbed the world 's longest - running dictatorship by the @entity27 right -- has even set a date for its own dissolution			1
doing what " dictators " rarely do , @entity58 announced in february that in 2018 , he would hand over power and that any successor would be subject to term limits			0
the @entity33 brothers have reportedly chosen a career communist , first vice president @entity66 , to succeed them			0
but in reality , once their grip on power is relaxed , anything may happen			0
the two @entity71 republicans who have been making a fuss about the @entity9 visit are @entity74 and @entity75			2
they are veterans , and beneficiaries , of the @entity78 campaign that has long been waged from @entity11 , in @entity79 , the home to the state 's large @entity81 exile population			0
the @entity81 vote , as it is known , has traditionally gone to @entity1			0
but @entity39 's approach is the antithesis of the politics of hate and division			0
he broke that mold last year , making big gains among the @entity81 @entity27 electorate			2
this result suggested the polarized ethnically - based politics of the past may be breaking down , said @entity95 of the @entity2 @entity96 in a recent article in @entity98			2
" having won nearly half of the @entity81 @entity27 vote in @entity71 in 2012 , a gain of 15 percentage points over 2008 , @entity39 can move quickly on @entity4			1
if he were to do so , he would find a cautious but willing partner in @entity58 , who needs rapprochement with @entity31 to advance his own reform agenda , " @entity95 said			0
little wonder republicans like @entity74 are worried			0
if things go on like this , they could lose a large piece of their political raison d'etre			0
there are other reasons for believing the time is right for @entity39 to end the @entity4 stalemate			2
the recent death of @entity117 , @entity118 's influential president , has robbed @entity11 of a strong supporter , both political and financial			0
@entity117 was not interested in a rapprochement with the @entity2 , either by @entity4 or @entity118			1
his revolutionary beliefs did not allow for an accommodation with the @entity27 " imperialists			2
" his successors may not take so militant a line , especially given that @entity118 continues to trade heavily with the @entity2 , a privilege not allowed @entity4			1
the so - called " pink tide " that has brought several left - wing leaders to power in @entity27 in the past decade is not exactly on the ebb , but the hostility countries such as @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 felt towards the @entity36 administration has abated			1
in fact , according to @entity95 's article , @entity2 business with @entity27 as a whole is booming , up 20 % in 2011			1
the @entity2 imports more crude oil from @entity118 and @entity142 than from the @entity143 , including @entity144			0
the @entity2 does three times more business with @entity27 than with @entity146			1
the stand - off over @entity4 is an obstacle to advancing @entity2 interests and business in @entity27 countries , and vice versa			1
the continuation of the embargo has left the @entity2 almost totally isolated at the @entity155 , and at sharp odds with its major allies , including @entity158 and the @entity159			2
but more importantly , the continued ostracism of @entity4 's people -- for they , not the @entity11 government , are the biggest losers -- is unfair , unkind and unnecessary			1
if the @entity2 wants full democracy in @entity4 , then it should open up fully to ordinary @entity4			1
tear down the artificial walls that separate the people of the two countries and , as @entity169 once said , let a hundred flowers bloom			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173			0

@entity9 and @entity10 were seen in @entity4 last week , apparently celebrating their anniversary
a @entity2 embargo restricts @entity27 citizens ' right to visit @entity4
@entity173 argues the 60 - year stand - off between @entity4 and the @entity2 harms both countries
the ostracism of @entity4 's people is unfair , unkind and unnecessary , he says
