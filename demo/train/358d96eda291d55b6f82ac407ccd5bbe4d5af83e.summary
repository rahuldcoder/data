-- almost 70 years after the @entity4 military dropped an atomic bomb on the @entity7 city of @entity8 , effectively ending @entity9 , the site of the devastation remains one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country			1
and it appears to be getting more popular			0
according to a recent report in the @entity15 , visits to the @entity16 by foreign tourists hit a record high of 200,086 in 2013			1
local officials confirm that the memorial site is attracting an increasing number of tourists to study the burnt wreckage , painful witness testimonies and human shadows left permanently visible after the atomic bomb explosion 's incandescent destruction			1
a number of factors lay behind the site 's continuing hold on travelers			1
some people describe @entity8 as a gripping , educational and emotional example of " dark tourism , " " grief tourism " or " battlefield tourism , " which includes @entity40 concentration camps in @entity41 , @entity43 's torture prison and killing fields , @entity46 slave ports and @entity48 's 9/11 crater			2
most tourists gaze in mute awe at @entity8 's atomic bomb @entity51 , which became a @entity53 in 1996			1
the now - iconic structure , designed in 1915 by a @entity56 architect , was the city 's @entity57			2
when the @entity4 dropped the bomb on august 6 , 1945 , it exploded just above the building , but did n't totally destroy it because the immediate blast and heat buffered the air at ground zero			0
@entity67 calls @entity68 a top @entity7 attraction about 363,000 tourists visited @entity8 during 2012 , according the most recent statistics			1
@entity4 comprise the largest number , followed by @entity73 and @entity74 , according to statistics for the city and surrounding prefecture			2
" the name ' @entity8 ' has been well - known among foreign countries from its history , and recently word - of - mouth effect from visitors adds more reality to it , " @entity79 representative @entity78 told @entity0 in an e-mail			2
" in recent years , word - of - mouth information from @entity88 and so on also has a strong influence			0
" for example , the @entity16 ranked number one ... for the ranking of ' the most popular tourist spots in @entity7 for foreign tourists ' at the travel website @entity67 two years in a row			1
" the @entity16 and @entity51 appeared at the top of a 2012 @entity67 list of @entity99 in @entity7			1
the @entity100 ranks number - two ( behind the " shrine island " of @entity104 , also in @entity102 ) on the site 's current list of @entity107 - see attractions in @entity7 awarded by @entity109			1
nightmarish displays the atomic bomb was dropped over @entity8 from an @entity4 b - 29 bomber			0
the explosion obliterated nearly everything within 10 - square kilometers ( six square miles ) in the downtown area , killing 60,000 to 80,000 people			2
radiation poisoning eventually sickened others , resulting in an estimated final total death toll of 135,000 people			0
across the @entity121 , which flows in front of the @entity51 , the @entity16 displays evocative exhibits , including a blistered and fused tricycle that a four - year - old boy was riding during the blast that burned him to death			1
photos and documentary films , nightmarish drawings by survivors , scientific explanations of the explosion , plus other artifacts including melted glass and charred clothing , hint at the unimaginable			1
" this museum was established by the city of @entity8 to convey the reality of the atomic bombing to the world , and contribute to the total abolition of nuclear weapons , and realization of lasting world peace , " @entity16 director @entity138 told @entity0 in an e-mail			1
the museum 's growing popularity among tourists is due in part to " the weaker yen and various tourism - promoting activities conducted by the national and local government , " @entity138 said			1
" we also consider the high reputation of @entity67 , which attracts a lot of foreign visitors , as one of the biggest reasons " that more travelers arrive each year , he said			1
from devastation to hope the concept of " peace " is one of @entity8 's biggest attractions			2
" @entity8 has achieved a remarkable recovery from that devastation , although the first atomic bomb in history was dropped on @entity8 in 1945 , and has pursued everlasting world peace for mankind , " said @entity169 of the @entity79			0
" visitors say they feel its most powerful message , that of hope , and appreciate anew the importance of peace , " he said			0
" the impression of @entity8 that visitors take away seems to be affected by whether they have had the opportunity to meet and communicate with local people , " @entity169 said			0
@entity186 , 45 , an @entity187 instructor from @entity188 , has visited the @entity100 , @entity51 and related sites during repeat trips to @entity8			2
" my strongest memory is of the watches that stopped at the moment the bomb detonated , " he said			0
" the burnt metal lunch boxes of the young students with the petrified rice still inside is a quiet , jaw - dropping sight			0
" i do n't know what it is , but i can feel and sense it when i am there			0
the tales of survivors with photographs are striking and even shocking to a degree			0
" i could n't help think of my grandfather and what he would have been doing in @entity188 at the same time there was such tragic destruction , " said @entity186 , who has also visited the second atomic bomb blast memorial in @entity207			0
making the bombing ' real ' for new generations " i visited @entity8 in july 1998 , during my first visit to @entity7 , " said @entity214 , 34 , an @entity4 graphic designer who teaches @entity187 in @entity207			1
" my student group went to the @entity100 , the @entity68 and the @entity217			0
we saw the [ origami ] paper cranes while there			0
" it made the bombing more of a reality for me and my fellow high school students			0
only reading about it in textbooks , and seeing footage on tv , made the event seem abstract and remote			0
" it was profound to see artifacts such as a mangled , charred tricycle , as well as people 's shadows burned into concrete from the blast , " @entity214 said			2
difficult history debate about whether or not the @entity4 should have dropped the bombs on @entity242 continues to swirl			0
" i 'm against the fact that @entity7 was bombed , of course , but at the same time , the war kept going in a nasty direction and neither @entity7 nor the @entity4 was backing down , " said @entity214			1
" @entity8 's memorial is " not a fun thing to do on one 's vacation , obviously , but it is an important experience that people can learn a lot from , " he added			2
some remain reluctant to visit the site			0
" if i do have the chance , i do n't know if i will make a visit or not , " said @entity257 , 43 , a @entity259 - based @entity7 publisher and translator			1
" i should go as a @entity7 citizen , taking my daughter with me			1
honestly speaking , i feel very reluctant to go , as i know that it will be a tough experience for me , " she said			0
today , @entity7 's @entity266 describes @entity8 's atomic bomb site simply as , " negative cultural heritage that tells of the mistakes humanity has made			1
