there were reports that in one village , " all women might have been systematically raped , " he said			1
@entity8 had gone to @entity6 to find out why peacekeepers said they had n't learned about the rapes near @entity26 sooner			1

the @entity2 initially said it did not learn about the attacks until august 12 , when it was alerted by @entity90			2
that group said it first told the @entity2 about the rapes on august 6			2
but on tuesday , the @entity2 acknowledged that it first learned of a report of rape on july 30 , nearly two weeks earlier than it had previously said			1
" we can confirm that the @entity99 from @entity76 on 30 july included the following : ' today 30 july 2010 during morning hours , the locality of @entity96 ( 52 km e of @entity97 ) passed under control of @entity42 [ @entity42 ] combatants			2

@entity2 officials have said they will toughen efforts to stop rapes in the region			2
" the women of eastern @entity6 deserve better , " said @entity125 , a @entity2 special representative for sexual violence in conflict who sent a senior member of her staff with @entity8 on his fact - finding mission to the region			1
" for them , there is no safe place			0
they are raped when harvesting crops ; when going to market ; when fetching water and firewood ; when carrying their babies ; when in their homes at night , among their loved ones			0
" she added that the rape is becoming a weapon of choice in eastern @entity6			1
" the sad reality is that incidents of rape have become so commonplace that they do not trigger our most urgent interventions , " she said			0
noting that the information about the rapes " was slow to surface , " she called for the @entity2 to focus on how to improve its response to such reports			1
" we should examine the @entity2 's response , including that of our peacekeepers on the ground , not in a spirit of self - recrimination but with a determination and resolve to do better to protect civilians in what is undoubtedly one of the most complex , vast and volatile conflict zones in the world			2
" she noted that some rebel leaders have been identified as having been present during the attacks and called for them to be used " as a starting point " to bring the attackers to justice			0
" our policies of ' zero tolerance ' can not be backed by a reality of ' zero consequences , ' " she said .			0
