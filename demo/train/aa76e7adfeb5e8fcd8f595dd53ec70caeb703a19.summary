-- the resignation of @entity2 as @entity4 's prime minister does not mark his end , but @entity6			1
he will not disappear from the stage anytime soon			0
through his vast public and private sector networks , @entity2 's influence on @entity10 affairs will continue for the foreseeable future and beyond			1
however , despite making several successful comebacks , any further attempt will be far less effective			0
while @entity2 's credibility abroad is irreparably damaged , his legitimacy at home consistently sags			1
as a rapidly aging figure , he is increasingly disconnected from political reality			2
time is of the essence and necessity determines a technocratic government that must last until 2013 , when elections are formally due			2
during this period , @entity4 's problems will not be resolved			1
the objectives must be to stabilize the status quo , place @entity4 on a clear path to reform and provide a respectable degree of certainty for international markets			2
@entity20 has run out for @entity4 to determine the process and pace of reform			2
past failures have caught up			0
greater collective sacrifices are now required			0
a new government must firmly make the often unpopular decisions required			0
the crucial need for structural reform and greater deregulation is accompanied by the need to boost competitiveness and growth -- indispensable elements to long - term success			0
while @entity4 's long - standing challenges remain unresolved , the deep level of political polarization continues , as does @entity4 's failure to adapt to an increasingly globalized world			1
with one of the world 's lowest birth rates , @entity4 is increasingly becoming a nation of pensioners , ruled by pensioners for the sake of pensioners			1
it amounts to a gerontocracy with little , if any , meritocracy			0
in @entity4 , a young leader is considered someone in his 50s			2
the prevailing perception of politicians is that their purpose is not to serve the public but to take from it and distribute the spoils to loyalists in order to guarantee survival and self - preservation			0
for young @entity10 , upward mobility is not a fluid process			2
personal connections or tutelage under a " sponsor " becomes a more secure guarantee to success			0
some of @entity4 's best and brightest opt for opportunities abroad to find greater meritocracy and equitable results for hard work			1
in the corporate realm , many of @entity4 's largest multinationals have adapted to globalization			1
however , many small and medium - sized companies , largely responsible for the nation 's post-war economic success , struggle to compete			1
for a society which has enjoyed generous state - sponsored benefits for decades , amending or revoking what is considered an entitlement will be extremely difficult			0
this requires not only an economic change but a cultural one in a country where dependence upon the state prevails in many quarters and remains significantly rooted in the political culture			0
as the world 's eighth largest economy , @entity10 consistently punches below its weight			1
by continuing on its present course , and as new powers emerge globally , @entity4 will inevitably be relegated			2
its traditional political establishment pales in competence when compared to its entrepreneurial class			1
@entity4 remains a nation unable to unleash its wealth of talent , much of which continues to seek opportunities abroad , significantly hurting the nation 's competitiveness and growth			1
@entity4 possesses one of the most over-regulated economies and some of the lowest labor productivity rates in the developed world			2
@entity127 and pension reform and deregulation remain essential priorities			0
excessively powerful unions continue to exercise disproportionate influence over effective national policy			2
corruption and organized crime in @entity4 's southern regions continue to hinder economic development			1
as for @entity4 , the door now opens for a potential realignment in @entity10 politics			1
a sizable centrist bloc could emerge as a power broker in determining future governments			0
it would be a combination of old @entity145 , defectors from @entity2 's party and disenchanted centrist elements of the main center - left party , @entity150			1
while @entity2 's center - right will attempt to consolidate its ranks , the center - left will struggle to overcome divisions			1
throughout the turmoil of recent months , @entity4 's center - left has utterly failed to seize the political initiative			1
in part , this has helped to extend @entity2 's survival			1
in retrospect , @entity2 had an historic opportunity to reform @entity4 , particularly after winning an absolute parliamentary majority in 2008			1
it was squandered due largely to his personal shortcomings and inability to effectively manage @entity4 's economy and political system			1
his failures led to his ouster and history will deny him the chance to ever make up for it			0
during his 20 - year political career , @entity2 displayed impeccable endurance skills			2
at home , he survived more than 50 confidence votes , scandals , court cases and other controversies , all somewhat subject to his influence			0
however , current market pressure proved too overwhelming for @entity2 's aura of invincibility and omnipotence			1
ironically , his most humiliating defeat was largely inflicted by external circumstances beyond his control			0
in less than 48 hours , he became the second victim of the eurozone crisis after the resignation of the @entity190 prime minister			0
a possible third target is @entity193 's @entity192 after national elections on november 20			0
over time , @entity2 has largely become the victim of his own hubris			1
whereas many @entity10 were amused by past antics , they eventually became a liability and particularly unacceptable for the important voting bloc of @entity2 's @entity202 supporters			1
his can - do - no - wrong attitude also became unsustainable			0
the sense that he was accountable to no - one but himself created resentment even among diehard loyalists			0
this was further compounded by the perception of a do - nothing , no - results government			0
from @entity2 's perspective , he was back - stabbed			1
after all , the narrative goes , he saved @entity4 from the far left and is therefore entitled to rule at will and leave power when ready			2
to think otherwise is committing treason			0
many are eager to write off @entity2 sooner rather than later			2
some are ideologically driven , others simply tired of polemics and political gridlock			0
it may be too premature to write his political obituary just yet			0
however , the drafting has begun in earnest			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225			2

@entity225 : @entity2 's influence on @entity10 affairs will continue for foreseeable future
