-- there 's a special form of loathing reserved for a building that forces you to remove your shoes , wait in line , get groped , shell out for bad food and dash in a panic to an arbitrarily changed gate before canceling your flight			2
but let 's be clear			2
the most hated airports in the world are not the worst airports in the world			1
for that you 'll have to consult @entity20 or fly to destinations the majority of us have little need to pin on a map or pronounce properly			2
read more on @entity0 : 10 of the world 's most loved airports to come up with our admittedly unscientific list , we canvassed travel websites , blogs and message boards			2
and called on memories of our own travel nightmares			2
what follow are majorly despised international hubs ( or hopefuls ) that , while they may have a few staunch fans , and some have even won awards , have all inspired enough fury , flak and " never again " air - rage to merit a place on this list			1
got your own airport - rage story ? leave a comment below or tell us about it in an @entity52 -- the best submissions will feature on @entity0			1
you can also vote for your most awful airport on our @entity57 poll			2
@entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 why is this place on our list after scoring third best airport in @entity64 at the 2011 @entity65 ? because , shockingly enough , it turns out that corporate medal ceremonies are n't always in sync with what people are thinking when they 're standing in two - hour immigration lines , suffering routinely unannounced gate changes and paying through the teeth for a stale @entity60 cheese roll and beer inside an understaffed and over-aged aviation facility			2
in a country where flight delays ( departing or arriving ) are just part of the deal , some recent numbers would give pause to the most unflappable traveler at @entity60 's largest airport			1
just 41 percent of all flights leave on time			1
only 59 percent of flights arrive on schedule , according to @entity89			1
@entity90 has announced plans to add runways and terminals -- what airport has n't ? -- but with nearly 30 million passengers traipsing through every year ( the figure has reportedly doubled in under a decade ) the urgency is palpable and , sadly enough , unsolved by upping prices at musty duty - free shops			2
but does this really constitute bronze medal status ? when the best unofficial advice for surviving @entity60 's pin - up airport is to try and learn a little @entity105 and not lose your temper , something 's got ta give			2

@entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 if there 's one thing @entity116 love , it 's hating their airports			0
but while the big guns in @entity120 , @entity121 and also - rans in @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 get routinely lambasted for various inefficiencies and rip - off tactics , passengers in @entity112 have a special place in their spleens for @entity111			0
" the only advantage over some other airports is the lack of nearby combat , " notes one of several miffed passengers on @entity131			0
with a reviled pair of domestic terminals ( home of two - hour taxi - line queues , atrocious check - in lines , overpopulated gates and meager lounges ) and a slightly more palatable international terminal five kilometers away , @entity111 's brittle facilities can be overwhelmed just by a trio of aircraft arriving within 20 minutes of each other			1
now that an ambitious " billion - dollar " redevelopment project has been significantly scaled back , who would ever want to leave @entity150 for this place ? read more on @entity0 : transit hotels : how to get to sleep during your stopover 8			1
@entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 for a small airport in a pretty country , @entity159 has it all : the interminable weather delays of @entity164 , the shoddy restroom maintenance of a @entity167 sports bar , the departure board sparsity of @entity169 and the chronic chaos of a kids ' soccer match			1
some airport improvements have been underway for the @entity158 2011 tourism campaign , including things most passengers do n't much care about ( e.g. , the new helicopter base )			0
the most serious beefs with @entity158 's only international airport revolve around its primitive yet officious check - in procedure , starring a roulette wheel of underpaid security agents			1
" departure is an endless game of body searches and silly questions , " notes one passenger			0
" those who did n't have their e-tickets printed out had to argue their way in , " says another , who was checked seven times and scolded for not having a baggage tag on a carry - on before eventually boarding			1
the city 's markets and surrounding mountains are lovely			0
@entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 you 'd think it would be one of the greatest humiliations any major airport would never allow itself to live down -- getting routinely abandoned by fed - up folks opting to fly out of @entity208 ( @entity208 ! ) instead , where at least the ground staff cop less attitude and fewer people outside are pretending to be cab drivers			0
but , nah , @entity199 really could n't care less			0
every year , more than 21 million passengers stumble through worn , mid-century terminals that peaked when @entity215 arrived in the @entity201 and rooftop parking was all the rage ; @entity199 proudly remains the world 's busiest international air gateway			1
so if you 're not into a dim , surly , unbearably congested airport reeking with attitude and unapologetically long immigration lines -- good riddance			0
" @entity199 had a piece of my luggage sitting in a little detention room for bags -- for over a year , " notes one passenger			0
" no one noticed it was there , until finally an observant @entity233 employee wondered what the dusty little green bag in the corner was			0

@entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 " as @entity247 airports go , it 's not that bad -- but as an international hub , it may be one of the worst out there			1
" this is the common refrain among travelers through @entity242 , who either do n't have the heart or the expectations to give this dated aviation facility the kind of pounding reserved for the @entity257 and @entity258 of the world			1
saddled with a 1958 blueprint designed for 2.5 million passengers , @entity242 receives close to twice that many			1
hence the airport 's 2005 , three phase , us $ 100 million expansion project which has seen long delays ( something about the rain ) and has been spinning its tires somewhere in phase two for the last few years			0
for now , that means business as usual : cramped spaces ; long lines ; inadequate seating ; frequent power outages ; tiny washrooms hiding up several flights of stairs ; shabby duty free shops ; overpriced food outlets ; and business class lounges worthy of a shelter in mid-city @entity283			1
sure , it 's a breeze compared to @entity285			0
but it could be so much better			0
the confusing result : grateful disappointment ? see @entity0 's top five most - hated airports © 2011 @entity290 @entity291			0

at @entity294 , only 41 percent of flights leave on time
print out your e-ticket before arriving at @entity156 in @entity157 or you may have to argue your way in
while @entity242 in @entity243 is decent for @entity247 , it is one of the worst international hubs
