-- in his speech tuesday night , president @entity1 hammered @entity4 leader @entity3 for his alleged use of chemical weapons , made the case for a military intervention , and then said he 'll let diplomacy play out -- for now			1
the assertions @entity1 made were n't new ones			1
both he and the @entity12 have said them before			0
the difference ? a majority of @entity16 who watched the prime time address said they favor the approach he spelled out			2
here are the five broad themes from the speech , and the counterpoints that opponents of his approach have made			0
what 's next on @entity1 's to - do list point intervening is in the @entity16 ' national security interest			1
the president said chemical weapons in @entity4 are a future threat to the @entity16 and its allies			1
what 's more , they flout international law			0
" this is not a world we should accept , " @entity1 said			2
" this is what 's at stake			0
" @entity47 no it 's not			0
former @entity16 sen. @entity49 says there 's no reason for @entity16 involvement			1
" the bottom line here is we have no national security interest , " the 2012 @entity54 presidential candidate told @entity0			0
" we have no moral obligation to use military force when it comes to a humanitarian situation			0
" --- point @entity64 must be held accountable			1
the president is playing up the two ds of a military strike : degrading and deterring			1
" even a limited strike will send a message to @entity3 that no other nation can deliver , " the president argues			1
" a targeted strike can make @entity3 , or any other dictator , think twice before using chemical weapons			1
" @entity47 ok , but at what cost ? a @entity16 strike could lead to a regional conflict , a weakened @entity4 regime , and strengthened opposition forces made up of multiple terrorist factions who could hurt the @entity16 , said @entity83 rep. @entity82 of @entity84			1
" would it not be potentially irresponsible to take action against @entity4 just for the sake of saying we took action against @entity4 , when that action could lead to something far worse ? " she told @entity0			2
--- point a @entity16 military action would be limited			1
@entity1 said @entity4 is not @entity93 , or @entity94 for that matter			1
" i will not put @entity16 boots on the ground in @entity4 , " the president said			1
" this would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective , deterring the use of chemical weapons and degrading @entity3 's capabilities			1
" @entity47 there 's no way to promise that			0
@entity108 sen. @entity107 , who sits on the @entity109 , put it simply : " there is no guarantee			0
" the @entity113 estimates it would take 75,000 troops to secure @entity4 's chemical weapons stockpiles			2
it 's not up to @entity16 forces , of course , but someone will have to do it			2
--- point diplomatic avenues must be pursued first			0
the president made it clear : he prefers a peaceful solution			0
he did win the @entity125 after all			0
@entity128 's diplomatic offer -- that @entity4 says it has accepted -- has @entity126 putting its chemical weapons under international control			1
the potential is promising enough that @entity1 asked @entity132 to postpone a vote on military action			2
he said the @entity16 will work with the @entity135 on a resolution " requiring @entity3 to give up his chemical weapons , and to ultimately destroy them under international control			1
" @entity47 this is just a @entity4 stalling tactic			2
the opposition @entity139 , echoing widespread skepticism , says @entity3 is n't serious			2
" here we go again with the regime trying to buy more time in order to keep on the daily slaughter against our innocent civilians and to fool the world , " said @entity141 , a spokesman for the group			0
more than 100,000 people have died in @entity4 during its civil war			0
--- point the @entity16 has moral responsibility			0
the president called the @entity16 " the anchor of global security " for the last 70 years and then posed the question : " @entity16 sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas and we choose to look the other way ? " @entity47 the @entity16 ca n't play global cop			1
the president agrees with this point too			0
yes , it 's complicated			0
" @entity16 is not the world 's policeman			2
terrible things happen across the globe , and it is beyond our means to right every wrong			0
" but , he added , " when with modest effort and risk we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run , i believe we should act			0
" @entity1 seeks support for attacking @entity4 while pursuing diplomacy @entity0 's @entity183 also contributed to this report .			1

the president treads the line between diplomacy and a possible military strike
@entity1 says @entity4 president @entity3 's regime must be held accountable
some fear the diplomatic path is just a stall tactic
the @entity16 ca n't look the other way in @entity4 , the president says
