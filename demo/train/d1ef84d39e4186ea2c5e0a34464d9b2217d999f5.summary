-- @entity2 striker @entity1 scored his 100th @entity4 goal to help @entity5 keep their title hopes alive with a stunning 3 - 1 win at rivals @entity8			1
the in - form @entity1 , who had scored 22 goals in all competitions this season prior to the match -- including four against @entity12 last weekend -- achieved the milestone with @entity5 's second goal , a brilliant finish following a devastating counter-attack			1
@entity5 , who won by the same scoreline at the @entity19 in last year 's @entity21 semifinal , needed a victory to keep pace with @entity24 at the top of the table -- and they took a 33rd - minute lead with a moment of skill from @entity31 winger @entity30			1
@entity30 , who has failed to establish himself as a regular during his time at @entity34 , flicked the ball past @entity8 's @entity36 and @entity37 on the right wing , before producing a delicate lob that goalkeeper @entity40 could only palm into his own net			0
and @entity5 doubled their lead four minutes later when @entity30 out - stripped the @entity8 defence on the break and @entity1 -- who had started the move -- ran half the length of the pitch to be on hand in support to fire past @entity40			1
@entity8 continued to press forward looking for a way back into the match , but once again they were caught on the break as this time @entity56 @entity55 burst through a huge gap in the home defence to slide home the decisive third goal early in the second half			2
@entity5 had chances to increase their advantage with both @entity1 and @entity30 close to adding a fouth , but it was @entity8 who claimed a late consolation when @entity69 's shot found the net after taking a deflection off @entity72			1
" that was a great performance by us			0
we played really well , " @entity5 manager sir @entity75 told @entity76			0
" this is the time of the season we really need to kick on -- and it was an impressive result			0
we were sharp and incisive and could have scored more			0
" but we are still behind @entity24 and i hope that @entity8 go there and batter them next sunday ! " the result means @entity5 remain a point behind @entity24 at the top of the table , although the @entity88 side have a game in hand -- at @entity12 on tuesday			1
@entity8 are now five points behind @entity24 in third place having played a game more and , if @entity24 win in midweek , that gap will increase to eight points ahead of the two sides meeting at @entity97 next sunday			2
it proved a good day for @entity99 as @entity5 's rivals @entity12 maintained their push for a @entity21 place with a comfortable 2 - 0 home win over crisis - club @entity103			2
bottom - of - the - table @entity103 -- who agreed to sell defender @entity106 to @entity107 this weekend just so the wage bill could be paid -- went behind when @entity109 fired @entity12 ahead with his first goal since his traumatic experience with @entity112 at the @entity113 in @entity114			0
and @entity12 made the points safe on the stroke of half - time when @entity118 powered a header past goalkeeper @entity120 from @entity122 's corner .			0

@entity2 striker @entity1 scores his 100th @entity4 goal on sunday
@entity1 helps @entity5 claim a superb 3 - 1 victory at @entity4 rivals @entity8
the result keeps champions *united* just a point behind leaders @entity24 at the top of the table
