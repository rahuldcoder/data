@entity0 -- born and raised in the @entity3 to a businessman and a socialite model , @entity2 is today one of @entity0 's most celebrated fashion designers , with a clientele that includes @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , and @entity12			1
a graduate of @entity0 's @entity14 , @entity2 began designing wedding gowns while shopping for one for herself			1
she launched her first bridal collection in 1996 and today , her atelier also produces ready - to - wear evening gowns , linens and tableware , fine paper and home fragrances			2
her dresses , which sell for $ 1,500 to $ 16,000 , are stocked at @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 and , in a few months , she will open a flagship store -- her third outlet -- and a new showroom in @entity31			2
@entity2 's average day is spent convening with her design team , monitoring the progress of licensing deals and conducting fittings , overseeing pr and production , making visits to her @entity0 flagship store and her factory			1
at night , after her two children are in bed , @entity2 often attends functions too			1
here , she tells @entity1 about building a business from scratch , working with celebrities , and having a husband for a ceo			1
on early ambition ... ever since i was a little girl , i always loved fashion			1
i would watch my mother get dressed and suggest things she should wear			2
when my parents used to entertain , i would come out and perform after dinner with my little outfits that were cut up and restyled			2
i always thought i was going to be a dancer and then fashion kind of took over			1
every young girl goes through that stage , but it did n't stop			2
i would go and sketch with our local tailor in the @entity3			2
on breaking into bridal as a bride ... when i looked at what was out there , i felt that there was a lack of fashionable options for young women so i said , ' this is what i want to do : i want to start with wedding gowns '			2
i was 23 years old			1
my husband [ @entity73 ] was like ' it 's a phase			1
' we got married and six months later i came up with a small line of wedding dresses -- probably six of them			2
i went to a local trade show and had a little booth and showed my dresses and to my excitement and delight , five stores ordered pieces from me			2
we drove home and i realized that i actually had to make everything			0
on getting established ... the first year , people could barely say my name			0
they were like ' @entity90 ... that @entity2 girl			1
' then after a year or three , they were saying ' @entity93 - yay ' and i was like , ' well , something 's happening			1
' on her point of difference ... i had not worked for a storied house before , so i had to prove myself from the very beginning			0
i followed my gut and was always putting myself in the shoes of the ladies i was designing for			0
' would i want to wear that ? would i feel special in that ? would that flatter my figure ? ' since we started in bridal , i really perfected the fit			1
i think , you know , that was the key to why so many women responded to it			0
on making the old feel new ... i do three bridal collections a year , and what 's been helpful is that i do ready - to - wear in between , so when i approach bridal , i 'm ready for whites and ivories again			1
before , there was a point where i was like ' i ca n't do one more white wedding dress			0
' i 'm injecting new color			0
there 's blush : that 's so subtle , yet it 's a big commitment to go outside white and ivory			1
that 's a trend i 've been pushing for the last two seasons and now brides are embracing it			1
another trend i started five years ago was adding a sash and introducing color that way			1
on designing for celebrities ... [ it 's a ] platform for the world to see what my work looks like and they showcase it beautifully			1
they 're trendsetters and that 's such a positive -- to get that exposure			1
the downside is you do n't have all the control			0
sometimes when they put something on , they change the design a little bit to make it their own and our point of view is lost along the way			0
i love working with @entity155			0
@entity11 was a dream to work with on her wedding because she knew what she wanted and has a great sense of style			0
it was a very easy collaboration			0
on having a ceo / husband ... it 's hard to keep family life and workplace separated			1
we always say we do but we do n't			0
when you 're married to your business partner , it 's very hard			1
i always make sure his needs are met			0
we bounce ideas off of each other and he is my soul mate			0
yes , everybody needs to work on their marriage but i feel like he is really an extension of me			0
i do n't know what i would do without him			0
on work - life balance ... i realized when we were starting our company that you have to give up everything , personally , in the very beginning			0
there 's no balance at that point			1
it 's all about work			1
the first 10 years we worked almost 24 hours ( a day )			0
i mean , obviously we slept , but if we were not in the factory doing something , we were travelling , doing trunk shows , selling the collection			0
we did everything and i do n't think there 's any other way to start			1
i am a perfectionist but i know how to live life			0
when i 'm working , it 's 100 %			1
when i 'm with my friends , i put everything away and enjoy life			0
when i come home to my kids , it 's pure joy and everything 's worth it			1
every time , i really focus 100 percent on one thing			0
i 've learned how to juggle my life and i feel like now i have the perfect balance			0
on how to live a good life ... i do n't know what tomorrow brings , but right now , i 'm grateful for everything that i have			0
in the future , i 'd like to be able to give back as well			0
that 's part of how i think one 's life should be led -- start with a career , then have a beautiful family , and then it 's time to give back			2
that 's just the way the world should be			2
on delegating ... that 's the only way to grow so we 're building our team and we do delegate but we never turn off our blackberries or iphones .			2
