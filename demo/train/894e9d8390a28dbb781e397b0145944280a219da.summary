@entity0 -- attorney general @entity2 angrily responded friday to @entity4 critics of his handling of a controversial gun enforcement operation , charging them with using " irresponsible and inflammatory rhetoric			1
" " i simply can not sit idly by as a ( @entity4 ) member of the @entity12 suggests , as happened this week , that law enforcement and government employees who devote their lives to protecting our citizens be considered " accessories to murder , ' " @entity2 said in a letter to members of @entity10			1
" such irresponsible and inflammatory rhetoric must be repudiated in the strongest possible terms , " he said			1
the bitter debate follows the release this week of @entity27 documents on @entity28 that prompted @entity4 critics to charge @entity2 knew about the now - discredited @entity31 gun operation before he previously claimed in testimony before the @entity33			1
@entity2 did not mention by name anyone other than @entity33 chairman @entity36 in his stinging rebuke of the charges that have been leveled at the attorney general			1
@entity2 insisted , as his @entity27 aides have for several days , that he was not inconsistent in his testimony			2
" my testimony was truthful and accurate , " @entity2 said			2
" i have no recollection of knowing about @entity31 or of hearing its name prior to the public controversy about it			0
prior to early 2011 , i certainly never knew about the tactics employed in the operation			0
" the tactics @entity2 referred to center on @entity51 agents allowing illegally purchased guns to " walk " from @entity54 gun stores to @entity55			1
the @entity57 plan was to track the weapons to @entity55 drug cartels			0
however , many of the guns were lost in the operation , and two of them ended up at the scene where @entity65 border patrol agent @entity31 was murdered			0
new boss at @entity67 announces major shake - up @entity2 insists that when he learned of those tactics he stopped " uncontrolled crossing of guns across the border , " and called for an inspector general investigation to get to the bottom of the matter			2
@entity76 , a spokesman for the committee chaired by @entity36 , issued a statement in response to @entity2 's letter			1
" if attorney general @entity2 had said these things five months ago when @entity10 asked him about @entity31 , it might have been more believable			0
at this point , however , it 's hard to take at face value a defense that is factually questionable , entirely self - serving , and a still incomplete account of what senior @entity27 officials knew about gun walking , " @entity76 said			1
@entity2 's five - page letter included detailed explanations in response to various points raised by his critics			2
he concluded by saying : " until we move beyond the current political climate , where real solutions take a back seat to both political posturing and making headlines on cable news programs , and is deemed more important than actually solving our country 's difficult challenges , nothing is going to change			0
i hope we can engage in a more responsible dialogue on this subject in the future			0
" @entity1 's @entity110 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 strikes back after a comment by a @entity4 member of the @entity33
" such irresponsible and inflammatory rhetoric must be repudiated , " he says
he *rejects* accusations that he knew details about a gun operation earlier than he testified
committee spokesman calls his denial " factually questionable ( and ) entirely self - serving "
