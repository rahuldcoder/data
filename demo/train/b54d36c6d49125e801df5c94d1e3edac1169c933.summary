depending who you ask , @entity3 's decision to hire @entity4 several months into her pregnancy is either a boon to all working mothers or a misstep for the ailing tech company			1
" talk about lousy timing			0
she 'll be taking maternity leave when she needs to be at work			1
@entity3 has enough problems without a part - time ceo , " one commenter said in response to the @entity17 article announcing news of her pregnancy			1
" it is quite possible that she can do both effectively , but it is not un- ' evolved ' to express concern , " another said , referring to @entity24 's comment that @entity3 's directors demonstrated " evolved thinking " in choosing to hire a pregnant chief executive			1
" as a @entity3 shareholder , i am very concerned and have every reason to be			2
" it 's possible that @entity24 anticipated these reactions when she revealed her plan to work during her maternity leave so she could " stay in the rhythm of things			1
" her announcement reignited an already hot debate over whether women can " have it all " and how family leave policies make it hard to juggle a successful career and family			1
opinion : what signal is @entity4 giving to @entity3 employees ? but @entity24 is n't your typical working mother , and some believe her experience reflects the extreme demands that corporate @entity57 places on men and women alike and how that translates to national policy			1
besides , the demands of motherhood only grow with time , author and activist @entity61 said			2
that 's when benefits such as flexible scheduling , reduced work weeks and the option to work from home really make a difference in helping women get as close as possible to having it all			1
@entity74 : how do you balance career and family ? " life only gets busier as your children grow , and that 's where flexible benefits comes in , " she said			1
" we have a long way to go as a country when it comes to making those benefits accessible to everyone			0
" ireporter @entity90 was away from work for 12 weeks after the birth of her son , @entity94			0
but that has n't made returning any easier , she said			0
having flexible hours and remote cameras in day cares would help ease the transition , she said			0
" before , i got to spend all day with my son , and now it 's only two or three hours in the evening , " the human resources manager said in an @entity74 submitted to @entity100			0
" i want more time with my little guy , but i have to take what i can get			0
... it 's hard to balance everything			2
" ' @entity108 , rich or self - employed ' that @entity24 's pregnancy is a matter of concern to some even though it was n't for @entity3 's board ( as @entity24 tells it ) reflects a double - standard , @entity61 said			1
" it 's very common for companies to negotiate time off upfront with a new hire			0
if she were a man , no one would judge her for taking time off , regardless of the reason , " said @entity61 , author of " @entity118			0
" nearly 61 % of women with children younger than 3 and 56 % of women with children younger than 1 were in the labor force in 2011 , according to @entity128 , an organization that tracks women 's advancement in the workplace , citing @entity132			2
but ambivalence over their participation in the work force seems to persist			0
a 2009 @entity138 report found that 21 % of adults said the trend toward more mothers working outside the home had been good for society ; 37 % said it had been bad and 38 % said it has n't made much difference			2
women reported feeling stressed about balancing work and family , the report said , with 40 % of working moms saying they always feel rushed compared with 24 % of the general public and 26 % of stay - at - home moms			1
as for working dads , 25 % said they always feel rushed			0
this month 's @entity156 cover story , " why women still ca n't have it all , " has stoked intense debate on the topic			2
former @entity161 official @entity160 proposes that the only women who manage to reach the pinnacle of their careers while raising a family are " superhuman , rich or self - employed			1
" @entity160 chronicles her decision to leave @entity167 and return to academia so she can play a larger role in raising her sons , using her personal journey as a jumping off point to examine the decisions and barriers women face in balancing a career with family			2
in @entity181 exchanges this week punctuated with the hashtag # havingitall , the @entity179 professor applauded @entity24 's appointment at @entity3 but noted that it seemed to prove her thesis			1
" women who are having it all are superhuman , rich , and in charge			1
i 'm all for @entity4 ! but the norm ? " she tweeted			0
her exchange with @entity193 , who tweeted " let 's hope she inspires [ corporations ] to create better options for all working moms , " underscored what feminists and policy experts have been saying for years : that corporate culture in the @entity57 , one of few industrialized nations without paid family leave for new parents , does not foster ideal conditions for work - life balance -- for women or men			1
" we live in a society where there 's very little space for men or women in corporate spheres to easily juggle family lives with professional lives , " said @entity210 , chair of the @entity211 at @entity212 in @entity213			1
" when we talk about maternity leave , we assume it 's only women who should be taking time off when a child is born			1
i think that comes from a culture where the assumption is that women are the primary caretakers and the father 's bond with his children is not as important , " @entity210 said			2
" i think we would have better familial bonds if we viewed parenting as something that every parent could participate in , not just women			0
" someone in @entity24 's position likely has the resources to enable her to work through maternity leave , but that 's certainly not the norm for most working mothers			1
if anything , her experience is representative of the rules and expectations of @entity253 of major corporations , 97 % of whom are male , @entity210 said			0
" her choices do n't necessarily work for women in lower ranks and should not be held up as a standard for what all men or women should or could do , " @entity210 said			2
" she 's playing by the good old boys ' rules , which uphold a system that does n't allow space and time for male or female @entity253 to really take time off if they need it			0
" facing tough choices some parents can take time off under the @entity270 , which guarantees eligible employees at companies with more than 50 employees 12 weeks of unpaid , job - guaranteed leave for the birth or adoption of a child , according to @entity128			2
similar statutes exist in @entity167 , @entity213 , @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288			0
in 2002 , @entity213 became the first state to enact a paid family leave act , allowing employees to take six weeks ' leave and up to 55 % of their weekly wages , with a benefit cap , to care for a newborn or newly adopted child			0
every employee who contributes to the @entity298 is covered , not just those who work for companies with 50 employees or more			0
although some individual companies offer a paid maternity leave benefit , many parents end up using a combination of short - term disability , sick leave , vacation , personal days and unpaid family leave			1
most working mothers return to work within a year of having a child , according to the 2009 report , " opting - out : an exploration of @entity314 , " based on the @entity316 three - year data file for 2005 - 2007			2
the researchers hypothesized that two groups of women may opt out : women whose earnings are so low they may not be able to afford child care and women whose family earnings allow them to forgo personal earnings			0
a 2004 @entity128 study found that while senior - level women and men showed interest in informal and formal flexible work arrangements , few actually took advantage of them : 44 % of women used flexible arrival and departure times , compared with 36 % of men ; and 13 % of women telecommuted or worked from home , compared with 12 % of men			1
perhaps the most telling is that 91 % of women and 94 % of men agreed that they could be flexible with their schedules when they had a family emergency or personal matter , but only 15 % of women and 20 % of men said that they could use a flexible work arrangement without jeopardizing career advancement			1
in the absence of policies that help working mothers , some end up leaving the work force or creating their own solutions			2
ireporter @entity353 of @entity355 , @entity356 , took a pay cut when she changed jobs after finding out she was pregnant			0
" [ @entity359 ] took a position that unfortunately pays less , but it allows me to have the mental and physical strength for my son , " @entity353 said in an @entity74			0
" i 've already accomplished some career goals , and being a mother is the career i would love to concentrate on now			0
" the most challenging thing about being a working mom is not being able to experience the day to day growth of my son			0
