@entity0 -- even as he charges into his re-election battle , president @entity2 has a festering weakness on a flank that , by all accounts , ought to be rock solid : the one held by @entity9 @entity8			1
their support for his programs , belief in his leadership and enthusiasm for another term is softening just as he needs it most			2
in the past few weeks , the president has been chastised by the @entity19 for avoiding troubled inner - city districts , peppered with tough questions on @entity22 , and suffered plummeting poll numbers among black voters			1
that last item is critical			0
during the 2008 election , their turnout was massive and their support almost unanimous			0
now , however , a @entity33 / @entity32 poll finds that black voters with a " strongly favorable " view of @entity2 dropped from 86 % to 58 % in just five months			1
" @entity39 is running out , " says @entity36 , a professor of sociology at the @entity38			1
@entity36 has written extensively about race and politics			1
" people are disappointed because i think their expectations were way too high to begin with			0
" many political analysts sum up those " expectations run amok " this way : white voters heralded the election of a black president as a sign that long - standing racial gaps were closing , and they expected @entity2 to play a post-racial role ; a president for everyone , who just happened to be black			1
meanwhile , many @entity9 - @entity9 voters just as clearly saw his election as a great leap forward and hoped the presence of a black president in the @entity60 would bring a new level of understanding , acknowledgment , and relief for their community 's problems			1
" finding a middle ground is almost an impossibility , " @entity67 says			1
" it 's just the worst position to be in			0
" the driving problem , however , is neither black nor white -- it is green			0
joblessness , bad for everyone , is much worse in @entity9 - @entity9 communities , where unemployment is pushing 17 % , the worst since the 1980s			0
that is what triggered the revolt in the @entity19 and those stinging questions during that tv interview			1
the president is pushing back , pointing out that his initiatives , such as health care reform and the recent jobs bill , especially help lower - income families , many of whom are black			1
on @entity22 , he quickly dismissed talk about a dearth of specific programs for minorities			2
" what people are saying all across the country is we are hurting and we 've been hurting for a long time , " the president said			0
" the question is : how can we make sure the economy is working for every single person ? " he also insisted that even if black leaders are grousing , it 's not really about him or his policies			2
" there 's always going to be somebody who is critical of the president of the @entity110			0
" and at a @entity19 fundraising dinner he raised eyebrows by telling members to quit complaining and start " marching " with him for change			2
but if the reaction of rep. @entity118 , @entity119 , is any gauge , he 'll have to do a lot more selling			0
she summed up his comments in a word : " @entity126			0
" to be sure , most african - americans still support @entity2			1
political analysts do not expect a massive shift of their votes to the @entity131 ; and even the president 's most adamant black critics often follow their barbs with a quick salve , saying @entity9 voters ultimately will not oppose him			2
still , the danger for the @entity138 is not that black citizens will vote against @entity2 , but that they wo n't vote at all			1
a lackluster turnout in just a few key states could tip the electoral balance against him			0
what 's more , every moment he spends making sure black democrats come to the polls increases his risk of alienating white voters , and is time lost winning over independents , whom he also must have			2
politically , it is hard for a candidate to tiptoe through such a black - and - white minefield			0
for a president , it is even tougher .			0

in recent weeks , @entity2 's support among blacks has been beset by troubles
among them : @entity19 *scolding* , *hardball* questions on @entity22 , black jobless numbers
he faces a balancing act in the 2012 campaign in appealing to various blocs
