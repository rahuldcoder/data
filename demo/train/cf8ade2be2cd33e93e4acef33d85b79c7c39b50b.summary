-- for me , @entity1 used to be fun			1
when i was a kid , i was excited during @entity1 when i got lai see and i could stay up late			1
i even had access to candy , a once - a - year treat while living under the roof of my @entity8			2
riding strong on the sugar highs , i always thought to myself , this is what it must feel like to be an adult			1
i was flush , free and giddy			2
then at some point in my twenties , @entity1 became a chore			1
not any garden variety chore , but a cold - sweat - inducing family obligation that i try hard to avoid			2
as an adult , @entity1 is an annual nightmare , for the following reasons : 1			1
i find it sucks when you are single relatives feel that they have a right to judge you because you do share bits of dna , so , really , it 's almost like they 're judging themselves			1
typically , the extended family gathers for @entity1 and spends an inordinate amount of time together , during which people get bored and focus their restlessness on judging the younger generation , particularly those who are single			1
@entity37 means a lack of responsibilities and responsibility - free people need to be reined in by the wisdom of elders , or they will be reckless with their directionless lives			2
here are some unavoidable conversations at @entity1			1
by " conversations " i really mean monologues by one @entity47 or another , fired away at a particular @entity49 in a trance - like manner : " why do n't you have a boyfriend ? if you have a boyfriend , why do n't you get married ? " " why are you not dieting at least a little bit ? @entity56 will have to start bringing clothes from @entity58 for you			1
" " what happened to your hair ? @entity61 is not such a good color for us @entity1 people			1
" " are you saving up for an apartment ? why not ? the most important thing in life is to have a roof over your head			2
you do n't want to be homeless , do you ? what if the economy collapses again ? at least you will have an apartment			1
" " why do n't you get a better paid job ? you are wasting your talent			1
you will regret your life			2
i am employed i loved the great @entity1 tradition of gifting lai see			1
getting hk $ 20 for no reason other than tradition really rocked my seven - year - old world			0
i have an income now , so twenty bucks here and there does n't make a huge difference , but i still retain that childhood anticipation for the red packets			1
it 's just a bit disappointing when i open up an envelope and it is n't concealing a massive check			1
and it 's the guilt from feeling disappointed that makes me really hate @entity1 for making me hate myself			1
it 's just like being unable to conceal your letdown expression when unwrapping that pair of socks at @entity96 parties			2
gifting is a heartwarming tradition			0
it 's the thought that counts			2
i am not supposed to care			0
i am a bad person			0
@entity1 gambling is just out of hand			1
now that i have a job , i 'm expected to bet real money at @entity105 , a @entity106 filled with hidden agendas , treacherous scheming and @entity110 - faced traitors			0
if you beat your elder relatives at mahjong one too many times , beware their wrath			2
it really hurts when you get hit by a mahjong tile			0
if you lose on purpose to your elders and are unable to skillfully conceal your purposefulness , you risk looking patronizing			0
it will put them in a bad mood and lead to a vengeful " what are you doing with your life " interrogation later			0
if you 're simply crap at the game , you lose a load of money and will probably be judged for being not very intelligent			0
see point number one again			0
i like good food when foreigners make jokes about @entity137 eating weird foods , i cringe			2
when @entity1 comes around , i 'm the one making the damn jokes			1
at this time of year , we do get some incredible festive dishes			2
and then there are those odd ones that make you feel like the taste , texture and nutritional content of food have all become irrelevant -- we only eat for superstitions			0
lots of @entity1 foods are auspicious in meaning , but atrocious in taste			1
i propose that we at least get rid of these three that are now out of touch with our lives : @entity1 cake called " leen go " in @entity160 ( " niangao " in mainland @entity137 ) , the name sounds auspicious and means " to progress more and reach higher every year			1
" the cake is made from glutionous rice , sugar and flavored with red bean paste or jujubes			0
cut into thin slices , dip into beaten eggs and pan fry until it 's gooey on the inside and crisp on the outside			2
the problem is , no one makes these at home anymore and the store - bought version is bland and stodgy , like eating slices of caulking			0
since glutinous rice is considered difficult to digest for the elderly , us @entity178 who have nothing to lose are forced to finish the plateful			0
sugared lotus seeds back in the day -- before globalization brought us jelly beans and @entity185 , before the invention of @entity187 , before @entity188 brought cocoa beans to the @entity190 -- eating sugar - coated lotus seeds during @entity1 seemed like a good idea			1
today , we have so many more delicious ways to feed our sweet tooth , so why do people still buy sugared lotus seeds ? they look like mothballs , taste one dimensional and feel like a marble of sand broken upon the tongue			0
the name " leen tsi " sounds like " to birth sons each year			0
" no one in the family likes to eat them and most of them already have kids , which means us @entity208 have to swallow			0
@entity210 these are deep - fried sweet dumplings			0
the skin is a thick , lifeless pastry made from lard , the filling is a mind - numbingly sweet blend of sugar and nuts			0
its shape and color makes it , somewhat , resemble a gold ingot			0
eating these symbolize prosperity for the new year			0
if i had to run a marathon , i might appreciate the fat bomb			0
but the only thing that i run are scripts on my browser			0
that point , like the others in this post , is lost on the @entity234 , wise as they are			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237			1
a former @entity0 employee , @entity237 is a @entity239 resident and edits the @entity239 section of @entity241 .			1

@entity237 : as an adult , @entity1 is an annual nightmare
it 's a time when relatives have the right to be judgmental
superstitious @entity1 foods often are n't that tasty
