@entity0 -- political fireworks over a little - noticed @entity10 appeal and a separate whistleblower lawsuit had @entity3 attorney general @entity2 and a longtime congressional adversary exchanging harsh words at a @entity7 hearing wednesday			1
@entity2 , testifying before the @entity13 - led @entity12 , sparred with @entity13 rep. @entity14 of @entity15 over congressional requests for private e-mails of top @entity2 aide @entity18 , who is president @entity19 's nominee to be @entity20			1
@entity14 suggested @entity2 had political motives for delaying release of the electronic messages			1
the two repeatedly talked over each other , and @entity2 concluded the exchange with a personal attack			2
" it is inappropriate and it is too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of @entity32			1
it is unacceptable and it is shameful , " he told @entity14 , the chairman of the @entity34 who led the effort last year to cite @entity2 for contempt of @entity32 in the panel 's investigation of the @entity40 gun - walking program			1
other committee members from both parties then openly debated the propriety of @entity14 's questioning			1
at issue is whether @entity18 -- who heads the @entity49 's @entity48 -- improperly intervened with @entity50 , @entity51 , officials last year in getting them to drop the city 's pending @entity10 appeal over public housing conditions			1
the @entity49 pulled out of a separate lawsuit it had joined that was brought by a neighborhood pastor and whistleblower			0
in a report last month , congressional @entity13 alleged that @entity18 engaged in a " quid pro quo , " placing " ideology over objectivity and politics over the rule of law			1
" @entity14 opened his questioning by playing an audio clip of a phone call by @entity18			1
@entity14 suggested @entity18 in the call was trying to keep any arrangement with @entity50 officials from being disclosed publicly			1
the congressman then asked whether it was appropriate to " trade a case			2
" @entity2 shook his head and said , " i do n't agree with that characterization			2
" @entity79 rep. @entity78 of @entity80 then jumped in and questioned whether it was proper to play the audio clip without prior notification to committee @entity79			2
that prompted a spirited back - and - forth among members			0
congressional republicans say the alleged agreement between federal and city officials cost taxpayers $ 200 million dollars			0
@entity13 sen. @entity91 of @entity92 said tuesday that @entity18 's involvement should disqualify him to become @entity20			1
" i do not believe mr. @entity18 gave us the straight story when he was called upon to answer questions about this case , and for that reason i will strongly oppose his nomination , " @entity91 said in reference to questioning of @entity18 by the @entity95			1
the controversy concerns two separate court cases over alleged public housing discrimination in @entity51 's capital			0
the @entity10 case dealt with whether federal law allowed landlords who rent to minorities a right to challenge a city housing code			0
the @entity50 housing code requires properties to remain in habitable condition			0
the landlords claim city officials have been overly aggressive in enforcing those requirements , with the hardest impact on minority occupants			0
republicans said @entity18 was concerned a high court defeat for the city would set back or invalidate the legal strategy the @entity49 would use in other broader discrimination investigations			2
that strategy in short says plaintiffs need not show " intent " to discriminate , but merely that policies or enforcement have a " disparate impact " on minorities and other protected classes			0
just days before the @entity10 was set to hear oral arguments in @entity138 v. @entity139 in february 2012 , the city announced it was dropping its appeal			0
@entity142 e-mails obtained by @entity1 showed @entity18 helped persuade the city to withdraw , then pushed other federal officials to back out of separate private lawsuits against @entity50			2
led by rev. @entity147 , head of the @entity148 and a local jobs activist , the suits alleged the city fraudulently made certifications in federal @entity153 grants totaling about $ 200 million			0
" the department abandoned the whistleblower , @entity156 , after telling him for years that it supported his case , " said the report by congressional @entity13			1
" the manner in which the department treated @entity147 presents a disconcerting precedent for whistleblower relations			0
" city officials , the @entity49 , and some congressional democrats said the @entity153 grant lawsuits were without merit			0
a federal judge last year dismissed one of the suits			0
however , @entity13 legislators had issued a subpoena for @entity18 's private e-mails , saying he may have used personal accounts to arrange the deal			1
" we have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with legitimate oversight requests , " a @entity49 spokesperson said last month			0
because of the issue , @entity18 's confirmation hearings for @entity20 have been postponed			2
other contentious issues at the hearing dealt with a @entity49 investigation of @entity182 phone records as part of alleged leaks by government officials , and a probe into whether the @entity187 unfairly targeted conservative advocacy groups seeking tax - exempt status .			0
