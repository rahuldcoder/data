-- say goodbye to the share button because the like button is taking over			0
after months of updates to its @entity3 , @entity4 has released an update that fundamentally changes the button 's functionality to that of a share button			1
now after hitting the like button , a full story with a headline , blurb and thumbnail will be posted to your profile wall			1
you 'll also be given an option to comment on the story link			2
previously , only a link to the story would appear in the recent activity , often going unnoticed by users			2
though users may now think twice about hitting the button , given how prominently it will appear on their walls and in their networks ' newsfeeds , it should ultimately increase traffic to publishers ' websites			0
@entity4 has slowly been rolling out updates to its @entity3 button and has stopped developing the @entity37			1
@entity4 spokeswoman @entity38 told us that while the company will continue to support the share button , @entity3 is the " recommended solution moving forward			1
" however , @entity38 today called it a test , saying " we 're always testing new products that incorporate developer feedback as we work to improve the platform experience , and have no details to share at this time			0
" it 's unlikely that the change is just a test , however			0
typically such tests from @entity4 only affect a small number of users , whereas this change affects all like buttons			1
perhaps the change was necessary			0
because it was never made clear to users that the like button would function differently than the share button , many never understood what it meant to click @entity3 on a piece of content			2
making the result the same as the share button could build stronger user expectations , ultimately fashioning a better user experience			0
