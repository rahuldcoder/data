-- tractor - trailer drivers , if you text while driving in the middle of the freeway , then the future may belong to you			2
if you can afford a @entity9 truck , that is			1
the @entity11 vehicle maker sent an 18 - wheeler barreling down the @entity12 recently , while the driver surfed the internet for food recipes on tablet computer -- at least that 's how media photos told the story			1
its test drive was brief , covering about three miles , @entity11 media reported			0
the trucker 's hands did n't touch the wheel and his eyes were fixed on pork cutlets			2
but that could be the way some drive in the future , perhaps in the next decade or so			0
that 's the message of the prototype " @entity31 , " which @entity9 says is the first self - driven freight vehicle			1
it may seem illogical right now , but the hands - off idea is aimed at eliminating human error			0
special cameras and multiple radar systems watch the road , the sides of the road , and cars and trucks behind the vehicle			0
@entity31 is also envisioned to communicate with other vehicles and connect to growing sources of online information as @entity49 balloons on the road			2
its computerized controls will also make it more fuel efficient , @entity9 boasts			1
once the truck merges into traffic , it wo n't accelerate to @entity57 breakneck speeds			0
the system will throttle it to a meek 50 mph , @entity9 says			1
many of the component parts to put a vehicle like this into production are already available in trucks on the market : systems that help drivers keep their distance from other drivers , active braking assistance , guidance and mapping systems , and fine - tuned cruise control and tons of other hi - tech tchotchke			0
if a puttering slowpoke pulls out in front of @entity79 , it will slow down automatically to keep off of its bumper , but the 18 - wheeler wo n't pass it by itself			1
that 's when the driver will have to turn off the ball game , put down the @entity87 or lay away the knife and fork , then take the wheel			2
but he 'd be ill advised to goof off too much , because two cameras and a sensor under his seat will monitor his activities			0
@entity9 says that the trucker will still be expected to be responsible for controlling the vehicle			1
but by then they wo n't be called that anymore			0
in 2025 , they 'll be promoted to " transport managers			1
" holographic staff and no lost luggage : how you 'll travel in 2024 this helicopter flies itself			0

driver can surf the @entity107 or read while @entity79 does the work
but the trucker is *ultimately* responsible , and has to pass slow vehicles by hand
@entity9 envisions truckers of the futures acting as " transport managers "
