-- listening to the radio was something i did -- when i was a teenager			2
just take my middle and high school years where every morning , at 6:55 , i flipped on my @entity6 and began the trudge down the hill to the bus stop			1
it was tuned to @entity11 , which was @entity13 's " today 's @entity14 " station			2
every day , the crazy -- and at that time seemingly raunchy -- antics of its morning show with @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 made me excited to be awake			2
although the show offered really nothing of value to enrich my life , like a sugary drink , it did n't have to			2
in those 40 minutes on the bus , there was adequately funny banter ( which in hindsight , was terrible ) , vital information of what happened in @entity33 overnight , and most importantly , today 's hottest music			2
the @entity35 , then @entity36 , and that one @entity38 song ? if i heard that lineup again , @entity39 would probably melt in happiness			0
but my radio listening habits did n't end at 7:45 a.m. after school , i probably listened to the same set of music			1
the only difference was the afternoon slot felt like it was filled with endless commercials that did n't air in the morning			2
but it all stopped when i went to college			0
the pop music station in my new home , a small @entity54 town , could n't match the " talents " of @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 ( although it was not like i was awake at 7 a.m. to listen )			0
while i was slinking into my late teens , the playlist of that low - budget station felt like it was stuck in my middle - school years			0
by then , i was also hooked to my family 's satellite radio account , which was like terrestrial radio without all of those terrible commercials for car dealerships or rug outlets			1
and discovering new music on the internet around that time became easier			0
i trawled through @entity70 ' constantly updated charts			1
my friends posted recommendations on their @entity74 and @entity75 accounts , which substituted for radio stations plugging whatever artist their corporate parent suggested			0
also , my dorm 's high - speed internet connection allowed me to stream music from noncommercial stations all around the world , like @entity84 , to see what we would be listening to stateside in another six months			1
after college , i moved to @entity88 , @entity89 , a traffic - prone town where you would spend more time in your car than at your destination			1
but when i pulled into the city in 2012 , i did n't even bother to reset my car 's radio to the local stations			1
most if not all of the time , i was plugged into my satellite radio or my app - filled @entity101 , which played a steady stream of commercial - free music catering to my tastes			1
for my friends and me , the car 's auxiliary outlet killed the radio star			1
now i 'm 24 and the radio 's relevancy is fading faster than driving out of a signal 's reach			1
the @entity67 has made me an an " on - demand " listener , meaning i can listen to any song , from any artist , at any time			1
from music apps , websites ( like @entity119 ) , and the blogs , there are literally millions of sources to discover new music			0
i can listen to a new song seconds after it 's released and not wait days , or even weeks , before the radio bothers to play it			1
and , ugh , those cheesy djs are no longer polluting my listening experience with their allegedly wacky and zany gags			0
the definition of @entity128 has shifted from @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , to actual , physical djs , who spin " records " like @entity135 or @entity136			0
it 's not just me			0
every morning , my wretched millennial friends awake to freshly brewed tunes from our favorite blogs			0
new music from my friends fills up my @entity145 inbox at a seemingly never - ending pace ( and vice versa )			0
i would be scared to hear how loud the laugh would be if anyone asked if we 'd discovered a half - decent new song on the radio in the past five years			0
i do n't know even know what channel to find that on ! since the @entity101 has replaced my @entity6 , my friends have replaced the @entity128 , and the ability to listen to whatever i want at any given moment kicked out radio stations ' playlists , i would say it 's time to turn off the radio for good			1
but i already did that five years ago			0
