-- to be a @entity2 baseball fan does n't compare to the prestige of growing up in the shadows of @entity5 , @entity6 or @entity7			1
the pinstriped jerseys , classic uniforms and ball caps of those @entity12 teams are timeless and have become iconic touchstones in pop culture			2
it 's easy to be a baseball fan if you root for teams with rich history like the @entity20 , @entity21 and both @entity23 teams , the @entity24 and @entity25			1
baseball purists must have cringed back in 1972 when the @entity2 unveiled the team logo of a baseball wearing a 10 - gallon cowboy hat			1
calling the @entity2 your team meant you truly loved baseball			1
what 's the power of a good luck charm ? the @entity20 spent decades playing in the " @entity35 that @entity36 " while the @entity2 spent most of my childhood playing in an uninspired location			1
the " stadium " was a converted minor - league field that looked like an open - air county arena better suited for rodeos than baseball games			1
but it was our @entity46			2
just hours before @entity49 in 1975 , a helicopter was brought in to hover over the wet field to dry out two days worth of rain			2
the result ? the chopper crashed and gashed the field just beyond third base			2
it would take another 20 years for the @entity2 to taste the playoffs			1
but the " curse of the @entity61 " does n't have the same mystique as the @entity21 's " @entity58 " or the @entity24 ' " @entity59			2
" the @entity2 team was a collection of misfit has - beens and never - would - bes who made every kid think , " if these guys can be ballplayers , surely i can be one , too			1
" april 12 , 1991 , was my chance to impress the @entity2 scouts			1
before the game , i was invited to play in a fly - ball catching contest			2
after hearing the stadium announcer call my name , i trotted out onto the hallowed grass of @entity77			2
a pitching machine launched the first two fly balls toward me , and with thousands of people watching , i snagged both balls			2
one more catch and the entire stadium would be rewarded with a free medium soft drink from @entity85			2
this is where i learned never to underestimate @entity89 's love for winning free stuff no matter how trivial it might be			1
the crowd came to its feet and erupted into the loudest cheers i think i 've ever heard			2
the machine launched a major league pop fly that seemed to take forever to come down			2
as i started to fall over i put my glove up and felt the ball smack the leather webbing			0
i got up , looked into the glove and it was still there			0
that was the first time i was able to scream , " free drinks for everyone ! " i ran off the field in glory			0
i still have that ball			0
i had all my buddies with me that day autograph it , just like real ball players do			0
@entity23 has its " @entity24 " in the @entity24			0
@entity2 fans needed @entity116 beer to love its losers			1
even the most fanatic baseball fan is hard - pressed to name the players who we called our own			1
@entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125			0
who ? we watched a guy named @entity129 throw 50 mph knuckleballs and then puff on cigarettes in the dugout between innings			0
we went to the stadium and bought $ 4 outfield seats			0
all for the privilege of watching terrible baseball in the scorching @entity140 heat , suffering third - degree burns from sitting on the metal bleacher seats			1
in those early years , the season of hope was usually short - lived			2
you could count on the @entity2 to be out of playoff contention by the end of may , which was fine			1
we had bigger things to focus on , like the @entity150 packing their bags for training camp			0
the losing kept the bleacher seats cheap , which was fine for most fans			0
one of the best days of my life was witnessing the @entity2 battle the @entity21 on april 30 , 1989 , on my father 's birthday			1
i still have the ticket stub			0
hall - of - famer @entity161 pitched for the @entity2 , and future accused steroid user @entity164 pitched for the @entity21			1
an epic matchup that turned out to be an epic game			0
@entity161 struck out 11 batters			0
@entity161 and @entity164 cruised but the @entity21 had a 1 - 0 lead in the bottom of the eighth inning			0
until our favorite @entity176 - exile came to the plate , @entity174 stroked a beautiful two - run home run down the right field			0
the @entity2 won 2 - 1			1
outside the stadium after the game , i got @entity161 to autograph my baseball , and then i tried to get @entity164 ' autograph and learned a valuable lesson from my dad			2
my dad patted me on the back and said , " do n't be afraid			0
go up to him and ask him for an autograph			0
" with quivering hands i gave @entity164 the ball			0
@entity164 took the ball , and now i can say i 'm the proud owner of @entity164 scribble			0
most days i 've spent watching @entity2 baseball have n't compared to that day			1
but we @entity176 love our baseball , and we 'll take it any way we can get it			2
in the early 1990s , baseball started to change			2
the old stadium was bulldozed and replaced with a shrine more fitting of a noble baseball team			1
the @entity2 flirted with the playoffs three times in the late - 1990s			1
they played 10 games and lost nine			0
it 's the kind of angst and teasing that only @entity24 and @entity21 fans can truly appreciate			0
that brush with success did n't last long			0
the @entity2 ushered in another decade of abysmal baseball that took the team to the brink of bankruptcy			1
that is until february 2008 , when @entity161 and the new ownership group rode into town and saved the day			0
in 2010 , under @entity161 's leadership , the @entity2 made it to the @entity220 for the first time in franchise history			1
@entity223 : @entity2 ' @entity224 : @entity220 hero or goat these modern - day @entity2 are a different story			1
the players probably are n't as fun and crazy as the misfits who sported the long - gone logo of the baseball wearing a 10 - gallon cowboy hat , but the team 's manager , @entity224 , is a throwback to the good old days			1
@entity239 dances , struts , mangles the @entity242 language in a beautiful way and frantically chomps on sunflower seeds			0
he is a baseball genius with the heart of a 12 - year - old kid cheering the team			1
in @entity224 's world , " that 's the way baseball go ! " now the @entity2 are on the brink of being @entity220 champions			1
the @entity255 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity24 fans look on with envy at a franchise that spent decades as a laughingstock			0
no one ever imagined we could even have a @entity220 parade to plan			1
@entity77 , @entity140 , ( where the @entity2 play ) has a downtown not worthy of a @entity220 party			1
but there is a @entity266 amusement park next to the stadium			0
instead of a parade , i think fans should ride the roller coasters with the players			0
that would be a fitting way to celebrate a tear - jerking relationship full of ups and downs .			0

the @entity2 are on the brink of winning their first @entity220
the @entity2 have been a *beleaguered* team for more than 20 years
