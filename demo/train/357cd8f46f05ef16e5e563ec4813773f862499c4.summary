@entity1 's @entity0 clinched the biggest prize in men 's skiing after winning the @entity6 downhill , considered the ' @entity7 ' of the sport			1
@entity0 , who had not performed well during friday 's super-g , recorded a time of 58.16 seconds , two - hundredths of a second ahead of the @entity14 @entity13			1
shortened course the time was half of what would usually be expected to win the title			2
appalling weather conditions , including heavy fog and snow , severally curtailed the race			1
such was the poor visibility that the organizers moved the start to the @entity28 jump , half way down the two mile course			0
it meant that many of the course 's most terrifying features , including the opening @entity36 -- or mousetrap -- which sees competitors reach speeds of close to 100 mph , had to be bypassed			0
' @entity40 turned into a kitten ' @entity0 had predicted that the course would be easier than usual			1
in a tweet sent before the race he said that the course was now a " tiger turned into a kitten , but still : safety first			0
" but that did n't detract from what must rank as the highlight of @entity0 's career so far			1
" winning in @entity6 has been a goal for many years , " the 29 - year - old said after his victory			2
" to make it happen is pretty extraordinary			0
" @entity57 flops , finally in the women 's downhill in @entity60 @entity57 finally proved she was fallible after a rare mistake saw her finish 23rd			1
@entity57 , who wore the slogan " @entity67 " on her bib , had the chance to extend her @entity69 win record			2
instead @entity73 's @entity72 gave the home crowd something to cheer with a winning time of 1 minute 43.82 seconds			0
" i simply looked to find the shortest line , " @entity72 said after her victory			0
" it was very tough to ski			0
