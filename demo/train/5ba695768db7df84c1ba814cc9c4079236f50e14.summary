-- law student @entity1 summed up the feelings of many @entity3 late tuesday night : " i can finally sleep again , " he said			1
president @entity4 was was re-elected with 303 electoral votes to @entity6 's 206			1
in a race that seemed too close to call until the votes were tallied , @entity7 ultimately chose four more years			1
even though voters indicated to pollsters that their financial situation is the same or worse than it was four years ago , they put their trust in the president			2
@entity4 " got off to a semi-rocky start , but i think that with another four years , we have a good chance , " said @entity14 , who celebrated @entity4 's victory in the streets of @entity17			1
" we have a foundation now			0
... we can only go up from here			0
" " his re-election ... will allow me to stay in school and have health protection , " agreed @entity24 college student @entity23			0
like @entity23 , many @entity7 considered health care when voting ; exit polls had its importance second only to the economy			1
@entity6 supporters were obviously disappointed with the results of the close election , but they were comforted somewhat by the @entity36 remaining under @entity38 control			1
" hopefully @entity4 can turn it around , " wrote @entity0 commenter otacon7272			1
" at least he wo n't be able to make things that much worse with the @entity38 in control of the @entity36			1
" others were n't quite so optimistic			0
" i 'm sorry , but what i see ahead for @entity7 is what we see in @entity51 countries now , " said @entity44 of @entity45 , @entity46			1
" everyone is poor except the government ; everyone relies on the government for everything			0
" members of both parties were quick to weigh in on what they 'd like to see in the next four years			0
" let 's see some action this time , " said @entity60 of @entity61 , @entity46			2
she 's an @entity4 supporter , but hopes the president 's policies will have a more concrete effect on her life in the next four years , such as allowing her to make a living wage and stop using food stamps			1
" i would also like to see a @entity70 of sorts , more money put into rebuilding states and cities hit by disaster or economic ruin			0
" " i want to see @entity4 get spending under control , " said @entity6 voter @entity77			2
the @entity17 resident had hoped that @entity6 would cut the deficit if he won			0
" i think ( @entity4 ) believes he wants to increase taxes on the wealthy			2
i do n't agree with that , but there has to be a solution			0
" and some questioned whether the election would make much of a difference to the country at all			0
" i see little being accomplished unless members of @entity93 and the president finally start talking with one another , find where they can agree and do what is right for we , the people , " said @entity38 @entity89 of @entity90 , @entity91			2
" i am not sure if either @entity38 or @entity3 will be that willing to compromise			1
once elected , we expect our officials to lay aside the party hats and work for all @entity7			2
i am afraid they wo n't			0
" but rider -- the sleepless @entity4 voter who can finally get some rest -- disagrees			2
" i think it has a profound impact , " he said			0
" i just think ( it ) is a fundamental question of which direction we want to take -- there is symbolism here			0
" opinion : five things @entity4 must do @entity0 's @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 contributed to this report .			1

voters *sharply* divided on what @entity4 win means for @entity7
@entity3 say @entity4 's laid a foundation and can now take action
@entity38 hope to see *bipartisan* efforts
@entity130 : what do you think the election means for you ?
