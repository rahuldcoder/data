-- known for his outspoken , unapologetic support of migrants in @entity4 , the rev. @entity1 is bringing his message to the @entity6			1
the priest is part of a caravan of migrants and their supporters traveling from @entity12 to @entity13 to push for immigration reform			1
in @entity4 , @entity1 has criticized the government , and even the @entity16 , saying that both can be more compassionate to migrants			1
his views are shaped by the years he has spent leading a migrant shelter in @entity21 that offers support to @entity23 who embark on the dangerous route north by clinging to trains			1
a number of threats last year led to his leaving his post , located in @entity30 , in the southern state of @entity21 , but he has since returned			2
" i do n't know how to live with fear , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
immigration issues must be tackled both at the source and the destination of the migrants , he said			0
in the @entity6 , @entity1 says he wants to include more voices in the debate			1
" not just the voice of the north , but the voice of the south , the voice of the poor , the voice of the migrants			0
" the 68 - year - old , wearing a white button - down shirt , cream - colored vest , thin glasses and a cross necklace , admits that he believes his opinion will have little sway			0
with so much money and political interests at play , the voice of a @entity4 priest is likely to get drowned out , he said			2
the caravan 's participants are lobbying for a path to citizenship , a stop to the separation of families , and greater attention to the human cost of immigration policies			0
the priest says he is not advocating a certain policy , but wants to raise consciousness about the issue			0
an immigration bill currently pending in the @entity74 commits additional resources to southern border security and establishes a new system of metrics to measure border control effectiveness , but critics insist the plan is full of holes and will ultimately do little to help stem to the tide of illegal immigration			0
while claiming to strengthen the border , the legislation also would create a 13 - year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants while bringing dramatic change to labor policy on @entity6 's farms			2
@entity6 tactics like a border wall and restrictive immigration policies do nothing other than drive up the price that smugglers charge to sneak people across the border , he said			1
at the migrant shelter in @entity21 , @entity1 says he sees constant suffering , but also constant hope in the people who pass by			1
during his brief exile from the shelter , @entity1 spent a month in @entity108 followed by some weeks of reflection in @entity110 before returning to @entity21			1
after doing much reading and writing during his time away , the priest said he returned with a deeper commitment for acting now , for helping migrants today , he said			0
" each day god gives me the grace to be happy , he provides strength , but at the end of the day my heart hurts , it tires emotionally , " he said			0
