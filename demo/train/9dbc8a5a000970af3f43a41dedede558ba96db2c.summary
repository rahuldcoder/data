-- " pain is weakness leaving the body			0
" it 's written large in ink on his upper torso , and , at the age of just 23 , @entity4 knows all about pain -- and the strength needed to overcome it			1
as a speedway rider he has broken virtually every bone on the way to becoming world champion in what is surely one of the most visceral types of racing -- hurtling around a gravel track on a motorbike with no gears and no brakes			1
and on his skin you can see how just he has embraced the hurt that life brings			0
" they say your body 's a temple , so why not decorate the walls , " says @entity4 , who looks like any alternative skater kid with his backwards cap , skinny black jeans and gaping gauge earrings			1
" i just enjoy pain , i guess			0
i like the art , " he tells @entity0 's human to @entity38			2
his arms , hands , face , neck and shoulders are all adorned with tattoos , including the aforementioned quote about the departure of pain -- popularly attributed to a @entity49 general -- emblazoned below his battered collarbone			2
his fingers bear the acronym " @entity52 " -- the calling card for rebellious teens across the western world			2
but most revealing is the design on his back -- a portrait of his father and racing mentor , and one of the letters he wrote to his son before passing away in 2010			1
" i have tried to take you everywhere with me			0
we have had some wicked times together , " it reads , above the epitaph " in @entity71			0
" @entity72 , himself a former speedway rider , did not live to see his 50th birthday			1
nor did he see @entity76 fulfill his great promise last year , when he became the youngest world champion in the modern @entity80 era			1
but his legacy lives on , and he will not be forgotten			0
following his retirement as a racer , he took the @entity4 family from the industrial @entity86 town of @entity87 to @entity88			1
" it was purely just to give me a better upbringing , " says @entity89 , in his distinctly @entity88 accent			1
" i think it was a great decision that they made			0
but , you know , it 's good to be back here and doing what i love			0
" it was in @entity100 where he took up speedway riding at the age of 12 , having first got into motocross -- thrilling off - road racing that still has him hooked today			1
" he did n't know if he wanted me to get into it , but we went ahead with it and i kept progressing and progressing , and when i was 15 and a half we made the decision to come back to @entity110 and show everybody how i ride , " @entity89 says			1
" we kind of left our whole life in @entity88 , we just stopped everything -- i mean , my dad was selling cars on a car yard			1
" quickly making his mark as a teen prodigy , @entity117 rose up the ranks , breaking records on the way			0
" my progression over the last eight years has been pretty crazy , really , " he says , at the home stadium of his @entity126 team @entity123			1
thick @entity86 fog rolls in over the concrete terraces , still strewn with remnants of a preseason exhibition for fans the previous night			1
the bleak surroundings are a far cry from the blue skies @entity136 -- bike engines roar from the pits as the mechanics get ready for training , while groundstaff smooth out the stoney circuit			0
" there 's only one year when i plateaued off , " @entity4 continues , " but apart from that , it was just upwards , upwards , upwards			1
i just kept going and going , every challenge that came in front of me , i conquered it			0
" that " plateau " came when his father succumbed to an inoperable tumor			0
" i had a really tough season , so a lot of people doubted me , " he says			0
" my father passed away that year and i had a lot of problems in the team			1
" but his fortunes changed last year , when he was again given a wildcard entry into the @entity80 series			0
" the people that ran the series wanted a @entity126 rider in and there was n't really any @entity126 riders qualifying -- it gave me the opportunity , " he explains			1
" at the start of the year i was 500 - to - 1 at the bookies			1
we were just aiming for a top - eight finish to secure me a spot for next year , because i did n't really want to be one of those riders that gets a wildcard every year			2
" @entity4 set his sights higher after an impressive start before breaking his collarbone in his home @entity126 gp			1
he returned to action just two weeks later , but broke it again in the penultimate round with the title in sight			0
" there 's times where you 've got to dig deep and that was definitely one of the days where i did -- i was crying in between races , " he recalls of the series , which involved 11 meetings across @entity110 after the opener in @entity193			1
" but i got another seven points and that was crucial going into the last round , and i clinched the championship in my second race			0
" i did n't actually realize that i 'd won the championship when i crossed the finish line , the tv presenter was hanging over the fence going , ' you 've done it , you 've done it			0
' " when i saw him , the weight just came off and it was an amazing feeling			0
" that success has moved him up into the big league of the speedway world			2
his protective suit is covered in sponsors ' logos and he is in big demand -- as well as @entity123 , @entity4 will also ride for clubs in @entity216 and @entity217 , plus the @entity218			2
it means he 's training , racing and traveling seven days a week , and he could n't be happier			2
" across @entity110 it 's pretty big			1
you know , @entity216 they get 20 - 25,000 just to a league meeting			0
@entity217 's pretty busy as well , " @entity4 says			1
" i ride @entity216 on a sunday , @entity86 on a monday and @entity217 on a tuesday			2
i can do @entity226 on a wednesday or @entity227 or @entity228 on a wednesday if i wanted to , but you can do too much			0
" despite his @entity88 upbringing , @entity4 has been named captain of @entity126 's @entity80 team this season , which kicked off domestically this month			1
" i 'm definitely more @entity126			2
i was born here and i ride for my country , but @entity88 is always going to be home for me , i go there every winter in the offseason , " he says			1
the challenge now is to retain his world title , something that only two riders have done in the past 20 years			1
" i did everything i could to make it happen			0
i was training hard , i was eating properly , i had the best bikes i could have , the best engines , a good team around me -- even down to my mum and my girlfriend booking flights and keeping all the logistics , " @entity4 says			2
" it 's like a thousand - piece puzzle and you 've got to have every single piece to that puzzle			2
last year i had it and hopefully this year i 'll have it as well			0
" for someone of his age , he has a great awareness of his responsibilities -- to his teammates , his fans and his sponsors -- but when it comes down to it , he 's still a kid going full throttle			0
" nothing comes close to it , except maybe skydiving			0
when you 're at the start line just revving your engine up , and you 've got the other boys on the inside of you and everyone wants to be there first ... going down the back - straight and you 've got somebody inches away from you and your elbows are rubbing and you 've got to get it into next corner ... it 's just a great feeling			2
" and it makes all the pain worthwhile .			0
