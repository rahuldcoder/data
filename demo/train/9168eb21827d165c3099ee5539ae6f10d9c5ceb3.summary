@entity0 , @entity1 -- when he was just 28 @entity3 won the @entity4 at the @entity6 film festival for his controversial movie " @entity8 "			1
@entity3 says the best way to see the city is on the back of a motor scooter			2
since then he has melted hearts playing @entity13 in " @entity14 " and has made his mark in @entity16 as an actor and a director , starring in @entity20 's " @entity19 " and directing psychological horror " @entity22 "			1
my @entity25 , my life spoke to @entity3 about movie - making , creativity and life in @entity0			1
@entity2 : how does it feel to be part of @entity0 film history and growing up in the birthplace of modern cinema ? @entity3 : it 's very inspirational to have seen all these movies that made @entity1 movie history and film history , period , and being able to go to the same places and see where all these pre-war movies were made			1
@entity0 is still the same as it was , so the spirit is the same also and it 's kind of elevating for us directors to be in a town with a city soul , a lot of soul			2
so it gives you a lot of opportunities and ways of not just showing a city , but the spirit of that city ; so that 's what we keep on doing today			2
@entity2 : what do you think it is about @entity0 that encourages creativity in people ? @entity3 : buildings are , of course , amazing and locations are so cinematic that it 's a pleasure for a director to shoot in a town like that			1
but especially the spirit of it , and the spirit of the @entity71 , the way the city coexists with everybody and that mixture of different people and of different backgrounds			0
all that makes @entity0 inspirational for us			1
@entity2 : what was it that made you decide to become a film - maker ? @entity3 : becoming a film - maker was , i think , a decision that i took while watching movies			1
it 's just a way to express myself and a way to just try to bring to people when i walk around a city , when i see something			0
i became a director because i am urban : i live in a very urban and fast city			2
you go from place to place and you never stay in one place and that 's what gives you the energy			2
and it 's so cinematic , you ca n't avoid it			0
@entity2 : are @entity104 the most stylish people in the world and are the men really the most romantic ? @entity3 : i think that men are not romantic anywhere in the world and @entity0 wo n't make it change			1
stylistically talking , i think @entity104 have a pretty good sense of taste and they know how to handle themselves			2
and i think @entity1 people , the @entity104 especially , are kind of classy			0
@entity2 : your characters are always telling interesting anecdotes and little stories			0
where does that come from ? @entity3 : all those anecdotes are really part of what we are in @entity1			2
we like to talk a lot , we like to scrutinize everything and just not let it go that fast			0
so we question everything , everything we do , everything that we see , and that 's part of our culture			0
@entity2 : you 're pretty big time now , why are you still here and not living in the @entity131 ? @entity3 : why am i still here ? because this is the most beautiful city in the world ! i would n't live in @entity135 for any money in the world ; it 's no relationship , no comparison			1
@entity0 is a city with soul , it 's a city with a past			2
you can feel it everywhere and i 'm a part of it , i ca n't avoid it			0
@entity2 : are they any places you 'd go to relax or just reflect on what you are doing ? @entity3 : no , in the city here , no , no , no. you know , my take on the city is that there is no specific place : the whole thing is crazy , the whole thing is inspirational			1
i do n't go to places , i just drive around and i see things			0
i look at people more than the buildings -- and that 's what makes stories			0
@entity2 : what is it that makes it stay the same , what 's it 's heartbeat that makes @entity0 ? @entity3 : the heartbeat is @entity104			1
@entity104 are obnoxious and impolite and everything you can imagine about them			0
but they are also very co-operative within themselves and are pretty open to everything else			0
@entity2 : do you think that there 's one place in @entity0 that stands out amongst the others ? @entity3 : i think what i like about @entity0 are unknown and unnamed little streets that are not on the map , and the history that goes with it			1
@entity2 : do you think that you truly have to be part of a city , to share a history with it , to truly represent it as a director ? @entity3 : you have to know what you are talking about			1
it 's interesting to go to a city that you do n't know about and try to represent it but i do n't think that you 'll be able to bring the soul of the city in the movie			0
it takes a lot of time for me to get to another city -- anywhere in the world -- and like it , because i like this one so much and i know it so much that this is home			0
anywhere else is not home			0
@entity2 : if @entity0 was a person , how would you describe it to friends ? @entity3 : a good - looking girl with a big mouth -- very loud !			1

@entity3 was just 28 when he won @entity4 at @entity6 for " @entity8 "
*success* in @entity16 has taken him to @entity135 but he *prefers* to live in @entity0
he says @entity0 is inspirational for a director because of its place in film history
if @entity0 was a person , he says it would be " a good - looking girl with a big mouth "
