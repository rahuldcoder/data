-- firefighters determined to snuff out a wildfire that killed 19 of their colleagues scoured the scorched earth near @entity5 , @entity6 , on wednesday , searching for smoldering vegetation that could reignite and further spread the deadly @entity9 blaze			1
the nearly 600 firefighters and support workers assigned to the fire paused only to observe a moment of silence in honor of the 19 members of the @entity17 , who died sunday when the fire took a sudden unexpected turn			1
@entity21 warned team before fire killed 19 how to help the families the pause coincided with the movement of a convoy of vehicles driven to the fire by the @entity31 team			1
the vehicles are being returned to @entity5 , where they were based			1
to start the moment of silence , a loud alert tone sounded on firefighters ' radios and an unidentified fire team commander announced , " as the crew carriers for the @entity31 hot shots leaves the @entity41 fire and begin their journey home , all personnel in the incident will observe an operational pause , in observance of our fallen comrades			1
" wildfire crews across the country were being encouraged to observe a similar pause sometime wednesday , incident command spokesman @entity49 said			2
" it makes this fire much different from the other fires we fight , and i think people really want to put this thing to bed and get rid of it , " he said			1
@entity61 said he expected good progress on the fire and no further loss of life , but he said smoldering vegetation driven under and , in some cases , into crevices of rocks could quickly reignite under the right conditions and cause a sudden flare - up			1
the fire was offically listed as 45 % contained late wednesday			1
the possibility of thunderstorms thursday afternoon offered little promise of putting out the fire , @entity49 said			2
not only is much of the wood and grass that the fire could burn sheltered from the rain by boulders and other terrain features , thunderstorms bring the possibility of lighting and high winds that could spread the flames , he said			2
with so much of the work focused on ground work , four @entity90 @entity89 c - 130s brought in tuesday from firefighting duties in @entity94 will likely not be needed to fight the fire wednesday , @entity49 said			2
