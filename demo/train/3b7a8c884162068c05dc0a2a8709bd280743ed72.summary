for a long time it feels like we have n't seen much of @entity2			1
not for nothing , but i heard he shanked @entity6 in a back alley somewhere down in @entity8			2
that 's the rumor , anyway			1
however , now the famous fast - food clown is back in the spotlight , and everything seems right in his world			2
@entity2 's re-introduced @entity2 on wednesday , stating that he is " setting out on a global mission to rally the public through inspiring events			1
" i 'm sort of hoping this involves feats of strength , motorcycles , and explosions			2
and maybe some @entity23 / dc. but probably not			2
either way , good for him			2
it 's hard to find honest work , especially when your @entity29 skills include applying heavy makeup and crying yourself to sleep			1
of course , @entity2 , who 's been the face of the company since 1963 , is more than just a clown who goes on global missions			1
because behind all that face paint lies a ruthless hamburger kingpin with a never - say - die attitude , capable of striking fear into his trembling sales team			1
" put that @entity44 down ! @entity44 coffee 's for closers only			1
" yes , some may criticize @entity2 for being too influential , as he entices kids to eat unhealthy fast food			1
i do n't know the exact psychology behind it , but , presumably , it works like this : " hey kids , look at the funny clown			2
wee ! how ' bout a @entity56 ? " and i 'm ok with that			0
they 're overseeing a restaurant business			0
it 's not like @entity2 's is a tattoo parlor			1
" hey kids , look at the funny clown			0
wee ! how ' bout a koi fish on your neck ? " so , he 's a hamburger salesman			1
a little diabetes never hurt anyone			0
but as major companies move forward with trends in society , sometimes even cultural icons need a dramatic makeover			0
so , a major part of the big rollout was some new , updated clothes			0
and when you 're talking about the one and only @entity2 , that requires strategy and careful planning			1
you ca n't just throw this guy in a car and drive him down to @entity85			0
" here 's 50 bucks			1
" i mean , the man is a legend			0
he deserves only the best			0
which is why @entity2 's new wardrobe was created by @entity92 , an accomplished theatrical designer who won a @entity93 for " @entity94			1
" that said , it 's entirely possible that the marketing team simply threw @entity92 in a car and drove her down to @entity85 , because @entity2 's new getup includes cargo pants and a technical vest , as well as a red and white striped long - sleeve rugby shirt			1
@entity107 , in all fairness , it looks ok			0
somehow , @entity2 does sort of come off as fairly modern and relaxed , like a 20 - something heading out to see the @entity108			1
still , it 's worth noting that , amongst all these major changes , his iconic giant red shoes have n't			2
and he also now has a " whimsical " new blazer for special occasions			0
say , perhaps , a bris			0
" nice work , rabbi			0
" " thanks , @entity117			0
" but it was n't just a wardrobe makeover			2
when @entity2 's revealed @entity2 2014 to the world this week , the company also shared a new mission : fun makes great things happen			1
the idea , @entity125 says , is that moments of fun and enjoyment bring out the simple pleasures in life and can lead to acts of goodness			2
the other day i walked out my house without pants			0
next thing you know i 'm volunteering at a bake sale			0
it feels nice to give back to the community			0
beyond his updated clothes and new personal mission handed down from the @entity148 gods , what 's most fun about this whole new and improved @entity2 is that now he 's even taking on social media			1
in fact , @entity2 's actually been given the password for the official @entity2 's @entity154 account			1
that 's a lot of trust for a guy who hangs out with somebody named the @entity159			2
while @entity2 wo n't actually have his own personal @entity154 handle , he has been authorized to use his full name as a hashtag , marking the first time he 's taken an active part in the company 's social media strategy			1
really , the whole thing seems perfectly harmless			0
at least until he comes home buzzed after a @entity169 date			0
" boom ! two words			0
@entity6 # @entity172 " ask anyone with questionable morals : fun makes great things happen ! follow @ @entity177 on @entity154 .			1
