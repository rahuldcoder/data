-- i love you @entity3			1
you succinctly gave voice to the anger that 's been building ever since @entity7 columnist @entity6 wrote skeptically about young women caught up in a " supposed campus epidemic of rape , a.k.a. ' sexual assault			1
' " you remember that ? @entity6 said , in his special @entity6 way , that when colleges and universities " make victimhood a coveted status that confers privileges , victims proliferate			0
" you , @entity3 , gave voice to the anger that 's been simmering since @entity22 said , " no means yes if you know how to spot it , " and @entity28 joked about " taking the stairs " ' cause there are cameras in the elevator to record you punching your lady			1
you , @entity3 , succinctly said , in two words , how many women feel for getting blamed for everything from raising " problem children " to " feminizing " men			2
f * * * you ! @entity3 slams @entity36 for pulling song mr. @entity45 , if you 're wondering why you 're getting so much grief for that that two - game suspension you handed to @entity40 for decking his @entity42 © e , i 'll spell it out			1
you provided the tipping point for the anger women feel for getting blamed for just about everything bad that happens to them			0
voices of domestic violence it 's why @entity3 is so upset that @entity36 pulled her song " @entity54 " from @entity55 because , well , in @entity3 's words : " y'all are sad for penalizing me for this ... @entity36 you pulled my song last week , now you wan na slide it back in this thursday ? no , f * * * you ! y'all are sad for penalizing me for this			1
" oh , and do n't say you did n't penalize @entity3 for what @entity40 did to @entity62			1
@entity64 chairman @entity63 told the @entity65 that @entity3 's history of domestic abuse at the hands of @entity69 was " among several factors considered ( for pulling her song ) but was not the overriding one			1
" to make matters worse , it was n't even @entity3 's song ! it was @entity79 's song			1
@entity3 was merely performing alongside the man who discovered her			2
as @entity3 tweeted , " the audacity ... " and forbade @entity36 to use any of her songs in its @entity55 lineup ever again			2
@entity36 promptly announced : " beginning this thursday , we will be moving in a different direction with some elements of our @entity87			0
we will be using our newly created @entity55 theme music to open our game broadcast			0
it would have been a colossal mistake to bully @entity3 into singing for the @entity93			2
there have been so many strong , female voices speaking out about crimes against their sisters , and you know what ? people are listening			0
universities ( @entity102 most recently ) are more aggressively tackling sexual assaults on campus , there are now consequences -- at least for some -- for spouting irresponsible garbage about female victims			0
and the @entity93 ? it has now hired female advisers to shape its domestic violence policy			0
dare i say again , i love you @entity3 .			0

a song featuring @entity3 , a past victim of violence , was *shelved* after @entity40 case
@entity118 *praises* @entity3 for *refusing* to be victimized in the *process*
she says @entity3 gave voice to anger simmering as result of recent *controversy*
@entity118 : good for @entity3 that she would n't be victimized again
