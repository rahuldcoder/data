@entity1 , @entity2 -- " i read all about my condition on the @entity5 , " a recent patient proudly told me			0
like other doctors , i 'm seeing more patients research their symptoms thoroughly before setting foot in the exam room			1
patients are using the web in unprecedented ways for their own health empowerment			0
according to the @entity18 , 61 percent of @entity17 adults looked online for health information in 2009 , up from 46 percent in 2000			0
these " e-patients " are an essential part of the health care team , and play an increasingly influential role in the shared decision making process with their physicians			0
health technology commentator @entity27 observed in the @entity29 that " the amount of medical knowledge is beyond the reach of any one person , " and , " because clinicians are overwhelmed ... a huge amount of responsibility is devolving to individuals			0
" but she also noted that e-patients encounter physicians " who are often hostile to their efforts			0
" indeed , not every physician is enamored with the e-patient			0
in a @entity47 opinion piece , orthopedic surgeon @entity45 called a patient who googled her own health information a " brainsucker			0
" and , frustrated with the time needed to engage e-patients , he wondered , " if there [ were ] patients like this in poor , war - torn countries where the need for doctors is more dire			1
" most doctors , however , want their patients to be conscientious about their health and informed about their diseases			1
in a recent survey , health marketing firm @entity63 found that virtually all doctors had patients who searched for health information online , and more than two - thirds of physicians found this to be a positive trend			1
given that the majority of doctors support those who take a pro-active stance with their health , why would some patients perceive physicians as hostile to their empowerment ? simply put , our health system does not promote the communication necessary for physicians to engage e-patients			1
most primary care doctors practice in an environment dominated by 15 - minute office visits , where encounters are rushed and questions discouraged			1
patients , on average , are interrupted less than 20 seconds after they start talking , and half of them leave their appointment without fully understanding what the doctor actually said			2
as far back as a decade ago , more than two - thirds of physicians already reported not having enough time to spend with patients			2
and in the face of rising practice and malpractice insurance costs , doctors today are more fiscally pressured than ever to see a greater number of patients			1
@entity103 internist @entity102 wrote in the @entity104 that this leads to " care [ becoming ] increasingly fragmented , leaving patients angry and doctors frustrated			2
the time demands have exploded , which has eroded everyone 's ability to develop the personal , long - term relationships that are a great source of satisfaction for providers and comfort for patients			2
" furthermore , as other industries have embraced e-mail and digital record keeping , there is little financial incentive for doctors to use them			0
when a primary care doctor routinely sees 30 patients or more in a day , combined with hours wasted on health insurer bureaucracy , taking the additional time to e-mail patients is not fiscally feasible when it is not reimbursed by @entity130 or most health insurers			2
and with doctors receiving only 11 percent of the savings from implementing expensive digital records -- most of which goes to health insurance companies or the government -- it 's no wonder that only 13 percent of physicians have implemented an electronic record system			0
most doctors applaud patients who want to play an active role in their health			2
but neither the time physicians spend with their patients , nor the use of the tools necessary to facilitate a stronger patient - doctor relationship , are valued			1
instead of encouraging physicians to see more patients , @entity130 and the health insurers need to reward doctors who take the effort to engage e-patients both in the exam room and outside the clinic			1
e-patients can help , by recognizing the constraints on physicians and demanding that changes be made in the health system that will help doctors better meet the needs of empowered patients			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			0

more patients thoroughly research their conditions online
dr. @entity168 says they expect doctors who can respond to their concerns using new tools
he says doctors work in a pressured environment with little time to fully interact with patients
*pho* : doctors need incentives to encourage them to engage with e-patients
