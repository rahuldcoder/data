-- it has been said that a democratic republic such as ours is a do - it - yourself enterprise			2
people change the course of this country through conversation , debate and , eventually , consensus			0
as the 2012 elections near , these debates , particularly the upcoming presidential and vice presidential debates , take center stage			0
in light of what has been a long and tumultuous political season , here are my strongest arguments for @entity23 , rep. @entity24 , and fellow conservatives to explain to their fellow @entity26 why president @entity28 does not deserve a second term			1
@entity28 's handling of the economy : the @entity26 is mired in the midst of the worst recovery since the @entity34 : 43 straight months of unemployment over 8 %			1
the unemployment rate when @entity28 took office was 7.8 % and today it is 8.1 %			1
worse , the labor force is shrinking to record lows			0
people are giving up looking for work			0
in august the labor force participation rate fell to 63.5 % , its lowest level since september 1981			0
for men , the august participation rate in the labor force was 69.8 %			0
that 's the lowest ever on record			0
furthermore , half of all recent college graduates are underemployed or unemployed			0
since @entity28 took office , median household income has declined more than $ 4,000			1
more people are on food stamps than ever before -- 46.7 million			0
the poverty rate is around 15 % , the highest since 1993			0
the average retail price of gasoline has more than doubled under @entity28 , rising from $ 1.84 per gallon to more than $ 3.80 per gallon			1
in spite of this , he stopped the approval of the @entity63 pipeline for further review			0
opinion : @entity28 on world stage -- more hope than change ? @entity28 inherited a bad economy , but his policies have made it even worse			1
the $ 800 billion stimulus package failed , according to the standards promised by an @entity28 administration economist			1
with democrats in control of @entity77 , @entity28 then spent the next two years of his political capital on health care reform			1
subsequently , the nation , mired in a debt crisis , underwent its first - ever credit downgrade			0
with our national debt exceeding $ 16 trillion , he has offered no credible plan for the nation 's long term fiscal health			2
our country is hurtling toward a fiscal cliff in january 2013			0
foreign policy : @entity28 ascended to the presidency promising a new era of @entity26 foreign policy			1
apart from the killing of @entity98 , the death of @entity100 and and the successful expansion of drone strikes , the foreign policy record of this administration has largely been one of capitulation , indecision and weakness			1
in the first true foreign policy test of his presidency , @entity28 failed to back the pro-democracy @entity109 in @entity110 , saying he did n't want to " be seen as meddling			1
" the uprising was crushed			0
tell us : do you know who 's getting your vote ? when the @entity118 erupted , the president then decided to meddle in @entity119 , calling for @entity120 to step down			0
today , a country that was once a valuable @entity123 ally is under the majority control of the @entity125			0
but when the @entity118 spread to @entity127 , a longtime proxy of @entity110 , he did n't intervene , even when @entity129 began massacring his own people			0
the president has given some of our enemies a pass and some of our allies the back of the hand			0
he was caught on open mic badmouthing @entity140 and has n't visited @entity141 once in his presidency			0
he left our ally @entity144 out to dry by canceling the missile defense system in @entity146 , but was heard on an open mic assuring @entity149 president @entity148 that he will have " more flexibility " after the election to deal with missile defense			0
@entity26 's two most important investments in the @entity123 -- @entity154 and @entity155 -- are hanging by a thread			1
ignoring the recommendations of his generals , @entity28 pulled troops out of @entity154 and @entity155 prematurely			1
most recently , an @entity26 ambassador and three other @entity26 were killed in @entity161			2
yet , for nearly two weeks the administration blamed their deaths on a movie before finally admitting it was a terrorist attack , and took too long to make a forceful defense of the @entity167			0
obamacare : president @entity28 's crowning legislative achievement , whether he likes to admit it or not , is @entity168			1
@entity23 has promised to repeal the @entity168 and he should make his argument with these reasons : first , @entity168 is not romneycare			1
@entity174 was a state mandate ; @entity168 was a federal mandate			1
second , @entity168 is terrible federal policy			1
it is a massive tax increase over the next 10 years that will fall largely on middle - class families ; it steals more than $ 700 billion from @entity177 to pay for the expanded coverage under @entity168 ; the unelected @entity179 will ration and control @entity177 costs and services without the say of doctors and patients ; the @entity185 is granted virtually unfettered powers , like the contraception mandate			1
it was over 2,700 pages of complex rules and regulations passed behind closed doors with backroom deals -- exactly the opposite of what @entity28 promised when he campaigned in 2008			2
opinion : can @entity23 get back on track ? the imperial presidency : throughout his first term in office , the president has repeatedly ignored or gone around @entity77 and arrogated his own agenda through executive fiat			1
he instituted his own version of the @entity204 ; his administration granted waivers to welfare reform without the approval of @entity77 ; he refused to help @entity209 enforce its immigration laws ; he ordered his @entity211 to stop defending the @entity212 in court ; he gave states waivers to avoid @entity215 requirements ; he claimed executive privilege on @entity218 to protect the faults of his @entity211 and the @entity220 , @entity221 , firearms and @entity223 ( @entity220 ) ; and when the @entity224 refused to confirm his nominations to the @entity226 , he proclaimed the @entity224 was in recess and appointed them on his own			2
his own runaway @entity229 has waged regulatory war on coal plants resulting in the closure of six plants and possible closures of many more			0
broken promises : if you think i 'm being too hard on the president , let 's hold him to his own words and promises			1
he promised to cut the deficit in half in his first term			2
he sought in @entity245 in 2009 a " new beginning between the @entity26 and @entity246 around the world			2
" he promised to change the " tone " of @entity249			0
his economic team promised that his $ 800 billion stimulus package would keep the unemployment rate under 8 percent			2
in 2008 , he promised to tackle entitlement reform in his first term			2
before @entity168 was passed @entity28 promised to " cut the cost of a typical family 's premium by up to $ 2,500 a year " and that " if you like your health care plan , you will be able to keep your health care plan			1
" @entity26 realize the president has over-promised and under - delivered			2
the objective record , the multiple failures , and the unkept promises make a profound and fair case against the reelection of @entity28			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity268 .			2

@entity268 *outlines* five reasons @entity28 should not serve a second term
first , he says , @entity28 has not gotten the @entity26 out of its dire economic straits
@entity268 : @entity168 is a costly federal mandate that amounts to huge tax increase
@entity268 : he has broken promises , *bypassed* @entity77 , *mishandled* foreign policy
