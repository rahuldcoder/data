-- a self - professed @entity2 fanatic , @entity3 was looking for a book of photography profiling the company 's products through the years			1
when he did n't find one , the @entity9 software engineer decided to make one himself			1
" iconic : a photographic tribute to @entity13 " is the result			0
released last month , the hardcover , coffee - table book contains 350 pages of photos documenting nearly every product the company has ever made			1
@entity2 has long been unapologetically focused on design and @entity3 , a native of @entity22 , @entity21 , said he wanted to celebrate that with his images			1
" other companies came up with the guts for a machine and then the engineers would find a way to stuff them into a box , " said @entity3			2
" @entity31 started with the box and said , ' you need to find a way to get the guts in			2
' " the book , currently available only through its website , sells for $ 75 , or $ 300 for a special edition which , along with other extras , comes with a custom - fit book case designed in a retro style inspired by @entity2 products of the 1970s and ' 80s			1
it 's all an unlikely project for a software engineer with no formal photography training			0
@entity3 bought new equipment and consulted with a professional as he began the project , which was four years in the making			0
all along , he focused on shooting artistic images that did n't resemble promotional product shots			1
" i did n't want to take photos that you could find in marketing material , " he said			1
instead , he said he approached each shot by looking for an image that would " create that same emotional connection to that product , but maybe does n't look like something you 've seen before			2
" for example , when shooting the first version of the @entity61 , released in 2007 , he chose an image of the back of the phone			0
" i do n't really remember seeing a lot of the photos of the back , " he said			2
" it 's little things like that			0
" @entity3 , who began sharing his images on the website shrine of @entity2 , said he has n't had any official communications with @entity2 about the book			1
" i did n't even try to reach out			0
i knew that it probably would n't get anywhere , " he said			0
" i can tell you there 's been an enormous outpouring of support and enthusiasm from employees			0
people at the company are buying the book -- they 're buying it for themselves , they 're buying it for their friends ...			0
that feedback is obviously very gratifying			0
" no less of an authority than @entity2 co-founder @entity91 wrote a foreword to the book			1
" within these pages , @entity3 presents a thoughtful and artistic gift to @entity2 fans and employees alike ; photographs of @entity2 products -- from hardware to packaging -- the likes of which i 've never seen compiled before , " he writes			1
" @entity3 's passion for this project is reflected on every page , and each honors the hard work of every employee and collaborator that has passed through @entity2 's doors			2
