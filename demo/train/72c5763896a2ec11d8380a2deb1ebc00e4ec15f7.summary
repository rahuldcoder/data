-- when president @entity2 responded to this summer 's torrent of disclosures about the @entity5 by commissioning a review board , some wondered whether waiting for the committee to report its findings would involve a lot of delay and not much in the way of progress			1
but wednesday the panel issued a blockbuster report urging big changes in how the @entity5 does business			1
the recommendations are not perfect , but civil libertarians should embrace many of them , and we are glad that on friday @entity2 said that they are being seriously considered			0
there is no question that all of us will be substantially better off if they are followed			0
consider what the report has to say about the bulk collection of @entity27 ' phone records			2
even among the troubling programs disclosed this summer , this one stood out because of the sheer number of innocent people whose personal information was swept up and its deliberate targeting of @entity27 within the @entity27			0
also striking was the government 's failure to offer any credible evidence that it has made us safer -- even if you are willing to trade liberty for security , you should n't be willing to trade it away for nothing			2
more than that , the call records program squarely raises one of the most fundamental questions about surveillance in the era of big data : should we " collect it all " in case some of it is useful later ? the review board comes very close to rejecting this philosophy of surveillance -- closer than it at first appears : " we recommend that , as a general rule , and without senior policy review , the government should not be permitted to collect and store all mass , undigested , nonpublic personal information about individuals to enable future queries and data - mining for foreign intelligence purposes			1
any program involving government collection or storage of such data must be narrowly tailored to serve an important governmental interest			2
" this is a curious statement			0
on the one hand , the review board does not recommend a complete ban on government mass surveillance programs			1
but on the other , it sets such a high bar for them -- collection and storage must be " narrowly tailored to serve an important governmental interest " -- it is difficult to conceive of a program that would pass muster			2
how can a program of mass surveillance be narrowly tailored ? moreover , lawyers will recognize that this language has been borrowed directly from the @entity89 's " strict scrutiny " standard , which famed constitutional scholar @entity90 once described as " strict in theory and fatal in fact			1
" in other words , while it is theoretically possible to meet this high bar , in practice few laws manage it			0
on the bulk telephone records program specifically , the panel said : " we recommend that legislation should be enacted that terminates the storage of bulk telephone meta - data by the government under @entity107 , and transitions as soon as reasonably possible to a system in which such meta - data is held instead either by private providers or by a private third party			1
" this recommendation does not go far enough , but it is a good start			0
first , the review board acknowledges the two key civil liberties problems with the bulk collection of telephone records : " the record of every telephone call an individual makes or receives over the course of several years can reveal an enormous amount about that individual 's private life , " and " knowing that the government has ready access to one 's phone call records can seriously chill ' associational and expressive freedoms			1
' " ( @entity129 has filed a lawsuit arguing the program violates the constitution for these exact reasons			2
) second , the review board suggests that the government not hold the records , instead favoring a voluntary agreement that carriers will retain the records for some time ( a solution the carriers have already opposed )			0
on the one hand , this is a disappointing half - measure because the privacy and speech intrusions the review board identifies are n't actually eliminated by shifting custody of the records from the government to the carriers			0
the true solution would be for the carriers to retain records only as long as necessary for billing and network maintenance purposes			0
on the other hand , at least the panel is saying clearly that current surveillance practices are in need of major , structural changes			1
if the review board reframes the debate such that government - maintained call records are out of bounds , that is a helpful contribution			0
friday , the president 's expressed willingness to consider ending the @entity5 's collection of phone records , saying , " the question we 're going to have to ask is , can we accomplish the same goals that this program is intended to accomplish in ways that give the public more confidence that in fact the @entity5 is doing what it 's supposed to be doing ? " with this comment and the panel 's report coming on the heels of monday 's remarkable federal court ruling that the bulk collection of telephone records is likely unconstitutional , this has been the best week in a long time for @entity27 ' privacy rights			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			1
