@entity21 was booked after protesting that the @entity24 midfielder had appeared to use his hand to control the ball before smashing in the rebound			0
@entity3 took the lead in the 57th minute with another opportunist goal as midfielder @entity30 netted his second of the season as he nodded in at the far post after @entity1 rose highest to power a header which was destined to go well wide of @entity21 's goal			0
@entity36 , who scored a hat - trick against @entity38 last weekend , wrapped up the victory 11 minutes later when he cut in from the right and surged towards the @entity4 penalty area before slotting in a low left - foot effort			2
