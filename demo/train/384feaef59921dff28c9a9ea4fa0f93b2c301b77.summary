@entity0 , @entity1 -- i pitied the other tourists at the car rental lot at the @entity0 airport : the sight of two englishmen in their mid- 30s sinking uncertainly into a white @entity10 convertible is not pleasant			1
the car was not a natural fit for us			1
it was very low to the ground and had a mystifying set of buttons			1
this meant 20 minutes of painstaking trial and error as we grappled with how to work the roof , as if trying to break the enigma code			1
but as alien as the muscle car was , it was vital to this trip to @entity1 , which was essentially to reclaim lost youth in an early midlife crisis			1
my companion and i had lived in @entity0 after leaving university and were curious to see how it had changed			1
we then planned to drive along the coast to @entity33 , taking in some of @entity1 's wine - growing regions			1
this invited unkind comparisons to the movie " @entity42 , " which sees aging college friends on a road trip drinking wine and navigating disaster			1
@entity43 has some features that can deter tourists : it lacks a natural focal point , is dominated by roadways and has an abundance of depressing motels and fast - food joints			1
it also has @entity53 , a pocket of urban bohemia that has acted as a cultural center for decades			1
developed in 1905 by tobacco millionaire @entity58 , the area derives its name from the canals built to drain off the marshland			1
it was conceived as a family beach resort but fell into neglect			1
as real estate prices dropped , the area began to attract an eclectic mix of people			2
this instilled that bohemian dna into @entity53 , which served as a rallying point for the @entity73 in the 1950s and remains an important artistic center			2
10 top road trip apps much of @entity53 has hardly changed			1
the chaotic beachfront boardwalk is alive and well : tattoo artists , head shops and fortune - tellers hawk their wares to a stream of human traffic , even in winter			2
we stayed in a free - wheeling art deco style hotel that looked like it had not changed in 40 years			2
elsewhere , there are signs of inevitable gentrification			2
the memory of @entity53 's developer is preserved in @entity92 , a mile - long artery and focal point for residents and local businesses			2
i walked down the palm - lined street every day when i lived in @entity53 and always enjoyed its offbeat charm			2
it was a relief to see the hipsterish local coffee bar @entity102 was still dosing the population and exhibiting local art. but around it , stylish galleries , boutiques and swanky condos now give the road a feeling of imposing wealth , resembling @entity114 's @entity113 district -- certainly the chic end of boho - chic			1
the neighborhood has become safer and cleaner , said @entity118 , owner of @entity119			2
gang - related activity has dropped , and " what you have now are some of the most influential , creative , progressive and cutting - edge people living within a couple mile radius in one small beach community , " @entity118 said			2
" when my wife and i first moved to @entity53 over 13 years ago , @entity58 felt like a ghost town , " he said			2
perhaps the most dramatic change was seeing the property where i once lived in harder times			2
once a teeming human zoo of chancers and borderline personalities , the three houses have been divided and sold			2
the rough neighborhood is now transformed into a quiet and sunny residential street			0
i would happily move back			0
feeling considerably older already , we began the " @entity42 " leg of the journey			0
channeling the film , the car 's top was lowered and we took off along the ravishing @entity144			0
hugging @entity1 's coastline for 655 miles , the road offers the serenity and endless vastness of the @entity149 as a backdrop			1
the terrain changes as you head north , taking in plains , craggy headlands and lush green hills that tumble down into the sea			0
all our heightened expectations were met and rewarded			0
an hour after leaving @entity0 , we reached @entity158			1
long overshadowed by the @entity160 region farther north , @entity158 was put on the wine tourist 's map by the release of the @entity165 - winning film in 2004			1
" its timing created a tsunami of interest , " says @entity168 of the @entity169			0
" recognition in not only @entity158 , but wine in general , more specifically , @entity175 , which flourishes in @entity158			1
" with mountain ranges running horizontally across the county , @entity158 channels ocean air into its valleys and has a cool climate			0
this geographical oddity makes it a natural home for @entity175 grapes , which can ripen too early in warmer temperatures			0
as one " @entity42 " character explains in loving tones : " it 's not a survivor like @entity189 , which can just grow anywhere and uh , thrive even when it 's neglected			0
no , @entity175 needs constant care and attention			0
you know ? and in fact it can only grow in these really specific , little , tucked - away corners of the world			0
" at first , the region struggled to cope with the surge in interest generated by the film : tasting rooms were hastily built on vineyards , leading to a jump in sales			0
by 2008 , wine makers were selling directly to customers some eight times as much as they were selling in 2000			1
@entity158 is a natural target for a day trip from @entity0 and has the inevitable " @entity42 " tour guide for visitors , which generated geekish excitement			1
we took in a few gems : the @entity218 motel boasting a looming windmill and mock @entity221 facade ; @entity222 , which gives you the bizarre opportunity of feeding hungry flocks ; and a vineyard which features in one memorable scene			0
i am far from an oracle on wine , but it 's not hard to enjoy the distinctly civilized process of tasting			1
visitors to @entity236 gather at a bar featured in the movie and pay $ 10 to taste eight wines			0
they can be a mix of red and white and each measure gives the drinker several sips			0
at the vineyard , we sampled @entity247 , @entity248 and a blend of @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252			0
tastings are also an inducement to buy bottles , which start at around $ 15 and provide estates with their main source of profit			0
our final destination was on a grander scale altogether : the @entity160 and @entity262 valleys north of @entity33			1
here , you get the idea of a real industry geared around global exports as much as local sales			0
there are some 400 wineries in the region , so the visitor can feel overwhelmed on first arrival			0
we opted to plan our itinerary on the discerning basis of which vineyards offered two - for - one tasting deals			0
most tourists are not averse to sampling wine in the morning , and our first stop took us to @entity281 , which claims to be the oldest winery in the region			1
revealingly , it has been recently taken over by a @entity285 brand			0
the scenery around the valleys is reliably lovely year - round			0
in fall , the countryside turns a languid golden color , with neatly ordered rows of vineyards set off by the surrounding hills			1
driving slowly in the late autumn sun was almost a religious obligation , despite the ensuing tailbacks			0
on my return flight , i resolved to plan a series of similar midlife crises for years to come .			0

two englishmen in their thirties hit the road in a @entity10 convertible
the pair are exploring @entity1 wine country a la " *sideways* "
the trip spans the countryside and coast from @entity0 to @entity33
