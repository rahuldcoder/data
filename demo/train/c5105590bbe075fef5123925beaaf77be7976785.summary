@entity0 -- a wealthy mayor from @entity3 has been arrested in @entity4 for allegedly offering to pay $ 55,000 to poor people to obtain liver tissue for his liver transplant , police and a government official announced wednesday			1
it 's the first time that potential human organ trafficking , a worrisome international crime , has been detected in @entity4 , authorities said			2
the mayor , a 61 - year - old man , was arrested on january 30 at @entity16 in @entity17			1
he has since appeared before a judge , who filed preliminary charges for alleged organ trafficking and released him on condition that he surrender his passport and remain in @entity4 , police and the official said at a @entity0 news conference			2
authorities , including @entity4 's director general of national police , would not name the mayor because of an ongoing court investigation			1
nor would they release the names of his alleged accomplices -- three @entity3 and a @entity36 who also were arrested in @entity4			2
" the police have helped to fight one of the scars of the 21st century , which is organ trafficking , " @entity38 , director of the government 's @entity39 , said at the news conference			0
" it 's the first case that we have detected in @entity4 , of some people who come from foreign countries and who try to get some poor people , some immigrants , " to sell a piece of their liver for a transplant , @entity38 said			1
the mayor 's alleged accomplices recruited and later paid for nine poor people -- eight immigrants and a @entity60 -- to have specialized liver compatibility tests at a clinic in @entity17 last summer , police say			1
the combined tests cost $ 16,000 , which the mayor 's aides allegedly paid			2
some of the nine people also received small sums of money for taking part , police said			0
just one man , a @entity73 immigrant , met the medical criteria for the liver tissue removal and , posing as a legitimate donor , he accompanied the @entity3 mayor last summer to a @entity79 clinic that specializes in liver transplants			1
but medical workers there , following strict protocols against human organ trafficking , prevented it			0
@entity4 is considered a world leader in legal organ transplants , and under its rules , human donors must do so only for altruistic reasons and must be family members or close friends of the recipient			0
the hospital quickly discovered that the @entity73 immigrant and the @entity3 mayor had no such relationship , authorities said			0
the mayor eventually got his liver transplant in @entity79 , using tissue donated by his son , who had earlier been turned down as a donor in @entity3 , @entity4 authorities said			1
but in @entity17 , police were already investigating a tip from a nongovernmental organization that works with immigrants , which reported that an @entity110 woman had complained that people were offering her money for part of her liver			1
the @entity110 woman was among the nine people who eventually took the liver compatibility tests			1
further investigation into the people who were recruiting and paying for those tests led police to the @entity3 mayor , and to the @entity3 suspects and the @entity36 , who live in @entity4 , authorities said			1
the mayor 's arrest occurred when he flew back to @entity4 for a medical checkup			2
the suspects could face 12 years in prison if convicted , but the court 's investigation is still preliminary , with no indictments , which are a necessary step before any trial can be held			0
" the main message is that no country is totally free of this problem , so that everybody should be alert , " @entity38 said			0
" organ trafficking is more or less like slaves of some centuries ago			0
it 's the way some people really control other people			0
it 's exploitation of human beings			0
