-- it 's a dilemma 1960s tv character @entity3 knew well : " how do you stand out when you 're the middle sister ? " indeed , her ranting against sophisticated elder sibling -- " @entity7 , @entity7 , @entity7 " -- became one of the most memorable catchphrases in the long - running @entity11 sitcom @entity12			1
but the middle sister need n't be overlooked			2
in fact , if the @entity15 -- the second horse race in @entity11 's prestigious @entity17 -- is anything to go by , sometimes the quiet ones have the greatest stories to tell			1
the @entity21 may be the first and most famous of the trifecta -- won by mud - splattered jockey @entity24 atop thoroughbred @entity25 earlier this month			1
but the @entity15 , which is run in @entity26 this saturday , also offers a fascinating history , unique atmosphere , and special significance in the march towards the third race in the crown , the @entity33			1
here are five fun reasons why the @entity15 is one to watch : silver service the trophy is so valuable , not even the winners are allowed to hold it			1
the mammoth 13 - kilogram , solid silver @entity39 , created by @entity41 in 1860 , is worth $ 1 million -- making it the most valuable trophy in @entity11 sports			1
but the immense pressure of safeguarding it for an entire year was too much for the wife of 1953 's winning owner @entity48 , who instead convinced her husband to leave it the hands of organizers			2
the trophy now remains on permanent display at the @entity54 , with winners instead given a $ 30,000 replica trophy			2
blooming ingenious sometimes if nature wo n't bloom , you 've just got to paint it yourself			0
so it goes for the iconic " @entity64 " blanket , traditionally draped across the shoulders of the winning horse			2
the blanket takes three days to create , featuring 80 bunches of normal yellow daisies strung together and attached to a rubber base , with the underside covered in thick felt			0
but because the @entity64 -- the official flower for the state of @entity73 -- does n't sprout until june , artists must instead paint the center of the daisies black			0
you 're so ' vane ' the paintwork continues atop @entity79 's @entity78 , where each year the weather vane is daubed in the winner 's colors			0
as soon as the race is over , the 1.5 - meter wide weather vane , featuring a miniature horse and jockey , is painted in the winning jockey 's silks			1
the unusual tradition started in 1909 after the building 's original arrow - shaped weather vane was struck by lightning and replaced with the ornamental iron rider			0
sign painter @entity94 took on the job in 1987 , saying : " it is just the thrill of being able to participate in a big local and national event like this			0
let 's face it , it 's the only televised sign - painting job in the country			0
" family ties if ever there was a big daddy of @entity15 , @entity105 is it			2
the champion thoroughbred not only won the @entity11 @entity17 in 1930 , he went on to sire the winners of more than 90 @entity15			1
it was a case of like father like son , when @entity105 's offspring , @entity115 , also won the @entity17 in 1935			2
@entity105 won 11 of his 17 races , before retiring at the grand old age of three			0
the super stud died in 1954 , aged 27			0
race adjourned still looking for proof that @entity15 is a race that stops a nation ? look no further than the day it brought @entity126 to a standstill			1
the @entity11 @entity128 adjourned for the only time in history in 1877 , to watch what was known as the " @entity131			1
" more than 20,000 people flocked to @entity79 to watch three thoroughbreds -- parole , @entity135 and @entity136 -- battle it out on the field			0
six - year - old gelding parole triumphed , and local pool halls saloons and baseball clubs were renamed in his honor .			0

@entity15 , second race in @entity11 @entity17 , starts saturday
