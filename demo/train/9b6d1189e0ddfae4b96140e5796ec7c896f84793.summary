a new report by the @entity2 legislative committee investigating gov. @entity4 's involvement in the @entity6 controversy shows an inconsistency between a top aide 's sworn testimony and phone records			1
national democrats quickly seized on the development as proof that @entity4 and his aides have stonewalled the investigation , even as the 136 - page report failed to find any conclusive evidence tying @entity4 to the scandal			1
and a top @entity2 @entity20 vowed the investigation would continue			0
in july , @entity22 , a senior @entity4 aide , told the legislative panel investigating @entity6 that she texted @entity4 during a key committee hearing last year and did not recall getting a response from the governor			1
but phone records show that it was @entity4 who texted @entity30 before the two traded a dozen messages during the hearing , according to a copy of the report obtained by @entity36			1
the text messages were deleted before the committee could review them , but the report shows @entity22 's sworn testimony was not accurate			1
related : @entity6 panel co-chair : " we are not done " the report is inconclusive on what @entity4 knew about last year 's lane closings that snarled traffic on the @entity47			1
@entity4 has denied knowing anything about the lane closures until they were over			2
on dec. 9 last year , the state @entity50 heard testimony from three @entity54 officials and @entity30 monitored the hearing , @entity22 told the investigative committee in july			0
she said she texted the governor to tell him the @entity54 officials ' testimony was professional and that she did not recall getting a response from @entity4			1
but according to the report , @entity30 's phone records show that @entity4 texted her during the officials ' testimony and the texting continued throughout the hearing			1
" this is taking place on dec. 9			0
this is taking place several days before the governor makes his press statement on dec. 13 that he did n't know anything about this issue , " said @entity67 , the @entity68 co-chair of the investigative committee			1
he added , " you know ( the texts are ) relevant to the investigation			0
you know the committee is going to want to look at them			0
to delete them and claim it was in the ordinary course of business strains credibility			0
it 's just not believable			0
" a @entity4 spokesman declined to comment , pointing instead to what the governor said about the issue in august			2
" i have no recollection of her even sending me a text , " he said			0
" it obviously was something of no moment or no import because i have no recollection of it at all			0
" the governor 's office also released a statement from @entity102 , the attorney @entity4 hired to do an internal investigation			2
" @entity104 has finally acknowledged what we reported nine months ago -- namely , that there is not a shred of evidence governor @entity4 knew anything about the @entity47 lane realignment beforehand or that any current member of his staff was involved in that decision , " he said			2
" @entity104 's work has simply corroborated our comprehensive investigation			0
