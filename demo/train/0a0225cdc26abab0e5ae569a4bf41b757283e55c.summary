@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 on wednesday narrowly defeated a proposal to sharply restrict the @entity6 's phone surveillance program that was exposed by @entity7			1
the @entity11 administration and @entity2 speaker @entity12 , unlikely allies in the sharp partisan climate in @entity0 , joined forces to reject the limit offered as an amendment to a defense spending bill , 217 - 205			1
a coalition of libertarian , liberal and conservative lawmakers pushed for curbs on the blanket collection of those records , arguing that it was too broad and intrusive			1
@entity7 , a former @entity6 contractor , revealed details of the bulk phone tracking effort and a companion e-mail collection initiative through leaks of classified information to media outlets last month			1
he has been charged with espionage			0
since then , a number of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have been highly critical of the sweeping way in which the government applies telephone surveillance that is overseen by a secret court			1
they and privacy groups concluded the government had reached too far into the personal lives of @entity3 in the interests of national security			0
rep. @entity43 , a @entity45 @entity44 who sits on the @entity47 , said during debate on the amendment that the @entity6 had exceeded its mandate			1
he said the measure would have halted surveillance of people not under direct investigation by authorities			1
" the time has come to stop it , " he said			0
but rep. @entity58 said approval would have effectively killed the program , which he said has been found constitutional and approved by bipartisan majorities			1
" folks , we are at war , " said @entity58 , an @entity62 @entity44 and @entity64 veteran who urged his colleagues not to undermine the surveillance tool he said was critical for troops in the field in counterterrorism operations			2
unusual alliances the proposal forged alliances among bitter political rivals on @entity74			2
it even prompted an unusual tactical move by the @entity2 to weigh in on an amendment vote before debate , saying the proposal was hasty and blunt and would dismantle a counterterrorism tool			2
@entity2 @entity44 leaders tried several ways to stave off a vote , but agreed under pressure from many conservatives eager for public debate			0
a breakdown of the tally showed 134 @entity88 voting with 83 @entity89 to reject the measure offered by the @entity92 odd couple of sophomore @entity93 rep. @entity93 and 25 - term @entity89 rep @entity94			1
@entity12 , who as speaker rarely votes on the @entity2 floor , opposed it as did @entity99 @entity98			0
but 94 @entity88 and 111 @entity89 supported it			0
@entity93 told reporters his amendment was " about the @entity3 people versus the elites in @entity0			0
" he maintained that @entity6 program represented " a clear violation " of @entity108 protections regarding warrants			1
@entity93 said he was simply working to ensure the government was following the original intent of the @entity112 , the anti-terror law that authorized increased government surveillance powers after 9/11			2
@entity88 argued against the measure , with chairs of the @entity117 , @entity47 , and @entity119 committees circulating a letter saying it would have " unintended consequences for the intelligence and law enforcement communities			2
" national security pressure national security officials personally appealed to @entity2 members , hoping to derail the vote			0
they have said phone and e-mail surveillance have helped thwart terror plots			1
president @entity11 also has stressed that the @entity6 was not using the surveillance program to listen in on phone calls ; that it only collected metadata , including numbers , times of calls and dates			1
@entity138 , the nation 's top intelligence official , released a statement before the vote noting that he had joined others in opposing the measure			2
@entity146 @entity89 rep @entity144 , a critic of the original provisions on data collection in the @entity112 , said he was n't persuaded by the warnings from the administration			0
he voted for the amendment			0
" i never dreamed it would ever be used for dragnet surveillance of every @entity3 phone call , even if only for metadata			1
and frankly that 's way beyond what @entity157 intended , " he said			0
the @entity159 , a conservative think tank often cited by @entity88 , released an analysis that warned the amendment would " increase the risks of terrorist attacks by limiting the scope of court - ordered foreign intelligence collection and thereby depriving the @entity3 of valuable intelligence it currently collects			2
" but at a monthly forum sponsored by @entity159 that features some of the @entity2 's most conservative members , that argument did n't sway many members			0
eight of the nine lawmakers on the wednesday panel , which included @entity93 , said they planned to vote for it			2
rep @entity177 , a leader of the tea party movement on @entity74 , broke with fellow conservative lawmakers , saying the @entity6 program collects phone records from telecommunications companies not individuals , so there is " no expectation of privacy			1
" a member of the @entity189 , @entity177 warned that " if we take this program and remove from the @entity3 the distinct advantage we have versus any other country it would be those that would be seeking to achieve the goals of @entity197 who will benefit from by putting the @entity3 at risk			2
" the defense spending bill now moves to the @entity201 , but that chamber has not considered its version yet in committee or scheduled a floor vote			0
but in the @entity201 , there is little support for making major changes to the @entity6 program			1
before the vote @entity144 said even this amendment failed he and other opponents of the program would continue to press for changes			0
" it simply will not be renewed when it expires in 2015			0
it 's going to end - now or later			0
the only question is when and on what terms			0
" court renews secret @entity3 surveillance program @entity219 to feds : disclose your data requests			1

lawmakers were outraged by sweeping way in which phone surveillance applied
proposal attached to defense funding measure was defeated 217 - 205
