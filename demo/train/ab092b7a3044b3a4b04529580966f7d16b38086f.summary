@entity2 , @entity3 @entity0 used his final public address as @entity6 governor on friday to sharply criticize president @entity8 's stewardship of the country and called on fellow @entity10 to articulate a plan to voters explaining how the @entity10 will turn the country around			1
" what is needed at this time in history is a clear vision for the world with @entity20 leading again , and freedom on the march again , " @entity0 said friday afternoon in a speech to the @entity15			1
" what is on the ballot in 2016 is a choice whether we are going to ... rise to the challenge of defending @entity29 values or accept the decline of @entity29 civilization , because those who had the most to lose did the least to preserve freedom			0
" @entity0 , who delivered his remarks from behind a podium , reading from prepared notes , was at times halting in his speech			1
but he delivered heaps of political red meat to the state party leaders and activists sitting in the audience			1
not once did @entity0 , who is considering a possible @entity45 run , mention any of his possible opponents for the @entity15 nomination during his speech , and he refrained from doing so when he spoke afterward to reporters			1
" i 'm not going to go back and rehash the 2012 campaign , " @entity0 said when asked what was @entity51 's biggest mistake as presidential nominee			1
" i am not sure that is particularly of great utility			0
we need to be talking about the future and laying out a good bright vision for this country and how to get people back working again , how to get @entity61 to focus on the few things it needs to do and do rather well			0
get our foreign policy back to where our allies know we are going to be standing with them and our enemies fear us			0
that is what we need to focus on			0
" @entity0 sidestepped a direct question about what type of candidate @entity51 would be if he decided to seek the @entity10 nomination again			2
" whenever someone becomes a certified official candidate i 'd be more comfortable making a statement about him , " @entity0 said			2
" i think whether it is @entity78 [ @entity77 ] , or it is @entity51 or whoever it might be , adding quality people to the field raises the level			0
" in his speech , @entity0 did not necessarily present policy solutions , but rather critiques of @entity8 on everything from the president 's handling of the economy and energy policy to foreign affairs			2
the @entity6 governor specifically chastised @entity8 for failing to travel to @entity94 for a unity march that drew leaders from around the world , who came come together to condemn the slaying of 12 people by terrorists at @entity102 magazine			2
" when leaders of the world gather to stand against terrorism , the president of the @entity20 needs to be there and he needs to be standing in the front of that march , " @entity0 said			2
@entity0 did highlight the @entity6 economy and held it up as an example of how jobs should be created and copied throughout the nation			1
" our formula for success is simple : keep taxes low , implement smart regulations , " he said			0
" you have an educated workforce and stop lawsuit abuse at the courthouse			0
" before heading into a private reception to meet people attending the @entity15 's @entity126 , @entity0 , who is leaving office in a few days , was asked what his next job would be			1
" i will call you when i get that all figured out , " he said .			0

*outgoing* @entity6 gov. @entity0 speaks to the @entity15
he delivers plenty of red meat to his audience , but gives no clues about his 2016 plans
