-- the military operation to clear a @entity4 slum of drug traffickers will effectively turn into an occupation of the area at least through october of next year , gov. @entity1 said in a radio interview tuesday			1
@entity4 state gov. @entity1 said that at least 2,000 troops will remain at the @entity3 -- called a favela in @entity11 -- to keep up the effort to pacify the area			1
he announced the move after meeting with @entity15 , @entity16 's president - elect , in the capital , @entity18			2
originally , he had requested the troops for only six months			1
@entity15 offered her support for the security work being carried out in @entity4 , @entity1 said			2
the troops are needed so that the government does n't have to delay future operations in other communities overrun by drug traffickers , he said			1
the troops will remain until a police unit and station are installed in @entity3 , slated for the middle of next year			1
@entity16 , which will host the @entity30 in 2014 and the @entity31 in 2016 , is under increasing pressure to crack down on violent crime and clean up its slums			1
over the weekend , armored vehicles followed by police trucks rolled into the favela to restore order			1
the police to be placed are known as @entity40 , a special force designed to live and work in the favelas they protect			1
such units are already in operations in some favelas , but this most recent operation is the most ambitious to date			1
authorities have been trying to dislodge traffickers from their hiding places for two years , but the operation in @entity3 is the first time the government has tried to regain territory run by the criminals in earnest , said @entity57 , director of the @entity58 at the @entity59			1
at the outset , the events appear to be a victory for the government , but winning over the locals , who were living under the rule and services of the traffickers , will be a challenge			1
" this is just the beginning			2
[ @entity69 ] will have to work with people to convince them that you will not abuse their rights , " @entity57 said			2
that is the goal of the @entity69			2
reaction inside and outside @entity16 to the success of the current operation has been positive , with speculation that the country is trying to clean up its streets before the @entity30 and @entity31 come to town			1
@entity57 , however , suggests that it is domestic pressure that is leading to police work			1
as a whole , @entity16 's economy is growing , and so is the middle class			0
as people find themselves in better situations , they also begin to demand better quality of life , @entity57 said			0
people want things like better education and security			0
" this , i think , is what created the pressure to try to find new solutions for a very old problem , " he said			2
the slums became dangerous places during a period when the city and state of @entity4 had poor government , something that was exploited during the drug boom in the 1980s , @entity57 said			0
conversely , one of the factors behind the efficient action today is the fact that the local and state leaders are from the same political party and are allies with the federal government , said @entity117 , executive director of the @entity118 at @entity119			0
while @entity16 as a whole is doing well , economic and social indicators in the city of @entity4 have lagged , @entity117 said			0
this is significant because @entity4 is often seen as a representation of @entity16 as a whole			0
" this is n't @entity127			0
what happens here does n't stay here , " he said			2
the perception is that " if this iconic city is undergoing social chaos , how can it be that @entity16 is a @entity135 ? " @entity117 said , referring to the designation given to rapidly rising countries of @entity16 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			0
the @entity30 and @entity31 may be an impetus for acting now , but the pressure comes from @entity4 's need to reflect the better side of @entity16 , he said			2
whatever the reason for the incursion and occupation of @entity3 , residents there are optimistic about the future			1
" we have already weathered many difficult situations here , but thank @entity154 things improved , " said @entity151 , a retiree			0
@entity155 , a maid , said , " we lived a very repressed life			0
now we have more freedom			0
we can come and go			0
this is important not just for me but for everyone here			0
" journalist @entity161 in @entity4 contributed to this report .			0
