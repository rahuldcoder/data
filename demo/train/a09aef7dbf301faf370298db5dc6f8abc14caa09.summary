from the ramparts of @entity36 , the allure of this place is evident in every direction -- from the labyrinth of crooked streets to endless sparkle of the @entity43			0
by day , lose yourself in historical stories of blood and bombast ; by night , float along in crowds of giggling tourists , rowdy locals and syncopated salsa rhythms			2
@entity52 : around the world in 5 signature drinks 2			0
beaches this -- the rub of sand between the toes , the brilliant sparkle of turquoise water and rhythmic shush of cresting waves , maybe the patter of your favorite record in the headphones -- endows a visit to @entity1 with the qualities of daydream			1
from the golden , crescent - shaped heaven of @entity82 ( considered among the world 's best beaches ) , coconut oil - scented crowds of @entity1 's little slice of @entity75 , @entity76 , and the secluded , mangrove - shaded hideaways in the south to the roaring surf of the west , @entity1 's unending beaches are dreamy			1

the bioluminescent waters in the bays of @entity107 reveal the phenomenon at its most fantastic			0
catch some béisbol the bleachers at island béisbol ( baseball ) stadiums reveal a lot more than nine - innings of play -- it 's a vantage on the fickle @entity4 love affair with baseball			0
@entity1 's zeal for the sport may never fill the oversized stadiums that dot the island , but the low - key games and dirt cheap tickets get béisbol fans right up in the action			1
expect to witness a face off between upstart farm leaguers looking for their big shot and fading stars of the @entity133 looking to go out in a blaze of glory			0
rum cocktails at sunset if there 's an elixir to help those sunsets imprint your memory forever , it likely comes in a tall , cold glass			1
from the piña coladas with toy umbrellas to the everyman 's @entity150 ( rum and @entity145 with a wedge of lime ) you 'd be remiss to leave ' @entity152 ' without savoring a rum cocktail during a spectacular sunset			1

@entity52 : @entity52 's voyages of a lifetime 6			0
swimming & snorkeling many of the island 's most marvelous places for snorkeling and swimming lie out of the heavily traveled tourist corridors , on satellite islands off the main island 's east or south coast and coral reefs in the southwest			0
in the morning , waters off these areas are crystal clear and usually calm enough to paddle around for hours enjoying visibility up to 75 feet			0
and what a view -- expect a riot of brightly colored fish , coral formations and , if you 're lucky , a lazy ray			0
the consistency clear waters of @entity188 , off the island 's west coast , also top any divers ' wish list			0
museums of @entity194 @entity194 , the so - called ' @entity195 , ' boasts a wealth of museums with enough diversity to satisfy the most intellectually rapacious museum hunter			2

cuisine in @entity27 's @entity209 when cruise ships shimmer like floating cities at the docks just off shore , the world - class restaurants of @entity209 ( short for ' @entity215 , ' naturally ) rise to the occasion , impressing their international audiences with the most inventive plates of fine dining in the @entity4			1
recent years have seen a revolving door of hot restaurants in this corner of @entity27 , but only the most creative survive			2
expect the traditional , elemental essence of @entity1 flavors fused with preparations from across the globe			2
colonial architecture if you tried to savor every single example of colonial grandeur -- all the fountains and historic squares , every dignified plantation house or buttressed 19th - century town hall -- @entity1 's architecture gems would demand a month - long stay			1
but , if nothing else outside of @entity27 earns time on your agenda , take a stroll around the @entity241 in @entity207 , a place downright littered with statues , lined by colonial edifices , and crowned by the regal @entity245 ( a rescued relic from the 1939 @entity247 )			1
@entity248 tropical rainforest the lush forests , verdant hills and crashing waterfalls of @entity248 are the only true rainforests in the @entity254 , a place to embark on a short hike through the oxygen - rich mist , explore waterfalls and gawk at @entity261 - sized ferns			1
you will get wet , so bring a raincoat , but bring binoculars too ; of the 26 species found here and nowhere else in the world , you 'll want to keep a sharp eye out for the @entity1 parrot , one of the 10 most endangered birds on earth			2
