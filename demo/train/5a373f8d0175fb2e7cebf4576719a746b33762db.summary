@entity0 -- a misguided photo shoot of @entity3 over @entity4 in 2009 terrified residents , infuriated the president , and cost the director of the @entity8 his job			1
now , @entity10 is working to prevent a similar panic in @entity0 @entity10 officials this week announced plans for a new mission to monitor air pollution in the @entity17 - @entity0 traffic corridor that will include a series of low - altitude flights between the two cities			1
trying to prevent a repeat of the chaos raised in @entity4 , they are eager to get the word out to the public			0
@entity25 , spokesman for the @entity26 , says that @entity10 is publicizing the flights to generate awareness and to make sure people " wo n't be surprised			1
" " public safety is paramount , " he said			0
@entity10 plans to use a @entity31 , a 117 - foot , four - engine turboprop plane , for flights that will be as low as 1,000 feet			1
the lower of the two aircraft will fly in spirals over several ground measurement stations along the flight path , which includes @entity38 and crosses over the @entity39			0
the other aircraft will fly at around 26,000 feet			0
the flights are scheduled to start no earlier than june 27 and go through july			0
working with federal and state environmental agencies on this analysis , @entity10 says the flights are critical			2
all flights will be posted on the @entity10 website the night before takeoff			2
" for some of these pollutant gases , the satellites are not as effective in detecting the quantities near the ground as they are at higher altitudes , " @entity48 , a project scientist explained			0
low - flying aircraft will help answer questions about existing data , and will provide " a complete picture of air quality over the @entity17 - @entity0 region , " @entity48 said			1
potential benefits from the research are not limited to @entity0			2
@entity48 said that these experiments " will help @entity10 design a next generation of air - quality satellites " leading to analyses for cities across the country , so that " ultimately public health can be better protected			1
" flights are scheduled in @entity71 next , in 2013 , and could be followed by flights in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 or @entity76			0
so if you 're in the @entity0 area over the next month , and happen to catch a glimpse of a startlingly low @entity10 aircraft -- do n't hold your breath			1
in fact , @entity10 is hoping the new study will help everyone breathe easier .			0

@entity10 planes will sample @entity0 - @entity88 air
agency is *worried* low flights could cause undue *concern*
mission essential to *gather* data , agency says
@entity0 area to be sampled first
