-- it is a well known fact that during times of war , women are often subjected to increased sexual violence			1
less well known is that the same is true for men			0
sexual violence against men is not limited to any particular part of the world			1
it 's not confined to a state 's armed forces or to rebel groups			0
victims are civilians as well as detained soldiers			0
perpetrators are male and female , and the sexual violence comes in different forms			1
when the words " sexual violence " are mentioned , most people instinctively think of rape			1
while men are indeed raped , they are also subjected to a whole host of other atrocities			0
in some wars , castration is prevalent ; in others , male detainees are stripped of their clothes and forced to remain naked ; in still others , beating of the genitals is commonplace			0
male victims have also been forced to rape other victims , sometimes even members of their own family			1
take the civil war that is currently going on in @entity41			1
there have been numerous reports of sexual violence , including sexual violence against men			1
just last month , the @entity48 @entity47 reported that sexual violence was being perpetrated against men and women in detention centers			1
in an earlier report , the @entity47 noted instances of rape , electric shocks to the genitals and forced rape of family members			0
and @entity41 is just one example			0
research has shown that sexual violence has been committed against men in dozens of wars			1
in the last few years alone , there have been reports of wartime sexual violence against men , for example in the @entity70 and the @entity71 , as well as in situations of instability , for example in the 2007 - 2008 post-election violence in @entity76			2
only a few studies have been undertaken on the subject , but the results of these are astonishing			0
one study , published in the @entity82 , found that 32.6 % of the adult male combatants surveyed in the @entity85 conflict had experienced sexual violence			2
another study , this time relating to the eastern part of the @entity70 , found that 23.6 % of the men surveyed reported experiencing sexual violence , of which 64.5 % were exposed to conflict - related sexual violence			1
not all conflicts will generate such high numbers , but even lower figures should be worrying			0
indeed , there is likely an underreporting of male wartime sexual violence , akin to the underreporting of sexual violence generally			2
this is due to the shame , fear , guilt and stigma felt by victims			0
despite the prevalence of sexual violence against men for many years , the silence on the issue has been deafening			2
in the last decade or so , there has been some limited progress			0
today , there is often acknowledgment that men are subjected to sexual violence during wartime , and there are occasional media reports on the subject			1
in official reports , however , all too often , the issue is mentioned only in passing or is relegated to a footnote -- and the principal @entity48 resolution on the subject focuses on female victims of sexual violence almost to the exclusion of male victims			1
relatively few resources exist to assist male victims , with some organizations limiting their programs to female victims alone			1
and there have been very few prosecutions involving sexual violence of men before international criminal tribunals			2
the issue of wartime sexual violence generally has long been neglected			2
things have started to change in recent years			0
however , attention has tended to focus on sexual violence against women and girls			2
that is an incredibly important issue , but it is imperative that other victims are not left behind			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			0

male victims of sexual violence during war are less well known than female victims
men are subjected to other atrocities as well as rape , says @entity152
@entity41 's civil war is just one example of where such crimes have been reported
research shows men have been victimized in dozens of wars , says @entity152
