@entity0 -- @entity3 officials head to federal court on monday to defend a controversial new voter identification law , dismissing suggestions the requirement would deny tens of thousands of people , many of them minorities , access to the ballot			1

it is one of several legal challenges to voter identification laws nationwide			1

state officials have deflected criticism the legal battle could end up costing taxpayers $ 1 million or more			0

a decision in the case could take weeks			0
in legal filings with the court , @entity3 officials said a law dating to 1988 requires a state - issued voter registration card and the voter 's signature at the polls			1
the amended law approved last year would permit five types of photo identification : a state - issued driver 's license , a non-driver identification card issued by the @entity89 , military identification , a @entity69 passport , or state voter registration card			1
waivers are allowed , but the voter must sign an affidavit specifying why she or he has a " reasonable impediment " to getting the necessary identification or has a religious objection to being photographed			0
if the law takes effect , @entity3 would be among 11 states that require official photo identification at the polls , according to the @entity105			1
proponents say the drive is an effort to stop what officials contend is voter fraud and to purge voter rolls of outdated information			1
supporters say having valid , government - issued photo identification is a reasonable , modern - day necessity			0

" @entity3 's photo id measure is a solution in search of a problem			2
credible studies show that one is more likely to be struck by lightning than to perceive an instance of in - person voter fraud , " @entity141 , a top lawyer at the @entity143 's @entity142 , said			2
" the [ upcoming ] trial will make clear that the state 's proposed photo identification measure will have a significant impact on its minority voters			0

a federal trial was held last month and a ruling is expected soon			0
