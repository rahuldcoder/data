should police officers wear cameras to document their activities while on duty ? the notion has been around for a while			1
but since august 's fatal shooting of @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 -- for which witness accounts varied widely -- it 's gained traction to become part of the national conversation about police conduct			1
the idea is that a video camera mounted on an officer 's vest or uniform would provide an accurate , objective account of every encounter with a civilian			1
ideally , the camera would discourage police misconduct while protecting officers against unfounded civil complaints of brutality or corruption			2
some police associations support the idea , and even the @entity35 administration is backing it			2
since august , more than 150,000 people have signed a petition on the @entity39 's website urging that all state , county and local police be required to wear a camera			2
in response , deputy assistant to the president @entity44 expressed support for the proposal while saying the @entity49 is researching the best way to implement video technology into daily policing			0
as @entity44 noted , a 2013 report by the @entity49 found that " both officers and civilians acted in a more positive manner when they were aware that a camera was present			0
" of course , body cameras create some thorny privacy issues , such as whether police need consent to videotape activities on private property			2
some officers also view the cameras as unwanted scrutiny and a sign that their supervisors do n't trust them			1
and the fact that a witness used a phone camera to record @entity74 police arresting @entity75 in july did n't prevent the injuries that led to @entity75 's death a short time later , nor did the footage lead to indictments for the officers involved			1
still , among the police departments that have experimented with officer - worn cameras , early results have been encouraging			0
a 2013 study found that public complaints against police officers in @entity87 , @entity88 , plunged after the city 's 54 frontline officers began wearing video cameras			1
use of force by @entity87 officers also declined in the months after the cameras were introduced			0
other police departments across the @entity97 are also now testing body cameras			0
amid protests following the lack of indictments in the @entity75 case , @entity74 mayor @entity99 announced in december that his police department was accelerating efforts to equip all its officers with body cameras as well			1
" when something happens , to have a video record of it from the police officer 's perspective , it 's going to help in many , many ways , " @entity99 said			0
" it 's going to improve the work of law enforcement			0
and @entity120 forbid , when something goes wrong , we 're going to have a clear understanding of what happened and whatever approaches we need to take as a result			0

some believe police should wear video cameras to document *interactions* with *suspects*
the idea has gained traction since the fatal shooting of @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12
cameras could provide evidence for *prosecutions* , but some officers do n't like the extra scrutiny
