on monday night at the @entity2 / @entity1 @entity0 in @entity3 , @entity4 , gov. @entity5 of @entity6 suggested that he could n't be bought for a campaign contribution of $ 5,000			1
that raises the question : is there a price at which @entity5 's loyalty is for sale ? during the debate , @entity18 founder and fellow presidential hopeful rep. @entity15 , @entity16 , alleged that campaign cash and connections to a major drug company played a pivotal role in @entity5 's executive order in february 2007 that mandated teenaged girls in @entity6 be inoculated against @entity26 , a virus that can cause cervical cancer			1
( the order was overturned by the legislature two months later and did not go into effect			0
) " the company was @entity33 , and it was a $ 5,000 contribution that i had received from them , " @entity5 responded			1
" i raise about $ 30 million			0
and if you 're saying that i can be bought for $ 5,000 , i 'm offended			2
" but @entity33 's ties to @entity5 run much deeper than one $ 5,000 check			1
@entity33 has given $ 28,500 to @entity5 's gubernatorial campaigns since january 2001 , according to a new report by @entity41 , a political watchdog group , which uses data from the @entity43			1
and since january 2006 , @entity33 has given an additional $ 377,500 to the @entity44 , which , in turn , was one of the largest backers of @entity5 's own campaigns			1
notably , @entity5 also served as the chairman of the governors association in 2008 and again this year , until last month , when @entity52 gov. @entity51 succeeded him , so that @entity5 could pursue his presidential run			0
did @entity15 's drug lobbyist claims ring true ? perhaps more importantly , @entity5 's friend , former chief of staff @entity56 , spun through the revolving door to become a lobbyist for @entity33 in @entity6 , a position he held at the time of the @entity26 - related executive order			1
@entity33 was the first company to offer an @entity64 - approved hpv vaccine , which it offers under the brand name @entity65			2
in 2009 , the @entity64 also approved the drug @entity66 , made by @entity67 , which , for its part , has given about the same amount of money as @entity33 to @entity5 's gubernatorial campaigns since 2001 and nearly four times as much as @entity33 to the @entity44 since 2006			1
in fact , three other pharmaceutical companies have given more money to @entity5 than @entity33 and substantially more money to the @entity44 than @entity33			2
the absence of attention - grabbing headlines does not signify that these companies expect nothing in exchange for their investments			0
to the contrary , it is their fiduciary obligation to return a profit to their shareholders			0
bankrolling politicians -- @entity0 and @entity90 -- is just another tool to help them meet their goals and , in so doing , bolster their profits			0
if anything , money spent on political donations and lobbying holds more sway when it is unexamined			0
@entity5 's ties to @entity33 have made it into the sunlight , and people are now considering his actions in light of their past ties			1
is this an example of " crony capitalism ? " that 's not for the @entity43 to decide			0
it 's the public 's job to decide if the money outweighed the merits in this policy decision , but it needs to have all of the facts in hand to do so			0
furthermore , @entity5 's actions benefiting donors from the pharmaceutical industry do n't appear to stop with @entity33			1
for instance , drug - maker @entity120 has also contributed handsomely to the @entity44 and it has also benefited from @entity5 's support			2
@entity120 has donated $ 700,000 to the @entity44 since january 2006 , although it has only directly donated $ 5,000 to @entity5 's own campaign			1
in 2009 , @entity5 signed a bill into law mandating meningitis vaccines for all college students , a requirement he expanded again earlier this year			0
@entity120 was not the only pharmaceutical company to benefit from the new requirement , but its @entity132 vaccine , introduced less than a year later , fit the bill			0
as for @entity56 , his involvement with @entity5 does n't end with the hpv vaccine			1
earlier this summer , lobbyist @entity56 co-founded a super pac known as @entity137 to aid @entity5 's presidential run			2
according to @entity140 , @entity56 's super pac plans to spend a staggering $ 55 million to help his man win the @entity143 nomination			0
if @entity137 does spend more tens of millions to help @entity5 secure the @entity0 presidential nomination , what might @entity56 and his clients be owed in return ? what might the donors to @entity137 be expecting a president @entity5 to deliver ?			2

@entity151 , @entity152 say @entity5 took heat over hpv vaccine position
they say he claims $ 5,000 @entity33 contribution did n't *influence* his support for vaccine
but , they say , he 's gotten $ 28,500 from @entity33 since 2001 ; his former aide lobbied for @entity33
*writers* : now *ex-aide* runs @entity139 to help fund @entity5 's campaign . what will donors want ?
