we devote one day of every year to celebrating our presidents and the other 364 to complaining about them			1
but what if this year , on presidents day , we realize something else : we have an unhealthy obsession with presidents as the sole movers of @entity10 politics			1
for too long , @entity10 have understood history primarily through the lens of the presidency			1
school textbooks and media accounts all suggest that everything that is good and bad can be understood as the result of a president 's skill , personal foibles and decision - making ability			1
if only president @entity22 , who critics called " @entity22 , " was n't so willing to sell out traditional @entity25 principles ! if only president @entity26 had a better understanding of the complexity of foreign affairs ! if only president @entity30 would be more willing to wheel and deal on @entity32 ! @entity38 is the prime example of a president who has received both kinds of treatment , the person whose legendary political skill is held responsible for the @entity36 and the villain who single - handedly dragged the nation into the quagmire of @entity45			1
it is understandable why we focus so much attention on the president			1
after all , the president is powerful			1
just as important , there is a simplicity to the presidency -- he is a single person , elected every four to eight years , and through his story , we can tell a clear narrative about the complicated processes of politics			0
there is a dramatic arc that can be used to describe the career of a president that serves as a crutch for many journalists and historians , lending itself to more exciting accounts of what happens in @entity68 than someone who digs deeper into the trenches of the messy political process			1
but presidents do n't act in a vacuum			2
on presidents day , we should spend some time thinking the huge range of factors that affect the success or failure of the commander in chief			1
@entity80 is among the most important			0
as anyone who has served in the @entity81 knows , the @entity81 and @entity82 have immense influence over what a president can do and how they go about doing it			2
the moments when there have been the greatest legislative breakthroughs , such as the @entity92 or the @entity36 , have come at times when the presidents were fortunate to find legislative majorities that were willing and able to push through big policy agendas			2
without congressional support , that has been hard to do			0
when the forces of obstruction are strong , even the savviest president -- such as @entity103 after the 1938 elections or @entity38 after the 1966 midterms -- ca n't do much to make @entity68 work			1
the electorate plays a huge role in giving presidents the kind of @entity80 that they need or taking that kind of @entity80 away			2
although @entity10 are often cynical about the differences that elections can make , the truth is that big landslide elections , when voters make a statement at the ballot box , have been able to create sizable majorities favoring a president 's agenda			1
other elections , usually midterms , can strengthen the president 's opponents			2
president @entity30 thrived after the 2008 election , when strong and impassioned @entity25 majorities , feeling the momentum of the historic election , moved as series of landmark bills that included health care , financial regulation and an economic stimulus			2
grassroots activists also have a big influence on the outcome of a presidency			0
the moments when there have been significant shifts in public opinion about certain political issues have often revolved around the hard work of grassroots activists , upon whom a president can rely			2
during the 1930s , the vibrant and growing union movement offered the foundation for @entity103 when he pushed for many of his programs , including the @entity153 of 1935 that created the @entity154 and legitimated unions			0
public opinion in the 1960s shifted to the side of civil rights because of the intense mobilization of movement activists			0
during the 1980s , @entity163 's message resonated with the electorate in large part as a result of how the conservative movement had helped shift public opinion over the decade			0
at other times , grassroots movements can create great problems for a president			2
this was the case when the anti-war movement gradually strengthened public opposition to @entity45 , causing huge problems for @entity179 and @entity180			0
even the national security policies of a given period are not all the result of what a president does or does not do			0
the reality is that presidents operate within a thick institutional environment inhabited by military officials , defense contractors and bureaucrats who play a big role in creating boundaries for the options that a president can employ			1
presidents are also profoundly affected on foreign policy by what they inherit			0
president @entity38 had to deal with @entity45 , an area where presidents @entity199 and @entity200 had already staked out a role for the @entity10			1
most recently , president @entity30 has found it difficult to shift course on of the majority of president @entity26 's counterterrorism programs and on his expansive vision of the president 's wartime authority			0
once policies are in place , presidents often have to respond to them rather than shape new directions			0
political interests and sentiment also grow around existing policies that make it hard for presidents to fundamentally change them			1
finally , there is the political process			0
if we do n't look at the rules of the game , our stories about given political periods are thin			0
for the 1930s to the 1960s , it is impossible to understand @entity10 politics if one does not deal with the immense power of committee chairmen within @entity80 , upon whose authority legislative power depended			1
today , the influence of private money , donors and lobbyists helps explain as much as anything president @entity30 does in the outcome of many policies , such as the decision to pass financial regulation legislation at the height of the economic crisis that was written in a way that provided multiple opportunities for @entity250 firms to circumvent the laws			0
none of this is to say that presidents are not extraordinarily powerful and important			0
but we need to do a better job putting presidents into context , celebrating them and criticizing them with a full understanding of the constraints that they face and the factors upon which they depend			0
if we do n't , we 'll continue to have unrealistic expectations about what the next president will do , and will surely be disillusioned , as we miss what exactly it has taken for the great presidents to succeed .			1
