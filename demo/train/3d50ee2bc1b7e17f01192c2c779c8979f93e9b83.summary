-- @entity2 royals rarely speak to the media ; the @entity4 has done so only once			1
as a result , reporters rely on other people who have spoken to her for information			1
it could be palace sources , or even members of the public who have met @entity14 during a walkabout			2
and while there are all sorts of questions that the public likes to ask of prince @entity21 's pregnant wife , the top of the list at the moment is whether she 's having a boy or a girl			1
it 's not an entirely trivial matter when you consider the current rush to update ancient @entity2 laws in the event the baby turns out to be a girl			1
at the moment , girls are leapfrogged to the throne by younger brothers -- an outdated and sexist protocol that simply is n't acceptable to this generation			0
so if @entity14 has a daughter , that princess would make history by being the first to grow up assured of her destiny			0
this interest in @entity2 's future head of state has turned into a frantic scramble to jump on any nugget of information that may provide clues as to the baby 's gender			1
that latest nugget of intelligence may have slipped from the duchess ' mouth as she chatted to @entity57 , a 67 - year - old royal well - wisher @entity14 met while on a trip to the town of @entity60 on tuesday			1
@entity57 told reporters : " the lady next to me gave her a teddy bear and i distinctly heard her say : ' thank you , i will take that for my d.			0
. ' then she stopped herself			0
i said to her : ' you were going to say daughter were n't you ? ' she said : ' no , we do n't know			0
' i said : ' oh i think you do , ' to which she said : ' we 're not telling			0
' " what started as a minor tuesday visit to northeast @entity73 ended as wednesday 's front page news			0
" does @entity4 's slip of the tongue mean her baby 's a girl ? " asked the headline of the @entity77 newspaper , a question also splayed across the fronts of @entity2 's other broadsheet papers			1
the @entity85 event went a step further , declaring " it 's a girl ! " to readers			2
@entity14 's slip was n't just front page news , however -- it caused a betting frenzy that forced two leading bookmakers , @entity92 and @entity93 , to suspend bets on the sex of the royal baby			1
then , out of nowhere , a report in the @entity99 newspaper quoted someone else who met the duchess			2
@entity102 said : " i swear she said it was a boy ... i asked her if the baby had been kicking			2
i swear she replied ' yes he is , very much so ' but no one else heard ! either i misunderstood it , or @entity4 is trying to confuse us all ! " i was confused , so i followed up with a palace source who told me @entity21 and @entity14 do n't know the sex of the baby , and that she said as much during the walkabout			0

as @entity2 royals rarely speak to the media , reporters rely on other sources , says @entity124
@entity126 of the current list of questions is if duchess is having a boy or a girl
@entity134 of @entity135 's ' slip ' *prompts* *speculation* royal baby is a girl
another report claims duchess hinted she 's having a boy
