-- less than a month ago @entity1 could justifiably feel he was revered in @entity2			1
the singer was in @entity4 to receive @entity2 's highest public award , the @entity6			1
as @entity2 's most prestigious medal was pinned to @entity1 's lapel , his @entity2 hosts heaped praise on the 72 - year - old legend for his contribution to music -- and notably his songs inspired by @entity2 poets @entity16 and @entity17			1
it was impossible to predict that , only three weeks later , @entity1 would be embroiled in an ugly controversy that has resulted in preliminary charges against him in @entity2 for inciting racial hatred			1
ironically , @entity1 's comments were made about @entity23 , not @entity2			1
in a @entity26 interview published in 2012 , the singer was quoted as saying : " if you got a slave master or @entity30 in your blood , blacks can sense that			0
that stuff lingers to this day			0
just like @entity35 can sense @entity37 blood and the @entity38 can sense @entity40 blood			0
" a @entity40 group in @entity2 pressed charges against @entity1 for his remarks			2
now @entity1 , who has performed in both @entity40 and @entity44 , finds himself in legal trouble in @entity2 for comments he made last year about racism in @entity23			1
the @entity40 group claimed that @entity1 was equating all @entity40 with the small minority of @entity40 war criminals			2
the tension between @entity40 and @entity38 has deep historical roots , most recently with the breakup of former @entity54 , during which accusations of genocidal massacres were made on both sides			0
farther back , during @entity58 when the political movement @entity61 ruled @entity40 , it erected concentration camps for @entity35 , @entity38 , @entity64 gypsies and other @entity66 minorities			0
it is believed that roughly 320,000 ethnic @entity38 were killed under the @entity37 - allied @entity61			0
in @entity2 , a country where racism is a sensitive issue , the controversy surrounding @entity1 touches a raw nerve			1
the @entity2 have questioned themselves whether they are racist and xenophobic , especially toward the minority @entity73 and @entity74 populations whose integration into @entity2 society has been rife with tensions and sometimes violence			0
@entity2 minister of justice @entity80 , one of the country 's most prominent black politicians , has been subjected to racial slurs			2
a right - wing @entity2 magazine , " minute , " featured a headline about her : " @entity89 as a monkey , @entity80 gets her banana back			2
" the famous @entity2 movie actress @entity91 has been convicted and fined for inciting racial hatred for her comments about @entity94 in @entity2 after complaining on her website that @entity94 were " destroying our country by imposing their ways			1
" the @entity2 have also struggled with its history of @entity102 , which flared up during the infamous @entity103 at the end of the 19th century when a @entity35 military officer was wrongfully accused and convicted of treason			0
@entity2 's collaboration with the @entity108 during @entity58 is a shameful chapter in the country 's past that was for decades swept under the carpet of collective memory			1
today it is illegal in @entity2 to deny the holocaust and incite racial hatred , and sell @entity37 memorabilia on the @entity118			1
( for example , a @entity2 judge in 2000 found the @entity23 - based company @entity121 guilty of facilitating neo-nazi auctions			2
) @entity1 's published comments have opened old wounds in @entity2			1
yet there is something curious about the timing of these charges against him			0
first of all , the singer made the remarks to @entity26 last year ; they were later published in a @entity2 version of the magazine			0
and the @entity40 group 's complaints against the singer apparently date to november 2012			0
it is interesting , too , that the preliminary charges by @entity2 prosecutors against @entity1 were filed on november 11 , only two days before the legendary singer was to receive his @entity6 from a @entity140 government that is usually admiring of @entity142 © pop singers with a strong anti-establishment political message			2
in the stuffy precincts of the @entity6 's @entity146 , it appears that the government 's nomination of @entity1 for the award had originally been received sniffily			2
in may , @entity2 press reports claimed the 17 - member @entity6 council had tossed out the nomination on the grounds that @entity1 had been an anti-war radical during the @entity155 and , moreover , had used drugs			1
it was only after some backroom intrigue that it was announced that @entity1 would receive the @entity6 after all			0
@entity1 fans doubtless find this whole thing perplexing			0
yet it 's not surprising that this blew up in a country where hate - speech accusations often reach the courts			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			0

@entity1 has been charged with inciting racial hatred in @entity2 for some comments
@entity168 : it 's ironic since he just won @entity2 's highest public award
he says racism is a sensitive issue in @entity2 , and @entity1 controversy touches a nerve
@entity168 : this is *n't* surprising , because in @entity2 hate - speech accusations often reach courts
