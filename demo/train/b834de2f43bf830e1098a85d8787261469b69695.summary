-- @entity2 's longstanding ban on handguns , which the @entity4 this week ruled as unconstitutional , was a complete failure			1
two years ago , every student in my first - period @entity8 class on the @entity10 of @entity2 claimed to have easy access to a handgun -- even the goody - two - shoes honors student in the front row			1
when i doubted her , she looked at me as if i were a fool			2
" i could get you one from my uncle tonight , " she informed me with a quizzical look			2
" he might ask me why i needed it , might not			2
" guns were so abundant that there was only , maybe , one big fight a year among the males in our school building because it was understood that the simplest of physical confrontations too quickly could escalate into deadly shootings			1
" you have to walk away from a lot , " observed one former student of mine who has lost several friends and relatives to gun violence			1
" for instance , dude deserves to be beat and i know i could beat his ass , but then what ? no one is just going to take an ass - beating , they 're going to want to do something about it			2
" and he added , " then you got to worry about him and his guys jumping on you			2
or more than likely , he 's going to get a gun to show that he 's not a punk			0
that 's how a lot of these shootings happen , it 's over nothing			0
" violence was so omnipresent that when i returned to school a few days after being shot in the arm with a .22 ( i 'd rather not discuss ) , a staggering number of students lifted their shirts to show their bullet wounds			1
" what you going to do ? " they seemed to say with a shrug , as if this were everyday life			0
in a city where an average of four people are shot every day , the random shooting death a few years ago of an amazing , beautiful person , @entity67 , a friend of mine , was reduced to a single line in a three - paragraph newspaper story coldly tallying weekend homicides			0
" everything happens for a reason , " the pastor said at his funeral			0
" he 's now in a better place			0
" as gangs and their illegal guns held whole communities hostage , it seemed as if the only people prevented from possessing firearms were citizens like @entity86 , who was raised on the @entity10 and now works as a mentor to at - risk youth for an alternatives schools program in @entity2 " i do n't think anybody in their right mind would argue that more guns are a good thing , " said @entity86 , who has the scar from a bullet wound on his right wrist			1
" but i think the @entity4 made the right decision			0
i think right now , at this point , the ban is not helping to serve any real purpose			1
" @entity86 does not believe that the court 's decision will result in significantly more or less violence , but he does hope that the ruling will force political leaders to seek community improvements beyond just strict gun control			1
" it 's not enough to just say we need more gun control			0
that 's not what 's causing all these problems out here , the guns are the result , " he explained			1
" if we want to stop violence , we need to make real changes			1
that 's a lot harder and requires a lot more money than just saying no guns			2
" in too many low - income communities of @entity2 , the schools are in shambles , quality after - school programs are scarce , well - paying jobs are almost nonexistent , and the family structure is in full crisis			1
it is an easy notion to disregard , but many of these children are struggling daily to thrive in an environment that fosters failure			0
" we have to get them early , before they start getting lost , " @entity86 said of the youth he advises , get them redirected with organizations like his and other successful mentoring interventions like the @entity142			0
" once they start believing there 's nothing else , that they have nothing to lose , they 're the ones most likely to do the shooting			0
" after a recent weekend in which 10 people were killed and 60 wounded by gunfire , @entity2 mayor @entity152 continued to argue the necessity of a citywide gun ban			1
" look at all the guns that shot people this weekend			2
where did they come from ? that is the issue			0
" but one must ask , truly , is it ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			0
