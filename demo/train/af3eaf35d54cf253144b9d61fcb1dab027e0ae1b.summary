-- can companies patent human genes ? it was the question considered by an @entity5 federal court judge who on friday ruled that a @entity7 biotech company was within its rights to hold @entity5 patent 686004			1
that patent covers mutations of the human gene @entity12 which point to a greater hereditary risk of breast and ovarian cancer			1
the same gene , along with another , @entity19 , is at the center of a high - profile lawsuit in the @entity7 set to be heard by the @entity22 in april			1
that lawsuit argues that patents on human genes violate the @entity26 and @entity7 patent law because genes are " products of nature " and therefore ca n't be patented , according to the @entity31 ( @entity31 )			1
the @entity33 defeat was a crushing blow for cancer campaigners who have been fighting to have the patent declared invalid since the case was first filed in june 2010			1
" i wo n't give up the fight because this is too important for future generations of people who at some point in their lives may need testing and treatment for cancers and other diseases , " said breast cancer survivor @entity38 , one of the parties in the case			1
@entity50 of @entity52 lawyers , who represented @entity38 and @entity53 , said : " we are disappointed in this ruling but it is not necessarily the end of the issue in a legal or policy sense			0
" we think there may be grounds to appeal , and that there 's a reasonable chance that we will make that decision in the next week or two			0
" reasons for the @entity5 ruling in his ruling , justice @entity66 found that the process of isolating the @entity12 gene for testing requires human intervention , and because of that human intervention the isolated gene is patentable			1
he said there was " no doubt that naturally occurring dna and rna as they exist inside the cells of the human body can not be the subject of a valid patent			2
" however , he said that the issue in this case was whether an isolated nucleic acid constituted " an artificial state of affairs			0
" he ruled that it did			0
the lawsuit , the first of its kind in @entity5 , was filed against two biotech companies , @entity7 - based @entity91 , which owns the patent , and @entity93 in @entity94 , which has exclusive rights to the testing in @entity5 and @entity97			1
@entity50 said that currently @entity93 was not enforcing its ownership rights under patent laws , though it did attempt to in 2008 but backed down after public backlash			0
" at the moment is it 's not being strictly enforced , but nevertheless researchers and testing institutions feel conscious of the fact that it could be enforced at any time and their work or their testing could be stopped or they could be in trouble for doing it			0
" @entity93 declined @entity0 's request for comment on the ruling , and at the time of writing @entity91 was unavailable for comment			2
supreme court to hear case in @entity7 @entity91 is also defending its right to own a patent on the gene in the @entity7 , where it is named in a lawsuit alongside the @entity125 and the @entity126			1
the lawsuit , filed by the @entity31 and the @entity128 , argues that the patents on genes @entity12 and @entity19 are unconstitutional and invalid			2
according to the @entity31 , the lawsuit was filed on behalf of " researchers , genetic counselors , women patients , cancer survivors , breast cancer and women 's health groups and scientific associations representing 150,000 geneticists , pathologists , and laboratory professionals			0
" it was filed in 2009 and has since bounced from the @entity144 federal court to the appeals court and the @entity22 , which will hear arguments in the coming months on whether human genes can and should be patented			1
the genes at issue according to @entity91 ' website , approximately 7 % of breast cancer cases and up to 15 % of ovarian cancer cases are caused by mutations in the @entity12 and @entity19 genes			1
the company says people found with mutations of either gene have " risks of up to 87 % for breast cancer and up to 44 % for ovarian cancer by age 70			1
" it says its @entity165 test can confirm the presence of mutations so carriers can form " patient - specific medical management plans to significantly reduce the risk of cancer			2
" " this is the beginning of personalized medicine , " said @entity172 , spokesman for @entity53 , a national network representing @entity5 affected by cancer			2
" any testing or access to material for researchers needs to be made as free and as easy as possible for them just to speed it up			0
" @entity172 said the @entity5 ruling was " extremely disappointing " but not surprising			0
" there seems to be a mindset in @entity5 to protect patents at all costs , " she said			0
" to our way of thinking it 's an anomaly of the @entity191 that was never intended to be applied to the human body			0
" she said @entity53 would be pushing for an amendment to @entity5 law to cover human genes			2
" i think the only thing for us to do now is to look at having an exclusion clause in our current patent law or put up a whole new law			0
that 's what we will be advocating for and supporting , " she said .			0

@entity5 federal court rules patent on human gene testing valid
mutations of gene @entity12 increase risk of breast , ovarian cancer
cancer advocacy group had **challenge*d* biotech companies ' right to patent
biotech company @entity91 fighting separate *challenge* in the @entity7
