-- it is the strange " tail " of @entity2 , his cat and a brush with the law that has made the @entity8 cricket team " paws " for thought before trash talking each other on @entity12			1
@entity2 , the world 's top ranked spin bowler , appeared in court earlier this week charged with a drink - driving offence and it is the details that emerged during the hearing that provoked such mirth in @entity8 's dressing room			1
@entity22 magistrates court heard how the 31 - year - old told police officers he had been to buy a screwdriver so he could release his cat who was trapped under the floorboards of his home			2
the trial was adjourned until october , but after the @entity8 team arrived in @entity31 to begin training ahead of the third test with @entity33 , two of @entity2 's teammates joked about the affair on their @entity12 accounts			1
@entity38 , @entity8 's flamboyant batsman , who was born and raised in @entity39 , posted : " 2 hours with @ @entity40 [ @entity2 ] this am and i 'm still not having this ' cat ' story ! ! haha			1
" a short time after , @entity2 updated his account by tweeting : " such a shame my teammates are so remedial in their ' banter '			0
must be because they 're all @entity39 ... " fast bowler @entity48 , who has nearly 55,000 followers on @entity12 , got in on the act too			2
he tweeted : " @entity51 has turned up this morning with a tag round his ankle			0
not sure what that 's for			0
" the players may have enjoyed their online banter but on the pitch @entity8 toiled on the opening day of the third test against @entity33 at the @entity61			1
@entity8 won the toss and chose to bat , hoping to add to their 2 - 0 series lead , but were dismissed for just 233 as @entity65 took five wickets on his test debut			0
opening batsman @entity69 's miserable run of form continued as he was dismissed by @entity71 for just six			0
captain @entity72 was @entity65 's first victim as he was caught behind by @entity73 for just 15 , before the pace bowler went on to claim the scalps of @entity76 , @entity38 , @entity77 and @entity78			0
wicketkeeper @entity79 gave @entity8 's total some respectability with a forceful 84 not out and he was ably assisted by @entity78 , who made 48			0
@entity82 trapped @entity8 's last batsman , @entity83 , @entity84 as @entity33 dismissed the hosts with more than an hour 's play remaining			1
@entity87 and @entity88 started @entity33 's reply strongly , adding 48 , before @entity87 was bowled by @entity48 in the final over of the day .			2
