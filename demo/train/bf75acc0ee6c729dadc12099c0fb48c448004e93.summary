-- running for president is an expensive endeavor , but the cost is n't measured in dollars alone			0
sure , we can count the $ 4 million in super pac dollars @entity4 's allies just spent to tear down his @entity10 opponents with negative ads. indeed , @entity4 and his allies spent nearly $ 150 for every caucus vote he received in his eight - vote victory			2
but you ca n't put a price tag on the principles he sold out to the @entity17 in order to buy its extremists ' support			1
@entity4 , who , @entity21 likes to say , once ran to the left of sen. @entity23 , has scrambled in the past year to get to the right of @entity25 , @entity21 and @entity26			2
the same career politician who less than a decade ago told @entity29 voters " my views are progressive " told @entity31 last month , " i line up pretty darn well with @entity17			2
" in the same breath @entity4 called himself " the ideal candidate " of the right wing			2
as @entity4 now takes his dangerous promises and disregard for the middle class to @entity39 on tuesday , then @entity35 and beyond along the primary campaign trail -- and , he hopes , into the general election -- he 's weighed down by heavy baggage			1
he belittled president @entity44 's $ 1,000 tax cut for typical middle - class families , deriding it as a " little @entity46			2
" but @entity4 's own plan would give that same family just $ 54 , savings even he admits is " not a huge tax cut			1
" he doubled down on his misguided idea to " let @entity52 go bankrupt , " even though the president 's rescue of the auto industry saved more than 1.4 million @entity57 jobs up and down the supply chain , leading to a renaissance in the @entity57 car industry			0
@entity4 has also said he 'd let the foreclosure process " hit the bottom			0
" presumably this is so investors can swing in and make a quick buck			0
drawing on his lucrative business experience of firing workers , off - shoring jobs , closing plants and bankrupting companies , @entity4 has a plan for the speculators , but not the families who stand to lose their homes			1
he promised to veto the @entity75 and deny young illegal immigrants the chance to earn a path to citizenship if they give back to the only country they 've ever known by serving in the military or going to college			0
he backed the right - wing @entity85 budget that would eventually end @entity86 as we know it , gut @entity88 and slash funding for higher education			1
he criticized the president for ending the war in @entity93 , saying he would rather leave 30,000 troops on the ground with no clear mission or plan for withdrawal			0
and the icing on the @entity17 cake ? he has repackaged the same policies that caused the financial crisis -- mistakes like making the middle class pay for tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations and letting @entity107 write its own rules so big bankers can make millions while gambling with everyone else 's economic security			1
these @entity17 - coddling promises may have won @entity4 a caucus , but he 'll find they come at a cost -- to his own candidacy and , even more distressingly , to us			1
to you and me , a @entity4 presidency would mean four years of out - of - control college and healthcare costs			0
it would mean less responsibility for everyone to do their fair share , but more families losing their jobs and their homes			0
but that 's the price @entity4 is willing to pay for the support of the far right			1
once the primary is over , though , @entity4 will have to move back to the middle			1
independent voters are n't going to like the lengths to which @entity4 has married himself to the @entity85 's extremist elements			0
the @entity57 people ca n't afford to give him a pass			0
@entity4 said he wants to be the @entity17 's " ideal candidate , " but by adopting the principles of a group that does n't speak for mainstream @entity85 -- let alone the majority of the @entity57 he hopes to lead -- he could be falling in with the wrong crowd at the expense of the middle class			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity149 .			0

@entity149 : @entity4 sells out *history* of moderate principles to get @entity17 support
she says his long record of positions should give both @entity17 and middle class pause
she says his policy plan *favors* rich , would end @entity86 as we know it
@entity149 : @entity4 will have to tack back to middle after primaries
