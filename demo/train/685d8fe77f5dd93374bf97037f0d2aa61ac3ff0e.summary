@entity0 -- a @entity3 cyclist who was the first to come across the aftermath of a brutal murder in the @entity6 last week told thursday how he helped an injured girl and called for help			1
in an interview with @entity10 , @entity11 , a former @entity12 pilot , recounted the shocking scene he stumbled across as he went on a regular bike ride in a national park			2
@entity11 said what he found in the parking lot -- three people shot dead in a car and a fourth on the ground nearby -- was like " a @entity22 scene			1
" his account came as @entity6 prosecutor @entity24 and investigating judge @entity25 were in @entity3 seeking new leads in the case			1
they met with @entity29 , whose officers have been helping @entity6 investigators to search the home of two of the victims , @entity33 and @entity35 , in the town of @entity37 , in the county of @entity39			1
bomb squad clears suspicious items in victims ' home speaking outside @entity45 police station , @entity24 said it was " highly likely that the reasons and causes for ( the crime ) have their origin in this country			1
" " our presence here does not mean that there are problems between the two jurisdictions , " said @entity24 ,			0
" we wish to reinforce our cooperation and understanding with hope to reach a conclusion to these horrible murders			0
" @entity63 , assistant chief constable for @entity29 , stressed that his officers would do all they could to assist the @entity66 - led investigation			2
@entity24 said wednesday that investigators were focused on three main areas : @entity70 's job , his links to his native @entity72 , and a reported family dispute over money involving his brother			1
born in @entity76 in 1962 , @entity70 was a naturalized @entity3 citizen who had lived in the @entity3 for decades			1
he was an engineer working at @entity78 , a high - tech company owned by @entity79 , an aerospace corporation that builds satellites			2
authorities have been tight - lipped about possible perpetrators and motives in the attack , although speculation has been rife in the @entity3 media			1
@entity11 's account to the @entity10 shed fresh light on the grisly scene that confronted @entity6 police near @entity91 after the alarm was raised last wednesday			1
' @entity93 at @entity94 ' : more questions than answers the first thing he saw as he cycled up the mountain road near the village of @entity94 was the bike of a @entity6 cyclist on the ground , @entity11 said			1
then he spotted the girl , whose parents , @entity33 and @entity35 , and grandmother were subsequently identified as those shot to death in the car			2
she was stumbling and falling over and at first he thought she was playing , @entity11 told the @entity10			0
then he realized she was injured , and put her in the recovery position as she slipped in and out of consciousness			0
the car engine was still revving and wheels spinning , he said , making him fear it could move and harm the girl and the cyclist whose bike he had seen on the ground			2
" at first i thought , there 's been a terrible accident between a cyclist and a car , because there was a cyclist on the ground more or less in front of the car			2
but there were things that did n't quite match , because the cyclist 's bike was n't beside him , so as the minutes went on i started to change my opinion , " he told the @entity10			2
he pushed in one of the car windows , which had bullet holes in it , to turn off the engine -- and saw the bodies inside			0
" i 've never seen people who 've been shot before for real ... but it seemed to me just like a @entity22 scene , and if someone had said ' cut ' and everybody got up and walked away , that would have been it			1
but unfortunately it was real life			0
... it became quite obvious now , taking stock , that it was a gun crime , " he said			2
realizing that whoever was responsible could still be in the area , @entity11 became increasingly anxious but faced a dilemma			0
he had no cell phone signal to call emergency services , but the girl appeared too badly injured for him to carry her down the mountain			0
@entity11 decided to leave her in a safe position and set off back down the road on his bike to summon help			0
he managed to flag down a car and asked the @entity6 motorist to call for help , before returning to the scene to check on the girl , who was now unconscious			1
he added that he was unsurprised that @entity6 police had failed to spot a second child , a 4 - year - old girl , hiding in the back of the car under her dead mother 's legs , for nearly eight hours			1
young girl found alive among bodies in @entity66 @entity11 , from @entity176 in southern @entity177 , went back to @entity66 on wednesday to retrace his route and see if new recollections came to mind			0
the pilot , who now works in civil aviation and has a family business in @entity91 , had given a detailed statement to police immediately after the shooting , including details of vehicles that passed him on the road , he said			0
the 7 - year - old girl he helped is now out of a medically induced coma but remains too badly injured to be questioned , @entity24 said wednesday			0
she is a key witness as the only person alive who potentially saw who carried out the shooting			0
her 4 - year - old sister , who has been reunited with other family members , told investigators she heard noise but saw nothing			0
@entity198 , an uncle of @entity35 , said wednesday that the family , which he described as being of @entity72 - @entity202 origin , was " heartbroken by this shocking crime			1
" " we are very grateful for the support provided by the @entity3 , @entity6 and @entity72 authorities during this difficult time , " he said , in a statement released on his behalf by the @entity3 @entity206			1
" we hope that those responsible for the deaths of our loved ones are brought swiftly to justice			0
" @entity1 's @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 contributed to this report .			0
