-- as an estimated one billion people around the globe take part in events to mark the 42nd @entity7 , @entity2 's images provide a striking reminder of our planet 's awe - inspiring beauty and fragility as an eco-system			1
during a six - month mission to the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) last year , the @entity15 astronaut snapped around 26,000 images , posting daily updates on @entity20			1
" i really tried to capture what i was seeing			2
i was amazed by the response from people			2
it was very fulfilling for me			2
i was doing something which was very interesting for me , but it made me more happy that i could share the images , " @entity2 said			1
@entity2 explained to @entity0 what it 's like to see the world " turning around your feet " and the unique perspective space travel provides on our planet and humans ' collective impact on it			1
describe the view of @entity38 from space ? @entity2 : " it 's a most unreal view you have from up there			1
it 's look as though it 's painted			2
one of the things you gain up there is an appreciation of planet earth as a kind of ship			2
it looks like a ship flying in space			2
" a lot of the time you 're up there you are working so you do n't have a lot of time to look out of the window			0
when you do , most of the time you see oceans and clouds -- which is really nice			0
" but it really takes a little bit of time before you acquire a perception of where you are and what you are looking at and how to look at it in the best way			0
" after a month , a month and a half , something strange happens -- you look out of the window and you know where you are			1
you might be over @entity80 , @entity81 , you just know			0
it 's amazing how you just develop this			1
" how high does the @entity17 orbit ? @entity85 : we are 400 kilometers ( 248 miles ) above the @entity38 and fly at a velocity of 20,000 kilometers - per - hour ( 12,400 mph ) -- the equivalent of about 7.7 kilometers - per - second ( 4.8 miles - per - second )			1
how did traveling to space change your outlook on @entity38 ? @entity85 : " i felt like a human being , a terrestrial guy -- not an @entity15 or a @entity94			1
i felt like an earthling			0
" you get an appreciation of how delicate the planet is			0
you see the atmosphere which covers the @entity38 like a blanket			1
it looked like if i would blow on it too hard it would float away			0
we know if that get 's corrupted in a certain way that 's the end			0
" how do you think humans are affecting the planet ? @entity85 : " the impact we are having on this planet is surely microscopic when we look at one single event , but when you look at it and you repeat these events all over - a few miles across here , a few miles across there , a river here , a river there , a city here , a city there -- and it 's clear we are a major force in shaping the crust of this planet and its clear we have the capability of imparting changes			1
" i can not say we are bad , or that we are causing the planet to go hot or cold			0
we do n't have enough data			0
but it 's clear that we are doing things that have a huge potential of making changes			0
we need to understand more			0
it 's a risky situation with a very delicate eco-system balance which can be dramatically skewed			0
" thoughts on the future of space travel ? @entity85 : " i think space travel will become successful as a tourism activity			0
i wish everybody could go up there and see the world from a different point of view , with different eyes			1
" i would , for sure , send up the politicians ( some of them we should leave there ! ) to change the way they think , but i would also send up philosophers , journalists and theologians			1

@entity2 used @entity20 to send images back to @entity38 during a six - month mission which ended in 2011
the @entity17 orbits 400 kilometers above @entity38 traveling at a speed of 20,000 kilometers - per - hour
