-- @entity1 extended his championship lead to 60 points with a commanding win at sunday 's @entity5 , claiming victory for the third year in a row at the marina bay street circuit and his third successive triumph of this season			1
the @entity12 star , seeking his fourth consecutive @entity14 title , won for the seventh time in 2013			1
however , as he was after winning at @entity17 's home track @entity18 , @entity1 was booed on the podium following the race			1
" fortunately we keep winning so they 've got a reason to boo , but it 's not nice , " the @entity21 said			1
" as long as they keep booing , we are doing a very good job so that 's the way i see it			1
" the parade lap was quite nice there were a lot of people cheering			0
obviously i did n't give them the most exciting race , but on days like this , i really do n't mind			0
" @entity12 team principal @entity37 was less happy with the reaction from some of the crowd			1
" the boy drove an unbelievable race			0
what we have witnessed is one of the best drives i 've seen him produce in terms of raw pace and what he was able to deliver , " @entity37 said			0
" so to see a driver , who has put in a performance like that and to not get the reception he deserves , is not sporting			0
" he says it does n't affect him , that he does n't feel it , and he does have a broad set of shoulders			0
but he is a human being at the end of the day , and like anyone he has feelings			0
" when you 've driven your heart out and you are getting that reaction , to me it 's not fair and not right			2
" @entity1 's closest title rival , @entity17 's @entity65 , battled his way up from seventh on the starting grid to finish second but was 32 seconds adrift in the only night race on the calendar			1
" we knew we did n't have the pace , that we had to invent something , and the first opportunity was at the start , " the two - time world champion said			1
" this is a fantastic podium , a second place that feels like a win			0
@entity12 were too fast all weekend , so we have to congratulate them for a fantastic weekend , and next we have to do better			1
" @entity79 , who will join @entity65 at @entity17 next year , overcame a back problem and a starting position of 13th to take the third and final podium place for @entity83			1
@entity1 's teammate @entity84 had been poised to take fourth place but suffered technical problems in the closing stages and had to retire after slipping down the field			1
" we were just trying to get home at that point but then on the last lap we caught fire , " he said			0
the @entity93 was given a lift back to the pits by @entity65 , for which both were told off by the stewards -- and @entity84 will now face a 10 - place grid penalty at the next race in @entity100 following his third reprimand this season			2
@entity84 was frustrated by his car 's problems , which were explained by @entity37			2
" we could see with 12 laps to go that we began to lose water pressure			0
the water then effectively ran out at which point it is only a matter of time until the engine overheats , which is what happened on the last lap -- it was cruel luck			0
" @entity113 ' @entity112 , who had briefly led after overtaking pole sitter @entity1 at the start , came through to take fourth ahead of teammate @entity117 -- who remained third overall			1
" the start was quite hairy , i kept the inside clear , but @entity112 went in too deep , " @entity1 said			2
" i was able to get the place back , which was crucial because we had good pace , but then we had the safety car			0
" @entity126 's @entity125 , who will replace @entity84 at @entity12 next year , inexplicably ran into a barrier on lap 25 -- meaning the field closed up again behind @entity1 , but the @entity21 roared clear again once the safety car departed			1
the advantage his speed created meant the 26 - year - old was able to go to the pits and still come back out in front			2
" after that again we had the pace , and the car was incredible , which does n't happen by accident			0
it was a pleasure to drive it around this crazy track , " @entity1 said			2
@entity17 's @entity141 was sixth ahead of @entity143 duo @entity142 and @entity144 , with @entity146 's @entity145 and @entity148 's @entity147 claiming the other points on offer .			0
