@entity0 knows his idea could be considered crazy			1
" i thought this project was so large , so ambitious , that no one would take me seriously , " says the @entity3 resident and aircraft enthusiast			1
" in fact , i was concerned they would think i was insane			0
" @entity0 is talking about his @entity9 , which as conceived would be a grand global spectacle			1
if all goes according to plan , a fleet of airships will take off from @entity14 in 2014 and race each other around the world , watched by millions of spectators , before finishing six months later just outside of @entity18			1
the event is planned as a series of 18 back - to - back races that will circumnavigate the globe			2
although the route is n't finalized , the proposed path will take pilots over at least four continents and about 130 @entity27 ( @entity27 ) @entity28 -- among them the @entity30 pyramids , the @entity31 , the @entity32 and the @entity33			0
@entity0 , founder of a group of blimp enthusiasts known as the @entity36 , expects celebrations in each of the cities where the airships touch down , with wide - eyed children gathering to see the blimps float overhead			1
he estimates 140 million people around the world will witness the race -- a number that dwarfs the 5 million or so spectators for the @entity47			1
the first - place prize for the speediest airship ? @entity0 promises at least $ 5 million and the title of @entity51			1
he plans to officially announce the race at @entity33 this fall , giving interested competitors almost two years to prepare			2
a far - fetched dream ? as you can imagine , there are still a lot of " ifs " surrounding the @entity9			1
skeptics might rightly wonder if it will ever happen			0
start dates have been thrown around for years -- september 2011 was one that was widely reported -- and yet @entity0 's race has yet to get off the ground			1
@entity0 says he is still securing sponsors and raising prize money , as well as negotiating with princes and politicians for permission to fly airships over their landmarks			1
the market crash of 2008 caused delays and led potential sponsors to walk away , he says			2
@entity0 estimates there are 30 to 35 airships in the world , and he hopes to rally at least five of them to participate in the race			1
each blimp will represent a nation , region or city , which he believes will encourage fan and sponsor support			2
he expects the race to cost about $ 50 million , to be financed by donations and sponsorships			1
" it 's being funded purely by that good old mechanism we call capitalism , " he said			0
for each of the 18 legs of the race , the blimps will have to follow a set flight path			2
they will fly about 2,000 feet above sea level , making them visible to people on the ground			2
the airships expect to average about 70 miles per hour , which would allow them to travel about 1,000 miles a day , @entity0 says			1
competitors will be timed from the moment they depart to the moment they arrive at an official endpoint			0
the blimp with the shortest cumulative time will be crowned the victor			2
from the @entity116 to @entity117 mention of airships brings to mind the 1937 @entity116 disaster , in which a @entity122 passenger airship went up in flames while attempting to dock in @entity125 , killing 36 people			0
the @entity116 was a rigid blimp , with an aluminum frame containing hydrogen - filled bags that lifted it into the air			0
many airships today are non-rigid vessels that have no frame and are instead filled with helium -- which , unlike hydrogen , is not flammable			0
@entity137 , senior curator of aeronautics at the @entity140 's @entity139 , said airships had their heyday during the first 40 years of the 20th century because they were more capable than airplanes of carrying heavy loads over long distances			0
but as airplanes grew larger and faster , blimps were used less often to ferry cargo			0
the military used blimps for surveillance and reconnaissance until the 1960s , said @entity137 , noting that the @entity154 has been experimenting with a blimp again in recent years			0
in recent decades airships such as the @entity117 or @entity157 blimps have been used for commercial purposes , usually at parades and sporting events			0
@entity137 said using airships as advertising is an age - old tradition he can see investors buying into , especially in a race around the world			1
" those kinds of aeronautical challenges always pique people 's interests , " he said			0
" i mean , i 'd watch that -- would n't you ? " @entity27 's role the idea for the @entity9 first came to @entity175 when he was 23 years old and in @entity177 for the @entity179 bicentennial celebration of 1976			1
as he watched the @entity117 blimp hover over tall - masted sailing ships in the harbor , he envisioned creating an airship race that would unite and inspire people like the bicentennial did			1
but it was n't until 30 years later , after he worked as a accountant , an attorney and an entrepreneur , that @entity0 decided it was finally time to make the @entity9 a reality			1
" i started this out with , ' ok , you 're at a point in your life where either you can retire or you can do something worthwhile			0
' i went , ' are you still crazy ? ' then the next question i asked myself was , ' how 's your health ? ' because to put this together has turned into a large undertaking			0
then the third question : ' if not now ? ' and so with that , it started			0
" @entity0 has found backing for his venture from such heavyweights as the former ceo of @entity208 , a member of @entity210 's royal family and officials at @entity27			1
@entity212 , @entity27 's assistant director general for culture , said the race would allow the @entity215 to highlight its @entity28 , which range from natural wonders such as the @entity217 to man - made landmarks like the @entity219			0
" this offers a great opportunity to publicize the sites , and ... the need to rally international support for their conservation , " @entity212 said			0
" this race would be a world premiere -- something never tried			2
" ' he thinks big ' as @entity0 sees it , his event is n't just about racing blimps			2
he has enlisted the help of @entity235 , former chairman of tech giant @entity236 , to use the @entity9 as a teaching tool for children around the world			1
since his days in @entity240 , @entity235 has helped create @entity241 , a nonprofit that allows educators to share @entity244 curricula on its website			0
@entity235 hopes to use @entity246 to help teachers and students track the race and to give them lesson plans about geology , ecology , history and culture related to the airships ' travel around the world			2
" anything that gets students out of the rut of the physical textbook i think is a good thing , " @entity235 said			0
" i never would have come up with a blimp race as a way to do that , but you can see that it would be very fascinating to young kids			1
" @entity0 also hopes the race will spur the development of new airship technology			1
he sees these vessels , which require less fuel and infrastructure than many other means of transportation , as the future of aviation			0
" it makes so much sense for the environment , and it also makes so much sense for not having to build the roads and not having to dredge the harbors , " he said			0
even as a member of the @entity9 's advisory council , @entity235 confesses he does n't know exactly when , or even if , the race will happen			1
but he hopes @entity0 's dream for this one - of - a - kind event comes to fruition someday			2
" you 've got to give him credit , " @entity235 said			0

@entity3 aircraft enthusiast is planning a blimp race that would circle the globe
the @entity9 would kick off in 2014 from @entity14 and end outside of @entity18
*organizer* @entity0 estimates 140 million people around the world will witness the race
@entity0 says he is still securing sponsors and raising the $ 5 million prize money
