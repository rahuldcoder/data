-- if you 've never been to @entity2 's @entity2 , you 're missing out on one of the true accommodation stars of @entity5 -- a beautiful time capsule of a hotel that glorifies the design and service of @entity10 in the 1960s			1
it 's one of my favorite places to stay in the world			2
next august , however , its main building is slated for tearing down to make way for a new , bigger hotel in advance of the @entity21 in 2020			1
@entity2 's problem is also its main appeal -- it seems stuck in time			1
built in 1962 , before @entity2 's last @entity26 , the hotel is a masterpiece of @entity10 aesthetics and modernist design that 's remained largely untouched over more than five decades			1
it 's hard not to fall in love with the elegance of the main lobby , lit by hanging , hexagonal lanterns and furnished with chairs and tables that resemble plum blossoms			1
the map with a @entity40 clock -- displaying time zones in cities across the world -- still includes @entity44 as an option			0
the @entity47 whiskey lounge serves cocktails that have long fallen out of favor elsewhere in the world			0
devoted staff look after customers with a level of devotion that 's rapidly disappearing elsewhere			2
after helping me buy tickets to a baseball game in @entity58 last year , i was given a packet of directions not just to the city or the stadium , but to my actual seat			0
not the time nor the place for progress i even love all the things about the @entity2 that annoy my friends and colleagues			1
though the rooms have been renovated since the ' 60s , they feel cramped and outdated by modern standards			0
sending the most petite lady on staff to deliver 100 kilos of camera equipment to my room is n't a great display of hotel management			2
and the room service menu is , i think , the most expensive in @entity5			0
( for the money , that better be the best burger in the entire world			0
) somehow the origami turtle on my pillow seems to make up for all manner of faults			0
on the whole , though , the @entity2 makes up for in character whatever it lacks in efficiency or modern amenities			2
in @entity5 , a part of the world defined by an ethos of tear - it - down and build - it - back - bigger ( and faster and more tech savvy ) , the @entity2 pays homage to best of the way things used to be			1
the hotel says the new building will maintain the traditional @entity10 aesthetic and the concept of the lobby , but it seems impossible that a new building will be everything the old one was			2
i know there 's a time and place for progress and renovation			0
i just do n't think it 's this time or this place			0
the folks at @entity116 have started a petition to save the old @entity2			1
if they do n't , i 'll be booking a room next august to say goodbye			0
