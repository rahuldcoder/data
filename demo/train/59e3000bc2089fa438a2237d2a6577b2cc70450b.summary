-- five years ago sunday , the water rushed in , the lights went out and for thousands of @entity4 residents nothing was ever the same			1
the milestone was marked by vigils , tears and reflection on what was , what came after , what still remains to be done and what , if anything , we have learned from @entity15			1
a number of events were planned in @entity18 , @entity19 , and elsewhere to commemorate the anniversary of the landfall of @entity15 , the costliest and one of the five deadliest storms ever to strike the @entity24			1
president @entity25 visited @entity18 on sunday and spoke at @entity26 , where he said that the construction of a fortified levee system to protect the city is under way			1
" we should not be playing @entity33 roulette every hurricane season , " he said			2
@entity25 also vowed that reforms are being put into place " so that never again in @entity24 is somebody left behind in a disaster because they 're living with a disability or because they 're elderly or because they 're infirm			1
that will not happen again			2
" the hard - hit parishes of @entity45 and @entity46 were holding commemorative community events , and a third commemoration was planned in @entity18 ' @entity49			1
@entity15 left more than 1,800 dead in its wake			1
it slammed into the @entity4 near the @entity19 - @entity53 state line early on august 29 , 2005			1
most of the dead were in and around @entity18 , where more than three - quarters of the city flooded after its protective levees failed			1
nearly 300,000 people were displaced			2
after the storm , " we were a city that had no people in it , " @entity62 , who was mayor of @entity18 when @entity15 struck			1
" now , we 're a city that has over 80 percent of its population back			2
lowest unemployment in the country			2
i think we 're on our way to success , " @entity62 told @entity0 's @entity69 as the storm 's anniversary approached			1
still , it is widely agreed that more work remains to bring @entity18 and the @entity4 back from @entity15 's devastating blow			1
some say that little has improved , and entire neighborhoods in @entity19 and beyond have not rebounded			2
" nothing 's really changed , " said @entity79 , 35 , of @entity18			1
some regions are still " in shambles , " he said , and some residents still feel helpless and without support , as if they are " floating in the wind			2
" about 6,000 families own homes that can not be rebuilt			2
one - third of @entity88 say their lives are still disrupted by the storm , according to a @entity91			2
in @entity18 ' @entity94 neighborhood -- seen as ground zero for @entity15 's wrath -- only 4,000 of 18,000 residents have returned			1
" i do n't have to tell you that there are still too many vacant and overgrown lots , " @entity25 said sunday			1
" there are still too many students attending classes in trailers			2
there are still too many people unable to find work			0
and there 's still too many @entity18 folks who have n't been able to come home			1
" " so while an incredible amount of progress has been made , on this fifth anniversary , i wanted to come here and tell the people of this city directly : my administration is going to stand with you -- and fight alongside you -- until the job is done , until @entity18 is all the way back			1
" " this is the place ... where i think the @entity24 people witnessed a real loss of faith in their federal government , " housing secretary @entity120 told @entity0 's " @entity126 " on sunday			0
" i have really been moved by the spirit of the people in @entity18 in the @entity4 , and their rebuilding , and the optimism in progress that i have seen			1
more than 90 percent of the population is back in the @entity18 area , and there is still much ahead of us			1
" when @entity25 took office , 40,000 families remained in @entity139 trailers or were using emergency housing vouchers , " and literally tens of thousands of them were at risk of losing their homes within weeks of us coming in , " @entity120 said			1
" today , 98 percent of the families are in permanent housing			0
" @entity15 made its initial landfall in @entity149 , where 14 people were killed			1
but fueled by the warm waters of the @entity4 , the storm had grown into a monster category 5 hurricane , although experts later said its intensity had decreased and it was a strong @entity156 storm when it the coasts of @entity53 and @entity19			1
the storm cut a wide swath of destruction , wiping out whole sections of @entity53 's @entity4 and swamping @entity161 , @entity162 , with a 20 - foot storm surge			1
despite the attention focused on @entity18 , it was @entity166 , @entity53 that was the hardest hit			1
ninety - five percent of the town 's homes were destroyed , along with 100 percent of its businesses			0
nearly every road was broken up or left under piles of debris			0
@entity166 began rebuilding almost immediately			0
bolstered by $ 100 million in federal aid , it has repaired utilities , roads , schools , community centers and parks , and has recovered 65 percent of its businesses			0
about two - thirds of residents have returned			0
ironically , the @entity18 initially breathed a sigh of relief in those early hours , as it was spared a direct hit from the hurricane and at first seemed to have weathered the wind and rain			1
but @entity15 's worst havoc was yet to come , as reports of levee breaches began to surface and entire neighborhoods flooded			1
@entity15 also dealt a black eye to the government , which scrambled to launch a delayed relief effort after the storm as @entity18 residents suffered and reports of crime and looting were widespread			1
@entity62 in a famous expletive - laced interview lashed out , telling federal authorities to " get off your asses			0
" then - president @entity206 traveled to @entity18 , delivering a speech from @entity49 as he promised , " we will do what it takes			1
we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives			0
" but that " turned out to be a hollow promise , " sen. @entity214 , @entity19 , told @entity217 's " @entity216 " on sunday			0
" ... because the federal government did n't stay and do everything it could			0
the federal government did n't make it easy			0
they made it very , very difficult			0
" mayors of @entity18 and other areas , when they requested money to rebuild , were offered loans of $ 5 million , she said			1
@entity18 ' operating budget , she said , is $ 460 million , and $ 5 million " would n't buy them a loaf of bread for the week			1
" @entity62 told @entity0 recently that he has been reflecting on his own response as the storm approached			2
he acknowledged the mandatory evacuations could have been issued about eight hours sooner than they were			0
asked how @entity139 can combat its still - suffering reputation in the region , agency chief @entity236 told @entity0 saturday he believes responding quickly is the key			0
" speed is going to be critical , " said @entity236 , who distinguished himself as the head of the @entity149 @entity139 before being appointed to the federal post			0
" we can not wait for a full assessment			0
we have to respond as if it 's bad , bring the things together , and focus on the most immediate [ goal ] of keeping it safe , getting to the injured , trapped , and recovering the lost lives , getting supplies in here			0
" " the big lesson from @entity15 is , you ca n't wait to find out how bad it is , " he said			1
" you 've got to respond , as a team , as [ if ] it is bad			0
" @entity25 said sunday a group led by housing secretary @entity120 and homeland security secretary @entity259 is examining disaster recovery nationwide			1
" we 're improving coordination on the ground , modernizing emergency communications and helping families plan for a crisis , " @entity25 said			2
" ... together we are helping to make @entity18 a place that stands for what we can do in @entity24 -- not just for what we ca n't do , " he said			2
" and ultimately , that must be the legacy of @entity15 : not one of neglect , but of action ; not one of indifference , but of empathy ; not of abandonment , but of a community working together to meet shared challenges			2
" the head of @entity139 at the time , @entity279 , resigned two weeks after @entity15 made landfall amid criticism of the federal response -- and 10 days after @entity206 's famous compliment to him , " @entity279 , you 're doing a heck of a job			2
" @entity279 told @entity0 on thursday the talking points he and other federal officials used at the time did not tell the whole story , calling it a " fatal mistake			2
" " they were factually correct , but were n't in context , " @entity279 said			0
" we 're moving all of this stuff in			0
rescue teams are doing this			0
but we never explained to the people that it 's not coming as fast as we want it to , and it 's not enough , because of the number of people that were left behind in the aftermath of the storm			2
" " had i said that at the time , i probably would have gotten the old hook and been pulled off the stage anyway , but the truth would have been out , " he said			0
he criticized former homeland security secretary @entity313 's handling of the situation			0
@entity313 attended an avian flu convention in the midst of the disaster			0
" here is why that 's so important			0
in the middle of any crisis , " @entity279 said , " whether it 's a natural disaster or man - made disaster , you need to have one person in charge			0
and that person needs to be on the ground with the team , understanding what 's going on			0
" on @entity206 's infamous compliment , he said , " i knew the minute he said that , the media and everybody else would see a disconnect between what he was saying and what i was witnessing on the ground			0
that 's the president 's style			0
his attitude and demeanor is always one of being a cheerleader and trying to encourage people to keep moving			0
it was just the wrong time and the wrong place			0
