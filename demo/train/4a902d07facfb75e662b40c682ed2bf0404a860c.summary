-- @entity3 form side @entity1 are on the brink of going out of the @entity5 after @entity7 outfit @entity6 claimed a shock 2 - 1 group a victory at @entity10			1
@entity1 have been in superb form in recent weeks , winning nine of their last 10 league games to move up to third place in the table			0
however , their @entity17 form has not been as strong , and this month 's 1 - 0 reverse at @entity19 was followed by another defeat on wednesday to leave @entity22 's side needing @entity6 to win their last game next month in order to help @entity1 achieve qualification through to the last 32			1
the visitors went ahead in the sixth minute when an unmarked @entity27 guided the ball home from @entity31 ' right - wing cross			0
and @entity6 doubled their lead seven minutes later when @entity33 tapped home from close range after more suspect @entity1 marking			2
the home side pulled one back seven minutes before the break when @entity39 scored from the penalty spot after @entity41 was dismissed for handball on the line			0
however , despite having a numerical advantage for the whole of the second half , @entity1 failed to find the goal they needed			0
the result means @entity6 are top on 11 points and have qualified for the last 32 knockout stage			0
@entity51 side @entity19 are second on 10 points after thrashing @entity53 4 - 1 in the other group game			1
for @entity1 to qualify , they will now need to win heavily at @entity53 in their final match , and hope @entity19 are beaten at @entity6 in the other tie			1
also through to the last 32 are 2010 winners @entity57 , after the @entity59 side won 1 - 0 at @entity60 in @entity61 thanks to a superb long - range strike from @entity64 international @entity63 on the half - hour mark			1
the other match between @entity67 of @entity68 and @entity70 @entity69 ended 0 - 0 , a result that means @entity57 have qualified with 10 points ahead of the final round of matches			1
@entity69 are second on eight points and they will secure their place in the knockout round if they draw at home to @entity60 in their final game , with the @entity80 side needing a victory to progress			2
@entity82 is the only group where both qualifiers have now been decided , after @entity84 won 3 - 0 at @entity85			2
that result means both sides have gone through , on 13 points and nine points respectively			0
@entity91 @entity90 needed to beat @entity93 side @entity92 at home to retain any hope , but they were beaten 3 - 1			2
another side to reach the knockout stage is @entity98 , who saw off @entity100 2 - 0 to make it three wins and two draws from their five @entity104 matches so far			1
the @entity106 outfit are on 11 points , three ahead of @entity108 , who need a point from their final match against @entity112 to also secure qualification			0
@entity115 side @entity114 continued their impressive run of form in the competition , thumping @entity119 4 - 1 to secure their qualification from @entity121 with 13 points from their five matches			2
@entity124 and @entity125 drew 0 - 0 in the other match to leave @entity125 needing to beat @entity127 in their final match to join their opponents in the last 32			1
however , there is all to play for in @entity132 , with any two of three teams still able to qualify			0
last year 's beaten finalists sporting @entity135 beat @entity136 1 - 0 , while a remarkable match in @entity138 saw @entity139 of @entity106 fight back from 3 - 0 down to win 4 - 3 in injury time against @entity141			1
that means @entity139 and @entity135 are level on 10 points and they play each other in the final match			0
a draw there will see them both qualify with @entity136 , who are three points behind in third place , needing to beat @entity141 in their final match and hoping the other game does not end in a draw			0
there was a suprise result in the @entity158 quarterfinals , where @entity159 were beaten 2 - 1 at home by @entity162 side @entity161 in extra time			1
that result means @entity161 now play fellow - second tier side @entity166 in the semifinals , while @entity3 giants @entity168 and @entity169 face each other in the second semifinal .			0

@entity1 on the brink of @entity5 *elimination* after a 2 - 1 defeat by @entity6
they need to win their final @entity179 match and hope @entity6 beat @entity51 @entity19
2010 winners @entity57 *clinch* their place in the last 32 after a 1 - 0 victory at @entity60
