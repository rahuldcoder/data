imagine sitting at a conference roundtable and being able to look out on the turquoise sea for inspiration			2
at lunch , you steal away to sunbathe on deck			0
that night , after a featured speaker presentation , you 'll watch a cabaret			0
tomorrow , you 'll spend a few hours on @entity8			0
this is what a corporate retreat should look like , some meeting planners say , and companies , large and small , are catching on			1
they 're choosing cruises as venues for corporate meetings , events and conferences			1
eight percent of companies surveyed by research firm @entity20 last year listed cruise ships as their first choice for a meeting venue -- up from 6 % in 2009			1
interest is growing partly because , when comparing apples to apples -- including meals , entertainment , presentation equipment and meeting space -- an all - inclusive cruise ship event saves 20 to 30 % on cost , according to cruise event services company @entity33			1
cruising builds in the social and excursion time needed to get a clear head , generate fresh thinking and share new experiences with colleagues			2
" there have been a lot of organizations that deleted or deferred meetings and want to do something to get their momentum back up , " says @entity42 , co-founder and ceo of @entity44 & @entity45			2
" taking people to an environment they do n't go often or have never been shifts the perspective all together			0
they 're not in a ( dark ) hotel ballroom ... thinking , ' here we go again			0
' " business has picked up nicely since the 2008 economic downturn and the " @entity62 effect " socked the meeting industry , @entity45 says			2
her company expects to double its 2010 business next year			2
companies have access to amenities on cruise ships they might not otherwise be able to afford for a retreat -- nightly entertainment , happy hours , floral arrangements , audio / visual equipment , and personally chosen meals rather than preplanned banquet platters			1
" it just disappears from your budget altogether , " @entity45 says			0
corporations working with good cruise lines also need fewer on - site staff to run events , says @entity84 , ceo of @entity85 , an incentive travel and marketing firm			1
" the contracts for cruise programs are often more liberal than hotel contracts on attrition clauses and less restrictive cancellation fees , " she adds			2
" most participants appreciate that they have the opportunity to see many destinations , some of them exclusive to the cruise line , but only need to unpack once			1
" and to top it off , pricing is usually in @entity100 dollars , even when traveling abroad			0
the types of events held on cruise ships run the gamut , but are mostly incentive trips for salespeople in the insurance , financial , direct selling and manufacturing fields			1
cruise ships are also venues for continuing education courses , product launches and national meetings			1
@entity44 & @entity45 's list of cruise customers includes @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			2
companies can book part of a ship or arrange a full , private charter , depending on their size			0
meetings at sea may not be such a good fit for large association meetings , which may require hundreds of breakout rooms			0
cruising has become increasingly accessible for companies in the last decade as " loads of new ships " have entered the market , @entity45 says , with about 27 gateways in the @entity100 , including @entity138 ; @entity139 ; @entity140 , @entity141 ; @entity142 , @entity143 ; and @entity144 , @entity145			1
about 70 % of people live within a five - hour drive of a cruise port , she adds			1
to accommodate increasing demand , @entity44 & @entity45 launched @entity151 , an online portal dedicated to cruise meetings and events , to allow corporate planners to send custom electronic requests for proposals to five cruise lines and negotiate directly for group pricing			1
but the movement is still small			0
about 25 to 35 % of @entity162 's business is group business , and corporate groups are a small piece of that , says @entity167 , the cruise line 's director of charters and incentives			1
( she would n't say exactly what percentage is corporate business			1
) but cruise lines are interested in attracting more corporate business because the lead time is longer , allowing them to commit their space well in advance , @entity45 says			1
" you are starting to see more cruise lines reaching out to corporate @entity100			2
we have a fleet of 22 ships that were purposefully built with conference centers , " @entity167 says			1
corporate trips on @entity162 are mostly three - to five - night programs in the @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 , with some shorter cruises out of @entity190			1
meeting planners express concerns about seasickness and the inability to get on and off at leisure			0
@entity196 says the first is rarely an issue with today 's large , smooth - moving ships			2
@entity167 and @entity45 say the latter is an advantage			0
" it 's a captive audience			0
there 's nowhere for ( attendees ) to go , " @entity167 says			0
as a result , the environment is more comfortable , the speaker wo n't disappear , and attendees wo n't skip sessions to golf instead			0
everyone goes their own way for dinner during many hotel retreats , but not on a cruise ship			0
@entity215 , chief operating officer of modeling agency @entity216 , said her company opted to host two 2,000 - person events on a cruise ship out of its base of @entity221 , @entity190 , instead of holding its usual land - based @entity223 and @entity139 events , because it could offer a similar event for about half the price			1
the response from participants has been great , @entity215 says			0
" @entity229 had it much easier			0
they enjoyed going to shows and dressing up			0
" corporate meeting planners should do their homework before committing to a group cruise program , @entity196 says			1
for example , some cruise ships have lower quality food and smaller rooms than a land hotel			1
organizers should pay attention to how long they will be in port at various destinations and how long they are at sea in between stops			0
" there are many cruise lines out there , some of which can provide a 5 - star experience			2
they need not be the wild spring break on - board experience that some may fear , " she adds			0
" if you are accustomed to land meetings and have never tried a cruise , it might be something worth considering			2
" ( cruising ) is not going to replace hotels , but it 's certainly a nice alternative once in a while , " she says			0
" have you participated in a business cruise ? what did you think of the event ? share your comments below .			1

meetings on cruise ships give participants a fresh *outlook* , event planners say
all - inclusive cruise events can lower costs for host companies
@entity162 has 22 ships with conference centers , but corporate business is still small
