-- a friendly fire incident that killed six soldiers in @entity4 , including five @entity5 , was a result of botched communication and a series of other errors , the @entity1 said			1
the june 9 bombing in @entity12 province is among the deadliest friendly fire incidents in the 13 - year war			0
it also left one @entity4 soldier dead			0
what started as a battle with insurgents on a hillside descended into a tragedy after failures in equipment and communication protocol , according to a @entity1 report released thursday			1
teams involved did not follow established procedures , and one radio had no batteries , while another had a broken talk button , according to the report			1
' a challenging set of circumstances ' in addition , soldiers did n't relay their position correctly , and a supersonic strategic bomber wrongfully relied on a sensor to detect soldiers			2
" though this was a challenging set of circumstances , had the team executed standard tactics , techniques and procedures , and communicated effectively , this tragic incident was avoidable , " air force maj. gen. @entity41 said in the report			1
the 300 - page report by @entity50 was partially redacted before its release under the @entity52			2
" the key members executing the close air - support mission collectively failed to effectively execute the fundamentals , which resulted in poor situational awareness and improper target identification , " @entity41 said			0
at the time , @entity5 and @entity4 forces were using a supersonic strategic bomber to target insurgents and ensure security at polling places five days before the june 14 presidential runoff election			1
bomber mistakes soldiers for enemy to tackle fire better from insurgents , a team on the ground split up at the request of staff sgt. @entity72 , the report said			1
" communication degradation due to terrain " made it difficult for @entity72 to tell the crew of a @entity75 in the area that the team had split up and moved to higher ground			0
@entity72 could not contact the team moving to the hillside because one member had a radio that was out of batteries and the other carried one with a broken " push - to - talk " function			1
@entity72 then sent spc. @entity88 up the hill to act as a verbal communications link			0
meanwhile , at 12,000 feet , a pilot flying the @entity92 scanned the area with night - vision goggles , looking for infrared strobes worn by soldiers to broadcast their presence			2
all the pilot saw were occasional muzzle flashes , which he thought were from the enemy , the report said			1
sensors on the @entity75 do n't detect infrared strobes , and the night - vision goggles the pilot used are not designed to see infrared strobes at an altitude higher than 7,000 feet			0
the bomber did not have permission to fly under 12,000 feet because of the presence of @entity5 drone aircraft at lower altitudes			2
about 7:30 p.m. on june 9 , the @entity112 dropped the two bombs that killed the soldiers			0
staff sgt. @entity115 , 24 , of @entity116 , @entity117 , was wearing the strobe on the back of his helmet when he was killed			0
@entity72 , 28 , of @entity121 , @entity122 , who split the hillside team , was also killed			0
the other @entity5 deaths included @entity88 , 25 , of @entity126 , @entity127 ; cpl. @entity128 , 22 , of @entity129 , @entity130 ; and pvt. 2nd @entity131 , 19 , of @entity132 , @entity133 .			2

teams involved did not follow established procedures , @entity1 report says
one radio had no batteries , while another had a broken talk button
six soldiers , including five @entity5 , were mistaken for the enemy and bombed
