@entity0 , @entity1 -- in april this year i read an email newsletter from a youth leadership forum in my hometown of @entity0 , @entity1 , that i regularly receive			2
this one had a small article about a video speech contest called date with history , organized by a non-profit alliance called @entity12 , asking for two - minute speeches answering the question " if you had two minutes to tell leaders what kind of future you want , what would you say ? " i immediately started writing ideas on my hand during school			1
i really wanted to add my voice to the movement of young people everywhere , who want to work together as global citizens , to make the world a better place			1
since hearing that i 'd won the contest and will really speak truth to power , i 've been thinking long and hard about the future i want			1
what shall i tell world leaders gathering at the @entity35 ? how can i speak for those who ca n't ? how can young people inspire action , not only hopeful words , from leaders attending the summit ? see also : can @entity35 solve the world 's environmental problems ? i envision a future where every person 's rights are respected and protected			1
i envision a future of harmony and balance , of knowledge and freedom , of peace and prosperity , where wealth is defined as an abundance or profusion of happiness			1
i really believe we can make this change , idealistic as it sounds			2
first , we need to educate everyone -- and in a transformative way			0
every child born should have at least a primary education			0
but the system we know will only breed more of the same kind of thinking that got us into the pickle we 're in now			0
as i said in my date with history entry , we ca n't meet the future with what we did in the past and i believe that education is the key to change			1
we need to think differently about human capacity			0
we need to encourage creativity and divergent thinking			1
i see the education system working to a linear ' production line ' mentality where children are batched - year 1 , year 2 , year 3 -- and then processed through @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and so on , until they emerge beautifully standardized			0
education seeks to systematically individualize us through measurements like grades and tables			0
we know that good things happen in groups , that collaboration is the key to change			1
education is a transformative process			0
so what can we do now ? involving youth is key to making this change			0
just imagine what we can achieve if we put youth thinking together with the experience of the older generations before us			0
initiatives like the @entity108 + @entity111 dialogues help increase knowledge for young and older generations , giving youth the impetus to commit to sustainable development in ways our current leadership has n't even thought of yet			2
secondly i 've noticed ( have n't we all ) that we use too many resources to serve our endless consumption needs , we continue to use dirty technologies instead of investing in cleaner ones and we do n't respect the planet 's limits			2
how we can mimic nature and learn from @entity125 ? we can no longer continue to " take - make - waste " as @entity126 said in 1992 , we need to embrace systems that work as a cycle			1
the concept of biomimicry has had more lab work than any modern technology -- 4.5 billion years of experimentation , to be exact ! in nature all processes are cycles , where the waste from one " phase " is food for another			1
@entity142 implementation of closed - loop technologies might be one of the fastest ways we can help to slow the path to irreversible temperature rise and to conserve our precious resources			0
a fellow @entity149 , @entity151 from the @entity152 , put it beautifully in her entry speech : " we hear the phrase ' @entity155 ' a lot			0
the truth is , planet earth will survive			0
it 's the human race that wo n't survive			2
humans can not adapt quickly enough to a changing climate			0
" i say , let 's learn from the environment around us , let 's be inspired by the wonder and beauty of the world , let 's utilize the perfection of knowledge that nature surrounds us with			1
as a hero of mine , @entity176 , once said " the more our world functions like the natural world , the more likely we are to endure on this home that is ours , but not ours alone			2
" leaders must act now			2
i ca n't put it any more simply			0
if our leaders want our support , they must deserve the trust that three billion youth -- half the world 's people -- have placed in them			1
it 's time for our leaders to look youth in the eyes and remember just who needs the just , safe , secure and equitable future they talk about			1
before my speech at the @entity195 , i 'd love to hear from people everywhere about the future they want			2
you can tell me here			0
what do you think @entity201 should i say to say to world leaders ? leave a comment below ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity206 , 17 , will address world leaders at the @entity35 + 20 summit next week
" i envision a future where every person 's rights are respected and protected , " she says
she believes that schools should encourage creativity and collaboration
we should take inspiration from nature and learn to *re-use* waste , says @entity206
