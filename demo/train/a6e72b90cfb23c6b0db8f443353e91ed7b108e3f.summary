-- after more than six years , @entity1 is set to unveil the latest iteration of its @entity4 line this wednesday			1
with the @entity5 , @entity1 also aims to recapture some of the luster it has lost to competitors like the @entity9 and @entity10			0
while @entity1 's @entity12 is still the gaming world 's best - selling console with more than 150 million units , estimates put @entity16 sales at about half that at 77 million			1
according to a report in @entity19 , the new @entity5 will let users stream games online			1
@entity1 is also rumored to be working on an online tv service to rival cable companies which would prominently use the @entity4 console			2
@entity1 's decline has been seen as a metaphor for the falling fortunes of @entity29 @entity1 's share price rose 1.5 % higher by mid-day on the @entity31 as investors hope the @entity5 will be a financial lifeline for the troubled tech giant			2
in its most recent quarter , @entity1 bled $ 123 million from its books with gaming - related sales falling 15.1 % year - on - year while its ailing television division saw sales plunge 23.3 %			2
the company 's third quarter results appear to stem a larger loss of $ 197 million from its second quarter and a $ 310 million loss in its first			0
but if @entity1 does not report a profit for the fourth quarter of 2012 , the company will post five full years of consecutive losses			1
one crutch for @entity1 -- and all other of @entity51 's exporters from automobiles to tech and optics -- has arrived in the form of currency devaluation			0
since october 1 the yen has weakened 20 % -- from under 78 yen to more than 93 yen to the @entity59 dollar -- which has helped the bottom line of @entity63 's exporters			1
as a currency weakens , a country 's exporters enjoy a profit boost when earnings are repatriated back to the home country			0
@entity63 's prime minister @entity70 has continued to voice strong support for monetary easing and the associated yen weakness			0
at the same time , the governor of the @entity75 , @entity76 , announced he will step down march 19 -- several weeks earlier than his scheduled term ends			0
@entity76 had opposed some of mr. @entity70 's stimulus measures			0
the international community fears the fall in the yen may spark a currency war			0
in the meantime , a weaker yen gives @entity1 and the rest of @entity63 's exporters an easier path to recovery			1
a strong debut for the latest version of the @entity16 , one of @entity1 's marquee products , would also be a welcome relief for the beleaguered company .			1
