-- @entity1 is in the grip of the " sixth great extinction crisis , " say some scientists , with up to 2,000 species dying out each year			1
these 11 great wildlife experiences could disappear within your lifetime			1
witnessing a great animal migration ancient rock art images of animals moving across the @entity13 savannah indicate that humans have been marveling at animal migrations for more than 20,000 years			1
but poaching , agriculture , war and deforestation are encroaching on wildlife corridors around the world , placing these animal movements -- from @entity24 's wildebeest migration to the annual pilgrimage of @entity26 -- under threat			1
how to do it : @entity31 pairs good wildlife access with creature comforts on its @entity33 ( eight days from $ 3,490 per person ; +1 888 800 4100 ) , taking in @entity37 's @entity36 , @entity38 and the @entity39 , where @entity24 's wildebeest end their migration			1
coming eye - to - eye with a polar bear while hunting is still allowed by some @entity48 - dwelling native communities , it 's climate change that poses the largest threat to polar bears			1
latest data from the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) shows that eight of the 19 sub-populations of polar bear that roam the @entity48 are in decline			1
scientists project that two - thirds of all polar bears could disappear by 2050			2
due to its southern exposure , @entity61 's @entity60 is one of the bear habitats most threatened by climate change -- increasing temperatures are forcing bears off the ice earlier each year			1
how to do it : @entity70 ( +1 866 846 9453 ) is one of a handful of operators on the western shores of @entity60 that facilitate multi-day bear watching tours starting at around $ 3,000 per person			2
counting the stripes on a tiger tigers once roamed freely across @entity81			2
today the world 's most endangered big cats have disappeared from 90 % of their historic range			2
just six of nine known tiger species are thought to remain , with an estimated 3,200 animals left in the wild			1
while it 's extremely rare to spot the elusive beasts in their natural habitat ( the @entity90 tiger , for example , has n't been seen since the early 1970s ) , protected reserves in @entity94 and @entity95 provide the best opportunities			1
how to do it : @entity98 offers a @entity99 ( four days from $ 430 per person ; +1 800 970 7299 ) tour to @entity95 's @entity102 from @entity103			2
once a royal hunting reserve , @entity104 is home to elephant , rhino , crocodile , monkeys , deer and about 100 bengal tigers			2
swimming amid live coral on @entity115 's @entity114 the @entity114 , the world 's largest reef system , is in peril			2
temperature fluctuations are primarily to blame for the disappearance of half its coral since 1985 and the @entity123 predicts that less than a quarter could be left within a decade			2
following plans by the @entity115 government to industrialize parts of the reef , the @entity125 passed a recommendation to consider listing the @entity132 site as " in danger " at a meeting in june 2014			2
how to do it : @entity136 ( +61 7 4099 6999 ) offers daily snorkeling and diving day trips to the reef from the @entity141 resort town of @entity142 starting from $ 174 per person			2
tracking gorillas in the mist endemic to the forests of @entity24 , both species of the world 's largest primate have been decreasing in numbers for decades largely due to poaching and disease			1
worryingly , a 2010 @entity154 report suggested that these gentle giants of the forest might disappear from large parts of the @entity158 , one of their primary habitats , by the mid- 2020s			1
how to do it : wilderness collection offers gorilla tracking opportunities during a six - day tour , from $ 6,474 per person , split between two luxury @entity168 camps ( +27 11 807 1800 ) in an area of the @entity170 that 's home to a high density of western lowland gorilla			2
chimpanzee , leopard , golden cat and a large number of other primate and bird species are also present			0
seeing the creatures of @entity180 as @entity181 saw them remaining virtually undiscovered for centuries did much to preserve the living showcase of evolution described by @entity181 in " @entity185			0
" but @entity187 's best known ecosystem remains fragile			0
the last remaining @entity189 tortoise , fondly known as @entity190 , died in 2012 , adding to the list of several other species that have died out since @entity181 's 1835 visit			0
how to do it : while it 's possible to fly to @entity180 from mainland @entity187 and visit several islands independently , you can only reach the bulk of protected habitats on heavily regulated organized cruises			0
you can expect to pay from around $ 1,500 for a last - minute , week - long cruise organized in the capital @entity204 or @entity205 on the island of @entity207			0
prices double ( or more ) for the convenience of booking ahead through an international company such as @entity211 ( +1 800 633 7972 )			0
hanging around with orangutans sharing 98 % of our dna , orangutans are one of the closest relatives to man , though if predictions are accurate , @entity81 's only two great ape species could be extinct in the wild within the next decade			1
conservation groups such as @entity223 have bolstered numbers through rehabilitation and release programs , but the illegal pet trade , trafficking and habitat destruction still present the greatest threats to the survival of orangutans on the only two islands they inhabit : @entity234 and @entity235			0
how to do it : @entity238 's adventures include a visit to two rehabilitation centers in @entity234 on their @entity242 tour ( 18 days from $ 2,500 ; +44 0808 274 5981 )			0
the trip includes a cruise down @entity245 , where you might spot orangutans , proboscis monkeys , macaques and elephants in the wild			0
watching sea turtles nest scientists have been debating for decades why -- not to mention how -- sea turtles return to the same beach every year to lay their eggs			1
but the phenomenon may soon be a thing of legend thanks to the ravages of intense egg collection , fisheries bycatch and light pollution , which have forced species such as the leatherback , hawksbill and green turtles onto endangered lists			0
how to do it : you can sign up for a volunteering stint with an organization such as @entity275 ( nine - day @entity277 program from $ 2,800 per person ; +1 978 461 0081 ) during which you 'll help safeguard turtle eggs and assist new hatchlings			0
spotting @entity24 's @entity282 @entity284 game hunters and the illegal wildlife trade may soon reduce @entity24 's most prestigious group of game animals from the legendary @entity282 to four			1
while lion , @entity13 elephant , cape buffalo and leopard populations are relatively stable , rhinos are in serious trouble			1
poaching has increased dramatically during the past few years , with 800 rhinos killed illegally in @entity296 in 2013 alone			0
last year , the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) declared the western black rhino officially extinct			0
how to do it : all members of the @entity282 can still be found in @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity296 , @entity37 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 and the @entity307			0
if you 're particularly eager to see rhinos , @entity98 's @entity309 ( nine days from $ 1,155 per person ; +1 800 970 7299 ) includes a dusk game drive in @entity300 's @entity314 for a chance to spot both white and black rhino			0
swimming alongside whale sharks nicknamed " dominos " for their distinctive markings , the world 's largest fish are among the most placid of the shark species			1
unfortunately , demand for whale shark meat , fins and oil , on top of unregulated tourism , remains an enormous threat to this vulnerable species			1
how to do it : a @entity333 - sponsored ecotourism project in the @entity335 village of @entity336 allows tourists to swim with whale sharks while following strict rules to avoid disturbing them			1
@entity340 ( +63 2 576 5934 ) offers snorkeling packages with gear and a trained guide from around $ 25 per person			0
be awed by a giant panda in the wild they 're @entity90 's natural treasure , but threats from humans have left just 1,600 giant pandas in the wild			0
high in the mountains of western @entity90 , the rarest member of the bear family plays a critical role in facilitating the growth and vegetation of the bamboo forests these placid beasts inhabit			0
how to do it : given the difficulty of spotting giant pandas in the wild , only a small number of tour operators exist			0
the @entity333 - partnered @entity367 of @entity90 tour ( 13 days from $ 9,595 per person ; +1 303 449 3711 ) includes a visit to @entity90 's @entity371 and rare access to a panda sanctuary to search for them in the wild			1
@entity376 is a travel writer who has contributed to @entity378 publications , @entity379 and @entity380 .			0

you can swim alongside rare whale sharks in the @entity335
@entity13 wildebeest among great migrating animals under threat
