-- @entity1 might not have faded to black			1
despite collapsing at the end of the " @entity6 " finale , everyone 's favorite meth kingpin could still be alive -- or so star @entity7 teasingly implied to @entity0 's @entity8 on thursday			1
" hey , you never saw [ body ] bags zip up or anything , " he quipped			2
but it gets us thinking : if comic books ( and comic - book movies ) teach us anything , it 's that when some characters appear to die -- we 're looking at you , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity25 agent @entity24 -- appearances can be deceiving			1
we never saw body bags at the end of " @entity28 , " either ; did @entity29 get a non-fatal heart attack from too much cannoli ? or stress ? @entity29 had stress			1
what about the others ? @entity35 on the finale of " @entity37 " ... @entity38 on the finale of " @entity40 " ... xena on the finale of " @entity41 : warrior princess " ... we never saw literal or metaphoric body bags there , either			1
what if -- grievously but not mortally wounded , captured but not killed , sent to the land of the spirits with a round - trip ticket -- they survived ? could there be spinoffs ? movie sequels ? hey -- death be not proud , and neither am i. let 's examine some possibilities ...			1
" lost " how you think it ended : on a mysterious , supernatural island , a wounded @entity35 ( @entity60 ) lies down on a forest floor and closes his eyes			2
what really happened next : the island had been purgatory all along , and his soul now ascends to @entity69			0
but all is not right in @entity72 's kingdom			1
a mysterious plague has been killing the archangels , while leaving the seraphim and others untouched -- and only dr. @entity35 has the knowledge and skills to isolate the virus , find the culprit and answer the burning question : where do angels go when they die ? " @entity28 " how you think it ended : the mob war over , the @entity87 family is together at @entity90 's diner when suddenly everything goes black			1
what really happened next : after awakening from his angina - attack blackout , @entity29 ( @entity93 ) vows to leave the business and get healthy			0
he slims down , grows a scruffy beard and opens a quiet little bar in @entity99 , @entity100 , while wife @entity101 ( @entity102 ) becomes an @entity104 nurse and develops a drug problem			0
" @entity40 " how you think it ended : @entity38 ( @entity108 ) tells her secret - agent son @entity109 that she needs to blow up her house to take out some gunmen and give her grandson @entity112 and his protector @entity114 a chance to escape			0
unfortunately , she has no remote detonator			0
what really happened next : @entity38 realizes she 'd actually been listening to @entity109 's voiceover narration about spy - craft and absorbing it			2
using two cell phones , she whips up a remote detonator , blows up the house from a safe distance and escapes with @entity112 and @entity114 -- who discovers he has a thing for older women			0
they form a very modern family and buy a house near @entity109 , who finally marries @entity131 , and surrogate grandpa @entity132 ( @entity132 )			0
" @entity41 : warrior princess " how you think it ended : @entity41 ( @entity137 ) sacrifices herself in battle in order to free the souls of 40,000 people			1
@entity143 's spirit appears and reassures sidekick @entity144 ( @entity145 ) she 's at peace			2
what really happened next : " @entity143 's spirit appears " ... and she 'll appear again ! the partnership continues ! new series : " @entity41 : ghost warrior " ! " @entity6 " how you think it ended : wounded , cancer - riddled , former drug kingpin @entity1 collapses in a meth lab as police storm in			1
what really happened next : he was just passed out , and after struggling with cancer in prison volunteers for experimental drug therapy in exchange for clemency			0
the treatment works , but he ca n't return to his family and he 's broke			2
solution ? write a best - selling memoir ! called " @entity166 , " it makes a fortune and gets optioned for a tv series			0
given casting approval , he confounds the industry by choosing the goofy dad from " @entity173 " to play him			0
we bet you could , too			0
few series wrap things up perfectly ( " @entity178 " the rare and brilliant exception )			0
are there other series finales where we could resurrect the dead ? let us know in the comments field .			1

@entity7 dropped teaser to @entity0 's @entity8 : @entity1 really dead ?
@entity187 : there were other finales where doomed characters were not what they seemed
he *speculates* on what real *outcome* was for " @entity28 , " " @entity6 , " " @entity41 " ...
