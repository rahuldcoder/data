-- painted sky - blue , these small flying machines may look like toy planes but they have @entity4 scrambling to secure its airspace			1
in recent weeks , @entity4 's defense ministry has discovered three crashed unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity8 ) that it believes belong to @entity9			1
equipped with @entity12 - made digital cameras , the drones captured images of important military installations and @entity4 's presidential office in @entity16 , according to local media reports			1
@entity4 says the aircraft are a sign of @entity9 's heightened surveillance that should be taken seriously , and yet officials and experts suggest the drones pose little , if any , real threat			1
" the small drones , presumed to have come from @entity29 , do n't really have great military significance , " a spokesperson for @entity4 's defense ministry , @entity25 told reporters on tuesday			1
" even if they are to be used for future attacks , ( they ) can only carry 2 - 3 kilograms of @entity34 and can not cause a huge ( amount of ) damage , " he said			2
unmanned drone crashes on @entity4 border island the machines are made of polycarbonate , which is difficult to detect with radar , according to @entity4 's @entity43 news agency			1
the vehicle , which flies at an average speed of about 110 km per hour at an altitude of 1.3 km , is controlled by a basic transmission system but is n't sophisticated enough to send images instantaneously			0
" even if it is used for reconnaissance with a camera attached , the quality will be no better than information collected by commercial satellites , " said @entity25			0
" also , there is a limit to how much it can be utilized in operations because they do n't have ( a ) real - time transmission function			2
" of the three drones , two have turned up images of targets of military significance -- strategically important islands near the @entity64 , and the @entity65 , residence and office of @entity4 's president @entity68			1
the data from the third drone , which had been found by a wild ginseng digger , could not be analyzed as its discoverer had wiped the camera 's memory card for his own use , the @entity69 reported			0
according to @entity79 , the @entity80 editor of @entity82 magazine , this type of @entity8 can only travel limited distances			0
" it has quite a small range , it does n't have very long endurance so it would only be up there for a few hours			0
you would use those to see what the other guys are doing in a battlefield environment			0
so it 's very useful in terms of knowing what 's going on behind the next hill , or the next mountain or even over the other side of a wall			0
" most armies have unmanned vehicles like these to varying degrees , says @entity79 , but they 're not designed to be armed			2
" they 're very much closely built off a remote - controlled aircraft that you can buy in a toy store			2
they 're just a militarized version of that , " @entity79 said			0
11 @entity29 missing after cargo ship sinks flying bombs ? @entity29 has flaunted similar , larger uavs at military parades in recent years			1
these target drones are designed to test how well pilots can shoot at a moving object , or the accuracy of missiles			0
but it seems the @entity29 have reverse - engineered them with explosives , says @entity79			1
" the way in which those have been used or have been modified by some countries is that they put an explosive in the front , so they do turn it into a flying bomb or a flying missile			0
so it 's got a one - way mission -- you can fly it somewhere and then you can crash it			0
" @entity135 footage shows @entity29 exercises uses them for this purpose , but it 's an expensive way to build a bomb , says @entity79			2
" you get one use out of it			0
" the explosion , depending on the charge and the level of sophistication of the charge , would be only big enough to take out a single vehicle or a ship			0
" uavs are a major part of the modern battlefield			0
we just have to look at how the @entity152 uses them in @entity154 and @entity155 and @entity156 , but the @entity8 that the @entity152 is using are significantly more sophisticated			0
there 's no comparison really			0
" some analysts have also suggested @entity29 could use @entity8 to carry out a chemical or biological attack on the @entity4			1
but @entity79 doubts it would come to that			0
" if @entity29 did a chemical or biological attack on @entity4 in any kind of situation , the @entity152 and @entity4 would respond with a massive amount of force ... you would have the world 's largest military on your doorstep very quickly			1
" @entity4 investigates two suspected @entity29 drones @entity4 bolsters air defense network the discovery of the drones comes amid mounting tensions across the 38th parallel			1
annual @entity152 - @entity4 joint military drills that ended on april 7 , drew criticism from @entity29 , which views the exercises as " dress rehearsals for invasion , " according to @entity184 , coordinator of the @entity185 at the @entity186			1
two weeks ago , @entity9 fired two mid-range ballistics missiles off its eastern coast , in apparent response to the drills			0
days later , the two sides exchanged hundreds of shells across the @entity193 , their disputed maritime border , after @entity29 warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device			2
" this time of year is provocation season , " says @entity79			0
" it 's all good stuff because it allows the @entity29 to do something provocative and slightly annoying which might embarrass @entity4 , but it 's not provocative enough to create a proper military response			1
" but @entity4 is taking precautions to secure its airspace			2
in a weekly meeting with senior aides monday , @entity4 's president @entity68 warned that insecurities among many citizens , especially those living near the border , are growing in light of the recent provocations from @entity29			1
" drones suspected of belonging to @entity29 appeared to have spied in all directions , but our military authorities were completely in the dark about this , " she said			1
" i think there are problems with the air defense and ground reconnaissance systems			1
" we should view it seriously that @entity29 has fired missiles and strengthened reconnaissance			2
to prepare for the possibility of additional provocations , we need to come up with measures to immediately block and repel any provocations			0
" on monday , @entity4 's military launched an expansive search for further drones			2
two days later , a spokesperson for the defense ministry told @entity0 that @entity4 plans to purchase low - altitude radar to improve the country 's ability to detect small @entity8			1
he declined to say how many or where the radar would come from			0
@entity4 's own reconnaissance drone program includes a deal to buy four @entity8 from @entity241 for over $ 800 million			2
person , from the @entity186 says that if the drones are from @entity29 , it is a violation of the armistice agreement and @entity4 should be concerned that its airspace was violated			1
" but given just how low - tech these things are , i do n't think @entity4 officials are so very concerned right now , " he said			1
@entity249 reported from @entity16 ; @entity250 reported and wrote from @entity251 .			2

@entity4 suspects that three drones discovered in recent weeks belong to @entity29
the unmanned aircraft are fitted with digital cameras , difficult to detect with radar
experts say the drones are low - tech and pose little threat
@entity16 is bolstering its air defense network in light of the discovery
