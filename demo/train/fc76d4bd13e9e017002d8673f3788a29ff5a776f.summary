@entity0 is 6 - foot - 6			2
@entity1 is 4 - foot - 2			2
it 's probably too much to expect the mayor of @entity4 to get down on his knee and look @entity1 in the eye before he destroys the 9 - year - old 's future			1
but @entity0 could at least learn his name			2
or any of the 600 children whose future @entity0 just sacrificed			1
last week , the @entity4 mayor reversed plans to allow three charter schools -- all run by the high - performing @entity19 chain -- to open in city buildings			1
@entity21 killed off two of the schools before they could open next year			1
but the closure of the third , @entity25 , has evicted hundreds of fifth - , sixth - and seventh - graders and abandoned them to a predictable path			2
admittedly , i am a fan of school choice in general and @entity19 in particular			1
i have a kindergartner who attends @entity19			1
and on saturday , i went to the condemned @entity25 to meet the evicted parents and children			1
so i have seen something @entity0 refuses to see			2
i have been in a @entity19 school			1
there , face to face , you ca n't avoid the two clear paths -- one of these families ' choosing and one de @entity0 has chosen -- and seeing where they will lead these children 's lives			1
@entity10 looks people in the eye			2
i noticed it first when she firmly shook my hand			2
she held my gaze while telling me about the @entity51			2
but that 's not the most impressive thing about this 10 - year - old			2
in 2013 , @entity10 was one of the 96 % of @entity19 fifth - graders to pass the state math test			1
in the state of @entity4 , no class did better			1
not the rich kids on the @entity60 ; not the rich white kids in @entity61			1
" we 're not talking about associates degrees here , " said @entity64 's mother , @entity63 , about the path where @entity19 placed her daughter			1
" my kid is talking about being a judge			2
" @entity63 grew up in @entity71			2
she went to the district zone schools she was assigned to attend			1
" it 's not fair , " @entity63 said , comparing the process to the " @entity74			2
" " if you 're in @entity77 , you go to a bad school ; if you 're in @entity77 , you go to a good school			1
" when she married , both @entity63 and her husband committed to providing their children the best education they could find			1
education " is the one thing no one can take away from you , " she said			2
we sat silently for a moment			0
there was no need to point out that her statement was obviously untrue			0
" he 's taken my child 's future away			0
" @entity96 knows the path her son @entity1 and his brother @entity99 will be forced to follow because of @entity0 's decision			0
it 's the path her three oldest daughters went down			0
they all went to the assigned district school in @entity71			1
" @entity96 dropped her head to the table before relating of school fights involving her daughters a week ago , two months ago , years ago			1
" i 'm not sending my sons to the school by my house			1
" my youngest daughter has been held back three times			0
she 's now too old for her class , so they 're about to transfer her to an alternative school			1
she wants to drop out			0
my middle daughter did drop out			0
but my oldest , she eventually graduated , " @entity96 said			0
@entity1 sometimes helps his teenage sisters with math. " math is my favorite , " said @entity1 , who , like @entity10 , looks me directly in the eye			0
" they teach us different ways to do math ... besides the standard algorithm			0
" again , @entity1 is 9			0
@entity1 and @entity10 were on a path at @entity25 where 85 % of all the students passed the state math test			0
a few blocks away is the path @entity96 described and @entity0 would force them to follow			0
at @entity137 , 8 % of the students passed the state math test			0
at @entity139 , 3 % passed			0
why would anyone shut down these schools ? there are two theories as to why @entity0 would evict hundreds of minority children in @entity71			1
the first theory is political retribution			0
@entity21 hates the founder of @entity19 , @entity148 , who is also a @entity150 , and he 's made no secret of it			1
in fact , he called his shot			0
" another thing that has to change starting in january is that @entity148 can not continue to have the run of the place , " he said at a candidates ' forum last year			0
" i have had a lot of contact with @entity148 over the years , and this is documented			0
she was giving the orders , and chancellors were bowing down			0
" at a @entity168 forum in may , @entity0 said @entity148 must not be " tolerated , enabled , supported			0
" if it 's true that @entity171 gov. @entity170 made traffic the collateral damage of his vendetta , then he is an amateur compared with his neighbor across the @entity176 , who easily made the future of 600 children his collateral damage			1
the second theory is de @entity0 is a true believer			0
maybe he truly believes in the teachers union over students			0
maybe he truly believes in a perverted sense of fairness that demands if everyone ca n't have a good education , then no one should			0
why should you -- in @entity188 or @entity189 -- care about the story of these kids ? why should you care about @entity1 ? because generations -- four decades of children , in every state in this country -- have had a stagnant and subpar education			1
one assessment has ranked the @entity201 education system 17th in the world			0
this is a distorted mirror for anyone who calls himself a progressive to stare into			0
how does @entity0 , or anyone who says he or she stands for the progress of the underprivileged , justify looking at the percentage of minorities who fail to graduate from high school -- in 2013 , 32 % of @entity212 and 38 % of african - americans -- and get rid of a way out for them ? @entity21 was elected on a campaign theme of @entity217			1
what he should see here is a tale of two paths			0
if inequality and opportunity for minorities were more than empty slogans to him , @entity0 would go to @entity19 on his knees , hoping to find something to duplicate , not destroy			1
maybe from that position , the imposing mayor can face his victims			1
i promise , mayor , they 'll look you in the eye .			2

@entity4 mayor decided not to let three charter schools operate in city buildings
@entity241 has a kindergartener who attends @entity19
parents and children are upset ; @entity241 says kids are condemned to failure at a public school
@entity241 : fixing inequality , creating opportunity for minorities are empty slogans for mayor
