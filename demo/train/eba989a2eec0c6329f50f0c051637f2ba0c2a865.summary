what comes in a white cardboard box , weighs little more than a kilogram and can be purchased in a few clicks from @entity4 ? few people would guess a drone -- a term that conjures up stealth strikes and spy movies			2
but that 's the point for @entity11 , a @entity12 company that dominates the young but growing market for personal and commercial drones			1
it wants to make the airborne gadgets , if not soft and cuddly , at least unremarkable			1
" it 's made of white plastic			2
it 's pretty accessible to most people , " says @entity20 , @entity11 's director of aerial imaging			1
the company 's ready - to - fly phantom photography drone makes it a " global leader , " in small unmanned aerial systems according to @entity27 , a research group			1
@entity11 believes drones like the @entity31 will soon become another " camera in your bag , " allowing photography enthusiasts to embrace " dronies " with same fervor as " selfies			1
" " it 's sort of an extension of the selfie stick really , " says @entity20			2
" it 's an unlocking of the third dimension for camera positioning			2
" their latest four - propeller drone is equipped with a high - definition camera and a wi - fi transmitter lets pilots watch the video streamed live to their smartphone that attaches to the controller			0
@entity55 on a three - axis gimbal or stabilizer , the camera can be rotated while the drone hovers in place enabling it to capture stunning aerial images such as close - ups of a volcano			1
transition the company was founded in 2006 by engineer and remote control helicopter enthusiast @entity65 , who started out making kits for hobbyists before launching the @entity31 range in 2013			0
it has expanded quickly , growing from 20 employees in 2009 to 2,500 , who are mainly based at company headquarters in the southern @entity12 city of @entity75			0
operating at the cutting edge of a new technology is rare for @entity12 companies , which are typically regarded as manufacturers of ideas and designs hatched in @entity82 and elsewhere			0
it 's the kind of company that @entity12 needs more of if it wants to make the transition from world 's factory floor to a home for innovative companies with global reach			1
@entity20 says @entity75 marries the best of @entity12 's manufacturing prowess with a rich pool of design and engineering talent			0
" you do n't have to wait eight days for a prototype to come back in			0
" confusing regulation ? its early lead puts it at the heart of the debate over regulation of the drone industry , which has been dogged by red tape , privacy concerns and a poor reputation			1
many fear drones landing in backyards and peering in windows			1
@entity20 says the policy environment is confusing for most users			1
in the @entity116 , amateur drone users ca n't go above 400 feet ( 120 meters ) , and the devices can only be used by hobbyists			1
the @entity119 is working on clearing commercial unmanned aerial vehicles and details are expected by the end of the year			2
other jurisdictions such as @entity124 and @entity125 allow wider use , says @entity20 , and the company 's drones are used in fields ranging from mining and agriculture , to nature conservancy and real estate			2
as drones catch on in the mainstream , the company has built in features to help first - time pilots			1
the device is programmed to avoid airports and automatically returns to a home point if it flies out of range			0
" most people are successful with the product and consider it easy to fly , " says @entity20			0
" that said , it 's still a flying machine so it has the potential to hit things and crash			0
" just do n't call it a drone in an hour - long interview , @entity20 only uses the word " drone " when pressed and says the industry is struggling with the terminology			0
but with " i want a drone " now reportedly one of the top recurring search terms based on @entity166 autofill data and the word widespread in the media , the company says it 's now focused on changing what drone means to people and regulators			0
" it 's really heartening -- once people use them , it 's not a struggle to get them to think of the drone as a generic thing rather than ( something ) scary			0

@entity11 wants to make aerial photography drones mainstream
says drones nothing to be scared of ; allow *creative* photography
regulation over use of drones confusing , especially in @entity116
