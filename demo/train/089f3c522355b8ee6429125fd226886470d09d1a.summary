-- the @entity2 administration had " very detailed contingency plans " for military action against @entity5 forces if they had tried to stop the @entity7 attack on @entity9 's compound , according to two @entity7 officials familiar with the plan			1
their names are not disclosed because of the sensitive intelligence information involved			0
" no firepower option was off the table " during the @entity19 ' 38 - minute mission on the ground , or during the time @entity7 helicopters were in the air , one official told @entity0			1
" we would have done whatever we had to in order to get our men out			0
" the two @entity7 officials also told @entity0 about the plan if @entity9 had been captured alive , which included taking him to @entity29 and then out to the @entity30 in the @entity31			1
all of the senior @entity7 officials in the @entity35 during the assault were prepared to call their @entity5 counterparts if fighting between @entity7 and @entity5 forces appeared imminent , one of the officials told @entity0			2
the seals at all times retained the right of self - defense , and they could have fired at the @entity5 to defend themselves			0
during the time the @entity19 were on the ground , while some were inside the compound , others were covertly placed just outside the compound walls to provide perimeter security and keep people away			0
some of those @entity19 would have been able to speak enough of the local language to communicate with townspeople if they had come across them , one source told @entity0			0
as the assault on @entity9 's compound commenced , the @entity7 had a number of aircraft flying protective missions			1
none of the aircraft entered @entity5 airspace , but they were prepared to do so if needed			0
these included fixed wing fighter jets that would have provided firepower if the team came under opposition fire it could not handle			2
additionally , the @entity68 had a full team of combat search and rescue helicopters including @entity71 and @entity73 helicopters flying			0
the helicopter that came in to replace the crashed stealth helicopter was carrying a battlefield medical team that was flying overhead and ready to land if @entity19 were wounded , one of the @entity0 sources said			1
that helicopter landed at the compound within about thirty minutes of being called			0
@entity7 military and intelligence assets were conducting continuous reconnaissance of @entity5 military installations to watch for any indication of movements , but the @entity5 military never responded while the @entity7 forces were there , one @entity7 official indicated			1
on monday , @entity5 prime minister @entity90 praised the @entity5 military 's response to the sudden arrival of @entity7 forces			2
" the air force was ordered to scramble , " he said			0
" ground units arrived at the scene quickly			0
our response demonstrates that our armed forces reacted , as was expected of them			0
" still , he added , " there is no denying the @entity7 technological ability to evade our radars			2
" even though it was anticipated that @entity9 would resist the @entity19 that assaulted his compound , and therefore be killed , the @entity2 administration had a plan in place for dealing with @entity9 if he was captured alive , according to both @entity7 officials			1
the plan was for @entity9 to be flown back to @entity29 aboard @entity7 military helicopters and then flown out to the @entity30 in the @entity31			1
there was a team of lawyers , medical personnel , interrogators and translators standing by to deal with @entity9 if that was the scenario that unfolded			1
a major concern was to immediately " preserve evidence " and put @entity9 into a legal framework that would ensure he could be charged and tried some day , the official said			2
" we did n't want to have some case thrown out on a technicality			0
" the official indicated the standby teams included the type of expertise normally within @entity7 units in @entity29 , so it 's likely personnel did not even know who their potential target would have been			1
the official noted that @entity9 would have undergone the same type of medical checks and photographing that surrounded @entity140 when he was captured			1
after @entity9 was killed by the @entity19 at the compound , his body was flown back to @entity29 , and then to the @entity30 where he was buried at sea			1
admiral @entity145 , chairman of the @entity146 , placed a phone call to his counterpart general @entity148 asking for @entity7 aircraft to re-enter @entity5 airspace -- several hours after the raid -- so the body could be flown out to the @entity30 .			2

" no firepower option was off the table , " a @entity7 official says
