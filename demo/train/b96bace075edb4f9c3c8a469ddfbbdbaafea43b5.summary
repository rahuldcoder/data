@entity1 , @entity0 -- a web designer in @entity1 was amazed to discover that @entity6 election protesters are attacking the @entity6 president 's web site using software he developed in his spare time , he told @entity2 wednesday			1
@entity15 : " i suppose i am taking sides but i have no problems with it being used in this way			2
" with anti-government activists in @entity6 sidestepping official attempts to silence them on the internet by posting photos , videos and blogs on sites like @entity24 and @entity25 , others are using a site that automatically refreshes a web page every few seconds , potentially overloading the host server			1
the page reboot software means that dissidents can " attack " sites with a barrage of hits -- known as a denial of service attack -- causing them to appear to users as " unobtainable			1
" @entity6 president @entity36 's web sites was one of those displaying this message on monday , according to @entity41 's @entity40 , although on tuesday it was loading correctly			1
the freely available page refresh site was partly developed by @entity15 for use with sports results sites and @entity46			1
he said he was unaware it was being used by @entity6 protesters to stop the government from getting out its message until tuesday when he received an email from an unknown source asking him to take the site down			1
" can you please shout ( sic ) down the website for few weeks			0
currently they are using that website to attack other websites , " stated the anonymous e-mail seen by @entity2			0
@entity15 , who works for contract publisher @entity60 , then discovered that hits on his own site had risen from 700 on a normal day to 41,000 on monday			2
" i was shocked when i heard my site was being used in this way , " the 25 - year - old told @entity2			0
" this exemplifies the power of the internet that something happening in @entity1 can affect events thousands of miles away in @entity73			0
it 's great it 's being used in this way			0
" the heavy traffic forced @entity15 to temporarily suspend his site , but only because it was exceeding the volume of traffic on his server			1
he said he later received dozens of e-mails requesting him to restore the site , and he did so			0
one message seen by @entity2 said : " please bring your site back up as fast as you can			0
we need your help in @entity6 against @entity36			2
" @entity15 said he supported the protesters in their battle to have the results of the disputed presidential election overturned			2
" i suppose i am taking sides because i 've put the site back up , but i have no problems with it being used in this way			0
