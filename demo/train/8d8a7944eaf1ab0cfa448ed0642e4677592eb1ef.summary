@entity0 -- the @entity2 on thursday closed its criminal investigation of the deaths of two prisoners in @entity7 custody , ending a controversial investigation that attorney general @entity9 had approved more than a year ago			1
the investigation , conducted by veteran justice prosecutor @entity11 , examined alleged @entity7 interrogation abuses in connection with prisoner deaths at @entity15 in @entity16 in 2003 and at a secret prison in @entity18 in 2002			1
if the probe had led to criminal charges against @entity7 officers or contractors , it could have ignited a firestorm of objections by @entity27 lawmakers and the national security community			1
@entity9 acknowledged that he made a controversial decision to appointed @entity11 in 2009 to examine allegations of @entity7 interrogation abuses in about 100 cases			1
his aides say he was aware the @entity35 @entity34 wanted the torture controversies put behind it , but @entity9 pressed on			0
@entity27 lawmakers and the @entity7 were upset about the new review of alleged detainee mistreatment			1
in june 2011 , @entity11 concluded that nearly all of the allegations should not be prosecuted			2
however , he said he would look into two cases in which prisoners died while in custody			0
on thursday , @entity9 said no charges would be brought in those cases			0
" assistant u.s. attorney @entity11 has now completed his investigations , and the @entity2 has decided not to initiate criminal charges in these matters , " @entity9 said in a written statement			2
