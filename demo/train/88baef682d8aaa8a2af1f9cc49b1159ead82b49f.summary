-- @entity1 prides itself on being green			1
the gadget maker announced this year that it would power a data center in @entity4 " using entirely renewable sources			0
" and it publishes environmental reports on each of its products , indicating whether they can be recycled and what steps the company is taking to reduce its impact on global climate change			2
but this has been a bad week for the company 's green image			1
" @entity1 computers are falling further from the tree of life and leaving a sour taste in some purchaser 's mouths , " wrote @entity18 , a blogger for @entity19			2
the first bit damaging of news was about @entity1 's decision to dump an international green certification system that is used by the @entity31 government to determine whether its agencies can or can not purchase a product			1
@entity1 would not comment on exactly why it abandoned the @entity35 environmental standard , which measures a product 's recyclability and energy efficiency			1
the @entity39 , however , speculated widely that the company 's new macbook pro line is n't easily recycled since the laptops ' batteries are glued to their aluminum cases			2
and perhaps that was the reason @entity1 decided to pull out now , before those laptops were reviewed by @entity35			0
on thursday , a report from that environmental group challenged @entity1 to tell the public how , exactly , it plans to make its data centers 100 % green			1
" this new ambition to be ' coal free ' is welcome news for the 125 million current @entity57 users , and represents a significant improvement in @entity1 's energy choices , " @entity47 wrote			1
" however , many details and questions remain about how @entity1 will achieve its 100 % renewable goal from the public dialogue @entity47 has had with the company			1
" two of @entity1 's three current data centers operate in regions that are 50 - 60 % coal powered , and will require significant new investment or a clear decision by @entity1 to buy electricity from cleaner sources in order to be considered coal free			1
" because of @entity1 's recent statements about clean energy , however , @entity47 actually raised the company 's grades for the environmental friendliness of its data centers from @entity79 , which it gave the company in april , to @entity81 and @entity82 " as a large and rapidly growing energy user , @entity1 can not be a sustainability leader if it remains a passive recipient of the electricity it is provided from dirty utilities , " the @entity47 report says ( @entity84 )			1
" to show true leadership , the company has to be willing to use its influence to change the electricity ecosystem outside the walls of its data centers as well			0
" specifically , @entity47 says , @entity1 should pressure @entity95 , which it says provides power to its @entity4 data center , to produce energy by cleaner means and to end its " mountaintop coal removal operations " from @entity1 's supply chain			1
in a statement issued to @entity0 by e-mail , an @entity1 spokeswoman said the company 's existing data centers will not use coal energy by early next year			1
" we 're committed to building the world 's most environmentally responsible data centers and are leading the industry in the use of renewable energy , including the nation 's largest private solar arrays and non-utility fuel cell installation , " the statement said			0
" as we 've said before , our @entity4 and @entity119 data centers will be coal - free as of february 2013 and our newest data centers in @entity121 and @entity122 will be designed to meet that standard from @entity124			0
" @entity1 operates a data center in @entity127 , @entity4 , as well as one in @entity129 , @entity121 , the report says			0
the company is planning data centers in @entity132 , @entity122 , and @entity133 , @entity119 , according to the report			0
the location of those data centers is important , @entity47 argues , because data centers -- basically big warehouses full of computers that store data " in the cloud " or online rather than on home machines -- are such big users of electricity			0
@entity1 uses data centers for its @entity57 service , which lets users store music , photos and documents on the internet / where they can be accessed from several devices			1
environmental groups pressure tech companies to locate their data centers in places where green power is available or where less energy will be required to cool the plant			2
data centers account for about 1.5 % of total electricity consumption in the @entity31 , according to a 2007 report from the @entity31 @entity163			0
as tech companies like @entity1 , @entity168 and @entity169 expand the offerings of their cloud computing services , the amount of power going into data centers continues to grow			0
@entity47 's thursday report , titled " a @entity173 for @entity1 , " also calls on @entity1 to take several other specific steps if it wants to meet its goals of using 100 % green energy			1
among its recommendations , it says @entity1 should : buy renewable energy for its data center in @entity121 instead of purchasing renewable energy credits from @entity181			2
create on - site power sources , find a source of biogas and retire its renewable energy credits from on - site power at its @entity4 data center			0
create a policy for future data centers ' locations that prioritizes the availability of renewable energy sources			0
@entity1 did not respond to a request for comment			0
in the @entity47 report , @entity169 , @entity195 and @entity196 generally got better marks than @entity1			2
@entity168 ranked worse than @entity1 , earning fs for transparency and its decisions about where to place its data centers			0
scores for those other companies were carried over from an april report and will be re-evaluated on a company - by - company basis this year , @entity47 says .			2

@entity47 : @entity1 needs to do more to reach its clean energy goals
environmental group *applauds* @entity1 's green ambitions
@entity1 has been catching heat for abandoning a green *electronics* standard
@entity47 gave the company @entity218 and d rankings for the greenness of @entity57
