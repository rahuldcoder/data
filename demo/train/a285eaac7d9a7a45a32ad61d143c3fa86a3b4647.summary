a-listers who appear in the movie include @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			0
( as a softie supportive ex playing against hot - headed - temptress type , @entity40 might be the most satisfying surprise ingredient in the film			0
) @entity14 , who wrote , directed and stars in the film as chef @entity48 , drew inspiration from real life			2
" the food truck scene has definitely become emblematic of @entity29 , " @entity14 tells @entity5			1

" @entity66 a must get as soon as he finished his script for the film , @entity14 says he sought out the consultation services of chef @entity66 , the unrivaled boss of @entity29 's still - booming food truck scene			1

rather than being annoyed by the doppelgangers , @entity66 says he 's honored			1
" a lot of them ( korean - taco vendors ) are putting their own spin on it , " he says			2
" they do n't call themselves @entity73 , so it 's a form of love			2
" " djs all have the same music , the same beats to choose from , it 's which ones you choose and how you mix them up that makes you an original , " adds @entity14			2
" food trucks are our bootleg tapes			0
" humble sizzle @entity29 's food trucks are an extension of @entity109 's long - established " taco trucks			1
" these are typically plain white trucks that sell cheap and freshly made tacos , quesadillas and other @entity53 " fast food			0
" modern " food trucks " -- sometimes owner - operated ( as in " chef " ) , sometimes run by larger business entities -- have taken the mobile food concept and expanded the menu options considerably			2
you can now buy everything from acai bowls to greasy burgers to @entity125 lobster from food trucks			0
the shared lineage means the terms " taco truck " and " food truck " are sometimes used interchangeably -- but should n't be mistaken for the similar - in - appearance white " catering trucks " ( known colloquially as " roach coaches " ) that pull up to construction sites , warehouses and office buildings selling pre-packaged sandwiches , bags of chips , candy and beverages to workers			1

one of the most famous results was the day he parked his truck at midnight on the campus of @entity175 during finals week			0
when he arrived he found almost a thousand students lined up for his tacos			0
" @entity168 , that 's why @entity73 blew up , " he says			2
