@entity1 authorities are looking for possible links between a grenade found at the scene of a drug cartel shootout in @entity6 earlier this month that killed three police officers and an @entity1 who allegedly made similar improvised grenades from parts exported from the @entity1			1
a source close to the investigation says the @entity12 wants to examine the device recovered to see if it bears signatures of a grenade - manufacturing operation authorities allege was run by @entity17			1
the device was found at an october 10 shootout in @entity21 state , between local cartel members and @entity6 police , according to an internal @entity12 report reviewed by @entity25			1
@entity26 was arrested in 2011 and is facing charges in @entity6 for allegedly importing grenade hulls and other parts , and making them into improvised explosives sold to drug cartels			1
@entity12 agents began investigating him in 2010 and federal prosecutors continue to pursue the case			1
an attorney in @entity6 could n't be located			2
@entity6 authorities have been finding grenade hulls allegedly tied to @entity17 for years , sources close to the investigation say			1
following complaints from cartel members that grenades detonated too quickly , he allegedly changed their fusing system over the years , @entity1 bomb technicians found			1
he also told investigators that he taught cartel members his techniques to manufacture grenades , according to two sources close to the case			2
' @entity54 ' entanglement the @entity17 case briefly became entangled in the @entity12 scandal over the botched " @entity54 " gun sting , in which @entity12 agents from the @entity59 allowed suspected arms smugglers to buy about 2,000 firearms , many of which have turned up in crime scenes in @entity6 and the @entity1			1
@entity12 agents hoped to use the sales to prosecute major smugglers , but had no way to track the weapons			1
the discovery of the grenade in @entity21 earlier this month and the @entity12 report that called it possibly a " @entity17 " grenade , has led to reports that the case may be a new " @entity54 " - like scandal for the agency			1
but the cases differ in several respects			0
in early 2010 , @entity12 agents working with @entity6 counterparts attempted a sting operation to nab @entity17 as he allegedly transported grenade parts across the border from the @entity1 to @entity6			1
@entity6 authorities lost track of @entity17 and failed to stop the shipment , according to people close to the case			2
unlike " @entity54 " where @entity12 agents did n't alert @entity6 authorities to the gun sales they were allowing , the agency worked with @entity6 agents throughout in the @entity17 case			1
the matter is under investigation by the @entity97 inspector general , who is expected to issue a report soon			0
members of @entity100 are also tracking the case			0
the @entity12 agent who led the @entity17 investigation , @entity104 , says @entity12 's efforts were complicated by @entity1 laws that treat the grenade hulls as novelty items , easily available at military surplus stores and online			1
it is illegal to export them without license , but there are few restrictions otherwise			0
@entity104 , who was a whistleblower in the " @entity54 " case , says agents working the @entity17 case were frustrated that prosecutors would n't bring charges against him			2
" i want to ensure the public that at no time while under @entity12 surveillance did @entity17 possess or transport live hand grenades , " @entity104 said in a statement			1
" since the items @entity17 possessed are not contraband , we were powerless to seize them inside of the @entity1			2
" @entity6 authorities arrested @entity26 in august 2011 in a subsequent @entity6 operation with @entity12			1
authorities also found his alleged grenade factory where they found parts that could have been used to manufacture about a 1,000 grenades , sources close to the case say			2
@entity12 , prosecutors clash both the " @entity54 " and the @entity17 cases were troubled in part because of bitter fighting between @entity12 and prosecutors in the @entity141 in @entity59			2
agents said a lead prosecutor in both cases , @entity143 , obstructed attempts to bring charges			0
@entity143 remains in the @entity59 office , but was reassigned to the civil section after an inspector general 's probe blamed him for some of the " @entity54 " problems			0
@entity143 did n't return a call seeking comment and a spokesman for the @entity141 declined comment on his behalf			0
in the @entity17 case , @entity158 and other @entity12 agents arrested him in june 2010 in @entity161 and seized 116 grenade hulls and other parts			1
he told investigators that he operated a mill in @entity6 to make grenades and sold them to cartels , according to internal @entity12 documents first reported by @entity169			1
@entity143 declined to bring charges and atf agents were required to free him , according to sources close to the case			0
despite @entity17 's statements to the @entity12 , @entity143 said there was n't enough evidence and that @entity17 could easily claim the grenade hulls were novelty items			2
such grenade hulls are commonly sold as desktop trinkets labeled " complaint department , take a number			0
" prosecutors in @entity59 told @entity97 officials who investigated the matter a different version of events , according to sources familiar with their account			0
they said they wanted investigators to watch @entity17 more and charge him later			0
they also said atf agents wanted to make @entity17 an informant			0
@entity12 agents disputed that account and told @entity100 investigators from the offices of sen. @entity197 , @entity198 , and @entity200 rep. @entity199 , chairman of the @entity202 , who investigated " @entity54			2
" agents investigating @entity17 provided whistleblower testimony to @entity100 about " @entity54			0
" still some mystery a source close to the @entity17 case says if the latest grenade found in @entity21 is deemed similar to those made by @entity17 , it still leaves some mystery of their source			0
that 's because cartel members apparently taught by @entity17 may have manufactured it after his arrest			0
" he was running a grenade - making school and workshop , " one source close to the case says			0
@entity6 authorities and @entity12 technicians noticed a new fusing system in grenades allegedly tied to @entity17 after they began turning up in late 2010 and early 2011 , two sources close to the case say			1
the new fuses provided a three - to - four second delay so cartel members could throw the devices and have time to get away unharmed			0
the devices have been deadly to the @entity6 military and police fighting the cartels , and to rival gangs			1
@entity237 , an @entity12 spokeswoman , said in a statement that " we have not determined the origin of the devices " used in the @entity21 state shooting			2
" the description that was used in a document leaked to the press was a term used by law enforcement who recovered and reported the devices			0
there is no evidence at this time or any indication the device originated from the @entity17 investigation			0
authorities will have to process the devices at the laboratory to determine if there is any forensic connection , " @entity237 said .			0

@entity12 is looking at ties between @entity1 and hand grenades used in shootout in @entity6
agents say explosives bear signature of operation run by @entity267
@entity267 is on trial in @entity6 for allegedly importing grenade parts , *selling* devices to cartels
