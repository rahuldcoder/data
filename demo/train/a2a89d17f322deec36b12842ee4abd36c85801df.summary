@entity0 , @entity1 -- a woman blinded in an acid attack seven years ago said sunday she stopped the " @entity5 " punishment for her attacker because " such revenge is not worth it			1
" a physician was to drop acid -- under legal supervision -- into the eyes of @entity14 on sunday , according to @entity15 , to punish him for throwing acid in @entity18 's face			1
the act disfigured her face and blinded her			2
" i never intended to allow @entity14 to be blinded , " @entity18 told @entity2			1
" ... each of us , individually , must try and treat others with respect and kindness in order to have a better society			2
" @entity18 stopped the punishment minutes before it was carried out , she said , adding that @entity14 already had been given anesthetic			1
she said two men were instrumental in bringing about her change of heart : a doctor at a clinic in @entity34 and @entity35 , an @entity1 who helped her get medical attention			2
@entity35 told her to forgive @entity38 and prove to the world that @entity1 are kind and forgiving , she said			2
however , she said @entity14 is unrepentant and has been rude to her , even after she halted his punishment			1
. this week marks the beginning of the holy month of @entity42 in the @entity44 world , and pardons and commuted sentences commonly occur as a show of compassion leading into the holiday			2
an @entity1 court convicted @entity14 in 2008 of pouring a bucket of acid on @entity53 , after she had rejected his unwanted advances for two years			1
@entity18 had demanded at the time that the court sentence the man to suffer the same fate he had inflicted upon her , and the court agreed , citing provisions in @entity44 law			1
the sentence was to be carried out in may 2011 , but a court postponed it after @entity64 protested against it on the grounds of cruelty			1
restitution in such cases is about $ 200,000 , @entity18 said , but the law dictates she should only receive half of that because she is a woman			1
she argued the issue with the judge , she said , and he told her to speak with lawmakers and convince them to change the law			0
she said sunday she has asked for a meeting with lawmakers and expects to talk with them in the future			0
she said she intends to collect and use the money for her medical treatment			0
she said @entity14 does not have the money , and she has asked authorities to keep him in jail until he pays her			1
@entity18 says she first met @entity14 in 2002 when they attended the same school			1
she was a 24 - year - old electronics student			0
she never noticed him until he sat next to her in class and brushed up against her			0
@entity18 says she knew it was n't an accident			1
" i moved away from him , " she said , " but he brushed up against me again			0
" @entity18 said that over the next two years , @entity14 harassed her and made threats , even asking her to marry him			1
" he told me he would kill me			0
he said , ' you have to say yes			0
' " on a november afternoon in 2004 , his threats turned to violence when he followed her from the medical engineering company where she worked			0
as she walked to the bus stop , she sensed someone behind her			0
she turned around and was startled to see @entity14 , who threw something over her			1
what felt like fire on her face was acid searing through her skin			2
" i was just yelling , ' i 'm burning ! i 'm burning ! for @entity111 's sake , somebody help me , ' " she said			0
the acid seeped into her eyes , and streamed down her face into her mouth			2
when she covered her face with her hands , streaks of acid ran down her fingers and onto her forearms			2
she said sunday that she does not expect others to follow her example of forgiveness , but noted that if they do , " it would prove that they are great human beings			0
" she has published a book in @entity126 , and said she is now trying to write a book in @entity128 about her ordeal and women in @entity1 society			0
" i will be personally responsible for naming names and will answer for it , " she said			0
in 2009 , @entity18 told @entity2 that she had undergone more than a dozen surgeries on her badly scarred face , but still imagined that in the future she would have a wedding day			1
" i always see myself as someone who can see and sometimes see myself in a beautiful wedding gown , and why not ? " she said			0
