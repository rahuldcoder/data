-- a month after @entity2 suspended him for violating its drug policy , @entity1 says he 's coming clean			1
the 29 - year - old @entity5 outfielder apologized in a statement released thursday , saying he used a " cream and a lozenge " banned by the league			2
@entity1 did not specify which drug he used , but his suspension came after baseball 's investigation into @entity14 , the now - defunct @entity15 clinic accused of providing performance - enhancing drugs to baseball players			1
" i have no one to blame but myself , " @entity1 wrote			1
" i know that over the last year and a half i made some serious mistakes , both in the information i failed to share during my arbitration hearing and the comments i made to the press afterwards			0
i have disappointed the people closest to me -- the ones who fought for me because they truly believed me all along			2
i kept the truth from everyone			2
for a long time , i was in denial and convinced myself that i had not done anything wrong			1
" this is n't the first time the 2011 @entity34 and five - time all - star has said he 's sorry and admitted wrongdoing			1
but his statement thursday gave new details about what he did -- and why he did it			1
it all started when he was dealing with a " nagging injury " during the 2011 season , @entity1 said			1
" i turned to products for a short period of time that i should n't have used			0
the products were a cream and a lozenge which i was told could help expedite my rehabilitation , " he said			0
" it was a huge mistake for which i am deeply ashamed and i compounded the situation by not admitting my mistakes immediately			0
" an @entity55 report in june named @entity1 as one of more than a dozen players facing suspension due to a scandal involving performance - enhancing drugs			1
last month , @entity62 @entity61 announced that @entity1 had been suspended without pay for the rest of the 2013 season			1
league and union officials praised him for taking responsibility for his actions			0
at the time , @entity1 apologized in a statement , saying " i am not perfect			1
" @entity1 was the 2007 @entity71 and by the 2011 season , he was considered the cornerstone of the @entity5 franchise			1
he signed a five - year , $ 105 million contract extension and went on to help lead the @entity5 to the playoffs for the only the fourth time in team history			0
his performance earned him that year 's @entity80 mvp award			0
shortly after his amazing season , however , a urine sample taken during the playoffs tested positive for an elevated level of testosterone			0
faced with a 50 - game suspension , @entity1 appealed the decision , and an arbitrator overturned the suspension on what some , including the chief executive of the @entity90 , said was a technicality			2
@entity1 said thursday that feelings of anger and self - righteousness fueled his public comments after the arbitrator 's decision in february 2012			1
at the time , he criticized the process , described himself as a victim , claimed that he was innocent and stressed that truth was on his side			2
" i felt wronged and attacked , but looking back now , i was the one who was wrong , " @entity1 said thursday			2
" i am beyond embarrassed that i said what i thought i needed to say to defend my clouded vision of reality			0
i am just starting the process of trying to understand why i responded the way i did , which i continue to regret			0
there is no excuse for any of this			0
