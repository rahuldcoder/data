-- amid calls for greater openness at the @entity4 and the federal judiciary , the nine justices released their financial disclosure reports friday			1
they did so in the old - fashioned way , in person and on paper			2
the figures reaffirm the members of the nation 's highest court , despite earning a government salary , are generally well off financially , and like to travel			2
the figures show at least six and as many as eight of the nine justices have investments worth at least $ 1 million			1
the reports only require they list only a range from investment income			2
only justice @entity23 listed any financial liabilities , mostly minor credit card debt			1
but a lucrative rental property she owns , her former @entity28 residence , brought in between $ 1 million and $ 5 million last year , although she still carries a hefty mortgage			1
@entity23 also previously earned more than $ 2 million from her popular 2013 memoir , " @entity31			1
" but in the latest financial disclosure , the @entity33 native reported no " non-investment income " last year , indicating royalties from book sales did not exceed her previous advances			1
justices @entity39 , $ 77,000 , and @entity41 , about $ 11,000 , separately listed royalty income from earlier books they wrote			1
and @entity39 earned the annual prize for most traveled justice : 28 separate trips for speeches , lectures , and teaching , including visits to @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54			0
three out - of - town appearances were before the conservative @entity56 , which liberal groups have criticized @entity39 in the past as an ideological conflict - of - interest			0
but other members of the court have also participated in events sponsored by ideological non-profits			0
all nine members of the court reported at least one trip overseas , including to @entity67 , the @entity68 , @entity69 , and @entity70			0
and seven members claimed teaching income from universities , including lectures , which generally earned them about $ 3,000 - $ 20,000 for one or more days of extracurricular work			1
most such stints occur during the court 's three - month recess , scheduled this year to begin in late june , when the last of the session 's rulings will be issued			0
even retired justices have to report their income			2
@entity83 , who stepped down from the bench in 2006 , maintains a remarkable schedule			0
the 84 - year - old said she has 21 positions on various boards and committees , and made 32 separate trips across the country , including promotion for a new book			0
for their day jobs , the eight associate justices earned a healthy pay raise to $ 244,400 , while chief justice @entity97 gets a bit extra at $ 255,500 per year			1
it was the first salary increase for members of the federal bench			0
the @entity102 , an alliance of legal and media groups , has launched a public campaign , urging the court to post its financial reports online , for the convenience of the press and public			2
the president and members of @entity112 already do so			0
" the media have the right to know about any activities public officials engage in that may influence how they conduct the people 's business , " said @entity113 , executive director of the @entity114 and @entity115			0
" that our nation 's top judges make it purposely harder to obtain this information -- especially given the @entity128 -- does not conform to 21st century expectations of transparency from public officials			0
" all federal judges are required to list on annual financial disclosure forms any out - of - town travel for speeches and other appearances that was paid for by private groups .			1
