-- for more than a year and a half , @entity1 was at the front lines of talks between the two sides of @entity7 's civil war			1

and now , @entity1 is resigning from his post , @entity10 @entity14 ban ki - moon said tuesday			2
@entity14 accepted the envoy 's resignation " with great regret , " he said , standing by @entity1 's side at @entity20 in @entity21			1
the resignation is effective may 31			0
the announcement came as a truce between @entity7 rebels and the government showed signs of faltering			1
rebels in @entity30 on tuesday fired upon pro-government enclaves in that town in retaliation for @entity7 troops earlier firing upon the opposition in @entity36 , according to the rebels and an opposition group			1

but government forces shelled @entity63 this week , according to the opposition			2
" the regime 's shelling of the town of @entity63 north of @entity36 , to where rebels of @entity36 retreated in line with a deal organized by the @entity10 , makes evident the falsity of the truces that the @entity77 regime seeks to promote , " @entity65 , a member of the @entity66 , said in a statement tuesday			1
