@entity0 , @entity1 -- about half of the staff of the @entity5 have signed a petition calling for the ouster of the center 's director , saying its " effective functioning " is at stake as the @entity12 hurricane season heads toward its peak			1
@entity5 director @entity16 said he was reprimanded for comments about replacing a key satellite			2
" an unfortunate public debate is now occurring over the ability of the @entity5 to meet its mission , " the petition , released thursday , says			0
" the undersigned staff of the @entity5 has concluded that the center needs a new director , and with the heart of the hurricane season fast approaching , urges the @entity27 to make this happen as quickly as possible			1
" twenty - three people signed the petition -- about half the center 's total staff , but about 70 percent of those who were available and discussed the statement thursday , said @entity33 , a senior hurricane specialist			1
the center 's current director , @entity16 , took over in january after the retirement of @entity38			1
@entity16 caused an uproar last month with comments about a key hurricane satellite called @entity42			0
the satellite is five years beyond its life expectancy and operating on a backup transmitter			0
@entity16 said if it were to fail , forecast tracks could be thrown off by as much as 16 percent			0
he told @entity2 that @entity48 reprimanded him for the comments -- " they wanted me to be quiet about it			0
" but one of the center 's veteran forecasters said @entity16 's comments were misguided			2
" @entity42 is another tool that we use to forecast , " @entity56 said			0
" the forecast will not be degraded if we do n't have the @entity42			0
" the @entity27 this week launched an unscheduled review of the hurricane center after word of the staff 's dissatisfaction started to become public , the @entity60 reported			1
@entity67 center staffers told @entity2 's @entity68 they were not consulted before @entity16 made the remarks and replacing the satellite would not be one of their priorities			2
but they said their dissatisfaction stems not only from @entity16 's comments , but also from the environment at the center -- one of closed doors and the public airing of dirty laundry			1
staffers say they are worried the hurricane center 's mission is being undermined and that public confidence in the center could erode -- meaning the public might not take the center 's storm warnings or evacuation alerts seriously , for instance			1
the statement was not sent to the @entity27 , @entity68 said , but was sent to the @entity92 's public affairs office			2
the @entity5 is under @entity92 's authority			0
