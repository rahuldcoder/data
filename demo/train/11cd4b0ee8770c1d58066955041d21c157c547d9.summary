-- the @entity1 was falling apart			1
more specifically , says guitarist @entity2 , the band 's original master tapes were falling apart			1
" a bit like nitrate film , " he says in a phone interview from @entity6			2
except , instead of burning up , the oxide layers to such records as " @entity11 , " " @entity12 " and " @entity13 " were disintegrating			1
to save them and make proper digital masters , the tapes had to be baked in an industrial oven and transferred to other media			2
" it has been a bit of a restoration , " says @entity2			2
" i do n't think it was a moment too soon , because the tapes were rotting -- mold in the boxes and stuff			1
" but the ultimate result was worth it : spanking - new releases of the band 's catalog in a new boxed set called " @entity32			1
" the collection , which is shaped like a boombox , contains newly remastered versions of the group 's five official albums , as well as three cds of demos and singles , a dvd of video footage , a new edition of the " @entity44 " fanzine , and even some buttons for that classic 1979 look ( denim jacket not included )			1
the box will be released tuesday along with a 2 - cd best - of called " @entity50			2
" the band , of course , broke up long ago -- 1985 , two years after @entity2 was fired			1
though relations were soon repaired , there was never a reunion			2
@entity58 and lyricist @entity57 died in 2002			2
a year later the group was inducted into the @entity60			1
their legacy is indisputable -- and not just in the punk movement			1
indeed , calling the @entity1 a " punk band " is like calling the @entity65 a " merseybeat combo			1
" their music included dollops of rockabilly , reggae , country , rap , soul and jazz , a true mix of styles that made for some of the most exciting records and live shows of the rock ' n ' roll era			2
the boombox , says bassist @entity82 , symbolizes the way the four would share music and ideas			1
" when we would go out on tour , each member of the band had one of these boomboxes , so in a hotel room or backstage or on some street corner we could play music , " he recalls			2
" everybody was playing something			2
" @entity2 and @entity82 talked about the @entity1 's career in separate interviews with @entity0			1
the following has been edited and condensed			2
on their influences : @entity2 : the @entity105 groups over here -- the @entity65 , the @entity107 , the @entity108 , the who and the @entity110			1
i was lucky enough to grow up at the time when they were doing their most fantastic music			2
when you do music yourself , it 's interesting -- it 's like a two - way highway			1
you go back and find out what influenced the people you liked , so you 're going backwards , at the same time you 're in the present trying to do something			2
it led us back to so many @entity128 artists -- blues , soul and rock and roll			1
@entity82 : reggae and rockabilly			1
and mostly reggae , because that 's what i grew up on , and that 's the only music that seemed to me at that time that had something to say for itself			1
whereas @entity142 , progressive rock , it did n't speak to me			2
i could n't relate to it			2
on being labeled as a punk band : @entity82 : i do n't care about it			1
people are going to say what they want to say anyway			2
some people are going to say , ' they 're rubbish			2
' i do n't really care , because i know in my mind what we were			2
we initially started out as a punk band , but we evolved			1
we evolved into quite a magnificent rock and roll band , i daresay			0
@entity2 : we ca n't really deny that 's where we come from , but we always hoped to be more			1
a lot of our contemporaries , if they did make more than one record , they made the same record			0
and of the people i liked , i was really looking forward to their new record coming out , because i knew they were doing something different			0
i knew they were n't going to do the same thing every time			0
that was like a given with us			0
that was only natural -- i always knew we were never going to make the same record twice			1
on their fashion choices : @entity82 : that was my department , really			1
if you go see a band and they look amazing , you get really inspired			0
but if the band looks not very well - dressed , it 's hard to get inspired by the music			1
as our manager said , if somebody goes to see a band , and the audience is better dressed than the band , then why should the audience listen to what the band have to say ? there 's a like - minded thought process going on at this time anyway			1
we do n't want flares , we want straight - leg trousers			0
the whole world 's got flares			1
and everybody 's got long hair -- ( so ) we want short hair			1
it was very tribal , too			0
you had the mods , you had the rockers , you had skinheads , you had hippies , people were very defined by how they looked , and it reflected the music they liked , too			0
on " the only band that matters " : @entity2 : the record company came up with that ; it was n't us			0
we were n't like trying to blow our own trumpets			0
it was kind of a moniker and it stuck			0
every group wants to be the best group when you 're young			1
on becoming stars : @entity2 : i remember once , i was talking to @entity220 ( at a stadium show )			0
i said i know what " quadrophenia " means now , because if you look in one direction , you 're ignoring 50,000 people ! he just looked at me like i was mad			0
it was a big thing , but we had something we wanted to say , so it was interesting to see how we 'd get on in that environment			0
@entity82 : in the early days when we first started out in a hotel room , it was n't a great hotel room , but the hotel was better than where i lived			1
then as the journey continues you get more successful , suddenly the hotel rooms have one big bed in it rather than two narrow beds that you have to share			0
so it 's a gradual thing			1
when you do get to the point where you 're in the lap of luxury , it 's easy to lose contact with yourself and where you 're from			1
in some ways it 's not a bad thing that the @entity1 split up when they did , because we would have become " the only band that mattered " and very pompous			1
so maybe in some ways cutting your own throat was a good idea at the time			0
who knows what sort of people we would be now ? on writing songs with @entity57 : @entity2 : it started off as , " we need another song			0
" " ok , give us five minutes , " and we 'd go upstairs to rehearsals and bang something out			0
at the other end of the scale would be , i do n't want to see him , just post the lyrics through the post box			0
( sometimes ) he would sit at the typewriter and bang it out like a guy who worked at the newspaper , and he 'd pull it out of the typewriter and hand it across the table			0
it was always pretty quick			0
it usually comes naturally , especially with @entity57 's lyrics			1
even the tune was there sometimes			0
it was the words , really , and the music was kind of a vehicle for those words			0
on feeling @entity57 's presence while preparing " sound system : " @entity2 : yeah , it 's impossible not to			1
( because ) it was his words that carried the whole thing , or was the most important thing to it , i like to think he was with us			0
he 's definitely with us through his music , and somehow with us in spirit , as well			1
( sounds a little choked up ) i feel that , anyway			0
@entity82 : no. the reason i say that , is because it 's like each person in the band was an individual			1
we spent seven intense years working together , so you get a pretty good idea of how each other is			0
getting along : @entity2 : we became friends very soon after , that was the main thing			0
i 've had a great time these last couple years while we 've been putting this box together			0
it 's been wonderful to spend time with the guys , and have complete creative control over all our work			2
@entity82 : i see @entity2 and we do things			1
we went to a play once ( in which ) they wanted to use the song " @entity332			0
" they invited us to the play			0
what they did n't realize was that back when the record was being recorded me and @entity2 had like a two - hour argument in the studio about the bass sound			0
i said it needed to be not louder , but a bit deeper			0
so we went to see this play			0
and i heard the song being played back , and it sounded really tinny			0
and i turned to @entity2 and said , " i told you i was right ! " there 's no antagonism anymore			2
we 're sort of grown up now			0
we know that we were really fortunate to be working together at the time that we did .			0
