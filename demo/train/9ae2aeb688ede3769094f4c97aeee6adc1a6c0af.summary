the @entity1 crisis simmered wednesday , if not with actual fighting , then with fighting words from the key outside players in the conflict : the @entity6 and @entity7 , whose foreign minister accused @entity9 of " running the show " in @entity11			1
in an interview with state - run @entity14 , @entity7 foreign minister @entity12 lamented how he felt @entity6 officials were quick to blame his nation for everything awry in @entity1 and to insist @entity18 can unilaterally solve it all			1
@entity12 said that while those in @entity1 's east and south who defiantly oppose the @entity11 - based government are " not puppets " of the @entity26 , such a characterization would describe the relationship between @entity1 's leadership in @entity11 and the @entity6			1
" ( @entity6 ) have , i think , overwhelming influence , " he said			1
" they act in a much more open way , without any scruples , compared to the @entity33 ... you can not avoid the impression that they are running the show very much , very much			0
" as proof , @entity12 pointed to the timing of the @entity1 government 's relaunch of its security operation just after a two - day visit from @entity6 vice president @entity44			1
he claimed acting president @entity48 has " ordered the army to shoot at ... people if they are engaged in peaceful protests , " yet has n't disarmed extremists and what he called " the right sector			0
" some in @entity1 's east are occupying official buildings , defying the @entity11 government and openly siding with @entity7 " after several months of total neglect of their interests , " @entity12 said			1
the minister faulted the new @entity11 government for not doing more , including taking the necessary " first step " to implement an international deal brokered in @entity61 , @entity62			1
about a week after being reached , that deal has done little to defuse the crisis			0
on the contrary , both sides appear to be digging in			0
@entity1 's deputy prime minister @entity67 said wednesday that " the active phase of the anti-terrorist operation continues " in the eastern cities of @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , according to state - run news agency @entity75			1
militants in those cities have shown no inclination to leave the government buildings they have seized or disarm , as was mandated by the @entity61 agreement			2
meanwhile , @entity82 estimates that @entity7 has massed 40,000 troops near its border with @entity1 , which has fueled speculation the conflict could only get bigger and more violent , with @entity7 possibly taking over some , if not all , of @entity1 and possibly neighboring nations			2
@entity12 did n't say any military intervention was imminent , but he did n't rule it out , either			0
" if our interests , our legitimate interests , the interests of @entity7 have been attacked directly -- like they were in @entity95 for example -- i do not see any other way but to respond in accordance with international law , " he told @entity14 , referring to @entity7 's 2008 invasion of @entity98			2
" @entity7 citizens being attacked is an attack against the @entity7			2
" @entity6 vows to defend fellow @entity82 members the @entity6 is n't standing still militarily , sending personnel to allied nations near @entity1 that have grown increasingly wary of @entity7 's military intentions			1
on wednesday , a company - size contingent of @entity110 paratroopers arrived in @entity111 , @entity112 , for training exercises at @entity115 's request			0
they 'll be there through at least the end of the year , according to @entity119 , the @entity6 ambassador to @entity112			0
the contingent is part of " a persistent rotational presence " that @entity124 spokesman rear adm. @entity123 has said will involve four @entity126 - based companies of paratroopers that will go to @entity112 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 over the next few months			0
" @entity112 has been there for the @entity6 , " @entity119 said wednesday in front @entity6 troops standing in formation next to @entity112 troops			0
" today , as the trans - @entity135 community confronts @entity7 's unacceptable aggression against @entity112 's neighbor , @entity1 , a sovereign and independent state , we have a solemn obligation in the framework of @entity82 to reassure @entity112 of our security guarantee			1
" the @entity6 and its allies have accused @entity7 of fomenting unrest in @entity1 since massive demonstrations helped push out president @entity146 , who came under fire for moving @entity1 away from the @entity148 and closer to @entity7			1
the allegations include @entity18 's sending members of its armed forces into the country , providing other support for pro-russian militants or generally contributing to an atmosphere of distrust and instability			1
whatever the cause or culprit , a part of @entity1 -- @entity161 -- has broken off and joined @entity7			2
some in the @entity162 fear that @entity7 will try to repeat that scenario elsewhere in @entity1 and perhaps in other countries in which ethnic @entity7 live or where @entity7 or the @entity165 historically has had significant influence			1
some of those countries include the @entity167 and @entity112 , which , like the @entity6 , are part of @entity82			0
the treaty that defines this alliances states that if any one @entity82 member " is the victim of an armed attack , each and every other member of the alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the @entity183 attacked			0
" as a result , the @entity6 and its @entity82 allies are publicly stepping up involvement in places like @entity112 to dissuade @entity7 president @entity188 from thinking that advancing into these countries is an option , according to @entity190 , a former @entity6 ambassador to @entity82			2
" i think that if we did not take the steps that we are taking now , ( @entity188 ) would think that maybe it 's an option , " @entity190 , who served as ambassador from 2008 and 2009 , told @entity193 's @entity192			0
" ... if we did not do that , i think he would wonder : what would be the response of @entity82 if he did have some ... action there ? " counterclaims over politician 's death within @entity1 itself -- particularly the east and south -- government forces and pro-russian militants continued their unsettling standoff			1
the situation seemed largely peaceful , with hints of violence here and there			0
a @entity1 army helicopter , for instance , was targeted wednesday " by unknown gunmen " in @entity71 , which is about 9 miles ( 15 kilometers ) from @entity72			1
on @entity1 's @entity221 website , deputy minister @entity219 said the helicopter suffered " minor damage " to its blades but was able to land safely , with no injuries to its crew			1
the same could n't be said about the discovery saturday of two tortured bodies near @entity72			0
one of them was @entity232 politician @entity231 , who @entity1 's @entity233 said wednesday died as a result of injuries from torture and drowning			1
@entity238 , an adviser to the interior minister , blamed pro-russian militants for having tortured and " kidnapped " him and others			2
" we have eyewitnesses who testified about hearing the so - called little green men bragging about the murders , " he said wednesday			0
" we have another eyewitness who saw these men alive in the torture cells and who was able to escape			0
" the term " little green men " has become widely used for the unidentified armed men who have appeared in eastern @entity1 in recent days			0
@entity7 has denied they are @entity7 military forces in uniforms that do n't bear insignia			0
yet a @entity257 leader in @entity72 , de facto mayor @entity256 , vehemently denies such allegations , instead blaming the deaths on far - right @entity1 nationalist extremists .			2
