-- in a new book , a " @entity7 " interview and other recent public statements , @entity3 , a three - decade veteran of the @entity4 who rose to become head of the @entity6 , has stoutly defended the @entity4 's use of coercive interrogation techniques on @entity12 detainees			1
@entity3 asserts , for instance , " information obtained from senior @entity12 terrorists , who became compliant after receiving enhanced interrogation techniques , was key to the @entity17 government learning of the existence of a courier who was @entity21 's lifeline			1
" let us turn to what is available on the public record to consider if this is true			0
between november 23 , 2002 , and january 11 , 2003 , the man who @entity12 was grooming to be the 20th hijacker , @entity28 , was interrogated at @entity29 for 48 days , more or less continuously , rousted from bed at 4 a.m. for interrogation sessions that went on until midnight			2
if he dozed off , he was doused with water or given a sharp blast of some especially annoying music by @entity36			0
he was forced to perform dog tricks , often exposed to low temperatures , made to stand in the nude , and whenever he seemed to be flagging , he was given drugs and enemas so the interrogations could continue			0
this abusive treatment caused marked changes in @entity28 's behavior			0
an @entity47 official later noted that he began " evidencing behavior consistent with extreme psychological trauma ( talking to nonexistent people , reporting hearing voices , crouching in a cell covered with a sheet for hours on end )			0
" from the secret summaries of @entity28 's @entity29 interrogations made public by @entity58 , it appears that it was only after the weeks of abuse that he told interrogators that the operational commander of 9/11 , @entity63 , had introduced him to a man known as @entity65 , " the @entity66 , " who had instructed him how best to communicate covertly with @entity12 members once he was in the @entity69			1
in july 2001 , the @entity66 had taken @entity28 to an internet café in the @entity72 city of @entity73 and given him some lessons in secret communications			0
the admission from @entity28 that the @entity66 had given him training in operational security seems to have been the first time that @entity17 officials realized that the @entity66 was a player in @entity12 and a confidant of @entity63 's			1
@entity17 interrogators now knew that the @entity66 had helped train potential hijackers for the 9/11 mission , but as yet there was no sense that he might be @entity21 's key courier			1
@entity3 : harsh interrogations were necessary , legal and effective @entity63 himself was then captured in @entity72 in march 2003 and was transferred to @entity17 custody			0
despite being waterboarded 183 times and at one point kept up for 7½ days straight while diapered and shackled at a @entity4 secret prison in northern @entity96 , @entity63 did not confess to the @entity66 's key role in @entity12 , instead telling his interrogators in late 2003 only that the @entity66 was now " retired			1
" @entity63 's assertion that the @entity66 was retired was curious , as not too many members of @entity12 were known to have retired			2
after @entity63 told his interrogators that the @entity66 was retired , an @entity12 courier by the name of @entity103 told @entity4 interrogators a quite different story			1
@entity103 , a @entity72 , was arrested in mid-january 2004 in northern @entity105 carrying a letter addressed to @entity21 from @entity12 's leader in @entity105 urging that he be allowed to embark on a full - scale war against @entity105 's @entity110 population			2
@entity103 obviously had access to @entity12 's inner circle in @entity72 and so was taken to a secret @entity4 prison in eastern @entity114 , where he was subjected to a variety of coercive interrogation techniques , including being slapped , slammed against a wall , forced to maintain stress positions and deprived of sleep			1
at some point , it is n't clear when exactly , @entity103 told interrogators that the @entity66 was @entity21 's courier and frequently traveled with @entity12 's leader			1
it is quite possible , however , that @entity103 gave this information up to his interrogators before he was subjected to coercive interrogations			0
the @entity128 has undertaken a multiyear study of the @entity4 interrogation program and has generated a 6,000 - page report that will likely be released in some form later this year			2
once that report is made public it will surely definitively answer whether @entity103 gave up this key information about the @entity66 while he was being subjected to coercive measures , or not			2
for the moment , we will have to content ourselves with a press release from the @entity128 dated april 27 that says , " the @entity4 detainee who provided the most significant information about the courier provided the information prior to being subjected to coercive interrogation techniques			2
" this detainee appears to be @entity103			0
@entity145 : a visit to @entity21 's lair @entity63 's replacement as the no. 3 in @entity12 , @entity149 , held that position for only a couple of years before he was arrested in @entity72 on may 2 , 2005 , in the city of @entity153 , 100 miles from @entity154 , where @entity21 himself would soon arrive to live for the next six years			1
a month after his arrest , @entity149 was handed over to the @entity4			0
coercive interrogation techniques ( though not waterboarding ) were used on him			0
@entity149 also told his interrogators that the @entity66 was n't an important player in @entity12 and that it was in fact " @entity161 " who was @entity21 's courier			1
counterterrorism officials later concluded that @entity161 was a made - up name			0
so , did coercive interrogations lead to @entity21 ? such techniques were used on @entity28 , the 20th hijacker , and on @entity103 , the @entity72 @entity12 courier who was captured in @entity105			1
certainly both @entity28 and @entity103 gave interrogators information that led the @entity4 to focus on the @entity66 as a possible avenue to finding @entity21 , which to defenders of these interrogation techniques would seem to prove that they were effective			1
that said , it is quite possible , however , that @entity103 gave up the information about the @entity66 before he was coercively interrogated			0
critics of the coercive interrogation techniques can point out that harsh methods were also used by the @entity4 to get @entity63 and @entity149 to talk , and both those men gave their interrogators disinformation about the @entity66			1
since we ca n't run history backward , we will never know what conventional interrogation techniques alone might have elicited from these four prisoners			0
and there were other key steps along the way to finding @entity21 that had nothing to do with the information derived from @entity12 detainees , whether coercive measures were used on them or not			2
the name " @entity65 " is an alias meaning " the father of @entity199 from @entity66 , " which is hardly a good clue as the population of @entity66 is around 3 million and @entity199 is a very common name			0
the first really big break in finding " the @entity66 " came in 2007 when another intelligence service provided the @entity4 with the courier 's real name , @entity199 , a man whose father had hailed from northern @entity72 and had moved to @entity66 decades earlier			1
still there was as yet no sense that this was @entity21 's key courier			1
the next big break in the case came when the @entity66 in june 2010 made changes in the way he communicated on his cell phone that suddenly opened up the possibility of tracking the location of his phone			0
soon the @entity222 was able to trace the @entity66 's cell phone to the large western @entity72 city of @entity225			2
but the courier practiced very good operational security and would turn off his phone and remove its battery far from where he was living in @entity154			0
on one of his occasional visits to @entity225 , @entity4 agents on the ground tracked the @entity66 and followed his distinctive white jeep 2½ hours ' drive to the east to where he was living in a compound in @entity154			1
living there , too , as we of course now know , was @entity21			0
in sum , @entity4 's " liaison " relationship with another intelligence service , signals intelligence by the @entity222 and good old fashioned spying by @entity4 agents on the ground provided the critical leads that led to @entity21			1
the role of interrogations , whether they were coercive or not , seems to have played only a partial role in the hunt for @entity21 , a tale that is more @entity257 than it is " 24			2

@entity145 : @entity4 learned of @entity12 operative " the @entity66 " through harsh interrogation
he says another series of interrogations determined the @entity66 was @entity21 's courier
@entity145 says it 's not clear if the second *revelation* came before or after harsh techniques
he says key breakthroughs came from another intelligence service and from @entity4 agents
