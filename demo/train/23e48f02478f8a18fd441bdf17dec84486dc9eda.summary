those " @entity3 " requests on @entity2 might be annoying , but they 're not dangerous			1
a warning that 's gone viral on @entity2 , as these things tend to do , claims that the app is malware that accesses your data and spams all of your friends			2
but a top web security firm says that 's not the case			2
" it appears that the warnings are causing much more traffic and wasting more time than the supposedly aggressive @entity2 application , " @entity14 , of web security firm @entity15 , wrote in a blog post friday			1
the cut - and - paste warning , with all the requisite spelling and punctuation errors , has usually been some variation of this : " warning : urgent ! people are getting inquiries allegedly linked to a program called " my birthday calendar "			0
" my birthday calendar " is a malicious application to retrieve data from all profiles			0
it 's very aggressive , just a click makes it starts sending requests to all your friends / contacts			0
if a request comes from me just ignore it ; note please copy and warn your friends " @entity14 says that @entity15 has checked out the app and that " it would be appropriate to classify this chain letter as a hoax warning			0
" @entity50 , the longtime home base for debunking internet shenanigans , has also cleared the app of any wrongoing			2
the phony viral warning circulated once before in december 2011 , according to @entity50			1
that said , @entity14 wrote that the false warning is a good reminder that legitimate @entity2 apps can , in fact , access some of your data if you give them permission			1
if you 're not comfortable with one , do n't approve it			0
and even if you 're careful , apps your friends install can sometimes access information about you , too -- at least as much as those friends can see about you			0
to crack down on how much apps can access , @entity15 advises @entity2 users to visit their app settings page and uncheck the boxes beside information they do n't want shared .			1
