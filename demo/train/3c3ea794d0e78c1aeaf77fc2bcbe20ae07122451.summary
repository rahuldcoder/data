-- does the @entity1 need more rules ? does it need any rules at all ? based on the comments to our story " meet the rules of the @entity1 , " the judgment is decidedly mixed			1
the story explained the origin of the @entity1 's " rules , " originally a set of guidelines / inside jokes spawned by a variety of sources , including the @entity18 , the site @entity20 and 4chan 's @entity21			1
as with many internet memes , however , the concept quickly spread to the mainstream to the point where it 's now fairly routine to run across references to " @entity29 " in blog posts and comment strings			2
some @entity0 commenters , however , were n't going to have any rules under any circumstances			1
" the only rule of the @entity1 is that there are absolutely no rules , " said @entity34 , among others			1
other commenters mentioned one of the best - known @entity1 observations , @entity42 : " as an online discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving @entity46 or @entity47 approaches 1			1
" some wondered why it was n't included			0
we agree : @entity42 should definitely be a part of any set of @entity1 rules			1
( personally , i blame my editor for its exclusion : frankly , the guy is a ... ) with that out of the way , here are 10 more nominations for the list of @entity1 rules			1
ignore them at your peril			0
as an online discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving @entity46 or @entity47 approaches 1			1
( @entity42 ) you can not unsee anything rules 34 - 36 apply to			1
( suggested by @entity71 ) the cake is a lie			0
( suggested by @entity74 ; originated in the video game " portal " ) comment boards tend not to extend the discussion in a productive manner			0
( suggested by @entity80 ) if a new version of anything comes out , half the @entity1 will hate it because they changed it too much , and the other half will hate it because they did n't change it enough			2
( suggested by chewie402 ) for trolls : when in doubt -- or when you just do n't know -- go hostile			0
( suggested by @entity91 in @entity92 ) do n't be a d * * k. ( @entity94 , suggested by @entity95 ) the girl you met online may actually be a guy			0
( suggested by @entity99 ; this is a variation of the classic @entity102 cartoon caption " on the @entity1 , nobody knows you 're a dog			2
" ) if anything you see upsets you , it is your problem , not the poster 's			0
( suggested by readerman ) keep it simple			0
odds are , most people reading this are stoned			0
( suggested by @entity113 ) thanks for playing			0
you can have your @entity1 back now .			2
