the nerds are all right			2
the technologists who built the @entity4 's data - driven approach to campaigning are saddened by the results of the 2014 midterms , a political drubbing that not even even the sharpest get - out - the - vote operation could prevent			1
but they are taking heart in a durable truth : even as @entity12 made impressive strides in digital and data - driven campaigning in 2014 , democrats retain a culture of innovation and an army of campaign geeks that far outpaces their @entity12 foes			1
" it goes back to the @entity22 campaign of 2008 , but even before that , " said @entity23 , ceo of the @entity4 data firm @entity24			1
" so many people came out of the woodwork in that campaign , people with @entity30 , statisticians , programmers , developers , people who ran tech - start ups			1
a lot of them went back to their jobs , but so many of them stayed around			2
they created new companies , they worked on the 2012 campaign , they work at the party committees			2
" @entity12 have gloated about their advancements in campaign science since being infamously outclassed by president @entity22 's voter turnout operation in 2012			1
after a much better year in 2014 , they point with pride to new data programs that allowed @entity12 campaigns to better identify and persuade voters			1
" democrats were telling reporters all the way up to @entity58 that their data would be the difference and they would keep the @entity61 , " said @entity54 , the @entity55 's chief digital officer			2
" as a @entity55 , i 'm glad to hear that they still believe in their data advantage and look forward to 2016			1
" but even the @entity12 's top digital strategists continue look with envy at the technological ecosystem that @entity4 and their allies have constructed over the course of a decade			1
" they are a couple steps ahead in technology , but light years ahead in culture , " said @entity69 , the president of @entity70 , a @entity55 communications firm			2
" @entity4 put a larger emphasis on digital and data and technology , they put more money into it , they are better at sharing it			1
@entity12 are much more guarded in sharing their resources			1
" culture gap the culture gap on vivid display this month at @entity85 , a two - day " un-conference " — their phrase — of more than 2,500 progressive activists and campaign pros who gather yearly in @entity89 to drink , talk shop and swap lessons from the election season that was			2
there is nothing like it on the right			2
one fearful @entity55 blogger called it " @entity99			2
" the gathering — run by the @entity101 , a progressive outfit that trains activists and operatives in the fields of data , digital and organizing — has blossomed since its heady inception in 2006			2
back then , when " netroots " activists were demanding a seat at the @entity4 table after @entity115 's presidential loss , the event was an amateurish meet - up of some 200 web - obsessed @entity4 who convened in coffee shops and college classrooms in @entity89 , @entity120 , and @entity121 to plot strategy			1
today , @entity85 feels like a vegas tech expo for @entity4			1
participants at the @entity125 wandered through a job fair that showcased vendors , labor unions , data houses and political committees from across the progressive spectrum			0
@entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , the @entity142 , @entity143 — all of them were eagerly swapping business cards with the next generation of @entity4 whiz kids			1
panels and training sessions starred political directors and digital gurus from the @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , the @entity156 who walked audience members — many of them field organizers and young digital staffers from various midterm races — through the micro-tactics that worked in 2014 and the ones that did n't			1
one official from @entity155 , the environmental group founded by @entity166 billionaire @entity165 , told a room that the group identified over 350,000 " climate action " voters with the help of five in - house data staffers and a rigorous field program			0
the organization ran 21 field experiments this cycle , testing whether black - and - white mail worked better than color , or if combining messages ( " climate and choice " ) in certain states made a bigger impact on voters than climate - messaging alone ( it did )			0
the unapologetically dorky breakout sessions had titles like " @entity189 ! @entity190 " and " simple tricks to up your a / b testing game			0
" one pink - clad speaker took to a podium to recruit female attendees to the free " women - only " coding classes she was running			0
in the hallways between panels , conversations could seem downright exotic to the untrained ear , as conference - goers joked about " @entity205 curves " and " sucky @entity206			0
" while @entity4 on @entity207 were debating a controversial omnibus spending bill that threatened to keep @entity209 in town through @entity211 , the @entity4 at @entity85 were still focused on the nitty - gritty of campaign life , trying to work out the bugs before 2016 and find the best ways to streamline the software platforms , user interfaces and voter data that campaigns now rely on			1
if anyone had hang - ups about revealing their hard - earned intel to potential competitors , they were n't talking			2
information - sharing , the thinking at @entity85 goes , is n't just good for @entity4 at the ballot box — it 's good for business			1
@entity229 , a data scientist from @entity137 , a targeting firm born out of @entity22 's 2012 campaign , was one of dozens of presenters at the conference promoting products that make campaigning easier and more efficient			0
' democratize data science ' " we are trying to democratize data science , so that organizers throughout the progressive universe can have these data tools at their disposal , " @entity235 told an eager crowd during a plenary session called " disrupt 2016			0
" across town at @entity246 , national party officials tapped the assembled brain power for a day - long post-mortem with over thirty digital directors and data scientists from state @entity4 parties and some of the year 's biggest @entity61 and gubernatorial campaigns , including those of @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258			1
the election results were chastening for the @entity4 tech community , said @entity261 , the @entity153 's digital director			1
" it was a very strong reminder that even the best organizing in the world really only has an impact on the margins , " he said			0
" it 's important to acknowledge that atmospheres still matter , and the @entity271 people will have their say regardless of technology you are going to produce			2
" but @entity261 said the party 's geek squad won , in a sense , by losing			0
he gushed over the ability of @entity4 to " scale down " the tactics of the 2012 presidential campaign to the statewide and congressional level without having the kind of big budget that @entity22 relied on			1
and importantly , @entity261 said , running from behind forces campaigns to re-think their strategies and test new tools and methods			0
" if you are behind , you are willing to take more risks , to do things you were not willing to try before , " @entity261 said			0
" if you are in a really tight race , that means that your budget constraints can be tighter and that sometimes forces you to bring more things in - house or to look for things that can be more efficient , or develop a tool that 's going to help you save money			0
" he pointed specifically to the campaigns of @entity258 in @entity302 , which polished their online fundraising practices by matching their email list against @entity305 and testing how potential donors responded to various messages , and the @entity256 campaign in @entity309 , which invented a new tool that helped @entity4 sign up online to vote by mail			1
the @entity256 campaign tool would check a voter 's submission on @entity315 against the voter file at the @entity153 to make sure their address matched their voter registration			0
if it did , an email was sent from the voter 's email to address to the local supervisor of elections to request a ballot			0
" no printing , no stamps , nada , " said @entity326 , the campaign 's digital director			0
in the end , nearly 20,000 @entity309 voters obtained ballots using the tool			0
@entity326 said their models showed most of them were sporadic voters			0
" democrats this cycle may have lost , but we raised the bar on what statewide and down - ballot races can accomplish online , " @entity326 said			0
" we worked together to innovate , test , share best practices , and build a stronger network and pipeline of talent			0
" @entity349 , an @entity351 - educated analytics specialist who was one of the " cave dwellers " in the @entity22 campaign 's dimly - lit @entity355 data office , estimated that @entity4 campaigns around the country had about 100 data scientists working on their races , with another 100 doing work on independent expenditures and issue campaigns			1
none of them were rookies			0
" these are folks with rich experience with data tools , " she said			0
but @entity349 and others who came to @entity89 for @entity85 stressed , over and over again , that nothing in campaign politics is static			0
@entity12 continue to innovate , issues change , and the technology and data that campaigns rely on is always evolving — from @entity305 's api to the information contained in the @entity4 ' national voter file			1
" our tools are only as good and useful as they can be used in practice , " @entity349 said			0
" if we spend a lot of time creating the most the awesome @entity385 and what organizers really need is a flat - head , then we have completely failed at our mission ... the ongoing commitment on the @entity4 side to testing will really help optimize things going forward			1

@entity12 is making gains in technology
@entity4 still have tech advantage and are n't *worried* about 2014 losses
