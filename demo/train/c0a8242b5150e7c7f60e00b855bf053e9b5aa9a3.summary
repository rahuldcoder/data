after months of frustration with the @entity1 , @entity5 wanted to " at least control his departure			1
" a second source highly familiar with the resignation of @entity5 , and the search for a new nominee , tells @entity0 that in the days before he resigned , @entity5 consulted both @entity22 and @entity23 former senators about whether there was a way for him to stay on the job , and concluded there was not			2
@entity22 sen. @entity29 told news talk 550 radio in @entity31 on the day @entity5 resigned that the defense secretary had recently visited him and expressed his displeasure with the @entity1			1

" behind the scenes one close @entity5 advisor is former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff @entity43			0
it is not clear how closely the two men talked about this issue			0
