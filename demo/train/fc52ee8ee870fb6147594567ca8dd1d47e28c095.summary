-- the pilot or pilots aboard an unresponsive plane that flew from the @entity4 over the @entity5 on friday may have been stricken by cerebral hypoxia -- a fancy term for when your brain is deprived of oxygen			1
the @entity11 ( @entity12 ) scrambled fighter jets to check on the plane and suggested on @entity15 that hypoxia may be to blame			1
before the small plane 's windows frosted , fighter pilots tracking the plane could see a pilot slumped over , a @entity12 official said			1
cerebral hypoxia can happen to pilots if they reach too high of an altitude or if there is a loss in cabin pressure			1
it can also be the result of carbon monoxide poisoning or breathing in too much smoke from a fire			2
there is a progressive reduction of oxygen per breath the higher the altitude			2
every pilot 's reaction to hypoxia is different , according to a the @entity40			1
@entity41 is extremely hard for a person to tell when it is happening to them because the onset of symptoms is subtle			0
in the beginning , pilots may experience an increase in the rate at which they breathe			2
they also may feel lightheaded or dizzy			0
eventually , they will start to lose coordination			0
they will experience tunnel vision and their judgment would become impaired			0
brain cells are particularly vulnerable to a lack of oxygen			0
without it they can die off and cause permanent brain damage			2
when a brain goes without oxygen for too long , the part of the brain that helps with breathing can stop working and can keep you from breathing			1
federal investigators believe golfer @entity69 's @entity68 went down in 1999 after his plane lost cabin pressure during its flight			0
in that case , a low - pressure alarm could be heard on the cockpit voice recorder recovered from the wreckage			0
the @entity40 said his plane climbed as high as 51,000 feet			1
the human body has limited ability to function above 10,000 feet without additional oxygen .			0

cerebral hypoxia can be caused by flying at too high an altitude
it can cause someone to pass out , stop breathing *temporarily* or die
pilots tracking the plane could see a pilot slumped over , @entity12 says
