justice @entity0 has some exciting news : " i shot myself a deer			1
" @entity3 native @entity0 revealed over the weekend that she and conservative colleague justice @entity5 have expanded their hunting forays			1
last year , " he said ' it 's time for big - game hunting			1
' so we actually went out to @entity12 this past fall to shoot deer and antelope , " @entity0 said , revealing some rare inside information about the justices and their interactions with each other outside the court			1
the newest member has become fast friends with one of the most conservative , and had earlier indicated they had been hunting for quail four or five times			1
all this started when president @entity27 nominated @entity0 , 53 , to the high court in 2010 and she made the rounds with senators			1
many of those private meetings involved questions about her views on hot - button issues			2
" the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) has quite a presence in judicial confirmations , " @entity0 told an audience at the @entity37 on saturday			1
" and quite a few senators ask you your views on the @entity44 , " she said			0
while refusing to reveal how she would vote on such cases , @entity0 promised to keep an open mind			2
she previously revealed sen. @entity47 asked her about gun rights , remarking the nominee may not realize how important the issue is to some @entity51			0
@entity0 admitted never having owned or fired a gun before			2
@entity0 : fast facts " but i told the senator if i was fortunate enough to be confirmed , i would go hunting with @entity5 , " she said			1
and that promise has been kept , first joining him on an excursion to a @entity59 - area shooting range and then on several hunting trips			0
@entity0 's point in all this is to reinforce what few @entity51 believe of a court with five more conservative members and four who are more liberal			1
top @entity67 decisions " we get along remarkably well , " she told the @entity70 audience			2
" there are true and genuine friendships			0
it 's true the ( ideological ) disagreements test people 's capacity to work together , but to come back the next day and find your colleague just as delightful as you found him the day before -- we 're all grownups and we manage to do that , and the court is full of great people , " she said			0
" we schmooze more than people think we do , " she added			0
what 's next ? duck hunting , @entity0 said			1
@entity87 at @entity70 ' @entity88 ' the current @entity67 is considered a " hot bench " and not because of the courtroom temperature or the relative good looks of the nine justices			1
" hot " as in the spirited , often competitive oral arguments that have livened up -- or injected chaos into -- public sessions where important legal and constitutional issues are openly debated and discussed			0
one person who thinks it is getting increasingly toasty is chief justice @entity100 , who said on saturday that arguments have " gone too far			0
" " we do overdo it , the bench has gotten more and more aggressive , " said the man who presides over those two - hour sessions			0
" recent appointees have tended to be more active in questioning than the justices they replaced			0
" @entity100 revealed his concerns at a judicial conference in @entity112 , saying he is often put into an uncomfortable position			0
" i 've had to act as an umpire in terms of the competition among my colleagues to get questions out , " he said			0
while not offering excuses , he does say one reason may be the nine justices do not discuss the cases among themselves before arguments			0
" so when we get out on the bench it 's really the first we begin to get some clues about what our colleagues think , " he said			2
" we do tend sometimes to debate each other through counsel			0
" justice @entity132 , who is relatively subdued on the bench , was more blunt about the interruptions of counsel , and justices speaking over each other			1
" trying to get in a question at oral argument is really like trying to grab an item that 's on sale at @entity145 the day after @entity146 , " @entity132 said in his trademark deadpan manner two weeks ago , in a speech at the @entity140			1
no joking justice @entity132 has long had a reputation of taking his job seriously			2
unlike chief justice @entity100 , @entity5 , or @entity0 , he rarely jokes from the bench			1
and for those who do not know him personally or covered him for any length of time , his personal demeanor can come off as harsh or overly intense			0
now some progressive groups have suggested @entity132 's recent behavior was a violation of the @entity157 for @entity51 judges			1
the @entity160 and @entity161 magazine said he acted with " judicial intemperance " and " inexcusable rudeness " at the june 25 public session of the court			0
justice @entity166 , sitting next to @entity132 , was reading an oral dissent , criticizing the majority 's ruling in a workplace discrimination case			1
the isolated media reports said @entity132 , without speaking , rolled his eyes , shook his head , and looked at the ceiling			2
the reporters claimed other incidents of " rude behavior " in the days prior when justices @entity178 and @entity0 also spoke from the bench			1
@entity181 did not witness the alleged incidents , but other justices have long been observed appearing a bit distracted when opinions are read in open session			0
it is a process that can drag on for half - hour or more when the rest of the court must sit in silence			0
the backdrop to all this involves @entity132 's public display during the nationally televised @entity194 by president @entity27			1
@entity132 was among several conservative justices sitting just feet away , when the president attacked a majority ruling on campaign finance reform			1
cameras showed @entity132 appearing to mouth the words " not true " at @entity27 's assertion the opinion would open floodgates to uncontrolled corporate spending in federal elections			1
the progressive @entity206 now says @entity132 's demeanor last week suggested a disrespect for women			1
" perhaps @entity132 felt he could pull the same stunt again because this time , no one outside the courtroom actually would see his antics -- they could only be described by those who were there , " said a blog posting by the group monday			2
cameras are not allowed in the high court			0
those who know the 63 - year - old @entity222 native are privately upset at suggestions @entity132 is personally antagonistic toward women , or to any of his colleagues			1
several people close to him told @entity181 @entity132 is a sensitive , thoughtful man , without affectation or animus			2
they also admit he possesses an often biting sense of humor			0
in a letter to the editor published friday in the @entity160 , two former law clerks called the media reports " character attacks " on the conservative justice			0
" this suggestion is offensive and could n't be further from the truth , as his many female clerks can attest , " said @entity237 and @entity238			0
" those of us who have been fortunate to work closely with @entity132 know that he is a good man who serves every day with humility , dedication and incredible intelligence and insight			2
" @entity132 himself had no comment on the reports .			2
