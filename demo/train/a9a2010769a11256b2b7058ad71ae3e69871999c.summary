she 's a registered therapy dog , but you wo n't find her in hospitals or nursing homes			1
instead , @entity1 makes weekly visits to libraries and schools			1
she sits quietly or snuggles up to kids as they read her a book			1
and no , she 's not napping , and the kids do n't have treats in their pockets			1
she 's actually helping these children learn to read			1
after all , dogs ca n't read			1
how could they possibly help someone learn a skill that they themselves ca n't grasp ? but it 's a growing trend , and it seems to be working			1
children who are just learning to read often feel judged or intimidated by classmates and adults			2
but reading to a dog is n't so scary			1
it wo n't judge , it wo n't get impatient , it wo n't laugh or correct if the child makes a mistake			2
in a nutshell , dogs are simply excellent listeners			2
and for shy kids or slow readers , that can make all the difference			2
@entity38 is executive director of @entity39 , which runs a nationwide program called @entity41 -- @entity42			0
she says there 's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she did n't anticipate : confidence			1
" a factor that we never planned for , that turned out to be really important , is that the child feels like they 're letting the dog understand the story , " she says			1
" they get to be the teacher , the storyteller , the one who knows more than the dog for a change			2
... they just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog			0
" video : @entity1 and @entity65 the children know they 're not actually teaching the dog , of course , but the for the kids , the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one			1
and now that volunteers are aware of that aspect , @entity38 says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher			0
" one of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog , " says @entity38			0
" like if [ the child ] does n't know a word , the dog does n't know the word either			1
and then they 're not alone , and they can look it up in the dictionary together			0
" @entity1 and her owner , @entity65 , participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in @entity95 with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old			1
they 're part of the " sit			0
" program , which is similar to @entity101 like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the @entity105			1
" the kids come in and read stories to @entity1 and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time , " says @entity65 , who was interviewed by @entity106 at the @entity107			1
" it encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it 's a good way to involve families with the library system			2
" ireport.com : @entity65 explains how he and @entity1 got started and then , of course , there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs			0
according to the researchers at the @entity125 for the @entity126 at @entity127 , blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog			0
the @entity130 confirms what any dog owner knows : dogs have been found to reduce stress			1
each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading			2
for older children and teens , the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure			2
@entity38 says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs			0
" a comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely , " she explains			0
" they get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [ of reading ]			0
" it 's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it			0
because they 're volunteer - based , and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level , doing a nationwide study would be difficult			0
however , @entity38 says it 's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who do n't			1
she says it 's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year			1
she 's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year			0
and @entity38 thinks that reading comprehension is just the beginning of how these dogs help kids			1
" it 's not just reading scores , " she says			2
" they start to speak up in class , and volunteer , and finish homework			0
they do n't want to miss school when they 're going to read to the dog , so it improves attendance			2
it kind of just flows over onto everything			0
" @entity41 staff and volunteers know people are skeptical about the program 's results at first , but @entity38 says anyone who 's spent time with a dog will understand			1
" it sounds a little kooky when people first hear the idea , " she admits			0
" but if they know dogs at all , and the way people relate to dogs , it quickly starts to make sense			0
but you do n't quite ever grasp how really lovely it is until you see it happen and you see the kids light up and you see how excited they are			0
you see all these changes in them that they just were n't able to make			0

therapy dogs in libraries can help kids become more *comfortable* with reading
it 's less intimidating for a child to read to a dog than a parent or classmate
spending time with a dog also helps physiologically reduce effects of stress
dogs in libraries and schools are a small but growing trend across the @entity105
