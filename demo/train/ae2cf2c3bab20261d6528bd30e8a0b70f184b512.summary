these days , finding somewhere to live in @entity1 is one of the city 's biggest challenges			1
the @entity5 estimates that 49,000 new homes are required in the @entity8 capital every year to cope with its burgeoning population			1
in 2013 , just under 20,000 new properties were built			2
with space tight and increasingly expensive , some are predicting micro-living -- residency in compact homes and apartments strategically designed to maximize usable space -- could become a common theme in the coming years			1
" there 's huge housing pressure , " said @entity19 , sales and marketing manager at @entity21 , a micro-home developer			1
" the last five years have seen a real population growth in @entity1			1
we 've just crossed 8.6 million and by 2030 we 're going to be knocking on 10 million			2
" according to @entity19 , shaving off excess space in new - build properties can squeeze more people in while still providing all the necessary amenities of city living -- although @entity21 would argue that their 38 square meter properties ( 409 square feet ) are perfectly proportioned			1
" they do n't have any car parking because ( people ) do n't have cars anymore , they have space for bicycles			0
there 's a big living area , and you know to be honest , you do n't need a bath in your bathroom ... a wet room is exactly what 's required , " @entity19 said of the properties			1
@entity21 's development in @entity1 's transport zone two would sell for around $ 350,000 , roughly 20 % below market value			1
special conditions ensure the properties maintain their status as affordable housing			1
" all of the developments are prioritized for sale to people who live or work in the borough ( local area )			0
they have to earn under £ 66,000 ( $ 100,000 ) and they ca n't already own another property , " @entity19 explained demand is far from in short supply			0
" we currently have over 15,000 people registered for it , the demand is unbelievable , " @entity19 said			0
yet even with these conditions , owning a home is still out of reach for many @entity73			0
this is a fact recognized by @entity75 , ceo of @entity76 , another @entity1 micro home developer			0
" we 're now in a position where most people in their first or second jobs , in their early to late twenties ca n't even afford to rent a studio flat or one - bedroom flat , " @entity75 said			0
the collective 's @entity86 development is an upmarket hostel - style set up which is aimed at young professionals featuring small bedrooms , and shared communal spaces			1
individual properties range from nine square meters rising to 20 square meters ( 97 sq ft to 215 sq ft )			2
" our prices here start at about £ 200 ( $ 304 ) a week , " @entity75 explained			0
" that 's all inclusive of all your utility bills , so your gas , your electricity , your council tax and then also the services ... the weekly linen change , the room cleaning , the concierge ; it 's an all - inclusive rent			2
" people are happy to take smaller bedrooms as almost like crash pads , " he added			0
resident @entity111 pays $ 425 dollars a week for 14 square meters ( 150 sq ft ) and finds it suits her needs			0
" when you live in a city and you 're a student or a professional , you do n't want to carry many things with you anyway			2
you want to be quite light , " she said			0
the likes of @entity21 and @entity76 have caught the attention of businesses who are keen to keep their workers in the city			2
@entity21 is popular with local authorities for providing living space for workers near to council offices while the collective is in talks with @entity131 to house its graduate workers			0
and despite the smaller spaces , neither skimps on the facilities			0
the collective has a new 170,000 sq ft project in the works in @entity1 's @entity140 area that will include common facilities like spas , libraries , secret garden rooms , discos , laundrettes and private dining rooms which people can hire out when they have dinner parties			2
" i think it is a new , more permanent approach to living , especially in city centers , because there 's only a finite amount of space so people ca n't build more			1
while the next few years will reveal how successful a concept micro-homes will become , it 's safe to say they 've given many @entity73 an interesting option to consider .			1

@entity8 capital needs to build 49,000 new homes a year to keep up with city 's rising population
some *suggest* micro-homes can offer affordable housing *solution* for many in city
