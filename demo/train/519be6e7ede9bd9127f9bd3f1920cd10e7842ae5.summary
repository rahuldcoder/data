@entity0 pulled their tv advertising in @entity2 from now through election day , leaving @entity5 hopeful @entity4 without air support from the national party , which had invested heavily in trying to unseat the @entity5 's top @entity8			1
it 's a sign of how stretched @entity0 are in defending their own turf across the country that they can no longer afford to go on offense in the marquee race against @entity5 minority leader @entity15			1
but @entity4 sources insist they 'll be fine on their own			0
the campaign , sources said , is flush with $ 4.4 million cash on hand -- much more than other @entity0 on the ballot this year			0
" money is not an issue in this campaign , " a @entity4 source said			0
while the @entity25 is coming off the air , national @entity0 are still likely to spend money on the ground in @entity2 before election day to help boost @entity4 ' get out the vote operation			1
" we continue to make targeted investments on the ground and will continue to assess the race to decide on future television buys , " a @entity25 source with knowledge of the @entity25 's strategy told @entity38			2
the move comes as @entity0 focus their resources on defending the party 's endangered incumbents			1
senators like @entity45 's @entity44 , @entity47 ' @entity46 , @entity49 's @entity48 , @entity51 's @entity50 and @entity53 's @entity52 are all fighting for survival -- and to keep the @entity8 from winning the six seats it needs to capture the chamber 's majority			2
@entity4 has been under fire for twice in the last week -- first in an editorial board meeting , and then in a debate with @entity62 -- dodging questions about whether she voted for president @entity65 -- which led @entity70 's " @entity69 " moderator @entity71 to say that the @entity25 secretary of state had " disqualified herself , " and @entity8 to immediately place that comment in a tv ad			1
a @entity4 source said that question had come up in debate prep , and she answered it the same way she did during monday night 's debate , saying that as the state 's chief election officer , the privacy of the ballot box is " a point of principle with her			0
" the source said @entity4 ' campaign has n't polled on how the fallout over her refusal to disclose how she voted has affected the race , but sees it as a national media - fueled issue			0
" the people of @entity2 accept her explanation , " the source said , adding that " not one person has come up to her to say she needs to divulge " how she 's voted .			0

the @entity25 has gone dark in @entity2 's @entity5 race
the move means @entity4 is *largely* on her own against @entity8 sen. @entity15
*democrats* are focusing their resources on endangered incumbents
