-- after 21 months of bloodshed and a failure by the international community to do anything to stop it , the @entity3 - @entity2 point man on the @entity5 crisis expressed confidence sunday that a political resolution is possible			1
@entity13 's optimism followed talks in @entity15 with @entity17 deputy foreign @entity16 and @entity19 deputy secretary of state @entity18 , which he called " constructive and held in a spirit of cooperation			1
" getting @entity17 on board any international plan is seen as key because it has been an ally of @entity5 's government and blocked tough measures against president @entity29 in the @entity30			1
in a statement , @entity13 said the diplomats " explored avenues to move forward a peaceful process and mobilize greater international action in favor of a political solution			1
" " all three parties reaffirmed their common assessment that the situation in @entity5 was bad and getting worse , " said @entity13 , who was appointed a joint special representative in august , according to a story on the @entity3 news website			1
" they stressed a political process to end the crisis was necessary and still possible			1
" this conviction comes at a time when violence in @entity5 continues to rage			0
@entity3 @entity50 ban ki - moon said friday that more than 40,000 people have been killed , with half a million seeking refuge in other countries and nearly 3 million internally displaced			1
the grim toll grew yet again on sunday , with the opposition @entity55 reporting at least 116 deaths nationwide , including 10 children and four women			2
forty - one of those deaths were in and around @entity61 , and 32 were in @entity62 , including 20 burned near a @entity5 air force intelligence facility			2
in addition to civilians caught in the crossfire , sunday saw more skirmishes involved organized fighting forces on both sides			0
the @entity55 said there were 97 clashes sunday between @entity5 troops and rebel @entity74 members , who have made inroads around the @entity77 country in recent weeks			2
opposition fighters have also taken steps of late to unify their ranks , with disparate @entity74 units agreeing friday to appoint a civilian rebel council leader and a military council leader for each @entity5 province			2
the commanders will be under the leadership of a newly named chief of staff , gen. @entity87 , @entity74 spokesman @entity88 said			0
the united military front follows the creation of the @entity91 , a new coalition of groups opposed to @entity29 's leadership			0
the @entity19 , in particular , has pushed for opposition factions to unite			2
another diplomatic focus has been trying to find a common international approach to @entity5 , in hopes that shared thinking -- especially involving friends of @entity29 -- can hasten an end of the war			2
@entity19 secretary of state @entity101 and @entity17 foreign minister @entity102 joined @entity13 last thursday in @entity103 , @entity104 , to discuss @entity5			1
@entity105 said that meeting did n't produce a " breakthrough , " but it was a start			0
she called for all facets of @entity5 society -- except for @entity29 -- to be part of any transition			0
@entity17 said the countries should brainstorm with @entity13 on a peaceful transition and a political settlement			0
the possibility that @entity5 forces could employ deadly chemical weapons -- something @entity61 has denied -- has heightened the sense of urgency			0
@entity5 forces began combining chemicals that would be used to make deadly sarin gas for use in weapons to attack rebel and civilian populations , a @entity19 official told @entity0 last week			1
that possibility triggered international outcry , including from @entity17 , which sent strong messages to @entity29 warning him he 'd lose their support if he used chemical weapons			0
the @entity19 and some @entity135 allies are using defense contractors to train @entity5 rebels on how to secure chemical weapons stockpiles in @entity5 , a senior @entity19 official and several senior diplomats told @entity141			1
the training , which is taking place in @entity144 and @entity145 , involves how to monitor and secure stockpiles and handle weapons sites and materials , according to the sources			0
some of the contractors are on the ground in @entity5 working with the rebels to monitor some of the sites , according to one of the officials .			0

the @entity3 - @entity2 envoy on @entity5 meets with @entity17 and @entity19 diplomats
he says they " stressed a political process to end the crisis " is still *feasible*
116 were killed around @entity5 on sunday , an opposition group reports
