@entity0 -- to understand how messed up @entity3 politics are these days , examine two votes in @entity5 this week that demonstrated the level of @entity3 dysfunction amid the confusing dynamics of an election year in @entity0			1
on tuesday , house speaker @entity11 and 27 other @entity3 voted to allow the federal borrowing limit to increase , joining nearly unanimous @entity14 support to pass the debt - ceiling measure over the opposition of the other 199 @entity3 members			1
the next day , senate minority leader @entity18 and 11 @entity3 colleagues voted with the @entity14 majority to reject an attempted filibuster of the same legislation by fellow @entity3 sen. @entity3 of @entity23			1
minutes later , all 12 of the @entity3 senators who helped defeat the filibuster bid voted with @entity3 and the rest of the @entity27 against final approval of the debt - ceiling plan , which passed anyway due to unanimous @entity14 support			1
in other words , @entity3 leaders in @entity5 sided with @entity14 to push through legislation opposed by most of their colleagues			1
in the @entity27 , they then voted against the proposal that their earlier support ensured would pass			0
@entity27 passes debt - ceiling plan in blow to tea party election year politics here 's the really strange part -- it all makes sense , at least in the context of a divided @entity3 less than nine months before congressional elections in which every @entity46 seat and 36 of the 100 @entity27 seats will be contested			1
the situations in the @entity46 and @entity27 differed in specifics but shared a common root -- more extreme conservatives foiled plans by @entity3 leaders to avoid a politically damaging showdown over the debt ceiling while still registering @entity3 opposition to increased federal borrowing			1
according to public statements , nobody wanted another debt - ceiling stalemate like those of the past three years that unsettled financial markets and caused the first downgrade of the @entity68 credit rating in 2011			1
a recent @entity1 / @entity70 poll found that 54 % of respondents would blame congressional republicans for a failure to raise the debt ceiling , while 29 % would blame president @entity75 and 12 % would blame both			2
fresh memories of public blame for the 16 - day government shutdown in october also motivated @entity3 leaders to try to steer clear of another standoff			1
however , conservative disdain for anything smelling of more federal borrowing -- especially in an election year -- torpedoed @entity11 's efforts to forge a compromise that would include some deficit - reduction provisions			2
@entity11 's dilemma his final attempt was to tack on a politically popular proposal that repealed cuts to military pensions in the recent budget agreement			0
when @entity11 's caucus rejected it , the @entity95 decided to violate his own rule by holding a vote on a " clean " debt - ceiling plan with no accompanying spending cuts , which passed on tuesday because of strong @entity14 support			1
the @entity46 result offered @entity104 a face - saving chance to avoid any @entity27 @entity3 from having to vote for the debt - ceiling measure			1
he and other @entity3 leaders urged their colleagues to let democrats pass the @entity46 version while @entity3 opposed it , but @entity3 's filibuster bid meant that at least five @entity3 votes would be needed to prevent another @entity0 impasse			1
in a dramatic moment wednesday on the @entity27 floor , @entity104 and fellow @entity3 leader sen. @entity117 of @entity23 cast the two votes needed to reach the threshold of 60 to overcome the filibuster attempt			2
other @entity3 colleagues then changed their votes to provide some political cover , but the damage was done			2
both @entity104 and @entity117 -- longtime conservatives considered @entity75 's harshest @entity27 foes -- face primary challenges from further to the right this year			2
shortly after wednesday 's votes , the campaign of @entity104 's primary opponent in @entity131 , tea party conservative @entity130 , highlighted how the senator helped defeat the filibuster against the debt limit measure			0
@entity11 says ' never mind ' on immigration political pragmatism some @entity3 colleagues praised @entity11 and @entity104 for putting party welfare ahead of personal political risk			2
" it was a very courageous act , especially sen. @entity104 , who we all know is in a very tough race , " said @entity3 sen. @entity142 of @entity143 , one of the @entity3 who changed his vote to help overcome the filibuster bid			0
" he 's the elected @entity3 leader and it 's up to him to cast the right vote			0
" fellow @entity3 sen. @entity151 of @entity152 said the debt - ceiling issue had to be resolved to prevent harmful financial and political fallout			1
" that 's just the reality , " he said			0
" you can deal with it with 60 votes or a majority , but at the end of the day , you had to deal with it			0
" @entity3 was unapologetic , attacking his fellow @entity3 and @entity14 as unresponsive to the rising federal debt			1
" today was a classic victory for @entity0 establishment interests , and the people who lost today were the @entity68 people , " he said			0
as expected , @entity14 offered a different assessment			0
" a real civil war " " it is encouraging that some of my @entity3 colleagues seem to be regaining their grip on sanity this week , " senate majority leader @entity175 said before wednesday 's votes , while fellow @entity14 sen. @entity177 of @entity178 told @entity179 that @entity3 have " a real civil war on their hands			2
" " they have rigid ideologues that are pushing a very narrow agenda , a very narrow view of what @entity68 is , and then they 've got a lot of @entity3 that are not that extreme , and they 're in a big battle right now , " she said			0
" and you see it every day around here			0
" to @entity1 chief political analyst @entity196 , @entity3 put his own agenda of appealing to the tea party right ahead of the @entity3 leadership 's strategy			0
she noted he did the same thing to cause last year 's government shutdown by trying to link federal spending to efforts to dismantle @entity75 's signature health care reforms , which conservatives detest			0
republicans still smarting from that defeat " are looking at @entity3 today and going , ' @entity210 , did n't you learn the lesson of the government shutdown ? ' " @entity196 said , adding that " it 's about him			0
" @entity1 's @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 leaders seek the best of both worlds in election - year politics
on the debt ceiling , they wanted to oppose an increase they knew was needed
the goal was to avoid the ire of conservatives by getting @entity14 to pass it
resistance by the @entity198 wing forced @entity3 leaders to take politically risky steps
