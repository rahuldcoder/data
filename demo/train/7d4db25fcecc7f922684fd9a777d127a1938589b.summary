-- the @entity2 draft , kicking off thursday night , will always bring back special memories for me			1
i was fortunate to be selected in the first round by the @entity8 in 2000			0
the first paycheck i received was for well over $ 700,000 and i had just turned 23 years old			2
this instantly made me the wealthiest person in my family			0
starting tonight , hundreds of young men will be anxiously waiting for their phones to ring with an @entity2 head coach on the other end saying they were just selected to play in the league			1
that call validates all the hard work and understanding of the game , but it does n't teach you how to manage the wealth and business decisions that come with it			1
my agent , the late @entity27 , made me well aware in my rookie year that the @entity2 is a business as well as a game			1
@entity27 would always speak about the business side of the game , league operations and the importance of " not wasting your money			1
" he never advised me what to do with my money or who i should let oversee my accounts			0
his main emphasis was on saving as much money as i could so that when i retired i would n't have to change my lifestyle			0
he taught me that the average draft pick , even one who only plays the league average three to four years , should be able to live comfortably for the rest of his life			1
he might need to work , but does n't need to settle for a profession he 's not interested in			0
these talks were instrumental throughout my career and still play in my head today			0
i never felt the pressure of having to buy a big house , multiple cars , a ton of jewelry or everyone in my family a home			0
i took care of my simple needs -- a townhouse and the car i always wanted			0
the rest of that money i put directly into my money manager account , where i could monitor my funds until i found someone i was comfortable investing with			2
whenever investment opportunities arise , i make sure the pitcher gets vetted by each layer of my team and i insist on a business plan or else we ca n't talk			1
this provides a solid form of checks and balances that allows me to make confident decisions when doing business			1
by making it to the @entity2 , you have defied major odds and will be rewarded for it			1
the top players in this year 's draft will become instant millionaires and others will make hundreds of thousands with their salary and bonus			1
it 's highly unlikely you will make that kind of money once your playing career is over			2
@entity98 's mock draft the reality is that no matter how financially responsible you try to be , money will be wasted			0
it is unrealistic to expect an @entity2 rookie in his early 20s with equal amounts of testosterone and cash not to spend money recklessly at some point			1
for most draft picks , popping bottles in night clubs , picking up tabs for expensive dinners and taking friends and family on extravagant vacations becomes very expensive			0
i have been a part of all these scenarios , but this type of spending is n't generally how players lose all their earnings from the @entity2			1
the majority of financial woes come from untrustworthy financial advisers , family members , poor business deals , second homes and other low - return investments like restaurants , bars , nightclubs and music studios i have been fortunate to have received terrible financial advice only once causing me to take a loss			2
this advice came at a cheap price compared to the millions of dollars lost by players i know personally			2
unfortunately , the people you should be able to trust the most can be the ones to cause you the most harm			0
you 've got to keep it simple			0
i would estimate that 60 % of the @entity2 players i 've known over my 11 - year career have had some type of money issue			1
i do n't mean bankrupt , but they are unable to sustain the lifestyle they should be living after a successful @entity2 career			1
many players never stop for a minute to think about the much smaller paycheck that comes after football			1
even if you retire with a few million dollars in your portfolio , the boredom of no longer having a routine will get the best of you			0
halfway through my career i got even more serious about educating myself for life after football			0
the @entity2 offers business , entrepreneurship and other educational workshops			1
@entity98 's full draft coverage right now i am enrolled in @entity168 's @entity167 executive business program , which builds on the unique experience of individuals with personal brands and creates a customized degree in business education			2
i also co-host on @entity174 and do color commentary in @entity176 for @entity8 preseason games with my old teammate and friend , @entity181 winner @entity180 , who has already received his @entity182			0
it was extremely important for me to be a student of my finances , business and other interests outside football			2
it led to the discovery of other interests and opportunities that i am pursuing now that i am retired			0
now that i 've set myself up financially , my " simple " filter has more of a focus on looking for opportunities that will help me continue to learn and grow			0
my football career gave me that opportunity , to be able to enjoy the rest of my life with financial stability and focus on things i 'm passionate about			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204			2

@entity204 says @entity2 players can live comfortably for the rest of their lives if they make smart decisions
he says players need to know the @entity2 is a business , not a game
@entity204 says players need to prepare for the much smaller paycheck that will come when they leave the @entity2
