does n't the most recent episode of " keeping up with the @entity5 " feel more as though it were an e ! production than one by @entity8 ? has n't it been as predictable , brief and of itself , as inconsequential as a @entity2 marriage , as odious as @entity12 and as certain to lead to unhappiness as @entity15 's reputed drug problem ? does n't the pinheaded disconnect from reality seem familiar ? the problem is that it is easier to deal with the @entity20 than their counterparts in the @entity23			1
we can just change the channel			1
the reality is , we all depend on the @entity28 government in enough ways that letting it turn into a repetitive , meaningless form of basic cable melodrama would be a formula for national catastrophe			1
we should therefore try to draw lessons from this round of @entity38 follies : what we must fix if our country is not to go the way of @entity2 and @entity43 's marriage			2
here are five critical problems we must address			1
the political system is broken gerrymandering has caused @entity48 districts to be essentially " owned " by one party or the other			1
that makes general elections irrelevant			0
so it is primary voters who determine who runs , and they tend to be the more energized , activist voters of the left and right wings			0
the result ? extremes are rewarded and virtually ensured of re-election			0
add to that campaign finance rules that give disproportionate power to big money , and incumbents and @entity66 rules that give the minority and individual senators too much power , and you have system in which gridlock is virtually institutionalized			1
we need campaign finance reform , an end to gerrymandering and rules reform in both houses of @entity79 , and we need to make these initiatives a top political priority of @entity28 's centrist majority			1
our national conversation has gotten off - track promote extremist politicians and reward them for their extremism , and you get tension , incivility and a reluctance to embrace the compromise that is essential to democracy			1
bring in the language of religion and culture wars , and the debate becomes about what divides us rather than what we need to bring us together , about our problems and not about their practical solutions			1
@entity102 issues then play a greater role in campaigns than new ideas			0
opponents become enemies rather than neighbors with alternative views			0
we need to defuse the language , edit the loaded terminology , reinvest in the separation of church and state and call out dangerously divisive ideas , racism , sexism and sheer stupidity , like denying science , history or basic arithmetic			0
governance has become a lost art the least - valued skill set in @entity123 is the ability to actually get things done			1
we mistakenly believe that articulating a problem is the same thing as solving it			0
we reward those who give good speeches and not those who have a proven track record of fixing things			1
politicians are too often elected because they advance an ideology , and when they serve , they inevitably focus on what they need to do to be re-elected			0
but their jobs were created to serve the public , to govern and to lead , even if that means making their positions of power more precarious			0
we need to start voting for people who have proved their skill at bridging partisan divides and focusing on the needs of the electorate			0
we are ignoring the really big problems we are trapped in a cycle of punting problems ahead a few months and chipping away at the margins of issues			1
when this shutdown / debt - limit crisis is finally resolved , we will have a few months until it recurs			1
if a deal is struck before another crisis happens , it will be incremental			0
yet @entity28 has much bigger issues : a too - slow recovery from a great economic setback , an inability to create good jobs at the rate of past recoveries and , perhaps above all , a failure to address the growing inequality that is dividing our society			1
it is not just an economic quirk that 90 % of the benefits of the current recovery are accruing to the top 10 % of our society ; it is a formula for social breakdown and national decline			2
it is also profoundly unjust			0
we need to start demanding that leaders address these bigger issues			0
the @entity28 people have failed their government ... and each other you ca n't blame the politicians			2
you turned away from the system			2
you did n't run for office			0
you did n't write your views down and pass them along to people in power			0
you did n't fund campaigns that supported people committed to big solutions			2
you have become ill - informed , caught up in the name - calling and the partisanship and the climate that created the @entity123 we have today			1
you 've got the government you deserve			0
remember , according to the @entity198 , the top job in the @entity28 government goes to the voter			0
if these clowns in @entity123 ca n't get it right and you do n't fire them , you deserve what you get			1
this is not reality television , even though it feels as pointless			2
and reality , in this democracy , is what the voters make of it			2
you ca n't blame @entity213 or @entity214			2
scarily enough , the tv screen , whether it shows the @entity20 or @entity8 or cable news , is just a mirror , a reflection of what @entity28 wants and is			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			1

@entity222 : " keeping up with the debt limit " seems like a seamy reality show
he says our political system is broken , national conversation is off - track
@entity123 ignores really big problems , focuses on everything but governing , he says
@entity222 : ultimately , we *'re* to blame for not going to ballot *box* and forcing change
