@entity0 , @entity1 -- an anti-insurgent provincial governor who had survived @entity6 assassination attempts was among 20 people who died friday in an explosion at a northern @entity1 mosque during prayers , a government official said			1
the blast in @entity1 's takhar province killed @entity14 provincial governor @entity13 , who recently sounded an alarm about the threat of insurgents during an interview with @entity2			1
the bombing also wounded 35 others , with most of those killed and injured engaged in prayer , said @entity23 spokesman @entity22			1
" it is a terrible incident , " said @entity22 , who said police were trying to find out more details about the strike and who is responsible			0
the @entity30 - led command condemned the attack , saying that " it 's unconscionable that anyone would attack a mosque			1
" " it 's clear the insurgents have no respect for the most holy of @entity44 places , " said @entity36 rear adm. @entity35 , spokesman for @entity30 's @entity38 , or @entity38			1
the @entity46 @entity45 in @entity0 deplored the act , saying " whoever was responsible " for striking a house of worship " has demonstrated a clear lack of disregard for the @entity1 people and for the peaceful religion they practice			1
" the mosque was bloodied and its roof was shattered , eyewitness @entity55 said , but there were different early accounts on how the strike was carried out			1
gen. @entity61 , commander of the @entity23 's northern zone , said a suicide attacker apparently sitting next to the governor detonated a bomb			0
@entity66 , a @entity67 governor spokesman , told @entity2 that a pre-placed mine exploded			0

@entity13 , who was a pashtun , had survived several assassination attempts by the @entity6 , and his brother was slain a few months ago			1
he told @entity2 on sunday that for the last two years , the security situation has deteriorated in @entity14 because insurgents decided to destabilize northern @entity1 , which , until recently , had been relatively stable during the nine - year - old @entity1 conflict			2
the @entity67 blast and the thursday killing of a @entity82 soldier in the north illustrates a growing unrest that contrasts with the first years after the @entity6 's collapse in 2001			2
in those days , the north was much more secure than the predominantly ethnic @entity88 south and east of the country			0
@entity13 told @entity2 that the insurgents were trying to use @entity14 as a launchpad to destabilize northern @entity1 and the wider @entity93 region and lamented the lack of police available to battle insurgents			2
