-- doctors will often prepare for surgical procedures by opening instrument and supply kits that contain up to 100 items			2
many of these items , such as scalpels , needles or sponges , go unused ; they 're just not needed for that particular procedure			1
but because of government or hospital regulations in the @entity14 , they are frequently thrown away , even when they are still wrapped			1
" there are thousands of tons of medical supplies thrown away every day that are unused or clearly reusable , " said dr. @entity16 , a cardiologist in @entity17			1
fortunately , some nonprofit organizations , including @entity16 's @entity24 group , are finding ways to salvage these items and get them to people who need them desperately around the world			2
in @entity32 , for example , many medical facilities lack the necessary supplies and equipment needed to perform surgery			1
the outlook is normally grim for children such as @entity38 , who was diagnosed with a brain tumor when she was 7			2
but one @entity41 hospital , @entity40 in @entity42 , has been able to operate on @entity38 and more than 1,100 other kids thanks to its partnership with @entity45 , a nonprofit that collects surplus supplies and equipment from the @entity14 " brain tumors happen to children all over the world , " said @entity47 , executive director of @entity32			1
" the main difference in @entity32 is that there are so few resources			0
but we were able to save @entity38 with supplies we get from @entity45			1
" ' our trash becomes their riches ' in the @entity14 , surgical supplies are n't the only useful medical items tossed away			1
@entity61 , one of the @entity62 of 2011 , collects discarded wheelchairs through his nonprofit , @entity64			1
with help from another @entity14 - based nonprofit , @entity67 , the wheelchairs are refurbished by senior citizen volunteers and prison inmates in @entity70 before being shipped to rural @entity71			1
@entity72 first visited @entity71 in 1997 , and he met many people with disabilities who did n't have access to wheelchairs , walkers or canes			0
" i was shocked to see people using branches for crutches , being pushed in wheelbarrows and crawling , " said @entity72 , who lost the use of his legs during a skiing accident in 1976			0
now , he has a permanent residence in @entity71 and continues to do everything he can to help the people around him			0
" we want to distribute the more than 75,000 wheelchairs we estimate get thrown away in the @entity14 every year , " he said			1
" what we call our trash becomes their riches , and it makes an incredible difference in their lives			2
" a win - win for everyone in addition to saving lives , there 's another benefit to sending unused supplies abroad			1
" we are diverting a certain amount of waste that would be landfilled , " said dr. @entity111 , a professor of anesthesiology at @entity113 and founder of the nonprofit remedy			2
" at the end of a surgical procedure , our staff surveys the scrub table where the kit items remain and segregates all the materials that have been unused , " @entity111 said			1
" it gets sent down to ( a ) decontamination area , and @entity113 undergraduate students sort through it and take what is useful			0
from here , it is packaged in bulk and given to a charity to be taken overseas			0
" sometimes , perfectly good equipment is thrown away			2
" why would ( hospitals ) throw out a working sonogram machine or a working hospital bed ? " @entity16 said			2
" one , it 's not pretty enough			0
secondly , there might be new technology available			0
in general , no one wants to use a 2005 ( model ) if a 2012 is available			0
" occasionally , a hospital will simply switch brands and get rid of an entire line of unused items			2
supply manufacturers have been known to send items directly to the nonprofits if a box is so much as dented in transport -- items that could mean life or death for an individual in a @entity156 hospital			1
the need greatly outstrips the supply " on my first trip to @entity161 , the hospital director showed me a patient dying of malaria , " @entity16 said			0
" he showed me a room with hundreds of bottles of medicine that would save his life , but ( the medicine was ) not given to him because they had no intravenous lines			0
" that day , our @entity24 container arrived with reconstituted iv lines and 3,000 to 4,000 syringes			0
the doctor got an iv line , the patient got the medicine and was saved			0
" but while unused medical equipment is saving many people around the world , only a small percentage of hospitals ever actually receive these items			1
" if you look at the volume of appeals we get versus the amount we are able to help , we are able to find funding for a quarter of the bona - fide projects , " said @entity187 , chief advancement officer for @entity45			0
" there is a great need out there			0
" the effort to find more funding is worth it , said @entity200 of the @entity201			0
her nonprofit works in four @entity161 countries and has been able to help more than 100,000 people there thanks to surplus medical supplies from a couple of hospitals			1
" if we can do this with the help of just two @entity14 hospitals , imagine how many more could be served if others got involved , " @entity200 said .			1

@entity156 hospitals are saving lives with discarded medical materials from the @entity14
these supplies are clean , safe and unused but are thrown out for various reasons
by salvaging surplus supplies , nonprofits are also reducing waste in @entity14
