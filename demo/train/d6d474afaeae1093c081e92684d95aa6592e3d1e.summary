@entity0 -- attorney general @entity2 says he sees " racial animus " in strident @entity5 opposition to some @entity7 administration policies			1
some media conservatives say he 's playing racial politics			2
@entity2 on sunday told @entity15 's " @entity14 " that " there 's a certain level of vehemence , it seems to me , that 's directed at me ( and ) directed at the president			2
... there 's a certain racial component to this for some people			0
" @entity2 said he also stood by comments from a 2009 speech in which he said @entity25 is a " nation of cowards " on race and sees a crop of new voter identification laws , many of them passed by @entity5 - controlled state legislatures , as a way to disenfranchise minority voters			1
some conservative figures accused @entity2 and the @entity36 of " playing to the fears and anxieties of minorities in hopes of scaring them to the polls in november , " as @entity44 opinion writer @entity43 wrote in an editorial for the paper on monday			1
" the willingness of the @entity7 administration to stoke racial divisions for political gain is astounding , " @entity43 wrote adding that the voter identification laws are intended to ensure " ballot integrity " and that there 's no proof they suppress minority votes			1
former @entity57 @entity5 congressman turned conservative radio host @entity58 tweeted : " simple question for @entity2 and all others who use race to protect @entity7 : is it possible to oppose @entity7 and not be a racist ? " the @entity64 , a conservative newspaper , said @entity2 had " thrown down the race card			1
" opinion : why @entity2 remarks made white people mad both sides are echoing a refrain sounded throughout @entity7 's presidency but the volume is so loud that neither side can hear what the other is saying , experts say			1
for example , @entity2 's claims speak to subtle institutional racism that is sometimes harder for those in the majority to recognize			2
" that 's how racial animus or hostility works -- it does n't require people to be conscious about it , " said @entity82 , an african - american studies professor at @entity83			1
as attorney general , @entity2 is likely speaking to some sentiment held by the @entity7 administration , said @entity92 , an african - american studies professor at @entity93			1
" i rarely think of @entity2 being rogue in his comments , " @entity92 said			2
" he is just the one who is allowed to speak that way publicly			0
" and not all conservatives are motivated by race , said @entity98 , an associate professor of political science at @entity100			2
" i have no doubt there are conservatives who disagree with the president on policy grounds , " @entity98 said			0
" and i think people need to examine their hearts sometimes and examine the ways in which stereotyping informs the ways we view things			0
" @entity2 : ' we are at a dangerous time ' even former @entity5 vice presidential candidate @entity117 's call to impeach @entity7 factors into the hot air surrounding race and politics , experts say			1
" the reason why this comes up is that the people who support her score higher on the racial resentment battery , " @entity98 said			0
all of this means that voters should take a long and introspective look at what motivates their reactions to politicians and policies , experts say			0
" @entity135 can manifest itself in lots of ways			0
and nobody gets a free pass on this , " @entity98 said			0
" sometimes you are more likely to be supportive of people who are like you and less likely to help people who are not like you			0
when that manifests in the workplace or in politics it is an issue			0
