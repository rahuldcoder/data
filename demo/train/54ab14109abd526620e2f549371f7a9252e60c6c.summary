and he has never been prosecuted			0
but since 2005 , a handful of women have made the claim			0
this year , those accusations resurfaced , and on monday , a seemingly harmless post to @entity7 's confirmed @entity17 account turned them into a social media storm			1
in its wake , one of his accusers , @entity20 , turned to the public once more with an article in the @entity27			0

she considered him to be her mentor			0
she spent time in his home , which included dinners with the star			0
she said the abuse began after she turned 18			0
despite what she said was happening to her , she kept coming back			0
and @entity7 and her agent financed her apartment in addition to supporting her acting ambitions , she said			1
she was afraid to talk to her agent about her concerns , and she felt @entity7 's influence over her was too powerful			1
" i was terrified of him , " she said			0
" as a teenager , i tried to convince myself i had imagined it			0
i even tried to rationalize it : @entity7 was going to make me a star and this was part of the deal , " she wrote in her @entity27 article			1
in a friday morning interview on @entity0 's " @entity63 , " @entity29 said she went to a lawyer in 1989 to discuss legal action against @entity7 but " he laughed me right out of the office			1
" after that , @entity29 said , she " just gave up " and moved on with her life			0

@entity0 reached out to @entity7 's representative for comment on this article but has not yet heard back			1
when asked about the allegations saturday during an interview on @entity80 , @entity7 did not respond -- instead shaking his head " no , " according to the interviewer , @entity82			1
" there are people who love you who might like to hear from you about this			2
i want to give you the chance , " @entity82 said , to silence from @entity7			1
" the @entity17 on monday , the comedian -- or whoever was in charge of his social media -- put out a challenge with a jovial picture of @entity7 in a cap : " go ahead			1
meme me ! # cosbymeme			0
" the @entity98 immediately reacted , but probably not in the way @entity7 expected			1
" @entity101 , have you seen my ... nevermind , found my raping hat ! " tweeted @entity103 over the cap picture			0
" my two favorite things ( -- ) @entity108 & rape , " tweeted @entity106 over a photo of @entity7 smiling			1
by nightfall , @entity7 's original tweet had been pulled from the @entity112			1
but in the social media age , the rape allegations have stubbornly remained in the open			1
in late october , comedian @entity116 bluntly attacked what he perceived as @entity7 's " smuggest old black man public persona " by saying , " yeah , but you rape women , @entity7 , so turn the crazy down a couple notches			1
' i do n't curse onstage			2
' well , yeah , you 're ( a ) rapist , so i 'll take you saying lots of m * * * * * f * * * * * s on ' @entity7 : himself ' if you were n't a rapist			1
" a couple weeks later , @entity7 was booked on @entity132 's talk show , but the allegations reportedly gave the staff " cold feet , " according to @entity136			1
@entity7 's booking was " postponed at his request , " the website reported in an addendum			1
( @entity7 did do interviews with @entity143 and @entity144 without incident			1
) for years , @entity7 has denied the rape allegations			1
in february , after @entity148 ran an interview with one of the purported victims , @entity147 , @entity7 's representative said , " this is a 10 - year - old , discredited accusation that proved to be nothing at the time , and is still nothing			1
" nine years ago , when @entity157 was interviewed by @entity158 on the " today " show , his lawyer issued a statement : " miss @entity147 's allegations are absolutely false			1
mr. @entity7 does not know the name @entity147 or ( maiden name ) @entity164 and the incident she describes did not happen			1
the fact that she may have repeated this story to others is not corroboration			0
" in the case of @entity170 , who sued @entity7 in 2005 over an incident the year before , @entity7 says the sex was consensual			2
@entity173 airs allegations at the time of @entity170 's lawsuit , @entity7 had been in the news for a sexual affair once before			1
in 1997 , a woman named @entity180 claimed to be @entity7 's love child			1
@entity7 admitted to a relationship with @entity180 's mother but denied paternity			1
@entity180 was later convicted of extortion			0
however , it was n't until @entity170 's lawsuit in 2005 that the comedian was accused of rape			1
@entity170 , a staffer for @entity191 's women 's basketball team , said in her suit that @entity7 -- a @entity191 alum -- had become a mentor to her in the months since they met in 2002			2
in early 2004 , he invited her to his house in suburban @entity196			0
@entity170 told @entity7 she was feeling stressed and @entity7 gave her three blue pills , which he described as " herbal medication , " according to her suit , which was posted on @entity199			2
then , her " knees began to shake , her limbs felt immobile , she felt dizzy and weak , and she began to feel only barely conscious , " the suit continued			0
@entity7 then gave her another drug , she said , and led her to the sofa , where she says she was sexually molested			2
" when @entity210 awoke , her clothes and undergarments were in disarray , " the suit said			0
@entity170 later returned to her native @entity212 , where she reported the incident to police			0
authorities in @entity216 , @entity217 , followed up with an investigation , but that february declined to press criminal charges due to a lack of evidence			0
@entity7 's lawyer , @entity222 , told @entity0 the allegations were " utterly preposterous " and " plainly bizarre			1
" @entity7 appeared surprised by the allegations			1
" looking back on it , i realize that words and actions can be misinterpreted by another person , and unless you 're a supreme being , you ca n't predict what another individual will do , " he told the @entity225 in march 2005			2
@entity233 filed a civil suit in march 2005			0
@entity170 's lawyers said they found 13 @entity237 witnesses with similar stories			0
however , @entity233 's suit was settled in november 2006 , and the witnesses were never called			0
terms have not been disclosed			0
the influence of @entity7 tarnished reputation as @entity246 's recent @entity7 biography makes clear , the man has his demons			2
he had affairs while on the road and there have been bumps in his long marriage to his wife , @entity253			0
but @entity246 , a former @entity0 managing editor , told @entity0 that he did n't feel comfortable airing the rape allegations			1
" basically , i knew that i was going to have to be very careful in what i said about his private life			0
i felt that way as a journalist and also for legal reasons , " he said in an interview about the biography			2
" in the case of these other allegations , basically because there were no definitive court findings , no independent witnesses , it did n't meet my standard for what i was going to put in the book			2
" " i also was very aware that if i just did a she said - he said , and i printed allegations and denials without my own independent reporting , first of all it 's not really in the spirit in the book , but also every person who then reviewed or reported on the book would be free to repeat those unconfirmed allegations just because they were in my book			2
and i just did n't feel comfortable being responsible for that			2
" still , the rape allegations are always just a mouse click away			2
not long after @entity233 's accusations hit the media , @entity147 went public with her claims on " today			2
" a few months later , another @entity237 , @entity288 , also spoke out			0
@entity29 came forward in 2006			0
@entity157 and @entity29 both gave interviews to @entity148 in early 2014			0
how all the controversy has affected @entity7 personally is unknown			2
he 's still scheduled to star in an @entity292 sitcom next year , and his skills as a comedian appear undiminished			0
last year 's concert movie , " @entity295 , " earned mostly positive reviews , and his recent comedy tour has also received praise			0
but his once - sterling reputation has taken a hit			0
the @entity27 , @entity301 and the @entity302 have all mentioned the rape allegations in stories , criticizing @entity7 to varying degrees .			1
