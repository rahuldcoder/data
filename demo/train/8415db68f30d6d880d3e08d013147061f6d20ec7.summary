-- for most @entity4 clubs , qualifying for the @entity2 is a reason for great celebration			0
for @entity13 , if his @entity9 team can pull that off for a 16th successive season , then it will represent something of a " @entity15 " -- and strong @entity18 © @entity17 vu from the last campaign			2
saturday 's 2 - 1 victory at @entity21 lifted the @entity23 side up into the fourth and final qualifying place in @entity26 's @entity25 , raising hopes among fans that they might yet again be watching top @entity4 football in 2013 - 14			1
@entity23 rivals @entity31 can reclaim that coveted position with victory at home to @entity35 on sunday -- and even go third if @entity36 lose against sixth - placed @entity37			1
and with runaway leaders @entity38 having all but sewn up a record - extending 20th title ahead of monday 's derby with second - placed champions @entity42 , the fight for minor placings is much more intriguing			1
failure to qualify will be a bitter blow for any one of the capital trio -- for @entity36 after last season 's heartbreak ; for @entity31 's ruthless owner @entity52 after yet more big - scale investment in the team ; and for @entity13 as it would raise the chances of his 17 - year reign coming to an end			1
then there are the financial implications : just qualifying for the @entity2 group stage this season was worth $ 11 million for each of the 32 teams , plus television money and a $ 1.3 million bonus for each match victory -- rising substantially until the final , where $ 13.5 million is on offer for next month 's winner			2
" it will be difficult and edgy until the end but the only thing i can say is that we are ready for a fight , " @entity13 said after two goals from @entity69 put @entity9 ahead against eighth - placed @entity21 before defender per @entity72 's sending - off led to a penalty by @entity74			1
" we now we have one target -- to win our games			0
then we do not have to look at @entity36 or at @entity31			2
if we lose our games , you have always to look at the results of the others			0
" that does n't work in our job			0
you have to focus on you , and you win the games			0
" it happened last season when @entity36 blew a 10 - point advantage to allow @entity9 into third place , and then missed out on the @entity2 when fifth - placed @entity31 won the final in @entity92			1
that gave @entity13 a stay of execution , despite extending @entity9 's trophyless run to seven seasons , but this time the 63 - year - old @entity98 has been under even more pressure after embarrassing exits to lower league sides in the domestic cup competitions and mixed @entity25 results			1
his team went out of the @entity2 at the last - 16 stage against @entity106 on away goals , though a defiant victory in @entity109 raised morale after a 3 - 1 mauling in the home leg			1
" we have shown two aspects of our game today , " @entity13 said			0
" one that was very in control and with technical quality , and one that is less known -- fighting spirit , a resolute attitude and battling qualities that reflect well the spirit we have in our side			0
" i believe that since november we have been on a good run in the @entity25			0
we have made 22 points out of the last 27 but our target is to continue to do that until the end of the season			0
" in saturday 's other results , @entity132 moved out of the bottom three with a 3 - 1 win at @entity135 , as @entity137 striker @entity136 wrapped it up with his 15th league goal this season and 19th overall			1
@entity140 stayed bottom on goal difference below @entity143 after losing 2 - 0 at home to new manager @entity146 ' former club @entity145 -- who sacked him in january after a five - game unbeaten run			2
@entity145 climbed up to 11th place , seven points clear of the relegation zone , after a third successive win for new @entity155 manager @entity154			0
ninth - placed @entity156 came from behind to draw 2 - 2 with @entity157 , as @entity159 forward @entity158 scored his 17th league goal this season for the @entity163 club before fellow striker @entity164 earned a point .			2

@entity13 *praises* @entity9 's attitude after claiming fourth place in @entity25
saturday 's 2 - 1 victory over @entity21 raises hopes of a @entity2 place
