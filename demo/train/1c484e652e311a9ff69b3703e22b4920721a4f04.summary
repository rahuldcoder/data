-- mayor @entity1 is not creating two cities , despite @entity4 's view in a recent opinion piece about the series " @entity7 " that 's airing on @entity0			1
there have been two cities here for a very long time			0
in fact , @entity9 differs very little from other major metropolises in the @entity12 in demonstrating the disturbing and growing gulf between the wealthy and the poor			1
@entity1 is no more the creator of that problem than @entity4 is the creator of a tradition of fighting it			1
this is the city of @entity20 and @entity21			2
this is the city of the @entity24 riots			2
this is a city with a long heritage of leaders and fighters , people who found new ways to bridge the divides in an effort to dismantle a corrupt and unfair system			1
this is not about an individual			0
this is about a broken system and the best ways to try to repair it and its ill effects			2
many of those leaders hailed from the privileged class , using their disproportionate cultural and economic resources to fuel their fight			0
( i flatter @entity4 and me by placing us within that group			0
) on the night when @entity1 was found on a swing rather than at poetry readings by @entity51 youth , he was participating in another well - established and problematic tradition : soliciting money from the wealthy to support social causes unsupportable through the political system			1
specifically , @entity1 was lending his cultural clout to my organization , @entity58 , and its efforts to create free public programming in some of @entity9 's most underserved areas			1
he was lending his support to @entity63 , a new signature event for @entity9 that seeks to create a platform for underheard voices and overlooked stories			1
more pointedly still , rather than meet the @entity68 poets from the @entity51 neighborhood , @entity1 was in another neighborhood , @entity71 , helping to raise money for a @entity58 event , which features @entity74 as a core partner			1
take last summer , when @entity58 and @entity74 partnered to create public poetry and drumming events in a dozen overlooked and neglected public parks			0
this effort , too , demands private fundraising			0
put the mayor on a swing , sit him on a platform and serve him expensive treats , drag him from this group to that for a photograph			2
like walking around patting young black kids on the head , as @entity4 says he does in @entity92 of " @entity7			0
" this is part of the job			0
as he wrote in the opinion piece , @entity1 is not an educator or a mentor			1
he is a career politician , and this is his work : stumping for causes			0
@entity1 has been in office less than three years			1
he inherited immense budget problems featuring an unimaginable pension debt			1
he walked into a long history of social and cultural neglect , to say nothing of our flailing national economy that is exaggerating already untenable economic disparity			0
he is also a lifetime politician in a system that is utterly broken , where the only way to get into a position of political power depends on a preternatural capacity to raise money			2
let 's not oversimplify the problem or demonize some single person as its symbolic head , as though we could lop it off and send the problem to a hasty end			1
these are complex problems with complex solutions that demand collective and productive engagement			2
the first step may well be forming unexpected coalitions , such as artists and the politicians whose job it is to represent them , their interests and those who want to hear from them			0
i 'm all in .			0

@entity136 differs with opinion piece *blaming* mayor @entity1 for division in @entity9
he says @entity1 inherited a city already *deeply* divided between rich and poor
@entity136 says the mayor has to do best he can to cope in a flawed political system
he says it 's a *mistake* to oversimplify @entity9 's problems and blame them on one person
