@entity0 will remain part of the @entity2 -- along with @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 -- following a historic referendum vote			1
by 55 % to 45 % , a majority of voters rejected the possibility of @entity0 breaking away and becoming an independent nation			1
shortly afterward , @entity11 , the @entity0 first minister and leader of the pro-independence @entity13 , announced his resignation from both posts , effective in november			1
@entity11 said he was proud of the campaign for independence , and that now was the time to hold the @entity2 leadership to its promises of shifting more autonomy to @entity0			1
" we now have the opportunity to hold @entity26 's feet to the fire on the ' vow ' that they have made to devolve further meaningful power to @entity0 , " he said in a statement			2
" this places @entity0 in a very strong position			2
" @entity2 prime minister @entity33 welcomed @entity0 's decision in a televised statement outside 10 @entity36 , saying it was a clear result			1
" like millions of other people , i am delighted , " he said			0
@entity33 said he would have been heartbroken to see the @entity2 broken up -- but paid tribute to the efforts of both sides in the campaign			1
" we hear you , " he said to those who voted for independence , adding this was an opportunity to change the way people in the @entity2 are governed , and " change it for the better			1
" his government has delivered on devolution in the past and will deliver on it again , @entity33 said			2
a " new and fair settlement " will be created for @entity0 and for the other countries of the @entity2 , he said			1
@entity11 accepted defeat in an earlier televised statement -- and urged the rest of the pro-independence camp to do the same			2
he thanked @entity0 " for 1.6 million votes for @entity0 independence " and said the turnout -- which electoral officials said was 84.6 % from an electorate of more than 4.2 million -- was one of the highest in the democratic world for any such vote			1
@entity69 said the outcome of the vote will be met with a range of emotions , but was hopeful " that these emotions will be tempered by an understanding of the feelings of others			1
" " now , as we move forward , we should remember that despite the range of views that have been expressed , we have in common an enduring love of @entity0 , which is one of the things that helps to unite us all , " the @entity69 said in a statement			1
sigh of relief the final result in the referendum was 1,617,989 votes in favor of independence from the @entity2 to 2,001,926 against			1
this means the pro-union camp won by a margin of 55.25 % of the vote to 44.65 % -- a much wider gap than opinion polls in the final days leading up to the vote had suggested			1
the result means the main political parties in @entity26 -- and many people across the @entity2 and @entity0 -- can breathe a collective sigh of relief that the threat of a breakup of a centuries - old union is over			1
however , many on the " yes " side will be bitterly disappointed			0
the referendum was closely watched around the world , particularly in nations like @entity111 , whose @entity113 province is home to a vocal independence movement			0
@entity118 president @entity117 welcomed the result and praised the @entity0 " for their full and energetic exercise of democracy			2
" " through debate , discussion , and passionate yet peaceful deliberations , they reminded the world of @entity0 's enormous contributions to the @entity2 and the world , " @entity117 said in a statement friday morning			1
" we have no closer ally than the @entity2 , and we look forward to continuing our strong and special relationship with all the people of @entity135 and @entity5 as we address the challenges facing the world today			2
" @entity139 secretary general @entity138 also welcomed the news that the @entity2 , a key member of the defense bloc , would remain united			2
investors liked what they saw			0
the pound was firm against the @entity118 dollar and the euro , after recovering much of the ground lost earlier this month when surveys suggested @entity0 was on the brink of abandoning the union			2
stock markets also rose , with shares in @entity0 companies doing particularly well			2
@entity155 ' @entity11 , who heads the governing @entity13 , hailed the political engagement seen in @entity0 during the campaign and appealed for unity going forward			2
" today of all days , as we bring @entity0 together , let us not dwell on the distance we have fallen short			0
let us dwell on the distance we have traveled and have confidence that a movement is abroad in @entity0 that will take this nation forward , and we shall go forward as one nation , " he said			0
@entity11 has previously said that if the " yes " campaign lost the referendum there would not be another vote on independence in a generation			0
labour lawmaker @entity172 , who led the pro-union campaign in the @entity0 referendum , hailed the result friday but said that the message that the people of @entity0 want change must be heard			1
" the people of @entity0 have spoken , " he said			0
" we have chosen unity over division and positive change rather than needless separation			0
" today is a momentous result for @entity0 and also for the @entity2 as a whole -- by confirming our place within the union we reaffirm all that we have in common and the bonds that tie us together			1
let them never be broken			0
" he gave a commitment that the political changes promised by the @entity26 parties -- involving the devolution of more powers to @entity0 -- would be kept			0
@entity197 also called for the country to unify after debate that " has created some fairly deep divisions in our country , " and a campaign " that has both energized but at times divided " the @entity0 people			0
" those divisions now need to be addressed and that requires leadership , " he said , promising to play his part			0
@entity0 teens face historic vote @entity213 : radical package of powers deputy prime minister @entity213 , whose @entity216 are in a coalition government with @entity33 's conservatives , said he was " absolutely delighted " by the result			1
" but a vote against independence was clearly not a vote against change and we must now deliver on time and in full the radical package of newly devolved powers to @entity0 , " he said			1
" at the same time , this referendum north of the border has led to demand for constitutional reform across the @entity2 as people south of the border also want more control and freedom in their own hands rather than power being hoarded in @entity26			0
" @entity237 leader @entity236 also hailed a " historic achievement " in keeping the union together			0
he promised change across the @entity2 in a speech to supporters in which he looked forward to the general election battle due next may			2
the first of the 32 councils to declare all went to the " no " campaign , as did the capital , @entity250 , which voted overwhelmingly to stay in the union			0
@entity251 and @entity252 also voted " no. " @entity253 delivered a solid win for the independence camp but the lead was not big enough to overturn the " no " camp 's overall majority			2
@entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 were the only other councils to vote " yes			0
" political fallout @entity0 has had a devolved government since 1999 , meaning many , but not all , decisions are made at the @entity266 in @entity267 , @entity250			0
as opinion polls showed the lead held by the " no " vote shrinking fast in the days leading up to the referendum , the leaders of all three main parties in @entity26 responded with the promise to give major new powers over tax , spending and social welfare to @entity0 if it stuck with the @entity2			1
now the party leaders face the challenge of pushing those changes through a possibly rebellious @entity266 on a tight timetable			0
the process of handing over those new powers will start from friday , @entity33 said in a speech in @entity287 earlier this week , with draft legislation expected as soon as january			0
" this is a timetable that is now agreed by all the main political parties and set in stone and i am prepared to work with all the main parties to deliver this during 2015 , " he said			0
although @entity0 has chosen to stick with the union -- staving off potential calls for his resignation -- @entity33 will still face political fallout over the vote			1
critics have accused him of complacency during the long months of campaigning when @entity11 's " @entity304 " campaign was laying the groundwork for its late surge			0
@entity33 's longtime @entity237 rival , former prime minister @entity307 , is credited by many with bringing the vital energy that eventually carried a lackluster " no " campaign to victory			1
critics have also accused @entity33 and the other main party leaders of giving away too much in a last - ditch effort to keep @entity0 voters on board			1
it remains to be seen how the promise to give greater powers also to @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 will be borne out			0
@entity33 will also likely face difficult questions over his own leadership in the run - up to a general election due to take place next may .			0

@entity69 says she hopes " emotions will be tempered " by understanding
final results give pro-union camp 55 % of the vote to 45 % for independence camp
