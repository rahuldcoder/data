-- if you 're a @entity3 fan , times right now are as dark as one of 007 's tuxedos			2
the next @entity3 movie has been put on hold because of @entity9 's lingering financial troubles			1
and no one knows when , or even if , a @entity3 movie will hit the big screen again			1
but this week , the promise that appears at the end credits of every @entity3 film ( " @entity3 @entity16 ... " ) is being kept by a pair of video games			1
@entity19 is releasing two new @entity3 games -- " @entity21 " for the @entity22 and " @entity23 : @entity24 " for the @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 -- and the voice and image of current @entity3 star @entity30 appears in both			1
@entity19 's @entity31 boldly declares : " this is the @entity3 event of 2010			1
" like @entity3 at the beginning of a mission , these new games face potentially hostile territory			0
with two years gone by since the last @entity3 movie , " @entity38 , " it seems the only place you see the phrase , " @entity3 ... @entity3 , " these days is in the financial pages			1
will @entity3 fans raise their martini glasses to toast 007 's long - awaited return in these games ? or will @entity3 's absence from the pop culture radar cause fans to put out their own burn notice on the missing superspy and move on to something else ? " fans are going to be very happy with it , " promises @entity52 , lead producer for " @entity23 : blood @entity55			2
" he believes " @entity24 's " original story ( written by @entity59 , who 's co-written screenplays for three @entity3 films ) , international locations and intense action sequences will satisfy gamers and @entity3 film devotees alike			1
" the [ game 's ] cinematic presentation will take a lot of people by surprise , " says @entity52 , who also cites a new @entity3 girl -- singer @entity55 , who performs in the game and sings its theme song			2
" we 're definitely going to do [ @entity3 ] justice			0
" the makers of " @entity21 " have to pull off more than just doing @entity3 justice			0
that new @entity22 game is an update of the classic 1997 " @entity81 " game for the @entity78 , which itself was based on the 1995 film that introduced @entity80 as @entity3			1
the game is still widely considered one of the best shooting games ever			0
" @entity81 's " makers are well aware that tinkering with a classic can be as dangerous as messing with @entity86 when he 's cranky			2
" it was a massive thing when we found out we were going to working on this , " says " @entity81 " lead producer @entity88			0
" you have to live up to the best shooter of all time			0
" the new " goldeneye " has gotten a fresh coat of paint for its relaunch			0
the dialogue has been adapted to suit @entity30 's man - of - few - words style ; the 1990s setting of the original has been updated to resemble a 2010 world ; and unlike the original , the new " @entity81 " will have an online multiplayer option			1
but even with all the changes , @entity109 insists , " we did n't stray too far from ' goldeneye ' -- it still is ' @entity21			0
' " " it was a bold choice on their part to remake such a favorite , " says @entity110 , host of @entity113 's video game review show " x-play , " about the " @entity81 " update			1
@entity110 , who has yet to play the new @entity3 games , fears some gamers might slam the new " @entity21 " for straying too far from the beloved original while others may slam it for not having changed enough to suit the times			0
" it runs the risk of making absolutely nobody happy , " she says			0
and both @entity3 games have to deal with another pitfall : despite being reliable million - plus sellers , @entity3 titles generally do n't get much respect in the video game world			2
" they just were so forgettable , " @entity113 's @entity110 says of 007 's past gaming ventures			0
" they did n't really appeal to the core gamer			0
" with a few exceptions , most notably the original " @entity81 " game and 2003 's " @entity141 , " too many previous @entity3 games suffered from uninspired gameplay , recycled storylines and a rushed , thrown - together feel			1
that spotty record might make gamers wary of giving 007 another shot			0
still , the makers of the new @entity3 games are confident there are enough @entity3 - deprived fans out there to make " @entity24 " and " @entity81 " hits			1
the question now is : will those folks who ca n't see @entity3 on the silver screen be satisfied to play @entity3 on their video - game consoles ?			2
