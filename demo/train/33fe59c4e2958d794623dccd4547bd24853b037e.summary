-- sunday morning we awoke to breaking news of another tragic nightclub fire , this time in @entity4			1
at last report the death toll exceeded 230			2
this tragedy is not without precedent			2
next month will mark the 10th anniversary of a similar nightclub fire in @entity11			1
at this sad time , it 's appropriate to reflect on what we 've learned from club fires -- and what we have n't			1
@entity11 's station nightclub fire of 2003 , in which 100 concertgoers lost their lives , began when fireworks set off by @entity23 , an 80s heavy metal band , ignited flammable packing foam on the club 's walls			1
deadly blazes : nightclub tragedies in recent history panicked patrons stampeded toward the club 's main exit , and a fatal pileup ensued			1
contributing to the tragedy were illegal use of pyrotechnics , overcrowding and a wall covering that would have failed even the most rudimentary flammability tests			1
video images of the station fire were broadcast worldwide : a concert begins ; the crowd 's mood changes from merry , to curious , to concerned , to horrified -- in less than a minute			1
you 'd think the world would have learned from it			1
the following year , the @entity50 nightclub in @entity51 went up in flames , killing 194 people			2
the club was made to hold about 1,000 people , but it was estimated that more than 3,000 fans were packed inside the night of the fire , which began when fans began lighting flares that caught the roof on fire			1
echoes of the past : @entity11 victims ' ca n't help but watch ' then , in january 2009 , at least 64 new year 's revelers lost their lives in a nightclub in @entity69 , @entity70 , after fire ignited its ceiling			1
many were crushed in a rush to get out of the club			2
in december of that same year , a fire in a @entity78 nightclub , ignited by pyrotechnics , killed 156 people			1
overcrowding , poor exits , and indoor fireworks all played roles in these tragedies ; yet no one bothered to learn from mistakes of the past			1
while responsibility for concert disasters unquestionably lies with venue operators , performers and promoters , ultimately , we , as patrons of clubs and concerts , can enhance our own safety by taking a few simple steps			0
the @entity99 urges concertgoers to : be observant			2
is the concert venue rundown or well - maintained ? does the staff look well - trained ? as you proceed to your seat , observe how long the process takes			0
could you reverse it in a hurry ? do you pass through pinch points ? is furniture in the way ? once seated , take note of the nearest exit			0
( in an emergency , most people try to exit by the door they entered , which is usually not the closest , and is always overcrowded			0
) then , share the location of that nearest exit with your entire party			0
agree that at the first sign of trouble , you will all proceed to it without delay			0
once the show begins , remain vigilant			0
if you think there 's a problem , leave immediately			0
do not stay to " get your money 's worth " despite concerns about safety			0
do not remain to locate that jacket or bag you placed somewhere			0
no concert is worth your life			0
better to read about an incident the next day than be counted as one of its statistics			0
read more : how to protect yourself in a crowd to be sure , all fire codes must be vigorously enforced , and club and concert hall operators must be held to the highest standards			2
a first step is banning indoor pyrotechnics in all but the largest , stadium - type venues			2
but , ultimately , we are our own best " fire marshals " when it comes to avoiding , and escaping , dangerous situations			1
we can still enjoy shows			0
but it is up to us to look out for our own safety			0
in coming days , @entity11 will follow the unfolding news from @entity4 with a sense of queasy deja vu -- the rising body counts , the victim identification process , the grieving families , and the assigning ( and dodging ) of blame			0
if only they had learned from our tragedy			2
eerie sounds of cell phones amid disaster adds to first - responder toll the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			1

pyrotechnics , overcrowding , poor exits have contributed to tragic fires in recent years
you would think the world would have learned from past incidents , @entity171 says
concertgoers have to be their own fire marshals , he says
