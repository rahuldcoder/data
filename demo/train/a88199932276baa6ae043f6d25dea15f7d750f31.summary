-- the rev. @entity1 was fond of quoting his version of the @entity3 5:3 - 5 passage that discusses the positive impact adversity can have on one 's life			2
" suffering builds character , character breeds faith , and in the end faith will not disappoint , " @entity1 often said in speeches			0
he could have been describing @entity14 's 27 years in prison , and lifelong fight for freedom			1
since @entity14 passed , a narrative has emerged that he entered prison as a violent revolutionary and emerged as a nonviolent peacemaker and reconciler			1
that is , at best , revisionist history			0
@entity25 did not turn @entity14 into a pacifist , but it may have turned him into a realist aware of the difficulty of healing the racial wounds in his country			1
when @entity14 was released in 1990 , i was in @entity33 covering it as a reporter , traveling with @entity1			1
i recall the throngs of people that awaited @entity14 and marveled at the scene			2
when i spoke to @entity14 in a brief interview , he hinted at how his time in prison affected him			1
" how do you not hate white people ? " i asked him			0
" if i had allowed myself to become bitter , i would have died in prison , " he said			0
his ideals never changed in prison and never softened his stance against apartheid			0
" i am not prepared to sell the birthright of the people to be free , " he said			0
@entity14 was offered many times to be released from prison if he had been willing to make certain concessions about his anti-government views			1
what i believe did change during @entity14 's time in prison was his view of what it would take to move his country forward after the end of apartheid as a free and democratic country for all @entity33			1
his truth and reconciliation policy allowed the country to heal			2
it allowed black @entity33 to learn what happened to their loved ones who disappeared			0
it brought closure and opened the door to forgiveness			0
beyond the country 's healing , it also demonstrated that @entity14 would be the president of all @entity33 , not just a black @entity33			1
@entity14 and his fellow freedom fighters fought to end the evil of apartheid -- not simply to beat down the perpetrators of it			2
keeping his eyes on that prize and not allowing himself to be consumed by hate helped shape him into the leader that a new @entity33 needed , and one we can admire			0
no one can say what @entity14 would have been like if he had not gone to prison			1
but perhaps it is safe to say that without that time in prison , he would have been different : no less charismatic , no less brilliant			0
because what prison helped @entity14 understand was that even a black president who had been denied full citizenship in his country could not let hate -- even the anger that hate begot -- have the last word			1
if he did , @entity33 could not move forward			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity108 .			2

@entity108 : @entity14 's leadership was shaped by his 27 years in prison
prison did *n't* turn @entity14 into a pacifist but perhaps a realist , @entity108 says
suffering , truth and forgiveness contributed in helping heal racial wounds , he says
