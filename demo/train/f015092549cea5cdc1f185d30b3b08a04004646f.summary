@entity0 -- the 17 - year sentence given to convicted terrorist plotter @entity3 was ruled too lenient by a federal appeals court on monday , a legal victory for the @entity7 administration			1
a divided 2 - 1 panel of the 11th @entity9 said the federal judge presiding over the 2007 conspiracy trial did not properly take into account the former gang member 's past criminal history when sentencing him			1
@entity15 and two others were found guilty of conspiracy to murder @entity19 citizens and provide material support to terrorists			0
" @entity15 's sentence is substantively unreasonable because it ... does not adequately account for his risk of recidivism , was based partly on an impermissible comparison to sentences imposed in other terrorism cases , and was based in part on inappropriate factors , " said the majority			1
" first , the district court acknowledged that @entity15 had a criminal history but then unreasonably discounted this criminal history when it imposed a sentence			1
the presentence investigation report classified @entity15 as a career offender , pursuant to [ federal law ] because of his extensive criminal history , which included 17 arrests and a murder conviction			1
" @entity15 was originally arrested nearly a decade ago on accusations he planned to set off radioactive " dirty bombs " in the @entity19			1
he had been held for 3 Â½ years as an " enemy combatant " in military confinement , without being charged in that alleged plot			2
his later convictions were not related to those accusations , and prosecutors did not present the " dirty bomb " plot to the jury			2
he and co-defendants @entity56 and @entity58 were also found guilty of the three counts charged : conspiracy to murder , kidnap , and maim people in a foreign country ; conspiracy to provide material support for terrorists ; and providing material support for terrorists			0
the appeals panel upheld the convictions and sentences of the other two defendants but said @entity15 's prison term was too light , ordering the trial judge to resentence him			1
the judges supporting the tougher sentence were chief judge @entity77 -- a @entity79 appointee -- and @entity80 , a @entity81 appointee			2
the order did not include a deadline for resentencing			0
a federal court jury in @entity86 in august 2007 had deliberated for just under two days before handing down the guilty verdicts			1
@entity15 received a " fair trial and a just verdict , " the @entity88 said in a statement at the time , but the administration decided to appeal the sentence			1
the @entity7 administration picked up the case in 2009			0
there was no immediate reaction to the appeals ruling from either @entity15 's legal team or the @entity101			1
during the trial , prosecutors played more than 70 intercepted phone calls among the defendants for jurors , including seven that featured @entity15 , now 40			1
he is a @entity109 - born convert to @entity110 who also is referred to in court papers as @entity113			1
@entity115 agent @entity114 testified that the calls were made in code , which @entity15 used to discuss traveling overseas to fight with @entity110 militants , along with side trips to @entity121 and @entity122			0
@entity15 's lawyers had argued he never spoke in code			2
his voice is heard on only seven of 300,000 taped conversations			0
in dissent in monday 's ruling , judge @entity128 questioned @entity114 's testimony , saying his " opinion testimony should have been excluded because he was never qualified as an expert and did not have the requisite firsthand knowledge to offer his lay opinion			1
" she also said the appeals court should not have questioned the trial judge 's discretion over the sentence			1
the @entity141 in 2004 had heard @entity15 's original appeal over his former enemy - combatant status , claiming he deserved a chance to contest his prior military detention on constitutional grounds			1
he was arrested in may 2002 at @entity150 's @entity149 as he returned from overseas , where he had been living			2
he was detained as a material witness in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks investigation			0
president @entity81 designated him an " enemy combatant " the following month and turned him over to the military			0
he was one of the few terror suspects designated by the @entity19 as an enemy combatant since 9/11			2
@entity15 was held in a @entity160 naval brig for 3 1/2 years before the government brought criminal charges against him			1
in november 2006 , he was added to an existing indictment in south @entity164 , which said @entity15 and his co-defendants belonged to a @entity167 terrorist support cell and intended to carry out jihad , or holy war , in foreign countries			0
he was originally accused of , but never charged with , being a potential " dirty bomber , " allegedly plotting to detonate a crude explosive device laden with radioactive materials in the @entity19			0
those allegations were not included in the criminal indictment			0
two other enemy combatants eventually were sent overseas to the custody of other nations			0
the @entity7 administration has since abandoned using the term " enemy combatant			0
" the current @entity88 has been criticized for continuing many of the anti-terror policies of the @entity81 administration , including military prosecutions of high - value suspected terrorists held in @entity188			0
but some conservatives have also slammed president @entity7 for his previous desire to close the prison facility in @entity192 and prosecute terrorists in civilian federal courts in the @entity19			0
that policy has since been abandoned			0
" those three cases that include @entity15 , as well as other appeals from foreign nationals held as enemy combatants overseas at a @entity201 base at @entity188 , @entity192 , have tested the government 's power to interrogate captives without allowing them regular access to a lawyer or the judicial system , on the grounds that they may pose a future threat or know about pending terrorist attacks			2
the current ruling is @entity19 v. @entity15 ( 08 - 10494 ) .			2

17 years too little time for convicted terror plotter , federal appeals court rules
ruling : federal judge in 2007 trial did **n't** weigh criminal history adequately
dissenter : lower - court judge 's sentencing discretion should **n't** be question
@entity3 , 40 , a former gang member , plotted to set off " dirty bombs "
