the @entity12 is never awarded posthumously and that rule also eliminates @entity14 , the unemployed college graduate whose self - immolation in @entity16 sparked a popular uprising that led to the fall of @entity21 @entity20 's government			1
the @entity16 revolt began this year 's so - called @entity23			1

@entity16 blogger @entity134 is also on many top lists			0
censored in her own country , she criticized the regime long before the uprisings began , dispersing information to the outside world			0
" a prize to @entity134 would be a prize to independent reporting , in the form of social media , as well as recognition of the peaceful protests of the @entity16 people at large , " the peace institute website said			1
some experts think that @entity150 , an @entity51 scholar who founded the @entity151 in @entity152 , could be recognized for his work on the principles of non-violence , including " @entity156			2
