-- lost amidst the predictable clutter of the " will - he - or wo n't - she " questions about whether @entity4 or @entity5 will actually run for the presidency is an unexpected development : a hint of authenticity			1
turns out that political purgatory — even if temporary — can actually spark a genuine conversation with the public about what it takes to be president , and what goes into deciding whether you want to run			2
here 's @entity5 on herself : " the job is unforgiving in many ways , so i think you need people around you who will kid you , make fun of you			1
... you can lose touch with what 's real , what 's authentic			2
" here 's @entity4 on his decision : " can i do it where the sacrifice to my family is tolerable ? ... it 's a pretty ugly business right now			1
there 's a level under which i would never subjugate my family because that 's my organizing principle			2
" so while @entity39 wo n't answer questions about immigration and @entity42 is threatening to block presidential nominations and @entity44 is blaming the tragic @entity46 death on cigarette taxes , there 's another more personal and revealing conversation going on about the presidency and how to get there , and we ought to pay some attention			1
not just because it 's coming from @entity4 and @entity5 , although that is a part of it			1
after all , @entity5 's outside support network is up and running , even if she is n't officially yet			1
and while @entity4 has no campaign infrastructure or organization , his closest advisers are having enough meetings with enough operatives to send enough signals that it 's a very live , real , even likely , possibility			1
though @entity4 's advisers tell me he has n't made a decision , the process over the last six months sure looks like it leads to a presidential campaign			1
so all the cheerleaders need is the final hand signal			2
which brings us back to the @entity4 and @entity5 conversations			1
they 're thinking out loud , in a way , which hardly ever happens in politics anymore because it usually gets you into trouble			2
) but they 're both doing it because their decisions about running for the presidency come from places of deep family experience			1
@entity5 lived in the @entity88			1
@entity4 visited his brother and his father there			1
they get it -- at all levels			2
they understand the power and nature of the job			1
they also understand the " what - it - takes " component to run for it			0
and , in a way , they 've both got similar problems : they 're each practiced politicians , but they 're not the best transactional pols in their families			0
they each have problems with their party 's activist base			0
and they both can seem like old news			0
it 's that dynasty thing			0
maybe all that stuff actually prepares a candidate for the campaign , and maybe even for the job itself			1
@entity121 's ruminations about decision - making , for instance , are refreshing			0
" technology connects you around the world instantaneously , so you 're constantly being asked for opinions , to make decisions that maybe you need some time to think about , " she told a @entity125 audience on thursday			0
" maybe you need some time to sleep on it			0
maybe you need to bring in some people to talk about it			0
but the pace of demands is so intense that you feel like you 've got to respond			1
" it 's the stress , she said			0
" here 's what i worry about			0
the stress on anybody in a leadership position , multiplied many times over to be president			0
" it 's a much more honest assessment than talking about the tug of being a grandmother			1
as for @entity4 , in addition to the personal issues , he 's given a big hint he gets that he 's not aligned with the base of his party in some states — and that 's fine			1
in a recent appearance before a @entity160 ceo conference , he said the @entity162 nominee needs to be willing to " lose the primary to win the general ( election ) without violating your principles			0
" could he possibly be talking about @entity168 circa 2012 ? or his own problems with the party base on immigration and school reform ? my guess : both			2
i 'm also guessing this : what we are hearing from both of these politicians are part of the larger conversation they 're having with themselves			0
as in : do i need this ? can i do this ? is it worth it to me — and important enough to the country — for me to spend two years on this ? these are not wannabes			2
they 've been there , in the heat , in one way or another			0
so while the subordinates plan , organize and recruit , the actual deciders continue to decide			0
it 's getting down to the wire , and they know it			0
and it may be the most genuine stuff we hear for the next two years .			0

@entity209 : @entity4 , @entity5 talking authentically about demands of presidency
she says their comments show a keen *awareness* of the difficulty of the job
