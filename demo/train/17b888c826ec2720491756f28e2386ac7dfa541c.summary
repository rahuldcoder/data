its appearance on " @entity8 " on august 1 increased sales dramatically , with orders pouring in , according to @entity30 founder @entity37			1
" sales were weak for the first few years , " @entity37 said			1
" but after it was trashed on the show , sales have gone up			1
" " it happened overnight , " he said			0
" took me by surprise as a publisher			0
" the book was featured on the " @entity54 " portion of @entity9 's show , during which @entity9 commented on the book 's cover illustration , asking " if mom and dad are both safe because they 're packing , why are they using their daughter as a human shield ? " open carry has been a hot topic of conversation with several state legislatures debating its merits			1
@entity60 recently passed legislation that allows gun owners to openly bear firearms in public places , such as bars , schools and churches			1
@entity60 law allows guns in some schools , bars , churches on @entity32 , " @entity12 " has a total of 115 reviews			2
all but 11 of them are one - star or five - stars , and many of the reviews have been posted in days following the show			0

" the authors , @entity101 and @entity103 , are founders of the nonprofit group @entity104 when they started the group in 2009 , @entity101 said that it was n't widely known what open carry was , or that it was legal in the state			0
" our organization provided educational materials and seminars on the legality of open carry , " @entity101 said			0
" we answered many of the same questions over and over as well as debunked the myths surrounding the practice			0
" @entity101 decided that they should write a book answering the most common questions they got about open carry			0
