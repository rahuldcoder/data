-- social networking may be one of the biggest phenomenons of the 21st century , but for some denizens of the @entity5 , it 's a way to get in touch with the past			1
web sites like @entity9 ( with a membership of more than 5,700 ) and groups on @entity12 allow people who enjoy past eras to connect with each other			1
but it goes beyond that : some of them dress and live like they would decades , if not centuries , ago			2
step into @entity21 's living room in @entity22 , @entity23 , and you might feel like you 've traveled back to the 1890s			1
@entity21 , a hotel caterer , sees it as an escape from her stressful job			2
" i was the middle child and kind of like the dreamer , and for some strange reason i always dreamed of living not in @entity33 , but @entity34 , " she explained			1
" i imagined having tea with the queen and touring the castle and that was my dream as a little girl			2
" today , " @entity48 , " as she likes to be called , lives out that dream by hosting tea parties for her friends while dressed in @entity46 clothing , completely in character			2
when going out , she 's dressed in a more understated fashion , but still completely consistent with the late 1800s , with a long skirt and hat			2
" i always wear hats and when i go shopping , i get the attention of the older women , who say , i love the way you look , " she said			2
@entity59 : fashions of a modern - day @entity46 " eighteen - seventy - four should have been my birth date ... instead of 1974 , " said @entity61 of @entity62 , @entity63			1
her fascination with the @entity46 era began in childhood , coinciding with a pop cultural revival of @entity46 themes in the 1970s			2
@entity61 and her " @entity46 gentleman " began restoration on a circa - 1898 house in 2008			0
now they host 1800s - themed events there , where dress from the time period is always encouraged			1
they use @entity79 to organize these events as part of the @entity81			0
why would one live this lifestyle ? for many of these @entity85 , it 's a reaction to modern society just as much as a love of the fashion and style of days gone by			1
" i suppose others might call me an eccentric , but i just live the life i want to live and do n't care about what others say or think about me , " said @entity90 , a " living @entity46 , " from @entity91 , @entity34			1
" even though i 've felt increasingly disconnected from the modern world for many years now , i 'm not retreating into some past nether - world seeking a kind of comfort - blanket			1
" modern society in the @entity101 can be " remarkably cruel and unforgiving , " @entity90 said			1
" there is certainly no sense of any kind of community anymore , " he said			0
" people are purely self - centered , only in it for what they can get out of themselves			0
" he points to the recent mp expenses scandal there , which led to the resignation of @entity115 speaker @entity114 , as an example			0
at the same time , something just feels right to @entity118 when he wears a suit and bow tie , or more recently , an ascot			1
" it just creates a mind set that you 're ready to face the day , " he said			1
@entity90 is also the coordinator of the @entity125 , who take walks around the city while decked out in @entity46 garb , and says that the reaction from passersby , especially tourists , is extremely positive			1
" it 's quite extraordinary , people just love it			0
" social networking certainly plays a large role , but @entity90 also believes that groups like the @entity125 ( with its 125 members on @entity12 ) are emerging more and more lately			1
" i think it 's just a lot of people saying ' i do n't like what i see anymore , so let 's create our own reality			0
' " @entity146 of @entity147 , @entity148 , certainly sees that as being the case			0
she runs one of several social networking sites that bring together retro lifestyle enthusiasts of all stripes			1
" the first thing i ask [ members of the web site ] is what they would like to bring from the past			1
many of them say they would like to see the return of good manners and morals , " she said			0
" they like the values of respect for women , respect for others			0
now with the society we live in , anything goes			0
" @entity146 , like @entity90 , can trace at least some of what influences her to @entity172			0
growing up in the 1970s and ' 80s , she was a big fan of " @entity176 , " @entity173 and " @entity174 , " but " @entity175 " captured her imagination			0
" just thinking about traveling in time to whatever year that i always dreamed about was fascinating to me ! " she said			2
needless to say , the 1950s are her favorite era			0
this translated into her pursuit of art , which she described as both modern and retro			2
when her love of this time translated into reality upon viewing a documentary about " time warp wives , " she was inspired to start the blog @entity191 , eager for the opportunity to interview women who live their lives as " traditional 1950s housewives			1
" @entity59 : @entity146 's life as a " retro artist " now , those with casual interest as well as those who live their lives in a past era , what @entity146 calls " timewarpians , " interact on her site , @entity205 , which boasts more than 250 members			1
" when people come to this site , they see that they 're not alone , " she said			0
@entity146 considers " @entity210 to be a great example of a " timewarpian			0
" @entity21 hopes to pass on the manners , if not necessarily the fashion , of the era to the next generation by hosting parties with young girls and teaching them about etiquette			0
as for her own granddaughters , she said they love paying a visit			0
" they ask their mother if they can wear a pretty dress and go to grandmother 's house			0
