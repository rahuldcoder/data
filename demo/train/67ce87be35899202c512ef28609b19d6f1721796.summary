-- @entity2 media expressed concern tuesday about the prospects of @entity5 getting a fair trial following his arrest in @entity8 over the death of a 21 - year - old woman			1
@entity8 authorities say that @entity5 has already confessed to killing @entity12 and could be charged on tuesday			1
if convicted of murder he could face up to 35 years in jail			0
the case has attracted international attention because van der sloot was twice arrested and released in connection with the disappearance of @entity22 teenager @entity20 in @entity23 in 2005			1
in a comment piece published on tuesday morning before the alleged confession , @entity2 newspaper @entity24 warned that police and authorities in @entity8 were under " overwhelming pressure " from the media to condemn van der @entity5 , as soon as possible , warning that his presumed guilt appeared to be a " foregone conclusion " which risked turning his case into a " show trial			1
" it also criticized the " openness " of the @entity8 police in placing van der @entity39 in front of television cameras wearing a bulletproof vest , warning that it could compromise the case against the suspect			1
" showing the suspect as a trophy could seriously harm the investigation			0
it could influence witnesses before they are heard , " said @entity24			2
@entity24 also criticized @entity2 forensic psychology professor @entity52 who speculated in another @entity2 newspaper , @entity54 , that van der @entity5 displayed " all the major features of a classic psychopath			1
" @entity57 has not met van der @entity5 and told @entity54 her suggestion that he may have a psychopathic disorder was based on analysis of " books , images and interviews " concerning the case			1
she cited an interview he gave on @entity2 television in 2008 following which he threw a glass of wine into the face of crime reporter @entity70			2
psychopathic personality disorder is a chronic mental illness also known as antisocial personality disorder			0
those with the condition " typically have no regard for right and wrong " and may be prone to violent behavior , according to @entity79			0
@entity57 told the newspaper that typical psychopathic characteristics included a lack of empathy and guilt , manipulative tendencies , pathological lying and narcissism			2
" psychopaths have a certain flair			0
they have wit , and they can also be very charming and polite , " @entity90 said			0
but @entity24 , in the opinion piece published before van der @entity5 's alleged confession , said : " what if he is still proven innocent ? on closer inspection , the 22 - year - old @entity2 is just a suspect in an ' ordinary ' murder investigation			1
so he must be treated			0
until the court has sentenced , after thorough deliberation			0
" that sentiment was echoed by the web site of the @entity105 language @entity106 which voiced concerns about the amount of possible evidence which had already been made public			0
it noted that @entity5 was " already a well - known figure in the @entity22 , the @entity2 and in @entity23			2
" " generally , the @entity2 never interferes with legal processes in other countries , but there may well be reason to protest in this case , " it said			1
@entity106 said van der @entity5 's alleged confession over the killing of @entity12 was a " surprise " as van der @entity39 had previosly refused to say anything about his alleged involvement			1
" for @entity8 , @entity5 is principally a matter of prestige , " the web site said			2
" his rights and privacy are secondary to the country 's desire to show off to the world with its handling of the @entity12 murder case			0
" @entity134 in @entity135 contributed to this story .			0

@entity2 paper @entity24 says van der @entity5 case risks becoming a " show trial "
@entity142 says @entity8 authorities ' " openness " could compromise trial
@entity54 says van der @entity5 displays " psychopathic " tendencies
@entity106 says there could be reason to protest over the case
