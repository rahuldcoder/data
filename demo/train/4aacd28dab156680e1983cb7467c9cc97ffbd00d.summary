yellow balloons and @entity11 flags line the sidewalks of @entity0 , population 8,000			1
residents planted one tree for each of the five years @entity8 was held captive in @entity17			1

@entity11 officials said the government of @entity81 brokered the deal			1
some fellow soldiers : bergdahl a deserter " we were very concerned that time was not ... something we could play with -- that we needed to act when we had the opportunity , " @entity85 said			2
@entity8 's condition on monday was stable , and he was " receiving treatment for conditions that require hospitalization , " a @entity11 defense official told @entity2			1
people at @entity67 were trying to build @entity8 's trust in them , as he has n't been able to trust anyone around him for five years , the official said			1
a senior defense official said @entity8 was having trouble speaking @entity100 , but the reasons for that were not clear , given the trauma he 's been through			1
doctors in @entity65 are evaluating his health and whether he 's ready to be transported , said @entity106 , a spokeswoman for @entity107			1
once doctors give the ok , a receiving team will travel to @entity65 to facilitate his transport to @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112			1
the recovery team has been training for the trip for years , practicing @entity8 's return trip 10 times with drills eventually involving hundreds of personnel , including stand - ins for the soldier and his family , she said			1
from @entity110 , @entity8 will head to the @entity123 , where a room is ready for him and a support team is standing by , @entity106 said			1

once in the @entity11 , she said , @entity8 's daily routine will focus on four key areas : medical care , psychological support , debriefings and family support			1
" this is to help a person who has had no control of their own life for years now regain that control step by step , " she said			2
there 's no set time limit for how long the reintegration process will take , she said , because the case for each returnee is different			0
@entity8 was believed to be held by operatives from the @entity164 , which is affiliated with the @entity26 and @entity165			1
an @entity17 @entity26 commander not authorized to speak to the media confirmed to @entity2 that @entity8 was captured by insurgents with links to the @entity164 in @entity78			1
over the years , the captive was transferred back and forth between @entity17 and @entity78 , the @entity26 commander said			1
@entity171 , a former @entity172 journalist who was held captive by the @entity26 for seven months , said @entity8 faces a long road ahead			1
" psychologically , there will be a long debrief , " said @entity171 , who was taken in @entity17 and held in @entity78 until he managed to escape			1
" they 're actually going to want intelligence ( about ) who held him			0
" but there 's a chance @entity8 might not know much about @entity26 commanders			2
" i was kept with very young guards , most of the time , and i did n't really meet very senior commanders that often , " @entity171 said			0
@entity22 human resources officials will determine where @entity8 goes after he completes the reintegration process in @entity111 , @entity106 said			2
he 'll receive follow up care and have access to a psychiatrist for the rest of his life			0
@entity8 , who 's still on active duty in the @entity22 , could return to his unit in @entity194 or be reassigned , she said			2
facing criticism one question that remains unanswered is how @entity8 disappeared in the first place			2
several veterans and soldiers call him a deserter who walked off his base on june 30 , 2009			0
at least six soldiers were killed in subsequent searches for him			0
" @entity8 deserted during a time of war and his fellow @entity11 lost their lives searching for him , " said former sgt. @entity205 , a member of @entity8 's platoon			1
@entity205 said @entity8 needs to not only acknowledge his actions publicly but face a military trial for desertion under the @entity214			2

" a senior defense official said @entity8 will not likely face any punishment			1
" five years is enough , " he told @entity2 on condition of anonymity			2
@entity126 said questions about the circumstances of @entity8 's disappearance did n't play into efforts to retrieve him			2
" here 's what matters			0
he was a prisoner in an armed conflict , a member of the military , and in that situation the @entity11 does not leave its men and women behind , " @entity126 told @entity2			1
what 's next for the administration defending the swap some lawmakers are openly wondering whether @entity8 's release sets a dangerous precedent for future kidnappings of @entity11			1
" the methodology in what we used is very troublesome , " said rep. @entity250 , chairman of the @entity11 @entity251			2
" we have a changing footprint in @entity17 , which would put our soldiers at risk for this notion that if i can get one , i can get five @entity26 released			1
" @entity85 defended the @entity56 administration 's efforts			0
" if we got into a situation where we said , ' because of who has captured an @entity11 soldier on the battlefield , we will leave that person behind , ' we would be in a whole new era for the safety of our personnel and for the nature of our commitment to our men and women in uniform , " she said on @entity2 's " @entity71			1
" " because it was the @entity26 that had him did not mean that we had any less of an obligation to bring him back			0
" briefing lawmakers some members of @entity281 are trying to understand why they did n't know what was happening			0
rep. @entity283 , chairman of the @entity284 , said he still has n't been briefed by administration officials on the detainee swap			0
the @entity288 @entity287 said he plans to hold hearings about the @entity8 exchange , he told @entity2 chief congressional correspondent @entity291 on sunday			2
" we 're getting our information -- other than a very brief notification -- we 're getting most of our information now from the media , " he said in an exclusive interview on " newsroom			0
" @entity283 said the @entity299 notified his staff on saturday , after the exchange took place			0
but he pointed to a law that requires the administration to notify @entity281 30 days before detainees are released from the facilities at @entity27			2

" we had participated in a number of briefings some time ago , and there ( were ) considerable concerns , " the @entity288 @entity314 said			0
rep. @entity250 , chairman the @entity251 , said he planned to look into whether @entity56 broke the law by not notifying @entity281 30 days in advance			0
" i think it certainly merits further review , and that 's what i 'm going to do to make that determination , " the @entity323 @entity287 told @entity2 's @entity324			0
" it certainly does n't smell right to me			0
" @entity328 , @entity56 's deputy national security adviser , told @entity2 monday that administration officials did n't notify @entity281 in advance because they faced an " urgent situation " with deep concerns about @entity8 's health			1
" we had information that it was deteriorating			0
we had an opportunity that was very fast - moving to close this deal , to bring him back			2
and based on the law , we had the flexibility to do that			0
... we had an urgent matter , and we had an opportunity , and we seized it , " he said			1
after consulting with the @entity344 to make sure the move was legal , he said , the administration decided to go ahead with the prisoner swap to avoid the risk of the @entity26 changing its mind or the information leaking out			0
" in the days ahead , there will be full briefings of the relevant committees in @entity281 , and indeed , of every member who wants it , " @entity328 said			0
