-- there is no easy cure for teenage traffic deaths and injuries , but @entity5 believes she has at least come up with a way to help limit the carnage : when a new driver gets behind the wheel , just slap a temporary warning sign on the car			1
the @entity13 and @entity14 volunteers hand out the magnets during 2008 publicity campaign			1
@entity5 has developed signs for teens with learner permits and first - year licenses			1
they are attached magnetically to the car 's sheet metal and display the words " @entity25			1
" it 's not hard to imagine the signs being a nightmare to teens obsessed with what their peers think			1
but , @entity5 , a @entity32 , @entity33 , mother of six , says the real horror is out on the highway : thousands of young people are killed and injured in traffics every year			1
more than 15,000 of people have ordered the signs since @entity5 and a group of other moms introduced them four years ago			1
parents can mount one on the trunk when a teenager takes off in the family car and remove it when he or she returns home			2
once other drivers see it , they presumably exercise extra caution and create a " protective bubble " around the new driver , or so the thinking runs			1
@entity54 autos : rules for safe driving @entity5 would even like to see states require the use of the signs for new drivers , as some @entity62 countries do , and she has found some support for this in the @entity33 legislature			1
her goal is straightforward : limit teenagers ' capacity to do damage to themselves and others			2
drivers 16 to 19 years old are four times as likely as older drivers to end up in a collision , all other things being equal , according to the @entity77 ( @entity77 )			1
all @entity79 states have adopted tougher licensing systems since the mid- 1990s , generally requiring more supervised hours of driving and imposing more restrictions on new licensees			1
but they have all stopped short of setting the minimum driving age at 18 , as most @entity62 countries do			1
the latest research has confirmed that putting restrictions on young drivers does pay off in lower accident , injury and fatality rates			1
one @entity77 study over 10 years found that states with strong licensing laws had 30 percent fewer fatalities among 15 to 17 year olds than states with weak laws ( those lacking restrictions on cell phone use , for example , or having only minimal restrictions on nighttime driving during the first year of driving )			1
@entity54 autos : most common car related injuries armed with a decade of data , activists like @entity5 now see a chance to save more lives with further reform			2
" my first fear for each of my sons is , ' please do n't let anybody hit them , ' " she said			2
" my second fear is that they might hit anyone else			0
" " do you have any idea what it is like to be the parent of a 16 - year - old who has killed someone ? " she asked			0
" parents have called me and said it 's like living in a black hole			0
" her campaign started four years ago when she started to worry about her son @entity131 , even though his turn at driver training was still a few years down the road			0
the fact that nearby @entity136 ranked as one of the most congested cities in the country naturally fed her fears			0
she and a group of friends began to think about ways to give young drivers an edge			1
they did n't want to force teenagers to wait until they were 21 to drive			0
but they did want to help them stay safe while they were learning			0
@entity54 autos : teen driving tips the moms came up the idea for magnetic signs , only later discovering that a similar approach is a requirement for new drivers in parts of @entity62 , @entity5 said			1
once , when she proposed the idea to a @entity33 state official , he asked her if there was anyone who did n't like it			0
she laughed and said , " yes , my son			0
but we can work on him			0
" but she is happy the other people can readily identify new drivers and give them plenty of room			1
" and whenever you are being watched , your behavior tends to be a little better			0
" since they can easily spot teenagers right out of driver 's education , police can enforce restrictions on the number of passengers allowed in their cars , she said			1
many states restrict the number of occupants for six months or a year in the second phase of their graduated license programs			2
" when you are learning how to drive , you need all your concentration and you ca n't be cool for all your friends , " @entity5 said			0
skeptics argue that teenage drivers will pull the signs off as soon as they are out of their parents ' sight			1
but @entity5 has an answer for the skeptics : if parents ever found out a son or daughter did that , it should be the last time they ever drove the family car			0
one early success for the " newly licensed " signs was a pilot program in @entity208 , @entity33 , in 2007 ; @entity5 and her friends distributed more than 3,000 magnets			1
she now sells them nationally at cost , for $ 7.99 , through a web site , @entity214 , and is looking for a national retail outlet to handle them			0
she has also been a guest on television programs to promote the magnets			2
@entity5 also advocates longer periods of supervised driving for new drivers , contending they should be at least 400 hours			2
accidents only start to decline after drivers get that amount of driving experience under their belts , she said			2
@entity54 autos : teen drivers need better training many experts agree the quickest way to save lives would be to raise the driving age from 16 to 17 or higher			1
" but it 's a tough sell , " said @entity234 , a spokesman for @entity235 , @entity236 - based @entity77			0
the states could withhold a provisional license until 17			0
but so far , only @entity240 does that , offering new drivers a full license at 18			2
" but @entity240 has had a very positive experience with it , " @entity234 said			0
there are other options , too			0
more states could impose tougher restrictions : less nighttime driving , a ban on cell phones ( if they have n't already prohibited them ) , and fewer passengers allowed in the car			1
right now , states are all over the map on these issues			0
for example , @entity259 has a cell phone restriction for the first year , while @entity262 and @entity263 do not			0
@entity262 only allows one passenger unrelated to the driver the first six months of the provisional period but allows three for the second			0
during the entire probationary year , @entity240 allows only one person who is n't part of the driver 's household in the car			0
@entity54 autos : risky teen driving habits @entity275 enforces a fairly tough nighttime restriction , 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. , while @entity277 prohibits driving between 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. the rule is more lenient in @entity279 : driving is permitted anytime except midnight to 5 a.m. other countries are n't squeamish about placing nationalized limitations on young drivers			1
for example , the @entity284 requires drivers to be at least 17			2
the age is 18 in most other @entity62 countries			2
a movement is underway in @entity290 to more than quadruple the period of supervised driving to 120 hours			0
new @entity294 drivers have to post a warning sign on the vehicles they drive , as do young drivers in @entity298			1
some countries requiring the warnings have even put teeth into their signage laws : drivers who collide with a car displaying the new - driver signs face heavy fines or even jail time , @entity5 said			1
that 's an indication that the signs are important tools to reduce accidents			2
" we are n't going to save every kid , " @entity5 said			0
" we are rational about this			0
but if we save at least some of them , it 's worth it			0

research finds putting restrictions on young drivers lowers accident rates
some countries require new drivers to post warning signs on their cars
mother of teen *invents* magnets for cars that warn , @entity25
identifying teens lets police enforce restrictions such as number of passengers
