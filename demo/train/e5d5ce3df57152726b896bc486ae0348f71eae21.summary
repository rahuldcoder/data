-- @entity1 has sent shockwaves throughout the tennis world after withdrawing from the @entity4			1
the 11 - times grand slam champion , who reached the final in @entity8 last year , had been expected to make his comeback from injury next month			1
@entity1 's withdrawal means he will slip out of the top four for the first time in over seven years			1
after pulling out of an exhibition tournament in @entity14 this week with a stomach infection , @entity1 was still expected to compete at the @entity17 event in @entity18 before making his way to @entity20			1
the 26 - year - old , who has not played since his shock second round defeat by world number 100 @entity25 at @entity26 , had hoped to make a return to action following a six - month absence with a knee injury			1
@entity1 suffers comeback blow but a virus has forced @entity1 to pull out of both @entity18 and the @entity4 following discussions with doctors			1
he said : " my knee is much better and the rehabilitation process has gone well as predicted by the doctors , but this virus did n't allow me to practice this past week and therefore i am sorry to announce that i will not play in @entity18 and the @entity4 , as we had initially scheduled			1
" as my team and doctors say , the safest thing to do is to do things well and this virus has delayed my plans of playing these weeks			0
" i will have to wait until the @entity47 tournament to compete again , although i could consider to play before at any other @entity17 event			0
" i always said that my return to competition will be when i am in the right conditions to play and after all this time away from the courts i 'd rather not accelerate the comeback and prefer to do things well			2
" @entity1 has endured an injury - ravaged year , missing out on defending his @entity56 title at @entity57 as well as sitting out the @entity59 and @entity61 's @entity60 final defeat in november			1
coach and uncle @entity62 believes his nephew was left with little choice but to cancel his plans to compete in @entity8 after contracting the virus			2
@entity1 to make long - awaited tennis return he said : " we consider not appropriate to play the @entity4 since we will not have enough preparation for a greater competition which is a @entity73 tournament			1
" it is simply not conceivable that his first event is a best of five sets event , he would n't be ready for that			0
" it is true we have been quite unlucky with this but there is nothing we can do			0
" after all this time it is better to do things well and the most professional thing to do is to start when we are ready			0
" while the @entity1 camp is understandably saddened by the news , it will also leave his fellow professionals disappointed			2
world number one , @entity91 , who beat @entity1 in @entity8 last year , was looking forward to facing his old adversary once again			1
" i was eager to see him play , " said @entity91			2
" he has been off the tour for the past seven months and i am sure that all tennis fans and all sports fans want to see him back on the court , healthy and fit			0
" i wish him , as a colleague , a fast recovery			0
" it 's unfortunate and i 'm sure he feels the biggest need to play tennis out of everybody and hopefully he can bit for the @entity4 which is the most important experience			2
" @entity91 wins @entity109 title meanwhile , @entity91 started his own season in style with a 6 - 0 6 - 3 win over @entity113			1
the @entity115 star , who won the tournament last year , cruised through the first set before @entity113 began to offer resistance in the second			2
@entity113 , ranked five in the world , led 3 - 1 in the second before @entity91 roared back to take the set			1
" i love this court and the conditions here			0
i wish all the tournaments in the world were played here , " @entity91 told @entity124			0
" it 's definitely a great surface			0
it 's not too warm here , not too cold , it 's ideal to prepare on			0
" i am surprised with my game considering it 's the first match of the official season			0
hopefully i can play another good one tomorrow			0
" @entity91 will meet @entity134 in the final after the @entity136 came from a set down to defeat @entity137 2 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 2 .			2
