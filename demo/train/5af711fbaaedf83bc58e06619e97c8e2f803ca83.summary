@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 told investigators during an interrogation that he knows the location of @entity9 's body , but he would neither identify the location nor say what happened to her the night of her disappearance , a @entity1 police official told @entity2 thursday in @entity0			1
" he says he knew the location of the @entity19 citizen but that he was going to explain everything to @entity22 police , " said @entity14 , head of the homicide division of the @entity1 national police investigative unit			1
@entity4 , twice detained but never charged in the disappearance of @entity24 five years ago in @entity22 , was arrested last week in connection with a different case : the slaying of a 21 - year - old @entity1 woman in @entity0 , the nation 's capital			1
he confessed to the @entity1 woman 's slaying earlier this week , police said			1

the lawyer said he has spoken with the director of jails in @entity0 to make sure van der @entity4 is safe once he is moved to one of the city 's maximum - security prisons			1
@entity47 said he planned to ask the judge in the case to strike down van der @entity4 's confession in the @entity1 case , because he was not properly represented when he was interrogated			1
the attorney said police got a public defense attorney to be present at the interrogation and subsequent confession , but that van der @entity4 never agreed to this lawyer			1
@entity47 also said he has found indications that the handling of the evidence was tainted , especially the way the body was handled during the crime scene investigation			2
he intends to go to trial , @entity47 said			0
the body of @entity68 was found last week in a hotel room registered to @entity4			1
hotel surveillance video shows the pair entering his room and van der @entity4 leaving alone more than three hours later			1
@entity47 said @entity68 attacked van der @entity75 first , after he confronted her for going through his computer			0
police said @entity68 was badly beaten and suffered a broken neck			0
@entity4 confessed monday night after a seven - hour interrogation to killing @entity68 , a source with direct knowledge of the investigation told @entity2			1
the @entity85 citizen told investigators that he left the hotel room to buy bread and coffee at a gas station next to the hotel , the source said			0
upon @entity4 's return , he found @entity68 going through his laptop , where she found something linking him to @entity24 's disappearance , the source said			1
at that point , @entity68 wanted to leave , and the pair started arguing , according to the source			0
@entity68 slapped van der @entity75 , and he hit her back , and then grabbed her neck , the source said			0
@entity4 told investigators he had smoked marijuana before the confrontation , the source said			1
although @entity68 ' body was found half - dressed , there was no evidence that she had sexual intercourse that night , the source said			2
@entity4 , 22 , was arrested in @entity112 on june 4 and returned to @entity1 the next day			1
while he was never charged in connection with @entity24 's disappearance in 2005 , he has been charged in @entity115 with extortion and wire fraud charges			0
according to a document from @entity120 , van der @entity4 contacted a representative of @entity24 's mother , @entity24 , on or around march 29 to ask for $ 250,000 in exchange for information on the whereabouts of @entity9 's remains			2
@entity4 received $ 25,000 last month , officials said			2
a representative for @entity24 's mother who paid the money was an undercover @entity131 agent , a federal law enforcement official told @entity2			0
however , the @entity131 and the @entity19 attorney 's office in @entity134 , @entity115 , said wednesday that the @entity131 did not supply the money			0
" some news accounts have suggested that the @entity131 provided $ 25,000 in funds that were transmitted to @entity4			2
the funds involved were private funds , " the @entity131 and @entity19 attorney 's office said in a statement			0
the @entity131 and @entity19 attorney 's office in @entity134 arranged for a meeting in which van der @entity4 was paid $ 10,000 in cash and another $ 15,000 in a wire transfer , a source familiar with the case said			1
the meeting took place in may , according to the @entity19 attorney 's office in @entity134			0
@entity120 documents show that the $ 15,000 was transferred to a personal bank account in the @entity85			0
the information about @entity9 that @entity4 provided to the @entity131 was not true , according to the documents			2
although the investigation involving alleged extortion had been in motion for several weeks at the time of @entity68 ' death , " it was not sufficiently developed to bring charges prior to the time van der @entity4 left @entity22 , " the @entity131 statement said			2
" this is not due to any fault on the part of the @entity131 or the @entity19 attorney 's office , where agents and prosecutors were working as hard as possible to bring the case to fruition when they learned of the murder			0
a case based on events outside of the @entity19 is a complex matter , and work was proceeding with all deliberate speed to prepare the evidence , the charges and the necessary procedures to obtain custody of van der @entity75 , " the statement said			0
@entity2 's @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
