-- it takes a real man to make the moves on the wife of the most powerful man in the biggest country in the world			1
especially when the wife is a civilian major general , her husband is sitting next to her , at the @entity11 in @entity12 , hobnobbing with the @entity13 and the entire event is being televised			1
but if 2014 has taught us anything it is that @entity18 is a real man			1
from grabbing @entity19 to finagling a featured role in the @entity22 opening ceremonies for his gymnast girlfriend , he has flexed his political muscles as often as his pecs , and according to @entity28 newspaper has become " a heart - throb among many @entity31 women for his macho , man - of - action image			1
" and the social media - obsessed hordes on the @entity37 loved it			2
they loved him draping a shawl over the chilly shoulders of @entity43 on monday			2
they loved her taking it			0
they loved that @entity31 's censors later concluded it did n't show their leader , president @entity49 , in a good light as a husband ( too inattentive ) and decided to block the footage within @entity31			1
never mind @entity54 , @entity55 , a historic greenhouse gas deal reached between @entity31 and the @entity57 , or anything else about the actual meeting of world leaders that @entity18 , @entity49 and president @entity61 were attending			1
this small act of courtesy by the scourge of @entity19 showed him as adept at grabbing headlines as he is neighboring territories			0
what does @entity18 know that others , like @entity61 , for whom the @entity31 meeting is more of a respite from the news than a high - profile visit , do not ? perhaps it is that the viewing public is essentially an adolescent boy			1
or more properly , the audiences of the world are -- despite cultural and demographic differences -- pretty much just like the idiots that sat in the back of your eighth - grade history class snoozing through the substance but tittering through anything off - color and titillated by explosion , fights and mayhem			0
it used to be said that your better newspapers were written to be readable at an eighth - grade reading level			0
nowadays in the world of immersive social media , 140 - character tweets and never - ending video from smartphones and live feeds worldwide , what does reading have to do with it			2
the audience giggles and laughs for the same reason they did in miss @entity108 's class			0
because everyone else was doing it			0
how else do you explain that television producers and web pundits thought that one subject worthy of debate was a video showing @entity61 chewing gum at the same @entity11 meeting in @entity12			1
the president appeared undignified to some @entity31 observers with a taste for the trivial			2
said one @entity31 social media commentator , " we made this meeting so luxurious , with singing and dancing , but see @entity61 , stepping out of his car chewing gum like an idler			1
" needless to say , some of @entity57 's more right - wing news organizations picked up on the story because it showed @entity61 in a bad light -- as if plunging popularity ratings and a drubbing in the polls were not enough			2
the teacher 's socks do n't match , @entity143 has last year 's backpack			0
that 's way more important than , like , geopolitics			0
this is not entirely new			0
when @entity149 threw up on the prime minister of japan on a trip awhile back or when @entity152 stumbled down a flight of stairs even longer ago , the gaffes became memes , defining these two notable public servants more so than many of their biggest accomplishments			0
but in recent years , the frequency and ridiculousness of the incidents seem to have accelerated			1
whether it is @entity165 massaging @entity168 chancellor @entity167 's shoulders at a summit , or @entity61 grabbing a selfie with @entity172 's attractive prime minister at a memorial service for @entity174 , to the apparent displeasure of @entity176 , world leader outtakes have become pure click bait			1
which is why tonight when you turn on the news , some of it is likely to look a lot like " the @entity185 's @entity184			0
" but as you gawk and click and click again , remember it 's not the media that are at fault			2
you 're the one who chose to sit in the back of the class with the other nitwits .			0

@entity196 : it takes a real man , @entity18 , to " make moves " on @entity31 leader 's wife at @entity11
@entity18 *put* shawl on her , and media went nuts because public is an adolescent boy , he says
forget *climate* deal , @entity55 , @entity54 , he says , when focus is on @entity61 chewing gum
@entity196 : these *nonevents* have *increased* in recent years , and we 're to blame
