editor 's note : a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 is the author of the forthcoming book , " @entity5 : president @entity7 to the @entity8 as originally reported by @entity2 " and of two other books , " listening to the @entity6 " and " speak , @entity10 ! a @entity12 's view of @entity13			1

@entity2 says conservative critics are wrong to chortle at the defeat of the @entity19 bid			1
( @entity20 ) -- whenever president @entity22 has traveled overseas and offered pointed and direct assessments of the @entity13 , some of them critical , republicans have ripped him for criticizing @entity13 , saying a president should always defend the @entity13			1
so i want to hear the explanation by these so - called patriots of their giddy behavior over the @entity13 losing the 2016 @entity32			1
the bid that was rejected friday by the @entity34 was not a @entity37 , @entity36 , bid			1
it was the official bid submitted by the @entity39 and was representative of the nation			2
@entity43 's bid was that of @entity44 ; @entity45 's was that of @entity46 ; and @entity47 's was that of @entity48			2
@entity21 want to spin the decision as a massive loss by president @entity22 and the @entity51 who have always controlled @entity37 politics			1
" hahahahaha , " wrote @entity53 on the conservative " @entity55 " blog , " i thought the world would love us more now that @entity58 was gone			2
" what the critics do n't see is that @entity22 's loss on the @entity32 is @entity13 's loss			1
any red - blooded @entity63 who loves to see the @entity63 flag raised and the national anthem played when one of our own wins a gold medal should blast the @entity21 ' giddiness over the loss			0
i can recall crying along with millions of @entity13 when our hockey team beat the @entity75 and won the hockey gold in 1980			1
where were those games ? @entity79 , @entity80			0
@entity81 spread all across the nation , not only because we beat the mighty @entity75 , but also because it took place on @entity63 soil			0
when @entity87 and @entity88 dominated the 1984 @entity32 , we all beamed with pride because they represented the @entity13 on @entity63 soil in @entity91 , @entity92			1
and when @entity93 stormed around the track to obliterate the world record in the 200 - meter dash ( since broken by @entity98 's @entity97 ) , we relished the win as he took a victory lap around the stadium in @entity102 , @entity103			0
@entity13 love home field advantage , and we always desire to show the rest of the world what we are made of			1
i do n't care if @entity21 want to rip president @entity22 over going to @entity109 , @entity110 , to pitch for the games			0
this is n't about politics			0
it 's not about ideology			0
our loss of the games			0
so , to all the critics happy about us losing the 2016 games , turn in your flag lapel pins and stop boasting of being so patriotic			0
when an @entity63 city loses , like @entity80 did in the the last go - round , we all lose			0
and all you critics are on the same level as the @entity13 haters all across the world			1
you should be shouted down for not backing your own country			0
the next time any of you bang out a press release about " @entity63 " or " support our troops , " remember this moment when your cynical , callous and small - minded brains happily rejoiced when @entity13 lost the 2016 @entity32			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : the @entity37 bid was made on behalf of the whole country
he says conservatives boast of being patriots but are *applauding* a @entity13 defeat
he says @entity13 love to cheer on their @entity19 *athletes* on home soil
