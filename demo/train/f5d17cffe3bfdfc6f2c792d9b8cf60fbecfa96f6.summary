" in conclusion , reading the second @entity24 constitution i ca n't trust the current government because of the ratifications : the government is implying mind control and brainwash on the people by controlling grammar , " he wrote in one piece posted to @entity20			2
" no ! i wo n't pay debt with a currency that 's not backed by gold and silver ! no ! i wo n't trust in @entity145 ! " @entity146 , director of the @entity147 at @entity148 , said the postings show " classic signs of psychosis			1

those were signs , classic signs you 'd see in a psychiatric unit of formal thought disorder			1
" and forensic psychologist @entity161 called the postings " absolutely psychotic			0
" @entity4 should have been evaluated for schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , autism or other mental illnesses , she said			1
" i understand the thing about the grammar , " @entity161 said			0
" there is a group , or a person , that talks about how the grammar is used to control the population , and so i hear that he 's picking up that from someone else , too			2
so he 's been influenced by other people			0
" @entity4 dropped out of high school in 2006 , after being taken to a hospital for alcohol poisoning near the end of his junior year , according to @entity47 records released wednesday			1
in 2007 , he was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia , but the charge was dismissed after he completed a pretrial diversion program , according to court records			0
when he tried to enlist in the @entity187 in 2008 , the service rejected him for reasons it says it ca n't disclose due to privacy laws			0

" police were unable to contact him at the number he left for them , and the matter went no further , according to a sheriff 's report			2
after dropping out of school , @entity4 enrolled at @entity211 , a partnership between @entity0 schools and @entity209 that helps high school dropouts transition to community colleges , @entity209 president @entity208 told @entity2			2
he took classes at the college until october 2010 , when withdrew after five contacts with police and a suspension			2
@entity222 instructor @entity221 said he had @entity4 removed from his class in june after multiple disruptions in the first three weeks of the course			2

" " he would sit at his desk with that grin that you see in the mug shot that i 've seen on the news , " @entity230 said			1

" @entity209 told @entity4 that he needed a letter from a mental health professional certifying that he posed no danger to himself or others before he would be allowed to return			2
yet nothing in his record turned up in the background check carried out in november , when he bought the weapon police say was used in the killings			2
@entity45 said the investigation into saturday 's killings focuses less on who was responsible than why			2
but he cautioned , " you ca n't really make reason out of something that is unreasonable			0
" " perhaps some psychologist or psychiatrist may opine at some point why they think this happened , " he said			0
" we can present the evidence , give it to experts , and somebody else might come up with why			0
but law enforcement at this point does n't have it			0
