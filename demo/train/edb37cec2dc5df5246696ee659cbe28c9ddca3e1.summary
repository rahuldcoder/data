lawyers for presidential assailant @entity1 say he is not dangerous and should eventually be released from a government mental hospital			1
but prosecutors are fighting that , saying @entity1 has been deceptive about his activities while on visits to his mother in @entity8 , @entity9			1
a hearing began in @entity11 on wednesday to determine the future of @entity1 , who shot president @entity13 and three others in march of 1981			1
he was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 1982			1
in opening statements , prosecutor @entity18 said @entity21 agents will testify they performed surveillance on @entity1 without his knowledge earlier this year when he was allowed what he was told was unsupervised free time in @entity8			1
on several occasions in july and september , @entity1 was supposed to go to the movies or shopping but instead went to bookstores where he looked at books about @entity13 and presidential assassins , @entity26 said			1
a requirement of @entity35 's current visitation program is that plans be laid out detailing what he will do when on his own and that medical staff and the @entity21 are informed			0
according to @entity26 , in the first instance in july , @entity1 was supposed to go to the movie " @entity41			1
" later when he saw his " treatment team , " @entity1 not only maintained he had gone to the movie , but he enthusiastically recommended it			1
@entity26 also quoted from a 1987 diary entry by @entity1 in which he said " psychiatry is a guessing game " and doctors " will never know the true @entity1			1
" " the hospital does n't know what mr. @entity1 is thinking and he wants it that way , " the prosecutor said			1
@entity1 's attorney , @entity52 , said the issue is not whether @entity1 has sometimes been deceptive but whether he is dangerous			1
" this man is not dangerous and the evidence shows he is not dangerous , " @entity52 said			0
he added that @entity1 is " flawed " but is " fundamentally decent			1
" @entity52 said that in the two and a half decades that @entity1 has been at @entity58 in @entity11 to undergo treatment and during his visits outside that facility , there has " not been a single act of violence			2
" since 1999 , @entity52 said , @entity1 has been taking a drug called @entity64			2
medical websites describe @entity64 as an antipsychotic medication often used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia			0
dr. @entity69 , director of psychiatry at @entity58 , testified @entity1 also started taking @entity71 in 2005 after complaining about anxiety			2
@entity69 said @entity1 had been diagnosed years ago as suffering from depression and from an unspecified psychotic disorder			2
but @entity69 said he 's been in remission for both of those disorders for many years			0
he said @entity1 also suffers from narcissism , which has improved but is still present			2
@entity69 said he has interviewed @entity35 but has not treated him			0
according to @entity69 , @entity1 's treatment team was informed by the @entity21 that @entity1 had not told the truth about his activities during several visits			2
@entity69 said the medical staff discussed this issue with @entity1 , who initially did not appear to view the issue as a big deal , but later understood it was a serious issue			2
although concerned @entity1 was not truthful about his activities , @entity69 said , " we did n't feel this constituted an increased risk			1
" the staff decided to reduce @entity1 's @entity93 visit to his mother from 10 days to five days , and he will not be allowed to have any unaccompanied activities during that december stay			2
@entity69 said the staff had considered stronger action including the possibility of revoking @entity1 's privileges altogether			2
a september filing by prosecutors said @entity1 " continues to be deceptive regarding his relationships with and interest in women			2
" according to the document , in june of 2009 he went on the @entity107 to find photos of his female dentist			0
" when he was caught , @entity1 claimed , falsely , that the dentist had invited him to view her personal photographs			2
" asked about the photographs of the dentist , @entity69 said the photographs were of the woman graduating from dental school and were " not salacious			0
" he said the hospital considers @entity1 " a low risk of violence to himself and others			1
" currently , @entity1 is allowed to visit his mother 10 days a month			0
on july 29 , @entity58 filed a proposal to increase that			0
the first step would allow @entity1 to have two visits of 17 days			0
that would be followed by six visits of 24 days			0
according to the september government filing opposing the plan , the hospital would then " be given the sole discretion to place @entity1 on convalescent leave in his mother 's hometown			1
" after the judge and all the lawyers were in place , @entity1 , now 56 , entered the court wearing a brown sports jacket , dark pants and a striped tie			0
he shook hands with all his lawyers and sat down			0
@entity145 district judge @entity144 greeted @entity1 and he replied , saying , " good morning			0
" @entity1 's defense team has listed him as a possible witness at the proceedings but has not revealed if he will definitely testify			1
prosecutors want to cross-examine @entity1 and his defense lawyers oppose that			1
mental health experts and secret service agents will testify , along with @entity1 's brother and sister			1
@entity1 's mother is now 85 years old and is not a scheduled witness			0
the hearing is scheduled to run about a week and a half			0
it 's not clear how quickly the judge might issue a ruling on the hospital 's plan to gradually allow @entity1 greater freedom			1
on march 30 , 1981 , @entity1 waited for president @entity13 to leave a @entity168 after a speech			1
he opened fire and hit @entity13 , his press secretary , @entity172 , @entity21 agent @entity173 and @entity11 police officer @entity174			0
all survived , but @entity172 suffered a serious head wound that permanently affected his mobility and his speech			0
@entity1 , who was 25 at the time of the shooting , was enamored of actress @entity180			0
he left a letter addressed to her in his @entity11 hotel room saying , " @entity184			0
there is a definite possibility i will be killed in my attempt to get @entity13			0

defense attorneys want @entity1 to be *transitioned* out of a mental hospital
" the hospital does n't know what mr. @entity1 is thinking , " the prosecutor says
the hearing may determine whether to eventually free him from a mental hospital
after @entity1 shot @entity13 , he was found not guilty by reason of insanity
