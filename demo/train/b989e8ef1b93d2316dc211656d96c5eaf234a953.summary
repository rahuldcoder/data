@entity0 -- the jazz record was only three minutes long , but it was enough time to cast a spell on a wealthy @entity7 heiress who became determined to meet the artist behind the beautiful ballad with the haunting overtones			1
that record was " @entity18 , " by a relatively unknown jazz pianist @entity12 and hearing it would herald the start of a life - long friendship between him and heiress @entity17			1
born into the hugely wealthy @entity19 and married to a @entity21 diplomat , the baroness , known as @entity23 , gave up a world of privilege for the love of jazz and devoted herself to @entity12 , who was considered one of @entity32 's great musical geniuses			1
she later became known as " the @entity33 " — and could be spotted mingling with music legends of the bebop era , such as @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
to explore @entity23 's elusive past , @entity39 tells her great aunt 's mysterious life story in her book , " @entity44 : the search for @entity23 , the rebellious @entity46 "			1
@entity23 was first touched by jazz in 1948 while on a trip to @entity49			1
just before catching a flight to join her family , she stopped to visit a friend , the jazz musician @entity52 who put on " @entity18			2
" watch : @entity54 video of @entity12 performing " @entity18 " after hearing that record , the baroness ' life changed forever , recalls @entity46			1
" it was like the vinyl version of a spell being cast			0
" " it quite literally spirited her from one world to another and she never went home			0
she missed every single plane , stayed in @entity49 , determined to meet this man @entity12			1
" in that very moment , she left her husband and five children behind and devoted herself to meeting the legendary musician			0
armed with a mile long cigarette holder , a fur coat and a set of pearls , @entity23 could be found swaying to the blues in the big apple 's jazz clubs or ferrying bands to performances in her convertible @entity84			2
but @entity23 did n't find herself in the presence of @entity12 until some years later at the ' @entity86 ' concert in @entity88			2
she was introduced to @entity12 backstage by a mutual friend - pianist @entity89 -- " and once they met they were inseparable " , notes @entity46			1
though @entity12 was married , the relationship between the @entity93 and him remained platonic , according to @entity46 's research			2
" i believe what kept them together was their love of music , particularly his music might i add			2
a real sense of companionship and friendship			0
" part of @entity23 's passion for jazz could be traced back to her experience during @entity109 with @entity111 relatives disappearing in the @entity112 , she played an active role in the war and even fought in the battlefields of @entity116 for @entity118 's @entity117 in @entity119			0
after serving in numerous capacities , she ended the war as a decorated lieutenant			0
" she had a very interesting war and when she came back it was impossible for her to settle down to a life of normalcy and domesticity , " explains @entity46			0
while @entity23 never took up composing or playing music herself , she remained a friend and philanthropist to the genre			0
as a result , she was a source of material for a dozen songs composed by jazz greats			2
songs included @entity137 's " @entity23 " , @entity139 's " @entity138 " , @entity141 's " @entity140 " — to name a few			0
the baroness remained close friends with @entity12 , funding his performances and even went to jail for him			1
the incident happened in 1958 when police stopped the pair en route to an out - of - town gig and found a small amount of @entity12 's marijuana in her car			1
@entity23 claimed it was hers and she was sentenced to three years in prison			0
after a two - year legal battle funded by the @entity46 's , the case was dismissed on a technicality in the appeal court			0
in @entity12 's last years , he suffered from mental health problems and withdrew from playing jazz altogether by secluding himself in @entity23 's @entity166 home			1
but at his funeral — @entity12 died in 1982 , from a stroke , both his wife @entity169 and @entity23 were greeted by mourners as widows			2
six years after @entity12 's death , @entity23 passed away , aged 74 , after undergoing a heart valve operation			0
though @entity46 only met her great aunt a handful of times on her visits to @entity49 , she was devastated by the loss			1
" i went into a silent mourning of not having spent more time with her and not having asked those questions , " recalls @entity46			0
" it occurred to me one day that just because somebody has died or passed on , it does n't mean that your relationship with them is completely over			0
" and each time @entity46 listens to that infamous @entity12 record , she wonders , " maybe this time it 'll change my life and i 'll leave my children and my country and my friends — but it has n't happened yet			1
