@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity7 @entity6 is on the hunt for a new location to hold its final public hearing on a planned study of hydraulic fracturing , the controversial process used to extract natural gas from underground , agency officials say			1
" we wanted a central location and wanted to keep it in the area where the drilling has been proposed			2
we 're leaving no stone unturned , " said agency spokeswoman @entity17			2
" we are pushing to make an announcement as swiftly as possible			0
" in july , public hearings were held in @entity21 , @entity22 ; @entity23 , @entity24 ; and @entity25 , @entity1 , to help determine how the @entity6 will conduct the study			0
a final public hearing was slated for thursday at @entity29 , @entity30 , but on monday it was rescheduled for saturday in @entity31 , @entity30 , and on tuesday it was postponed indefinitely , agency officials said			1
about 1,800 people had registered to speak for two minutes each , @entity17 said			1
both of the proposed venues , @entity35 and @entity31 's @entity36 , expressed concern about hosting an event estimated to attract 8,000 people			1
" the last - minute change to @entity31 was caused by @entity35 taking several actions to dissuade the @entity6 from holding the meetings at its campus , including increasing the cost from $ 6,000 to almost $ 40,000 , " the @entity6 said in a statement tuesday			1
the university issued a statement putting the cost at $ 32,000 , which it said included " all of the estimated operational costs that the university believed it would incur in order to ensure that activities associated with these meetings would be carried out in a safe and orderly manner			0
" the @entity6 now is planning to hold the meeting in september at a location in @entity57 that will be announced as soon as it is confirmed , @entity17 said			1
the meeting is open to industry stakeholders and the general public			1
@entity60 , who registered to speak at thursday 's hearing , is among 15 residents of the northeastern @entity1 township of @entity64 who filed suit in november 2009 against @entity67 , alleging it contaminated their well water			1
@entity67 solicited @entity60 for a gas lease in 2006 , according to court records			1
changing the location and then postponing the meeting was upsetting but did not come as a total surprise , @entity60 said			1
" i had a feeling it was going to be big , but it 's absurd , " she said			0
" who 's leading this pack ? " asked @entity60 , a former schoolteacher			0
" i am against drilling as it 's going now			0
they need to step back , call a moratorium and do some serious geological studying			0
" @entity84 of @entity64 planned to attend the @entity6 meeting with her husband , @entity87 , a cable splicer , and 17 - year - old daughter @entity89			1
they also are a part of the lawsuit			0
" we might seem small , but we 're here , too , and we 're fighting the industry not to pollute , and were fighting for the future generations , " said @entity84 , who added she has been unable to use her well water for nearly two years			1
" we 're not mad at anybody but we 're stuck here			0
" the @entity6 announced in march that it would study the potential adverse impact that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water , human health and the environment , agency officials said			2
" people have raised important concerns that require our attention , " said @entity104 , @entity6 liaison on hydraulic fracturing from the agency 's the @entity107			2
" i 've worked for @entity6 for a long time , i was here in the early ' 80s , this is a case that is unusual			0
" hydraulic fracturing is used by gas producers to stimulate wells and recover natural gas from sources including coalbeds and shale gas formations , said @entity104			1
the process requires the injection of fluids -- generally water and chemical additives			2
" we need to have a baseline to get an idea of what the effects of that are , and if you 're doing monitoring you have to know what to look for , " she said			0
" at the federal level there is no requirement that companies have to tell us what they use and what concentrations			0
" the @entity6 plans to complete the study design by september 2010 , begin the study in january 2011 and release initial results by late 2012 , she said			2
" this is an expedited process ; it usually takes longer , " @entity104 said of the timeline			0
" as we get results , we 're going to be reporting them			0

the large number of people expected to attend has caused two venues to increase fees
a meeting is now planned for september in *upstate* @entity30
well owners contend natural gas extraction has contaminated their water supplies
