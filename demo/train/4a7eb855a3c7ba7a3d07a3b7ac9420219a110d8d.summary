-- even as @entity2 reels from the horrific massacre in @entity4 , @entity5 , the clock continues to count down toward the so - called " fiscal cliff			1
" in the face of a legitimate crisis , it is harder to stomach manufactured ones			1
and that 's exactly what the so - called fiscal cliff is			1
in fact , every time i hear the term , i want to slam my head on the table			2
luckily , i 'm not alone			2
today , december 19 , a collection of artists are coming together to expose the " fiscal cliff " as a " fiscal bluff , " and remind progressives of the power of culture in helping to win the long - term war of ideas			1
my organization , @entity29 , is joining artist groups @entity32 and @entity33 on a special project : " @entity35 : @entity2 's @entity36 , @entity2 is being robbed			0
" on wednesday , with the help of @entity29 's members and partners , millions of people will see works of art that convey what is at stake in the big budget fight			1
some of the artwork takes the form of arresting and powerful visuals with a fierce message			0
other works explain what is happening in @entity52 , or graphically depict the choice our nation faces			2
there are songs and videos touching on issues from student debt to long - ignored poverty			0
not every piece frames the debate exactly as i would , and i may not share every artist 's exact view			0
but that 's not the point of a project like this			0
i believe this project conveys a message that policymakers need to hear			0
and it could n't come at a more urgent moment than now , as reports indicate president @entity76 and @entity78 speaker @entity77 could be nearing a deal that slashes @entity80 , cuts benefits for veterans and raises taxes on the poor and middle class to pay for the @entity86 wars , tax cuts and bailouts			2
our country is in the midst of a massive jobs crisis , the next generation is saddled in debt , the climate crisis is rapidly approaching a point of no return and now unspeakable gun violence shatters the heart of our nation			1
instead of tackling these problems , some of our nation 's leaders are apparently contemplating putting @entity80 , and maybe @entity104 , on the chopping block in a panic move -- all to avoid an artificially contrived deadline			0
we can make a huge dent in the rest of the deficit just by returning to the higher taxes and lower defense spending of the @entity114 boom years , asking those who do well in @entity2 to do well by @entity2			1
@entity52 should also deal with spending by cutting wasteful subsidies to oil companies , defense contractors and agribusinesses that do little but line @entity122 ' pockets with our tax dollars			1
the main part of the cliff that worries me is taxes going up on poor and middle - class @entity2			1
the @entity78 could fix that with one vote to extend the current low rates			0
we need to spread the word , and i am glad that artists are leading the way			2
artists have been at the forefront of all great modern social movements			1
they inspire people to dream bigger , force us to imagine a different world and confront people with new ideas			0
we must embrace the power of art to better protect the @entity147 for generations to come			0
we should never allow @entity52 politicians to stampede the @entity2 people into supporting cuts they otherwise would never accept			0
they 're bluffing -- and hoping we fold			0
it 's not a fiscal cliff , it 's a fiscal bluff			1
and as our nation struggles to deal with real emergencies , i am glad that @entity2 's artists are calling them on it			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			1

@entity161 : after @entity4 , it is hard to stomach an artificial crisis like the fiscal cliff
@entity161 : artists ' works expose fiscal cliff as a bluff to cut essential programs
@entity161 : we need a return to higher taxes , lower defense spending of @entity114 years
listen to artists , he says . they are in the forefront of many social movements
