@entity0 -- @entity0 is a conflicted city			0
it 's home to one of the largest gay pride festivals in the @entity5 and was once dubbed the " gayest city in @entity9 " by @entity7 magazine			2
the metropolitan area is also home to the conservative power base of rep. @entity13			2
and in six months , voters there and across the state will decide whether to amend the state 's constitution to ban same - sex marriage			1
it is one of four states where voters will cast ballots on the issue , along with @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
across the nation , 29 states have approved constitutional amendments banning same - sex marriage			1
six states and the @entity26 allow same - sex marriages while five states allow civil unions between same - sex couples			1
same - sex marriage by the numbers president @entity40 's may 9 announcement that he supports same - sex marriage helped mobilize activists for the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( @entity46 ) community in @entity47			1
the day after @entity40 spoke , " more than twice as many " people signed up to volunteer for @entity49 for all families than on previous days , according to the group 's campaign manager @entity51			1
@entity51 's group is working to defeat the november measure that would ban gay marriage			1
he said that even @entity58 voters ' decision on may 8 to ban same - sex marriage there helped energize @entity47 's @entity62 lobby to get out the vote in november			1
" [ @entity40 's decision and @entity58 's vote ] was an incredible one - two punch for us in @entity47 in terms of punching up the amount of energy , " @entity51 said			1
he added that the goal is to capitalize on the energy from both events			0
@entity74 and her partner of 31 years @entity76 , both volunteers for @entity49 for all families , desperately want to see the amendment defeated for both political and personal reasons			0
" @entity58 was kind of a wake - up call for everyone , " @entity81 said			2
she and @entity76 were legally married in @entity86 , but they would like nothing more than to walk down the aisle -- and have their commitment for each other recognized -- in their home state			0
" we want the equality of marriage that i do n't think we should be denied according to the @entity96 of this country , " said @entity76			2
in his recent announcement , @entity40 said while he personally supports same - sex marriage , he still believes the issue should be decided by each state			1
that 's something that @entity81 and @entity76 do n't agree with			2
" i think marriage is a fundamental right , " @entity81 said			0
" ( it ) should n't be determined on a state - by - state basis			0
" @entity76 said she 's believes that wo n't be @entity40 's position forever			1
" he had to start somewhere , " @entity76 added			0
" and where he started right now is a good beginning			0
i 'm hoping he will evolve into a stance where ... it is recognized nationwide			0
" the couple believes defeating the amendment will be an uphill battle , particularly when those on the opposing side have the resources of the @entity122 , they say			0
" i 'm hoping that we 're going to see the goodness of people of @entity47 come out , but it 's really hard to fight the church , " @entity76 said			2
" they have a built - in organization			0
" two years ago , the @entity0 - @entity131 archdiocese sent out 400,000 dvds to its parishioners urging them to support legislation banning same - sex marriage , even though the issue was n't even on the ballot			1
so far , catholic churches across the state have donated $ 350,000 to @entity47 for @entity140 , a group that supports the constitutional ban on same - sex marriage , according to @entity143 , executive director of the @entity144 , which represents the state 's catholic bishops			1
" the various dioceses are giving money to the @entity144 to use to support the marriage amendment , " @entity147 told @entity1			0
" we 're going to raise and spend the money we need to get the message out about what marriage is , why it 's important and what the consequences will be if it 's redefined			2
" advocacy groups opposed to same - sex marriage say their supporters also got a boost from @entity40 's comments			1
" [ president @entity40 's ] comments ... alerted our base to the fact that there are politicians who are trying to meddle with the definition of marriage , " said @entity165 , communications director for @entity47 for @entity140			1
" when they hear that they 're motivated to get out and do something to pass the marriage amendment			0
" the group 's chairman , @entity177 , said it 's too early to tell if there has been an increase in volunteers after @entity40 's statement			1
however , he agreed that the president 's admission that he supports same - sex marriage will help @entity47 for marriage rally supporters ahead of the november ballot			1
" that will energize them to make phone calls , knock on doors , and to make sure they turn out in november , " @entity177 said			0
while the recent media coverage of @entity58 's vote and @entity40 's comments have raised awareness of the issue , @entity47 for marriage volunteer @entity199 said this did not affect how hard he 's been campaigning against same - sex marriage			1
@entity199 , 25 , has been volunteering in support of the proposed amendment on behalf of the @entity122 since august			0
he personally believes that marriage should be between a man and a woman because " redefining marriage would diminish the importance of having the influence of the mother and the father on the life of a child			0
" " i see marriage as an institution primarily oriented to the raising and procreation of children , and i see that as why the government recognizes marriage , " @entity199 said			0
he said that does n't mean he is opposed to same - sex relationships			1
" i respect their right to live as they wish , and i do n't deny that there 's love in those relationships , " @entity199 explained			0
" but i see marriage as about a particular kind of love between a man and a woman that brings a child into the world			0
" while many predict this fight could get ugly as the two sides duke it out for the next six months , the same - sex marriage issue could also fade from voters ' minds by the time the november election rolls around			1
after all , economic issues are expected to be the top issue for voters across the @entity9 this fall			2
either way , it could help the president gain some voters , according to @entity252 political science professor @entity251			2
" social issues including gay marriage are unlikely to affect voter choice between [ @entity257 ] @entity256 and @entity40 , " @entity251 said			2
" but it could be a big tool for @entity40 to turn out disaffected @entity259 who are likely to sit out the election			2
" however @entity47 's voters decide on the proposed constitutional amendment to ban same - sex marriage , the issue is n't going away anytime soon , @entity251 said			1
" it does n't mean that gay marriage is coming to a state near you , " he said			0
" but it does begin to shift the balance and reflects a very significant shift in public thinking about gay marriage			0
" what are your top election issues of 2012 ? share what matters most to you on @entity279 and you could participate in the next round of the @entity281 !			0
