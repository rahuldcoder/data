-- the liberation of @entity2 begins now			1
@entity3 is leaving the city and you are free , dear people , to speak the truth			1
no longer do you have to cower			0
no longer do you have to worry about stern looks and furious retorts			0
no longer do you have to tiptoe around the mighty slugger and his ruthian numbers , fearful that he might say to hell with riverboat casinos and go elsewhere , someplace warmer			0
no longer do you have to mindlessly utter the @entity14 company lines about all of @entity3 ' charity work and family life and what a wonderful person he is			1
with thursday 's news that @entity3 has agreed to a 10 - year , $ 254 million contract with the @entity25 , @entity20 officials , players and fans are finally permitted say what has gone unsaid far too long -- that @entity3 is a pain in the rear			1
he is a devout @entity35 who has written , " my life 's goal is to bring glory to @entity40			2
" his foundation raises large bundles of money to help kids with @entity44 ( and if you do n't believe this , ask anyone associated with @entity3			1
he has never , apparently , drowned a dog or shot himself in the leg			0
over the past 11 years , @entity2 ' slugging infielder could do no wrong			1
and yes , it helped that he averaged 42 homers and 126 rbis while leading the club to two @entity58 titles			0
and yet ... for the hundreds of people who work for the @entity20 , and for the majority of the thousands upon thousands of fans who have asked @entity3 for an autograph or a handshake or the smallest of words , the three - time @entity59 is , well , terrible			1
having now covered sports for 17 years , i 've witnessed few professional athletes who show greater disrespect and outright disdain for loyalists than @entity3			1
he is a man who , during spring training , walks from station to station with his head down ; who responds to " @entity3 , we love you ! " not with a smile or a nod , but with cold nothingness			1
when people call his name , he almost never gazes up			0
when people ask for an autograph , he does n't even bother with a " not now " or " try me later			0
" instead , he turns to devices that men such as @entity88 and @entity89 perfected in the recent decades -- the steel - faced , how - dare - you - even - talk - to - me , ignore - the - world two - step			0
it 's not a problem that @entity3 does n't say much -- neither does @entity97			1
it 's not that @entity3 is intense -- @entity99 is certainly right there with him			1
no , what rubs so many people wrongly is his frostiness			0
or , as one longtime @entity20 usher told me last march , " how about looking up at people when they talk to you ? how about acknowledging that they exist ? " during the waning days of last spring training , i stood alongside @entity3 ' table during the annual @entity112 at @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity115			1
admittedly , the event is one that no player enjoys ; a contrived , goofy , strictly - for - the - benefit - of - the - fans labor of torturous obligation			0
here is a direct , play - by - play transcript from the opening minutes : fan : " @entity3 , great to meet you ! you 're my favorite player in the world ! " @entity3 ( not looking up ) : " thanks			2
" @entity129 : " @entity3 , do you sign jerseys ? " @entity3 : ( not looking up ) : " no. " fan 2 : " @entity131 ? " @entity3 ( not looking up ) : " no. " @entity132 : " good luck this year , @entity3			2
you deserve everything you get			0
" @entity3 ( not looking up ) : " uh-huh			2
" @entity136 : " @entity3 , my daughter loves you			2
" @entity3 ( not looking up ) : because of his endorsement deal with @entity139 , @entity3 signed only pictures and baseballs ( every other player signed whatever was presented to him )			2
to call him rude would be to personify an utter lack of emotion			0
pujols was n't rude -- he was absent			0
and yet , because baseball lathers itself in mythology , and because @entity3 was @entity2 ' @entity153 , and because @entity2 clutches onto its ballplayers the way a 5 - year - old clutches her @entity149 doll , nothing negative could ever be said			1
truth be told , inside the @entity20 ' clubhouse @entity3 was , on his best days , pleasantly present			1
when asked , younger players would praise his leadership skills because , frankly , that 's what young players do			0
yet with last season 's arrival of the affable , open , intelligent @entity167 , members of the team were able to witness what genuine leadership looks like			0
now , @entity3 -- perhaps the most revered cardinal since @entity171 -- has pulled a @entity173 @entity172 , abandoning his adopted hometown when bigger bucks and a sniff of @entity177 came calling			1
whereas once he had a chance to stand alongside @entity179 and @entity180 and @entity181 and @entity182 as legends who spent their entire careers with one franchise , now he is but a nomad -- richer , without question , but shockingly smaller in stature			0
though the idea of @entity3 in an @entity25 uniform seems strange at this moment , our eyes will inevitably adjust			1
and in @entity2 , i believe , so will opinions			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			2

@entity3 is leaving the @entity20 , and @entity2 should be relieved , @entity198 says
@entity3 may be worth a $ 254 million contract with the @entity25 , but he 's a pain , @entity198 says
@entity198 says he 's seen few pro athletes who show more disrespect for loyalists
@entity3 was @entity2 ' @entity153 , and nothing negative could ever be said -- until now , he says
