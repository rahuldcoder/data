@entity0 -- a congressional committee on tuesday subpoenaed current and former top @entity4 officials related to the development of " talking points " by the @entity8 administration to publicly explain the deadly attack on the @entity11 diplomatic compound in @entity12 , @entity13 , last year			1
the @entity14 sought documents and communications from 10 people , including the agency 's no. 2 official , the top aide to then - secretary of state @entity21 , and the department 's former spokeswoman , the panel 's chairman , @entity26 , said in a statement			1
the @entity4 has refused multiple requests to provide the communications and documents voluntarily , according to the committee , which has been investigating the administration 's handling of the attack last september 11			2
the probe has centered partly on the evolution of unclassified @entity38 talking points requested by a member of @entity40 in the days following the attack for use in media interviews			1
a senior administration official , @entity45 ambassador @entity44 , wound up relying on them when discussing the attack on television news programs			0
@entity49 releases @entity12 e-mails " the @entity4 has not lived up to the administration 's broad and unambiguous promises of cooperation with @entity40			1
therefore , i am left with no alternative but to compel the @entity4 to produce relevant documents through a subpoena , " @entity26 , a @entity55 @entity54 , said in a letter to secretary of state @entity57			2
but the @entity4 said it has responded in great detail to congressional inquiries about @entity12 , providing documents and other information since the attack by armed militants on the diplomatic outpost that killed ambassador @entity68 and three other @entity11			2
" the @entity4 remains committed to working cooperatively with the @entity40 , and we will take stock of any new or outstanding requests for information , and determine the appropriate next steps , " said @entity69 , a department spokesman			0
the talking points have become a political flashpoint in a long - running battle between the administration and @entity54 , who accuse it of not bolstering security before the attack , of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the november election			1
the @entity54 suggests that the administration removed specific terror references and stuck to an explanation -- later proved untrue -- that the attack was result of a spontaneous demonstration over an @entity93 film that was produced in the @entity11			0
the @entity49 and its allies in @entity40 have made the case that any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the assault stemmed from the " fog of war , " not any deliberate effort to mislead the public			0
@entity8 has called @entity54 concentration on the talking points a political " side show			1
" rep. @entity105 of @entity106 , the top @entity107 on the @entity109 panel , suggested republicans continue to aggressively pursue the @entity12 investigation partly to tarnish @entity112 , who is viewed as a potential @entity114 presidential candidate in 2016			2
" this investigation has been politicized from the beginning as @entity49 @entity54 accuse first and then scramble to find evidence to back up their unsubstantiated claims , " @entity105 said			0
the @entity49 earlier this month released 100 pages of e-mails around the development of the @entity12 talking points in an effort to defuse the controversy by showing that officials working on them were focused on events , not politics			1
the e-mails indicate the @entity38 was likely the lead organization in developing the talking points with the @entity4 suggesting significant changes			1
but @entity26 said the e-mails released by the @entity49 failed to answer the committee 's " outstanding questions			2
" he specifically cited reservations expressed by then @entity4 spokeswoman @entity135 about key points in the early draft of the document			0
@entity140 , deputy secretary @entity141 , @entity142 , principle deputy assistant secretary for @entity144 affairs ; @entity145 , acting assistant secretary for @entity144 affairs ; @entity146 , under secretary for management ; and @entity148 , counselor and chief of staff to @entity112 , were among those named in the subpoena			0
@entity26 has given the @entity4 until june 7 to comply			0
@entity1 's @entity152 contributed to this report .			0
