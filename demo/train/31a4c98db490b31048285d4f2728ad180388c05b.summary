for 10 days following the 2010 @entity2 earthquake , two @entity0 colleagues and i lived in a tent hospital run by @entity6			1
our hearts ached as we heard the cries of the injured , as we watched surgeons performed amputations without general anesthesia , as people died in front of our eyes			0
but , in the midst of this despair , a miracle arrived at @entity6			0
@entity0 senior photographer @entity19 caught these images seconds after she arrived			0
look closely at the center of the photo			0
this 4 - month - old baby had spent four days alone in the rubble and was unconscious and extremely dehydrated			1
no one knew if she would live or die			0
but look at her now ! @entity0 medical producer @entity26 and i had the pure joy of seeing this wonderful young lady again last week			2
her name is @entity32 , and she 's 5 years old and a pre-kindergartner in @entity34			1
she can write her name and loves to color and dress up as a princess and is adorable and spunky and smart and funny			0
here are all the miracles that it took to save her life : 1			0
that someone happened to find @entity32 in the rubble four days after the quake			1
that at a time when vehicles were in short supply , @entity32 's rescuers flagged down a car to rush her to the hospital			1
that the medishare team of doctors and nurses , led by dr. @entity55 , an emergency medicine physician at @entity56 , managed to get fluids into her			0
@entity32 was so dehydrated her veins had collapsed and @entity55 had to put a needle through her shinbone and directly into her bone marrow to deliver fluids			1
they did n't have to sedate her -- @entity32 was so unconscious she did n't even cry			1
here 's @entity55 reunited with @entity32 a year after her rescue			1
that @entity6 found a flight headed immediately to @entity34 , because she needed surgery the tent hospital could n't provide			0
hospital workers flagged down a @entity71 truck and promised the driver they 'd name the baby after her if she got the airport on time			2
that the baby , then named @entity76 after the truck driver , survived the flight to @entity34 and the emergency surgery			2
when the baby arrived in @entity34 , it was presumed her parents were dead			1
she 'd been found in the rubble next to the body of a woman , thought to be her mother			2
but that woman turned out to be her baby sitter			0
shortly after the baby arrived in @entity34 , a couple came forward saying they were her parents			2
many people doubted them , thinking they just wanted to get to @entity34 , but dna testing showed they were telling the truth and the baby 's name was actually @entity32			1
now @entity32 and her parents , @entity98 and @entity99 , and her 17 - month - old little sister , @entity100 , live in an apartment in @entity34			1
her parents have explained to @entity32 that the bumpy scars on her left arm are from when she was crushed in the rubble of the @entity2 earthquake			1
they 've told her she 's a miracle , that @entity107 saved her			0
@entity32 nods her head and says she understands			2
but really she 's a little embarrassed by all the attention and just wants to go put on her @entity111 dress and go outside and ride her bike and then draw pictures of big red flowers under a sun and sign her name : @entity117 .			0

a 4 - month - old baby spent four days alone in the rubble after the @entity2 earthquake
@entity32 was *evacuated* to @entity123 for medical treatment ; only later were her parents able to claim her
five years later , she is a happy and *healthy* little girl
