@entity3 , @entity4 when the @entity6 and its salvage convoy finally depart @entity3 , the residents of this picturesque @entity2 island will breathe a collective sigh of relief -- and shed a collective tear			1
nothing much ever happened on @entity3 before the doomed cruise liner crashed here on that fateful friday the 13th in january 2012			1
there were the odd inconveniences , like when bad weather stopped the ferries and cut off the island from the mainland , leaving the local population of about 900 people with limited supplies			2
the island had its fair share of tourists , but according to mayor @entity28 , @entity27 came to camp and there were pockets of @entity32 who came to bird watch , but none of them left much of an impact			2
" we were a perfect place , a best kept secret , " he told @entity5			0
that all changed shortly after the @entity6 ran aground , killing 32 passengers and crew as it capsized and then sank into the pristine coral reefs near the harbor on the eastern side of @entity3			1
within a few weeks of the disaster , foreign salvage crews moved in , first to defuel the crippled vessel and later to remove it			1
@entity48 with a @entity2 accent was no longer the language of commerce on the island			1
if the local businesses wanted to cater to the crews -- some 600 workers from 29 different countries at the height of the operation -- they had to learn at least a little bit of @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity27 or @entity63			1
the languages have infiltrated the local dialect			0
the locals have also had to adjust their menus and hours of business to accommodate the crews ' varied tastes and round - the - clock shifts			2
suddenly , @entity3 's bars and pizza joints found themselves serving lunch fare at night for the workers who needed packed lunches for their graveyard shift -- and beer at 7:00 am for the workers who were just coming in off the rigs who wanted an after - work drink			1
" our whole perspective changed , " @entity83 , owner of @entity84 in the center of the port -- a favorite spot for the salvage crews -- told @entity5			2
" no one ever challenged our way of doing things before			0
we were set in our ways and then suddenly our little island had to adjust to one of the most diverse populations anywhere in @entity4			1
can we go back to how we were before ? i do n't know how to do that			0
" @entity83 is one of the lucky @entity100 whose business boomed when the crews came			2
she offered up a " lunch to go " service to make packed lunches for the crews to take on site , and allowed @entity103 -- the firm behind the salvage of the @entity6 -- to set up a credit system so workers could sign for their meals			1
and despite being forced to serve bacon and egg baguettes and chicken salad sandwiches with pickles , which she said she has yet to sample , she says she will miss the workers when they go			2
" our lives have been so enriched by this experience , and i do n't mean monetarily			0
i 've met people from @entity121 , from @entity122 , from places i had never heard of , " she said , her eyes welling up with tears			0
" they 've brought their families , they show us pictures from home			0
and now we will lose them all			0
they wo n't come back			0
" the sentiment is echoed along the port , where locals have given the ship nicknames like " the tomb , " " the dead whale " and the " astroship			0
" @entity140 , an @entity141 who has had a tourist rental business on the island for nearly 30 years , said the salvage workers have become like family			1
" we will miss them terribly , " she told @entity5			0
" we are going to be lost without them			0
" the @entity149 have adamantly refused to capitalize on the crash through tourist trinkets			0
you wo n't find t - shirts that say " i got wrecked on @entity3 , " or even models of the ship			1
but the island does have two memorials to the 32 victims of the disaster and the @entity63 diver who died during the salvage operation			2
one is a plaque with the victims ' names engraved on it affixed to the stone wall of the pier closest to the wreck			0
the other is a statue of the @entity171 donated by the husband of @entity173 , one of the last victims to be found			0
the statue 's neck is adorned with rosaries left by passengers and survivors ' families who have come to pay their respects on the island			2
father @entity183 of the local catholic church , which was a shelter for hundreds of passengers the night of the accident , has also created a museum in the church that includes life jackets from the ship , hard hats , a piece of rock from the bottom of the cruise liner and a tiny vial of oil from the @entity6 's engines , almost like a relic of blood from a saint			1
he also keeps a loaf of bread , meant to signify the feeding of the salvage crews , and the crucifix and communion tabernacle from inside the @entity6 's chapel			1
@entity183 also keeps the cards and letters passengers have written to @entity3 to thank the islanders for their help			1
but @entity183 's church has scars , too			0
there is a crack in the apse from the underground drilling to remove the ship , which he says the workers have promised to patch up			2
the crews working under the direction of @entity225 , the man overseeing the world 's biggest ever salvage project , have also been toying with the idea of leaving some sort of memorial made from the implements of salvage			2
according to @entity234 , workers have discussed building a funicular from the port to the town of @entity238 , high on a hill overlooking @entity3 's port			1
they may also try to leave behind some of the high - end fiber optic cables that were installed to give the island better internet and phone service as crews hatched their plan to raise the @entity6			1
@entity3 remains the epicenter of one of the most technically - advanced salvage operations on the planet , but you still ca n't buy a cellphone or computer charger anywhere on the island			1
whatever emotional scars from the shipwreck remain on the island , the physical scars are worse			2
no matter how diligently crews work to clean up the implements of salvage , @entity3 is indelibly marked with signs of the unspeakable tragedy that happened here			1
@entity3 's pristine underwater ecosystem has been marred by the 30,000 bags of cement and grout poured into the reef , along with the pillars drilled deep into the island 's bedrock in order to support the giant steel platforms that cradled the @entity6 for most of the past year			1
when all of the cement and steel is finally removed , the seabed will have to heal itself			0
all of the underwater grasses and mollusk fields that were relocated when the ship crashed will have to be moved back , even though they are thriving in their new environment			0
divers working on the site say the ship has also created a bizarre unnatural reef where fish and sea snakes swim among the pillars and in and out of the ship 's broken windows			0
several local dive companies want to create a new reef and dive school using the steel platforms that propped up the @entity6			1
but @entity299 , @entity4 's environmental minister , says that is not an option , even though the @entity149 have been presenting redevelopment plans that include keeping the platforms in place			1
" the platforms will be dismantled , " @entity299 told @entity5 , before adding that this was an @entity48 decision -- not one that could be made solely by the people of @entity3			1
" we have always hypothesized from the beginning that @entity3 would be returned to the same state as it was before the shipwreck and there were no platforms before the shipwreck			1
" @entity315 , who owns a popular restaurant in @entity238 and a dive company in @entity3 's port , disagrees			1
" it is a mistake to remove them when we could have one of the best dive sites in the world if we leave them , " she told @entity5			0
" it will disrupt the seabed for another two years to pull them out , like a rotten tooth from the seabed			0
let 's try to see the bright side and use them to bolster the local economy			0
" " when the ship is gone , it will be like this island is dying twice			0
let 's try to save ourselves			0
we are going to die here without that boat			0

foreign workers descended on @entity3 , @entity4 after the @entity6 crashed there in 2012
their arrival *transformed* the language , *culinary* scene and *nightlife* on the tiny @entity2 island
islanders are trying to come to terms with what life will be like when the foreign crews leave
