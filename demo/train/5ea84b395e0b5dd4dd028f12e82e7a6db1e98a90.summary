@entity1 's prince @entity0 has called on governments around the world to do more to ensure religious freedom and urged religious leaders to promote tolerance between people of different faiths			1
in a video message recorded to accompany the release of a new report on religious freedom , @entity0 said current events in @entity14 and @entity15 -- where @entity17 extremist group @entity16 has been massacring people of other faiths and sectarian tensions have flared -- were " horrendous and heartbreaking			1
" " we 've learned with mounting despair of the expulsion of @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 from towns and cities that their ancestors have occupied for centuries , " he said			0
" it is an indescribable tragedy that @entity33 is now under such threat in the @entity35 , an area where @entity23 have lived for 2,000 years and across which @entity36 spread in 700 a.d. , with people of different faiths living together peaceably for centuries			1
" the report , by @entity42 charity @entity41 , highlights the plight of @entity23 in particular , saying they " remain the most persecuted faith in the world			1
" it adds that " muslims also face serious persecution ; often from other @entity24 who do not share their exact same beliefs , " while @entity51 in parts of @entity53 are increasingly feeling threatened , prompting many to move to @entity54			0
prince @entity0 , who is heir to the @entity1 throne , pointed out that the issue of religious intolerance also affects some @entity59 nations and many countries across @entity61			1
but some hope can be found in the efforts of certain communities and faith leaders who work to overcome division and hatred , and seek instead to engage in interfaith dialogue , he said			0
faith leaders ' duty @entity0 , who referred to his own @entity33 faith in the video , suggested positive action to help tackle intolerance			1
" first and foremost , rather than remaining silent , faith leaders have -- it seems to me -- a responsibility to ensure that people within their own tradition respect people from other faith traditions , " he said			2
he also called on governments to honor their duty to uphold the freedom of people to practice their faith , including converting to a different religion if they choose			1
it 's a principle enshrined in @entity90 18 of the @entity92 @entity91			0
" yet even in the @entity94 this right is often challenged sadly -- and in many other countries , an absence of freedom to determine one 's own faith is woven into the laws and customs of the nation , " he said			2
@entity0 reflected on the case of @entity104 , a @entity105 @entity33 woman who faced a death sentence this year after refusing to renounce her faith			1
she was eventually released and , after meeting @entity108 in @entity109 , arrived in the @entity110 this summer to start a new life with her husband and children			0
and he urged those facing persecution not to give up hope , while remaining strong in their faith			0
" my heart goes out to all those around the world but especially at this time in the @entity35 , whether @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity51 , @entity122 or @entity123 , who are so brutally persecuted solely for the faith they profess , " he said			1
deteriorating conditions according to the report , which covers the period from october 2012 to june 2014 , 81 of 196 countries in the world , or 41 % , are identified as places where religious freedom is impaired or is in decline			2
another 35 countries were classified as having some religious freedom issues that are " of concern , " but with no deterioration in their status			0
change for the better is noted in only six countries , while conditions have deteriorated in 55 nations , the report 's authors found			0
overall , 20 countries are designated as having a high degree of religious persecution			0
