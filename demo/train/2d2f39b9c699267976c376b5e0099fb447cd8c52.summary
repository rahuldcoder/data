@entity0 and @entity1 are spending their retirement filling up their passports , one stamp at a time			0
" there are a bunch of people who are trying to visit 100 countries before they die , " @entity0 explained			0
" this is number 92 for us			0
" @entity11 92 for the @entity12 is @entity13			0
but up until a few years ago , even for intrepid travelers like the @entity12 , visiting @entity13 would have been close to impossible			0
after @entity15 took power in 1959 , @entity13 went from being a favorite getaway for @entity18 to a forbidden destination			1
diplomatic relations and direct travel between the @entity18 and @entity13 were cut off			1
@entity18 citizens spending money on the island faced hefty fines for " trading with the enemy			0
" but after decades of false starts , the @entity28 administration has reinstituted legal travel to @entity13 as a way to reach out to the @entity33 people			1
it 's called " people - to - people " travel , and like nearly everything involving @entity13 , controversy and politics are involved			1
" each traveler must have a full - time schedule of educational exchange activities that will result in meaningful interaction between the travelers and individuals in @entity13 , " @entity41 guidelines for people - to - people travel read			1
and while the policy has kicked off a debate over what is a " meaningful " exchange , a flood of tour operators has entered the still uncertain world of travel to @entity13			1
@entity18 interested in visiting @entity13 are offered free cds of @entity33 music and itineraries that include welcome parties thrown by @entity62 , neighborhood watch groups that were created with the original intention of thwarting a @entity18 invasion			1
@entity18 visitors coming via people - to - people trips should n't plan on too much beach time			1
under the @entity41 guidelines , tour operators have to plan nearly every moment of the trip , and " people - to - people " travel , at least in theory , excludes relaxing by the pool with umbrella - topped beverages			2
most @entity18 heading to @entity13 go there with the desire to make a connection with a people they have been prevented from having any contact with for generations , according to @entity84 , president of tour operator insight @entity13			1
" the fact that we are bringing @entity18 and @entity33 together is an incredible thing , " @entity84 said			1
" it 's a travel experience for the @entity18 , it 's an incredible thing for @entity33			1
some people in parts of @entity13 that we go to , they have never met an @entity18 before			1
" people - to - people travel is n't cheap or easy , though			0
a four - night " @entity98 " trip from @entity13 , without airfare , sells for about $ 2,000 per person			1
@entity84 said the high cost of the trips is due to the fact that operators need to send guides with their groups to make sure they comply with the travel regulations , and that renewing the yearly @entity18 licenses can take months of navigating a complicated bureaucracy			1
this summer , many tour operators wondered if people - to - people travel was ending altogether , after the @entity41 started denying licenses to operators or simply not responding to renewal requests			1
several tour operators contacted by @entity115 said that the process may have gotten bogged down by the fact that the renewal application is now close to 200 pages and requires that the operators explain how each stop on the itinerary fosters greater friendship between @entity18 and @entity33			1
" you are doing what you are supposed to be doing and they are changing the rules as we go			0
the guidelines are so vague , " said @entity129 , who ran the now - defunct @entity130			0
@entity129 laid off four employees after his license expired in july and he was denied a renewal			0
" the language is so cryptic and so bureaucratic , " he said			0
" your average @entity136 is n't able to do this -- you have to understand the secret language			0
" @entity129 has now hired what he calls a " bloody expensive " lawyer to guide him through the process , and he is hopeful that he will be back to planning trips to @entity13 by the end of the year			2
some of the tour operators said they thought the logjam of licenses was caused by political pressure , particularly from sen. @entity149 , @entity150 , who is @entity151 and a fierce critic of the trips " what these trips are all about is tourism -- it 's tourism , " @entity149 said on the @entity155 floor last year			2
" the reason why this is problematic is it gives money to the @entity15 government			0
" @entity164 , a @entity41 official in charge of the @entity13 licensing program , said in an e-mail that the department has approved licenses for 180 tour operators while making sure they are complying with the law			1
" we revised the license application criteria to stress to applicants the seriousness of the requirements of the people - to - people licensing program , in part because of reports we received concerning travel under the licenses , " @entity164 wrote			2
but some tour operators said travel to @entity13 has become more cumbersome and expensive but is not policed any better			2
one tour organizer mentioned a recent licensed trip offered by a competitor that included a day of scuba diving			0
" it 's supposed to be people - to - people , not people - to - fish , " the operator said			0
and there are also complications on the @entity33 side , tour operators said			2
last month , the @entity33 government abruptly canceled the landing rights for two of the @entity18 charter companies operating flights to the island , reportedly over a payment dispute			2
but most of the tour operators said the headaches are worth the opportunity to get in early on @entity18 tourism to @entity13 , which is sure to explode when the embargo is eventually lifted			1
" we are back in operations and hope to stay that way , " insight @entity13 president @entity84 said			0
@entity84 had to lay off 22 people as he waited several months for the company 's license renewal , but he has since added 17 back to his staff			0
on a trip organized by @entity222 last month , 12 @entity18 spent their morning speaking with @entity33 at a neighborhood art project			2
@entity224 , a lawyer from @entity225 , @entity226 , said he was struck by @entity13 's many contrasts during his first people - to - people trip in may			2
" i love @entity13 , " he said			0
" the history , music , people , photography -- it 's all beautiful			0
" the politics and uncertainty over continued travel between @entity13 and the @entity18 persuaded @entity224 to book another trip right away , he said			1
" one of the reasons i came again is because you never know when you might be able to come legally			0
