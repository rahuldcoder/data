@entity0 , @entity1 -- they are so used to seeing blood outside @entity8 hospital , the magnet of all suffering in @entity0 , that passersby simply walk over it , oblivious			1
when they mop out the building 's tiny reception area , the blood runs in small , dirty streams into the gutters			2
this is a hospital trying to get by day - to - day while lacking the most basic in supplies			2
it has itself been hit by shelling : two separate attacks have left its right side punctured with gaping holes in what was once the maternity ward			2
one afternoon , a rush of the most frail and vulnerable come towards the exhausted doctors ; children , some suffering from sheer terror			1
they have cuts , bruises -- but more often much worse			2
the government has , the doctors say , closed the main children 's hospital owing to a paperwork issue , so this is where they must come			1
baby survives as family dies in @entity1 onslaught @entity42 is aged eight and was hit by shrapnel from regime shelling in his right leg			1
in @entity50 , surgery would mean he 's playing football again within months , but here a list of precarious challenges form			2
he remains quiet , brave , patient almost , as the doctors work out what to do			2
the tough natural solution they hit on is a stark reminder of how desperate the task is of getting medical care to the wounded here in rebel - held territory			1
the government hospital has better equipment , and can probably save @entity42 's leg			1
so , lifting him on the blankets they use as makeshift stretchers , they take him , bewildered and confused , into a nearby taxi to cross the front lines			1
his ordeal is far from over			0
it is perverse to know that only those who hurt him can also heal him			0
a @entity1 family 's desperate story @entity1 president @entity79 , whose face adorns plastic skeletons used as teaching aids and trash cans inside @entity8 , still controls the best hospitals and much of the most precious medical resource : doctors			1
one medic , terrified enough that he does n't want his face or voice on camera , is absurdly brave in the risks he takes every day to work in @entity8			1
during the morning and afternoon , he works in the government hospital			1
but later , he too crosses the line to come here			1
he paints a gruesome picture of caring for the @entity1 regime 's soldiers			1
fifty a day are brought in , he tells me			0
some are so wounded the doctors make a decision , he says , that sounds like it is born of mercy and perhaps rebel sympathies			0
those soldiers with the worst , perhaps unsurvivable , injuries are given lethal injections			1
he tells me : " if they found out i was working here , they would kill me			0
" slain journalist 's partner tells of grief suddenly , a truck arrives outside and little @entity114 is rushed inside			0
his right ear is hanging on only by a small thread of skin			0
shrapnel -- as indiscriminate when it lands as the means by which it is fired -- hit the back of his head			0
the doctors work to clean the wound , but , as too often is the case , the lights and power fail			0
he lies there as a doctor with a head torch tries to pull the shrapnel from his head			1
the anesthetic they gave is not enough to stop him screaming in pain			0
but this is not the worst that will befall @entity114			2
as he lies there , outside in the back of a truck slumps his father @entity144 , lifeless , a hole in his chest from the same shrapnel			0
" @entity150 " cry the men around his corpse			0
" they leave his body in the sidewalk until his brother arrives			0
later his family will quickly drive the body away , so @entity114 can learn of his father 's death at a more dignified time .			0

children have become some of the main *casualties* during the @entity1 civil war
every hour , medical staff face *dilemmas* on how to ensure patients can be saved
doctor : regime soldiers with worst , perhaps unsurvivable , injuries are given lethal injections
injured children are carried across front line to ensure better care in government hospitals
