@entity0 , @entity1 -- the town of @entity6 , on the banks of the @entity4 , was made famous by the legendary @entity7 , one of a legion of great guitarists to emerge from @entity1			1
but nowadays , @entity6 is known as a battleground as @entity1 disintegrates and a mix of hard - line @entity12 and ethnic @entity15 rebels tighten their grip on the northern two - thirds of the country			1
@entity19 , an @entity20 teacher from the town , knows just how hard - line the new arrivals are			0
he said a friend was brutally beaten on a @entity6 street after @entity25 caught him with a flask of alcohol in his pocket			0
@entity19 also enjoys beer , a cigarette and music -- all " vices " abhorred by the @entity25 of a movement known as @entity34 -- so he fled			0
his story is all too typical			0
@entity1 , traditionally a tolerant society , has become bitterly divided in the wake of a rebellion by the @entity15 , a nomadic people who inhabit the north of this country as well as areas of @entity4 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
@entity6 was one of the initial towns the @entity15 attacked in january , sparking a coup by disgruntled @entity1 soldiers			1
the soldiers , running low on ammunition and food in the face of rapid rebel advances , abandoned their northern bases en masse			1
they felt that political elites in the far - off capital of @entity58 had virtually abandoned them			2
into the chaos has stepped @entity34 , a @entity15 - led @entity62 militant group whose primary objective is to impose sharia law in @entity1 , and an exodus of well - armed @entity15 from @entity43 , where many fought for @entity67			1
no longer welcome in @entity43 , these battle - hardened @entity15 fighters traversed @entity70 pistes to return to their homeland in northern @entity1 , which is known as @entity72 in their indigenous language			1
@entity67 's spy chief goes on trial in @entity43 the separatist @entity76 , or @entity76 , formally declared its independence from @entity1 in april , and last month it announced that had joined forces with @entity34			1
the @entity76 cooled to this alliance when the two could not agree on how it would share power , but @entity1 , one of @entity85 's poorest countries , is now in a state of protracted limbo			1
and it 's this uncertainty -- this messy , unpredictable war in a country known as @entity85 's crossroads -- that threatens the region and has created concern that northern @entity1 could become a new terrorist haven			1
stalemate of suspicion nearly 400 miles northeast of @entity58 , along a winding , dusty highway dotted with spartan roadside villages , is the town of @entity0			0
@entity1 security forces have erected a series of checkpoints around the town that amount to internal border crossings			1
to travel farther north , toward rebel - held territory , invites extreme suspicion			2
those on ancient , creaking buses bound for @entity109 or @entity110 have their belongings meticulously pulled apart by cautious local police			0
at @entity116 's southern edge , passengers queue up in the stifling midday heat at a garbage - strewn checkpoint to press their case for heading into rebel - held lands			2
there is scant sympathy for their plight			0
after passing through the city , they are then subject to another checkpoint on its northern fringe			2
@entity116 is the town of @entity130 , on the banks of the @entity4			0
it is supposedly held by a dispirited mix of @entity1 troops , gendarmes , national guard and police			1
it is the last population center claimed to be in government hands			2
but @entity139 , a young @entity15 employed by a @entity141 nongovernmental organization , described @entity58 's hold on @entity130 as more tenuous than the central government was admitting			1
@entity144 , 75 miles away , is now in the hands of the @entity76			0
the famed city of @entity110 , not so long ago a popular tourist destination for adventurous @entity148 , is now ruled by @entity34			0
@entity76 forces are more prevalent in @entity72 's southern hinterlands , while the better - funded , better - equipped @entity34 is primarily in control of the cities			1
the @entity25 have closed bars , attempted to ban smoking and forced women to wear veils in a bid to implement gender segregation			0
@entity159 , a multilingual art dealer from @entity110 who has spent considerable time in the @entity161 hawking the work of local @entity1 artisans , made a hurried departure well before the rebel takeover			1
he went from doing a roaring trade with @entity168 tourists to becoming an internal refugee in a matter of months			0
" i left before the rebels entered the city , " he said			2
" after hearing about their attacks in the ( far ) north , i knew they would come ( to @entity110 )			2
" he now lives in uncertainty in a town near @entity0			0
not all @entity15 back the cause of an independent @entity72			1
@entity180 ag @entity179 , a former rebel now living in @entity58 and part of the @entity1 government , said talks with the rebels were possible if it would accept the country 's territorial integrity			1
he said @entity34 and the @entity76 must accept " that tolerance of religious difference is non-negotiable , and the nation 's diversity must be preserved , " respectively			1
when asked whether he would he would be willing to take part in peace talks with either group , @entity179 instantly responded , " of course i would accept			0
" but he believes that the self - declared " @entity72 " is destined to unravel for two reasons : because the more nationalist @entity76 did not consult the local population before declaring independence , and because it would be impossible for @entity34 to enforce sharia law over the long term due to @entity1 's inherent diversity			1
@entity159 , the art dealer , says that the revolt was partly motivated by another important factor and that it would not be easily undone			0
" it is racism , plain and simple , " he said			0
" the @entity15 do not want to be ruled by @entity206 , @entity207 or @entity208 , " three of @entity1 's principal peoples			1
the reality driving this @entity15 revolt is more likely a complex hybrid of several factors , including ethnic nationalism , political isolation and a lack of economic opportunity			1
on top of that is the austere brand of @entity221 being espoused by @entity34			0
the military stalemate is compounded by political paralysis			2
@entity224 , the army captain who overthrew president @entity225 in march , had pledged to retake the embattled north			1
he has since technically stepped aside in favor of interim president @entity228			0
@entity228 , however , is in a @entity230 hotel after being beaten unconscious in a may 21 attack that occurred in the presidential palace			0
in @entity228 's absence , @entity1 is being effectively led by interim prime minister @entity234 , a former @entity235 engineer who holds @entity161 citizenship			1
@entity234 has hinted at trying to push the rebels back , and there are reports of troops being mobilized from southern garrisons to @entity116 , which could serve as a launch pad for a counterinsurgency campaign			2
but the town 's threadbare garrisons suggest the army and gendarmerie would be ill - prepared to take the offensive			2
only a handful of armored personal carriers and technical fighting trucks were evident			0
most soldiers and gendarmes buzz around town on motor scooters more suited to running errands than fighting a war			0
a magnet for jihadists for the @entity161 , the collapse of @entity1 poses multiple headaches beyond the humanitarian crisis that many have been striving to prevent			1
its counterterrorism program here is in abeyance , just as @entity268 , the @entity269 , and other freelance jihadists expand their presence			0
@entity268 has made millions of dollars through ransom payments for @entity168 hostages			0
this money is thought to have been spent on a more sophisticated arsenal that may , according to some @entity168 intelligence estimates , include ground - to - air missiles looted from @entity67 's arsenals			2
while specifics regarding this more sophisticated weaponry remains speculative for the time being due to a dearth of verifiable intelligence in the @entity72 region , what is known is that this sprawling , ungoverned area is becoming a magnet for regional and even transnational jihadists , according to several witnesses			0
basically , @entity1 remains in political freefall while quarrelsome rebels attempt to consolidate their control over an area the nearly the size of @entity296			1
after early efforts regarding a possible military intervention were rebuffed by @entity300 's junta , the @entity302 regional body @entity301 is taking the issue to the @entity304			1
@entity305 , the president of neighboring @entity4 -- a nation long plagued by its own @entity15 revolts -- has been sounding the alarm bell on the looming danger of jihadists controlling territory in @entity1			1
@entity312 , the chairman of the @entity313 , also plans to raise the @entity72 issue at the @entity304 in coming days			0
it 's a situation that the late guitarist @entity7 , whose album " talking @entity110 " won a @entity318 , would not recognize			2
" for some , @entity110 is a place at the end of nowhere , " he once said			0
" but that 's not true			2
i 'm from @entity110 , and i can tell you that it 's right in the center of the world			0
" opinion : @entity43 : the worst may be yet to come			0

the @entity302 nation of @entity1 has been in political limbo since a coup in march
the coup was over the government 's response to a @entity15 rebellion in the north
now , rebels and @entity62 militants are in control of several northern cities
there is concern that @entity1 could soon become a haven for terrorists
