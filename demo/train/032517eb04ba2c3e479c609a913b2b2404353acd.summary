-- using high - tech robotic cameras , a team of scientists is getting a rare first glimpse of marine life in the @entity6 that could shed light on the ocean 's ecosystem and climate to as far back as 1,000 years			1
images of tulip - shaped sponges , brightly colored corals , delicate pink stars and feathery organisms were among the breathtaking marine life beamed up by a submersible robot that scoured the ocean bed at a depth of some 9,800 feet [ 3,000 meters ] off the @entity6 coast of @entity21			1
the team , led by @entity23 , @entity24 and including scientists from three @entity24 universities and the @entity27 , is in the midst of a 20 - day expedition to study 11 areas under the protection of the @entity32			1
exploring these areas is important because they contain the " trees of the ocean , " said @entity37 , research scientist with the @entity38 of @entity24			1
she is among the lead scientists in the expedition			2
" it 's been really spectacular , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity40 from her office at the institute as pictures from the robot streamed on her computer			2
" it 's really changing our perception of the diversity that 's out there			2
... we 're seeing new species in deeper waters			0
" @entity37 told the @entity56 that scientists potentially can look at the coral 's chemical composition and determine the temperature of the water and other data from 1,000 years ago			1
" that 's how we are able to say if there is warming or a change in climate direction , " she said			2
" in order to understand the present , we need to put it into context			0
" corals have been a highly successful life form for 250 million years			0
they are tiny animals and polyps that exist as genetically identical individuals and can eat , defend themselves and kill plankton for food			0
in the process they also secrete calcium carbonate , which becomes the basis for an external skeleton on which they sit			0
these calcified deposits can grow to enormous sizes over a long period of time and form coral reefs			0
the reefs are among the world 's most productive ecosystems and can harbor more than 4,000 species of fish and many other marine life forms			1
some estimates have suggested 20 percent of the world 's coral reefs are already dead and an additional 24 percent are gravely threatened			0
in the week they have left in the expedition , @entity37 and her team hope to collect samples and video from the depths of the ocean to gain a new understanding of these corals as well as other marine life			1
the underwater robot , operated by crew aboard the @entity111 ship @entity112 , is enabling the crew to go about 500 meters deeper than they have before			0
@entity37 told @entity40 the research will also help them evaluate areas that are still too deep for current fishing technologies but could be accessible in years to come			1
" this will enable us to give advice in the future about what types of organisms are in these areas before they 're fished , " she said .			0

the scientists discovered deep - sea marine life that could shed light on the ocean 's climate
robotic cameras scoured the ocean bed at a depth of 9,800 feet off the @entity24 coast
the research will also help evaluate if the protected areas should be further *conserved*
