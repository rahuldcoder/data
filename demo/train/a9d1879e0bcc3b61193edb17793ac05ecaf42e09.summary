@entity1 's most renowned dishes , made rich by the heavy use of local herbs and spices , are traditionally eaten during the colorful @entity7 ceremonies that punctuate life on the @entity10 island			1
dining out is a relatively recent development in @entity1 -- a few generations ago people may have grabbed takeaway from warungs ( small shops and restaurants ) but generally did not go out to eat			1
these days though , plenty of classic dishes are served everywhere from tiny warungs through to high - end restaurants , making it easy for travelers to savor the flavors of real @entity26 cuisine			1
@entity27 ( suckling pig ) pork dishes are relatively hard to find across the mostly @entity10 archipelago , but @entity1 's famed suckling pig makes any roaming traveler 's wait worthwhile			1
while strictly speaking a suckling pig should still be feeding on its mother 's milk , in @entity1 the pigs used in this popular dish can weigh about 70 kilograms ( 150 pounds )			2
they are rubbed with turmeric then stuffed with a " base gede , " or spice paste , which usually includes a combination of coriander seeds , lemongrass , @entity47 lime leaves and salam leaves , chillies , black pepper , garlic , red shallots , ginger and kencur ( lesser galangal )			0
the pig is roasted on a spit over coconut husks or wood to tender perfection			2
when ordering a plate , expect sliced meat , a few pieces of satay , caramelized crackling and more obscure parts , like crispy intestines -- this is nose - to - tail dining at its most traditional			1
while warungs serve the dish right across the island , @entity67 's in @entity68 ( @entity70 / @entity69 no. 2 ) is the most renowned place to try it and is the choice of @entity1 - based @entity77 pastry chef @entity76 , of @entity78 and @entity79			1
" they do n't need the press , but i hate the haters , " he says			0
@entity84 , director of cuisine at @entity86 , suggests @entity87 in @entity88 ( @entity89 )			0
" the skin is served crispy and the meat is always tender -- they also offer a special that is served with rice and spicy soup which is delicious			2
" @entity97 @entity97 is a crunch - tender mix of vegetables , grated coconut meat and minced meat mixed with various heady herbs and spices , and often fresh blood -- every village has its own version			1
while it 's the usual accompaniment to babi guling , lawar can stand as a dish in its own right -- lawar nangka , or young jackfruit lawar , is an example			0
@entity113 and sarong chef @entity114 recommends the nasi lawar campur at @entity116 ( @entity117 , @entity118 )			0
" this place is always packed , " @entity114 says , adding that the variety of dishes accompanying the lawar are excellent			0
" the serapah sapi , which is a mixture of shredded vegetables , velvety offal , thick blood and coconut milk , is just a winner			1
do n't be off put by the inclusion of blood , it is a part of every meat dish adding flavor , freshness and texture			2
" @entity134 ( slow cooked duck ) another ceremonial dish , bebek betutu needs to be cooked for so long that you 'll have to order it a day in advance			0
chef @entity140 from @entity141 ( @entity142 , @entity142 , @entity143 ) explains that the duck is first rubbed with tamarind puree and salt to purify any " ducky " aromas and tenderize the meat			0
this is then washed off and the bird ( chicken is often used instead ) is stuffed with eggs , cassava leaves and bumbu rajeng , a spice mix specifically created for this dish			0
it 's then wrapped in " upeh " , or betel nut husks , and slow cooked until the meat falls off the bone			0
" there are variations , as upeh can be difficult to find and expensive at times -- banana leaves can also be used , " says @entity140			0
while @entity141 occasionally makes the chicken version , a good spot to sample the succulent duck dish is at @entity168 chef @entity167 's long - running @entity1 ( @entity169 , @entity170 )			1
sate lembat @entity1 's take on satay , the classic meat - on - a - stick dish found across the @entity10 archipelago , is minced meat pounded in a mortar and pestle with young grated coconut and a bumbu , or spice mixture , that varies according to region			1
it may be similar to the pastes used in babi guling or bebek betutu but perhaps with cardamom , cinnamon , nutmeg , tamarind or cumin seeds also making an appearance			0
the seasoned meat is shaped around a split bamboo skewer and quickly barbecued , often while hand - fanned , over hot coals			2
forget the peanut sauce found elsewhere , sate in @entity1 is accompanied with shrimp paste - based sambal " matah " , meaning raw or alive			1
sate is a popular street food dish so it can be found at any busy market , but a higher - end option is the @entity203 's @entity87 ( @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 ) , where the sate lilit ikan is served on aromatic lemongrass skewers			1
@entity211 ( grilled fish ) @entity213 - style while not a particularly authentic @entity26 dish , tucking into ikan bakar ( grilled fish ) seaside in @entity222 as the sun sets , toes flexing in the sand as candles flicker to life , is a quintessential @entity1 dining experience			1
@entity225 , chef @entity226 , suggests heading to @entity227 , reputed to be the very first ikan bakar warung in @entity213 , on the beach -- these days it can be found amid a cluster of warungs off @entity232			1
here nyoman @entity234 makes a superlative ikan bakar using kakap merah ( red snapper ) over wood charcoal with " the most amazing sauce which he refuses to give the recipe for , " @entity233 says			1
the basic ingredient of the special sauce is chillies , though it 's not spicy as it 's balanced with lots of tomato amid other fresh " secret " additions , he adds			0
be siap sambal matah ( chicken in ' raw ' sambal ) @entity250 from @entity251 ( @entity252 , @entity68 ) nominates be siap sambal matah as his favorite dish : it 's shredded chicken in a raw sambal of shallots , lemongrass , ginger torch , chillies , coconut oil , shrimp paste , salt and lime leaves			0
most warungs offering nasi campur ( rice with mixed dishes ) will have it among their dishes of the day , but @entity251 's restaurant manager 's mother makes the version he likes best for their staff meals			2
" i ca n't get enough of it ! it is a dish you wo n't find anywhere in @entity281 other than @entity1 and cooked properly it 's not to be missed , " he says			2
" people can always come and join our staff meal if they like			0
" @entity286 has been living and working in @entity287 since 1997and these days manages online regional guide @entity288 .			0

*originally* eaten only during @entity7 ceremonies , these @entity26 dishes can now be found in tiny local cafes and high - end restaurants
every village has its own version of @entity97 , a mix of vegetables , grated coconut meat , minced meat and fresh blood
tucking into ikan bakar ( grilled fish ) seaside in @entity222 is a quintessential @entity1 dining experience
