" the government and mayor of @entity5 have decided to end the current process to dispose of the @entity5 , " read a statement on the @entity19 's website			2
" the stadium will now be retained it ( sic ) as a public asset , and the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) has been asked to start a new process to secure tenants for the stadium			1
" the latest development also secures the future of the stadium as an athletics venue , with @entity5 bidding to host the 2017 @entity32			2
@entity3 originally won the right to move into the stadium in february , beating off competition from rival @entity5 club @entity36 , after their bid received the unanimous backing of the @entity25			1
but the decision has now been reversed amid concerns that a continued legal challenge from @entity36 could cause delays which would impact negatively on the future of the stadium			1
