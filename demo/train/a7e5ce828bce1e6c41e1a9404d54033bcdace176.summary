i was n't always in love with the idea of fitness or being healthy			2
but it 's something that became extremely important after losing one of my best friends , @entity5 , in december 2005 , and realizing that life was way too short to just be thrown away on junk food and little activity ; that was n't living			1
when @entity5 passed , i made a promise to him and myself that i would do everything in my power to keep his dreams of making a difference for people with different abilities in the world of fitness alive			2
i was n't quite sure how i was going to do it , but i knew that if i wanted to i would have to get myself in shape first and the rest would soon fall into place			1
in my freshman year at @entity27 , as i was looking through pictures posted on @entity25 , i began to see a person i did n't like , and i knew something needed to be done to change it			1
by the time i started my sophomore year and was acclimated with the campus , i had made a great deal of friends and was doing well in school , but something was missing			1
i was going to the gym about three times a week doing as much as i could on my own , but it was n't always easy to get in and out of machines or to know which exercises would be beneficial			2
i told my family what i was trying to do and they agreed to support me so i could work with a personal trainer			2
after meeting with a few different people , i met with @entity47			2
that 's when the transformation began			1
from my first meeting with @entity47 , i knew this was going to be successful			0
he had worked with people of the adaptive population before and had told me that anything was possible , as long i wanted it to be			0
about four months into our training , i came to @entity47 with what seemed to be a crazy idea : after watching athletes compete in hand cycles one weekend i wanted to complete a marathon			1
without hesitation , he said , " ok , let 's get to work then			2
" i finished my first hand - cycling marathon on december 4 , 2011 , with a time of 4:34:14			1
when i looked up at that clock , more exhausted than i have ever been , something inside of me said , " i have to do this again , but next time do it better			0
" that was the day my competitive spirit was brought to life			0
i competed in several races after that and loved every second of it , but i wanted to get stronger			0
this is when i first heard about @entity82			1
i walked into my first @entity82 box ( gym ) on may 3 , 2012			1
i saw people who had just finished a workout lying flat on their backs , breathing heavily , looking like they had just come out of a war zone			0
i thought to myself , " i want to do this and look like that someday			0
" that first day i spent close to an hour with @entity91 , owner of @entity92			0
we talked about everything from what i had done before , to what i thought i could do , to what i thought at the time was physically impossible			0
@entity5 accepted me for everything i was and together we took it workout by workout			0
six months into my experience , i saw undeniable changes			0
i was stronger , i was moving faster , and all i could seem to think or talk about was @entity82			1
it 's now been a year			1
i have worked with several different coaches and have had the opportunity to travel the country showing people how an adaptive athlete with @entity110 gets it done			0
if you would have told me that in a year i would be lifting weights over my head , flipping tires and coaching this sport , i would n't have believed you , but this is my reality			2
as an adaptive athlete and coach , i see and do things differently than most , but that does n't make my desire to be great any weaker			0
in @entity82 when the term " @entity125 " is used it means an athlete has done something as prescribed			1
my weights and rep scheme may never be @entity125 , but my effort always will be			0
if this last year has taught me anything , it 's to embrace every challenge that comes your way because you never know when that challenge is going to turn into great opportunity .			1

@entity139 began getting in shape after a friend 's death
