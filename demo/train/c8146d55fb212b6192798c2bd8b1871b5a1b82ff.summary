-- as we prepare to celebrate @entity2 on sunday , let us not forget that friday marks the second anniversary of the start of the @entity6 oil spill			1
it deserves more than a shrug , an " oh , yeah , " and " how 's the fishing ? " it deserves more than a solemn voiced announcer relegating it to a " this day in history , " with a picture from the archives to jog our memory			1
sometimes , a tragedy has its own tragedy : it has its day , or week , or month in the news cycle ; then time passes and other things happen			2
we move on , directed by the media and politicians , to the next great outrage			2
in so doing , we may lose the why and the wherefore -- the things that caused us , through the lens and the pen , to be interested , involved , invested in a tragedy not our own			2
and we then forget just what made us a community , if only for a moment			2
as @entity34 said : " my humanity is bound up in yours , for we can only be human together			1
" @entity37 , share with me , for a few minutes , the humanity of the @entity41			1
for i am a daughter of the @entity43 , and this is personal -- though , as is often the case , the personal is universal			2
when the @entity41 well exploded , 11 people died			2
not a lot of people , in the sense that they measure tragedies			0
but " every individual is a world			0
" eleven worlds exploded , and they had satellites -- spouses , children , siblings , parents , friends and neighbors -- still affected , still reeling out of orbit , still trying to cope with a void that can never be filled			0
we call the work we do " making a living			0
" if we lose a job , we can hopefully , eventually , find another			0
but if we lose a " living " -- a way of life -- what then ? the fishermen and their support network -- their satellites and dependents -- were crippled by the oil spill			1
yes , the seafood industry has begun to recover , but it still limps			0
tragedy affects our lives and our livelihoods			0
but it also affects our environment and the creatures that make it habitable , beautiful -- and profitable			0
two years ago , we cringed at the pictures of the oil - soaked pelicans , the turtles and fish drowned in oil ; we were repulsed by the images of wetlands and marshes greasy , with slimeballs surfacing			1
do we know the status of the fauna and flora today ? and we cheered the rescue efforts , we donated , we educated ourselves about ecosystems and coastal waterways and environmental interconnectedness			0
do we have a minute on this anniversary to continue our education , to donate again to our ecological survival ? i felt anger two years ago , as oil spewed into my beloved @entity43			1
i was so angry , and words seemed as helpless as the birds and the marshes			0
why do n't they do something ? when the governor and the local politicians railed and ranted and demanded and got their airtime , i 'll be honest : i cheered			0
i felt righteous indignation vicariously justified			0
nor was the anger misplaced			0
the deepwater horizon oil spill was n't an unavoidable accident			1
it resulted from negligence and avarice			0
profit first , responsibility second			0
i am reminded of what @entity125 once said : " when morality comes up against profit , it is seldom that profit loses			0
" but there is profit , and there is profit , and there are moral lessons in every tragedy -- practical lessons that bring us from the personal to the universal			1
over the past two years , i have reflected , off and on , about dismay and anger and lessons , and i think i 've discovered three in the @entity41			1
first , only @entity144 has the resources to clean up its own mess			1
the federal government had neither the technicians nor the knowledge to stop the oil from gushing into the @entity43 and sliming our shores , the barrier islands , marine life , our way of life and food supply			1
second , and as a consequence , the philosophy that government should stay out of the way of @entity144 primes the pump of disaster			1
i do n't want @entity164 in my life any more than the most fervent tea party @entity166 does			0
but , brother patriot , let me tell you a fact of life : we need the federal government to act as umpire			1
only @entity144 government is big enough to keep @entity144 from thumbing its nose at the public welfare , and besmirching the public 's health and safety			1
there 's a reason the @entity182 begins , " @entity183 in order to ... promote the common welfare ... " third , there 's something wrong with the philosophy that almost any regulation is overregulation			1
no , we should have done something before the spill			2
we should have regulated @entity6 and watched it closely , instead of giving it a pass to do as it pleased			1
to modify a @entity196 © , an ounce of regulation is worth many pounds of rectification			2
but in remembering this event , let us never lose sight that we 're all in this together			0
and when disaster strikes -- natural or man - made -- we must find the will to rebuild safer and stronger than before			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity206 : *observances* of @entity2 and the second year since @entity6 oil spill are upon us
as spill fades in memory , she says , we must remember why it drew out our shared humanity
she says 3 lessons *emerged* : one , only @entity144 has means to clean up own mess
@entity206 : government staying out of way leads to disaster ; any regulation is not overregulation
