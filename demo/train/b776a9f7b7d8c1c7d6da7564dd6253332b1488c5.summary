-- it was speculative before given the lack of independent confirmation , but now apparently @entity4 has gone on record to confirm that the original deal signed with @entity7 for @entity9 exclusivity back in 2007 was a five - year deal			1
that means at least some legal hoops would need jumping through if we 're ever going to see that oft - rumored @entity9 before 2012			2
@entity13 reports that court documents filed by @entity4 in a @entity16 class - action suit confirm the original @entity7 exclusivity deal had a five - year duration			1
the suit , ongoing since 2007 , claims that @entity4 and @entity7 were exerting a monopoly over @entity9 service by surreptitiously locking @entity9 buyers into renewing contracts with @entity7 once their initial two years was up			1
on the flip side , there are a number of reasons such a contract might be amended or canceled , so it 's not exactly a total given that the @entity9 wo n't appear on another carrier before 2012			2
but given the original terms , it could require some tricky negotiation or legal fancy footwork to get there			0
moreover , the class - action suit also alleges an illegal monopoly over the @entity39 , which the court ruled substantial enough to move forward			0
on both fronts then -- consumer market and legal proceedings -- it will be fascinating to watch for further details on when the @entity47 exclusivity curtain might drop or even be forcibly struck down			0
do you think we 'll see the @entity9 come to another carrier before 2012 ? Â© 2010 @entity0			0
