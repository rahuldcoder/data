-- when the holidays bring heartache instead of joy , i think they do so because they stand as an unforgiving yardstick against which we measure our losses and troubles			1
if no one reminds us , we can sometimes overlook the fact that loved ones are gone , or that our lives are filled with painful conflict in exactly the intimate areas that should be sources of strength and comfort for us			2
but then along come the holidays , imposing upon us once again a template for what happiness and interpersonal success is expected to look like			1
it can be hard to measure up			2
it is far easier to overlook the death of loved ones when you do n't have to stare across the holiday table at their empty places			0
it is far easier to pretend that family trauma or conflict do n't exist when you are far away and on your own			1
but the holidays force us to either return to painful family interactions or to fully own our isolation and spend the season alone			1
it is a terrible choice			0
i 've treated many patients over the years who reliably became depressed during the holidays out of dread of having to interact with their families			1
on the other hand , the silence of @entity50 morning on one 's own carries its own unique pain			0
i never cease to be amazed at how often both emotional well - being and mental illness hinge on how we negotiate these types of impossible choices			0
because the choices really are often insoluble and the losses are often so actual , we in the mental health professions frequently try to find " a third way " to help people cope			1
in the end , these " third way " approaches usually come down to helping people reframe their issues so they that seem less hopeless and painful			1
or we provide people with medications such as antidepressants to make their brains and bodies less reactive to stress			1
reframing i 've given many interviews over the years regarding strategies for helping people cope emotionally with the holidays			1
for people truly overwhelmed , i often recommend exploring ways to neutralize @entity50 negativity by changing how they approach the holidays			1
for example , if someone develops a major depression every year before or after going home to see her family , i encourage her to explore what would happen if she abandoned this painful pattern and instead proactively planned a @entity50 vacation somewhere beyond the reach of her memories and holiday associations that generate symptoms of depression			2
sometimes this type of strategy works beautifully			0
often other family members are equally miserable and join the exodus , providing strength in numbers			2
sometimes the person 's absence leads the family to re-evaluate itself and change in positive ways			2
but sometimes , the attempt to flee @entity50 is met with such anger and guilt production from the family that the patient actually ends up doing worse			2
everyone 's holiday situation is unique			0
this type of approach toward reframing @entity50 follows what i sometimes call the " who says " rule			2
many times we torture ourselves with ideas of how things should be , or would be if we were somehow smarter , richer , different			0
to which i often ask , " who says ? " " who says things have to be the way you think they should be ? " " who says you have to suffer over a painful fantasy of what you think @entity50 ought to be ? " we cling tightly to our fantasies -- good and bad			0
but sometimes when we can loosen their grip on us , we can see new possibilities for how to be at peace with our lives and find a little joy			0
medications this holiday season i 've been thinking a lot about christmas 1987 , because it was four days later , on december 29 , that fluoxetine , better known by its brand name @entity147 , received @entity149 approval for use in the @entity151			1
the approval of @entity147 launched one of history 's greatest run of " third way " approaches to trauma and loss			1
with @entity147 came a growing belief that medicines might hold promise as the ultimate solution , not just to clinical depression , but perhaps to heartache more generally			1
having once believed this myself , i find that now , 25 years later , i am far more cautious in my appraisal of what the coming of @entity147 actually meant for the world 's emotional well - being			1
i 've seen repeatedly with my own eyes how modern antidepressants like @entity147 can help depressed people get their lives back			1
and i 've seen people who had struggled with negative thoughts and feelings for years find that they were different -- and more successful -- with the addition of an antidepressant in their lives			1
but in the last several years it has become increasingly clear that antidepressants are not , and probably will never be , a cure - all for heartache , in any of its forms clinical or mundane			0
for one thing , our best current data suggest that antidepressants only work adequately for 40 % to 60 % of depressed people , with the percentages varying depending on what one thinks of as " adequate			1
" more recent evidence suggests that antidepressants can actually worsen depressive symptoms in a sizable minority of people who take them			2
perhaps this should n't surprise us			0
chemotherapeutic agents that increase the probability of surviving cancer also increase the risk of developing a second cancer in the future			0
and yet despite this fact , and despite the dread we feel at the mere mention of the word " chemotherapy , " most of us embrace chemotherapeutic treatment when diagnosed with cancer , understanding that despite the manifold limitations and horrendous side effects , it 's the best that we 've got			2
perhaps the most concerning recent debate in the antidepressant literature revolves around the question of whether taking these medications increases the risk of having a depression relapse when the antidepressant is discontinued			0
this issue is complex and hotly debated			0
but if the weight of the evidence eventually suggests that antidepressants carry this risk it will further complicate the clinician 's task			0
still , as with chemotherapy , they 're the best that we 've got			0
finding more solutions this year , with @entity50 upon us , i am more convinced than ever that we who work clinically or conduct research in the realm of mental health must redouble our efforts to find new and better " third ways " to help deal , not just with clinical depression , but also with the ubiquitous heartache and anxiety that are so prevalent in the modern world			0
although i personally research biological approaches to treating depression , i suspect that part of our movement forward will come from better integrating older ways of wisdom into our treatment protocols			0
many wisdom traditions point toward the same thing -- that full healing requires not just reframing or biology , but an inner transformation that embraces suffering itself as a means of escape from our suffering			1
