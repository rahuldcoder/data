-- @entity1 is getting bigger and bigger and bigger -- one volcanic blast at a time			1
the growth so far -- compared to the size of the @entity8 nation 's main @entity6 island or the vast continent of @entity8 -- is minuscule , about 200 meters ( 650 feet ) long by about 50 meters wide			1
that 's small enough that , if the volcanic activity stops , the newly created island could wash back into the sea in months			1
but if it keeps going , it could enlarge even more and stick around for the long haul , expanding @entity1 's footprint in the process			1
" a lot of it depends on how fast it erodes , " said @entity18 , a @entity19 professor and expert in deep submarine volcanism			1
" until it shuts off , it 's too soon to tell			2
" even it slips away , and even if such volcanoes poke up from the sea floor like this every few years , what 's happened so far is exciting for volcanologists			1
and video of the steady eruption -- a stream of white smoke , interrupted by occasional blasts of blackish material -- is powerful imagery of what 's unfolding , even if what 's emitted does n't spew anywhere as high into the sky as land - based volcanoes like @entity44 or @entity45			1
unlike these deadly examples , this @entity47 volcano started its eruption -- on wednesday , according to the @entity50 , at the least -- in shallows off the small , remote island of @entity53 , hundreds of miles over sea due south of @entity55			1
the national agency since issued a warning for those around the island crater			2
the most common type of volcano , by far , are those that erupt and spew material underwater : @entity18 estimates " probably more than 80 % happen in the oceans , and we never know about them			2
" volcanoes that erupt on land get the most attention , for good reason , given their impact on people , vegetation and ( by virtue of their expansive eruptions into the atmosphere ) on things like air traffic patterns and climate			0
what 's happening near these isolated @entity1 islands is more of a sea - land hybrid			1
it is rooted on the flank of a string of underwater volcanoes a few hundred feet from the main island , @entity18 explained			2
what 's being expelled into the air -- a mixture of water that appears as whitish , fluffy steam and darker coarse rock fragments -- is distinct from the magma , he adds			0
" in the shallow sea water , ... it causes it to behave explosively , " @entity18 said			0
" it 's kind of a short - term thing			0
if it kept growing , it would act differently			0
" by " differently , " he means acting like a more traditional land volcano with the crater well out of the water			0
whether or not that happens , people should be able to safely set foot on the island " pretty soon after it stops erupting , " @entity18 notes -- assuming experts are 100 % sure it wo n't blow again			0
if it 's feasible , say , a year from now , remains to be seen			0
there was a similar case two years off the @entity115 in 2011 where there was no breakthrough , and thus no new island			0
two years earlier , a new island did emerge in such circumstances near the @entity47 island of @entity122 -- as happened in 1963 with @entity123 , an island that built up over four years in the 1960s off @entity125 .			0

a volcanic eruption hundreds of miles south of @entity55 forms a new island
video shows white smoke mixed with black material , *including* rocks
" it 's too soon to tell " if the island will grow or erode into the sea , expert says
