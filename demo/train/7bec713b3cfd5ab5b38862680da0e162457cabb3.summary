-- a mandatory evacuation was issued saturday for a southwestern @entity3 town threatened by the rain - swollen @entity4 , an order that was issued as the @entity6 weighed whether to blow up a levee and flood rural farm communities to save the town			1
heavy rains have pushed the river to near - record levels , putting pressure on a tributary system that began buckling days earlier when a levee failed and flooded a handful of rural towns in southeastern @entity18			1
" i know that the price being paid is high , " said maj. gen. @entity19 of the @entity6 , who told reporters during a briefing that he had flown over a number of the affected communities			1
with more rain predicted and the deterioration of a levee near @entity28 , @entity3 , the town 's mayor , @entity29 , ordered his 2,800 residents to leave by midnight			1
@entity32 told reporters that a decision whether to blow a 2 - mile hole in the levee to save @entity28 will be dictated by the conditions			1
" the decision clock has been rolling , " he said			0
but the decision whether to blow up the levee has pitted @entity3 and @entity18 against one another in recent days , with @entity18 filing a federal lawsuit to block the @entity6			1
@entity3 joined the @entity6 as a defendant			1
a federal judge ruled friday against @entity18 , saying a 1928 law permitted the breach of a levee to ease pressure on the river			1
caught in the middle , though , are residents on either side of the river , which threatens to swallow communities in @entity18 and @entity3			1
" people are losing their jobs			0
they 're losing their homes			0
they are losing the beds they sleep in at night			0
all because of this flooding , " said @entity61 , 48 , who worries breaching the levee could overwhelm smaller tributaries that could flood his home			2
@entity61 is also concerned about where the water released under the @entity6 ' plan would go since much of the land in the area is already under water because of heavy rains			2
" where is all that water going to go ? " he said			0
the plan calls for engineers to use explosives to breach the @entity78 levee , flooding 130,000 acres of @entity18 farmland that has been designated as a flood plain			2
about 90 families who live in the area have already been evacuated , @entity18 officials have said			0
@entity3 and @entity18 have called out hundreds of @entity86 soldiers to help evacuate communities and protect vacated communities			2
but while government officials were divided by the decision to breach the levee , residents on both sides of the river appeared to be pulling together			1
families forced to flee were being offered shelter in area hotels and at local churches , according to county officials			0
a car dealership in @entity101 , @entity18 , was allowing residents forced to leave their homes to store furniture and other personal belongings in buildings on their lot , while some restaurants in the area were providing food to the displaced			2
" everybody is pulling together , " @entity61 said			0
while @entity32 said a final decision has not been made to breach the @entity78 levee , he has begun preparations by ordering barges that would be used in the operation to move toward the levee			2
engineers have reported sand boils and seepage at a number of levees near the confluence of the @entity125 and @entity4 rivers , a condition that @entity32 said also threatens the integrity of the @entity4 and @entity128 -- the world 's largest flood control project			0
" there is water in places where we have never ever seen it before , " @entity32 said			0
engineers have warned that should the rising waters of the @entity4 overwhelm the entire flood control project , it could deluge cities , destroy crops , destroy businesses and paralyze river transportation .			0
