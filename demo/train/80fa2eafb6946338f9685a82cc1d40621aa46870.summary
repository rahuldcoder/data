this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity15 , @entity16 : we 're wrapping up the first week of november , and we 're glad to have you along for the ride			2
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity21			1
first up : @entity22 @entity23 : " a horrific outburst of violence			2
" that is how president @entity27 described yesterday 's deadly shooting at a military post in @entity5			1

according to military officials , the alleged gunman is in custody			1

health care debate @entity23 : back in the nation 's capital , the debate over health care reform is ratcheting up			1
the @entity57 might vote on its health care bill this weekend			1
and yesterday , that bill , which has been backed primarily by @entity60 , picked up the support of two big groups : @entity63 and the @entity64			2
@entity63 is the country 's largest organization of older @entity66			2
the group 's head says the house bill meets @entity63 's goals when it comes to health care reform			1
the @entity64 , or @entity64 , is one of the nation 's most influential medical groups			2
it said the bill does n't represent its views perfectly , but it 's close enough to earn the @entity64 's support			2
many people , including most @entity81 , are opposed to the $ 1.1 trillion bill			2
yesterday , they held a rally at the @entity84 to speak out against it			1
one of their main criticisms is that the public option that 's included in the bill is basically a government takeover of the country 's health care system			1
@entity93 have offered their own proposals , but they 've been rejected by @entity60 , who are in the majority in the @entity57			1
yesterday , leaders from both parties spoke out against each other 's plans			1
@entity102 @entity101 , ( r ) @entity103 : this weekend , the @entity57 is likely to vote on pelosi - care			1
this bill is the greatest threat to freedom that i have seen in the 19 years i have been here in @entity110			1
taking away your freedom to choose your doctor			2
@entity114 , ( @entity115 ) house speaker : anything you need to know about the difference between the @entity120 bill and the @entity93 bill is that the @entity81 do not end health insurance companies ' discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions			1
that 's scandalous , the fact that it exists			0
i do n't understand why we have not heard the @entity66 people who have said that pre-existing conditions should not be a source of discrimination			0
benefits extended @entity23 : the @entity57 has passed a couple of economic measures that could help out two groups of people : the unemployed and first - time home buyers			1
the first part of this legislation extends the amount of time that people can collect unemployment benefits , something that millions of @entity66 are depending on right now			0
in all states , people who are out of a job could continue getting unemployment for an additional 14 weeks			0
but in states with an unemployment rate higher than 8.5 percent , the benefits would be extended for 20 weeks			0
the second measure is also an extension			0
this one is for an $ 8,000 tax credit that 's available to people buying a home for the first time			0
the @entity162 passed this legislation on wednesday , and president @entity27 is expected to sign it into law today			0
@entity166 @entity23 : yesterday , he took part in a @entity170 conference with @entity172 leaders			0
during his speech , the president said that the @entity84 government was guilty of mistreating native americans in the past , but he wants to build a new relationship between tribal leaders and the government			1
in order to do that , he 's ordered federal agencies to offer ideas on how @entity172 tribes can take part in government decisions			0
there are 564 federally recognized tribes in the @entity84 about two - thirds of them were represented at yesterday 's conference			1
@entity191 @entity192 , @entity16 : time for the shoutout ! who is the current secretary - general of the @entity196 ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity203 , b ) @entity204 , c ) ban ki - moon or @entity115 ) @entity202 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! ban ki - moon became the 8th @entity196 secretary - general on january 1 , 2007			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! safety assessment @entity23 : last week , @entity206 said that the @entity196 is determined to carry out its mission of helping the people of @entity7 build a better future			1
the statement came after an attack in the @entity218 country which claimed the lives of five @entity196 workers			1
the @entity196 is making some changes to its security measures in @entity7			1
( begin video ) @entity225 , @entity226 correspondent : after the targeted attack on @entity196 staff members here in a guarded guest house in @entity6 that left five @entity196 members dead , the @entity196 has decided to make some changes			1
they are , for right now , sending out about 600 foreign workers here , and they 're going to assess right now the security situation for their staff			1
they 're sending those workers out for about three weeks , and then intend to bring some of them back			0
but first , they want to figure out how to beef up security here			2
now , we understand though that the @entity196 is very , very adamant that they are not pulling out of @entity7			1
they are simply looking at the security situation , obviously , after that traumatic time where five of their colleagues died			2
we should also mention that @entity196 @entity248 ban ki - moon is asking for about $ 85 million to beef up security here			1
@entity223 , @entity50 , @entity6			0
( @entity250 ) military vaccines @entity23 : some @entity84 forces serving in @entity7 and @entity253 may be getting their h1n1 flu shots soon			1
just like with civilians , the military has a priority list that says who should get the vaccine first			1
but as @entity261 explains , there are some hang - ups in getting the doses out , even to the people at the top of that list			2
( begin video ) @entity268 , @entity50 pentagon correspondent : as @entity66 wait in lines across the country to get the @entity273 vaccine , the @entity269 this week finally began shipping limited vaccine supplies to troops fighting in @entity7 and @entity253			1
under @entity269 guidelines , tens of thousands of troops on the front line and those headed to war are the top military priority to receive the vaccine			1
even so , supplies are severely limited			0
only half of what is needed is now on the way			0
@entity287 , pentagon spokesman : right now , we do n't have enough to even take care of all of them			2
@entity291 : the @entity269 is defending plans to offer the vaccine to detainees at @entity295 , as well as those in @entity253 and @entity7			1
prisoners are considered to be high risk , but a lower military priority than troops , health care workers and civilian personnel			1
@entity291 ( @entity303 ) : i have n't heard an assurance that detainees will get it after civilians in this country			0
@entity310 : @entity261 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , you are presuming that i have the knowledge or the wherewithal to tell you the protocols that are being used for the general population			2
all i can do is speak to what the priorities are in this department			0
@entity291 : troops at home also a priority because they will be called upon to help in towns across the country if the crisis grows			0
the military 's top homeland defense commander has teams that could move into action			2
gen. @entity332 , commander , @entity334 : it would be to provide things like potentially logistics , movement of supplies , maybe additional health care providers that could assist in immunization			1
@entity291 : the @entity269 stopped counting the number of troops that have come down with @entity273 back in july , when world health authorities declared a global pandemic			1
but privately military officials say the number of cases continues to grow , and recently , defense secretary @entity349 received his vaccine			1
