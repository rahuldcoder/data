-- @entity1 is full of surprises			2
a few weeks ago , he announced that his first new album in 10 years was imminent			1
though " @entity6 " was n't due to hit stores until tuesday , march 12 , the album is currently streaming on @entity7 in its entirety			1
the official @entity0 review of @entity1 's @entity6 is below , and a version of it will be appearing in the magazine on newsstands next friday , march 8			1
early in his career , @entity1 realized that reinvention came naturally to him , and soon the spirit of change became his prime persona			0
through all of his alternate guises — space alien , drugged - out cartoon , machine - obsessed private detective , guy who just discovered the @entity24 — he 's maintained a spectacularly consistent inconsistency , and while not all of it has worked , at least we always knew that another character was following right behind			0
for the last decade , however , his chief guise has been @entity31			0
following turn - of - the - last - century releases @entity32 ( which found him reuniting with classic - era producer @entity33 ) , he suddenly disappeared , cutting short a tour , ignoring music , and making only occasional appearances amidst rumors of failing health so persistent that the @entity39 recorded a song called " is @entity41 ? " in the meantime , pop stars like @entity43 and @entity44 got rich crafting their own evil twins and countless bands co-opted @entity1 's fashionable bohemian androgyny			1
25 albums we ca n't wait to hear now he 's returned to look back at a lifetime of looking forward			2
" @entity6 , " his 26th album , finds @entity1 very much alive and vacillating between forward - looking restlessness and outright nostalgia			1
day takes the idea of returning to past experiments and exposes them to gamma radiation , speeding up the evolution process across 14 tracks			0
and like a judicious parent , he treats his most high - profile projects equally , paying homage to all their quirks and foibles : the album - opening title track sounds like a return to @entity70 , single " where are we now ? " wallows in low - era melancholy , and " @entity77 " is a gospel - glam strut in the spirit of @entity74 's " @entity73			0
" @entity33 drops in a bevy of sonic retrospective winks , making it easy to spot references and also to re-edit : if you dig the end - of - the - world dirges from @entity85 , you 'll adore " you feel so lonely you could die , " but if you never got over @entity87 's psychedelic folk , you can jettison all but " i 'd @entity88 " from @entity7			1
@entity1 drops new single , announces first album in ten years a few tracks lack clear antecedents ( see : the @entity93 - aping " @entity97 " ) , and some simply lack cohesion , or at least enough melody to anchor them			1
but @entity98 is also an excellent reminder that @entity101 , the @entity102 , and the lunatic who sang @entity105 songs with @entity106 have all been coexisting in the same brain for decades			0
now that all of his alter - egos have settled down , he can finally get on with the business of being @entity1 — auteur , bon vivant , and eternally , rock 's most gorgeous space alien			2
b best tracks " @entity116 " a hooky , paranoid rocker " @entity119 " a fuzzy glam - rock redux see the original article at @entity0			0
