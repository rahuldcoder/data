@entity0 , @entity1 -- a federal judge has temporarily blocked a controversial @entity1 law requiring all welfare applicants to be drug - tested			1
@entity7 district court judge @entity6 issued a temporary injunction monday evening against enforcement of the law 's " suspicionless drug testing " of adults seeking federal welfare			1
the law went into effect july 1 , but a single father and the @entity17 contend in a lawsuit that the new law is unconstitutional and violates @entity21 protection against unreasonable search and seizure			1
" perhaps no greater public interest exists than protecting a citizen 's rights under the @entity30 , " the judge wrote , quoting a 1997 @entity26 case			0
under the law , the @entity1 @entity31 requires the drug tests of adults applying to the federal @entity36 program			1
the aid recipients are responsible for the cost of the screening , which they recoup in their assistance if they qualify			0
those who fail the required drug testing may designate another individual to receive the benefits on behalf of their children , but they do not receive a refund for cost of the test			2
@entity1 gov. @entity49 has championed the law , saying it provides " personal accountability			1
" he added it was " unfair for @entity1 taxpayers to subsidize drug addiction			2
" @entity1 is not the first state to pass such legislation			2
@entity58 passed a similar law that was found to be unconstitutional by the 6th @entity7 @entity60 in 2003 for violating the @entity21			2
the @entity17 filed a class - action suit on behalf of an @entity0 single father who opposed the drug test			1
@entity64 , an unemployed adult college student who cares for a 4 - year - old son and disabled mother , was denied temporary cash assistance because he refused to be drug tested			0
the @entity70 veteran , an undergraduate at the @entity71 , contends the law violates his rights and adds he has never used illegal drugs			0
the judge , sitting in @entity0 , agreed to halt the drug testing until the @entity17 lawsuit is settled			1
but the judge denied the plaintiff 's request to make the matter a class - action case			0
" i 'm delighted for our client and delighted to have confirmation that all of us remain protected from unreasonable , suspicionless government searches and seizures , " said @entity1 @entity17 attorney @entity82 in a written statement			1
the @entity90 - controlled legislature passed the bill , and @entity49 signed it into law in may 2011			0
" the governor obviously disagrees with the decision and he will evaluate his options regarding when to appeal , " said his deputy press secretary @entity93			0
since campaigning for governor , @entity49 has said that the drug - testing of welfare recipients " will help to prevent misuse of @entity1 tax dollars " and make sure the money goes to the children			1
" research shows higher drug use among individuals receiving government assistance , and drug abuse also forces children into welfare assistance , " @entity49 said while signing the bill into law			2
the @entity17 said the state 's own study found that of the 2,000 people who took the state drug test , only a small percentage tested positive			2
" it shows that a little bit more than 2 % of the welfare applicants tested positive for drugs where it 's about 8Â½ % in the general public , " said @entity118 , executive director of the @entity17 of @entity1			1
@entity125 , the governor 's press secretary , said the study is flawed			0
" it does n't take in the deterrent effect , " @entity125 said			0
@entity125 added there 's no way to factor how many people avoided taking the test fearing they would test positive for drugs			0
after being approved for temporary cash assistance , @entity64 was shocked by the mandatory drug test			1
he then contacted the @entity17			0
" this is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy , that you ca n't condition getting some benefit from the government by surrendering your constitutional rights , " @entity118 said			0
attorneys for the state say pre-employment drug testing is commonplace and that the @entity70 vet himself could have been subjected to random drug testing while in the military			0
the governor 's office said it is confident the judge ultimately will uphold the constitutionality of the law , contending it 's popular among the people of @entity1			1
but judge @entity6 said in her ruling that based on the evidence , " there is a substantial likelihood " that @entity1 's law could be found unconstitutional			1
added the @entity17 's @entity118 : " we 're the only state in the country that has this ( law )			2
" @entity2 's @entity167 contributed to this report .			0
