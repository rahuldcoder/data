-- for the past few days , the @entity2 punditry here has been remarkably divided on predictions for @entity5			0
for every expert espousing @entity9 ' depth and balance there is another waxing rhapsodic about the @entity12 ' " momentum " and " destiny			1
" @entity14 echoed this ambivalence , as the gambling line continues to shift			0
we 'll let others divine the game 's outcome			1
but as you prepare to watch the highest - rated @entity23 in history , here are some factors to bear in mind			1
be careful not to exaggerate the importance of defense which team had the worst total defense in the @entity2 this past season ? the @entity32 , who also had the league 's best record , 15 - 1			1
the @entity9 ranked 31 of 32 teams on defense			2
the @entity12 ranked 27th , not much better			1
huh ? is n't defense a prerequisite for success ? does n't " defense win championships ? " not really			1
among almost 10,000 regular season @entity2 games , the better defensive team has won 66.5 % of the time , compared with 67.4 % of the time for the better offensive team			0
you need a good offense or a good defenseâ € ” and if you have both , great			0
so , if defense is no more critical to winning than offense is , why does everyone from @entity53 coaches to @entity55 analysts extoll its importance ? well , no one needs to talk up the virtues of scoring			1
no one needs to create incentives for players to score more touchdowns			0
there 's a reason why fans exhort " de-fense , de-fense ! " not " o - ffense , o - ffense ! " offense is fun			2
who gets the @entity74 shoe contracts and the other endorsements , the players who score or the defensive stoppers ? quick , which of the following set of names is more recognizable ? the top five touchdown leaders in @entity2 history : @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity86 - @entity85 , @entity87 , @entity88 ? or the top five interception leaders : @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , and @entity94 ? offense leads to glory and fame and money			0
we do n't need to provide incentive for players to score			2
we need to incentivize them to partake in the activity that does n't necessarily lead to endorsement deals			2
what better to do it than by telling players it 's indispensable for winning a championship ? consider the home field advantage as in all sports , in the @entity2 the home team wins most of the time , 57 % of games to be precise			1
( in only one anomalous year , 1968 , did home teams win less than half the games , but that was because there were five ties that season ; remove those five tied games and the home field advantage would have been 51 %			1
) this year the game is being played at @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity126			1
when the @entity128 lost their quarterback , @entity129 , to an injury and posted a miserable 2 - 14 record this year , it meant that , technically , there would be no " home team " for @entity5			2
but tell that to the fans			0
sunday 's game features another @entity129 as quarterback : @entity138 , who , of course , pilots the @entity12 ' offense			1
@entity129 will be on hand supporting his younger brother			0
and the fans will take their cue from him			0
what 's more , the opposing @entity9 also happen to be the @entity128 ' chief rival , the team the @entity125 fans dislike the most			1
for the @entity9 , playing in @entity124 will be akin to the @entity151 playing a @entity153 game in @entity154			2
for the @entity12 , it will be considerably more hospitable			1
do n't get overheated about the @entity12 ' hot streak after a dismal first half of the season , triggering murmurs that head coach @entity160 was about to be fired , the @entity12 suddenly upgraded their play and slipped into the playoffs with a 9 - 7 record			1
the team has won five straight games and the conventional wisdom is that they are on a " hot streak , " that " momentum is on their side			1
" while the team is , undeniably , streaking , that is something different from " momentum			2
" momentum implies predictive value			2
but there 's little evidence that winning a football game predicts how the team will play in the next game			1
a good team is a good team , and will win most of the time			0
a poor team is a poor team , and will lose most of time			0
you can liken this to coin - flipping			0
flip a coin 100 times and you will get 50 heads and 50 tails , or thereabouts			0
but it does n't mean you 'll alternate heads and tails			0
you may get a run of five heads , then a run of six tails			0
it does n't mean there 's momentum in coin - flipping			1
investors in financial markets , similarly , get duped into " chasing returns " of fund managers			0
one successful quarter does n't necessarily predict future success			0
the @entity12 may prevail on sunday			1
but if they do it will be because they are the better team , not because of what 's happened in their last few games			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			2

@entity221 offers a few *suggestions* for things to pay attention to in the @entity23
he says do n't exaggerate the *vaunted* importance of defense ; it 's not prerequisite for winning
he says the game in @entity125 carries a home field advantage via a rivalry and *favorite* son
@entity221 : the @entity12 may be in a " hot streak , " but that 's not the same as momentum
