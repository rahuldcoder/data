-- i knew there had to be a reason my family and i went through tough days together			1
i did n't understand why then , but the past couple of weeks have put so much into perspective			2
the lonely days of pacing around my kitchen seemed like some of the longest days of my life			2
if anyone had told me then that i would be wearing a crown , an evening gown , heels and a swimsuit in front of a live audience with bright lights and television cameras hovering around , i 'd have been the first one to dismiss it			2
i realize now that even my toughest days pale in comparison to the toughest days of others living with an autism spectrum disorder			1
i 've been given this opportunity to use my voice for those who do n't have one or have yet to find theirs			2
my path may not be one that another person would choose , but i challenged myself to enter the @entity32 competition because it seemed like the peak to my own personal @entity35			1
it also seemed kind of ironic : a girl who was told she was different and considered an outcast by many , in the nation 's biggest beauty pageant			1
i knew i would face challenges and even some skepticism , but i never expected the outpouring of support that continues to come in			0
winning the @entity45 during the competition was the highest honor for me			1
the fact that so many people , to whom i am a total stranger , took the time to elect me as their contestant of choice is something i am still trying to comprehend			0
the glitz and the glamour may have faded from the wonderful experience of @entity32 , but my commitment to raising awareness about autism and building bridges of acceptance grows stronger each day -- especially after i read e-mails , @entity64 posts or tweets from the people who have supported my journey			1
i will be successful if just one person encounters a child who is overstimulated without staring , if one teenager invites an " outcast " to lunch or just smiles at him or her , or if one employer gives a job to someone who might not be able to look the interviewer in the eye			0
i also hope that families reading my story who feel isolated or have concerns and questions about their children know they are not alone -- there is a wonderfully loving community with people just waiting to be your friend and mentor			0
one thing i have learned in partnering with organizations like @entity92 and @entity93 is that the special needs community is one of the most loyal and supportive groups anyone could join			0
i 'm honored to be a part of this new circle of friends , and have no doubt that it was the people who found me relatable and believed in me that helped me become @entity104			0
i do n't know what tomorrow will bring , but i do know there is a lot for me to do to make sure people really get that " @entity109 is just a dryer setting			0
