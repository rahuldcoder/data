-- for most of its roughly two - year existence , @entity1 has trapped its bounty inside mobile apps			1
more recently , though , the photo - sharing service has made chunks of its service available to desktop users			1
first you could view a page for individual photos from any browser , and in november it added profile pages that displayed all of a user 's images			0
as of tuesday , you finally see a working version of your @entity1 feed online			2
login at @entity19 and you 'll get a replica of your @entity1 home screen with photos from everyone you follow unfurling as you scroll down the browser window			0
there are no extra bells or whistles here , but you can double click to " like " an image , leave comments and follow or unfollow people			0
unfortunately , the web version is still missing the most important @entity1 feature : the ability to upload photos			1
the company has always put mobile first			0
the photos shared on the app are meant to be taken with the built - in cameras on mobile devices and their low resolution a perfect match for @entity1 's grainy film filters			1
as the @entity48 - owned service becomes more popular , there will be demand to access it from more devices , even to share photographs taken with higher - quality cameras			0
but for now the company is putting mobility and speed ahead of those features			0
" our focus on building out a mobile - only experience is a unique path that we 've chosen for many reasons , the most important of which is that @entity1 , at its core , is about seeing and taking photos on - the - go , " said co-founder @entity57 in a blog post announcing the feature			1
the web interface is missing other parts familiar to app users , as well			0
the explore page that allows you to browse by users or hashtags is not there , and neither is the fun photo - map feature that lets you see where in the world a user took all their photos			1
third - party instagram client @entity82 has an online version of your @entity1 feed			2
though not nearly as attractive as the new official version , it still has some of those features missing from @entity1 's website , including the ability to click on hashtags and see your followers and those people you are following .			2

photo - sharing service @entity1 now lets you see your feed on any *computer*
users still can not upload photos from a desktop or browse by hashtags
the mobile - first company has been rolling out desktop features *slowly* over the past year
