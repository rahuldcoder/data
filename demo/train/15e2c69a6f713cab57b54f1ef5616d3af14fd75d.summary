a joint venture between @entity8 giant , @entity9 , and @entity11 electric vehicle makers , @entity12 , the @entity4 is the latest car to take advantage of @entity11 's push to put more green vehicles on its roads			1
it will start selling in september			0
@entity4 's affordable price places it at the opposite end of the market from its competitor , @entity24 , another @entity11 - focused green model that is twice the cost at rmb 734,000 ( $ 117,500 )			1
the government is helping to boost @entity4 's attractiveness with subsidies of up to rmb 120,000 that can be deducted from each vehicle , says @entity9			1

@entity42 cool to combat escalating levels of air pollution , the @entity11 government is promoting low - emission vehicles to the average driver , and has set a target of putting five million electric cars on the road by 2020			1

he is looking for a smaller car that will make parking easier , but he 's also looking for a " younger and cooler " brand of car to be seen in			0
as a @entity81 resident , @entity79 must apply for a license plate through a lottery system designed to limit the number of cars on the road			0
however , @entity9 says its @entity4 will be exempt from this system and buyers in @entity97 and @entity98 can even get free license plates			2
