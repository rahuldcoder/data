-- football fans traveling to @entity2 for this summer 's @entity3 have been warned they will face a " criminal " police force mired in so many abuse scandals that their behavior threatens to ruin the showpiece tournament			1
the @entity9 report " @entity2 : @entity16 jeopardised by criminal police force " details how @entity2 's security forces have been implicated in numerous cases of torture and extortion in cities due to host matches			1
according to the report , one recent case in the western city of @entity20 -- where @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 will play -- details how two men were beaten , robbed and then imprisoned by six police officers after a disagreement in a bar			2
prosecutors originally refused to open a criminal case until @entity31 footage emerged of the incident after one of the men 's lawyers gave an interview to a local tv station			0
" the @entity2 government must take action now to stop widespread police criminality , " said @entity38 , @entity9 's director for @entity39 and @entity40			1
" failure to do so will encourage them to continue acting as a law unto themselves and put @entity16 fans in danger from a force that is out of control			1
" tens of thousands of fans from across @entity39 are expected to arrive in @entity2 next month when the tournament -- which is being co-hosted with neighboring @entity55 -- begins on june 8			1
despite huge investment in the country 's transport infrastructure , @entity2 has struggled in the run up to the tournament			2
stadium delays had initially put the country 's hosting of the tournament in jeopardy but now new problems have emerged			0
hotel prices during the tournament have risen so sharply due to profiteering that @entity69 , head of @entity39 football 's governing body @entity70 , was unusually critical when visiting @entity2 last month for the opening of a new airport terminal			1
" it 's annoying to have made a lot of investment and then say to people that they ca n't come because there are bandits and crooks who want to make a lot of money during this @entity84 , " he told the assembled press in @entity20			0
security concerns were raised when multiple bombs exploded in the city of @entity88 , close to @entity89 where @entity90 will be playing some of their matches			1
more than 20 people were injured in the blasts			0
the authorities have so far blamed criminal gangs rather than terrorists for the attack			0
and the tournament received more bad publicity when several @entity39 leaders suggested they might boycott the event in protest at the treatment of former prime minister @entity104			1
@entity104 , the face of the @entity106 that swept @entity2 in 2004 and 2005 , has been in prison since last year on charges that she abused her powers while in office			2
her supporters believe the charges are politically motivated			0
the current @entity2 president is @entity114 who lost power during the @entity106			0
@entity104 would have been a potent foe in next october 's parliamentary elections			0
the government deny that there is any political motivation in her jailing but the former prime minister has alleged that she has been beaten whilst in prison and has gone on hunger strike to secure what she says is urgent medical care			0
@entity133 , president of the @entity134 , @entity127 , president of the @entity129 , and the governments of @entity131 and @entity132 have all said they will not be attending any matches in @entity2 in protest .			2

@entity9 label @entity2 police ' criminal ' *ahead* of @entity16
say that ' out of control ' police could jeopardize the tournament
