it 's been nearly two years since @entity1 assumed paramount leadership in @entity3 and the world has mixed feelings about him			1
the latest @entity7 findings show that @entity1 has received mostly negative ratings from those surveyed in the @entity10 , the @entity11 , and long - time rivals @entity13 and the @entity14			1
however , the president is viewed favorably in several neighboring countries , as well as in @entity17			0
back home in @entity3 , @entity1 also receives overwhelmingly good ratings , with 92 % of @entity21 people polled expressing confidence in him			1
to many @entity3 watchers , such a mixed bag of ratings confirms that @entity1 remains a cipher			1
people -- both inside @entity3 and out -- are still debating : is @entity1 a reformist or tyrant ? the man who took over the @entity32 's paramount post in november 2012 , and six months later the state presidency , certainly has the pedigree for leadership			1
the son of a respected @entity32 guerrilla leader who was an ally of @entity38 , the architect of @entity3 's reform program , @entity1 grew up in @entity40 with fellow " princelings " and political elite			1
since taking control , he 's assumed a raft of top posts in the party , the government and the military ; some @entity3 watchers have dubbed him " @entity50			2
" @entity52 reformist @entity3 's leader faces a long list of challenges : economic slowdown , corruption , growing gap between the rich and poor , rising criminality , environmental and ecological degradation			1
simmering ethnic tensions in the frontier regions of @entity63 and @entity64 , which in recent months have witnessed some of the worst ethnic violence , are also cause for worry , as are territorial disputes with @entity13 , the @entity14 and @entity69			0
" @entity75 is beset by crisis because it is moving into an era where so many sociopolitical challenges need to be addressed , " says @entity70 , professor of @entity71 and director of the @entity73 at the @entity74			0
@entity1 's political resume shows that he 's ideally placed for implementing reform , particularly economic			1
as a provincial leader in southern @entity3 , @entity1 was in charge of free market - dominated economies			1
" all evidence shows he worked well with them , and was always very cautious , " says @entity70 , who is also the author of " @entity85 : power and the @entity89 in @entity3			1
" " @entity1 's record shows an orthodox reformist , nothing more			1
" contradictions yet , after almost two years at the helm of the world 's second - largest economy , his policies and promises suggest that he is a bundle of contradictions			1
while some see him as a reformer , others view him as a throwback			0
to tighten his grip on the 80 - million strong @entity32 , he preaches ideological orthodoxy , and has revived some communist rhetoric and practices , such " criticism and self - criticism " sessions			0
and he 's also cracked down on @entity3 's nascent dissenting voices			2
in recent months , @entity3 has detained scores of liberal intellectuals and many more civil rights activists			2
he has also silenced raucous bloggers			0
these examples of heavy - handedness have dashed earlier hopes that @entity1 may be a potential liberal reformer			2
" i do n't think he is a reformist , " says @entity120 , a human rights lawyer and a leader of @entity3 's citizens ' right movement			1
" he is collecting power in order to be a dictator			1
he hates open politics -- liberal democracy -- but wants a powerful economy			0
" economic primacy indeed , @entity1 is not wishy - washy on the belief that economic growth is essential to political and social stability -- and the survival of the @entity32			2
" @entity1 's core aim is to rejuvenate the @entity32 in order to push through drastic free market reforms that he believes will make @entity3 a modern , prosperous world power , " says @entity136 , a seasoned @entity3 - watcher and author of " @entity138 " , a book about his experiences in @entity3			1
" this means nothing less than a new revolution in @entity3			2
" to succeed , " @entity1 must overcome resistance from jaded bureaucrats who stand to lose power and privileges			2
" " new revolution " even as @entity1 seeks to silence dissent and consolidate power , he has started to address sensitive issues			2
some of his planned reforms are aspirational , some are underway , but all have the potential to drastically affect the @entity21 political , social and economic landscape in @entity3			0
chief among these is the issue of labor camps , which operate outside the judicial system and have been blamed for human rights abuses and injustices			0
@entity1 's reform system could have a direct impact on this system			1
he 's also taken to task the draconian and unpopular one - child policy , which have been blamed for cases of forced abortion and infanticide -- late last year the government announced plans to relax the restrictions , chiefly for parents who were single children themselves			0
he also plans to liberalize the " hukou " residence registration system , which restricts rural migrants ' rights in cities , freeing up migration and , in theory at least , developing a more mobile , dynamic workforce			0
economically , he proposes allowing increased competition in state - dominated industries , further moving the country away from an outdated , inefficient centralized model			0
he 's also looking to drastically alter the country 's definition of economic success , by ending the obsession with gdp growth and instead aim for quality , not quantity			0
one of the more eye - catching reforms that @entity1 has in mind , perhaps crucially , is a plan to build a more independent judiciary			0
the political impact of a move away from the much - maligned system remains to be seen			0
@entity1 's boldest gambit so far , however , is the anti-corruption campaign which has already snared thousands of bureaucrats , military officers and enterprise managers			1
they include scores of formerly powerful senior leaders in the @entity32 and the military			0
long - term strategy " he is tactically focusing on the soft targets -- corruption , inefficiency in the state sector , reform of fiscal decision - making -- before moving onto much harder ones , " says @entity70			0
@entity1 is expected to stay in the no. 1 seat for eight more years , assuming he will get a second five - year tenure , as has been the unwritten norm since @entity38 's death in 1997			1
long - term , he faces a tougher challenge			0
" growth alone is not enough , " says @entity70			0
" equity , balance and political issues are demanding some answers			0
" " @entity1 and his leadership have to convince enough @entity21 that the good years ahead are worth sacrifice now , and that it is worth continuing to invest in the current political model because it will deliver the ' rich and strong nation ' that has been the @entity243 since 1949			2
" regardless of the direction he is pursuing , @entity1 's strength and conviction should be enough to ensure that his own vision is realized .			1

@entity7 finds @entity1 is failing to make a *positive* impression *globally*
after almost two years as president , @entity1 proves he is a bundle of contradictions
@entity3 watcher : " @entity1 's record shows an orthodox reformist , nothing more "
rights activist : " @entity1 is collecting power in order to be a dictator "
