-- reputed former mob boss @entity2 did not have the right to commit more murders after striking a purported immunity deal with the @entity6 in the 1970s , a federal judge ruled monday , knocking down a key part of @entity2 's defense at his trial			1
@entity2 , the alleged former head of @entity12 's notorious @entity11 gang , faces 19 murder charges , as well as charges including extortion , money - laundering and narcotics distribution			1
the defense had initially moved to dismiss the case , saying @entity2 was granted immunity by federal agents working to infiltrate @entity23 and @entity24 mobs in @entity12 three decades ago			2
judge @entity25 denied @entity2 had " prospective immunity " -- that is , immunity to commit crimes made after his purported deal with the @entity6			2
@entity25 left undecided whether @entity2 had " historical immunity " for crimes committed before a deal			0
he gave both sides time to review evidence on that point			0
@entity2 's attorneys had also sought to have a jury decide on his immunity claim , arguing he would receive a fairer hearing , but @entity25 refused			1
photos : @entity2 in hiding @entity2 's attorneys said he is prepared to detail the immunity deal " for past and ongoing crimes " at trial , and they said they will continue to fight for a jury trial			1
" the federal government has done everything in its power over the past 25 years to cover up the relationship between @entity50 and federal law enforcement authorities , " the attorneys wrote in a statement after the ruling			1
" the federal government , including attorneys who worked for the ( @entity54 ) during this period , desperately want to conceal this sordid history from the jury , the victims , and the public			1
today 's decision is another step toward that goal			0
" the @entity65 attorney 's office declined to comment			0
regarding @entity2 's claim of immunity , @entity25 wrote that a license to kill is " beyond the pale and one unknown even in the earliest formalities of the common law			1
" he wrote the defense has provided a " paucity of information " about the deal that @entity2 says he struck with @entity76 , then the head of the @entity54 's @entity78			2
prosecutors submitted an affidavit from a former @entity54 official who says that if @entity76 did grant @entity2 immunity from his past crimes , then it was without proper approval and against agency practice			2
the affidavit is part of the evidence the two sides will be reviewing on historical immunity			0
@entity2 made headlines when he was arrested in june 2011 in @entity93 , @entity94 , after being on the run for 16 years			0
before his sudden departure from @entity12 , he cooperated as an informant with disgraced ex-fbi agent @entity98 , who is serving a 50 - year sentence for second - degree murder and racketeering			0
according to an indictment against @entity98 filed in 2000 , @entity2 became his confidential informant in fall 1975 .			0
