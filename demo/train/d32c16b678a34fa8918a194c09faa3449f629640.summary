@entity0 -- an international manhunt is under way for the fighter shown in a video of the beheading of journalist @entity7 -- and its focus is on @entity9			1
the @entity12 militant on the video has his face covered , except for his eyes			0
but he has what sounds like a distinctly @entity9 accent			1
@entity9 media reports are rife with speculation about where he 's from			1
linguistics experts say his accent indicates he is from southeast @entity23 or @entity0 , perhaps the capital 's @entity24			2
as details of the cold - blooded execution of @entity7 emerged , @entity9 prime minister @entity26 interrupted his summer vacation to head a meeting of the government 's emergency committee , known as @entity33 , in @entity0			1
speaking to the media , he condemned the killing as " a murder without any justification " and said that while the man has not been identified , " it looks increasingly likely that it is a @entity9 citizen			2
" opinion : why @entity7 's murder was a message to @entity9 a lengthy process with an estimated 400 to 500 @entity9 recruits in @entity49 and @entity50 -- though some believe the number to be much higher -- it may take time to identify the killer			1
and @entity9 foreign secretary @entity53 said the government is well aware of the threat these @entity9 jihadis pose , at home as well as overseas			1
" we 've been saying for a very long time that there are a significant number of @entity9 nationals , both in @entity49 and @entity50 , operating with extremist organizations , " he said			1
" many of these people may seek at some point to return to the @entity9 and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security			2
" this is a poison , a cancer , what 's going on in @entity50 and @entity49 , and it risks spreading to other parts of the international community and affecting us all directly			1
" easy recruits analysts who study the @entity12 say they are not surprised by the role played by a @entity77 in @entity7 's killing			1
" the @entity9 fighters who have been going out to the @entity12 , who we 've been monitoring now for many years , are really wanting to be at the forefront of this conflict , " @entity79 , a senior research fellow at @entity80 , told @entity1			2
" they 're not backseat drivers in any sense			0
" the power of the @entity89 means radicalization and recruitment of fighters is also alarmingly easy			0
according to a defector from the ranks of @entity96 , the jihadist group runs a series of internet chat groups to begin the process of indoctrinating and filtering potential recruits from outside @entity49			1
captors originally asked for huge ransom @entity103 sought after the defector , who agreed to an interview with @entity1 earlier this summer but wanted to hide his identity , said that @entity103 recruits were more sought after and treated in a different class by the recruiters			0
" there was special treatment for the @entity103 , " he said			0
" one @entity9 guy said he was called @entity113 , then told me he was from @entity114			2
one asked my emir ( his unit 's head ) if he should fight in his own country , or come to @entity49			2
he was told if @entity119 does n't give you martyrdom in @entity49 , then he could wage war in his own country			2
" @entity124 , co-founder and chairman of @entity126 , a @entity0 - based counter-extremism think tank , told @entity1 that @entity9 jihadis -- writing on social media websites -- had made plain their intention to carry on their jihad when they return home			1
some have posted pictures of themselves posing with homemade bombs			0
@entity124 said the estimated 500 @entity9 fighters in the region equates to roughly one in every 800 @entity141 @entity9 men of fighting age			1
' fighters do n't emerge from a vacuum ' " that 's a huge proportion of this country 's @entity141 population who have succumbed to this level of violence , " he said			0
" those fighters do n't emerge from a vacuum , they do n't just spring up from nothing			0
there must be some form of residual atmosphere that 's prevalent within our communities here that somehow incubates that type of mindset			0
so it 's definitely very worrying for us			0
" there are roughly 3,000 from across @entity103 and of course we can travel throughout @entity103 without a visa -- so that means any country can succumb to these kind of attacks as soon as they return home			0
" other attackers other @entity9 have helped carry out brazen attacks in @entity49			1
earlier this year , father - of - three @entity175 is believed to have become @entity9 's first known suicide bomber there , when he blew up a truck bomb as part of an @entity96 assault on an @entity181 prison			1
the 41 - year - old , from @entity184 , south of @entity0 , told his family he was in @entity49 as a humanitarian worker -- not as an @entity96 fighter			1
his uncle , @entity187 , said , " he was a good family man			0
he had his head in the right place you know			0
we never thought he was linked to anyone other than his family and doing good deeds			0
" beheading of @entity197 journalist @entity7 recalls past horrors propaganda value analysts say some of the propaganda value of the @entity203 foreign fighter lies in that contradiction between their past and present identities			1
" in showing a @entity77 decapitating an innocent civilian @entity197 , they 've shown that they 've deconstructed the boundaries of any former life of this @entity9 citizen , " said @entity206 , a researcher at the @entity126			2
" he has left his country and he has gone to fight for the @entity12 , and in doing so he has completely rejected his former life			0
he 's rejected all ideals that he used to live in and now he 's happy to decapitate someone who is unarmed in front of a camera to further the message and threaten the rest of the world , as well as the @entity197			0
" to break down someone to that level , to brainwash them like that , is immensely powerful			0
" @entity0 's @entity223 confirmed wednesday that its @entity224 was investigating the video			2
@entity9 's @entity227 domestic intelligence agency is also said to be involved in the hunt , as are @entity197 authorities			1
besides the brutality of his own actions , that potent capacity to radicalize others will only add to the urgency of the hunt for @entity7 's killer			1
@entity1 's @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity96 fighter who talks in the execution video has what sounds like a @entity9 accent
@entity9 's counter terrorism *police* have joined the hunt for the killer of @entity7
there are an estimated 400 - 500 @entity9 jihadis in the @entity49 and @entity50 region
