this summer 23 year - old @entity0 won the " @entity4 " singing competition and with his silky smooth vocals has united @entity2 across the world			1
now he 's on a nationwide tour in the @entity7 and is set to pack theaters across the country			1
before his @entity11 concert last week he reflected on his incredible journey from @entity13 to @entity7			1
" my story is about a person who came from a very humble place -- a place referred to as ' the camp ' in @entity13 , " said @entity0			1
@entity18 is a @entity19 , born in @entity20			1
when he was five years old his family returned to @entity13 to live in the @entity23 refugee camp , where he and his six brothers and sisters call home			1
" the camp is like a densely populated residential area			2
there 's only a meter or two between each house			2
with people this close together , conditions are difficult , " he said			2
" @entity38 politically , because of the occupation , or economically , conditions are difficult			2
i ca n't even describe how difficult the conditions are -- and the poverty and unemployment of my society , " he said			2
@entity44 's blockade on @entity13 since 2007 has eased in recent years , but the border with @entity46 remains the main route for @entity19 to travel in and out of the territory			1
" getting out of @entity13 was difficult in terms of the border crossings , mainly because of the occupation , " he said			1
" it took nearly a month to get to travel , i tried every method			2
" after finally making it across the border and the 250 miles to the @entity58 hotel where the " @entity4 " auditions were taking place , @entity0 arrived to find the hotel doors had already been closed , and all contestants had been assigned numbers			1
he jumped a gate at the hotel , snuck in , and was given a number by fellow @entity19 contestant @entity66			2
" i did n't have a choice			2
i said i will do anything to make sure i get to compete , " he said			0
he made it through the auditions and all the way to the finals			0
" until i got to the final ten , i really did n't think i would make it , " he said			0
in may , when he made it to the finals , his parents spoke to @entity78 by phone from @entity13			1
" we are only refugees , " his father , @entity80 , said			0
" we only dreamed he would get to this point and show the world his beautiful voice			1
now we want him to win			0
" " i am very proud of him -- the fact that he 's @entity19 , he is popular , and he makes people happy , " his mother , @entity84 said			0
backstage in @entity11 at the @entity11 performance , @entity0 was the main and final act , following performances by fellow " @entity4 " finalists @entity94 from @entity95 , and @entity96 from @entity97			1
before the show , fans flocked to have their photograph taken @entity18			1
while clearly the center of attention he remained soft - spoken and gracious with them all , whether they simply wanted to congratulate him or tell him how wonderful his smile is			0
" the most beautiful thing is the love of the people			0
when you see that a lot of people see you as something , and encourage you , and they love you , you feel that they want to finish this journey with you that you 've been dreaming of , " @entity0 said			1
@entity0 was aware that he would be one of the few @entity116 the world would see who was not involved in politics , and not interested in taking sides			1
" my life now is wonderful , " he said , " but what i miss most is my family and friends			0
where i am from people love each other , we are very close ... fame is nice , but when they get to be with me , it will be even more wonderful , " he said			0
before it was time to go on stage he stood quietly out of the view of the crowd , smiling and looking at the floor as he waited for his introduction			0
when he heard his name , his eyes lit up , a megawatt smile spread across his face , and he took over the stage			0
an elderly woman in traditional @entity19 clothes was at the very front of the crowd , pressed up against the stage			0
she waved her arms feebly as he sang			0
" do you see this woman ? " one of the organizers of the event asked , pointing at her			0
" she has never been to a concert in her life until now			0
