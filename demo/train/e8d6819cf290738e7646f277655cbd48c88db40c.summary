at a campaign event monday in @entity5 , @entity3 presidential candidate @entity2 asserted that he too would have made the decision to send a @entity8 seal team to kill @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , telling reporters , " of course , even @entity0 would have given that order			1
" at the same event , former @entity5 gov. @entity13 , who was chief of staff to president @entity15 and is campaigning for @entity2 , said that president @entity17 was wrong to take any credit for @entity9 's death			1
" it 's wrong in taking credit , and it 's wrong in implying that someone else would not have made the same decision			0
" of course , these assertions are easy to make after you already know the successful outcome of the @entity9 operation , so let 's consider the decision - making process that went on in the @entity31 before @entity17 ordered the @entity9 raid and then readers can assess for themselves if just any old president would have made the call			1
throughout the planning process for the @entity10 operation , defense secretary @entity36 was consistently one of the most skeptical of the president 's advisers			1
his was a voice that carried great weight , as he had worked for six @entity44 presidents ; he was working for @entity46 's @entity45 when @entity17 was only 13			1
and @entity36 had enough experience from his tenure as @entity50 director to know that you could have a pretty strong circumstantial case and still be wrong			1
in the event of a ground attack on the @entity10 compound , he was also concerned about the level of risk for @entity44 forces and for the @entity44 relationship with @entity11			1
above all , @entity36 was concerned about a replay of @entity61 , the botched effort in 1980 to release the 52 @entity44 hostages held in the @entity63 in @entity64 during the @entity65			2
it was @entity0 who did make the call to send in @entity44 forces to rescue the hostages , which ended up with eight @entity44 servicemen dead and no hostages being freed			0
the failed rescue operation was a major factor in making @entity0 a one - term president			0
@entity61 was something @entity36 had lived through in excruciating detail when he working for then - cia director @entity78 as his executive assistant			2
as the disaster unfolded in @entity81 in april 1980 , @entity36 was with @entity78 the whole night of the operation , shuttling between the @entity50 and the @entity31			2
gates recalled , " we finally left the @entity31 at about 1:30 in the morning			0
... i had a long , sad drive home			0
" vice president @entity86 , who was elected to the @entity87 when @entity17 was 10 , and was chairman of the @entity89 before becoming vice president , was worried about the local fallout from a seal raid in @entity10 : a possible firefight with the @entity11 or an incident at the @entity63 in @entity95			1
@entity36 and @entity86 also pointed out that the proposed raid would not just cause problems in @entity44 's relations with @entity11 but would likely cause a permanent rupture , and that would mean the end of both the land and air corridors across @entity11 that were critical to the resupply of the 100,000 @entity44 soldiers then stationed in neighboring @entity105			1
there was also the issue that the case for @entity9 living in the @entity10 compound was entirely circumstantial			1
no @entity44 satellite ever photographed @entity9 at the compound , and no @entity44 spy on the ground had ever seen him			1
at one point in the months before @entity17 made his decision , @entity115 , deputy director of the @entity50 , told the president that , when it came to the sheer volume of data points , " the circumstantial case of @entity118 having @entity120 ( weapons of mass destruction ) was actually stronger than the circumstantial case that @entity9 is living in the @entity10 compound			1
" at the final @entity45 meeting to discuss the @entity10 operation on thursday , april 28 , 2011 , @entity36 continued to be skittish about the proposed @entity128 operation , saying , " there is a degree of risk associated with the raid option that i am uncomfortable with			1
an option of some kind of precision strike , i would be more comfortable with that			0
" the defense secretary reminded @entity17 's war cabinet that he had been in the @entity31 the night the @entity61 mission imploded			1
at this final @entity45 meeting , @entity86 was unambiguous , " mr. president , my suggestion is : do n't go			1
" at the same meeting , secretary of state @entity143 gave a long , lawyerly presentation that examined both the upsides and the downsides of the raid option			0
it was n't clear where she was going with it until she summarized			0
" it 's a very close call , but i would say : do the raid			0
" cia director @entity154 and adm. @entity155 , chairman of the @entity156 and @entity17 's top military adviser , were both strong proponents of the @entity128 raid , while gen. @entity160 , vice chairman of the @entity156 , was in favor of deploying a tiny experimental drone - fired bomb to take out @entity9 , an option that was very much on the table during the april 28 meeting			1
with both @entity36 and @entity86 still leery of the largely circumstantial intelligence and the toll that a raid would place on the critical @entity44 - @entity11 relationship , that made two out of the three most - senior officials in @entity17 's @entity172 urging against the seal helicopter assault			1
@entity160 , whom @entity17 had great respect for , was also advocating an alternative course of action			2
in essence the nation 's most senior national security advisers to the president were split down the middle about the advisability of the @entity128 operation to take out @entity9 in @entity11			1
@entity17 listened to the counsel of his senior advisers intently but kept his views to himself			2
one of the officials in the room who had attended countless meetings with the president says , " he is very hard to read			0
he 's an introverted guy			0
" as the meeting wound up , at around 7 p.m. , the president said , " this is a close call and not one that i 'm ready to make now			0
i need to go think about this			0
i 'm going to sleep on it			0
i 'll give an order in the morning			0
" at 8:20 friday morning , in the @entity197 , @entity17 gathered some of his top aides around him and said simply , " i 've considered the decision : it 's a go			2
" @entity202 , @entity86 's top national security adviser , heard the news shortly afterward			2
" i thought , ' man , that is a gutsy call			0
' first , we do n't know for sure @entity9 is there ; the evidence is circumstantial			2
second , most of his most senior advisers had recommended a different course of action			0
i remember when the president left the meeting the previous day i was not convinced he was going to do it			0
leaving that meeting , i think a lot of people had visions of @entity0 in their heads			0
" if you still think this was an easy call , i have a compound in @entity10 i 'd like to sell to you .			2

@entity2 said he would have ordered the @entity9 raid in @entity11
@entity228 says president @entity17 ok 'd the raid despite strong *opposition* on his team
@entity36 and @entity86 advised against the mission , @entity228 says
@entity236 : intelligence had not *conclusively* shown that @entity9 was in the compound
