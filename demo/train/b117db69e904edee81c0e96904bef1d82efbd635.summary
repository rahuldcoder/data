-- faced with a deluge of opposition that included pressure from lawmakers and internal dissent , one of @entity7 's leading breast cancer advocacy groups on friday reversed itself on a decision that would have cut off funding to some @entity12 projects			1
" we want to apologize to the @entity7 public for recent decisions that cast doubt upon our commitment to our mission of saving women 's lives , " the @entity13 for the @entity14 said in a statement			1
" we will continue to fund existing grants , including those of @entity12 , and preserve their eligibility to apply for future grants , while maintaining the ability of our affiliates to make funding decisions that meet the needs of their communities			1
" the group 's earlier decision not to renew part of its longstanding partnership with @entity12 , which operates hundreds of family clinics that perform abortions , triggered strong emotions across the country			1
it provoked objection even from some of its own affiliates			0
@entity12 said funding from the @entity13 foundation has largely paid for breast exams at local centers			1
in the last five years , grants from the group have directly supported 170,000 screenings , making up about 4 % of the total exams performed at @entity12 health centers nationwide			1
in @entity57 , 26 @entity56 had signed a letter calling on @entity13 to reconsider			1
@entity60 mayor @entity59 , a longtime @entity12 supporter , pledged $ 250,000 in matching grants to help make up for the loss in funding			1
" politics have no place in health care , " the mayor said			0
" breast cancer screening saves lives , and hundreds of thousands of women rely on @entity12 for access to care			1
we should be helping women access that care , not placing barriers in their way			0
" @entity59 's gift came on top of $ 400,000 that @entity12 reported raising online from 6,000 donors the first 24 hours after the initial announcement			1
by friday , the group had raised more than $ 3 million			0
" it 's a testament to @entity7 's compassion and sincerity , " said @entity81 , ceo of @entity12 of @entity82 and @entity83			1
addressing the controversy , @entity81 said only about 3 % of the group 's services provide for abortions , a hot button issue in presidential politics , while the majority of the group 's work is based on prevention , screening and family planning			0
an anonymous donor had also offered $ 300,000 in matching grant money earlier this week , @entity81 said			0
" today , the interests of women 's health prevailed over partisan politics , " said sen. @entity101 ( @entity102 )			0
" the @entity13 did the right thing			1
" other lawmakers expressed outrage over friday 's announcement			0
@entity111 rep. @entity110 added that the group 's " original stance to stop funding pending an important congressional investigation was an act of courage and prudence , making their sudden reversal today appear hollow and weak			0
" @entity111 presidential candidate @entity120 said he was " deeply disappointed " in the decision			0
@entity122 , which describes itself as the largest corporate donor to @entity12 , said thursday that 250,000 of its members had signed a petition urging the @entity13 to reverse its decision			1
" the ( earlier ) move is clearly connected to attempts by @entity111 in @entity131 to defund @entity12 , " the organization said in a statement			1
" in responding to questions about its decision , the foundation cited as its rationale a sham ' investigation ' into @entity12 launched by @entity138 rep. @entity138 , " who the group called " one of the most militant anti-choice members of @entity131			1
" in september , the @entity143 , on which the @entity83 congressman sits , began an investigation into @entity12 over the organization 's " compliance with federal restrictions on funding abortions			1
" the group said tuesday that the @entity13 had " succumbed to political pressure " by cutting its funding for breast cancer screenings amid increased scrutiny by @entity131 over how @entity12 provides abortion services			1
but the @entity156 said in a statement that the foundation 's decision was justified			2
@entity12 " is currently the focus of a congressional investigation , and multiple affiliates are under state investigations , " it said			2
" @entity12 operatives are lashing out at @entity13 across the @entity166 and throughout the media , in what appears to be a coordinated effort to paint @entity13 's policy as cowardly and politically motivated			1
" the @entity13 had also denied that its decision stemmed from politics			1
" we 've always had the right to cancel contracts for organizations that came under investigation for potential wrongdoing , " said @entity173 , ceo and founder of the group			0
in all , grants were not renewed to 16 of 19 @entity12 clinics , she said			2
" we do n't base our funding decisions on emotions or politics or whether one side or another will be pleased			0
" @entity173 was a political appointee of the @entity190 administration , in which she served as @entity7 ambassador to @entity192 and as chief of protocol			0
@entity13 was @entity173 's sister			2
@entity13 president @entity196 said the funds would have been redirected " to other programs in our communities that can provide these services more directly			2
" she said there was " amazing consensus " among foundation board members about the decision , which was made " over the better part of two years			2
" that consensus did not include dr. @entity207 , a member of the foundation 's medical advisory board in @entity60 , who had pledged to resign if the decision was not overturned			2
" i can not as a physician and advocate for women 's health continue to be a part of the organization if it continues in this direction , " @entity207 said			0
" a big part of what @entity13 does is reach underserved communities of women			2
with this ( earlier ) decision , they 're not living up to this mission			0
" @entity225 , the group 's managing director of community health programs , left @entity13 this month			2
" it was an honor to oversee and expand their public health efforts during my six years there , " @entity225 said			0
" at the same time , i respect the work of @entity12 , including their lifesaving efforts to detect cancer in its earliest stages			0
the divide between these two very important organizations saddens me			0
" it was n't immediately clear whether she had resigned			0
@entity196 said it 's policy not to release information about employees other than start and end dates .			0
