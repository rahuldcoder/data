@entity0 -- in his first televised interview since he was launched toward the presidency again , @entity3 's powerful prime minister @entity2 said monday that his goal of returning to the @entity7 was to " stabilize " and " diversify " the national economy as well as to " strengthen the fundamental basis of the political system and the democratic institutions " of the country			1
@entity2 said he " had never sought this post ( the presidency ) " in the first place , but once he accepted his responsibilities , he wanted to continue pulling @entity3 out of decades of economic and political turbulence following the demise of the @entity19			1
" if i start something , i either try to complete it , or at least improve things as much as i can , " he said			1
he pointed to the examples of @entity24 , who led the @entity26 as president for four consecutive terms ; former @entity30 chancellor @entity29 , who was in office for 16 years ; and @entity33 @entity32 and @entity35 leaders who served lengthy tenures			0
however , @entity2 said that using his political influence he could have easily adjusted the @entity3 constitution to allow himself another consecutive run after having served two presidential terms from 2000 to 2008 , but chose not to do so and stepped down , paving the way for his hand - picked successor , @entity42			1
over the past two years , @entity2 and @entity42 have repeatedly fanned the flames of intrigue by saying in public they would decide together which of them would run for the @entity3 presidency in 2012			1
@entity2 's taped interview was aired monday on @entity3 's three national networks -- @entity52 , @entity3 1 and @entity53			1
@entity42 used exactly the same format on september 30 -- talking to the same interviewees -- to explain that he is ceding his presidential bid to @entity2 because @entity2 has higher public opinion ratings , and therefore stronger election chances			1
but in his monday interview @entity2 said he envisioned his return to the country 's top job all along			1
" four years ago , we agreed that this scenario was quite possible if we endure this period of fairly serious tests , " @entity2 said			2
" we decided that if we go through the next four years successfully , then we will have the right to put forward our idea of power configuration to the society : who will do what , what principles we will stick to , and where we will lead our country and our state			0
" the moment came and we put it forward , " he said			0
" this is a settled issue for us , but not for our citizens			0
we proposed this configuration and it 's up to the citizens to show at polling stations whether they accept this proposal , " @entity2 added			2
last month , @entity42 called on the ruling @entity86 party to endorse @entity2 for president in 2012			1
@entity2 in turn suggested that @entity42 should take over the role of prime minister if the party wins parliamentary elections in december , in what would be a straight swap of their roles			1
under amendments to the constitution that came into force on december 31 , 2008 , the presidential term was extended to six years			0
this means that if @entity2 is elected in march 2012 for six years , he would be eligible to run for another six - year term after that , potentially keeping him in charge until 2024			2
but in the monday interview , @entity2 brushed aside widespread parallels between his future presidency and the rule of old and incompetent @entity19 leaders who led the @entity19 in the 1970s and ' 80s			0
" i can not recall post-war @entity19 leaders working as intensively as i do or as president @entity42 does , " @entity2 said			2
" they ( @entity19 leaders ) were unable , because of their physical condition			0
... perhaps , they could have stirred themselves into action , but the problem was they did not understand what to do			0
nor did they have the will to do it , " he said			0
@entity2 said his government , which successfully handled the 2008 - 2010 world financial crisis , is better than ever prepared for new economic tests			2
he said that despite the hard times , the @entity3 economy will grow by 4 % this year , and that the annual inflation rate , which now stands at 4.7 % , is projected to be the lowest in the past two decades .			0

@entity2 says he always envisioned his return to @entity3 's top job
" if i start something , i either try to complete it , or at least improve things , " he says
@entity2 's hand - picked successor , @entity42 , has ceded his presidential bid to @entity2
@entity2 has suggested that @entity42 should take over the role of prime minister
