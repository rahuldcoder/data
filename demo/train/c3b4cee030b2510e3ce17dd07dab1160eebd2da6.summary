the teacher and children were among the 27 people killed when gunman @entity26 shot his mother and then went to the @entity17 , indiscriminately opening fire on staff and young students			1
the rampage reignited a debate about guns in @entity34 and sent shock waves through a nation that has seen mass killings before -- but not like this			2
" she had an answer for everything , she did n't miss a trick , and she outsmarted us every time			1
we called her our little ceo for the way she carefully thought out and planned everything , " the family of @entity45 said about their little girl , who loved horses and asked @entity49 for a cowgirl hat this year			1

" at other schools , students went back to class with their sense of normalcy shattered			0
they were met by police , counselors and teachers , who all face a tremendous burden			0
how do they explain to children what happened ? how do they help make them feel safe ? @entity121 , a crisis counselor who gave a presentation to @entity0 teachers about how to talk to students , said they have to meet children where they are			1
" i told them that as far as i was concerned , there was really only one lesson plan that they needed to teach before they broke for the ( holidays ) , and that was to make sure that the children knew that they were safe and that they cared about them and they were going to care for them , " he said			1
the teachers ' union said classes would discuss the tragedy in an age - appropriate manner			1
the gunman 's computer and grim new details investigators have so far been unable to retrieve data from a computer taken from the home of the gunman , @entity26 , a law enforcement official said tuesday			1
it appears @entity26 smashed the computer , extensively damaging the hard drive , the official said , adding that the @entity157 is assisting @entity158 in trying to retrieve data from the computer			1

but they 're at staunch odds about how to turn words into reality			0
the @entity183 commented tuesday for the first time since the shooting , saying it was shocked and heartbroken by what happened			1

the new group , which formed out of @entity0 on sunday , aims to create meaningful dialogue -- both locally and beyond -- about what may have led to the tragedy			1
until school shooting , 1 homicide in almost a decade the debate is playing out not just in @entity0 and @entity205 , but across the @entity34			0
two national polls conducted shortly after the @entity0 massacre suggest that more @entity34 want stricter gun control			0

and a new @entity228 poll indicates that 57 % of @entity34 back stricter gun laws , the highest percentage in a decade ; 30 % think gun laws should be kept as they are			0
however , less than half of the respondents in the @entity228 poll -- 42 % -- think stricter gun laws would have helped prevent what happened at @entity13			0
sen. @entity236 , a conservative @entity237 from @entity238 and a " proud gun owner , " said he 's now committed to " dialogue that would bring a total change " after the massacre in @entity0			1
" who would have ever thought , in @entity34 or anywhere in the world , that children would be slaughtered ? " he asked			1
" it 's changed me			2
" @entity248 told @entity2 's @entity249 there needs to be better vetting before people buy guns , and assault weapons should be banned -- something sen. @entity255 , @entity257 , says she 'll propose once the new @entity258 convenes in january			1
but some say the shooting illustrates the need for more armed guards -- and possibly armed teachers -- in schools			0
gun lobby has laid groundwork against any new laws @entity269 gov. @entity268 said that if school districts decide that arming teachers is the best way to keep schools safe , so be it			2
if @entity269 residents are duly background - checked , trained and have a concealed handgun license , " you should be able to carry your handgun anywhere in the state , " @entity268 said , according to @entity2 affiliate @entity275			2
out of respect for the @entity0 victims and their families , @entity283 has removed all guns from its store closest to @entity0 , the company said			0

" shedding new light on the gunman while @entity301 , the chief medical examiner , said he was told that @entity26 had @entity303 's syndrome , officials are working to determine whether that diagnosis was correct , and whether he may have had other diagnosable problems			1
a former director of security for @entity13 shed new light monday night on the gunman			2

@entity309 said that as part of his job , which he left in 2008 , he would be informed of students who might pose problems to themselves or others			0
he also said he received " intake information , " which he said " is common for any students troubled or impaired or with disabilities			0
" the idea was to keep track of and help students who may need it			0
however , @entity309 said he never thought @entity26 was a threat and certainly never thought he was capable of such violence			0
after shooting , cops take no - tolerance approach to copycat threats @entity331 , a friend of @entity26 's mother , previously told @entity2 that @entity26 had @entity303 's and that he was " very withdrawn emotionally			1
" @entity2 has not been able to independently confirm whether @entity26 was diagnosed with autism or @entity303 's , a higher - functioning form of autism			1
both are developmental disorders , not mental illnesses			0
many experts say neither @entity303 's syndrome nor autism can be blamed for the rampage			2
" there is absolutely no evidence or any reliable research that suggests a linkage between autism and planned violence , " the @entity342 said in a statement			0
" to imply or suggest that some linkage exists is wrong and is harmful to more than 1.5 million law - abiding , nonviolent and wonderful individuals who live with autism each day			2
