when the developers of the " @entity4 " video games sat down to brainstorm their latest adventure , the first thing they decided was that they had to have a cargo plane and a cruise ship			1
no matter that they did n't have a story , script or setting yet			2
the designers and programmers immediately went to work on what reviewers say are the most memorable scenes in " @entity16 : @entity17			1
" the @entity19 game , published by @entity20 and developed by @entity21 , is set to hit stores on tuesday			1
" yeah , that would be pretty cool			0
let 's do it , " @entity21 co-president @entity24 recalled saying then			1
in an interview this week , he and creative director @entity27 offered a look at his studio 's unusual storyboarding process			1
their goal at the start of each game 's production is to " try to come up with these set - piece moments that are n't just for show , " @entity27 said			1
" in many ways , they become the signature pieces of the game			0
" those segments also take the longest to plan and build , which is why they need to be conceived as early in the process as possible			1
a memorable scene from " @entity47 : among thieves " was planned in the same way			2
it involves a firefight atop a moving train , and it 's a moment that is often referenced when reviewers compare the @entity4 games to blockbuster action films			1
@entity21 executives have said that the train scene took a long time to get right and that they considered cutting it in order to make @entity20 's launch deadline			1
after determining a game 's centerpieces , @entity21 's brass then choose where the story will take place			2
they ask themselves , " where can we go that 's physically different ? " @entity27 said			2
previous games have sent the protagonist , @entity72 , to uncharted territories that include jungles and snowy tundras			1
for " @entity16 , " the @entity72 character will explore sand dunes			1
next , @entity27 had the unenviable task of figuring out how in the story a giant boat fits together with a desert locale			0
" i ca n't start off with a big script , " she said			2
" i 'd rather be given the weird challenge of , ' ok , we 're going to do a desert and a cruise ship			0
' " @entity27 is familiar with atypical assignments			0
at @entity88 in the early 1990s , she was the lead designer for " @entity89 : chaos in the @entity91 , " a game that placed the basketball great into a @entity95 - style adventure , fiery basketballs in hand			0
( @entity27 dodged working on a sister project called " @entity99 , " which has ranked on countless worst - video - game - of - all - time lists			0
) @entity21 takes pride in its games having " character - driven stories , " rather than employing mindless action or scattershot plots			1
@entity27 spurns the use of a " silent protagonist			0
" however , character development , which she says is the game 's most important element , still has to bend to the parameters set earlier in the development process			1
" the story has to be the most flexible thing in the whole production , " @entity27 said			0
" it 's way more like working on a television show			2
" it 's a show that many people are tuning in to			2
" @entity47 : among thieves " has sold nearly 5 million copies			1
that beats the original game , which sold 3 million units , not a disappointment by most standards			1
the expectations are high for the upcoming game , and the initial reactions have been very positive			0
still , the technical improvements in " @entity16 " are n't quite as drastic as the leap @entity21 made between the first and second games , @entity27 said			1
the latest edition incorporates features the developer has wanted to have since the original , she said			0
" we 're pretty run down , " @entity27 said			0
" not only does it get physically harder as you get older , it gets emotionally and spiritually harder			0
" @entity21 does n't expect to put out another game for at least two years , @entity27 and @entity24 said			0
( a different studio is making " @entity143 " for the @entity142			0
) they said executives have n't decided whether the next game will be part of the @entity4 franchise , or another @entity21 series like " @entity150 " or " @entity151 " -- or something completely new			0
whatever it is , you can bet the development process will begin with an epic helicopter flight or car chase or explosion of some sort .			2
