-- @entity1 , when writing about her preventive double mastectomy , did not discuss how much her surgeries cost , but she did mention that many women would not be able to afford the $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 test that led her to make the decision			1
what she failed to say was why the test costs so much			2
@entity1 had the surgery , and says she intends to have preventive oophorectomy , which is the surgical removal of ovaries , because she inherited a mutation on one of the so - called breast cancer genes , @entity17			1
that mutation , according to the @entity18 , increases a woman 's risk of breast cancer to 65 % and ovarian cancer to 39 % by the age of 70			1
the reason the test is so expensive is this : in 1998 @entity27 patented two genes : @entity17 and @entity29			1
with its exclusive rights , @entity27 developed a test for mutations on those genes trademarked " @entity34			1
" because it essentially owns the genes , @entity27 is the only company that can conduct the test , so it sets the price			1
next month , the @entity41 @entity40 , in the case of the @entity39 , is expected to rule on whether it is indeed legal for @entity27 to hold patents on the @entity29 genes			1
the case was filed in 2009 by the @entity45 and the @entity46 on behalf of genetic researchers , counselors , medical organizations and patients , who argue the genes can not be patented because they are products of nature			2
much of what we know about genes traces to the @entity57			2
as a public works venture , it had a fundamental aim to make its data freely available			0
those 3 billion subunits of genetic code were to be used for the public good in the development of approaches to treat , detect and prevent disease			0
in this spirit , the @entity68 explains that gene patents , to the contrary , limit innovation and accessibility , hinder quality , slow improvement and restrict the workforce			2
studies find that researchers avoid , delay or stop work because of patent - related concerns , such as difficulty getting approvals from patent owners , worry that their licenses could be revoked or fear that patent holders could , in effect , claim what they develop as their own			2
@entity89 , a @entity90 winner and co-discoverer of the dna double helix , stresses that human genes should not be controlled by legal monopolies			2
he filed a brief in the case against gene patenting , calling it " lunacy			2
" yet some 40 % of the human genetic code is already patented			0
justices at odds over patents for human genes @entity27 's test is targeted at people at high risk			1
but most cases of breast or ovarian cancer are not related to @entity29 mutations and less than 1 % of @entity41 women are likely to have them			1
the company boasts a preeminent market position focused on three initiatives : to grow existing tests and markets , to expand internationally and to launch new products , including companion diagnostics			1
with @entity120 as the major revenue producer -- 75 % of the portfolio -- one of the ways to make good on this promise is to convince consumers they need the test and get doctors to write the scripts			2
@entity27 went to the direct - to - consumer market in 2002 with television , radio and print and launched a larger campaign in 2007			1
women 's voices created the campaign message : " breast cancer runs in my family			1
my mother , my grandmother , my dad 's sisters			2
i wondered if it would be inevitable			0
i found out it did n't have to be			0
i found out my risk through @entity34 ... a blood test that has helped thousands of women find out their risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer			1
after @entity34 , i realized i can choose to do something now , to help reduce my cancer risk now , with effective medical options			1
" rather than reaching high - risk families , researchers , writing in the @entity158 journal , warned the ads would create " spurious demand for the tests " and waste the time of health professionals who would have to filter the demand and explain genetics to those who were not high risk			2
professionals without formal training in genetic testing , however , might themselves overly rely on @entity27 's educational , more accurately called promotional , materials			1
it would be hard for me to imagine that doctors could be susceptible had it not been for a friend who called me in a panic after her gynecologist recommended the test			2
it was a routine visit			0
after giving her family history , which would not meet high - risk criteria , the doctor said she needed @entity186			0
when my friend asked why she needed it and what she would learn from it , the doctor said , " well , if it 's positive we 'll check for cancer ... if you have cancer , we 'll consider chemotherapy and radiation ... if it 's positive and you do n't have cancer , you can have a double mastectomy with reconstruction and an oophorectomy with hormone replacement ...			1
if it 's negative , then you know			0
" my friend was stunned			0
how much would it cost ? about $ 1,000 out - of - pocket ... with insurance ? she guessed she could use her savings			0
" i 'm only 43 , " she said			0
" you want to cut off my breasts and take my ovaries ? i do n't want to have children ... i do n't think ... but i 'm not ready for menopause			0
you think i could have cancer ? why ? " after a few moments of tense conversation , the doctor ordered the test and my friend left			1
she sat in her car and cried			0
after doing research , she concluded that she was not a good candidate			0
she canceled it and found a new doctor			0
finances and genetic counseling influence the frequency of genetic testing , whether people are high risk or not			0
they also affect decisions about interventions			0
the treatment @entity1 had is expensive and complicated			0
up to 35 % of women who get post-mastectomy reconstructions get infections			0
implants need to be replaced and rupture frequently enough that we have ruptured implant specialists			0
to find better options means independent research needs to be encouraged			0
when big biotech companies own genes , that stifles or even prevents innovation			0
when companies aggressively promote expensive and often unnecessary medical tests , it is n't always in the service of patients and good health			1
the @entity40 decision could set free the dream of personalized medicine or shut it down			1
in the meantime , after @entity1 's announcement , @entity27 ' stock rose to a three - year high			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity266 .			1

@entity266 : the test to find if you have @entity17 gene mutation that raises cancer risk is costly
@entity266 says that 's because @entity27 owns the @entity17 and @entity29 genes
she says @entity27 has monopoly and aggressively markets often unnecessary test
@entity40 expected to rule next month whether @entity27 , or any company , can own genes
