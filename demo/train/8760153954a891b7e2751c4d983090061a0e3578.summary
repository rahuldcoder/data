-- on the last day of october 2011 , the @entity1 says the world population will hit seven billion people -- an increase of one billion since 1999			1
to show some of the impacts of this vast human upheaval , @entity6 anthropologist @entity5 has created a series of visualizations mapping the presence of technology onto a selection of satellite images showing the @entity15 from space			1
@entity1 : @entity15 can ' thrive ' as population reaches 7 billion using data from a range of sources , including the @entity22 and the @entity23 , the images depict a sprawl of air traffic routes , the underwater cables that carry the internet , road and rail networks , pipelines , shipping lanes and electricity transmission lines			1
" these images are illustrations of how far we have come at transforming our home planet , " said @entity5 , who is founder - director of @entity33 -- an environmental education organization based in @entity35			0
" it shows a human - dominated planet where wilderness areas are shrinking and where the habitats of other species are decreasing in size , " he added			0
according to the @entity47 , it took the whole of human history until the early 19th century to reach a population of one billion people , and it was not until 1927 that the figure doubled to two billion			2
