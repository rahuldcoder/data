-- voters rejected a ban on late - term abortions in @entity4 , @entity5 , a proposal believed to be a first on a city level			1
referenda putting abortion on the ballot have been tried on the state level			1
but what @entity4 did tuesday night makes it unique among cities			1
if the proposal had passed , it would have banned abortion after 20 weeks -- with a few exceptions			2
it would also have opened a new frontier in abortion wars , which are traditionally tackled at the federal and state levels			2
with all 50 centers counted , 45 % of voters were for it and 55 % against it , according to the @entity5 secretary of state website			1
despite the defeat , anti-abortion activists said the battle is far from over			1
" pro-lifers in @entity4 and elsewhere should not feel discouraged about the defeat of the effort , " said father @entity31 , the national director of @entity32			2
" it is a brilliant strategy and we will see to it that this effort is introduced in other cities and states			0
" the municipal election followed an emotional campaign that included national groups			0
over the summer , anti-abortion activists gathered thousands of signatures to force a special election that will ban late abortions and make no exception in the case of rape and incest			1
it made an exception if the woman 's life was at risk			0
both sides have plastered the airwaves and newspapers with ads making their case			0
the defeat came the same day the @entity64 @entity63 refused to stop @entity65 from implementing a part of a new abortion law that requires doctors to get admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where they 're providing abortion services			0
@entity0 's @entity74 contributed to this report			0
