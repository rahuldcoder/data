-- in writing the book " love 2.0 : how our @entity4 we feel , think , do , and become , " here are 10 lessons i have learned : 1			1
it can be hard to talk about love in scientific terms because people have strong pre-existing ideas about it			1
the vision of love that emerges from the latest science requires a radical shift			1
i learned that i need to ask people to step back from their current views of love long enough to consider it from a different perspective : their body 's perspective			1
it 's not sexual desire			0
it 's not even that special bond you feel with family or significant others			0
and perhaps most challenging of all , love is neither lasting nor unconditional			1
the radical shift we need to make is this : @entity37 , as your body experiences it , is a micro-moment of connection shared with another			0
we tend to think of love in the same breath as loved ones			1
when you take these to be only your innermost circle of family and friends , you inadvertently and severely constrain your opportunities for health , growth and well - being			0
in reality , you can experience micro-moments of connection with anyone -- whether your soul mate or a stranger			0
so long as you feel safe and can forge the right kind of connection , the conditions for experiencing the emotion of love are in place			1
@entity37 does n't belong to one person			1
we tend to think of emotions as private events , confined to one person 's mind and skin			0
upgrading our view of love defies this logic			1
evidence suggests that when you really " click " with someone else , a discernible yet momentary synchrony emerges between the two of you , as your gestures and biochemistries , even your respective neural firings , come to mirror one another in a pattern i call positivity resonance			0
love is a biological wave of good feeling and mutual care that rolls through two or more brains and bodies at once			1
making eye contact is a key gateway for love			1
your body has the built - in ability to " catch " the emotions of those around you , making your prospects for love -- defined as micro-moments of positivity resonance -- nearly limitless			1
as hopeful as this sounds , i also learned that you can thwart this natural ability if you do n't make eye contact with the other person			1
meeting eyes is a key gatekeeper to neural synchrony			0
love fortifies the connection between your brain and your heart , making you healthier			2
decades of research show that people who are more socially connected live longer and healthier lives			0
yet precisely how social ties affect health has remained one of the great mysteries of science			0
my research team and i recently learned that when we randomly assign one group of people to learn ways to create more micro-moments of love in daily live , we lastingly improve the function of the vagus nerve , a key conduit that connects your brain to your heart			2
this discovery provides a new window into how micro-moments of love serve as nutrients for your health			2
your immune cells reflect your past experiences of love			2
too often , you get the message that your future prospects hinge on your dna			0
yet the ways that your genes get expressed at the cellular level depends mightily on many factors , including whether you consider yourself to be socially connected or chronically lonely			0
my team is now investigating the cellular effects of love , testing whether people who build more micro-moments of love in daily life also build healthier immune cells			1
small emotional moments can have disproportionately large biological effects			1
it can seem surprising that an experience that lasts just a micro-moment can have any lasting effect on your health and longevity			0
yet i learned that there 's an important feedback loop at work here , an upward spiral between your social and your physical well - being			0
that is , your micro-moments of love not only make you healthier , but being healthier builds your capacity for love			2
little by little , love begets love by improving your health			2
and health begets health by improving your capacity for love			2
do n't take a loving marriage for granted			1
writing this book has profoundly changed my personal view of love			2
i used to uphold love as that constant , steady force that all but defines my marriage			1
while that constant , steady force still exists , i now see our bond as a product of the many micro-moments of positivity resonance that my husband and i have shared over the years			0
this shakes me out of any complacency that tempts me to take our love for granted			1
love is something we should re-cultivate every single day			2
love and compassion can be one and the same			1
if we reimagine love as micro-moments of shared positivity , it can seem like love requires that you always feel happy			2
i learned that this is n't true			2
you can experience a micro-moment of love even as you or the person with whom you connect suffers			0
@entity37 does n't require that you ignore or suppress negativity			0
it simply requires that some element of kindness , empathy or appreciation be added to the mix. compassion is the form love takes when suffering occurs			1
simply upgrading your view of love changes your capacity for it			0
the latest science offers new lenses through which to see your every interaction			0
the people i interviewed for the book shared incredibly moving stories about how they used micro-moments of connection to make dramatic turnarounds in their personal and work lives			0
one of the most hopeful things i learned is that when people take just a minute or so each day to think about whether they felt connected and attuned to others , they initiate a cascade of benefits			0
and this is something you could start doing today , having learned even just this much more about how love works			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			1

love and compassion can be the same , says *psychologist* @entity258
small emotional moments can have disproportionately large biological effects
do n't take a loving marriage for granted
