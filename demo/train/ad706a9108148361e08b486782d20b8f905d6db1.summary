when people are faced with overwhelming trauma in their lives , some become consumed by their difficulties , while others emerge stronger for it			1
in special circumstances , they may find their destiny , and seek to heal the world and make all of us stronger			1
@entity11 and @entity12 are two great women whose achievements demand our attention			1
although their personal stories are separated by five decades , these women share parallel lives			2
thrust into a position of leadership for the greater good of society , they have used personal grief over the loss of a loved one to become agents for change			0
each of these extraordinary women experienced unthinkable tragedy : the killing of a black man in their life who was gunned down while still young			1
recently , the two women met in person for the taping of a video for @entity0 and @entity38			2
@entity11 is the widow of @entity39 , the iconic civil rights leader who served as the field secretary for the @entity41 in @entity42			1
on june 12 , 1963 , @entity39 , who fought against discrimination and segregation and led voter registration efforts , was assassinated by a white supremacist named @entity47 , a founder of the state 's @entity48			1
@entity39 , 37 , was shot in the back while in his driveway after coming from an @entity41 meeting			1
the @entity54 , a state agency that spied on the civil rights movement and was complicit in the death of civil rights workers , assisted @entity47 's lawyers			2
@entity39 ' murder received national attention and was a factor leading to the passage of the @entity63			1
for the @entity39 family , the fear of @entity39 's murder was ever present			1
" both @entity39 and i knew the day would soon be upon us when he would be killed , and that last night that we had together , i said , ' i ca n't make it without you , ' '' @entity11 said			1
" and he told me ' you 're stronger than you think you are			2
' " following her husband 's death , @entity11 emerged as a civil rights leader in her own right , serving as chairwoman of the @entity41 in 1995 and helping to revive what was then a financially troubled , debt - ridden civil rights organization			2
she has continued the fight for those things that were important to her husband			0
@entity11 served on the @entity41 board for 30 years and was awarded the organization 's @entity84 medal , served as editor of " the autobiography of @entity39 : a @entity88 and legacy revealed through his writings , letters , and speeches " , and through the establishment of the @entity39 and @entity95 , she has kept his legacy alive			1
on january 21 , 2013 , she delivered the invocation at president @entity99 's second inauguration , becoming the first layperson and the first woman to serve in that capacity			2
further , @entity11 sought justice for @entity39 through @entity47 's 1994 murder conviction , following two trials with deadlocked all - white male juries 31 years earlier			1
" all of us have a job to do , and mine has been to rear those three children , to be a strong , loving but strict mother , to give to society , to give back to @entity39 , " she said			1
meanwhile , not unlike @entity11 , @entity12 found her calling through grief nearly 50 years later			2
three years ago , on february 26 , 2012 , @entity115 's son , @entity114 , was shot to death by @entity117 , a self - proclaimed neighborhood watch volunteer in @entity118 , @entity119			1
@entity114 , 17 , was visiting his father , and @entity117 , who is a latino of @entity122 and @entity123 ancestry , claimed @entity114 looked suspicious and killed the black teen , invoking self - defense			1
the police would not arrest @entity117 for several weeks			0
in july 2013 , a jury acquitted @entity117 of second - degree murder			0
the case shone the national spotlight on the killing of innocent , unarmed african - americans such as @entity114 , who was armed with nothing more than a pack of @entity135 and an iced tea			1
@entity12 realized the need to fight not only for justice for her own son , but also for other families and their children as well			0
" when this initially happened to @entity114 , we thought this was about @entity114 , " @entity115 said			1
then , when she saw how many lives were touched by @entity114 's death , she became a voice for the voiceless , like others before her			1
" we have to speak out for those people , just like @entity114 , and just like dr. @entity151 , and just like @entity39 ; they were sacrifices for better lives in a better world			1
" @entity115 founded the @entity155 , and has reached out to others such as the family of @entity158 , 17 , who was fatally shot by police in @entity160 , @entity161 , while unarmed on august 9 , 2014			0
last year , she testified before the @entity163 in @entity164 on racial discrimination in the @entity166			0
in addition , @entity115 has spoken out against " @entity172 " laws , which are often used to claim self - defense by whites who shoot african - americans			0
@entity117 's lawyers did not raise the stand your ground defense at trial , but a juror admitted the jury had discussed the law before acquitting him			2
further , the judge 's instructions to the jury included mention of the law			2
in the eyes of many , these laws have ushered in an open season on black men â€” and women			2
" it just amazes me how @entity192 is using me to go from that average life , and using me to be a vessel to speak to so many people			0
i would not voluntarily give my son 's life , and the loss of his life was because of the color of his skin			2
i feel like i just have to do my part , " @entity115 said			0
despite the half century separating the death of @entity39 and @entity114 , the grieving women - turned - activists have lived and struggled under similar circumstances			1
and the more @entity166 has changed , the more it has remained the same			0
whether during the @entity212 era or 21st century @entity166 , the lives of black people have been under siege , their bodies devalued			0
then and now , african - americans have faced lynching at the hands of white men , whether police officers , self - proclaimed cops , vigilantes , mobs or domestic terrorists who were empowered to take matters into their own hands			0
history is about change , and yet it represents a continuum as well , with injustice likely to repeat itself , particularly if society fails to heed its lessons			0
as we celebrate progress , we must also acknowledge the relentless nature of injustice , and the need to remain vigilant in order to eradicate it			0
the two black women both have faced a fight against what the rev. @entity151 called unjust laws			0
the regime of @entity212 segregation was an attempt to block the full freedom of black @entity166 and stifle their aspirations , backed by the authority of the government and the courts , and secured through the threat of violence			0
people such as @entity39 were willing to take the risk of becoming martyrs to break down those arbitrary , oppressive laws			1
however , today the country is witnessing a backlash against progress , with a rollback of the civil rights legislation of the 1960s , restrictions on the right to vote , and gun laws that endanger black lives such as that of @entity114			1
unjust laws have turned @entity166 into a nation of entrenched poverty and heightened economic inequality , unparalleled gun homicide and the largest prison population in the world			0
meanwhile , in the midst of a nascent , multiracial # blacklivesmatter movement led by black women , @entity11 and @entity12 continue the struggle and teach a new generation of leaders			0
" life does go on , but we must never forget that we can not stop at one point , that it calls us to continue , " said @entity11			0
" and there are young people out there who need to be reached , who need to know what this is about , and who will eventually dedicate themselves to justice , to peace , to equality and to love			0
" during @entity290 , we are reminded that civil rights martyrs become catalysts for new movements			0
and great women lead and transform the world .			0

three years after @entity114 's killing , his mother meets @entity39 ' widow
@entity302 : both women confronted injustice , were made stronger by the trauma they endured
