@entity0 , @entity1 -- as a boy in @entity5 , @entity3 dreamed of becoming a priest and serving parishioners all over the world			1
his dream of ordination came true , but his relationship with parishioners has become the object of international scrutiny			2
now 82 years old , @entity3 is sitting in an @entity15 jail awaiting extradition to @entity5 to face the charge that he raped a boy more than 40 years ago			1
his story is part of a growing crisis in the @entity5 @entity22 , which has recently admitted its leaders hid , moved and even exported suspected pedophile priests abroad to cover up horrific crimes			0
@entity26 has been badly shaken by a government - backed report that found the @entity29 of @entity30 and other church authorities covered up child abuse by priests from 1975 to 2004			0
child sexual abuse was widespread then , the report found			0
pope @entity35 said wednesday that he has finished writing an official statement , or pastoral letter , on the child abuse scandal facing the @entity40 church and he is expected to release the letter on saturday			0
the head of the @entity5 @entity22 , cardinal @entity43 , said wednesday that the church 's response to abuse had been " hopelessly inadequate			0
" as a priest , @entity3 was first suspended in 1964 and sent for psychiatric treatment in @entity30			1
throughout the ' 60s and ' 70s he was suspended and sent for treatment three times			2
eventually , he was sent to @entity51 , where the @entity22 ran a treatment facility for priests with various addictions and sexual problems			2
in 1982 , @entity3 resurfaced in the tiny @entity1 town of @entity0 to fill in for a priest at the small parish of @entity59			1
it was there and then that a boy would come to the priest 's home , just across the street from church , and find himself in @entity3 's arms			1
" as i was leaving , he gave me a hug and as he did so he stuck his tongue down my throat , " that person , now grown , told @entity2			0
" he had been drinking			0
... i ca n't say if he was drunk but he was definitely drinking			0
" the man , who requested anonymity , said the abuse never went further			0
but @entity3 's arrest in @entity15 , based on the accusation against him in @entity5 , has refocused attention not only on the @entity40 church , but also on the secrets of a small - town @entity1 parish			1
" to this day , i wonder how many people ... had encounters with him , " said the man who says @entity3 kissed him as a child			1
@entity3 's attorney did not return calls from @entity2			1
the rev. @entity89 , the @entity59 priest who @entity3 filled in for in the early ' 80s , said he knew nothing of the allegations against @entity3			2
but the diocese overseeing @entity59 told @entity2 that @entity3 was sent from the church to treatment because parents were concerned he had an " unnatural attraction to minor males			1
" he never returned to the parish			0
now , decades later , some of @entity3 's former @entity0 parishioners may see their old priest again -- in the benches of a courtroom in @entity5 , where he is expected to stand trial .			2
