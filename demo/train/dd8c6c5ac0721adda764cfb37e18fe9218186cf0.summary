-- for the first time in months , the ever - worsening @entity2 crisis seemed to have taken a surprising turn for the better			0
a snap meeting in @entity6 brought together the foreign ministers of @entity2 , the @entity8 and the @entity9 with their @entity11 counterpart , despite earlier threats by the @entity13 not to participate			0
even more unexpectedly for the many observers who had placed little hope in the talks , a one - page agreement emerged that outlines steps to de-escalate the situation and to prevent it from turning into open war			2
however , neither the very contents of the accord nor the obvious skepticism among its signatories suggest that it will effectively ease the internal and international tensions around @entity2			2
instead , this declaration is set to be an important tactical victory for @entity30 , the key driver of the conflict			1
at first glance , the @entity6 agreement appears to contain the pre-requisites for a peaceful political settlement of the @entity2 crisis			2
all sides are called upon to refrain from violence , provocation and extremism			0
armed groups are to lay down their weapons , and occupied public spaces and buildings are to be vacated			0
the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) is to monitor agreed de-escalation measures centrally			0
a constitutional process is to begin and include broad national dialogue across all @entity50 regions and constituencies			0
and in parallel to these political steps , economic and financial support is to be discussed by the international community			0
promising , one might think , if it was not for the fine print			0
the ink under the accord had barely dried when the signatory parties offered widely differing interpretations of its contents			1
where @entity2 and the @entity63 directed their demands at @entity11 - backed separatists in @entity2 , @entity30 was quick to point out that @entity69 protesters were to surrender , too , including the @entity70			1
if @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 envisage constitutional changes strengthening de-centralization , regional and local self - government , and minority languages , @entity71 renewed its call for a federalization of @entity2 , including the right of regions to their own foreign and economic policies			1
the financial stabilization of @entity2 , although unspecified , was clearly included to pre-empt the country 's political implosion , while @entity30 insisted that aid be conditional on the implementation of the de-escalation plan , and on the fulfillment of its own demands			1
in short , the @entity6 talks have not delivered consensus , but have served , first and foremost , as a platform for @entity30 to reiterate its own positions			1
no less revealing is the fact that several key aspects of the @entity2 crisis are absent from the declaration			0
the @entity11 annexation of @entity103 went unmentioned , and while merely intended by @entity2 and the @entity63 to facilitate talks , the @entity13 was quick to read this silence as an effective acknowledgement of its rule over the peninsula			0
presidential elections in @entity2 , scheduled for 25 may 2014 , were not included as a crucial element of any political solution to the crisis , thus opening an avenue for @entity71 to question their legitimacy			1
the massive concentration of @entity11 troops across @entity2 's eastern borders was not addressed , which perpetuates @entity71 's military intimidation of @entity72 and the threat of war			1
finally , the @entity6 talks failed to produce a clear timeline for the de-escalation , fundamental for @entity63 governments to determine their own actions , including sanctions			0
in all these respects , the @entity6 agreement has expanded @entity30 's room for maneuver in @entity2 rather than limiting it			1
most of all , the accord affords @entity30 with much - needed time			1
given its failure so far to elicit strong support and momentum for separatist ambitions in @entity2 , the @entity13 has won breathing space and can now ratchet up its efforts			0
faced with serious political isolation on the international stage , @entity71 will likely reach out to potential , if reluctant allies , whether they be @entity142 and @entity143 in the run - up to signature of the treaty founding the @entity147 , or @entity148 ahead of a visit by @entity150 , both scheduled for may			1
in turn , the threat of further @entity63 economic sanctions has been averted , at least for the time being			0
with the door to negotiations seemingly remaining open , the @entity8 will find it particularly difficult to muster political will for leveraging considerable economic pressure on @entity30			2
@entity6 has thus handed @entity71 a desperately needed reprieve on a plate			2
this week 's four - party meeting is nothing short of a diplomatic coup for @entity30			1
while his foreign minister was in @entity6 , the @entity11 president @entity150 used his annual " @entity169 " to clarify his designs for @entity2			0
for @entity150 , the @entity170 and @entity171 are clearly @entity30 , or @entity30 , the @entity173 term for these territories			2
with this narrative , @entity30 lays the same claim to vast parts of mainland @entity2 as it did to @entity103			2
and @entity71 may just have made a giant leap towards expansion .			1
