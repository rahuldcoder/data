@entity0 -- we are still living in @entity3 , says @entity5 @entity4 -- for better or for worse			1
it 's not just the income tax and @entity8 , cornerstones of the financial system that were put into place during @entity13 's administration			1
by aggressively meeting with @entity14 and fighting for legislation , @entity13 gave the executive branch new power			1
it was under @entity13 that the @entity20 address became a major speech to @entity14			1
it was @entity13 who began the modern presidential press conference			1
and it was @entity13 who , by stating that " the world must be made safe for democracy , " established the @entity29 as an outward - looking , internationalist state			1
" every incursion @entity3 has had in the last 100 years has been based on that , " says @entity4 , relaxing in an @entity0 hotel restaurant			1
even the debt ceiling is a remnant of the @entity13 era , having been first enacted as a measure during @entity38 other biographies have focused on @entity13 the statesman and president			1
in his new biography , " @entity13 , " @entity4 wanted to humanize the man who was president from 1913 to 1921			1
" i 've not seen a book that i felt had captured the essence of the man , " he says			0
" all the books are filled with his deeds , but not about the person behind those deeds			0
so the attempt was to write a genuinely personal biography of @entity13			1
" that meant wading into some roiling waters			0
@entity13 was once hailed as an @entity29 exemplar for his intellect -- he was president of @entity57 for several years -- and for his progressive politics			1
but his reputation has suffered in recent years because of his racial policies and suppression of free speech			1
once ranked among the five greatest presidents , he 's since fallen out of the top 10 at times , though in recent years he 's moved back up			2
but the 28th president has long been a particular passion for @entity4 , who won a @entity67 for his 1999 biography of @entity69			1
" i 've long had an interest in @entity13 , going back to my teenage years , " he says			1
" he 's just somebody who 's never failed to interest me			2
" @entity1 spoke to @entity4 about @entity13 's political savvy , his personality and some of the myths surrounding the man			1
the following is an edited and condensed version of the interview : @entity1 : your take on @entity13 is sympathetic , despite his thoughts on race			1
he was born before the @entity83 and raised in the @entity84 and @entity85			0
was he a man of his time ? @entity5 @entity4 : i think he was much more enlightened than many of his countrymen			1
but he knew the darkness of the @entity93 spirit when it came to race , and i honestly believe he felt the country was not ready to integrate			2
on top of that , he had a political agenda as well			0
he knew he could not pass his progressive agenda without the complete backing of the bloc of @entity102 , who made up a third of the legislature			0
he needed that as a base			0
@entity1 : i always thought of @entity13 as humorless			1
but you reveal there are some deep emotions there , and some wit			0
@entity4 : there are a couple of scenes that are so moving to me			1
everybody writes about @entity13 going to @entity14 and asking for a declaration of war			1
he gives an incredible speech , and the place goes wild			2
but most biographies leave out the next moment : @entity13 and ( his wife ) @entity122 get in the car and drive back to the @entity124 in silence			1
@entity13 goes into his office , puts his head on a table and sobs			1
the bookend of that is a few years later when he 's in @entity132 , concluding the peace agreement on @entity134 of 1919 , @entity13 gives a speech about the @entity29 soldiers buried there			1
in essence he says , i killed them , and that 's why i have to go home and fight for this @entity142 , so that no mother will ever have to bury her son again			2
i ca n't name another president who has copped to war deaths			2
he has the melancholy of @entity149			0
@entity1 : he did have high - minded ideals			0
he knew about the rough - and - tumble of politics , but he seemed caught up short when he had to immerse himself in it			0
although he proved to have pretty sharp elbows -- and he had the power of oratory			0
he really knew how to use that			0
he was always the smartest man in the room , so he could lord that over people as well			0
@entity1 : when you started this a decade ago , you had no idea that @entity161 was coming down the pike -- another professorial type , a powerful orator with little political experience who had a sudden rise to the presidency			1
do you think there are comparisons to be made ? @entity4 : i think @entity13 was intrepid			1
he used his lack of @entity174 background as a great tool and used his knowledge of the @entity177 and the way the government worked -- or should work -- to his advantage			0
a few months ago , i wrote an open letter to @entity161 , which ( recommended he ) take some pages from the @entity13 playbook			2
@entity1 : @entity13 has been credited with -- or blamed for -- the idea of the modern imperial presidency			1
before , power had been in the hands of @entity14			0
@entity4 : that drove him crazy			2
he felt that was not the founders ' intention			0
he also felt that @entity14 had accrued too much power and it had also had become corrupt			0
@entity13 really wanted to level the playing field for @entity29 , and he wanted to provide a genuine balance of power			2
@entity1 : you write that the story about @entity13 and " @entity197 " -- that he described it as " history writ by lightning " -- is false			1
@entity4 : it 's one of the great myths			1
@entity13 was n't even there for the whole screening			2
he knew how incendiary it was			0
@entity1 : another rumor is that his wife , @entity206 , ran the presidency after his 1919 stroke , but from the book it seems like she deferred whenever possible			0
@entity4 : mrs. @entity206 said she was nothing more than a steward			2
i think she 's something more than that , but she was no @entity216			0
it was not a power grab for herself			0
it was really all to keep her husband healthy and alive			0
@entity1 : and after leaving office , despite his severely weakened condition , @entity13 still had fantasies of returning to the @entity124			2
@entity4 : they were n't fantasies			2
it was a genuine mental condition , probably as a result of the stroke			0
@entity1 : @entity231 , who served under him , drew lessons from @entity13			2
@entity4 : there 's a scene where @entity236 and @entity231 are running in 1920 ( as the @entity238 ticket ) and they pay a visit to the @entity13 @entity124 , and @entity231 ca n't believe what has happened to this man			1
but you can see him recording it all			0
the whole @entity231 demeanor in office -- robust , look straight ahead -- he takes from @entity247			0
i suggest a baton being passed at the end of the book			0
@entity1 : did you come out of this experience with greater admiration for @entity13 ? @entity4 : i come out with greater admiration , and also greater frustration , and also occasional detestation			1
he is a giant of the century			0
all that being said , the deeper i got into the racial issue , and the suppression of free speech , the more i really disliked him			2
and ultimately , you ca n't romanticize what happened with the @entity142 ( which the @entity29 never joined )			0
i think he did himself in , stabbed himself in the heart by not giving an inch			0
he had numerous opportunities to make small compromises , and he just would n't do it .			0

@entity13 established many *federal* *institutions* we take for granted
he had fast rise -- from @entity57 head to @entity276 governor to 28th president
@entity13 's opinions on race and speech suppression have hurt reputation
*author* *a.* @entity4 set out to write " genuinely personal biography "
