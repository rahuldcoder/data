the 42 - year - old from @entity10 has traveled 550 kilometers [ 342 miles ] to @entity0 , determined to make a delivery at the @entity6			1
the policeman , however , is just as determined to stop him			2
@entity3 clutches a red case , emblazoned with a picture of @entity15 -- one of the cardinals who will elect a new pope in the conclave this week -- across it are the words , " @entity21 " or " out of the @entity21			1
" it 's stuffed with thousands of signed letters all claiming that @entity15 covered up the serial sex abuse of a priest in northern @entity26			1
they want the cardinal to be disqualified from voting in the conclave			1
but no one is more insistent than @entity3			2
when he was an 11 - year - old altar boy in 1981 at the @entity32 church in the town of @entity34 , @entity3 says he was raped by father @entity35 at least once a week for 5 years			1
he says many of his school friends also suffered repeated abuse at the hands of @entity35			2

" i was using drugs , i used to inject heroin			2
i went into rehab and had counseling , and later realized i was taking drugs because of the abuse			2
" his quest to reveal the truth behind what happened to him eventually uncovered a cache of damning documents that went all the way to former pope @entity52			1
@entity53 attempted to prosecute @entity35 for the abuse he suffered but the statute of limitations had expired in his case			2
so he had to pursue other means of gaining justice			0

@entity35 pled guilty and @entity3 was instrumental in the trial			0

as a witness , @entity3 was allowed to request all the evidence from the court			0
he was astonished by what he discovered			0

@entity15 's letter read : " i would request your kind advice on how i should act in view of the fact that the priest intends to continue his pastoral work			1
as far as possible , i intend to avoid him having any responsibilities which might bring him into contact with children or adolescents			0
" watch : papal conclave 101 this letter was accompanied by a church dossier on @entity35 , compiled by then @entity97 's chief aide , @entity96 , @entity96			1
" nothing has leaked to the papers			0
no complaints have been filed with the police , " read @entity96 's report			0
" the documents were ugly to read , " @entity3 told @entity1			0
the church was concerned with the well - being of a pedophile , but they do n't talk about a victim			1
the victims are n't even taken into consideration the only thing they are trying save is the image of the church			1
" despite incontrovertible evidence against @entity35 , @entity15 did n't kick the pedophile priest out of the church			1
instead , he was given counseling , sent to work with prison inmates and simply moved from parish to parish			0
he was even allowed to set - up and run a care home for troubled children in the church rectory			1
we do n't know @entity52 's response to this letter			0
two years later -- in 2005 -- @entity52 became pope @entity52			1

on 29th march 2010 , archbishop @entity129 from @entity130 wrote to the current @entity75 , @entity131			0
it says @entity35 " was reported in 1980 for abuse of minors " and that @entity35 admitted his own " pedophile tendencies " to the @entity96 of @entity10 in 2002			2
despite all this , it took more than 30 years before the @entity138 forced @entity35 to write a letter of resignation on march 27th , 2010			0
@entity141 : by the numbers cardinal @entity15 's office declined to give a comment to @entity1 and in a written statement , the @entity75 , where @entity35 served as a priest , said the @entity75 invited him to resign in 2009 , but he refused			1
it went on to say the diocese has been in the forefront of combating abuse by priests			0
@entity6 spokesman , rev. @entity152 is clearly aggravated by our question about the accusations against @entity15			1
he folds his arms , leans back and speaks sternly			0
" the accusations regarding cardinal @entity15 when he was @entity75 in @entity26 were investigated by both the @entity138 and by the legal system , by the judge , and the accusations were without foundation			1
" back in @entity7 , @entity3 finally makes his move towards the gates of the @entity6 but he does n't get far			1
the plain - clothes policeman lurking in the background radios his partner and within seconds @entity3 is surrounded by police who lead him away for two hours of questioning			0
