@entity0 -- one of @entity3 's biggest soccer stars went on trial monday , accused of hurling racist abuse at another player during a match last year			1
the normally staid chambers of @entity9 in @entity0 got an earful of shockingly foul language as lawyers and witnesses detailed what @entity15 captain @entity14 said to @entity18 defender @entity17 in the match			0
a lip reader watching a video of the incident told the court what @entity14 said , including two extremely obscene words			1
@entity14 did not deny directing a barrage of foul language at @entity17 and referring to him as " black , " but he denied engaging in racist abuse			1
the highly unusual criminal prosecution over words uttered on a soccer field comes as @entity33 soccer officials fight to stamp racism out of the sport , with mixed results			1
@entity38 player @entity37 was banned for eight matches when the @entity40 , the @entity33 sport 's governing body , found he had racially abused @entity43 defender @entity42			0
the chanting of racist abuse by fans also remains a sporadic problem in soccer across @entity49			2
the @entity50 is pressing charges against @entity14 for a " racially aggravated public order offense " because of the comments during an october 23 match between @entity15 and @entity18			0
prosecutors played a video of the incident , without sound , as the case opened monday morning			0
the alleged abuse came after @entity17 knocked @entity14 down during the game , the jury heard			1
when he got up , @entity14 made a gesture as if @entity17 's breath smelled , and he called @entity17 a " c --- , " prosecutor @entity63 told the court			1
@entity17 responded with the same word , saying it described @entity14 , not him , because @entity14 had had sex with a teammate 's wife , the prosecutor said			2
@entity17 also made an obscene gesture related to sex as @entity14 ran back into position , @entity73 said			2
@entity17 testified that he did not hear the comments @entity14 made at him , but that he would have been " hurt and disappointed " if he had heard @entity14 call him a " black c --- " " when someone brings your color into it , it takes it to another level and it 's very hurtful , " @entity17 said			1
@entity14 maintains that @entity17 knocked him down before the incident and that the two then exchanged " normal football verbals			0
" he told @entity40 officials that he then repeated to @entity17 words he thought the opposing player had said to him , @entity73 told the court monday			2
the maximum penalty for the offense is Â £ 2,500 ( about $ 3,900 )			0
that would be a drop in the bucket for a player worth millions , but a criminal conviction could lead to action against him by his team or @entity3 's @entity40			0
@entity14 was captain of @entity3 's national team at the time of the incident but was stripped of his captaincy after a preliminary court hearing on the racism charge in february			1

the trial could last up to five days , court officials say .			0
