-- in rock climbing , it 's all about making it to the top - and in business , it 's no different			1
at @entity6 , the two worlds collide			1
the company 's co-founders @entity9 and @entity10 talk to @entity11 about how an active collaborative workspace can stimulate innovation and creativity			1
@entity0 : how did you come up with the idea to combine physicality into the workspace ? @entity10 : there is n't a space that really exists like the active collaborative workspace and the true benefit for people is the mixed modality , the multi-dimensionality experience			1
so it 's not just an office space , coming in to kind of work on their idea			2
it 's not just a rock climbing gym , it 's not just a @entity34 © , it 's all of these things wrapped into one			1
people really just do things differently , really want to have a different type of experience			0
so we designed a place for them to come in and if they 're freelancers , if they 're coders , or they 're entrepreneurs ; they can come in here , they can sit down on a yoga ball and do sit - ups and work at their desk or they can stand at a stand up desk and do pull ups and jam on their spread sheets and also go for a climb , take a yoga class , sit in the sauna , grab a coffee , check out the street art on the wall ; you name it			1
@entity0 : the company 's first facility was in @entity65			2
what made you choose @entity6 , @entity67 as your second location ? @entity69 : in @entity6 we really brought the creative entrepreneurial aspect to the forefront			1
and climbing unlike any other sport really attracts an incredibly diverse sub-set of people			2
you have artists , you have yogis , you have foodies , you have entrepreneurs , you have coders			0
it 's a very cerebral and strategic practice			0
and we really wanted to kind of help people identify and have a really extroverted social experience			0
we layered in entrepreneurship , build , art , music and culture and really kind of created this project around the notion that physicality stimulates innovation and creativity			0
@entity0 : you 're setting up a third space in @entity94			2
how do you think people will respond to it ? @entity69 : because a space like this and a concept like this does n't exist , people did n't really quite understand or know how to best utilize it , what to expect and nor did we for that matter			0
and that 's ok , it was an experiment and continues to be an experiment with our community and our team			0
some people definitely come in here and spend their entire day working out of the space			2
they figure out how to use it and they make it work for themselves			0
@entity0 : what separates @entity6 from competing workspaces ? @entity69 : we 'll never compete in the collaborative workspace traditional environment , that 's not who we are , that 's not what we 're trying to do			1
we 're really trying to experiment in a way where people can blur the lines between work , life , and play , as we like to say			0
in ways that they 've never done it before			0
and the active collaborative workspace is simply one facet of that .			1
