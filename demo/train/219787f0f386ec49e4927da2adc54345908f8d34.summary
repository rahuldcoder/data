-- if @entity2 has any exhibitionist tendencies , this should be a good month -- one packed with star power -- for the red planet			1
on tuesday night , @entity2 , @entity6 and the sun were positioned along a nearly straight line , called the date of opposition because @entity2 and the sun are on opposite sides of the sky , according to @entity14			1
if the orbits of @entity2 and @entity6 were perfectly circular , april 8 would also have been when the two planets were nearest each other			2
but because they 're slightly egg - shaped , the date of closest approach does not occur until monday			2
that night , the two planets will be a mere 57 million miles ( 92 million kilometers ) apart			1
also on tap for the celestial show is a total lunar eclipse , when the moon will turn as red as @entity2 itself			1
" @entity2 rises in the east at sunset and soars almost overhead at midnight , shining burnt - orange almost 10 times brighter than a 1st - magnitude star , " @entity14 says			1
but no need to set your alarms or to buy a telescope : @entity2 , in all its glory , is easy to see on any clear night in april with the naked eye			2
if you miss this event , you can witness the next " opposition of @entity2 " in 26 months			0
a recent view of the planet taken from space has proved far different , but no less tantalizing			0
was it a @entity2 playing flashlight tag with the @entity43 ? the faraway glare from an extraterrestrial 's tv ? or maybe someone warming up over a fire on the @entity2 's surface ? probably not			2
still , the latest snapshot from the @entity43 is pretty cool			0
it shows the stark @entity2 landscape with a light shining in front of a mountain chain			0
while enjoying the shot , the @entity43 's official @entity57 feed says it 's more illusion than evidence of life : " ooh			0
bright spot in this pic is likely a glinting rock or cosmic - ray hit			1
" a few pictures -- shot april 2 and 3 through the rover 's " right - eye " camera -- show the bright spots , while those shot within a second through the " left - eye " camera do n't , said @entity75 , a spokesman with @entity14 's @entity76			1
hence , it 's unlikely any being -- from whatever world -- caused them			0
each time , " the sun was in the same direction as the bright spot -- west - northwest from the rover -- and relatively low in the sky , " said @entity75 , who said one could surmise that the sun was reflecting off the rock the same way in each shot			0
or perhaps , he added , the spots could be a function of light affecting the camera itself			0
either way , the pictures add to the vast photo album that @entity43 has created since setting off from @entity6 in november 2011 and landing -- some 8 - 1/2 months later and 99 million miles away -- on @entity2			1
the 1 - ton , suv - sized vehicle is carrying 17 cameras and a number of scientific instruments , making it far from your average shutterbug			1
that 's not the only event of significance to @entity106 who like to look up			0
@entity0 's @entity108 and @entity109 contributed to this report .			0

on monday , the moon will turn as red as @entity2 itself
@entity2 and @entity6 will be a mere 57 million miles apart on monday
*curiosity* landed on @entity2 in 2012 with 17 cameras in *tow*
what could it be ? @entity14 think it 's " likely a glinting rock or cosmic - ray hit "
