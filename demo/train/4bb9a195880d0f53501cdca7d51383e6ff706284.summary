@entity0 -- @entity2 is trying to convince me that being a psychopath is good for business			1
" when i look at @entity6 , or even political leaders , i do n't want them to have empathy , " he says			1
" what i want them to do is to have focus and to make the best decisions possible			2
" i want them to be ruthless , " says the ex-soldier with a hint of passion so fierce it risks betraying his claim to " have no feelings			0
" if the timbre of @entity2 's voice gives much away , his face is inscrutable in the darkened basement room chosen for our interview			1
his true identity is hidden because of the anti-terrorism operations he was once engaged in as a member of @entity29 's elite @entity28			1
@entity2 is n't even his real name , rather a pseudonym adopted to write the 1993 book , @entity32 , recounting his time behind enemy lines in @entity35			1
trauma , it seems , has been a recurring theme in @entity2 's life , which may explain the man 's ability to master his emotions			1
left at the door of a @entity0 hospital as a baby in a @entity47 carrier bag , @entity2 had a rough upbringing , in and out of juvenile detention in @entity0 , before finding himself suited to the discipline of the army , which he joined at 19			1
although he was only officially diagnosed as a psychopath four years ago , @entity2 says he always knew he was different			1
" as kids you run around the housing estates in gangs , " he says			0
" well , when the gangs started their smoking and their drinking , it did n't interest me at all ... i was always slightly detached from that			0
" as a professional soldier , @entity2 says he first killed a person during his first year in the military and was surprised to have felt no remorse			1
" you are in a situation where nine out of ten times in conflict they are trying to do the same to you			0
so you 've got a responsibility to yourself to stay alive ... you 've got a responsibility to keep everybody else alive , " he says			0
but what exactly is a psychopath ? and is the disorder a hindrance or can it be a help ? from @entity83 , to @entity84 , the annals of crime history are replete with examples of what you might term traditional -- or dysfunctional -- psychopaths , people capable of carrying out the most abhorrent crimes , those without feeling or the ability establish meaningful relationships			2
now after extensive research scientists have begun to realize a scale of less extreme psychopathic traits that may lie in some of us , ones which , if harnessed correctly , @entity2 says can be a secret weapon			1
" when we look at psychopaths , we always look at the @entity99 - type character			0
or @entity101 , but it 's a broad spectrum , " he says			0
" @entity103 is the key			0
and , in my line of work , i have found where i am on the psychopathic scale has been nothing but an advantage			0
" today , though , the grenades and guns are long gone			0
@entity2 saves his fighting talk for the boardroom , coaching top management on how to become better leaders , with a seat on five boards and a new book called @entity120 's @entity119			1
" the board room is the same as the situation room , " @entity2 says			1
" nine out of ten times the decision processes are the same			0
" i tell them , get rid of the empathy			2
focus on what you 've got to do			0
the most important thing is the mission , " he says			0
" ask yourself what am i here to achieve ? " and " empathy , " he concludes , " does n't help you get there			2
" while @entity2 's message might sound harsh , his doctrine is n't new			1
in 2011 , @entity139 's book " the psychopath : a journey through the @entity145 " estimated the incidence of psychopathy among @entity6 was four times larger than in the rest of society at large			2
in an interview with @entity148 , the journalist said the prevalence of psychopaths in the business world appears heightened because capitalism selects for their specific behavioral features			2
the psychopath , @entity139 tells the publication has been " hailed and given high powered jobs , and the more ruthlessly his administration behaved , the more his share price shot up			1
" and nothing makes a share price soar more than news of cost cuts			0
which brings me to the question : how does a psychopath fire someone ? @entity2 , it seems , is often called upon to help navigate this corporate minefield			1
" one particular woman i spoke to was brought on board to make about 400 people redundant			0
she had empathy for these people , for their families , for their mortgages			2
" " for her it was [ taking ] a huge emotional toll			0
and it was a case of sitting down with her and trying to get her to think of it in a different way			0
" so does @entity2 think the free market has taken the stigma out of the word " psycho " to society 's detriment ? " certainly if we are looking at capitalism , what we have seen is the ones who step up more tend to be high on the psychopath trait level			1
that does n't mean to say they 're the @entity199 types			0
" @entity2 says some two million people have logged on to take his web site 's psychopath test while numerous chief executives have bought his new book			1
but @entity2 insists he is n't trying to convert all heads of industry to his unique line of thought			1
" we 're not trying to make everyone a psychopath			2
that would be totally counterproductive			0
" what we are trying to do is to clear the decks for them to understand how their brands work , how their brains work , so that they can become more productive			0
" and to sum up his strategy @entity2 uses a word rarely mentioned in the context of the psychopath 's condition			1
" it 's about striking a balance , " he says			2
are you a psychopath ? take the test here			2

@entity2 argues being a psychopath is good for business , and that leaders should not have empathy
the former @entity28 soldier and *author* is a psychopath and says he always knew he was different
he tells @entity240 he did not feel remorse when he killed during his time in the military
but @entity2 says being a psychopath can be a matter of striking a balance
