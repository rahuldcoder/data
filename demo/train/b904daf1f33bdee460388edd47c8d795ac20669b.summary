" the last four holes were very hard and @entity19 pushed me all the way			2
she 's an awesome player			0
" the 2010 kraft nabisco championship winner closed with a one - over 73 after faltering with three bogeys and two birdies , while @entity38 cut her four - shot overnight lead with a four - birdie 70			0
neither player could beat par in the last five holes , with @entity1 's last birdie of the day coming on the par - five sixth			1
" i 'm disappointed but there are also a lot of positives to take from this week , " the 28 - year - old @entity56 said after only her second top - 10 finish in 24 majors			1
" i never gave up but it 's just a pity i could n't make a birdie at one of the three long holes at the end			0
" @entity67 eagled 18 to finish in a tie for third with in - @entity70 on 281 , carding 68 to her fellow @entity71 's 71 -- which ended with a birdie			0
