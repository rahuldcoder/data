-- if you have to ask , you 're probably not on the list			0
@entity4 president @entity3 hosted his @entity6 counterpart , @entity5 , at a state dinner tuesday night -- the first of his second term			1
the event is a highly coveted social soiree			0
the presidents were joined by @entity13 and the @entity14 of @entity15 and @entity16			0
the invite list is culled from recommendations from the president and first lady , top government officials , the @entity22 , members of @entity24 , the @entity25 and the @entity26			1

much like an awards show , guests streamed past a sea of cameras			0
some stopped and talked to reporters			0
the first lady wore a billowing black and blue dress designed by @entity48 , and greeted @entity5 along with her husband on the steps outside			1
when the three came down a staircase inside , she walked behind the two men , because @entity5 went to the dinner stag			2
the main event was to be held in a tent on the @entity57 of the @entity58			0
attendees were expected to dine on four courses of @entity4 - grown haute cuisine : osetra caviar and quail eggs , a winter salad " served in a wonderful glass bowl to make it look like a terrarium , " @entity62 - raised beef and a chocolate dessert sourced from @entity3 's native @entity61			1
before the dinner , the @entity58 released the names and vintages of the wines poured at each course -- a change from the last few state dinners , which listed only " @entity4 " bottles lest the price shock taxpayers			1
reds from @entity82 and @entity83 and a sparking wine from @entity85 were the selections			0
none retail for more than $ 50 a bottle			0
it all sounds very fancy -- and it is -- but state dinners are n't just about pomp and pageantry , according to the @entity58			2
" behind the festive exterior of the social scene , the important business of government goes on -- information is gathered -- opinions exchanged -- powerful connections made and appearances upheld			0
for these reasons @entity58 invitations are the most important and the most sought after in the nation 's social whirl , " the @entity58 website says			2
@entity3 and @entity5 are in the midst of a diplomatic bromance as they face international challenges that include the @entity112 civil war , @entity114 's nuclear ambitions and economic malaise in @entity116			1
a socialist elected in 2012 , @entity5 arrived alone for the dinner after revelations in @entity6 of an affair with an actress and the subsequent end of his longtime relationship with @entity123 , who was considered the equivalent of the @entity6 first lady even though the two were n't married			1
it 's not the first time a @entity6 president has come to @entity15 alone			1
@entity5 's predecessor , @entity130 , attended a formal dinner at the @entity58 shortly after announcing his split from his previous wife			2
@entity0 's @entity134 contributed to this report .			2
