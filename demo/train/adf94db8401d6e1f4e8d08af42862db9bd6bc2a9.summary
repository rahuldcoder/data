@entity2 military and intelligence agencies pushed doctors working in military detention centers to violate medical ethics by taking part in the mistreatment of prisoners by interrogators , medical and legal experts conclude in a new report			1
a report issued monday by @entity13 's @entity14 and the @entity15 called on the @entity16 and @entity17 to follow international medical standards on the treatment of detainees			1
though the worst violations cited in the report occurred before 2006 , the ongoing force - feeding of hunger strikers at the @entity2 prison camp at @entity24 remains in conflict with those standards , said dr. @entity29 , one of the report 's authors			2
in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity35 and @entity36 , when @entity2 forces began to capture suspected operatives of the @entity40 terrorist network , @entity2 military doctors were told " this was an emergency situation , and national security as at stake , " @entity29 said			2
the result was that doctors ended up advising interrogators who were devising and implementing the degrading , inhumane treatment of those captives -- practices now widely seen as having crossed the line into torture -- in " clear conflict " with their professional principles , the report concludes			1
@entity55 blocks release of @entity17 interrogation methods " the behaviors of the physicians and psychiatrists were dictated by changes in regulations and changes in the understanding of ethical principles that were transmitted by the @entity16 , " said @entity29 , a @entity13 medical professor emeritus			1
" they undermined and distorted the physicians ' understandings of the ethical principles in dealing with detainees			2
" more than 100 detainees died in @entity2 custody between 2002 and 2005 , with 43 of those deaths classified as homicides			2
the document , titled " @entity75 : @entity80 and @entity81 in the @entity82 , " was the product of three years of study of public records by a 20 - member task force			2
it found the @entity16 excused ethical violations such as the use of medical information in interrogations and the participation of doctors -- sworn to do no harm -- who were characterized as " safety officers			1
" the task force called for a full investigation of the post- 9/11 practices , including medical examinations of detainees , reviews of interrogation logs and documents on the treatment and condition of inmates			1
@entity29 said the number of physicians believed to have been involved was " probably dozens , maybe less than that			0
" but to involve doctors in the abuse of prisoners violates " a covenant , if you will , between the medical profession and society , " he said			1
@entity115 lt. col. @entity114 , a @entity16 spokesman , said monday that the report 's allegations are n't new , and the claims are unsupported			1
@entity121 agent 's ' mental poker game ' against @entity40 the allegations " have been subject to numerous investigations over the years , and those investigations -- which had access to more information than the authors of this report -- have never substantiated these claims , " @entity114 said			1
he said the health and well - being of @entity24 detainees is the primary mission of prison camp 's medical staff , " and they take this duty as seriously as they take their duty to provide medical treatment to @entity2 service members or any other patient in their care			1
" the practices employed at @entity24 -- sleep and sensory deprivation , the use of stress positions , the exploitation of phobias and noise exposure -- came to light after the 2004 scandal at @entity153 , the @entity154 prison where @entity2 troops were found to have tortured detainees			0
the scandals led to multiple investigations and reforms by both @entity160 and the @entity162 administration , which defended the use of " enhanced " interrogation methods			2
the @entity166 administration repudiated the use of those techniques when it came into office in 2009			0
but @entity29 said the guidelines that @entity2 agencies follow today are believed to be looser than they were before 2001 , though some details remain classified			0
the @entity2 response to the wave of hunger strikes at @entity24 " exposed some medically unethical practices " as well , @entity29 said			0
more than 100 detainees at the camp , located on a @entity181 base in @entity182 , were refusing food over the summer , and about 30 were being fed through tubes shoved down their noses and into their stomachs			0
the @entity16 has said the feeding program is lawful and humane			1
but the practice has been condemned by human rights groups , the @entity189 and the @entity190 , which says every patient has the right to refuse even life - sustaining treatment			2
" those hunger strikes are current			0
they 're not in the past , " @entity29 said			0
the camp 's guidelines for doctors should be changed , he said , " so physicians are not placed in a position where they 're required to violate medical ethics			1
" @entity114 said the feeding program " is focused solely on preserving the life and health of detainees in ( @entity16 ) custody , and is in line with well - established @entity2 law			1
" the feeding tube procedure " is medically sound , and is based on procedures performed not only in @entity2 prisons , but in hospitals and nursing homes worldwide , " he said			0
as of monday , 14 @entity24 detainees refuse to eat regularly and are therefore approved for the feeding program , but they do n't always require tube feeding because they frequently will " drink the supplement or eat a meal out of sight of their peers , " @entity114 said			0
" we remain committed to president @entity166 's goal of closing the detention facility at @entity24 , @entity182 , he added			0
" it is wildly expensive , it is inefficient , and it operates outside @entity2 's best interests			0
however , until @entity160 changes the law , we will continue to humanely safeguard those held in our charge there			0
" numerous countries involved in @entity17 interrogation programs			0

investigations " have never substantiated these claims , " @entity16 spokesman says
