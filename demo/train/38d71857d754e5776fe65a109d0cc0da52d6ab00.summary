-- a top @entity2 aide assigned to review problems at the @entity4 is going to @entity5 , where @entity0 reported that fraudulent records -- including secret lists -- covered up allegedly deadly waiting periods for veterans to get care			1
@entity2 spokesman @entity11 told reporters on tuesday that @entity13 , the deputy chief of staff helping the review by @entity4 secretary @entity15 , will head to @entity5 on wednesday night to interview the interim director of the @entity18 office and visit the facility			1
however , @entity11 stepped around questions about when president @entity21 learned of the depth of the @entity18 problems as the controversy continued to dog the administration			1
meanwhile , the number of @entity4 facilities under investigation has expanded to 26 , the agency 's @entity27 confirmed tuesday			1
last week , the inspector general told a @entity34 committee that 10 facilities were being investigated			0
for six months , @entity0 has been reporting on delays in medical appointments for veterans across the country , with some dying or suffering harm while waiting for appointments and care			0
@entity0 reveals @entity5 problems the most disturbing and striking problems emerged in @entity45 last month , with sources revealing to @entity0 details of a secret waiting list for veterans at the @entity18			1
according to the sources , at least 40 @entity51 veterans died in @entity5 while waiting for care at the va there			2
now , an internal @entity18 memo from 2010 , first disclosed at a congressional hearing last week , showed officials warned of " inappropriate scheduling practices " to cover up excessive waits for veterans four years ago			1
the memo by @entity60 , who was a @entity18 deputy undersecretary , referred to a growing practice of " gaming strategies " that he said would not be tolerated			1
however , the @entity0 investigation shows such practices have continued			0
in response to @entity0 's reporting , the @entity18 has acknowledged 23 deaths across the country due to excessive waits by veterans for care , and the @entity18 inspector general launched an independent investigation of the @entity5 allegations and other @entity18 problems , in addition to the internal review by @entity15 and @entity13			1
at last week 's @entity34 hearing , the inspector general said his investigation so far found a possible 17 deaths of veterans waiting for care in @entity5 , but added there was no evidence that the excessive waiting caused the deaths			1
internal memo on monday , @entity11 had acknowledged the @entity2 learned of the situation at the @entity18 from @entity0 reports in april			1
asked tuesday about the @entity60 memo , @entity11 refused to answer and instead referred reporters to the @entity18 because it was an internal @entity18 document			2
at the same time , @entity11 said @entity21 had long been aware of problems at the @entity18 and sought to address them since taking office , adding " this is not a new issue to the president			1
" in 2007 , then - sen. @entity21 of @entity98 vowed to tackle the issue of insufficient care for veterans at a campaign event during his first run for the presidency			2
" when a veteran is denied care , we are all dishonored , " @entity21 said in the august 2007 speech , adding : " it 's not enough to lay a wreath on @entity108 , or to pay tribute to our veterans in speeches			1
" so far , the president has resisted calls by @entity118 to fire @entity15			0
numerous whistle blowers from other @entity18 hospitals across the country have stepped forward to describe similar delays varying schemes by officials to hide the extended waits			0
meanwhile , an audit team sent to the @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 , discovered a list of patients needing follow - up appointments that was kept on paper instead of in the @entity18 's electronic computer system			2
@entity129 problems as a result , three members of the @entity140 's supervisory staff have been placed on paid leave , pending the outcome of the inspector general 's investigation , @entity137 spokeswoman @entity136 said monday			0
the secret waiting list in @entity5 was part of an elaborate scheme designed by @entity4 managers there who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor , according to a recently retired top @entity18 doctor and several high - level sources who spoke exclusively to @entity0			2
@entity18 officials denied any knowledge of a secret list , and said they never ordered any staff to hide waiting times			0
they acknowledged some veterans may have died waiting for care there , but they said they did not have knowledge about why those veterans might have died			0
@entity0 has sought numerous times to interview @entity15 , but the requests have been denied			0
@entity21 has not publicly addressed the controversy in nearly three weeks since first commenting on the matter during a trip to @entity169			0
@entity11 said monday that @entity21 was likely to address the matter " soon , " but on tuesday , he said he had no details to announce about the president 's plans			1
rights group calls @entity18 ' scapegoat ' in scandal over wait times , care @entity18 response " unacceptable " also tuesday , @entity181 chairman @entity180 complained of a " very weak " and " unacceptable " response by the @entity4 to a subpoena from his panel over the alleged health care delays			1
the @entity129 @entity118 told @entity0 that if the @entity18 does n't provide more details about the information sought earlier this month , the committee could move to hold the embattled agency in contempt			0
the top @entity191 on the @entity2 panel , rep. @entity193 of @entity194 , told reporters that both sides were frustrated with the response so far			2
" we do not want to give them more time if they do n't need that time -- if this is in fact is a delay , " @entity193 said			0
" there has been a credibility problem within the @entity18 and that 's one of the reason why we 're concerned			2
" the @entity18 said in a statement that it had begun to turn over documents and would continue to do so on a rolling basis			0
support for @entity15 holding for now among @entity215 @entity0 's @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 contributed to this report , which was written by @entity221 in @entity222 .			0
