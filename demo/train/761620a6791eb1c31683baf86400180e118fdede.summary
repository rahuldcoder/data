the seven - time formula one world champion remains in a critical condition after hitting his head on a rock at the @entity10 resort in @entity11 on sunday			1
but according to dr. @entity14 , a @entity15 doctor who specializes in ski safety , serious accidents like the one endured by the @entity13 are uncommon			1
" accidents of this nature are , thankfully , rare events amongst skiers and snowboarders , although of course they usually receive substantial media attention , " @entity14 said in a statement on monday			1
@entity14 , who was interviewed by @entity25 about skiing safety last january , said he was " deeply saddened and concerned " on hearing of @entity1 's accident and wished him a " speedy and complete recovery , " but stressed that the risk of injury from snow sports remains low			1
" as with any recreational activity however , it is impossible to completely remove all elements of risk when participating in snow sports , " @entity14 said			1
" the absolute risk of an injury whilst skiing or snowboarding recreationally remains very low , in the order of 2 - 4 injuries per 1,000 days spent on the slopes			1
" the vast majority of people will ski or board all their lives without ever sustaining a significant injury			0
" commenting in january on skiing injuries and fatalities , @entity14 insisted that winter sports have had a bad press when it comes to perceptions about safety			1

compare that to an average game of soccer or rugby where perhaps the same number , or more are injured out of a much smaller number of players , " he told @entity25			0
@entity14 added that in the @entity68 over the past 10 years , on average , about 41.5 people had died per year from skiing or snowboarding			2
" the rate of fatality converts to 0.78 per million skier / snowboarder visits			0
although it 's not directly comparable , in the @entity68 in 2009 , 2,400 people drowned while swimming in public areas and 800 died while bicycle riding , " @entity14 said			2
@entity1 is being treated for his injuries at the @entity79 of @entity80			0
at a news conference on monday , doctors said it was too early to say what the former @entity86 driver 's prognosis might be			2
@entity1 was in a coma when he arrived at the hospital and required immediate brain surgery , officials said			0
he has undergone one operation and is being kept in an induced coma , officials added			0
the 44 - year - old was reportedly wearing a helmet when he fell			0
doctors at the @entity80 hospital said that without the helmet 's protection , @entity1 would n't have made it to the operating table			0
" i always recommend skiers and snowboarders to wear an appropriate helmet , " said @entity14			1
" whilst they can never provide complete protection in all accident situations , i have no doubt that his use of a helmet will have substantially attenuated the injuries sustained			2
" the @entity114 ( the @entity114 ) has recommended the use of helmets on the slopes since 2006 , but their use remains voluntary			0
some travel insurance companies , however , now insist they are worn otherwise claims by injured skiers could be invalidated			0
