-- @entity1 is reloading the golden gun to take another shot at reviving a @entity6 video game relic			1
the game publisher plans to unveil a new 007 shooter based on the 16 - year - old @entity10 flick , " @entity12 , " at a news conference later this month , said a spokeswoman helping organize the @entity1 event			1
the formal announcement is to take place on july 20 in @entity17 at the annual comic - con expo			0
there , @entity1 will also show upcoming games in the " @entity21 " and " x-men " series			2
@entity23 registered web domains last month suggesting the title of the new @entity6 game may be " goldeneye 007 : reloaded			1
" the next @entity6 film , which is codenamed @entity6 23 , is scheduled to open in theaters on november 9 , 2012			1
" @entity12 " was neither the highest grossing nor the most memorable @entity6 movie			1
but the " @entity27 " game resonates with many people , even today			0
in the late ' 90s , the four - player shooting game was part of a nightly ritual at many college dormitories and after - school meet - ups			0
@entity40 , which created " @entity42 " and was later acquired by @entity41 , developed the cult classic , and @entity44 published it exclusively for the @entity46 console			0
@entity40 's and @entity44 's divorce , along with @entity1 becoming the exclusive rights holder to develop @entity6 games , has spun an elaborate web that has left the original " @entity27 " landlocked			1
@entity44 and @entity41 have been unable to come to terms on how to redistribute the game			0
@entity40 's " @entity54 , " a futuristic spy franchise , was billed as the spiritual successor to " @entity12			2
" several " @entity12 " designers left @entity40 to form a studio called @entity58 , which develops the " @entity60 " games			2
but the " @entity12 " name , story and characters hold a special place in many gamers ' hearts			2
seeing that opportunity , @entity1 remade the game and released " 007 : goldeneye " for @entity70 in november			1
developer @entity71 replaced @entity10 's likeness with that of @entity75 , the current @entity6 actor			0
the @entity70 is not typically associated with first - person shooter games , and the " @entity12 " reboot did n't necessarily break that mold			1
but @entity71 has said it was satisfied with the sales			0
@entity81 developed a recent @entity6 game , based on the " @entity83 " film			1
most recently , it made " call of duty : @entity87			0
" @entity81 was not tapped to make the upcoming " call of duty : @entity92 , " and it has not said what its next project will be			0
game industry watchers suggest the new " @entity27 " will be released on the @entity94 and @entity95 , two systems where shooting games have thrived .			0

@entity1 is planning to announce a new @entity6 game later this month
it will be a new entry in the " @entity12 " franchise , an @entity1 *representative* said
@entity1 released " 007 : goldeneye " for the @entity70 in november
