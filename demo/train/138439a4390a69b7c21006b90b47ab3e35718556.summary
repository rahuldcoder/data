-- when is a garden not a garden ? when it 's an avant garden			1
designers of the past -- who were concerned with verdant lawns , traditional flowerbeds and tasteful ornaments -- would barely recognize the experimental gardens of today			1
" garden design has always been quite a traditional discipline , says @entity12 , a garden designer and part of the team behind a new book , @entity16			1
" gardens are in a constant state of flux , and you can only do what the plants allow you to do			1
so it changes less rapidly than painting , sculpture or architecture , as it takes longer to experiment			0
" plant vocabulary there have been other restrictions , too			0
in the past , garden design was limited by the plants available , as it was difficult to access plants that did not grow indigenously			0
but now , says @entity12 , the " plant vocabulary " has increased			0
" go to any garden center in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 or elsewhere , and you 'll find plants from all over the world , " he says			1
this -- together with the influence of radical breakthroughs in the disciplines of painting , sculpture and music -- has allowed a new generation of gardeners to create spaces that owed more to the imagination than tradition			1
the birth of a new experimental art form it started with experiments like @entity58 , an extravagant garden in @entity60 , @entity61 that was created in the latter half of the @entity63 by madame @entity64 , an eccentric opera singer			1
it contains exotic plants from all over the world , set in fantasy contexts			2
" it 's completely mad , " says @entity12			0
" the section called the @entity71 , for instance , has many blue plants and blue - colored slag from a @entity76 bottling plant on the ground			0
the effect is this weird , underwater , blue light , that is at the same time eerie and soothing			0
" similarly , @entity81 -- a public garden in @entity83 , @entity84 , that attracts about 730,000 visitors a year -- showcases plants that are almost completely devoid of vivid color , and resembles a world of grays , light greens and pale blues			1
" the only color comes from things that are not natural , like painted surfaces and pottery , " says @entity12			0
taking design to the next level in @entity98 , @entity36 , the garden that belonged to movie director @entity100 eschews grass and traditional trees to embrace flotsam , weeds and found objects , creating a space that is in many ways closer to a movie set than a garden			2
modern experimental designers have been taking things to another level			1
the @entity113 in the @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 , resembles a martian landscape , complete with rock circles , curving escarpments and striking forms and foliage			0
however , modern avant garde designers are not completely free from all constraints			1
" in today 's world , we have other pressing environmental issues , such as water conservation , " says @entity12			1
" designers need to consider what is appropriate to the specific climatic conditions they are working in			2
this is of vital importance			0
" the heart of any garden ultimately , he says , a garden is a garden if it represents a retreat from the world			2
" in recent years there has been an explosion of creativity , " he says , " but we have never lost that sense that garden is a paradise , a retreat from the world , and an alternative to our normal surroundings and chaotic lives			2
" that has always been the point of a garden , and that will never change			0
" one hundred years since the ' @entity156 ' of posters began the enduring allure of steam trains : a nostalgic journey back in time 9 maps that reveal @entity164 's secret history , from @entity165 till today			0
