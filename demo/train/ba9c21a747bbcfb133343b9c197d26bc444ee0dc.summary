@entity0 , @entity1 -- slathered in a thick coat of sunscreen , @entity4 endurance swimmer @entity3 leapt into the waters off @entity0 on wednesday in her bid to swim the @entity9			1
if successful , @entity3 will set a world record for the longest unassisted swim			1
she said she expected her marathon swim through shark - and jelly fish - infested waters to take 60 hours			2
" i think it will all work out well , " @entity3 , 28 , said wednesday minutes before diving into the calm waters off the @entity1 capital			1
" it will be tough though ; it 's not going to be an easy ride			0
but we will get through it as a team			0
" the attempt has cost around $ 150,000 to finance , @entity3 said earlier			1
she said she hopes to raise money for cancer research and try to improve @entity29 - @entity1 relations			1
each stroke the @entity4 swimmer takes will be monitored by teammates in two boats escorting her and by scientists at three universities in the @entity29			2
but other than liquid meals handed to her in a bottle every half - hour by a kayacker paddling near her , @entity3 said she would not receive help during the long - distance swim and not use any swim aids such as flippers or a wet suit			1
in 1997 , fellow @entity4 @entity45 swam the straits from inside a shark cage			0
since then , several high - profile attempts to cross the @entity9 without a shark cage have been attempted			0
@entity3 said she would use " a shark shield " device that emits an electromagnetic pulse to keep away hungry predators			1
she also possibly will be exposed to jellyfish stings as she is forgoing a full - body suit that would offer some protection			0
such a suit would also offer her warmth during the marathon swim			0
but @entity3 , who has completed six solo crossings of the @entity61 , said she does n't think water temperature will be a major factor			1
" i have been sweating swimming here , " she said			0
@entity3 said she thinks her greatest advantage will be a team of scientists who have studied the lessons of previous failed attempts and will be in constant touch with people on the boats accompanying her , supplying weather and ocean current updates			1
" we can turn a negative situation into a positive one , " said @entity77 , @entity78 's boat captain who has participated in four previous attempts by swimmers to cross the @entity9			2
" we ca n't afford a negative ; we ca n't go backward			0
" despite the technology and people assisting her , @entity3 will ultimately be alone with her thoughts in the water as she struggles for hour after hour to reach the @entity89			2
" if i ever get frustrated , i think about something positive to help propel me forward , " she said			0
" i visualize the finish , what it will be like when i walk up on shore			0
" @entity94 abandons swim after storm , jellyfish stings			2

@entity99 : " i think it will all work out well , " @entity3 says before she begins swim
endurance swimmer will try to cover 100 miles from @entity1 to @entity104
sharks , jellyfish , currents among the *obstacles* @entity78 may face
if successful , she *'ll* set a world record for longest unassisted swim
