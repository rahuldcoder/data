-- say what you will about @entity3 , but the social network is not too proud to copy			2
@entity3 is reportedly considering co-opting the hashtags that first emerged on @entity6 , following its previous aping of the @entity6 model of following strangers and sharing content publicly			1
@entity3 is testing the idea of supporting the use of hashtags in posts to the social network , according to reports in @entity17 and other publications			2
@entity3 has declined to comment on the reports			0
hashtags , unique and often cryptic terms preceded by a hash mark ( " # " ) , are specially tracked and aggregated on @entity6 as they would presumably be on @entity3			1
@entity6 shows which tags are trending , and clicking on a hashtag brings up other posts with the same tag			1
@entity3 is surely interested in the additional vector they provide for advertisers			2
on @entity6 , advertisers can pay to promote their own hashtags alongside @entity6 's list of most common hashtags			0
the aggregation pages showing posts associated with a hashtag is another natural point for advertising			0
on @entity3 , advertisers could hypothetically " promote " user posts that contain particular hashtags just as they now promote " likes " of their business pages			1
such promoted posts could get more prominent and longer - lasting placement on @entity3 's @entity43 , where non-promoted items are sorted by relevance			1
@entity3 's apparent tinkering with hashtags is being framed in the tech press , all too predictably , as part of a war with @entity6			1
but the only battle that matters to @entity3 in the end is the one for the attention of its own users for the dollars of its own advertisers			0
hashtags will be a way to grow both			0

@entity3 is reportedly considering adding a @entity6 - like hashtag
the *feature* pulls together all posts that use that tag
doing so would *create* new real estate to offer to advertisers
