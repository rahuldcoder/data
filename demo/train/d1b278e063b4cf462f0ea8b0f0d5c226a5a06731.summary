-- it would have been the ultimate supergroup : the @entity3 , the @entity4 and @entity5			1

according to @entity7 ' new memoir , " @entity12 , " while traveling with @entity10 founder @entity13 he ran into @entity5 in @entity14 sometime in 1969			1
the singer had just done an interview with @entity13 and started peppering @entity7 with questions about the two bands			2
@entity7 had worked with the @entity3 in early 1969 on the " @entity20 " sessions -- later to become " @entity21 " -- and the @entity4 on 1968 's " @entity22 , " so he had recent experience with both			1
