@entity0 -- former @entity3 prime minister @entity2 has lashed out at a ruling by the country 's high court that upheld a prison sentence for him in a tax fraud case			1
in a nine - minute video on thursday , an indignant and defiant @entity2 vented his anger over the court 's decision			1
" in exchange for the commitments i have made over almost 20 years in favor of my country and coming almost at the end of my public life , i receive as a reward accusations and a verdict that is founded on absolutely nothing , that takes away my personal freedoms and my political rights , " he said			2
" that is how @entity3 recognizes the sacrifices and commitments of its best citizens ? " @entity2 wondered out loud			0
" is this the @entity3 that we love ? is this the @entity3 that we want ? absolutely not			0
the high court had said earlier thursday that it supported a lower court 's four - year prison sentence for @entity2			1
three years of that sentence are covered in an amnesty aimed at cutting down on prison overcrowding , effectively reducing @entity2 's sentence to one year			2
the high court also ordered a lower court to reconsider whether @entity2 , 76 , should be banned from public office -- a controversial issue that could play a key role in the country 's political future			1
a lower court convicted @entity2 of tax evasion last october , sentencing him to four years in prison and barring him from public office for five years			1
in may , an @entity3 appeals court in @entity47 upheld that decision			0
the former prime minister ca n't appeal the high court 's decision in the case			1
but it 's unlikely he 'll spend time behind bars , because of his age and the shortness of the sentence			1
@entity2 is a member of @entity3 's @entity59 and therefore enjoys immunity from any type of arrest			2
the @entity59 would have to vote to have his immunity lifted in order to serve any sentence			0
@entity2 , who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011 , is one of the most colorful and controversial figures in the lively history of @entity3 politics			0
a look at the life of @entity2 for years , he has been entangled in fraud , corruption and sex scandals that have often reached @entity3 courts			0
in june , a panel of judges sentenced @entity2 to seven years in prison for abusing power and having sex with an underage prostitute			0
@entity2 's attorney told reporters he plans to appeal that conviction			1
undaunted by the court battles , @entity2 has not only launched appeals , but in december made two significant announcements : his engagement to 27 - year - old @entity89 , and then , his political comeback			2
in @entity3 's february elections , the three - time prime minister appealed to @entity3 voters by denouncing the unpopular austerity policies of technocrat @entity95			0
for all his critics , @entity2 won almost 30 % of the vote in february and remains an influential figure in prime minister @entity100 's fragile coalition government			2
@entity1 's @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 contributed to this report .			0
