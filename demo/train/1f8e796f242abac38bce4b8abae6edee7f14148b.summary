@entity0 , @entity1 -- a smiling @entity3 strides into the bustling caddy area at the @entity5 in @entity0 , @entity1 , and sets down the golf bag marked " @entity7 " that defines his working life			1
the fresh - faced 37 - year old is one of the lucky ones			1
caddies for the top @entity14 golfers can bring home as much as $ 250,000 a year in the modern game , traveling the world and taking a cut of everything their player earns along the way			1
such rewards make for a fiercely competitive industry			2
these days , most caddies are college - educated and strong players in their own right -- a long way from the stereotype of disheveled , drunken hobos portrayed in movies like @entity31			1
" it 's changed a lot since i 've been out here , " says @entity3 , who took his first job in 2000 , and counts 2008 @entity35 @entity34 captain @entity33 among his former employers			1
" there used to be guys in the parking lot at tournaments , and you could pick up a bag			0
now i 've got friends who are great caddies and ca n't get a job			2
you can earn a living out here , that 's what 's made the difference			2
" @entity3 's player is the big - hitting @entity7 , and the 32 - year - old @entity35 is doing better than most			1
he 's already won two @entity14 tournaments in 2011 , cashing checks for over $ 3 million and handing around 10 % to his good friend on the bag			1
the pair started working together in 2006 , when their mutual friend @entity59 introduced them at the @entity14 's weekly bible study group			1
@entity7 agreed to give him a two - week trial and they 've been together ever since			1
" we 're like brothers , brothers that @entity67 left alone -- and they left him in charge , " @entity3 says			2
" sometimes i just want to punch him , but i love him			0
and i know he feels the same about me			0
but do n't let anybody else say anything bad about us			0
we 'll go into battle for each other			0
" like a good number of his fellow @entity14 caddies , @entity3 's first intention was to make it as a player			1
but after turning professional he struggled to make an impact , and ultimately had to make do with the next best thing			1
" i turned pro and thought , ' i 'm not ready for this , ' so i went out to caddy to see what i needed to work on with my game			2
here i am 10 years later , " @entity3 says			2
" being a caddy was n't my dream , but it 's a dream now			2
to caddy for a great player , a guy that treats me well			0
if you have a nice player to work with it 's a great job			0
" with a wife and two young daughters back home in @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity3 accepts there are sacrifices to be made for a life on the road			2
but while he often goes a week or two without seeing his family , there 's a clear upside to his schedule			0
" i sat down to work everything out once and there 's no question i get more time with my wife and kids doing this , than i would in a normal job , " @entity3 says			2
" i work about half of the time , and the rest of the time i 'm home all the time			0
i can take my daughter to school and pick her up			0
i do n't just have to wait for the weekends			0
the only hard part is not getting to my wife and kids every day			0
" when it comes to the job in hand , @entity3 sees his role stretching a long way beyond the guy who hands @entity7 his clubs and measures yardages on the golf course			1
@entity7 is an emotional golfer , and the presence of a calming influence alongside him has proved invaluable in his recent successes			1
@entity3 is an integral part of what @entity7 calls " @entity140 , " and he 's been credited with bringing a new focus to one of the most naturally gifted golfers on the @entity14			1
" it takes a long time to learn someone			0
and that 's the art of caddying -- you have to learn your player , " @entity3 says			2
" for @entity140 it 's about keeping him in the middle emotionally			0
you do n't want him to get too excited , or too mad			0
it 's about trying to watch him and getting back to that middle point where he plays his best			0
" so what exactly does being @entity7 's caddy entail on a typical tournament day ? " i try to get to the course at least an hour and a half early			1
@entity140 comes out about an hour before to start warming up , and i have to make sure i 've got the bag ready -- make sure i 've got a clean towel and all the rain gear ready , " @entity3 says			1
" we 'll go to the putting green first and @entity140 will putt for about 20 minutes			0
then we 'll go and hit balls , then @entity140 will come back and putt some more			0
and then we 'll go out and play the round			0
" following the pair around the @entity168 course in @entity0 , it was obvious they share a tight bond			2
after five years working together @entity7 and @entity3 still have plenty to talk about , and appear completely relaxed in each other 's company			1
when a tournament round ends , @entity3 can count himself fortunate @entity7 is " not a big practice guy			1
" while some of his fellow caddies are out on the range for hours afterwards , tending to their players as they hit balls until the sun goes down , @entity3 has it easy			1
" if he ( @entity7 ) did n't like a certain shot he might go and hit one or two , just to get a positive feel for it , but after that i 'm off for the rest of the day , " @entity3 says			1
" so i go play golf myself , or play tennis , or hang out with my friends			0
whatever i can do to entertain myself to the next day			0
" all in all it sounds like a pretty good life being a @entity14 caddy -- especially when your player is as relaxed a character , and as a good a player as @entity7 is			1
@entity3 is one of the lucky ones , and he knows it			2
but while he and @entity7 have a friendship that 's the envy of his fellow caddies , he 's never in any doubt of who wears the pants in their relationship			1
" we love to hang out , and have a lot of common interests			0
but we knock heads too , and he 's in charge so i always have to submit , " he says			0
@entity3 and @entity7 support @entity212 for a @entity213 , a not - for - profit corporation that offers the chance to caddy for a @entity14 professional for a day and distributes funds to an array of worthy charitable causes			1
