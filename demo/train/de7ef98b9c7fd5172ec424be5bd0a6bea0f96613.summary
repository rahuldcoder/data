@entity0 -- it 's a simple love story : girl meets guy , it 's hate at first sight , and then they fall in love			1
" @entity14 , " the original rom - com , turns 200 today , with fans around the world celebrating the story that launched a whole industry			1
the tale of feisty heroine @entity16 and her relationship with the haughty , brooding @entity18 is the stuff of spinoffs aplenty : even if you 've never read the original , chances are you 've seen one of its many remakes , from @entity26 to @entity27 , zombie thrillers to murder mysteries			1
but @entity31 's best - known and most - loved novel , first published on january 28 , 1813 , and viewed by the author as her " own darling child " was n't an immediate hit			1
" it was very well received , and it made money , but it was n't a massive bestseller in her day , " says @entity35 , curator of the @entity36 at @entity37 , in @entity38			0
instead it became a slow - burn success , turning its creator -- after her early death in 1817 -- into a literary star			2
in his recent book " what matters in @entity31 ? " expert @entity48 claims that only @entity52 and @entity53 " can rival her continuing , international appeal			1
" @entity56 @entity55 professor @entity54 puts @entity31 's enduring appeal down to " the mixture of simplicity and complexity -- her work looks so simple , so ordinary , and yet underneath , the more you look , the more you see , and the more complicated it becomes			1
" @entity31 is one of the very few real crossover writers , who are popular with the public and also feted by critics and academia -- it is very rare			1
" " it 's not just any old love story , " says @entity70			1
" it is also brilliantly written			0
@entity31 was the first truly modern novelist , and ' @entity14 ' is full of irony , craft , careful plotting -- you read it for the story , but you get all these other layers of richness too			1
" but she says the secret of the story 's success is down to its protagonists , @entity16 and @entity18 , " two terribly attractive characters who spark off each other in a very dynamic and sexy way , " and to its heroine , in particular			1
" ' @entity14 ' is the book that brings more people here than any other , " says @entity70			2
" they come looking for @entity16 -- she is the character women aspire to be , she got the fairy story , and they want it to be real			2
" the book 's bicentenary is being marked throughout the year with a series of events , starting with an international " @entity102 " at the @entity103 in @entity104 on monday , and including exhibitions and an outdoor theater production in @entity0			0
a conference celebrating the anniversary will also be held at @entity109 , featuring everything from scholarly lectures to a @entity112 -- and talks by figures including veteran mystery writer @entity115 , who turned " @entity14 " into a detective story in her " sequel , " " @entity118			1
" in @entity31 's footsteps : @entity121 novelist 's @entity55 over the course of two centuries , what began as a simple love story , sold to a publisher for Â £ 110 at the time , is now a global industry worth billions of dollars : everything from @entity131 movies to bestselling books , including 2009 parody " @entity135 , " and even themed weddings			1
" it is a multi-billion pound business , because nobody has to pay any royalties to the author , " explains solicitor @entity136			0
" they can just go back to the original text and remake programs , and as a result they 're much cheaper to make			0
" a string of hugely popular adaptations , from tv miniseries to big budget @entity131 versions has helped ensure the novel remains popular with generation after generation			0
@entity70 said the most notable boost came from the @entity156 's 1995 version , starring @entity157 as @entity16 , and -- famously -- @entity158 as @entity18 , complete with wet shirt			0
" that had a major impact for us , " she says			0
" at the time we had about 25,000 visitors a year , and that doubled almost overnight -- we had 58,000 visitors that year			0
" everyone fell in love with @entity158			0
i do n't want to go on about him -- though i could , of course , " she jokes			0
" he was n't the only thing people loved about that version , but i 'd be lying if i said he had n't had a major impact			0
" @entity176 , of the @entity103 in @entity104 , agrees			0
" the 1995 production really ignited the whole @entity31 ' industry '			1
" and it 's not just about the cash : some fans say " @entity14 " has changed their life			1
@entity31 herself wondered if the novel was " too light and bright and sparkling , " but for many it is just this uplifting tone which has " taught them to hope			2
" " our visitors ' book is full of comments from people who 've come from around the world , telling us what ' @entity14 ' means to them , " says @entity70			2
" they range from the usual ' it 's my favourite book , ' and ' i love @entity18 , ' to ' this book has saved me at times of great trial , ' she says , adding : " @entity31 was even prescribed to soldiers in @entity204 , to help them get over shell shock			1
" for @entity176 , the timelessness of " @entity14 " is key : " things change , the world is modernized , but deep down we still want the same things : love , and happiness			2
" @entity212 , director of 2005 @entity27 remake " @entity216 " says the story is universal -- whatever the setting			1
" @entity31 said that every woman wants to find their @entity18 , " says @entity212			2
" they do n't want to compromise to to be accepted by that @entity18 , they want to be their own woman			0
it 's a romantic desire that we all have			0
it 's the ultimate love story			2
" and that , it would seem , is ... a truth universally acknowledged			0
