editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is broadband television network of @entity5			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
( @entity9 ) -- for this installment of the vice guide to @entity24 series , @entity9 co-founder @entity25 traveled to @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 to immerse himself in the seedy , fast - paced , and vastly prolific and amusing world of films inspired by -- and often funded by -- @entity28 's ultraviolent drug cartels , a genre known as narco cinema			1
@entity28 has long been the superhighway of drugs into @entity36			2
it supplies most of the meth , marijuana , cocaine and poppy derivatives consumed in the @entity42 , and today the @entity44 drug trade is a $ 100 billion a year industry			1
about 30 percent of this figure is reported to be repurposed as bribes to government officials and law enforcement			0
it 's really no surprise at all that drugs permeate every level of @entity44 society , from religion ( yes , there is a patron saint of drug trafficking ) to music , and film is by far one of the most naturally gratifying mediums for the fictitious high - flying antics of outlaw traffickers			1
today there is a constant flow of b - movie releases featuring drug dealers , good cops , bad cops , women , cocaine and a lot of big trucks			1
these films love big trucks			1
see the rest of @entity44 narco cinema at @entity9 @entity79 cinema was born in the 1980s , taking a cue from the b - movie tradition of the @entity44 cinema of the ' 60s and ' 70s			1
the movement soon turned to action , guns , trucks , cars , explosions , women , and drugs			1
because 82 percent of the @entity44 population ca n't afford to see these films , cheap , straight - to - video accessibility helped it become increasingly popular			2
watching these films is now a national pastime			0
@entity25 decided he needed to be in one of these movies			0
in time he found @entity98 , one of the biggest directors in the industry , who happened at the time to be shooting two sequels to his hit " @entity104 " ( while the eponymous vehicle is a sedan and not a truck , it does get chased by a lot of trucks in this franchise )			1
@entity98 invited @entity25 to the shoot and to play a role			2
@entity25 accepted , picked up a python - skin jacket and cowboy hat and hired a band to sing drug - running songs about him for moral support			0
@entity120 , as these types of songs are called , are the musical equivalent of narco cinema , and are often the basis for many popular films .			0
