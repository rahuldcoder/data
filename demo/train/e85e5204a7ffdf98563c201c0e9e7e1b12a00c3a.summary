@entity24 : how do you guide investors to the projects that are most suited to them ? @entity45 : personally , i recommend new investors to focus on projects with sustained demands , such as those providing tools for businesses or developers , rather than lifestyle - related ones , which can grow fast but might vanish fast too			1
