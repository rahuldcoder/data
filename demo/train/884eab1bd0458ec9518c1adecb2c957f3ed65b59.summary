-- a military judge has accepted a plea deal that drops the most serious charges against a brigadier general -- formerly one of the top @entity9 commanders in @entity10 -- who 'd been accused of sexual assault , a @entity2 spokeswoman told @entity0 on monday			1
in the final case to be resolved , @entity13 is pleading guilty to adultery and mistreating his accuser in a deal that will see the sexual assault and sodomy charges against him dropped , his defense team said			1
@entity13 earlier this month pleaded guilty to other charges , including committing adultery , engaging in inappropriate relationships with three women , conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman , and obstruction of justice			2
prosecutors said he broke military law through sexual relationships -- including threats to some women involved who held lower ranks -- between 2009 and 2012 in @entity36 , @entity10 and @entity37 , as well as @entity2 , @entity38 , and @entity39 , @entity40			0
sentencing in the court - martial at @entity2 was scheduled for monday afternoon			0
defense attorney @entity42 applauded the deal in the last case sunday while attacking the @entity45 , which the defense has accused of interfering , and @entity13 's accuser in that case , an @entity9 captain the defense has painted as a jilted lover who was upset that the general would n't leave his wife			1
" after wasting millions of taxpayer dollars , the @entity9 finally admitted what it 's known for many months : general @entity13 is innocent of sexual assault			1
two successive prosecutors agreed that these charges should be dropped , as did two successive staff judge advocates , " @entity42 said in a statement			2
he continued : " the government understood that if it allowed @entity64 's accuser to be cross-examined , she would be caught in a thick web of her own lies			0
it should n't have taken two years for them to come to this conclusion , but they were driven by politics rather than justice			0
" according to defense team spokesman @entity73 , @entity13 and the government agreed to a maximum cap on penalties , and the general will receive the lesser of two sentences : either the terms agreed upon by the defense and prosecution , or the sentence issued by the military judge			1
the deal conforms to what @entity73 earlier said was @entity13 's condition for a plea deal : none of the charges to which he 's pleading guilty will land him on a sex offender registry			1
@entity42 said that the " reputational and financial costs " @entity13 has suffered because of " false rape allegations " should be factored into his sentencing			1
the testimony of the general 's accuser in the final case was never fully aired			0
she testified for several hours on march 7 , telling the court that the affair started with intimate exchanges and evolved into groping and demands for sex and oral sex , @entity0 affiliate @entity100 reported			0
she also said the general threatened to kill her and her family , the station reported			0
she was scheduled to continue her testimony on march 10 , but col. @entity114 , the presiding judge in the court - martial , dismissed the jury after 22 pages of e-mails emerged that appear to point to alleged @entity45 interference in the case			0
at least one of the e-mails also seemed to indicate that a senior @entity9 official felt the accuser had a credibility issue			0
while @entity114 said there may have been " undue command influence " by @entity45 officials , he declined the defense team 's request that he drop charges against @entity13			2
@entity114 instead ordered that the general be provided a possible plea deal			0
the defense team said sunday that the plea deal put a stop to all three charges that would necessitate sex offender status for @entity13 , as well as a charge of defrauding the government and a charge that alleged " @entity13 ' coerced and compelled ' his accuser to remain in their three - year , consensual relationship			1
" the 27 - year @entity9 veteran will instead agree that his failure to end the relationship resulted in his accuser 's emotional discomfort and distress , as did his refusal to divorce his wife and marry his accuser , the defense statement said			0
the general will also plead guilty to mistreating his accuser , which the defense team noted is " an infraction unique to the @entity157			1
" retired rear adm. @entity158 , the accuser 's attorney , said monday that " our client stands by her sworn testimony in open court that gen. @entity13 sexually assaulted her			1
" " gen. @entity13 has just pleaded guilty to multiple charges that clearly undermine his integrity and honesty for at least the last five years of his career , " @entity158 said in an e-mailed statement			1
" the strength of ( our client 's ) testimony convicted him			0
it is ludicrous for his attorneys to claim , completely without support , that the charges of sexual assault were false			1
" once the deputy commander of the @entity9 's @entity179 , @entity13 was moved to the @entity38 post from @entity10 in 2012 , the same year the last alleged incidents occurred and when he was originally charged			2
@entity13 's attorneys filed a @entity183 request for all @entity45 e-mail communication including keywords in the @entity13 case , identifying about 10,000 e-mails among a dozen senior @entity45 officials , @entity73 said			2
the @entity45 was reviewing the communications and would probably release them slowly , @entity73 said last week , but if something pivotal arose in those e-mails , the defense would file another motion to dismiss charges .			2
