@entity0 , @entity1 when you look at the gleaming buildings of @entity0 and the fast - paced development that has taken place in recent years , it is perhaps easy to forget that until five years ago , @entity1 was embroiled in a bitter civil war			1
tens of thousands were killed , and hundreds of thousands displaced , in a three - decade conflict between the state and separatist insurgents in the north , known as the @entity16			0
peace is therefore a relatively new concept here , and something @entity1 do n't take for granted			2
' @entity20 ' it 's also the primary message from @entity22 as he arrived in the island nation			1
on tuesday , his first day of a three - day tour of the country , he told an audience that @entity1 can not fully heal without " fostering reconciliation			1
" he said the " pursuit of truth " was important , " not for the sake of opening old wounds , but rather as a necessary means of promoting justice , healing and unity			0
" while steps towards reconciliation have been taken since the war ended in 2009 , mainly in terms of economic and infrastructure development , real reconciliation on an emotional and spiritual level has yet to happen			2
" we had a military victory , five years ago but whether after that there is a victory of the hearts is a question we need to ask ourselves , " the archbishop of @entity1 , cardinal @entity43 told @entity2			2
war - stricken past @entity1 has had a dark history , @entity43 said , but now it is time for the country to put that behind and construct a new @entity1 , with a new identity where each minority group is respected and accepted			1
the island nation needs , he said , to " send a message to the world that @entity1 is a nation of peacemakers			1
" the timing could n't be more fortuitous			0
pope @entity22 arrives just days after a new government was sworn in after a massive electoral upset			1
the new government under new president @entity66 has promised to make reconciliation a priority			0
he won the snap elections largely because of the support from minority groups -- including @entity72 -- so reaching a consensus is expected to be easier			0
@entity66 was a long time ally of outgoing president @entity74 during the war but defected soon after snap elections were called in november			0
multifaith greeting in a show of ethnic coexistence , the pope 's welcoming ceremony featured traditional dancers from both the majority @entity83 and minority @entity87 groups			1
at an inter-religious meeting on tuesday , perhaps the most important part of @entity22 ' first day in @entity1 , the session began with @entity93 chants , @entity72 and @entity95 blessings and then a message from @entity22 on religious and ethnic harmony			1
he will also be traveling to @entity99 , a town in the north of @entity1 , the former heart of the war zone , where he will meet with a number of families both @entity87 and @entity83 who suffered the consequences of the conflict			2
@entity1 are proud of their pan-religious , multi-ethnic heritage			0
more than 70 % of the 21 million - strong population is @entity93 , 6 - 7 % @entity111 and the remainder @entity72 and @entity95 , but religious tensions in recent years have given some cause for concern			0
outbreaks of religious violence churches have been burned down and @entity95 have been attacked -- the most violent case of which occurred in 2014 , when at least three people were killed in a @entity93 - @entity95 riot			1
@entity124 's hardline @entity93 group , the @entity125 is often blamed for the attacks			0
@entity127 told @entity2 they condemn violence but argued that when @entity111 evangelicals try to " disrupt @entity1 's culture and society by proselytizing and breaking @entity135 statues a rage develops deep inside , " his group will react			2
@entity136 urged while violent incidents between people of different religious groups like these attract headlines , leaders of a most religious groups in @entity1 say they are isolated and politically motivated			1
" there are extremists , they are not the majority , " @entity43 says			0
" so we can not say there are religious persecutions in an organized fashion			0
" @entity1 has a porous culture where people from various faiths have intermingled and taken aspects from other religions			2
" i am a @entity155 , but i am very sure @entity156 , which is followed by the majority in the country , has influenced my thinking , " he said			0
it is this co-existence of faiths @entity43 wants @entity22 to witness for himself in @entity1 , and thinks it 's the best way forward for @entity163 in @entity164 .			1
