-- when @entity3 ace @entity2 signed with @entity4 in may , observers wondered if he could develop a potent partnership with four - time player of the year @entity6			1
so far , so good for the tandem			0
@entity2 scored his first league goal and set up @entity6 as @entity4 defeated @entity10 side @entity9 4 - 1 to maintain its perfect record in @entity13 's @entity12 through six matches			1
@entity2 has now logged at least one assist in four straight league games -- and three times @entity6 has been the grateful beneficiary			2
@entity6 particularly likes playing against @entity9 , too , netting every time he has faced them at the @entity19 since @entity9 earned promotion in 2010			1
and a few days after @entity4 had less possession than the opposition for the first time in more than five years , order was restored -- @entity26 's men enjoyed 71 percent of the ball			0
@entity9 , now winless in the league since the opening weekend , struck the crossbar in the second minute but it was mostly one - way traffic at the other end thereafter			0
@entity2 bundled home the opener in the fifth minute , taking advantage of some indecision by keeper @entity38 , and @entity6 's diving header from @entity2 's floated cross doubled the advantage in the eighth minute			2
@entity6 could have had a hat - trick within 40 minutes but he hit the crossbar from close range -- holding midfielder @entity45 scored from outside the box seconds later for only his fifth league goal in five years -- and failed to connect cleanly after @entity4 cut open the @entity9 defense			1
@entity6 then almost scored from another @entity2 pass but saw his effort blocked			2
the @entity51 , following a typically driving run , pulled his jersey over his head after he blazed over the bar in the 52nd			0
@entity57 pulled a goal back in the 64th minute but defender @entity59 -- replacing the injured @entity60 -- restored the three - goal lead in the 77th with @entity6 's help			1
difficult for @entity64 it has n't been the best of weeks for @entity64			0
the @entity10 finalist lost its opener in the @entity70 competition to @entity71 last wednesday and dropped its first points in the @entity73 on saturday			0
and @entity64 needed extra time to see off second - tier @entity76 2 - 0 in the @entity77 on tuesday despite fielding a starting lineup that included @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			1
@entity64 , mind you , did register almost 40 shots , compared to 1860 's two in @entity84 , and struck the bar four times			0
substitute @entity87 scored from the penalty spot -- @entity89 fouled @entity80 and was sent off -- before fellow summer signing @entity81 made it 2 - 0 to book @entity64 's spot in the last 16 .			2

@entity4 maintains its perfect record in @entity13 's @entity12 by beating @entity9 4 - 1
@entity2 scored one and set up @entity6 as the dream pairing *clicked* at the @entity19
@entity45 and substitute @entity59 scored the other goals for @entity4
@entity64 needs extra time to see off second - tier @entity76 in the @entity77
