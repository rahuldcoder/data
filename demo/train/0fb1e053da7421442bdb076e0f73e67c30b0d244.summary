@entity0 -- @entity6 's actions toward @entity7 after the death of the @entity4 leader @entity3 were intended to show that @entity0 does not have animosity toward the @entity4 , president @entity9 of @entity6 said in a meeting with political leaders thursday			1
@entity9 told members of the governing and opposition parties that he believed @entity15 had probably not expected @entity6 to take such measures toward the @entity4			2
@entity0 expressed its sympathy to the @entity4 people through a statement on tuesday , a day after @entity15 's state - run media announced the death of @entity3			1
@entity6 also said that while it would not send an official delegation to the @entity4 , it would allow a limited number of private groups to send delegations to the @entity4 if desired			1
it also announced that it would let civilian groups send messages of condolence to the @entity4 upon approval of the @entity30 in @entity0			1
@entity7 said thursday that it would welcome a private delegation from @entity32 , a @entity6 company with heavy investments in the @entity4 , to pay respects to @entity3			1
@entity15 delivered the message -- addressed to the chairwoman of @entity37 , @entity38 -- through the company 's office in the @entity4 's @entity41 some 45 kilometers ( 27 miles ) north of @entity0 , said @entity42 , a @entity32 spokesman			1
@entity32 has held a working level meeting with the government to discuss the details of the trip , according to the @entity30			0
the recent moves have been considered a break from the hardline approach to the @entity4 that @entity9 's administration had taken since coming into office in 2008			0
it contrasted with @entity0 's reaction to the death of @entity15 's founder , @entity55 , in 1994 when the conservative @entity6 government at the time did not offer its condolences			1
" the swift stabilization of @entity15 's leadership is in the interest of all neighboring countries , " @entity9 said thursday			0
many observers see the recent moves as efforts by @entity9 to improve the soured relationship with @entity7 after tensions flared last year because of the sinking of a @entity6 naval vessel and the shelling of an island near @entity0			2
@entity0 demanded an apology for the sinking of the ship , which killed 46 seamen , but @entity7 denied involvement			0
and @entity15 said the @entity6 had provoked the bombing of the island , which led to four deaths			0
" the death of @entity3 can be seen both as a crisis and an opportunity , " said @entity79 - se , the chairman of the @entity82 's @entity81 and a member of mr @entity9 's governing party			0
" the decision that the @entity9 administration made to express its condolences , i think , reflects a choice to consider what has happened in the past but also think about the future			0
" @entity79 said he believes that by extending sympathy to the people of @entity15 , as opposed to @entity15 as a country , the @entity9 administration has found its own compromise			0
@entity9 's efforts with the @entity4 are much less advanced than those of the two previous governments , under which the leaders of the two @entity105 held summit talks in @entity7 , @entity79 said , but noted that @entity9 has made the first step toward improving what had become a tense , cold relationship between the two capitals			2
public opinion in the @entity6 is divided on whether it is appropriate to pay respects to @entity3			1
critics have called for a more proactive approach by @entity9 , suggesting that sending condolences to the @entity4 people was too indirect			2
some @entity6 argue that now is the time for @entity0 to seize an opportunity to make a breakthrough in @entity4 relations , while others say the idea of paying respects to the dictator is out of the question			1
" we do n't pay respects in the @entity6 to someone who has committed atrocities , why are we even discussing this issue ? " an internet user posted on an online message board under the username hwachon11_1			2
" i know there 's a lot of debate about the issue , but i think we need to see the @entity4 as a nation that we want to reunify with " a person using the name brit4men posted on the same message board			0
" i think it 's only appropriate we send a delegation			0
