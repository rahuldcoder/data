-- even if @entity1 and @entity3 negotiators manage to meet the november 24 deadline for a nuclear agreement with @entity3 , @entity1 faces a very inconvenient reality in the @entity7 : we 're stuck in a kind of @entity7 @entity10 where messy outcomes are more likely than neat solutions , and where ambiguity and uncertainty will rule over clarity and stability for years to come			1
and we better get used to it			1
part of the problem , of course , is us			1
we sit thousands of miles away , in a protected cocoon with nonpredatory neighbors to our north and south and fish to our east and west -- what one historian brilliantly called our liquid assets			2
and while this physical detachment is a wondrous advantage , it has also given us a very skewed view of the world			1
we may have freed ourselves from the dark forces of history and geography			1
but the rest of the world has n't			1
just ask the @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity3 , @entity42 , @entity43 or many others			2
for a start , our skewed view contributes to our naivete because we no longer really understand the mentality of the small power who lives in the bad neighborhood on the knife 's edge			1
it also explains our arrogance , because we really do n't have to listen			2
our margin for error is very wide given our size , power and protected status , which helps explain our idealism and why we somehow believe we can and should find those solutions			2
finally , our location informs our pragmatism , and the sense that somehow we can develop answers to these problems based on our own @entity68 , happy ending and heroic view of the world			1
i 'm sure you remember " @entity74 " under the last president -- and the campaign he launched to turn @entity77 and @entity78 into functioning democracies			2
yet 11 years later , and we 're now heading into @entity80 even our current president believed that the @entity82 required the @entity1 to get on the right side of history by acquiescing in former @entity42 president @entity86 's downfall			1
but @entity42 today is arguably less free and prosperous than under @entity86			2
and let 's not forget president @entity89 's words about " ultimately defeating @entity90			2
" let 's get real			2
even though we killed @entity92 and dismantled @entity94 's central core , the gravest threat to our security right now is n't isis at all but an affiliate of an @entity94 we were supposedly to have destroyed , @entity98 ( @entity98 )			2
these groups emerge from the poisonous environment that is now the @entity7			0
in order to defeat them permanently , we 'd have to fix the entire region			1
we ca n't do that			0
and now we come to the inconvenient truth			0
the @entity7 is a broken , angry , dysfunctional region ( just make it bad for short			1
) with the exception of @entity107 and perhaps @entity110 -- both still works in progress -- and several of the @entity109 kings , the @entity109 world is melting down			1
it is now , and will be for a good deal longer , marked by civil war			0
it is dysfunctional , and it is made up of largely failed or failing states that lack good governance , respect for rule of law , gender equality , transparency , accountability and respect for freedom of conscience			0
some argue that more time is required -- they urge us not to judge prematurely			0
but even the longer term trend lines do n't look good			0
where are the leaders who are capable and willing to rise above their narrow partisan , sectarian affiliations to govern in the interests of a nation as whole ? where are the institutions that reflect the popular will , inclusiveness and legitimacy of the public ? and where is the good governance that seeks to deliver freedom , security and economic prosperity ? ultimately , where are the moderates within the @entity109 @entity152 world who will denounce , fight and marginalize the extremists who have corrupted their religion ? the politically incorrect read on all of this is that this part of the world just is n't ready for prime time			1
indeed , there is not a single issue that appears on the verge of a sustainable solution			0
and there wo n't be for some time to come			0
@entity43 - @entity166 peace ? to do that , you need leaders , real ownership and decisions to close the yawning gaps on the big issues			0
but right now , there are n't any of those things in sufficient quantities			0
what about @entity77 ? that remains a country whose future is extremely uncertain as corruption , sectarianism , and regionalism threaten to pull it apart			0
@entity186 ? right now it is a veritable black hole with at least four subconflicts : @entity90 vs. @entity1 ; @entity189 vs. the so - called moderate @entity191 opposition ; jihadis vs. jihadis ; and sooner rather than later , perhaps , @entity194			1
what kind of @entity186 all of these tensions will produce is simply unknowable			0
suffice it to say , a unified , democratic state where everyone lives in peace and harmony will likely not be one of them			0
the fact is that more progress has been made on the @entity1 - @entity3 nuclear issue than all of these other issues			1
and yet even here should a deal be reached , the politics , lack of trust , conflicts on so many other regional issues , and challenges of implementation will all but guarantee perennial problems between the @entity1 and @entity3			1
@entity1 will have its hands full in this region for years to come			1
and it may well be able to help shape outcomes to some of these problems that will further its own interests			0
but it must give up any illusion that it can somehow produce solutions			0
these are , by and large , @entity7 problems , and their solutions will need to be owned by those who live in the neighborhood			0
@entity235 opined in his classic song " @entity240 " that if you want to make a real change , than start by looking in the mirror			0
if the region wants to fix itself with @entity1 's help , that 's the place to start .			1

geography has left @entity1 with very skewed view of the world , @entity246 says
much of the @entity109 world is melting down , he says
@entity246 : @entity1 will have its hands full in the region for years to come
