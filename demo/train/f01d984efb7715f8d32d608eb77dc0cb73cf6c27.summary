-- nicknamed " @entity7 " on account of her graceful running style and speed around the track , @entity2 's @entity1 is one of the greatest female sprinters of modern times , and also the most troubled			2
@entity1 : the " @entity10 " of athletics			2
born on the @entity2 - governed island of @entity13 , she was introduced to sprinting by her school gym teacher who , the first time she saw her run , was apparently so surprised by the girl 's speed over 100 meters she asked her to do it again because she was convinced her stop - watch had malfunctioned			1
her long legs -- by the age of 13 she was already 5 ' 10 " ( 1.78 meters ) tall -- made @entity1 ideally suited to 200 - and 400 - meter running , and after her move to @entity22 in 1984 , aged 16 , her potential was swiftly spotted			1
her competitive career got off to an uncertain start when she was disqualified from her first major tournament -- the @entity29 -- for stepping out of lane			2
thereafter , however , her trajectory was inexorably upwards			0
although she only reached the 200 - meter quarterfinals in her first @entity34 appearance -- in 1988 , in @entity35 -- four years later , in @entity36 , she swept all before her , beating defending champion @entity39 by two meters to win the 400 - meter gold in 48.83 seconds			1
she successfully defended her title in @entity42 in 1996 , holding off @entity44 's @entity43 in a thrilling final to win in 48.25 seconds , an @entity34 record and the third fastest women 's 400 - meters time ever posted			1
in the process she became the first athlete , male or female , to retain an @entity34 400 - meter title			1
controversy and illness three nights later she made history again by winning the 200 meters -- in 22.12 seconds			0
no other runner in a non-boycotted @entity34 had ever before won both 200 - and 400 - meter titles in the same games , although @entity61 's @entity60 emulated her feat 20 minutes later			1
despite her enormous success on the track , @entity1 's career has been dogged by controversy and illness			0
she has had a number of highly publicized run - ins with the @entity2 athletics authorities , and is renowned for her obsession with privacy ( she has been dubbed " the @entity10 of athletics " )			1
in 1998 she has diagnosed with @entity75 disease , or @entity76			0
in 2000 she caused a scandal by storming out of the @entity78 where her showdown with archrival @entity43 had been one of the most highly - anticipated races of the @entity59			1
@entity43 went on to win the title			2
since @entity84 has not raced competitively			0
after a planned comeback at the 2003 world championships in @entity22 was aborted because of injury , she had been tipped to stage a comeback at @entity89 , only to kill those rumors in an interview with @entity2 television in june			0
" i have finally decided to hang up my spikes , " said @entity1			0
" i am going to finally discover a real life , an everyday sort of life			0
i feel euphoric and very excited			0
