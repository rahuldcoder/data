@entity0 is a legal analyst on @entity2 's " @entity1			0
" @entity5 private eye @entity3 represented himself at his federal trial			1
the jury 's still out			0
@entity8 ( @entity2 ) -- there 's a courthouse adage : a person who represents himself has a fool for a client			0
when a defendant utters those tragic words , " i 'm going to represent myself , " judges blanch , attorneys snicker , and even the court reporters grimace			2
i 've been on the opposite side of those who have chosen to represent themselves			2
since 1975 , when the @entity25 @entity24 held that the @entity33 " grants to the accused personally the right to make his own defense , " many defendants have decided to take the law literally into their own hands			2
the most recent self - represented " client " is @entity3 , the @entity5 private investigator who 's been on trial for 78 counts lodged against him and two co-defendants			1
@entity3 's jury has been out for a week , so it 's not yet clear whether the outcome of his case will follow the conventional wisdom			1
the 64 - year - old celebrity sleuth is accused of leading a criminal enterprise that raked in more than $ 2 million by illegally spying , allegedly using wiretaps and law enforcement databases , on @entity5 's rich and famous			1
he then dished the dirt to their rivals			2
if convicted of leading a criminal conspiracy , known as a @entity52 charge , he could spend up 20 years to life in prison			0
@entity52 , by the way , stands for the @entity52			0
it 's the law the @entity57 used to bring down the mob			0
prosecutors have to prove that @entity3 and his co-defendants ran a corrupt enterprise that profited from information they obtained illegally			1
@entity25 district judge @entity64 granted @entity3 's request to represent himself , but she was n't too happy about it			1
" if the @entity25 @entity24 did n't require me to let defendants represent themselves , i would n't do it , " she said			1
even without a law degree , @entity3 seemed to realize that getting the jury to acquit him of the conspiracy charge was important			1
during his 15 - minute closing argument , he denied he led a criminal enterprise and insisted that he acted as a " lone ranger " while gathering information for his clients			1
he also told the jurors that he shared no information with colleagues as he conducted investigations and allowed others to learn only what he wanted them to know			0
" there was no criminal enterprise or conspiracy			0
mr. @entity3 alone is responsible			1
that is the simple truth , " he said , referring to himself in the third person			0
but unlike a seasoned attorney , he failed to address the evidence against him , including illegally taped conversations			2
instead , he bragged about his career , while wearing an orange prison jumpsuit , saying of himself , again in the third person : " perhaps his business card should read , ' i deliver , ' because he did it over and over again			0
" courtroom observers said his " cross-examination " often consisted of little more than settling old scores			0
so is @entity3 a fool , or absolutely brilliant ? well , if history is our teacher , he would do better if he had a lawyer , even a bad one			1
if you have a bad lawyer and you get convicted , you can always argue on appeal that your lawyer was ineffective and get a new trial			2
the following self - appointed lawyers learned the hard way that they had fools for clients : in fact , i ca n't think of a defendant who represented himself or herself as well , or better , than a lawyer			1
so maybe i 'm biased , but lawyers are trained professionals			0
we 're trained in the art of trial war			2
let us do our jobs .			0
