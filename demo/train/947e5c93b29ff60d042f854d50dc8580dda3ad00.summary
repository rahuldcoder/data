the flashing neon advertising signs and crowded crosswalks of @entity3 may not resemble the slow suburban settlement of @entity5 -- the capital of the tiny mountain kingdom of @entity8 in southern @entity9			1
but the two countries are now being linked by an unlikely dish : trout			2
thanks to @entity17 , and their operation 2,200m above sea level in the @entity20 , supermarket shoppers in @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity3 can now get their seafood fix from the landlocked @entity9 nation			1
" @entity8 provide ( s ) ideal , pristine environmental conditions for the farming of large trout , " explains @entity23 , managing partner of @entity24 , who has developed the @entity17 project since 2009			1
" water temperatures are close to ideal [ for trout ] for most of the year due to the altitude			1
" production started in 2012 with a haul of 500 tonnes of trout in the first year			1
during the current financial year , the company aims to produce three - times that amount			1
while the business says the @entity40 - bound fish are stuck on a ship for four weeks , executives insist the added logistics -- and extra costs -- are worth it			1
" the price premium that we currently receive ... makes up for any additional logistics costs , " says @entity23			0
business beginnings the production process starts with the fish arriving in @entity8 from @entity51 as eggs			1
they are then stored in temperature - controlled pens until they become " fingerlings " weighing around 10g			0
the baby fish are so fragile at this stage that the water quality is monitored regularly			2
once they become fingerlings , the fish are transferred to small nursery cages in the @entity62 -- @entity9 's second largest			1
in these more natural conditions , the fish grow to around 20cm in length and a weight of around 150g			1
they are then moved to larger " grow cages " where they live their last days in the mountain kingdom			0
through this whole process , which takes around 20 months , some of the fish grow as heavy as 2.8 kg -- lean fish meat fresh for sushi , soups and sizzling grills			2
and it 's the vast majority of these fish -- 85 % -- that will be gutted and loaded onto 40ft refrigerated containers and shipped from the @entity9 port of @entity82 to @entity83			1
the remainder is sold to @entity9 ( 10 % ) and @entity8 ( 5 % )			1
foreign inputs but it 's not just the fish that make a long journey to keep this business afloat			2
using materials and expertise from abroad has been key to the success of the project			0
specially designed cages have been imported from @entity95 ( which is also where the farm manager was based for 20 years ) , while most of the protein rich pellets the fish nibble on whilst growing come from @entity100			0
but not all aspects of this operation are imported			0
" we employ just over 100 [ local people ] on a permanent basis , " explains managing director of @entity104			0
" the bulk of the employees are directly involved with the growing and processing of fish ...			0
we have many employees who have never been in formal employment prior to starting at @entity17			0
" this is an important consideration in a country where 24 % of the population was unemployed in 2008 -- the last year records were collected			2
government estimates from figures collected in 2010/11 show that 57 % of the country lives in poverty			0
future fish while this might be a significant operation now , the project has had to deal with difficulties to get to where it is today			0
" the extremely remote area , developing a high - tech business with the highest levels of food safety certification , in a country where aquaculture and fisheries did not exist , presented plenty of challenges , " explains @entity23			2
and when the business is compared to the global market the impact is limited			0
expert @entity141 of the @entity142 describes the production figures as " very small " compared to other sectors			0
he explains that salmon production in countries like @entity95 and @entity147 " is more than 1 million metric tons per year			2
" but the @entity8 is showing no signs of shrinking in the face of the competition			2
" projected growth is ramping up by some 750 tonnes per annum , " explains @entity23			1
" expansion into a second dam in the @entity154 called @entity155 is in planning			0
" while @entity161 may not swamp the supermarkets anytime soon , their use of @entity8 's natural resources and remote mountain landscape could help the operation see some success			1

a company in @entity8 is *exporting* 85 % of its total trout catch to @entity40
the fish are reared in a dam 2,200m above sea level in the @entity20
creating @entity8 's first fishery has presented challenges
the company expects to grow its production by 750 tonnes per year
