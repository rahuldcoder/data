-- " what ? ! you do theater , you 've been a television anchor , you dance like you 're possessed at nightclubs , you emcee events , you interview celebrities , and you call yourself an introvert ? get out ! " nobody believes me when i say i 'm shy			1
sure , i thought i 'd conquered it			2
i 'd forced myself to get out of my shell , and speak to people -- i 'd even chosen a career in journalism that involved interacting with strangers			1
but nine years into that career , i found myself willing to brave helmet hair and the blistering summer heat of @entity19 ( officially called @entity19 now ) to ride a scooter to a meeting , just so i would n't have to ask our tenant to move the car that was blocking mine			2
and then it hit me -- you can get over shyness but the crippling tightness that paralyzes introverts is not conquerable			2
i 'm not sure how to explain the " tightness			1
" perhaps it 's unwillingness , not so much as inability , to communicate			1
it 's almost a mood , but with physical manifestations that clever folks may term " psychosomatic			1
" one shrinks from contact			2
it 's not the inability to interact , just a preference not to			1
as i analyzed this particular incident , i could recall several others			0
there are times i pretend i have n't seen someone i know , so i can avoid talking to him or her			0
these are not people i dislike ; i 'm even fond of many of the people i 've evaded			1
i do n't know why it happens			0
when i give myself a pep talk and push myself to go say hi , i can feel my heart beat faster , my nerves on edge , my throat dry up			0
yes , it 's pretty much how you might feel before asking someone out ; only , in this case , it was before asking someone to move a car			1
so , we all have our complexes			0
i got over " fat - girl " by losing weight and " unpretty - girl " by getting my face on tv , but how does one get rid of " shy - girl " ? especially when the only people who understand are the ones who suffer from it , and are hence unlikely to bump into you ? my teachers in school were baffled when i clammed up at extempore and elocution contests and was squeamish about debates			1
people assume good writers are good speakers			1
they assume stage fright is the fear of appearing on stage and hearing the sound of one 's own voice			1
but here 's the thing : stage fright is n't so much the fear of the limelight as the consciousness of the presence of other people			1
introverts are not always the kids with thick glasses , ugly braces and narrow shoulders , who spend all their time in the library or science lab. they could be popular in school , take part in extracurricular activities and have perfectly normal relationships ( just as long as they do n't have to do the asking out ! )			0
but , there are things they feel they simply ca n't do , things that seem to induce a stifling sense of lethargy in them			0
i suppose i had forced myself out of this lethargy every now and again , but i had n't thought about how i got here , or how i learned to deal with the onset of introvert tendencies , until the incident with the car			1
my " therapy " may have begun with theater			0
i loved the idea of bringing characters alive , and i knew how each line should be spoken			0
but i was terribly inhibited during play readings and hated " trust " exercises			0
i ca n't say i 'm particularly fond of them now , either			1
it was n't the corniness of it all , it was the constant contact , the idea of giving away personal thought and space			1
why did people have to know me when i was playing somebody else ? the problem was solved when i had one of those epiphanies that appear so " duh ! " in retrospect : that " somebody else " i conjured up in acting class was simply living her life , not acting it			1
i only had to be her			0
the corollary was that i could have a persona , one that would allow me to say out loud the wisecracks in my head , one that could hug people , one that could snuff out the sudden bouts of shyness that hampered my self - assurance			1
all it took was stepping out of myself			0
gradually , the two may have gotten integrated , because the persona was not different from me ; the persona just did what i wanted to do			0
and breaking out of my introverted inclinations to do those things gave me the confidence to do more of them			1
my second big step was moving abroad , and that leads me to wonder whether introverted behavior is cultural			2
oh , we @entity170 make a garrulous nation , but we rarely communicate			0
our natural instinct is to walk past strangers and look away quickly if our eyes happen to meet			0
we do n't make conversation with people who have a functional role , such as billing our purchases or filling our fuel tanks			2
they give us numbers , we hand them cash			0
on my second day in @entity188 , a cheerful cashier at @entity190 's spoke to me about his girlfriend 's parents , my course of study at the university , why @entity184 stinks and how my appearance was too indeterminate to reveal my ethnicity			2
strangers smiled and nodded in greeting			0
it seemed rather bizarre at first not to avert my eyes and pretend it had n't happened when i reached for the same can as someone else			0
but i grew comfortable with it over time			0
my big moment was sharing a laugh with a woman on the @entity206 , as her toddler screamed when one of the statue people moved			2
" trauma when he 's under 5			2
his brain 's warped now , you know , " i grinned , and she sighed , " yeah , i know ! " i moved on to a smile - and - wave mute - and - mutual flirtation with a tall fellow - jogger on @entity216 , which lasted several months -- till i spotted him in a blazer and realized he was a schoolboy			1
when i moved back to @entity170 , the list of " things i 'd rather not approach people about " was far shorter			2
but this is n't a finite list			0
you never know when the need will arise to pull your socks up and take a deep breath before asking someone if he can , say , move a car			0
the good news , though , is you can learn to deal with those few moments well enough to make people roll their eyes when you say you 're an introvert .			1

@entity236 says she 's an introvert though she does not fit the *profile* of one
@entity241 is a writer , a stage actor and a stand - up comedian
" i 'm hoping to reach out to other people who are as introverted as i am , " she told @entity0
