-- when @entity3 's aviation sector began liberalizing in 2003 , a regional powerhouse was unleashed			1
the country 's state - owned airline @entity4 was soon competing for passengers with six private airline groups in a market that has grown steadily in the past decade			1
in 2009 - 10 @entity3 airlines carried 45 million domestic passenger and 11 million international passengers , according to figures from the @entity13			1
fueled by @entity3 's stellar gdp growth and a growing middle class , passenger numbers handled at @entity3 airports exceeded 120 million , making it one of the ten largest markets globally , according to @entity13			1
but by 2008 , the sector was in trouble			0
debts mounted for billionaire @entity23 -- the flamboyant owner of @entity24 -- whose fleet of 66 planes , with a further 130 on order - faces losses of $ us1.62 billion			2
can @entity24 survive ? last week , @entity23 said he was on the cusp of some airline - saving deals , but investors have not been convinced and the stock has continued to slide			2
even though @entity23 says the airline does not need a government bailout -- and @entity3 's civil aviation authority has categorically ruled out any kind of lifeline for the industry -- the markets , and some industry analysts , say the sector will need a magic wand to reverse the descent			1
how did the tiger of the world 's aviation industry go into such a steep decline ? according to @entity49 , the chief correspondent with @entity50 , where once @entity3 aviation suffered from too little competition , now it suffers from too much			1
" there were just too many low - cost carriers and this created a situation where there are simply too many seats flying through air , " he told @entity0			1
" it 's a problem of over-capacity			0
" @entity4 has debts of more than $ 8 billion and @entity24 has debts of more than $ 2 billion			2
all of them are losing money with the possible exception @entity67 , " @entity49 said			0
@entity3 's aviation industry leaders lay much of the blame at the feet of @entity4 which they accuse of unfairly competing with @entity3 's newer airlines , slashing fares while at the same time enjoying the luxury of government subsidies			1
the airline has been unprofitable since 1997 and has received government bailouts of $ 625 million and is requesting more before the end of the fiscal year that ends in march 2012 , according to company figures			1
@entity4 agrees restructuring deal the national carrier employs between 50,000 and 60,000 people and analysts say the bailouts are likely to continue			1
" when the main state - owned carrier is in such dire shape then it tends to affect the whole of the industry , " says @entity49			0
" the carrier has been one of the main culprits in terms of discounting			0
" @entity95 , the head of finance at @entity97 , @entity3 's biggest carrier , recently identified @entity4 's price war as a key factor for the problems in @entity3 aviation			1
" ideally , fares should go up when oil - import costs go up			0
that 's not happening and that 's why airlines are in this situation , " he said			2
have rising oil prices contributed to steep losses ? aviation turbine fuel ( @entity112 ) costs have soared this year as oil import costs everywhere skyrocket			0
but on average , fuel costs are around 60 % higher in @entity3 than in other countries			2
this is because of a mosaic of state taxes , some as high as 35 % , making @entity3 one of the costliest places in the world to run a fleet of planes			0
" the states are unwilling to give up a good source of revenue , " said @entity49			0
" combing that with rising fuel costs and this further cuts into the slim margins and yields on which these airlines already operate			0
" he said @entity3 's central government may soon be forced to address this problem if the country is to have a functioning aviation industry			1
" the government has already had to step in to back credit for @entity4 whose suppliers were demanding that it pay upfront before they would make deliveries of aviation fuel , " @entity49 said			1
with an @entity3 rupee last week dropping to its lowest level in history , recently hitting 52.50 against the @entity150 dollar , the pain is set to increase of @entity3 airlines			2
" when you add to that costs associated with catering , maintenance and landing fees , as well as low yields per seat , then the airlines are really struggling			0
" how competitive is the @entity3 domestic industry ? " with many airlines bringing prices down to below the cost of producing the airline seat , the government is looking at issues of predatory pricing , " @entity49 said			1
" yields are very tight anyway and pricing is seriously affecting the airlines			0
the government is looking at setting up a regulatory body to make sure that @entity3 airlines are operating on a proper basis			1
" is opening the sector to investment by foreign airlines a solution ? " no foreign airlines are permitted to invest in @entity3 carriers and three government ministries are now looking into ways to change that , " @entity49 said			1
" this would be an important change because investment by foreign airlines brings with it all kinds of advantages , not least expertise in airline management and other synergies			0
" at the moment , however , in this sort of economic climate , the airlines are having trouble attracting any sort of investment at all , " he said			0
" it really is an awful situation			0
" do @entity3 airlines suffer from a shortage of qualified manpower ? " the growth has been so rapid in the @entity3 aviation space , that airlines have had difficulties keeping up with the staffing needed in terms of pilots , maintenance workers and engineers , " @entity49 said			1
" not only are the @entity3 airlines pirating staff from each other , but @entity3 is very close to the @entity210 where airlines have no problem with money and no problem with pirating staff from just about everywhere			2
" what 's the solution ? " many of the government 's solutions will take a long time to enact , " he said			0
" @entity3 is still a very chaotic country and nothing happens quickly			0
" if @entity4 , for example , needs action from the government then it that has to go from ministry to ministry , from committee to committee			2
" it 's forced into a situation where it is not very quick or very agile in a market where speed and agility are everything			0

analysts believe too many low - cost carriers are to blame for @entity3 's aviation woes
many blame @entity4 and accuse them of unfairly competing with @entity3 's newer airlines
airline has been unprofitable since 1997 and has received government bailouts of $ 625m
