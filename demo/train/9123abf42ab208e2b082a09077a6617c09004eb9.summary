@entity0 -- they sleep anywhere they can find open space -- in conference rooms , corridors , even stairwells			0
they have one blanket , no pillows and a leaded mat intended to keep radiation at bay			1
they eat only two meals each day -- a carefully rationed breakfast of 30 crackers and vegetable juice and for dinner , a ready - to - eat meal or something out of a @entity22 clean themselves with wet wipes , since the supply of fresh water is short			1
these are the grueling living conditions for the workers inside @entity31 's crippled @entity30 nuclear power plant			1
they 've been hailed as heroes risking their lives by braving high levels of radiation as they work to avert a nuclear meltdown			1
but until now , the outside world has known little about the workers ' routine			1
tuesday , safety inspector @entity41 , who spent five days at the plant last week , spoke with @entity1 about the plight of the 400 workers staying in a building within 1 kilometer ( .6 of a mile ) of reactor no. 1			1
@entity31 officials ordered mandatory evacuations for everyone else within 20 ( 12.4 miles ) kilometers of the plant			0
the workers look tired , @entity41 said			1
they are furiously connecting electrical cables , repairing instrument panels and pumping radioactive water out			0
they work with the burden of their own personal tragedies always weighing heavily			0
" my parents were washed away by the tsunami , and i still do n't know where they are , " one worker wrote in an e-mail that was verified as authentic by a spokesman for the @entity61 , which runs the @entity30 plant			1
" crying is useless , " said another e-mail			0
" if we 're in hell now , all we can do is crawl up towards heaven			0
" but they are doing it all with the kind of determination required in a task with such high stakes			1
there 's no room for plummeting morale and the workers are not showing any signs of spirits flagging , @entity41 said			1
however upbeat the workers are , there 's no denying the conditions are beyond difficult			1
" on the ground at the nuclear power plant , the workers are working under very dangerous and very hard conditions , and i feel a great deal of respect for them , " chief cabinet secretary @entity86 told reporters tuesday			2
the workers spend three days on site and go off for one			2
they start their work day at 8 a.m. and go for 12 long hours			2
@entity98 was , a nuclear engineering expert at the @entity100 , told @entity1 tuesday that contaminated seawater brings potential danger " and they need to take all precautions			0
" particulates that land on the skin or are ingested " can be a constant source of radiation into the future , " was said			2
" you need to be very careful not to ingest any of that			0
" was said officials need to remove and store contaminated water			0
last week , three men who were laying electrical cable in the turbine building of the no. 3 reactor stepped in tainted water , exposing themselves to high levels of radiation			1
@entity61 apologized and said their exposure might have been avoided with better communication			0
radiation alarms went off while the three men were working , but they continued with their mission for 40 to 50 minutes after assuming it was a false alarm			2
they were hospitalized after it was determined they had been exposed to 173 to 181 millisieverts of radiation -- two of them with direct exposure on their skin			1
by comparison , a person in an industrialized country is naturally exposed to 3 millisieverts per year , though @entity31 's @entity136 has said that those working directly to avert the nuclear crisis could be exposed to as much as 250 millisieverts before they must leave the site			2
the incident also prompted further criticism of @entity61 and how well it is safeguarding the workers			0
@entity41 said the power company hoped to improve living conditions for the workers by moving them to another facility			0
@entity86 said officials also hope to find replacements in order to relieve the workers at the plant			0
until then , they will continue as the faceless heroes in @entity31 's tragedy , the nation 's only hope of thwarting further disaster .			0

the @entity30 workers are sleeping on mats
they eat two meals a day of prepared food and crackers
they are exposed to high levels of radiation
an inspector divulges *details* of their lives , says they are still upbeat
