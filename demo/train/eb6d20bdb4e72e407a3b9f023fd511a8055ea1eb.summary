@entity0 , @entity1 -- one of the bigger difficulties any first - time buyer faces is purchasing a car that does n't scream " first - time " to friends , relatives and co-workers , or indeed to the buyer each time they step into an ill - chosen purchase			1
a " shark " that races down roads			0
to break from the boring econobox , here are some of the more sculpted and stylish cars available for about $ 20,000 that will hold their looks for a long time and give a little bit of joy to a first - time owner			1
@entity23 if you did n't know already , @entity23 means " shark " in @entity25 , and it 's not hard to see how @entity23 's sporty coupe can stalk the unwary first - time buyer and snare them quickly			1
like an instantly recognizable dorsal fin , the @entity23 in its third incarnation is perhaps the purest low - slung sportster that wo n't bust a first - time buyer 's wallet , though it may chew a hole in the seat of their pants as they 're pushed back into those tight - hugging bucket seats			1
the startling @entity23 - designed looks boast a touch of @entity44 styling uncommon for its bracket			1
@entity46 a bona - fide pocket rocket , any first - time buyer can put a fair distance between themselves and the pack in the @entity46 , part of the @entity54 carmaker 's strategy to wrestle performance compact coupe sales from @entity57 carmakers			1
this one is n't overbearingly dripped in trim or wings , but do n't let any youngster tell you it does n't have what it takes to make their peers jealous			1
the @entity46 will storm from standing to a mile a minute in under six seconds and is said to hit 155 mph			0
its secret is torque negation in the low gears -- and perhaps its 263 horses under the hood			2
another hidden gem is its seven - speaker @entity75 stereo			2
@entity77 much like the fantastic @entity80 , its younger sister @entity78 boasts highly sprung motoring at a price that appeals to the first - time buyer 's wallet			1
the @entity85 has been tweaked just slightly from its sister ss -- like the difference between @entity88 and @entity89 -- boasting a less horizontal grille and more sculpted valance			0
both are reasonably stylish from the back and side and both leaving plenty room for aftermarket add - ons			2
a new grille entirely , like a @entity98 , may just be what you need to set it off against the crowd			0
the @entity85 's inline - four 2.4 - liter 173 - hp engine -- 25hp over the base -- drives the front wheels to hit 0 - 60 mph in 7.5 seconds			1
gas mileage is good and customer satisfaction ratings are off the hook			0
@entity109 a revamped chassis is the key to why @entity113 's @entity112 has become an outstanding product at a price that 's hard to beat			2
a tweak to the iconic lines for last year included a smaller back window and a longer , craggier front end			0
some might of course call us heretics for picking a @entity109 over the famous eight - cylinder included in the @entity85 package but , to be honest , the @entity109 performs admirably , pushes out 210hp and emits a low - down growl that sounds wonderful			1
and it 's still a @entity112			2
civic coupe a civic hatch was my second car ( after a very short - lived @entity130 )			2
the coupe tested earlier this year brought back fond memories of the @entity134 's surprisingly roomy front cabin , its enjoyable handling and maneuverability , first - class economy and its sporty elongated hood and swooping back end			1
standard features include a 350 - watt premium sound system , a touch - screen satellite - navigation system whose screen flips to reveal the cd player , and a slot for a computer memory card			2
it 's also got a funky dash that spectrally lights at night -- what fun			0
@entity152 on the heels of its 2004 release , @entity155 's hipster @entity152 brand has remodeled its boxy wonder this year , this time boasting more than a design nod to its parent company 's @entity160			1
wide rear pillars , wraparound headlights and bumper define the second - generation variant , which comes dripping with gadgetry inside , as well as leaving plenty of room for after - market customization			1
this one turns heads while allowing you to pack five adults in relative comfort			0
other notable features include a central console that fits in a dvd player alongside a backlit gps sat - nav system that lights up in any one of 10 colors			0
@entity181 a co-worker bought one of these after crashing her old and very badly beaten up @entity184 on a left turn into oncoming traffic			0
so it technically was n't her first car , but for many buyers , it will be			0
energetic , filled with flair and boasting a vertical fold the length of its bonnet , the @entity181 looks the part as well as being colossally roomy inside for what you expect			0
you do n't get a third row of seats in there but , with the back row folded flat , it almost lends you to believe it can become a camper			0
other great touches include an mp3 input jack and reclining rear - seat headrests , while gas mileage is , as expected , very good indeed			0
