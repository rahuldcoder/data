@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 spokesman says the group 's phones and website were hacked , and text messages sent out saying their reclusive @entity1 leader @entity9 is dead -- a claim the group has denied			1
@entity9 is alive and the reports " are just propaganda against our leader and our mission , " spokesman @entity12 told @entity2			1
@entity18 said it has no operational knowledge of @entity9 's condition or whereabouts			1
this is not the first time speculation of @entity9 's death has surfaced			1
in may , the @entity4 forcefully denied reports that their leader is dead , dismissing them as " claims and rumors " from the " @entity0 stooge regime 's intelligence directorate			1
" at the time , a news report by @entity1 's @entity32 suggested @entity9 was dead			2
a spokesman for @entity1 's intelligence agency , the @entity34 , said in may that @entity9 had disappeared			2
@entity35 said at the time that he hoped @entity9 was dead , but could not confirm it			0
@entity9 was a rural @entity38 cleric when he became a leader of a group of students -- or " @entity4 " -- who took over @entity1 in the early 1990s and established a hard - line islamic fundamentalist regime that gave shelter to @entity45 and his @entity47 terrorist network			1
@entity48 killed @entity45 in may in @entity49 , nearly 10 years after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			0
the @entity51 led an invasion of @entity1 soon after the attacks , toppling the @entity4 and sending @entity45 into hiding			0
the secluded @entity9 refused to be photographed or filmed , and rarely traveled			1
he infrequently gave interviews and was thought to have met only two non-muslims in recent years			0
nonetheless what @entity9 said passed as law when the @entity4 ruled @entity1 , and to challenge him was unknown			1
those who had met @entity9 said he cast an imposing figure -- bearded with a black turban and one eye stitched shut ; the result of a wound suffered during a gunfight with @entity66 troops during their occupation of @entity1			0
in the wake of the @entity66 withdrawal , @entity9 created the @entity4 to overcome what he saw as @entity1 's descent into a lawlessness landscape dominated by warlords			1
his recruits came from the @entity38 schools within @entity1 and in the @entity1 refugee camps across the border in @entity49			0
driven largely by faith , they swept across the country			0
with most of the country under @entity4 control , he set himself the goal of transforming @entity1 into the purest @entity38 state in the world , declaring himself @entity85 , or head of the @entity87			0
while many ordinary @entity1 disagreed with his hard - line interpretation of @entity38 , others were willing to endure the @entity4 's excesses in exchange for the relative peace they brought to the territory they controlled			2
in building the perfect @entity38 state , though , he had little regard for the concerns of the outside world			0
public executions and amputations were common , and the @entity4 's treatment of women attracted much international condemnation			2
@entity9 vanished after a @entity51 - led coalition booted the @entity4 and their leaders from power in @entity1 in december 2001 for refusing to hand over @entity45 after the 9/11 terror attacks			2
his appearance has remained a mystery to many , and that presented a challenge to those on his trail , according to @entity1 president @entity115			0
the @entity51 government offered a reward of up to $ 10 million for information leading to @entity9 's capture .			1

the @entity4 says their phones and website were hacked , and @entity9 is still alive
in may , another rumor of @entity9 's death surfaced ; the @entity4 have denied that claim
the reclusive leader refuses to be photographed
he rarely travels and does not give interviews
