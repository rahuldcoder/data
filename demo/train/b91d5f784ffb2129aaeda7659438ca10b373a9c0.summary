-- two @entity2 legislators have put their names behind what they hope will be a class - action lawsuit aimed at @entity6 , who has come under fire for allegedly fabricating details in the best - selling book " @entity11			1
" the lawsuit , which also names @entity6 's @entity15 charity , was filed thursday in a federal court in @entity2 by attorneys @entity18 and his son , @entity20 , the latter of whom is a @entity24 member of that state 's legislature			1
the plaintiffs are @entity28 of @entity29 and @entity30 of @entity31 , both @entity24 representatives in @entity2			0
@entity18 , a @entity33 - based attorney , said the intent is to eventually open up the suit to anyone who 'd bought a book by @entity6 or donated to the @entity2 - based charity he heads			1
he said the two plaintiffs hope is to collect money , should the lawsuit prevail , and use it to spur educational efforts in @entity43 , as the charity has purported to do			1
" people now realize they were deceived : they bought books and gave money based on false pretenses , " @entity18 said friday			0
" ( the plaintiffs ) want to try to get this money into a trust , and use it to actually build schools			2
" @entity6 shot to worldwide fame with " @entity11 : one man 's @entity55 and @entity57 ... one school at a @entity59 , " which describes his getting lost in an effort to climb @entity62 , the world 's second - tallest mountain , being rescued by @entity65 in the village of @entity67 and vowing to return there to build a school for local girls			0
the riveting story led to the creation of the @entity15 , an organization that works to improve girls ' education in @entity65 and @entity43			2
co-written with @entity74 , the book has become a international publishing phenomenon since it was published five years ago , spawning a sequel , two children 's editions and translations in 19 countries			0
the charity did not immediately respond friday to a request for comment on the proposed class - action lawsuit			0
it referred @entity0 to earlier remarks it and @entity6 have made , which deny that the fundamental stories behind the best - seller are untrue			2
the charity 's website also posted a statement from one of @entity6 's doctors , @entity96 , saying that the author has a hole in his heart that has led to chronic low oxygen levels in his blood			2
as of monday , an angiographic procedure that had been scheduled for last week had been postponed and @entity6 was at home on bed rest , where he was receiving oxygen but not allowed to use electronics , according to @entity96			0
several weeks earlier , when a critical " @entity108 " segment came out , @entity6 defended his stories and charity			1
he wrote , in comments posted on the @entity15 's website , that the @entity120 report " paints a distorted picture using inaccurate information , innuendo and a microscopic focus on one year 's " tax return for the @entity2 - based charity			2
and two days before the piece aired , he wrote , " i stand by the information conveyed in my book , and by the value of @entity15 's work in empowering local communities to build and operate schools that have educated more than 60,000 students			2
" yet the lawsuit filed this week claim that both @entity6 and his institute " repeatedly fabricated material about his activities and work in @entity65 and @entity43 ... to induce unsuspecting individuals to purchase his books and donate to @entity15			1
" @entity6 " committed actual fraud " against the plaintiffs -- one of whom bought a book , while the other gave to his charity -- the lawsuit alleges			1
" the conduct of @entity6 and @entity15 constitutes malice and / or other egregious conduct , for which a jury should award punitive damages , " according to the lawsuit			1
@entity18 explained that a federal judge will now decide whether the lawsuit can be a class - action , which would mean anyone who bought @entity6 's book or given to his charity -- even if they live outside @entity2 -- can join as a plaintiff			1
the lawsuit specifically mentions the creation of a " constructive trust " that would funnel money from the lawsuit to charitable works			0
ultimately , @entity6 and his charity could face a jury trial , based on the lawsuit 's claims			1
" we ( could ) could have our opportunity to present the testimony , and we 'll see what the jury says , " said @entity18			0
" we are convinced that the vast amount of what ( @entity6 ) said is false			0
" weeks before this lawsuit came to light , @entity2 attorney general @entity178 said in a statement his office is looking into the @entity15			0
the organization recorded income of $ 14 million in 2009 , the vast majority of which was raised from private individuals , many of whom may have been inspired by @entity6 's books			0
however , in 2009 , less than half of that money actually went to building schools in @entity43 and @entity65 , and $ 1.7 million went to promote @entity6 's books , according to the institute 's board of directors			1
@entity0 's @entity196 contributed to this report .			0
