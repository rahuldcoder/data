-- common opinion holds that diplomacy involves careful negotiation and an ability to bite your tongue			0
but what happens when the political situation in a country is so corrupt that you feel it is your moral duty to speak out ? former @entity14 ambassador to @entity15 , @entity16 @entity16 , former @entity14 ambassador to @entity15 , has gained notoriety as one of the few diplomats to ignore the wishes of his government and openly criticize the country in which he was stationed			1
" i was told before i went that the human rights situation [ in @entity15 ] had n't changed much since the days of the @entity24 , whereas in fact it had got much worse , " he says			1
" nothing had prepared me for the sheer level of brutality and the sheer level of subjugation of the people			0
" @entity33 's most populous country , @entity15 has been ruled by president @entity34 since the nation broke free from @entity24 rule in 1991			1
@entity34 is democratically elected but the elections have been labeled unfair by independent observers			0
two cases of torture that were brought to his attention propelled @entity16 to speak out			1
in the first incident he was introduced to a man who told him that his grandchildren had been tortured in front of him in a bid to coerce him into signing a witness statement that would implicate two of his nephews as members of @entity52 -- falsely , @entity16 claims			1
shortly afterwards he received an envelope of photographs of the body of @entity56 , who had died at @entity58 , a notorious detention center in north western @entity15			1
his body had been delivered back to his mother in a sealed casket			0
she was ordered to bury the casket the next day without opening it but she felt there was a religious duty to clean the body before burial			0
when she saw the condition of the body she took detailed photographs and sent them to @entity16			1
" i sent the photos on to the pathology department of the @entity73 , " explains @entity16			1
" the pathologist 's report said that his fingernails had been pulled out , he 'd been beaten about the face and neck and he died of immersion in boiling liquid			2
he 'd been boiled alive			1
" @entity16 says he has come across only one other case of complete immersion in boiling liquid but numerous cases of limbs being inserted in boiling water and that " rape , suffocation and electrocution " is exacted on " thousands of people every year			2
" @entity16 's claims are corroborated by respected ngos			1
in a report titled " nowhere to turn : torture and ill - treatment in @entity15 " , published last month , @entity92 concluded that torture is " endemic to the criminal justice system " in @entity15			1
" it is not a marginal problem caused by a handful of errant police or security agents but is practiced by police and security agents on a regular basis , " said the report			0
the nature of these cases so disturbed @entity16 that in october 2002 he made a speech to fellow diplomats and @entity15 officials at a human rights conference in @entity112 in which he criticized the regime and highlighted the " prevalence of torture in @entity15 prisons			1
" the speech had been approved by the @entity14 @entity116 but behind closed doors it was met with arched eyebrows			2
@entity15 had become an important strategic ally in the " war on terror "			2
the @entity121 loaned to the @entity122 gave them easy access to @entity125 during the 2001 invasion and the @entity116 was keen to maintain a relationship with @entity34			0
@entity16 was recalled to @entity128 for a reprimand			2
later , while on holiday in @entity131 he was again summoned to @entity128 where he was served with 18 disciplinary charges , including accusations of " hiring dolly birds " to work in the visa department , having sex in his office with local girls in exchange for visas and drinking on the job			0
@entity16 did not aid his cause by beginning an affair behind his wife 's back with a 23 - year - old @entity148 teacher turned lap dancer , @entity150			1
he makes no secret of his taste for the good life ; none of the charges levied against him held up in a tribunal			0
he was exonerated but the stress of the ordeal brought on a mental breakdown			0
he recuperated and returned to @entity112 but on landing suffered severe back pains and was airlifted back to @entity128 with a pulmonary embolism in his lung			0
he was eventually removed from his post in october 2004			0
in a statement the @entity116 told @entity0 : " the @entity116 's handling of this case has been scrupulously fair throughout , and entirely in accordance with its obligations as an employer , including its duty of care			0
mr. @entity16 was withdrawn from post because it was considered that he was no longer able to perform effectively the full range of duties required in conduct of our relations with @entity15			1
" he was subsequently suspended from duty on full pay pending investigation of whether there were disciplinary issues to answer			0
that investigation was put on hold on medical advice until the uncertainties over his health were resolved : thus it was not concluded			0
mr. @entity16 then opted to apply for early severance under the terms of the @entity116 scheme to reduce its staff numbers , and we accepted that application			2
" @entity16 does not believe that open criticism of regimes would hamper delicate negotiations with despotic governments			2
standing up to dictators often elicits more respect than a timid word in their ear , he says			0
" the idea that it is impossible to conduct diplomatic relations except by fawning and by showing a respect that you do not feel towards countries which behave very badly indeed does n't help at all			0
" there is an argument that diplomats are part of a more far - reaching international governmental strategy where their job is to keep the lines of communication open with despotic regimes and that the role of blowing the whistle on human rights abuses is already fulfilled by @entity222 and journalists			1
but @entity16 argues that this does not apply in a country such as @entity15 where most of the @entity222 have been expelled and local journalists risk imprisonment , torture and death if they speak out			1
" sometimes you find yourself in a position where you are actually the only person in a position to speak out against a totalitarian regime , " he says			0
in @entity15 , his concerns appear to have become reality			2
the @entity122 ceased its effective alliance with @entity15 in 2005 , nominally due to a massacre in may in @entity238 where several hundred civilians were shot dead at a protest , but in reality , claims @entity16 , because @entity34 had switched allegiances and formed a military partnership with @entity244			1
he continues to speak out ; he recently published a book about his experiences , " murder in @entity248 -- a @entity14 ambassador 's @entity251 of @entity253 in the @entity254 , " which is scheduled to be made into a film by the director @entity256 , and he continues to write and give talks on the subject			1
@entity16 may now speak out from the cold but it is apparent that he believes that his stance has achieved significantly more than he would have in twenty years of quiet diplomacy .			2

@entity16 gained notoriety by openly criticizing the country where he was stationed
the former @entity14 diplomat hit out at @entity15 's human rights record
@entity16 cited grandchildren tortured in front of *grandfather* ; man " boiled alive "
@entity92 has *slammed* the use of torture in @entity15 as " endemic "
