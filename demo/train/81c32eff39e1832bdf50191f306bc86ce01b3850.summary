" this is in stark comparison to the gruesome , vicious suffering that he inflicted on his two victims -- and the lifetime of suffering he has caused their family			0
" lawyers rush to save him after injection the @entity137 said it followed protocol , affirming @entity2 's " deep sedation " seven times before he was pronounced dead			1

defense attorney @entity44 vowed to look into how @entity30 came up with the " experimental formula of drugs it used			2
" the @entity201 joined in his outrage			0
" it 's time for @entity30 and the other states still using lethal injection to admit that this experiment with unreliable drugs is a failure , " it said in a statement			1
it called for @entity30 and other states to prove the reliability of the drugs or stop the executions			2
some drugs hard to come by now the quarrel over the drugs used in lethal injections is not new			1
executions have commonly been carried out with a combination of three drugs -- an anesthetic to render the inmate unconscious , followed by a paralyzing agent to keep him or her from flailing , then a third drug to kill the inmate , often potassium chloride to halt the heart			2
the commonly used anesthetic was once sodium thiopental , which can also be used for surgical anesthesia			0
its sole @entity96 manufacturer , @entity234 , based in @entity235 , suspended its production in 2009 and ended it for good in 2011			0
the company said it had never intended it to be used in lethal injections			1
@entity94 manufacturers of the same drug refuse to export it to the @entity96 for the same reason			2
some states then looked to pentobarbital , a powerful anesthetic commonly used to euthanize animals			0
but that drug has been hard to come by since 2011 , when @entity248 , its @entity250 - based manufacturer , said it would do its best to keep the drug from @entity96 execution programs			2
controversies in @entity254 , @entity255 new drug combinations were a focus of controversial executions this year in @entity254 and @entity255			1
@entity254 put executions on hold after the death of inmate @entity262 in april			0
@entity264 was part of the injection combination , and it took 43 minutes for him to die , @entity254 officials said			0
while state officials said @entity262 was unconscious the entire time , a media witness for @entity0 affiliate @entity271 in @entity272 said he uttered the words , " man , " " i 'm not , " and " something 's wrong " before blinds to the execution chamber were closed			2
his attorney , @entity278 , said the inmate 's body twitched and convulsed before he died			0
the state @entity18 said an " exploded " vein was part of the problem			2
" there was some concern at that time that the drugs were not having the effect			0
so the doctor observed the line and determined that the line had blown , " said @entity289 , director of the @entity290			2
in january , @entity255 used a midazolam - hydromorphone combination to execute convicted murderer and rapist @entity296			2
it took 24 minutes for him to die , and he appeared to gasp and convulse for 10 to 13 minutes , @entity298 reporter @entity297 said			0
@entity255 's correction department said it had wanted to use pentobarbital , but it ran out of its supply in september			0
combining new drugs in lethal injections may have sparked controversy , but the use of the old drug combination that included sodium thiopental was also not fail - safe , medical critics have said			1
it is possible that executions were quicker and inmates flailed less with the old combination , but they may have been conscious as they experienced their executions , some critics say			0
the real question to some is not if a specific drug is responsible for suffering , but if the method of execution itself is			2
