" no one likes closing schools			2
it 's tough on families , and it 's certainly tough on our community , " superintendent @entity11 said thursday			2
" closing schools and making the remaining schools much stronger academically is unquestionably the right thing to do			2
we were operating far too many schools , " he said			2
he said the district was only using about 60 percent of the seats in its elementary schools , 40 percent in its middle schools and an even smaller percentage in its high schools			2
after weeks of contentious debate and years of dwindling enrollment , a divided @entity30 voted wednesday night to approve what @entity11 calls the " right - size " plan			1

i do n't feel my children will be safe , " @entity47 told @entity0 affiliate @entity48			0
" i feel like i have nothing , i have no high school legacy			2
i feel like i have nothing , nothing to go back to , " said prince @entity52 , a senior , who will be part of the final graduating class at @entity55			0

are your schools having trouble ? share your story @entity11 said the closures were the first phase of " right - sizing " a district where enrollments have plummeted from more than 35,000 in the 1999 - 2000 school year to about 17,000 in 2009 - 10			1

" keeping all of the schools open with too few children in them is draining the resources we need to improve the education of all students			0
" but four of the nine board members disagreed with @entity11			0
