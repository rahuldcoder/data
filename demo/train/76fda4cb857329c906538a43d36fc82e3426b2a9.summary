@entity0 , @entity1 -- the rallies are over , the students have been sent home and the people of @entity0 braved searing heat and impenetrable traffic to select a new president friday from a field of six candidates			1
despite the assertion by some residents here that it does n't matter who wins -- all of the candidates have been vetted by @entity18 ayatollah @entity17 and are likely to continue the anti-western policies that have formed his world view since he came to power in 1989 -- a feeling of excitement has been notable here			1
part of the sense of excitement may have nothing to do with politics -- instead , it could be because many residents began their weekend at noon thursday			1
the bazaars visited by @entity2 were thronged with people			1
but that would n't explain the presence in recent days of thousands of people -- some of them lured by sweets handed out by organizers -- at rallies for the various candidates			1
many of them expressed their views , including complaints , to @entity2 reporters as government security agents hovered nearby			2
what 's at stake in @entity1 's presidential election ? at a rally for @entity54 , a hard - line candidate and the nation 's chief nuclear negotiator , men and women attended in separate groups , the women 's heads and bodies covered by the loose robe favored by some @entity62			1
" death to @entity64 ! death to @entity69 ! " chanted the crowd when @entity54 spoke of a nuclear scientist who had been killed			1
but the sentiment appeared more political than personal			2
afterward , approached by a reporter they recognized to be from the @entity64 , many of the participants appeared welcoming and eager to talk			2
" i do n't have a problem with the people of the @entity64 , " said one person			2
" but i have a problem with people who trample on our inalienable rights to nuclear power			1
" the unifying impact of @entity1 's nuclear program is hard to underestimate : a nuclear symbol appears on the ubiquitous 50,000 rial note , which is worth about $ 1.50 , and many here say that it 's their country 's right to pursue a nuclear program			1
report : @entity1 takes key step in nuclear reactor construction @entity0 says that program is intended solely for peaceful purposes ; officials from the @entity64 and some other @entity99 nations say they suspect @entity1 is seeking to join the elite club of nations with nuclear arms and have imposed international sanctions to dissuade @entity0 from doing so			1
state - run @entity104 said 285 polling stations had been set up overseas for @entity1 abroad			2
at the campaign headquarters for moderate candidate @entity109 , his campaign manager told @entity2 that @entity109 would be open to talking to the @entity64 about such matters			2
" i think he would do it , " @entity111 said as a number of supporters buzzed around him			2
" but it does n't mean right away			2
" though thousands of fliers supporting various candidates littered rally sites on wednesday , nearly all of the election signs had been taken down on thursday -- in compliance with the law ordering an end to electioneering a day before the nation 's 66,000 polling stations open			1
a few posters extolling the candidacy of the popular mayor of @entity0 , @entity130 , remained affixed to walls in the capital			0
" i 'm for him because the sanctions are hurting us so badly , and i know he can fix them , " one person said , citing @entity135 's economic platform			0
at one rally , a group of conservative women said they did not like any of the candidates and would not vote			1
another group , this one of self - described liberals , offered the same rationale for their plans to stay home			0
though a few expressed concerns about speaking publicly to a reporter , others appeared eager to talk			1
the election is being covered by 430 reporters from 40 countries , 15 % more than were here four years ago , according to @entity157 , head of the @entity158 of @entity1 's @entity159			0
if no candidate wins more than half the votes , the top two will face each other in a runoff on june 21			0
in the 2009 election , massive anti-government demonstrations erupted in violence , followed by reports of dozens of deaths and claims of vote rigging in the re-election of @entity173 , who is barred from running for a third term			1
efforts appear to have been made to minimize the possibility of a recurrence of violence			0
college students , who played a major role in the demonstrations four years ago , were sent home when colleges were closed early			1
government officials said that that was done to give the students an early break for the summer			0
" foreign media reporters have expressed satisfaction with the government 's cooperation and praised the @entity1 people 's desire to participate in the election , " @entity104 declared flatly on thursday			0
several people complained about the sanctions and the struggling economy			1
in fact , prices for nearly everything have doubled since last summer			0
even the increase in the cost of watermelon , produced aplenty here , has outstripped inflation			0
by official figures , the inflation rate is 31 % ; observers say it 's more than that			0
and many here grouse that their costs are rising faster than their salaries			0
shrimp was $ 22 per pound at one store on thursday			0
according to the @entity218 , 15.5 % of the nation is unemployed			0
still , not everyone is tightening their belts			0
luxury car dealerships remain open -- with vehicles shipped here from other countries in the @entity226 , including the @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229			0
@entity1 presidential candidates ' cry for overhaul of foreign policy ' @entity2 's @entity234 reported this story from @entity0			1
