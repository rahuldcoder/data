@entity0 , @entity1 -- on monday , a @entity4 @entity3 officer shot and killed a 14 - year - old boy , @entity5 , under one of the international bridges that connects or , these days , divides , @entity0 , @entity1 , from @entity8 , @entity9			1
the boy lay dead on the @entity12 side and the @entity3 agent was removed from the scene by @entity4 officials			1
@entity4 officials say it was a case of self - defense			1
@entity12 authorities condemned the killing as the use of excessive force			2
the facts are still coming out , but based on the @entity24 and the @entity26 news reports , it is easy to see that the two sides do not agree on the particulars , much less on their interpretation			0
to people across the two nations who see reports of the death on tv or in the papers , it 's a dramatic news story -- a boy with a bullet in his head and an agent under investigation			2
but here at the border , the scene , the actors , the act -- as if carefully choreographed , chosen and scripted -- read like an up - close metaphor for everything that is broken with our border and with immigration			1
at a basic level , the incident at the @entity54 seems to reveal two nations moving ever further from acknowledging our inevitable common destiny			0
as the two countries face the economic call - and - response of illegal immigration and the drug trade , we seem to cast each other increasingly as enemies			1
in this context it becomes justified to deal with each other with violence : throwing rocks and shooting bullets			2
one could say that that boy represents the aspirations of many @entity12 people because -- whether , as some reports have suggested , he intended to cross the border or as others have said , was being used as a decoy for others to make a run -- the spot where he died is known as a place where people try to cross illegally in search of work and a better life			1
at the same time , a dehumanization plays out at the border , where some lives are worth more than others -- a calculus that usually runs along wealth lines , as those with money can afford visas to cross over the bridge and the poor have to stay out or risk their lives by crossing under it			2
additionally , the episode highlights the blunt instrument -- barriers and increased militarization -- that the @entity4 has chosen to deal with the countries ' 2,000 - mile border			1
thousands of @entity3 agents have been added in the past few years alone , and last month president @entity108 promised to send an additional 1,200 @entity110 troops			0
an ineffectual fence stretches in fits and starts along about 30 percent of the border ; it has been breached thousands of times , according to the @entity116 , and costs thousands more to patch			0
more fences , more walls , more armored vehicles and the @entity110 , more helicopters and drones , more sensors and infrared goggles , more cameras and guns , and thousands of increasingly armed agents are all part of the border 's choreography			0
from october 1 through may 31 , @entity132 and @entity133 agents have used their firearms 31 times , a spokesman told @entity2			0
in these circumstances , it is only a matter of time before more deaths occur			0
in this incident lies the inability of the @entity12 authorities to protect their people and the apparently questionable practices of our own @entity3 , which , for one thing , sends bike - patrol officers to a well - known trouble spot and for another seems unclear about whether they can or can not shoot across the borderline			1
neither side seems to believe that we deserve much more than these poorly pieced - together strategies , which reflect failures of both the @entity108 and the @entity156 administrations			0
mr. @entity156 has been unable to face squarely the inequalities of his people : more than one in three @entity12 would leave the country and move in search of a better life , according to data collected for a @entity164 report			1
and the event speaks to the political inability of president @entity108 to coax @entity167 toward immigration reform -- to include an orderly flow of low - skilled workers , easing the pressure on the border itself and thereby acknowledging the continued integration of the two countries ' labor markets			1
now a @entity3 officer will have to live with the idea of having cut short the life of a young boy whose death , regardless of what he was doing at the bridge , means pain and sorrow for a family likely under the stress of 30 months of outrageous drug - related violence in @entity8			2
it is mindboggling to think that $ 50 billion a year in trade makes its way back and forth over the bridges that divide @entity0 and @entity8 , but bullets and rocks are now traded right under them			0
so , we have to ask : is that what we want the future of our border to be ? an incident such as this should not spur us to finger pointing but to acknowledging that we have a problem ; that we desperately need to sit down to order and shape our interactions and take joint control of our future			0
if we forget or justify this incident , we will be condemning ourselves to many more like it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			2

@entity210 says shooting of a teen by @entity4 border agent is metaphor for broken *system*
as @entity4 - @entity12 grapple with immigration , drugs , they begin to face each other as enemies
increased militarization at border does *n't* help , but feeds potential for violence , he says
@entity230 : is this what we want for border ? countries must tackle immigration , border *policies*
