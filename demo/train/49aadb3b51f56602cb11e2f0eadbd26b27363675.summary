-- the leaders of @entity2 and the @entity3 are huddling in @entity4 on thursday over how to handle the @entity6 civil war , the raging conflict that has left an estimated 80,000 people dead and a few million displaced -- despite more than two years of diplomacy to halt the bloodshed			1
president @entity11 and prime minister @entity12 , meeting in @entity4 , discussed how to strengthen the @entity6 opposition , help the many people displaced by the war , and mobilize the international community to put more pressure on @entity6 president @entity19 and forge a political transition			1
they spoke as the warfare in @entity6 raged thursday			1
the opposition @entity23 in @entity6 said at least 63 people were killed , including 45 in @entity25 and its suburbs			1
" we 're going to keep increasing the pressure on the @entity19 regime , and working with the @entity6 opposition , " @entity11 said			1
" the prime minister has been on the forefront of the international effort to push for a transition to a democratic @entity6 without @entity19			1
and @entity2 is going to play an important role as we bring representatives of the regime and opposition together in the coming weeks			0
" @entity11 said he and @entity12 agree that @entity19 needs to transfer power			1
" that is the only way we 're going to resolve this crisis			0
and we 're going to keep working for a @entity6 that is free from @entity19 's tyranny , that is intact and inclusive of all ethnic and religious groups , and that 's a source of stability , not extremism , because it 's in the profound interest of all our nations , especially @entity2			2
" @entity2 has been a major player in the effort to push for change in @entity6 , which sits on its southern border			2
at one time , @entity12 and @entity19 had close ties , but the war has made them antagonists			2
@entity2 has long harbored many @entity6 refugees and hosted opposition entities			1
" i 've made it clear again today that the @entity3 is going to keep on helping countries in the region , including @entity2 , shoulder this burden , doing our part as a major donor of humanitarian aid to the @entity6 people , including those refugees in @entity2			1
and we 're going to keep working with our @entity2 partners to deliver the food , shelter and medicine that 's needed to save lives			0
" @entity12 said ending the war and meeting the people 's demands for a new government " are two areas where we are in full agreement with the @entity3			2
supporting the opposition and @entity19 leaving are important issues			0
" " we also agree that we have to prevent @entity6 from becoming an area for terrorist organizations			2
we also agreed that chemical weapons should not be used and all minorities and their rights should be secured			0
these are all priority areas for all of us , " he said			0
@entity11 said that solid evidence of chemical weaponry would constitute a red line in the conflict and produce major consequences			2
" i 've said in the past , we have seen evidence of the use of chemical weapons inside of @entity6			0
it is important for us to make sure that we 're able to get more specific information about what exactly is happening there , " he said			0
" but separate and apart from the chemical weapons , we know that tens of thousands of people are being killed with artillery and mortars and that the humanitarian crisis and the slaughter that 's taking place by itself is sufficient to prompt strong international action			0
" he cited a " whole range of options that the @entity3 is already engaged in " and said he preserved " the options of taking additional steps , both diplomatic and military , because those chemical weapons inside of @entity6 also threaten our security over the long term as well as our allies and friends and neighbors			2
" " this is also an international problem , and it 's very much my hope to continue to work with all the various parties involved , including @entity2 , to find a solution that brings peace to @entity6 , stabilizes the region , stabilizes those chemical weapons , but it 's not gon na be something that the @entity3 does by itself , and i do n't think anybody in the region , including the prime minister , would think that @entity3 unilateral actions in and of themselves would bring about a better outcome inside -- inside of @entity6			1
" diplomatic moves on wednesday , the @entity138 adopted a resolution calling for a political transition in @entity6			2
the resolution , which passed by a 107 - 12 vote , with 59 abstentions , also condemned the government 's increased use of heavy weapons and ongoing " widespread and systematic gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , " said a @entity151 statement			0
it was the fifth resolution on @entity6 voted by the body since 2011			0
" if we are unable to do anything to stop this tragedy , then how can we sustain the moral credibility of this organization ? " assembly president @entity159 said before the vote , according to the statement			0
meanwhile , in @entity165 , @entity3 secretary of state @entity162 and @entity164 foreign minister @entity163 discussed the revival of a peace initiative based on last year 's geneva conference			0
that conference , brokered by @entity164 and the @entity3 , outlined how a transitional government could be formed in @entity6			0
" i think it 's fair to say that both of us are confident about the direction that we 're moving in and very , very hopeful that within a short period of time , the pieces will have come together fully so that the world , hopefully , will have an opportunity to be given an alternative to the violence and destruction that is taking place in @entity6 at this moment , " @entity162 said			0
@entity163 cited the @entity164 - @entity3 proposal to convene a conference to start implementing the @entity187 communique last june			0
" it 's self - explanatory , and what we need now is to mobilize support for this initiative on the basis of what was , i believe , in @entity187 and what was proposed by @entity4 and @entity197 : to mobilize support , first of all , by all the @entity6 groups , the regime and all opposition groups ; and second , by those outside actors who have influence on either one or the other @entity6 group , " @entity163 said			1
@entity11 and @entity12 addressed the @entity187 initiative			1
" i do think that the prospect of talks in @entity187 involving the @entity164 and representatives about a serious political transition that all parties can buy into may yield results , " @entity11 said			1
@entity12 said that " we will continue to explore what we can do together , what we can consider as part of a road map looking at @entity187 and beyond			1
