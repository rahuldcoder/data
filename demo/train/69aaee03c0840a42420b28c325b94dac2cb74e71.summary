on monday , more than 2,100 firefighters were battling the wildfire that was still threatening hundreds of buildings and ancient sites on @entity19 lands in northern @entity3			1
the @entity21 fire has scorched more than 123,000 acres and destroyed more than 100 buildings , including 63 homes , according to @entity24 , an online interagency database that keeps track of natural disasters such as fires and floods			1

it had burned thousands of acres on the @entity44 and had spread onto the @entity45 , home to ancient @entity47 homes , rock paintings and petroglyphs , fire officials said			1
federal agencies also warned that heavy smoke and ash was making air quality unhealthy as far away as @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , and they warned the elderly , children and those with heart or lung problems to stay indoors , according to a news release from federal agencies associated with the firefight			0
since starting last week , the @entity21 quickly expanded into the @entity65 and @entity66			1
it spread rapidly because of strong winds , high temperatures and dry conditions that have similarly fueled dozens of other fires around the region			0
despite continued challenges , firefighters made some significant progress over the weekend			0
most notably , @entity77 county police chief @entity76 announced that a majority of roadblocks across the county were being lifted , allowing roughly 10,000 residents to return home			1

the fire has engulfed much of the @entity65 , the @entity96 and @entity97			2

at least one is assigned to each bulldozer and road grader , one of a host of measures taken to protect archaeological sites , according to the @entity124			2
the fire already burned over many such sites in the area , which is known for its native american history			1
the @entity21 fire is just one of dozens still burning in the @entity133 , especially in the @entity134			1
several of those are also in @entity3 , including the 100,831 - acre @entity137 fire , about 10 miles south of @entity138 , and the 10,250 - acre @entity140 fire , about nine miles north of @entity55			0
@entity32 said that a combination of " extremely dry fuels , " rugged terrain , strong winds and high temperatures have led to a " record - breaking year " for wildfires in the @entity133 -- and one that still has no clear end in sight			0
