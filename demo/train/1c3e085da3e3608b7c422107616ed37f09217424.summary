it 's a slick production with a nefarious goal : a 55 - minute video released by @entity3 , praising its victories and warning the @entity5 from getting in the way of its goal to create an @entity10 caliphate in parts of @entity12 and @entity13			1
it 's propaganda , terrorism experts say			0
a recruitment video aimed at @entity18 speakers			1
but the @entity5 intelligence community is focused on one jihadist who appears briefly at the end of the video			1
the @entity3 fighter , who speaks perfect @entity18 with a @entity25 accent , is shown orchestrating the mass execution of a group of men			1
it is too early to know if this militant hails from @entity25 , or maybe spent some time there , or what his exact story might be			1
but the intelligence community is already analyzing the video in an attempt to identify the man 's origin , a @entity5 official told @entity39			1
it is too early to tell where his dialect is from , the official said			0
in the video titled " @entity47 , " the jihadist first appears speaking @entity43 in a classical dialect and with the ease of a native @entity43 speaker , @entity39 terrorism analyst @entity42 said			1
but the @entity3 fighter -- who is masked and wearing a camouflage uniform -- seamlessly switches to @entity18			1
there are a number of men digging a ditch behind him			0
the jihadist claims they are @entity13 soldiers assigned to a @entity58 military base near the @entity13 city of @entity60 , and who now , after an @entity3 attack , are " digging their own graves in the very place where they were stationed			2
" @entity39 can not independently verify that the men in the video were soldiers , as the propaganda video claims			1
how the ' @entity70 ' is run , from oil to beheadings the video then shows a group of militants executing the men , who fall into the ditch			0
the man who committed this atrocity on film could be an @entity79 who was educated in the @entity81			2
or he could be an @entity25 or @entity82			2
if so , @entity42 said , he would be the first @entity25 jihadist to commit a war crime on camera			2
" clearly @entity3 had a calculated step to be able to put this guy on camera , " said @entity85 , a security analyst at @entity86			0
" why ? because he seems @entity25			0
the message is aimed at a @entity93 audience			0
" the intent , @entity85 told @entity39 , is to project fear to @entity5 , and to project power			0
the difference between @entity3 and @entity98 intelligence officials will sift through every detail of the man 's voice , looking for any clues of a particular dialect that might lead investigators to local communities to seek additional clues , @entity85 said			2
the @entity5 will also compare the clues of the jihadist 's language to see whether it is consistent with those individuals who are known to have gone to fight for @entity3			1
the video is undoubtedly propaganda and a recruitment piece for the terrorist group , @entity42 said			0
but it is also a warning to the @entity81 that if it gets involved in the fight , it will be a tough outing for foreign troops			0
the video does n't exactly goad the @entity5 and the @entity81 into launching attacks against @entity3 , but those who appear in the video try to convey a sense of toughness , @entity42 said			1
the video glamorizes @entity3 , according to @entity126 , which monitors terrorist groups			2
" it serves as not only a powerful recruitment piece , but a stern warning to their opposition about ' flames of war ' rising against them by the fighters , " according to a summary by @entity126			0
@entity3 , isil or the @entity10 state ?			0
