8 travel resolutions for 2013 @entity19 senior international correspondent @entity20 set his sights on @entity19 early in life			1
" back when i was , i think , nine or ten years old i read a book about @entity27 , how he traveled with his uncles on the ultimate business trip to the @entity31 at its height , " wrote @entity20 , who recently moved to @entity23 after an assignment in @entity25			1
" the trip lasted almost a quarter of a century , during which he grew up , mastered @entity19 , gained the confidence of the @entity37 emperor , @entity36 , and then eventually returned home with fantastic tales of strange lands and stranger people			1
" 12 months , 12 trips to make your friends jealous @entity20 socked away money from his first job delivering newspapers with an eye toward a $ 3,000 trip to @entity19 advertised in the sunday @entity53 magazine			1
" making around $ 30 a month , it would have taken me more than eight years to come up with the money			0
" he read about @entity19 in the meantime but spent most of his teenage years in the @entity58 world , where he learned the language and became interested in journalism , " for better or for worse , a busier profession in the @entity62 than in @entity19 , for example			1
" @entity20 took courses in classical and modern @entity19 while studying for his master 's degree and found it " beastly difficult			1
" he still wants to visit , in the spring or summer , he said			2
" @entity19 winters , when temperatures drop to @entity69 ( − 22 ° f ) are not for me , thank you very much			1
" he says he would hire a guide and horses and set out for the vast steppes			0
" i know it 's changed radically since i first latched on to the idea			2
for one thing it 's no longer part of the communist bloc , it 's no longer isolated , and its economy is growing rapidly fueled by a mining boom ( which is destroying the traditional nomadic lifestyle , and severely harming the once pristine environment )			2
" the price today with an upscale company is reasonable , he said , " compared to the $ 3,000 it was back in 1971			0
" " today the same trip is around $ 5000 , which though a still hefty sum , is , in terms of inflation , a steal			2
" @entity93 @entity0 senior international correspondent @entity94 spent much of the past year in conflict - ridden places that many travelers avoid these days , including @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			1
next year , @entity94 expects to travel to @entity101 , @entity98 , @entity97 , @entity93 and @entity102 in @entity103 , where he says @entity104 is putting down roots			1
so you 'd think he might like to spend some time on a secluded beach somewhere			0
he wants to travel with his wife and two daughters ( ages 17 and 21 ) to @entity93			1
" i have yet to take my children there and it is a very special place to my wife and i as we met there in the build up to the first @entity120 , " wrote @entity94 , briefly at home in @entity112 , in an e-mail			1
" the hotel we met in , which was the @entity0 hotel , at the time called the @entity123 , now the @entity124 , was attacked by @entity126 suicide bombers in 2005			1
" @entity93 today is becoming less stable and i would like to take my children there to visit places like @entity129 , the @entity131 ruins in @entity132 and @entity133 , the @entity134 and @entity135 where i learned to dive			1
my eldest daughter 's second name is @entity93 after the country ... so you can see the connection runs deep			1
" @entity142 , @entity143 work has taken @entity0 chief political correspondent @entity145 all over the world , but in her free time she 's " never been much of a traveler " beyond a yearly pilgrimage to @entity150 in @entity151 , which @entity145 calls " the place of my heart			1
" yet a few years ago , she was in a boat off the coast of @entity156 with her grown children , living out a travel dream			2
" i began to see massive areas of dark brown spread across the horizon of blue water			2
i never thought a dream i had since i was a teenager would come true , but there i was about to scuba dive and snorkel in an area of @entity169 , " wrote @entity145			1
" i love water , sea life , scuba diving and snorkeling			1
i love the warmth of sand just before it gets so hot you need shoes			2
i love a place with that spiritual feel of history and mystery			0
i love being with my children there to share			0
" @entity145 's got her next fantasy trip mapped out			1
" now i have a bank account with ' the @entity142 ' written on it			2
it 's not in the cards for 2013 , but i 'll get there			2
" i want to do one of those week long boat trips with the scientists on board who tell you what you 've seen , what you 're about to see because i think it will ratchet up the awe factor , if that 's possible			0
" @entity201 region , @entity202 @entity203 , a @entity0 correspondent based in @entity205 , is determined to visit the @entity201 region of @entity202			1
" this is my second time living in @entity202 and it 's something i failed to do the first time , so i want to make sure i get there this time , " wrote @entity207			0
" it 's the largest contiguous wetland in the world and teeming with animal life			0
most people think the @entity216 is the place to go to see @entity202 flora and fauna , but the @entity201 region is easily just as rich in animals and they 're easier to spot , especially during rainy season when rivers rise forcing animals literally onto islands			0
" the region is hard to reach and navigate , @entity207 said , with mostly lodge - like accommodations and boats , small planes and four - wheel - drive vehicles for transportation			0
but the rewards are rich			0
" there are an abundance of birds , monkeys , caimans , snakes , butterflies and fish out there			0
" @entity242 " there are some destinations that you know as soon as you step off the plane will change you			0
for me , it 's always been @entity103 , " wrote @entity248 , @entity0 's correspondent in @entity249			1
he has visited the continent three times but has yet to make it to @entity242			0
" as a journalist , i have long been fascinated with how @entity242 is emerging from decades of the racial divisions of the apartheid era			0
" but it 's one thing to read about those years and another to actually visit @entity258 , where @entity259 was imprisoned , or to walk in @entity260 , the area where thousands of black residents had their neighborhoods destroyed			2
" and of course , the country 's spectacular beauty is a big draw			2
" you can hit the beach , hike @entity269 overlooking @entity270 , take in amazing wildlife and cage dive among @entity274 sharks			0
" @entity248 would n't miss trying braai , the @entity242 way of spit - roasting meat over an open fire			0
" and if there was a cold glass of the excellent local wine or beer to go along with the braai , that would be just fine too			0
" where are you dreaming about going in 2013 ?			0
