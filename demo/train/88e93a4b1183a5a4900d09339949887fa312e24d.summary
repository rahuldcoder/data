-- at least four former @entity1 , those rugged actors of the famous ad campaign , have died of smoking - related disease			0
the latest was @entity4 , who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by a three - pack - a - day habit			0
@entity4 , the face of what became the best - selling brand of cigarettes , was felled by the lethal products he helped promote			0
years ago , he became a forceful voice for tobacco control , advising children not to smoke and working with organizations including the @entity16 to warn the public about the hazards of tobacco			2
@entity4 died a week before the release of a new surgeon general 's report showing that , despite decades of progress in reducing smoking rates and holding the tobacco industry responsible for its lies and deception , a tobacco epidemic still exists			1
about 44 million @entity30 still smoke , and one - third of all cancer deaths are caused by tobacco use			1
the report found that a staggering 6 million children alive today will die prematurely from tobacco use			1
it also found the list of harmful side effects and diseases tied to smoking is growing , including diabetes , erectile dysfunction and rheumatoid arthritis			0
fifty years ago this month , the first surgeon general 's @entity43 proved that smoking causes lung cancer and heart disease			2
former surgeon general @entity49 's landmark report launched a major transformation in the way people think about smoking and sparked a public health movement that has led to remarkable progress in the fight against tobacco use and the devastating death and disease that it causes			1
when the first report was issued in 1964 , the smoking rate in @entity30 was 42 %			1
that figure has been cut by more than half , to 18 % today , thanks in large part to proven tobacco control policies that discourage children and adults from smoking and protect nonsmokers from cigarette smoke			1
fifty years ago , passengers could smoke on commercial airplane flights , at work and in movie theaters			0
there were virtually no smoke - free restaurants			0
today , smoking is prohibited on airplanes and in many airports , and nearly half the country 's population is protected by smoke - free laws that cover all workplaces , including restaurants and bars			1
in 1964 , a pack of cigarettes could cost as little as 28 cents			0
the average price today is roughly $ 6.03 , an increase fueled in part by efforts to raise tobacco taxes as a proven way to discourage people from starting the deadly habit			2
the tobacco industry spent decades lying to the public about the health effects of its products and waging sophisticated marketing campaigns targeting children and low - income populations			0
as late as 1996 , more than three decades after the original surgeon general 's report , tobacco industry executives famously testified -- under oath -- that nicotine is n't addictive and smoking does n't kill			1
then in 2006 , a federal judge found the major cigarette companies guilty of intentionally defrauding smokers and potential smokers for financial gain			0
because the evidence established that the industry was likely to engage in continued fraud , the judge ordered the large tobacco companies to make " corrective statements " admitting their wrongdoing			0
the @entity124 and the cigarette companies last month agreed on the details of an advertising campaign that the industry must fund to air the statements in the country 's top - selling newspapers and on the major tv networks during prime time			0
the factual , blunt statements include " it 's not easy to quit " and " smoking kills , on average , 1,200 @entity30			2
" fifty years after the country 's top health official confirmed that smoking causes death , the industry will finally be compelled to level with the @entity30 people about the harm its products cause			1
we have a long way to go to end suffering and death from tobacco use			2
smoking will kill nearly half a million people in @entity30 this year and cost the country a staggering $ 130 billion in health care costs and lost productivity			1
we must seize this moment in history to renew our national commitment to protecting public health by passing strong tobacco control laws			0
the most effective ways to help people quit smoking and keep children from starting the deadly habit are by consistently and significantly increasing tobacco taxes , passing comprehensive smoke - free laws that protect all workers from secondhand smoke and fully funding programs that help people quit tobacco and prevent others from starting			1
lawmakers at all levels of government must make a priority of these policies to end death and suffering from tobacco use			2
without further action , tobacco use will remain the most preventable cause of death in this country , as it has been for more than half a century			1
for the sake of @entity30 's health , we ca n't afford to ignore this opportunity			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0
