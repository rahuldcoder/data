@entity0 , @entity1 -- three weeks after @entity4 plugged its crippled @entity6 oil well in the @entity7 with cement and mud from above , crews are " fishing " for pieces of drill pipe that need to be removed from inside the well 's blowout preventer before crews can move on to the " bottom kill " -- the permanent fix for the well			1
once those pieces of drill pipe are retrieved , crews will be able to replace the @entity6 's old blowout preventer with a new one awaiting use on the nearby ship , the @entity19 , @entity4 spokeswoman @entity18 confirmed thursday			1
meanwhile , @entity26 gov. @entity25 on thursday discontinued a state of emergency for the @entity28 ( @entity29 ) and 18 other peninsula coastal counties threatened by the spill			1
seven @entity33 counties -- @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity7 and @entity40 -- are to remain under an extended state of emergency in order to qualify for economic aid , @entity25 's office said in a statement			1
@entity45 , the man in charge of the government response to the @entity7 oil crisis , said wednesday that the " fishing " operations had been delayed by a buildup of hydrates -- chemicals that form at low temperatures and high pressures toward the sea floor -- that temporarily jammed the cap that trapped oil in the well starting on july 15			1
crews flushed the system to loosen the cap and began " fishing " through the top of the well again			0
@entity4 definitely plans to remove at least two smaller , cut pieces of pipe , but the status of a third , longer piece of drill pipe is unclear -- and that will affect how crews proceed , @entity45 said			1
he added that they are trying to determine if the third piece was affected by the cement poured into the top of the well during the " static kill , " process at the beginning of august -- and if so , how			0
crews are trying to determine what to do if they ca n't retrieve the third piece of pipe			2
they may have to try to remove the old blowout prevent with the third piece of drill pipe still attached , @entity45 said			1
the retired @entity84 admiral said wednesday he is " hesitant " to give out any timeline for the process until they figure out the condition of the third piece of drill pipe			1
crews need to replace the blowout preventer to ensure that the pressure inside the @entity6 well will remain at a safe level when they intercept the @entity6 well through a relief well at nearly 18,000 feet deep			0
" our first goal is to do no harm , " @entity45 said in a teleconference last week			0
investigators also want to examine the original blowout preventer , which did not work properly to choke off the well as it should have			0
once the new blowout preventer is in place and @entity45 gives crews the green light to resume drilling , it will take them about four days to prepare , drill the final 50 feet of a relief well and intercept the main well			2
then , the " bottom kill " process of plugging the well from below will begin			0
@entity45 has said cementing will require another several days			0
the environmental disaster began after an april 20 explosion on the offshore drilling platform @entity115 that killed 11 men			0
two days later , the platform sank and oil from the @entity6 well underwater started gushing into the @entity7			2
investigators do n't want the drill pipe to damage the blowout preventer because they want to see it " as is " to determine the blowout preventer 's role in the calamity			2
the government says 205.8 million gallons of oil escaped from the well before it was sealed on july 15			0
even though oil has not flowed from the well site since july 15 , seven panhandle counties including @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity7 and @entity40 are to remain under an extended state of emergency in order to qualify for economic aid under state and federal disaster guidelines			1
there have been no reported physical oil impacts to the @entity28 from the april 20 @entity139 / @entity4 explosion and subsequent spill , according to captain @entity141 , sector @entity84 @entity144 sector commander @entity2 's @entity145 contributed to this report			0

new : @entity26 calls off state of emergency for several peninsula coastal counties
crews in the @entity7 are trying to remove three pieces of drill pipe from the *sunken* well
the work was delayed by a chemical buildup that jammed the *entryway* to the well
once the drill pipe is removed , crew can move on to a permanent *shutdown* of the well
