-- how can a serious bluesman thrive in the age of @entity3 ? that 's the question @entity5 grapples with on his major label debut			1
since his teens , @entity5 has been the young titan of @entity10 blues , coming out of @entity11 in the early 2000s with a smoothly long - suffering voice and one hell of a mean guitar tone , playing solos that claw and scream their stories with ornery splendor			1
he 's a full - fledged guitar hero of the classic school			0
and that 's all he would need to be , if he only wanted to spend his career playing for roots - music die - hards and recording for his own @entity24 , the @entity11 label that released his albums from 2004 to 2010			2
but @entity5 , 28 , has a different trajectory and a much larger goal : to reach his own generation , the one that grew up on hip - hop and @entity33			2
@entity5 spreads his musical bets on " @entity35			1
" instead of having one signature sound , he tries a dozen , delving into modern r&b , retro soul , psychedelia and garage rock			1
a handful of the album 's songs are cherry - picked from @entity5 's @entity24 catalog , remade in studios that make everything sound bigger and tougher			1
abetted by producers @entity48 ( dr. @entity49 , @entity50 ) and @entity51 ( @entity52 ) , @entity5 is clearly aware that young listeners have heard the @entity55 , @entity56 and the roots			1
although most songs have a live , hand - played flavor , a few of them -- including the title track -- tilt toward the static , looplike grooves of hip - hop			0
videos : @entity5 plays new songs at @entity67 the album 's core is still the blues			1
@entity5 dips into the historical timeline , sampling a juke joint 's worth of 20th - century styles : from the rural slide - guitar picking of " @entity76 " to the desolate tidings and incendiary lead guitar of " @entity79 " to the cream - y riffing and layering of " @entity82 n't @entity83			2
" but @entity5 wo n't be genre - bound			2
" @entity84 " is pushy , updated @entity86 soul with @entity5 's fuzztone leading the charge of a horn section			1
" @entity95 ' " makes another @entity91 move with a fat @entity93 - style backbeat			0
as an album , @entity35 makes for a bumpy ride			0
the roaring , distortion - soaked blues of " @entity100 " -- which sounds something like @entity102 tackling " @entity103 " -- upstages the falsetto croon and string arrangement of " please come home			0
" the souped - up @entity108 boogie of " @entity109 " collides with " @entity110 , " which has @entity5 ruminating over woozy , echoey keyboards : " ca n't go on like this / knowing that i 'm just getting high			0
" @entity5 and @entity112 clearly expect listeners to carve their own playlists from the album 's 13 tracks			0
outside the structures of the blues , @entity5 is still a journey - man songwriter , sometimes settling for easy rhymes and singsong melodies , as he does in " @entity35 , " which aspires to the thoughtfulness of @entity123 , wondering , " how do we get lifted / how do we not go insane ? " give @entity5 credit for striving to be something more than a blues - rock throwback and singing from a troubled heart			1
and hope that he gets through the narrow portals of pop radio			0
but on this album , it 's still his blues that cut deepest			0
