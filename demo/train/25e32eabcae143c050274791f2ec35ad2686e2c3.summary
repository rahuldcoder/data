@entity0 -- when considering risks to their business , employers tend to worry about hackers or burglars , but the biggest threat to security might come from within			0
according to a study conducted by information management company @entity10 , a third of 2,031 @entity13 office workers surveyed admitted that they had taken or forwarded confidential information out of the office , and one in seven had taken confidential information with them to a new job			1
another 31 % said they would deliberately remove and share confidential information if they were fired			1
data breach is a common concern for businesses , but @entity26 , @entity10 's senior vice president for @entity27 , @entity28 & @entity29 , says they tend to focus too much on monitoring for attacks from outside , while " the people side of the organization and the hard copy are forgotten about			0
" " you can see who 's hacking in and taking information , but people do n't leave a trail , " he says			1
" therefore , if you do n't have good policies in place , it 's very difficult to work out what has happened with information			1
" although we may not always consider the data we work with day in and day out to be particularly exciting , @entity26 says that in any given business there are several functions that might use or create information that 's commercially valuable or subject to privacy laws			1
" hr or finance will have an awful lot of access to very sensitive information , " @entity26 says			1
" sales and marketing will have access to customer data , and some of the service organizations will have a lot of information about their patients or their customers			2
" see also : work skills you 'll need to survive the ' conceptual age ' of the workers who admitted to taking confidential information to a new job , half said they believed they had a right to take information , and most said they took information because they had been involved in its creation			1
although pervasive , this sense of ownership is misguided , says @entity26			0
" the information you create in your daily work does n't belong to you because you created it , " he says , " it belongs to the organization that 's paying you to do that job			1
" the study also revealed that most of those who had taken information when they left a job had relieved their employers of customer databases			1
see also : have you got the career x-factor ? this , according to @entity95 of @entity27 data protection training organization @entity96 , is " a dangerous thing to do			0
" privacy laws vary from country to country , but in the @entity106 , for example , any processing of information that relates to a living person is a breach of the @entity108			2
although some consultants and lawyers might be able to negotiate permission to transfer clients with them when they leave a company , @entity95 says : " if an employee took a database of customers without the consent of their employer , they are risking a criminal offense			0
" and if they did it to set up their own business , they 're also vulnerable for someone taking a civil case for damages			0
" besides , making a gift of illegally obtained information is unlikely to ingratiate you to a new boss			2
pounder points out that a new employer who knowingly receives personal data obtained in breach of data protection laws could also be liable for damages caused			0
so , what can businesses do to protect their data ? information management companies offer solutions ranging from encryption software to systems that allow organizations to track the whereabouts of files across multiple sites			1
but @entity26 thinks simply communicating policies regarding information ownership is a good first step towards alleviating the problem			2
" i do n't think you need to have security guards on the door every day , but reminding people of the policy , and auditing those processes , would go a long way towards managing information more securely , " he says			2
regardless of how information leaves a company -- whether due to malice , professional pride or as more businesses allow telecommuting -- @entity26 believes there is always cause for concern			0
even those who take documents home for entirely legitimate reasons and with their employer 's consent might be endangering security			0
" how do you manage information created on the train on the way into work ? " he asks			0
" and how do you manage that information thereafter ? if people are taking information out of the office , how do you know that information comes back or is securely destroyed ? " @entity26 predicts that , as the volume of information created grows , executives need to consider " not just the value you get from information , but how you protect it , because it 's a hugely valuable asset , but often nobody has responsibility for it			0

study : one in seven @entity13 workers have taken confidential information to new job
