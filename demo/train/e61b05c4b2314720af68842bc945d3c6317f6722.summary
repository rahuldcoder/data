-- " give the man his money			0
" that was the demand from @entity4 , my teammate when i played for the @entity6 more than 20 years ago			0
it was a saturday night and we were having one of our regular special team meetings , where we 'd watch highlights from the previous week and review the big hits and plays			1
@entity4 was calling for the $ 100 reward that a player had coming to him for an interception or forcing a fumble or , of course , the de-cleating big hit			1
it was 1988 and i was in the @entity21 that i was raised on			0
i dreamed about being a player in that highlight reel			1
in 1989 , in the midst of my second year with the @entity6 , we traded kicker @entity25 to the @entity26			0
several weeks later we played the @entity26 in @entity27 , and the night before the game i talked with @entity25 and reminded him " to keep your head on a swivel			1
" he knew exactly what i was talking about			0
days later , that game came to be known as the " @entity35 " and our coach @entity36 was accused of putting a bounty on his head			1
but it was nothing like that at all			0
no one player was targeted			1
the incentive was the big play that changed the game			1
the hit had to be a clean and legal hit			0
cheap shots , late or illegal hits were not only disallowed , they were met with boos			2
the money on the back end was merely ceremonial			0
for players making league minimum , it became a part of their service , like a tip to a waiter			2
this was the @entity21 i grew up watching , and i was playing with guys i watched on tv as a child			0
it was the @entity21 that gave us " @entity67 , " the " @entity68 " and the " @entity69			0
" bloody knuckles and vicious hits were the script by which the raw , orchestrated violence of the @entity21 was sold			1
when the revelations of the bounty that players of the @entity80 players had for their opponents became public , my first thought was the rate of inflation : $ 10,000 seemed excessive -- but so too does a $ 100 million dollar contract from someone of my generation			1
the big money makes the big hit seem more perverse			2
still , the whole thing seems rather routine to me			0
i must admit that when i first retired from football i did not view it as a violent game			2
while i had been aware of our society 's appetite for violent entertainment , the violence of the game remained inconsequential to the goal			1
but taking a step to the sidelines , i could now see the carnage of the game and modified my view			2
it 's impossible to get past the reality of the way the game has grown			1
big hits , big stages , big - time players and big salaries have characterized the growth of the game and its image			1
and , every player 's contract is loaded with performance incentives that work to raise the level of competition			1
it seems to me that the coaches and players of the @entity80 were playing according to the model given			2
listening to the indignation by the public and most especially the sports media world as they condemn the behavior of the @entity80 players and coaches , it 's hard not to hear some hypocrisy			1
to be sure , the league has presented the game over the years as a show of hard knocks , where athlete warriors wage their fight			2
and , young athletes , like i was in the 1970 's , grow up striving for that moment they make the highlight reel			2
the hits must be clean and the intent must never be to maim an opponent			2
however , as @entity145 of @entity146 put it , the intent is to physically and psychologically " damage " a player with a hit			2
as someone who was often the one being hit , i understood that quite clearly			0
today we are more aware of head injuries and the violent nature of football			0
but this game has never been sold as the " two - hand touch " most boys played in their youth			0
it 's common knowledge that football is not a " contact sport " but a " collision sport			1
" and , while we must do all we can to prevent injuries , we must also recognize the insatiable appetite we have for the violence -- and the subsequent reward , of admiration and dollars , we bestow on @entity21 players			1
we must also be honest about what we expect			0
this will not go away with admonishment from the media or sanctions from the league -- unless , of course , the media and the league stop promoting the violence and reward how the game is played when it presents it to the next generation			1
the tradition will not stop on a dime any more than a player can stop as he charges towards an opposing player at full speed			0
every football player has heard the phrase " reckless abandon			0
" that 's the way we were raised to play			0
@entity194 is a member of the @entity195 , a feminist and social justice educator			1
follow him on @entity197 , @ donmcpherson .			0

@entity201 says in his early career , *payouts* for " big hits " were common
he says the *amount* is far less , and no individual players were targeted
he says as a player , he did *n't* think of the game 's violence ; fans and players expect it
@entity194 : if fans are *appalled* by " bounty *system* , " they should lower their lust for violence
