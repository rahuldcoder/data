appearing on the @entity10 program " @entity13 " and the @entity12 program " @entity26 , " @entity1 said @entity3 is receiving regular briefings by his national security staff on the incident in which a suspect allegedly tried to detonate an explosive device on a @entity20 flight from @entity21 , @entity22 , making its final approach to @entity24 , @entity25			1
the suspect , 23 - year - old @entity28 @entity27 , was on a broad watch list of 550,000 names since last month , @entity1 said			1
that list does not automatically bring tighter screening of individuals , @entity1 said , and @entity3 has ordered a review of the procedures for determining which people on the list undergo more stringent checking			1
@entity3 also called for " a review to ... figure out why an individual with the chemical explosive he had on him could get on a plane in @entity21 and fly into the @entity8 , " @entity1 said on @entity12			1
" the president is very confident that this government is taking the steps that are necessary to take our fight to those who seek to do us harm , " @entity1 said on the @entity10 program			0
authorities on sunday focused their investigation on how a lone traveler smuggled explosives aboard the @entity20 flight and who might have helped him			0
@entity27 , who had a multiple entry visa to the @entity8 , was charged saturday in a federal criminal complaint			1

the suspect had a shoulder bag and went through the normal check - in process with his passport and @entity8 visa scanned , @entity95 said sunday			1

a family source told @entity0 that the elder @entity27 -- who recently retired as chairman of @entity130 , one of @entity28 's premier banks -- had contacted the embassy in @entity28 's capital , @entity135 , and various other security agencies earlier than the timeline provided by the administration official			1
the family source said @entity27 went to those agencies about three months ago after receiving a text message from his son			2

" @entity27 's information about his son was forwarded to the @entity156 , and @entity27 was added to a general watch list , a senior administration official said			2
but the official said " the info on him was not deemed specific enough to pull his visa or put him on a no - fly list			2
" in addition , the official said there was " no derogatory information that would have prevented him from getting a visa " back in june 2008			0
a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation into @entity27 said investigators are still trying to trace his past travels			2
" investigators are looking into any @entity173 connections and whether he had help and training from @entity148 , " the law enforcement official said			0
a preliminary @entity177 analysis found that the device on the plane contained @entity180 , also known as @entity180 , a highly explosive chemical compound			0
in addition , @entity177 agents recovered what appear to be remnants of a syringe near @entity27 's seat , believed to have been part of the device			2
the family source said @entity27 received a college degree at the @entity192 , where spokesman @entity193 said a man named @entity27 was enrolled in the mechanical engineering department between september 2005 and june 2008			2
when @entity27 returned to @entity28 from @entity102 , he told his family he wanted to get a second college degree in @entity198 , @entity199 , or @entity200 , the family source said			1
the family refused because they were worried that he may have developed ties to some dubious people			0
he went to @entity147 instead , the source said , where he sent a text message saying he had gone to @entity148 to start a new life and that it would be difficult for anyone to reach him because he had thrown away his sim card			0
@entity27 's father notified the @entity8 embassy with information on his son , saying the family feared he went to @entity148 to participate in " some kind of jihad			1
" a federal security bulletin obtained by @entity0 said @entity27 claimed the explosive device used friday " was acquired in @entity148 along with instructions as to when it should be used			0
" @entity148 authorities have yet to receive official information on the terror attempt , according to a @entity148 official who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media			0
but , the source said the country 's government will take immediate action once the attempted bombing suspect 's alleged link to the country is officially identified			0
earlier saturday , the @entity22 ' national coordinator for counterterrorism told @entity0 that @entity27 had gone through " normal security procedures " in @entity21 before boarding the flight and those were " well - performed			1
