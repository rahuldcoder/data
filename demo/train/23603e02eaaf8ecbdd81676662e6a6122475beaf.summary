-- after the horrific shooting in @entity2 , @entity3 , a parade of self - appointed experts tried to insinuate that people with autism are prone to inexplicable acts of violence because they lack the ability for empathy and social connection			1
this is because the shooter , @entity15 , had been diagnosed with @entity17 's syndrome , a form of autism			2
these speculations are needless , untrue and hurtful			1
i was diagnosed with @entity17 's syndrome when i was 9 years old			0
i had a lot of anxiety when i was in school , not because i have autism but because other kids would often bully and ridicule me			2
i was a smart kid , but i was very socially awkward			0
thankfully , my parents were very supportive and helped me get through many dark days			0
i have @entity17 's ; i am just like you i got in trouble in elementary school for flapping my hands and twirling			2
i even got in trouble for sitting in my chair strangely			2
when the @entity38 massacre occurred , my music teacher told the class to be nicer to me because , as she said , " look what can happen when kids are bullied			0
" that really upset and embarrassed me			0
the comment made me feel as though i had more potential for violence , which is clearly false			2
in high school , i decided that i wanted to make contact with other kids who had been diagnosed with autism and were cast out by their own peer groups and looking for support			2
with my friend @entity53 , we built @entity54 , a community for people who wanted to share their personal experiences with autism			1
we now have more than 70,000 registered members from around the world			0
after the shootings in @entity2 , as i often do when a major news event occurs , i immediately went to my online community to see what other people were saying			1
one member asked , " how long before the media paints the gunman as a quiet loner with @entity17 traits ? " as we now know , it did n't take too long			0
groups : autism not to blame for violence the same thing has happened before , like in the @entity77 theater shooting , when @entity78 irresponsibly speculated that the shooter , @entity80 , might have been " on the autism scale			1
" he later clarified his comments , saying he did not mean to link autism with violent behavior			0
as the @entity2 news unfolded , i noticed a huge traffic spike to our online community			1
when i checked the servers , i realized that people were finding the website by googling search terms such as " autistic killers , " " asperger 's and criminal behavior " and " aspergers shooter			0
" that gave me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach			0
i only hoped that the searches indicated that people wanted to find out the truth : that autism is not connected with violent acts			1
most people with autism who i know of are deeply sensitive and ethical ; we just have trouble reading social signals			1
research has also shown that we are less likely to engage in criminal behavior			0
if anything , those with autism are more likely to be bullied or treated with scorn because we are a little different			0
fortunately , not everyone has been listening to some of the so - called experts who are implying that autism has something to do with @entity15 's horrible act			1
a chorus of intelligent voices , including @entity0 's @entity126 and @entity127 , @entity129 reporter @entity128 , author @entity130 and @entity131 , the first openly autistic @entity133 appointee , has done well to dispel the misconceptions			0
troubling legacy of @entity136 may be backlash against kids with autism but the repetition of damaging stereotypes means more needs to be done to address the myths and stigma around autism , which puts people who are already at a high risk for bullying in even more danger			1
i was really touched when i saw the photo of @entity136 , a 6 - year - old boy with autism who died in the arms of his special - needs aide , @entity153 , in @entity2			1
in the face of such terrible tragedy , we do n't need more senseless finger - pointing at an entire community of people			1
we need more than ever to find our common humanity			0
remembering the victims the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			1

@entity164 : after @entity2 shooting , some people say autism is linked to violence
@entity171 : these speculations are needless , untrue and hurtful
he says people with autism are ethical but have trouble reading social signals
@entity171 : we do n't need more senseless finger - pointing at an entire community
