-- the makers of @entity3 pomegranate juice say that the drink improves blood flow and heart health , prevents and treats prostate cancer , and works 40 percent as well as @entity9 ( whatever that means )			2
all for about four bucks a bottle			0
those impressive claims helped the company rack up $ 91 million in sales in 2009			2
they also earned the disapproval of the @entity17 ( @entity17 )			1
last month , the agency sued @entity3 for making " false and unsubstantiated " health claims , and is asking the company to remove the claims from its ads. a 100 percent juice drink that contains antioxidants ( and no added sugar ) , @entity3 is just one of many beverages that bill themselves as promoting better health			1
@entity29 , kombucha tea , coconut water , and various brands of juice drinks made from acai , goji berry , and mangosteen have all used health claims in their marketing -- and some , like @entity3 , have been the subject of scrutiny and legal action			1
the @entity17 , along with the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) , has been cracking down on food and beverage makers for allegedly overselling the health benefits of their products			1
in 2009 alone , the @entity42 warned 17 companies that they were providing misleading nutritional information on their packaging or making overly specific health claims			1
@entity0 : 25 diet - busting foods you should never eat not all of the products were drinks , but " the beverage category stands out , " says @entity57 , director of legal affairs at the @entity59 , a consumer advocacy group based in @entity60 " at first blush it seems that beverage products are certainly a large proportion of food products that make bogus health - related claims			1
" drinks such as @entity3 have become increasingly popular with consumers in recent years , thanks in part to public health campaigns against soda that have been prompted by the obesity epidemic			1
" the trend is away from traditional soda pop [ toward ] products claiming to provide magical health benefits , " @entity57 says			2
are the health claims true ? yes and no. the federal government does n't require companies to vet health claims with the agency before plastering them on product packaging ( as long as the claims are accompanied by a disclaimer about their uncertainty )			1
but that does n't mean the claims are invented -- most are based in research			1
the research is often funded by the manufacturers , however , and industry - funded research can be prone to bias			0
a 2007 study found that research on health drinks that was funded entirely by beverage companies was between four and eight times more likely to find a favorable result than research with no industry support			2
" if a cell phone company told you they tested all the models and their model came out the best , would you believe it ? probably not , " says dr. @entity110 , @entity111 , one of the co-authors of that study and a researcher at @entity115			0
" the same is true with nutrition research , but the stakes are higher because we 're putting our bodies at risk			0
" where 's the line between research and marketing ? sounds great , hard to believe however far - fetched the claims may sound , @entity3 is standing behind them			2
( two weeks before the @entity17 publicly announced its lawsuit , @entity3 preemptively sued the @entity17 , claiming that preapproval of ads featuring health claims violates the company 's right to free speech			1
) but are shoppers really convinced that @entity3 can unclog their arteries , cure cancer , and lead to hotter sex ? there seem to be more than a few believers out there			2
" i started drinking @entity3 after reading the studies two years ago , my triglycerides were almost 1000 ! , " one of @entity3 's 12,000 fans breathlessly posted on @entity146 after the @entity17 announced its lawsuit			2
" working out everyday , drinking @entity3 , and eating healthy , they are now less than 400			0
forget what the @entity148 say ! i believe ! ! ! " ( a triglycerides level of 400 is still nearly three times higher than what 's considered normal			0
) most health beverage drinkers are n't as enthusiastic as the realtor from @entity155 who posted the above testimonial			2
@entity157 , a 22 - year - old marketing coordinator at @entity158 , in @entity159 , started to drink @entity160 as a middle schooler because it seemed like a healthy alternative to soda			0
" i figured that if they were selling something that i could get extra vitamins from , it could n't hurt to drink , " @entity157 says			0
" once i learned they were really just cleverly marketed sugar waters , i stopped			0
" @entity0 : you are what you drink but the fact is , even when people do n't buy the health claims they often still buy the beverage			1
that 's the paradox of products such as @entity3 , @entity177 says : the health claims on these products strain the imagination , yet studies have repeatedly shown that health claims sell food			1
that 's because these claims -- however improbable they may seem -- distract shoppers from the real nutritional information and hook consumers with buzzwords like " antioxidant			1
" this phenomenon is known as a " health halo , " an aura of healthfulness attached to a product based on labels like " low - fat " " all - natural " or " made with whole grains " that seduces consumers into overeating			1
according to a study by the @entity17 , this halo effect can even lead people to overlook warning statements -- about the high sodium content of a product , for example			2
" a healthy halo develops around products like these , " says @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 's senior food and nutrition editor			0
" the health - conscious consumer incorporates them into their lifestyle , thinking that they 're doing a world of good for themselves			0
" @entity0 : food label know - how : 5 mistakes even savvy shoppers make ceating a health halo the makers of @entity3 have spent $ 34 million on scientific research on @entity3 products and pomegranates			1
according to the @entity17 's complaint , the studies @entity3 has funded do not substantiate the company 's claims , and a closer look at the research seems to bear that out			1
one of the most prominent claims , that @entity3 can decrease arterial plaque by 30 percent , was taken from a single pilot study that included just 19 people and was funded by the makers of @entity3			0
another claim , that @entity3 drinkers experience a 17 percent improvement in blood flow , was taken from another pom - funded study that included just 45 people and only lasted for three months			0
" these days it 's possible for a food company to pay just about anybody to conduct a study , " says @entity57			0
@entity255 , @entity256 , a cholesterol researcher at @entity258 , in @entity259 , @entity260 , defended his studies on pomegranates -- many of them funded by @entity3 -- by noting that they were published in " very prestigious peer reviewed journals , " including the @entity266 and @entity267			0
dr. @entity268 , @entity111 , a physician at @entity269 who has also led research funded by @entity3 , directed all inquiries to a @entity3 spokesman			0
" a grocery store is a designed marketing environment to get people to buy things , " says @entity110			0
" lots of products are going to try to use health claims from research , often from their own industry , [ just ] to sell a product			1
" @entity0 : 14 health products you probably do n't need @entity286 health claims do n't mean that products like pomegranate juice should be avoided at all costs , says @entity290 , @entity212 , a spokesperson for the @entity291			1
as long as consumers limit themselves to 8 - ounce servings and products with no added sugar , juice can be an excellent source of vitamins and other nutrients , @entity290 says			0
but it 's " not going to solve any of your health issues , " she adds			0
the bottom line is that consumers should n't believe everything they read on labels			1
" if they focus on consuming an overall well - balanced diet , they might not need to focus so much on finding a product that makes false promises , " @entity290 says			0

consumers should n't believe everything they read on labels
the @entity17 and @entity42 have been cracking down on unsubstantiated health claims
though many health claims strain imagination , they still sell food and beverages
these claims distract shoppers from the real nutritional information
