the flames , which authorities said were caused by lightning , have destroyed more than 100 structures and left one person dead			2
" there 's a number of people like myself , ( for whom ) packing up and leaving when you have livestock and animals just is n't as easy as if you have just a house , " @entity1 said			2

" @entity1 said the officers told him if he crossed the line , his wife and children would " just have to figure their own way out			0
