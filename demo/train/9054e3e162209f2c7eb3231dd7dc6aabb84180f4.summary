@entity0 -- the screech of clear , heavy - duty duct tape scratches on the ear even before the mass of mainland @entity7 visitors comes into view			1
this is the daily soundtrack from thousands of people packing up brown cardboard boxes outside @entity13 train station , the last rail stop in @entity0 before mainland @entity7			1
every day these mainlanders make a @entity0 entrance , picking up goods on behalf of @entity7 - based agents			1
every evening , they make an exodus back across the border , taking with them sundry items that include @entity0 - made baby formula and @entity25 diapers to beauty masks and bottled @entity28 frappucinos			1
some call these people " grey traders			2
" others call them " mainland mules			2
" local residents call them a nuisance			1
@entity36 , chairman of @entity0 's @entity37 for the past five years , says the daily horde makes his constituents angry			1
" they 're mad because these visitors make a big mess			2
they throw their used lunchboxes everywhere			0
they even injure people when they bump into them with their trolleys , " he says			0
so says it has as much to do with trust as it does with tariffs over the past few years			0
food scandals in mainland @entity7 , including the 2008 tainted baby formula scare in which more than 53,000 infants were reported ill , have pushed many consumers to buy products made elsewhere			1
@entity0 goods are considered to adhere to stricter quality guidelines			1
many products in @entity0 have also become cheaper than the same ones found in mainland @entity7			1
since 2005 , @entity7 's currency , the yuan , has strengthened 25 % against the @entity71 dollar , to which the @entity70 is pegged			1
and if goods are ferried over in a piecemeal fashion by mainland day traders -- box - by - box versus traditional cargo containers -- importers can avoid commercial tariffs that average 50 %			1
taxes on electronic goods can reach as high as 70 % , adds so			2
that kind of savings keeps the cross-border grey trade very much alive			0
" these mainland @entity7 visitors buy anything and everything -- as long as it 's not ' made in @entity7 , ' " says so			1
about a 20 - minute walk from the train station , at a non-descript but well - known warehouse for this industry , hundreds of mainlanders swarm the building as they pick up their goods bound for @entity7			1
sweaty workers wheel out pallets of boxes that advertise instant noodles and diapers made in @entity99			0
@entity101 traders -- men , women , young and old -- then put them on small handcarts and walk to the train station			0
while no one would give their full name , one worker revealed he earns hk $ 100 , or about u.s. $ 12 , per round trip			0
he admitted it is not much money but it is enough to take care of his family			0
his wife , a @entity0 citizen , just gave birth to their first baby			1
one lady who only identified herself by her surname of @entity119 said that they all face pressure at customs as well			0
" if our goods get turned away at the mainland border , we just have to dump them			1
so there 's risk in this business , " she says			0
there is also risk -- and reward -- for regular border area businesses			2
pharmacies , convenience stores and jewelry shops have welcomed the rise in demand			2
shop worker salaries have doubled in the past two years to cater to the surge of shoppers			0
but rents for retail space have tripled in the past three years and inflation is a chronic concern , according to various neighborhood shop owners			0
aside from the economic woes , residents cite other issues that include hygiene , environmental and crowd complaints			2
in recognition of rising @entity157 animosity from @entity0 , @entity154 shelved a controversial plan earlier this month that would have opened the door to millions more mainland visitors to the city			1
four million people from @entity163 alone - right across the border - would have been eligible under the proposed program			2
many @entity0 citizens are upfront with their emotions about their mainland cousins			1
annoyed , " said local resident @entity170			0
" ( there are ) too many people around us disturbing our country			0
most of them are being bad - mannered			0
" @entity36 , the district chairman , is more nuanced			0
@entity0 is an " open " city that does welcome conventional tourists who stay at hotels , eat at restaurants and visit the city 's theme parks like @entity182 , he says			2
but he also holds a caveat for non-conventional tourists -- those grey traders who hold multi-entry visa holders that crisscross the border each day			2
" we need to weigh the pros and cons. to us in this district , the cons outweigh the pros			0
we do n't have room for more people			0
" still , he may be talking against a tide that can not be turned			0
in 2011 , @entity0 , a city of 7 million people , saw 28 million mainland visitors -- two thirds of the city 's total visitors , according to the @entity202			1
that is expected to grow even more , further reinforcing the reality that @entity0 's economy is wedded more to mainland @entity7 as the years pass for this former @entity207 colony			1
@entity208 contributed to this report .			0

every day thousands of mainland @entity7 go to @entity0 to buy goods
they 're paid by agents to meet demand for @entity216 , cheaper products
residents near the border complain that they 're a nuisance
