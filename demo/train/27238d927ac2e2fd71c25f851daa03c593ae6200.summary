-- friday morning , many @entity1 lined up outside their local convenience stores , hoping to pick the lucky numbers that would win the record - setting $ 640 million jackpot offered by @entity5			1
the curious thing about this fervor is not that the odds of winning are 1 in 176 million , but rather that in effect , @entity1 are anxiously lining up to pay a tax , even if it is wrapped in attractive clothing			1
while no government actually labels its lottery a tax , the games properly fit the definition of one			2
after lottery winnings are paid out and administrative costs have been covered , the leftover money is transferred into state coffers to pay for state programs			2
state governments have developed a strong reliance on these lottery " profits " over the years			0
in 2010 , states collected an average of $ 58 per capita in implicit tax revenue from their lottery programs			1
@entity33 , which had the heaviest reliance on lottery revenue , collected a stunning $ 370 per capita			2
this increasing reliance on lotteries to fund state governments is troubling , as these taxes disproportionately fall on low - income individuals			0
a slew of studies in the past two decades has found that low - income people spend a greater portion of their income on lottery tickets than do high - income individuals , meaning lotteries are a regressive way to collect tax revenue			1
many have argued that while lotteries are indeed taxes , they are not so bad , because people pay them voluntarily			1
but people only buy government lottery tickets voluntarily because private lotteries are not allowed to operate			1
state lotteries only pay out an average of 60 % of their gross revenues , a payout vastly inferior to those of slot machines and table games , which offer payouts in many cases above 90 %			2
people only buy state - run lottery tickets because tickets with better odds are choked out of the market			0
so while the purchase of the ticket itself is voluntary , the portion of that ticket sale that goes to state revenues is not , much in the same way that a sales tax paid on a book is not voluntarily paid			0
the curious relationship between state - run lotteries and taxes does not end there though			0
even when someone wins the lottery , the winnings are subject to special withholding taxes at the state and federal levels			0
if someone wins the $ 640 million jackpot , they would be immediately subject to a 25 % federal withholding and state withholding rates as high as 12 %			1
their total income tax burden on the winnings might be more depending on how they invest that income and what credits and deductions they take next april			0
