-- @entity1 is best known for two things : being funny and being crass			1
" if you 're the president you only have two jobs : peace and money , " @entity1 said			1
" this is what people come to see			2
i 'm just doing my show , " the comedian said with a laugh			1
he 's also known for his political commentary , but there 's one person he 's having a lot of trouble making fun of -- president - elect @entity19			1
this is apparent in his new dvd " @entity22 , " which combines three shows from his international tour : @entity25 ; @entity26 , @entity27 ; and @entity28 , @entity29			1
" it was a tour nobody wanted to do ... because the general perception is that comedy does n't translate , " @entity1 said			1
but thanks to the @entity35 , the world is a lot smaller than it was even 10 years ago			2
and people are digging the same jokes , he said , including ones about @entity41 and @entity42			1
as the dvd readies for release on january 20 , @entity0 talked with @entity1 about his lack of @entity19 jokes , @entity46 and why racism will never die			1
the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity0 : i watched the special last night , and i noticed that you did a lot of jokes about @entity41 -- his age , his war hero story -- but not so many about @entity19			1
is it harder to make fun of @entity19 ? @entity1 : he 's just one of those guys , you know , like @entity62			1
there 's no @entity62 jokes			1
there 's no @entity67 jokes			1
you know , what are you going to say ? " ooh , you used to have sex with @entity72			2
now you have sex with @entity74			2
you 're such a loser			2
" what do you say ? " ooh , your movies are big			2
you make $ 20 million			1
" there 's nothing to say about @entity67			1
@entity0 : why is @entity19 like that ? rock : it 's like " ooh , you 're young and virile and you 've got a beautiful wife and kids			1
you 're the first @entity86 - @entity85 president			1
" you know , what do you say ? @entity0 : as time goes on do you think it will get easier ? rock : of course , as time goes on			1
at some point he 's going to -- there 's always slip - ups			1
no one can survive that level of scrutiny without occasionally making it easy for a comedian			2
@entity0 : let 's talk about the inauguration			0
are you going ? rock : no , i have to go to @entity104 [ @entity105 ]			2
i 've got a movie premiering at @entity104			0
so i have to go to the whitest place in @entity85 -- @entity108			1
@entity0 : what 's it going to be like for you on @entity46 ? rock : it 'll be a cool day			2
i 've never watched an inauguration			0
i 've never watched anyone get sworn in			0
you know , it 's like @entity118 and then you look up and somebody else is the president two months later			0
it was never like , " i ca n't wait till tomorrow			0
oh my god ! they 're going to swear in @entity124 ! " @entity0 : are you going to watch this one , though ? rock : i 'll put it this way -- like any business is going to be getting done while this guy is getting sworn in			2
like i 'm going to be in a meeting			0
everything is going to stop for however long it takes			0
hope they get to it -- hope it 's not like i got ta listen to three different versions of " @entity139 " or something			0
i hope it 's not like @entity143 ' funeral , where everybody f * * * ing speaks			0
@entity0 : what are you hoping @entity19 does for this country ? what do you think is his most important task ? rock : you know , if you 're the president you only have two jobs : peace and money			1
i mean , it 's like , what did @entity158 do ? we were at peace and we had a budget surplus			0
the closer you get us to those two goals , you know , that 's pretty much the gig			0
is that too much to ask for ? @entity0 : at one point in your act , you said , " @entity175 will never die			0
" why do you believe that ? rock : well , it 's never going to die			2
maybe it wo n't multiply			0
is racism going to end ? no. it 's not even race			0
people are always going to , you know , find something wrong with people who are not the exact same as them			0
that 's just what it is			0
@entity190 , white , short , tall , religions , whatever			0
people are bad , man			0
@entity0 : how was it different playing for an audience in @entity29 ? rock : you know it 's weird -- it really was n't that different			1
i mean , that 's why i love this special			0
people are the same wherever you go			0
and if they were n't , they would n't laugh at the same s * * t. if they were so different they would n't know what i was talking about			0
@entity0 : stand - up comics i 've talked to in the past say they like their shows to appear spontaneous			1
but your new dvd stitches together three shows , illustrating to the audience how scripted comedy can be			1
why did you decide on that format ? rock : you know , i do n't believe in that " come up with stuff on the spot			2
" i mean , honestly , that 's why i think comedy , stand - up comedy , always plays such a back seat to music			1
like , would you go see a singer if you thought he just came up with the songs ? they would n't give out @entity228 for songs that they just came up with			0
you 're going to go see someone at @entity232 or @entity233 , i think you 'd like to know that they have an act before you spend $ 75			0
so yeah , when you say " came up with it right there , " that 's really cute when you paid $ 8 to get in and two - drink minimum			2
when the ticket 's $ 75 , that 's a whole other mindset .			0
