-- anything creative begins with a question			2
the problem is that questions take us into uncertainty , which is a very dangerous place to be			1
if there were a predator next to you and your brain was n't absolutely sure what to do , then it 'd probably be too late			0
the need to translate ambiguous sensory information into meaningful behavior has been the fundamental drive of brain evolution , without which survival in a complex world would not have been possible			1
and yet a deep irony is that the best questions -- i.e. , the ones that challenge our deepest sense of what is true -- create the most uncertainty			2
so how is it possible to be creative ? fortunately nature gave us a solution , which in the context of human culture we call science			1
not science reduced to the methods section of a paper , but science as a " way of being , " where not only is uncertainty celebrated , but so too are possibility , diversity and openness			1
in other words ... play			0
watch @entity47 's @entity46 armed with this idea that science is play ( and thus experiments are games ) i asked whether we could not simply teach children about science , but actually enable them to become the scientist and in this way offer children an essential tool for contending with the uncertainty that is inherent to life			1
the answer to this question was the @entity63			0
through the course of several " workshops " spread over three months , @entity66 and i went on a journey with 25 children aged 8 to 10 years old			0
the journey was broken down into several distinct stages , but what happened within each stage was an emergent consequence of the interactions with and between the children			0
the first step was " wonder , " since without it there 's no motivation to ask a question			0
the second was to ask " why ? " the third " what if ? " and the fourth -- " @entity84 ? " in other words , the focus was not on coming up with answers to questions set by a teacher ( in which the answers are already known ) , but on asking questions -- novel questions -- that were of interest to the children			0
in this instance , those questions came in the context of bumblebee visual behavior			1
the children came up with the idea of seeing if bumblebees could learn to recognize different spatial configurations of color , which is important for bees in deciding which flowers to go to for foraging and was a relatively unknown area of science			1
@entity46 : @entity110 's advice to young scientists it should be noted that we did not receive funding for this project largely because it was thought that children " ... could not do it , " and because the funders required the process to be fully prescribed , which is like asking an artist to describe what the painting is going to look like before he / she paints it , or to describe the results of an experiment before even the question itself has been devised			2
not only did the children devise meaningful questions , but also crafted games ( i.e. experiments ) to address them			1
they made the subsequent observations and working together created a " story " about the process and their observations			0
it was the latter that was submitted for publication			0
@entity46 : yep , i built a nuclear fusion reactor naturally , while the editors of nearly every biologically - based science journal -- including the most prestigious journals -- were interested in the story and process , none were willing to review the manuscript because it was n't written in the typical style of a science paper			1
this , however , creates a problem			0
if one has observations that are both novel and relevant obtained from a robust scientific method , are the findings made less important by mode of communication ? ( the paper was eventually published by the journal @entity159 ; read it here			1
) the @entity63 demonstrates that by participating in real science , we can all become observers of the intimately private process by which our brains make sense of the world			1
by becoming actively involved in the process of making sense , the children not only became the scientist -- and thus learned about science from within -- but the process fostered in each child a sense of choice , creativity and compassion			0
@entity46 : award - winning teenage science in action these latter motivations are , i 'd suggest , the true reasons for changing the way science is currently taught in our schools -- to " @entity195 : " to become actively aware of how our environment , perception and imagination shape who we are as an individual and as a society			0
this arguably unique human capacity is the principal act of consciousness that has the power to transform our view of the world and of ourselves , since it creates the opportunity to find and create new relationships that will shape future behavior			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

@entity208 : uncertainty is dangerous in a predatory world , but essential for *innovation*
he says science gives *people* the means to be creative in devising theories , experiments
@entity208 *recruited* **students** to take part in a science project about the visual behavior of bumblebees
**students** crafted experiments and wrote their findings in a paper that was published
