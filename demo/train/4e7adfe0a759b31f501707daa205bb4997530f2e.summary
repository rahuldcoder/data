a teacher at a catholic school in @entity2 is suing the diocese where she worked after being fired because the in vitro fertilization treatments she received were considered against church teachings			1
@entity6 , a former @entity7 teacher at @entity8 in @entity9 , filed a federal lawsuit against the school and the diocese of @entity13			1
she says in the suit filed friday that she was discriminated against in 2011 after the school 's pastor found out that she had begun treatments with a fertility doctor , according to the complaint			1
@entity6 says the school 's priest called her a " grave , immoral sinner " and told her she should have kept mum about her fertility treatments because some things are " better left between the individual and @entity27 , " the complaint said			1
" i did n't think i was doing anything wrong , " @entity6 told @entity29 on thursday			2
" i had never had any complaints about me as a teacher			0
" the diocese responded , saying it " views the core issue raised in this lawsuit as a challenge to the diocese 's right , as a religious employer , to make religious based decisions consistent with its religious standards on an impartial basis			1
" in its statement , diocese officials said that " the church promotes treatment of infertility through means that respect the right to life , the unity of marriage , and procreation brought about as the fruit of the conjugal act			0
there are other infertility treatments , such as in vitro fertilization , which are not morally licit according to @entity62 teaching			1
" the statement adds that teachers working in the diocese are required to " have a knowledge and respect for the catholic faith , and abide by the tenets of the @entity70			2
" @entity6 said she underwent her first in vitro fertilization treatment in march 2010 , and immediately told her supervisor , the school 's principal			1
" the first time she was made aware that my husband and i had to go through fertility treatments , she said , ' you are in my prayers , ' " @entity6 said			1
" to me , that was support			0
" it was after she requested time off for her second treatment more than a year later that the school 's pastor , @entity85			0
@entity87 , requested to meet with @entity6 , according to the complaint			2
during the meeting , @entity6 says @entity87 told her that it would have been better if she had n't said anything about the treatments because they could cause a scandal			2
eleven days later , @entity6 said , she was notified that her contract at the school would not be renewed because of " improprieties related to church teachings or law			2
" observers say @entity6 's case bears some of the hallmarks of the case of @entity104 , a former teacher who was fired from a religious school in @entity106 after taking a medical leave of absence in 2004			1
at issue was whether the @entity110 applies to hiring and firing decisions involving " ministerial employees , " such as teachers who teach secular subjects			0
the @entity116 @entity115 decided that @entity104 -- who taught secular subjects along with a religion class -- was considered a " minister " and could in fact be fired based on church doctrine			0
" the interest of society in the enforcement of employment discrimination statutes is undoubtedly important , " chief justice @entity122 said at the time			0
" but so too is the interest of religious groups in choosing who will preach their beliefs , teach their faith and carry out their mission			0
" @entity6 and her lawyer , @entity134 , say that since @entity6 taught only @entity7 , she should be exempt from the so - called ministerial exception			0
@entity6 noted that after being hired at @entity8 in 2003 , she never taught religion and never held an official title within the @entity70			0
but some legal observers say that because @entity6 worked at a catholic school , her decision to undergo fertility treatments could be construed as a clash with the school 's broader mission			1
" the doctrine exists in order to protect the religious institution 's right to protect their message , " said @entity145 , a law professor at the @entity146			0
but @entity152 , senior litigation counsel at @entity153 , disagreed , saying that deeming an @entity7 teacher " a minister " in a religious school constitutes " exhibit a of what goes wrong if the exception becomes too broad			2
" " if a teacher of purely secular subjects is considered a minister , then the implication of that is that everyone who works for a catholic school would be considered a minister , " he said			1
" it becomes an open license to discriminate			0
