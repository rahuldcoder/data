cute and adorable or simply odd ? the first of @entity3 's long range @entity1 jets completed its maiden flight to @entity5 last week , drawing a litter of curious @entity8 enthusiasts			1
whatever your taste -- and judging by the comments below on this updated story , @entity8 is more than quite palatable -- the flight marks something of a big step in brand extension for @entity19 's famed cat			0
@entity1 and her mates are hugely popular the world over , nowhere more so than in @entity22 where @entity23 airline @entity3 flies five @entity8 - themed planes in a tie - up with @entity19			1
this adds to @entity8 being on everything from restaurants to toasters ( where @entity8 's face is burned into your bread ) to beer pong tables			0
sticking her on a metal tube and taking her to the @entity36 and back is a braver move -- thrice - weekly flights from @entity39 to @entity5 began september 20			1
@entity40 is unlikely to be spared with a @entity40 schedule also reportedly on the cards			0
each current @entity1 plane has a theme and for the @entity39 - @entity5 flight , the new design features 19 @entity19 characters , including @entity48 ( @entity1 's bff ) , @entity51 ' @entity50 and @entity52 as well as rival character @entity53 , the trouble - making bunny			1
that kind of explains the plane 's theme of " @entity60 hand - in - hand			1
" according to a company statement , the new design tries to convey the message of " embracing the world and overcoming various cultural barriers			0
" the @entity1 planes flying to @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 from @entity23 are @entity71 but for its states - side adventure the feline cat is aboard a new @entity75 aircraft , the world 's largest twin - engined plane			1
@entity1 restaurant is terribly cute and its food just terrible like the @entity81 , the @entity80 is drenched inside and out with @entity8 and co. what do you think ? cute or sickening ? let us know in the comments below in an earlier version of this story , we took a look at the interior of the @entity81			1
which give an indication of what will reside inside the @entity75			0
more than 100 inflight items bear the @entity1 motif , including headrest covers , tissues , utensils , snacks and soap dispensers			1
and when you 're not blowing your nose on @entity1 or tearing her in two to get at some peanuts , flight attendants wearing @entity1 aprons will sell you limited edition duty - free goods branded with the cutesy animal			2
passengers ' immersion into the world of @entity8 begins before they get on the plane			0

the @entity66 cartoon company @entity19 launched @entity1 , depicted as a white female cat with a red bow in its hair , in 1974			2
three and a half decades later , she was earning worldwide revenue of $ 5 billion a year			0
@entity19 and @entity3 collaborated on their first generation of @entity8 - themed aircraft in 2005			2
with their latest flights , they are providing @entity8 with a new aviation market to conquer			0
at last : @entity132 's first @entity131			0
