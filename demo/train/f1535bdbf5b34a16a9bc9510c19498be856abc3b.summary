@entity2 , @entity1 political attacks have really gone to the dogs			2
they used to have more style and substance			2
it was considered bad form to just weave an attack out of whole cloth , counting on the fact that the mark was so despised by a segment of society that people would be anxious to believe the worst			2
it used to be that when you wanted to sling mud at someone whose politics you did n't agree with -- chiefly as a way of making them look bad and yourself look good by comparison -- you 'd try to dig up dirt , find a skeleton in a closet or challenge the person 's integrity			1
these days , you do n't have to work that hard			2
the whole process is do - it - yourself			2
you just go to @entity33 and see what embarrassing family photos can be linked to the person you intend to slime			2
the target does n't even have to be in the photo			1
just the fact that they posted it , or thought it was humorous , or in any way condoned the act is good enough			0
in our narcissistic look - at - me - and - mine culture , social media networks are veritable treasure chests of blunders , blushes and blemishes			0
even with our best efforts to use these sites to showcase our best features , there is plenty of embarrassment to go around			0
once you find the photos , you do a little cut and paste			0
then you can scribble a few sentences about how shocked -- shocked ! -- you are that people could behave in such a manner			0
be sure to include a line from the head of some nonprofit that raises funds by advancing the idea that , without a group like theirs , our entire society would be in dire straits			0
if you 're attacking someone on the left , you might hunt around on social media for a photo where they 're not wearing a flag pin and accuse them of being unpatriotic			1
if you 're trying to smear someone on the right , you can fall back on the old standby and accuse them of being uncaring			0
how uncaring ? enough to use a dog as a food stool			1
the offender in question is 6 - year - old @entity86 , who became an instant target of supposedly tolerant liberals when he wound up being born to mother @entity89 , one of the most popular political figures for conservatives and a constant thorn in the side of liberals			1
this time , what put @entity86 in the liberal 's version of " timeout " is a photo on his mom 's @entity33 page of him standing barefoot on his new pet dog -- a black labrador oddly named @entity106 -- so he could reach the kitchen sink and wash his dish			1
the liberal organization , @entity109 , was not amused			1
@entity109 blasted @entity86 in a statement , calling her " hard - hearted " and " bizarrely callous			1
" the statement read , " it 's odd that anyone -- let alone a mother -- would find it appropriate to post such a thing , with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo			1
" you know who deserves sympathy ? the journalists who got that statement and had to whip up a story based on faux outrage			0
@entity86 struck back by zeroing in with the real reason that groups like @entity109 have lost influence and credibility : the double standard they employ , denouncing certain behavior by the people they oppose while excusing the same behavior by people they support			1
where was the organization last year , she asked , when the liberal talk show hosted by @entity142 , posted a similar photo of a girl standing on a dog ? back then , @entity109 was awol			1
she is right about the double standard			0
and i admire her spunk			0
in a world of politicians and even former politicians who are so careful about what they say and do that they do n't say or do anything , @entity86 unplugged is a refreshing exception			1
there is more to the story			0
according to media reports , the canine is a service dog that was trained to care for @entity86 , who has down syndrome			1
the little guy does n't just need special care			0
it seems that he also needs constant protection -- from liberals who hate his mommy			0
@entity86 was first targeted by the left in february 2010 , when he was just shy of 2 years old			1
that 's when @entity169 , creator of the @entity171 animated comedy , " @entity172 , " thought it would be a hoot to air an episode that demolished all the preaching that liberals have done over the years about tolerance and the importance of defending those with special needs			2
in the episode , the character @entity180 is dating a teenage girl with @entity183 , and when he asks her what her parents do , she says , " my dad 's an accountant , and my mom is the former governor of @entity186			2
" @entity189 , head of the @entity191 - based @entity190 , called the gag " hurtful and stereotypical			0
" and @entity86 's daughter @entity193 wrote on her mom 's facebook page that the joke was especially cruel given that her brother already faces a life filled with intolerance and prejudice			1
on the defensive , @entity201 claimed at the time that he was " an equal opportunity offender			0
in 2008 , the comedian had spoken at an @entity207 - @entity206 rally at a university in @entity209 , where he took potshots at @entity211 and touted the @entity213 ticket			0
as all this unfolded , we learned -- thanks to @entity86 -- a valuable lesson about how the tolerant left has a much stronger stomach for intolerance if its aimed at one of its enemies			1
now the little guy is at it again , teaching us that liberals are creative enough to make smears out of thin air			0
in a perfect world , i 'd prefer that children not mistake their household pets for a step ladder			0
but whatever else can be said about the world that @entity86 is likely to face in the years to come , this much we know : it wo n't be perfect .			1
