-- when @entity2 asked @entity3 and @entity4 about comedians ' handling of @entity7 , the @entity0 host noted that there have been quite a few " fantastically funny " moments in the @entity11 race in particular			1
" do you thank @entity13 every day that these things happen ? " asked @entity2			0
" yes , " answered @entity4 , " this is a gift from @entity13 to comedians the likes of which we have never seen			1
" " it 's a ship of fools that is -- it 's just unbelievable , " said @entity4			1
" i used to have a theory that i took almost through all the presidencies			0
and it was that you 're either -- it 's like the @entity28			2
you 're either a @entity30 , who 's in charge , or a @entity32 , who wants to be a @entity30 , or you 're @entity33 , who is nuts and totally just off the page			2
" @entity4 and @entity3 are guests on thursday 's " @entity36			1
" the @entity37 recently hailed @entity4 , a tv director , as " a comic institution			2
" among his credits are " friends , " " @entity41 , " " @entity42 , " " @entity43 , " " weeds " and " @entity45			0
" @entity4 's latest project , " @entity47 , " is a joint venture with @entity3			1
the documentary - style series about comedians airs thursday nights on @entity53			1
@entity4 called the new series " unique in the way in which the comedians talk about what they do			1
... there is no audience			0
they 're not on , but they 're funny			1
" on " @entity47 , " the featured comedians talk about their childhood comedy heroes , among other things			1
@entity3 , who called the entertainers ' comedic influences " a matter of personal taste , " counted @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 among his influences growing up			2
each episode of " @entity47 " is a standalone documentary			1
episode four , in which @entity77 will be interviewed , airs monday night			0
it also features @entity80 and @entity81			0
@entity4 conducts the interviews in the half - hour series			1
" i think @entity4 is the best interviewer because he puts people at ease , " said @entity3			1
" only because , you know , you have all of these people who do tend to be on a lot			0
but he puts them in a comfort zone and allows them to not only be funny , but to be themselves			0
so you find out a little bit more about them in a personal way , which i think is great			0
" @entity4 also noted that " @entity47 " sets out to debunk certain myths about stand - up comics			1
one such myth : comedians have to be so - called wounded souls to achieve success			2
@entity4 and @entity3 pointed out that " seinfeld " helped break that barrier and also made it socially acceptable to be a comedian			1
" when i started out , " @entity4 said , " being a comedian was not a great thing			2
if your girlfriend brought you home to your mother and said he 's a comedian , they would n't be happy about it			0
but now , it 's become corporate with ' @entity41			0
' " @entity4 further noted the show fueled the incorrect assumption that comedy meant big bucks			2
" a lot of young people make the mistake of going into comedy just because it 's a lucrative business , as opposed to earlier , even @entity124 and i , we were in ' @entity126 , ' we never ... thought of going beyond ' @entity126 ' in @entity128			0
" " if i could trap you both on a desert island separately , " asked @entity2 , " and you could have one comedian with you to make you laugh for the rest of your days , who would you take ? " @entity3 said he would take @entity134 " because he makes , one - to - one , he makes me laugh more than anyone i 've ever met ... he 's so dry and so acerbic			1
i love being around the man			0
" @entity4 said he would take either @entity137 , whom he referred to as " acerbic " and " fun , " or @entity81 , who he called " nonstop funny all the time			1
" @entity2 pointed out that when " the 40 - year - old virgin " was released , @entity3 was catapulted into an " international comedic superstar " although he did have a successful career in comedy beforehand			1
@entity3 , who has two young children , said that his life did n't change all that much and that he still goes to the movies and the mall like anyone else			2
" i certainly have more money than i did , " @entity3 said , " but my home life , my family life , all of that really has stayed essentially the same			0
" @entity3 said success coming relatively late in life for him was a good thing because " i sort of had my ducks in a row at that point			0
i had figured things out , for the most part , in terms of my goals and my wants and dreams and what was giving me happiness , ultimately			0
so i think if it had happened early in life , i do n't know if it would have been the same story			0
" when @entity2 asked @entity3 about " @entity170 , " he referred to @entity171 as " the monster that spawned all this , " and noted that @entity3 's version of the role was " more empathetic			1
" for his version of " @entity170 , " @entity3 felt that the cliche about television audiences inviting tv characters into their homes every week rang true in this case			2
@entity3 , who starred in the @entity183 version of " @entity170 " on @entity184 for seven seasons , called @entity171 ' version " excellent , " noting that @entity171 knew going into it that the @entity189 version of the office would only last for 13 episodes , as is common with @entity193 television series			2
" he knew that the run would be limited , " said @entity3 , " and he could play this guy that was just insufferable and a truly terrible person			0
