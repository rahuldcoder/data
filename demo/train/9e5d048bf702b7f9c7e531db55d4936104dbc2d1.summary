@entity0 -- twenty - three days since they last met face - to - face and 23 days before the fiscal cliff becomes a harsh reality , the two men most pivotal to the contentious budget talks sat down sunday			1
there was no evidence of a breakthrough , though president @entity9 and @entity11 speaker @entity10 at least did agree on something : what , and what not , to say			1
sunday 's @entity11 meeting caught some by surprise , considering it had not been on the president 's official schedule and the two sides have been sparring publicly , accusing each other of failing to work sincerely toward a compromise			1
after the talks ended , @entity11 spokesman @entity23 and @entity10 spokesman @entity24 issued identical statements			1
" this afternoon , the president and speaker @entity10 met at the @entity11 to discuss efforts to resolve the fiscal cliff			1
we 're not reading out details of the conversation , but the lines of communication remain open			0
" the statements did n't give much insight into developments on the effort to prevent the @entity41 government from going over the fiscal cliff , the term referring to the widespread automatic tax hikes and spending cuts that will take effect in january without a deal			1
on sunday , @entity49 chief @entity48 echoed numerous economic experts in predicting a sharp drop in confidence and " zero " @entity41 economic growth if there 's no agreement			0
but the two political camps ' matching words were remarkable , given what they have been saying about each for weeks			0
last friday , for instance , @entity10 reported " no progress " and accused the @entity11 of having " wasted another week			2
" " there are a lot of things that are possible to put the revenue that the president seeks on the table , but none of it 's going to be possible if the president insists on his position , insists on ' my way or the highway , ' " the @entity63 @entity62 told reporters			2
@entity9 has held his ground , especially on his insistence that tax rates return to 1990s ' levels for families with incomes higher than $ 250,000 , while they 'd remain the same for those making less than that			1
after campaigning against any tax increases , many top @entity62 have expressed willingness since the election to raise revenue by adjusting deductions and loopholes			2
but @entity10 and others have said any revenue hikes must be packaged with major spending cuts , including reforms to entitlement programs such as @entity98 and @entity99			0
and they 've resisted any tax rate hikes -- including for the wealthiest @entity41 -- as part of any deal			0
there have been some public departures from that thinking however			0
on sunday , sen. @entity106 of @entity107 said he 'd support raising taxes on the top 2 % of households , arguing it will better position @entity62 to negotiate for larger spending cuts to @entity113 and @entity98 despite opposition from many @entity115			1
" a lot of people are putting forth a theory , and i actually think it has merit , where you go ahead and give the president ... the rate increase on the top 2 % , and all of a sudden the shift goes back to entitlements , " @entity106 said on " @entity116			2
" @entity106 is not entirely alone , as fellow @entity62 sens. @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 have said they could vote for such a limited tax hike			1
there have been fewer higher - profile voices express that opinion in the @entity11 , though			2
one of them , rep. @entity136 of @entity137 , reiterated sunday that he could go along with this scenario			0
" you have to do something , and doing something requires the cooperation of the @entity144 , which the @entity115 run , and the signature of the president , " @entity136 said on @entity1 's " @entity139			0
" but one of his colleagues , rep. @entity149 , said the @entity62 should n't budge			0
despite the loss of @entity62 seats in the @entity11 and @entity144 , @entity150 argued voters affirmed support for the @entity62 on @entity155 and " clearly said we do n't want our taxes to go up			1
" " the president thinks he has momentum , i think he is running on adrenaline from the campaign , " the @entity107 lawmaker told @entity1			0
