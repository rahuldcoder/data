-- the man who held at least three hostages in a nearly four - hour standoff wednesday at the @entity6 headquarters in @entity7 , @entity8 , had a history of protesting the network 's programming , authorities said			1
the man was identified by law enforcement sources as 43 - year - old @entity13 , who was shot and killed by police after officers observed him withdrawing a handgun and pointing it at one of the hostages			1
all three hostages -- identified by a @entity13 executive as two employees and a security officer -- were uninjured			1
@entity13 was described by authorities as an environmental protester who had posted online rants against @entity13 in the past			1
an angry manifesto posted by @entity13 on a website called @entity29 repeatedly refers to humans as " filth " and demands that the @entity6 " stop encouraging the birth of any more parasitic human infants			1
" " civilization must be exposed for the filth it is , " the 1,149 - word statement says			0
" humans are the most destructive , filthy , pollutive creatures around and are wrecking what 's left of the planet with their false morals and breeding culture , " it continues			1
the statement also blasts immigration , farming , weapons of mass destruction , automotive pollution , " and the whole blasted human economy			0
" it demands that the @entity6 broadcast daily prime - time shows devoted to " solutions to save the planet , " perhaps in a game - show format , insisting " make it interesting so people watch and apply solutions ! ! ! ! " many of @entity13 's comments are directed at " the media , " saying " you can reach enough people			1
it 's your responsibility because you reach so many minds ! ! ! " " the world needs tv shows that @entity68 solutions to the problems that humans are causing , not stupify the people into destroying the world			2
not encouraging them to breed more environmentally harmful humans , " the manifesto says			0
" these are the demands and sayings of @entity13 , " the manifesto concludes			2
the website also refers to a week - long protest outside the @entity13 headquarters in february 2008			1
" i will be demonstrating ideas on how to save the planet in front of the @entity85 each day until they give in , " he wrote			0
@entity89 , @entity8 , @entity88 records show a man by the same name and age was arrested that month for disorderly conduct and littering			0
according to a report by @entity8 's @entity97 newspaper published at the time , a protester identified as @entity13 was arrested outside the @entity13 building after several hours of throwing money into the air to gather a crowd			1
@entity89 police chief j. @entity103 confirmed that the suspect in the hostage situation was the same protester			2
@entity13 , who represented himself in court , said he did it to show that " money means nothing			2
money is trash , " the @entity97 quoted him as saying			0
amateur video apparently showing part of the protest shows a chaotic scene of people diving for the bills			0
the protest was cut short after concerns by county police and @entity13 security officers that the growing crowd was becoming unruly , according to testimony from sgt. @entity123 of the @entity124			2
@entity13 was found guilty of disorderly conduct in the case and sentenced to supervised probation			2
his probation ended august 18 , court records show			0
at the time of his conviction , the judge warned @entity13 not to come within 500 feet of @entity13 , according to the @entity97			2
the judge told @entity13 he could get 60 days in jail if he disobeyed the order			2
on his protest site , @entity13 refers to the arrest , writing , " yeah , i guess the world did not get saved last week as i had hoped , " and indicates he was held in police custody for two weeks			1
@entity13 told the court that part of his time in custody included a psychiatric evaluation , according to the @entity97			2
" i told them my idea of saving the planet , " the @entity97 quoted him as saying			0
" they could n't find anything wrong with me			0
" @entity13 spokesman @entity151 said wednesday that the network was aware of @entity13 and his writings			1
" i do n't want to characterize the motivations of the perpetrator , " he said			0
" if you follow what he said publicly online , i do n't think it 's rational			0
we certainly were cognizant and aware of him , but certainly did not take his threats or demands seriously			0
" @entity13 appeared to be inspired by the writings of environmentalist author @entity166 , according to statements made in the manifesto and on @entity13 's @entity170 page			1
@entity166 is best known for the novel , " @entity173 , " for which he won the 1991 @entity172			1
the fellowship was established to encourage authors to seek " creative and positive solutions to global problems , " according to @entity166 's website			1
in a 2006 @entity170 posting , @entity13 wrote : " i finished reading the @entity166 books last month			1
it started off just as a recommendation from a girl who worked at a coffeehouse			0
" after being blown away from his writings , i looked up and saw ... nothing			0
no revolution , no people demanding change , no talk , no news , nothing			0
there should have been something , right ? " @entity13 's self - proclaimed goal to save the planet appears to have begun shortly after the posting			1
however , much of his online activity appears to have ended in 2008 .			0
