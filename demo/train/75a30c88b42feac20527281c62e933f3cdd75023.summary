-- the campaign to become president of the @entity3 is drawn - out and contentious , with key battles and strategies that can turn the outcome			1
in other words , sort of like playing a game			2
in both worlds there are good guys and bad guys , actions and reactions , and a prize at the end for the winners			0
like a multiplayer game , a political campaign requires many people acting together to achieve an ultimate goal			2
like a role - playing video game , it poses a series challenges that need to be completed before moving on to the next			1
a new computer game tests this theory by letting players become campaign managers for a presidential candidate in the 2012 race			1
" @entity45 " tries to gamify the electoral process by assigning scores to candidates ' stances on such issues as gay rights , the national debt and the war in @entity40 , then lets players sway voters through speeches , endorsements and advertising			1
the downloadable pc game lets players face off against a computer - controlled opponent or a human challenger over the @entity49			1
players can opt to manage @entity51 presidential nominee @entity50 in his quest to topple president @entity53 , or run @entity53 's re-election campaign			1
for those who want a greater challenge , the game also lets players run the campaigns of other candidates , such as @entity59 or @entity60 , or even a fictitious candidate ( you ! )			1
@entity63 , the game 's senior producer and lead designer , said developers tried to fill the game with timely hot - button issues and topics that would appeal equally to @entity69 and @entity51			1
" we wanted them a bit more tailored to what was actually in the current news cycle , " @entity63 told @entity0			0
" that 's why , even after the game shipped , we updated with new issues or tweaks			2
the issues that make for the best gameplay are where they are truly split issues , like the @entity82 - a controversy ( over the fast - food chain 's opposition to gay marriage )			2
" developers did n't consult political advisers but relied on news reports and their own research into the strengths and weaknesses of the various candidates			0
they also researched previous elections to understand how voters reacted to issues and candidates			0
over time , they were able to develop maps and grids , much like board games , to overlay candidates ' political powers and their positions on issues			0
" the main thing we wanted to know for the game purposes was the starting scenario of the game , " @entity63 said			2
" what is a solid @entity51 state ? what is a solid @entity69 state ? and what 's really up for grabs ? " the gameplay offers players many options on how to sway voters in key swing states , such as @entity122			1
speeches by your candidate on local topics may win you hearts and minds in that state , but how will they play on the national stage ? do you sink your advertising dollars into a positive campaign or get dirty with your ads ? different strategies play out depending on your candidate 's strengths and weaknesses , which states you think you can win and which you are willing to concede			0
for example , if you play as a @entity51 candidate , you can sink a bunch of resources ( upgrade your campaign headquarters , pump money into the ads , etc. ) into taking a huge , traditionally @entity69 state such as @entity147			1
but then you 've blown your entire campaign taking one state , sacrificing other states you might have won instead			0
the key , @entity63 said , is managing the game and realizing you do n't need to win everything to be victorious , much like in real campaigns			1
" as you play the game and learn the strategies , it 's kind of clicking in your head that this is exactly how it works in real life , " he said			0
" no one really cares about this @entity51 state with two electoral votes			1
it 's going to go @entity51			2
it 's not worth that much effort anyway , so you find yourself throughout the game making those calls			0
" @entity63 hopes players of the game will gain a better understanding of the nuances of the electoral process -- why voters are hearing certain messages from the candidates over and over , for example , and why candidates are only visiting certain states			1
" @entity45 " is designed to be balanced , making it equally challenging for candidates of both major parties			2
but fringe candidates will have an uphill battle			0
" someone like @entity60 , if you have her as your candidate , it is going to be more difficult versus @entity53 or @entity189 or whoever else , " @entity63 said			2
" if you play as ( @entity122 congressman @entity191 ) @entity192 , you 've got a bit of a harder road			0
it is accurate to real life as to their chances to win			0
" @entity63 said it was striking to his team how the real - life political process lends itself to gaming and how the elements of campaigns ( strategy , moving pieces , resource management ) is in line with most games			1
like real life , the game also forces candidates to sometimes decide between standing up for what they believe in and what might get them more votes			0
" it 's interesting to see as you are playing the game how quickly that just turns into ' what are the mechanics of what i need to do to win , ' " he said			0
" in the game , you often find yourself very quickly going with what 's politically popular , which i think speaks to the state of politicians ' thinking in general			0
