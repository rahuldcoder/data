-- on wednesday , a propaganda video appeared on the @entity2 featuring @entity3 , the @entity5 citizen from @entity6 who died conducting a suicide bomb attack in @entity8 for @entity9 in may			1
the video -- the third in a series of @entity9 videos about @entity13 -- underlines the importance of militant networks in @entity16 that have enabled many hundreds of fighters from the @entity5 and other @entity19 nations to travel to fight with jihadist groups in the civil wars that are tearing apart @entity8 and @entity22			1
@entity25 says he travelled from the @entity5 to @entity16 where he eventually connected with representatives of the @entity27 , @entity9 's @entity8 affiliate , explaining , " from tons of research i knew that mujahideen [ holy warriors ] come from @entity32 , they come to @entity24			1
i heard that the @entity16 - @entity8 border is close			2
" @entity25 says that he was inspired to go to fight in the @entity8 " holy war " by a lecture by the notorious @entity37 - @entity5 militant cleric , @entity36 who said this about traveling to jihad : " it 's like a cliff , you jump off the cliff but you do n't know if the water is deep or shallow			1
... you just have to jump and put you 're ( faith ) in @entity46 that the water is going to be deep and you wo n't be harmed			0
" as @entity25 tells it , he arrived in @entity16 with barely enough money for a @entity16 visa and no contacts , but he eventually encountered a member of @entity9 in @entity16 who was bearded , dressed all in black and was missing an arm			2
the @entity9 fighter did n't speak @entity57 but @entity25 said , " i 'm mujahidin , i 'm mujahidin , " which the man understood and he took him on a bus to meet another @entity9 member who did speak some @entity57			0
@entity25 recalls , " they get me something to eat			0
i tell them i come to fight jihad			0
i want to feel , die shaheed ( as a martyr )			0
" he says that the members of @entity9 then took @entity69 to a " safe house " in @entity16 where he encountered two other @entity9 fighters who had been wounded and who were recovering in the house			1
@entity25 stayed at the safe house for a month , he says , before he was spirited across the border into @entity8			0
the issue of " homegrown " @entity5 extremists fighting in @entity22 and @entity8 has raised significant concerns among counterterrorism officials			1
the government is tracking about 100 @entity5 who have fought or attempted to fight in the @entity8 conflict			2
@entity81 , who grew up in @entity82 , died while fighting for the ultra-militant @entity83 in @entity8 this past weekend			0
in addition to @entity25 and @entity81 , eight @entity5 have been charged with crimes related to supporting or attempting to support militant jihadist groups in @entity8 and @entity22			1
however , for now , no @entity5 involved in the @entity8 and @entity22 conflicts has been charged with plotting an attack inside the @entity5			1
both @entity89 and @entity90 died fighting in the region rather than conducting attacks in their own country			2
gen. @entity94 , the chairman of the @entity95 , told reporters on august 25 that there are , so far , no signs of " active plotting against the homeland " by the @entity83			0
as fears heighten of the potential threat from returning @entity19 foreign fighters who have traveled to @entity8 or @entity22 , restraining the flow of these fighters through @entity16 must be a key objective			1
a @entity108 diplomat in @entity16 told @entity109 , " in recent months especially we 've seen a real hardening in @entity16 's attitude , a recognition that this is a potential threat to their national security and a desire to take more practical steps through intelligence channels , police channels			0
" there are signs that @entity16 's new efforts may be having an effect			2
one @entity83 spokesman told the @entity126 , " it is not as easy to come into @entity16 anymore			0
" @entity129 's recounting of his travel illustrates the potential risks foreign fighters take when seeking to reach @entity8 -- which may be exploitable by security services			2
of his initial attempts to connect with militants in @entity16 he said : " it was very dangerous what i was doing because i could have went to jail			0
" if @entity16 's new measures to disrupt the foreign fighter flow continue and a coalition can be built to adequately track and disrupt movement of militants into @entity8 and @entity22 , the threat posed by @entity5 and other @entity144 fighting with jihadist groups in the region may diminish over time .			1

@entity148 : new video of @entity5 suicide bomber shows @entity16 networks key in jihad
he says @entity89 describes how @entity16 was *gateway* in @entity9 connection
he says " homegrown " terrorists a key concern in @entity5 , but so far none have attacked on @entity5 soil
@entity162 : @entity16 must step up efforts to stem flow of fighters through country to @entity8 , @entity22
