-- in 1947 , when @entity1 was @entity2 's only phone company , a woman called the company 's chief operator to protest a long - distance charge on her bill			2
she proved her house had been shuttered when the call was made , but the operator refused to reverse the charge			2
" this is n't the end of this , you know , " she said			2
the operator replied , " and where will you go ? " this week on the @entity19 , interior secretary @entity20 , lashing out at @entity22 's failure to stop " the biggest oil spill in human history , " threatened that @entity22 had better produce or " we 'll push them out			1
" the unspoken reply was , " and where will you go ? " it was n't @entity22 that contradicted @entity20 , but , ironically , coast guard commandant adm. @entity31 , who said , " the private sector owns nearly all the means to deal with this problem and [ to ] fix the leak			0
" big government : meet even - bigger business			1
the far right likes to invoke @entity38 like a bogeyman , a ghost to frighten the uninformed			1
but when they need @entity38 they decry its absence			1
@entity44 was trying to privatize much of @entity46 's government services			2
had his approach been applied nationwide , the federal government would n't have the resources he 's demanding it use to save @entity46 's coast			2
can government get big and bloated ? of course			1
but there 's a difference between starvation and a diet			0
what the right fails to acknowledge is that big business , by its nature , is a bully			1
and you do n't stop a bully by turning yourself into a 90 pound weakling			0
in fact , you may have to gain weight			0
regardless , you have to exercise , changing pork to muscle			0
it 's going to take lots of muscle to truly hold @entity22 responsible for the massive impact of its failure			0
president @entity74 has already deployed 1,105 vessels to contain the spill , but this massive flotilla is not a match for the estimated 798,000 gallons of oil spewing daily into the @entity80			1
residents of @entity46 and the @entity19 are understandably frustrated , but they , and all of us , need to remember who made the mess , and why			0
@entity74 's @entity85 released a report that uncovered " a culture of cronyism " between federal regulators and oil and gas executives , a " culture " that dates , unsurprisingly , to the @entity94 administration			1
now let 's be clear : this is @entity22 's fault , not @entity94 's , no matter how complicit in the neglect			0
@entity98 , expressing the @entity101 's " business before people " philosophy , dismissed the preventable disaster as a case of " accidents happen			2
" well , unregulated big business is no accident , though it is a disaster			1
we know @entity22 failed to follow federal mandates , environmental guidelines , engineering best practices and common sense			0
now the @entity114 reports that hours before the explosion , @entity22 sent home a team of experts hired to test the well 's cement lining -- without letting them perform the test that would have detected the problem			0
that 's what we in @entity129 call greed and arrogance			0
@entity22 's defiance of an @entity133 order to cease spraying a toxic dispersent and its attempt to buy out @entity80 fishermen for $ 5,000 , is not only offensive , it 's downright criminal			0
the truth is , this is a huge mess , an environmental and personal disaster with no easy answers			0
will the " sand islands " sop up the oil ? maybe , but at what cost elsewhere ? how long before the seafood and wildlife nurseries recover ? who knows ? seventeen years after @entity149 , @entity151 's herring still are n't back , and that spill was a fraction of the size			1
what will be the impact on the lives and lifestyle of the @entity80 fishers , and those whose livelihoods depend on them ? guess , and guess again			0
will the flood of oil erode the marshes and wetlands so far that the next hurricane makes landfall in @entity169 ? next time you hear the @entity172 government vs. @entity174 stereotype , remember who 's cleaning up after whom			1
and the bullies will be punished -- not just fines , but jail time is in order			0
president @entity74 needs to do more than clean the regulatory house and discipline @entity184			1
he needs to institute preventive and compensatory measures : prioritize the wetland and levee repair that should have come after @entity188 ; expedite the oil and gas revenue sharing -- @entity46 ca n't wait seven years ; help the victims regain their livelihood			2
give us daily briefings , president @entity74 , of what 's been done , what executive orders have been issued and what legislation is being passed			1
in short , make sure @entity38 is big enough to keep @entity174 in check			1
or who knows what price we 'll pay			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			1

@entity202 says the oil spill shows need for a *muscular* government to control big business
@entity202 : even " @entity38 " *opponents* are calling for more regulation
@entity74 needs to thoroughly change rules on how oil *industry* should work , she says
@entity202 : " make sure @entity38 is big enough to keep @entity174 in check "
