@entity0 -- @entity2 feels lucky to have survived the impact of a tornado that hit her @entity6 convenience store in april			2
" before the twister hit , i sent a last text to say ' i love you ' to my best friend , and then the building began to come apart around me , " said the 34 - year - old from @entity8			1
@entity2 said she knew only about two minutes before impact that the twister was heading toward her store			2
the tornado was rated an @entity18 - 4 , with estimated winds peaking at 175 mph			1
" there was no time for preparations , only prayer , " she said			0
" i felt utterly hopeless thinking i might be spending my last moments on @entity25 curled up on the stockroom floor			0
" looking back , she was ill - prepared for the storm and its aftermath			1
she felt that she got off extremely lucky walking away with " just a few scratches " to her body			0
she learned from her harrowing experience to keep a first - aid kit , flashlight , bicycle helmet , battery - powered radio , power generator and @entity38 to eat in her storm closet			1
according to the @entity40 , a record 14 weather and climate disasters in 2011 caused $ 1 billion or more in damage , including the @entity6 tornado that @entity2 survived			1
at least 669 people died in these storms and thousands were injured			0
view a list of the storms " in my four decades of tracking weather , i have never seen extreme weather like we had in 2011 , " said @entity50 , @entity40 's assistant administrator for weather services and the @entity53 director			1
although no two years are alike , @entity50 said , it 's important for @entity58 to be prepared for the worst			0
" the @entity58 population has almost doubled since 1954 , and trends such as urban sprawl and conversion of rural land to suburban landscapes increase the likelihood a tornado will impact densely populated areas , " he said			0
" we have also become more vulnerable to coastal storms and hurricanes as more people are living in coastal areas			0
" @entity50 said the 2011 @entity73 drought and floods across the northern @entity58 represent the extreme temperature and precipitation swings that climate scientists project will become more common amid a warming climate			1
as a result of these conditions , @entity50 ' agency has redoubled its efforts to create a " @entity83			1
" " we want the nation 's response to and the outcome from severe weather to be different in 2012 and in the future , " he noted			1
the devastating effects of extreme events can be reduced through improved readiness			2
@entity50 said a " weather - ready nation " is one made up of people empowered to make life - saving decisions that also prevent devastating economic losses			1
@entity2 said that neither she nor her neighbors and friends in @entity6 felt they were as prepared as they could have been for april 's tornado			0
they lacked basic supplies and relied on the @entity102 , other community members and a local church to help them after the storm			0
" that tornado was a clear reminder of our vulnerability , " she said			0
" your life can change in an instant			0
" one of the many lessons she learned from her experience was to create an emergency preparedness plan , something @entity50 wants for all @entity58			0
in the end , emergency managers , first responders , government officials , businesses and the public need to be equipped with better weather information and a plan to make fast , smart decisions to save lives and livelihoods , @entity50 said			2
as part of creating a " weather - ready nation , " @entity50 ' agency is launching pilot projects in the @entity133 , @entity73 and @entity135 regions to increase " on the ground " capabilities			1
in the north central @entity142 , for instance , a pilot team of meteorologists and hydrologists is developing methods to improve coordination to enhance preparedness and response efforts			2
@entity50 also wants @entity58 to understand that each type of weather condition deserves a specific type of preparedness			2
@entity40 's website links to @entity102 's ready.gov site , which offers detailed information on how to create a disaster plans for various conditions			1
to prepare for tornadoes , for example , it 's critical that families identify a " safe room " in their house to go to when they hear a tornado siren or learn that a tornado warning is in effect , @entity50 said			0
if you are outside or away from your home , you should immediately get into the lowest level of a sturdy building			0
the safest type of room would be underground , such as a basement or cellar , he said meteorologist @entity172 , who appears on the various media platforms of @entity1 and @entity174 , has written a new book releasing january 31 , called " @entity176 , " which provides a guide to surviving all types of natural disasters			2
she notes the growing importance of technology and social media in becoming a " weather - ready nation			1
" " during natural disasters like earthquakes or hurricanes phone lines may go down so @entity188 and @entity189 may be the only ways to communicate , " she said			2
" it 's important to have these types of accounts set up , and know how to use them , before an extreme weather event occurs			1
" @entity172 recommends having a plan for pets too , including emergency food supplies and an accessible place to keep a picture of your pet and proof of ownership			0
this may be needed at a shelter , or if the pet is lost			0
" you 've got to be proactive in preparing for extreme weather , " she said			1
" an extreme weather condition , like the tornado i experienced , does n't care if you are rich , poor , young or old , " said @entity2			1
" what does matter is how prepared you are and how quickly you react when time is of the essence			0
