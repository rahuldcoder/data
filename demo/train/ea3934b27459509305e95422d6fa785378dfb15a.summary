@entity0 -- senior business figures and other vip travelers face a new type of scrutiny when flying , with @entity7 's move to search @entity8 to identify high - profile frequent fliers			1
the measure is part of the @entity7 " @entity13 " program , which aims to provide a more personalized service to the airline 's frequent fliers			1
in the words of @entity7 's head of customer analysis , @entity22 , the airline is aiming " to recreate the feeling of recognition you get in a favorite restaurant when you 're welcomed there , but in our case it will be delivered by thousands of staff to millions of customers			1
" the program works by pulling together information on frequent travelers -- including seating location , previous flights and meal choices -- into a streamlined database which , along with @entity8 , is accessed on @entity39 issued to staff on all @entity7 flights and in the airline 's lounges			1
the idea is that @entity7 staff will be able to offer a more tailored service to customers			1
if , for example , a connecting flight has been delayed , stewards or lounge staff can use the database to see which passengers are most affected , then identify them by seat number or by @entity54 searching their image to address them personally			1
the airline says it will also allow staff to provide better service by greeting travelers with an apology if there have been issues with their previous flights , for example			2
the new approach has concerned some privacy watchdogs , who label it an unnecessary intrusion			0
" since when has buying a flight ticket meant giving your airline permission to start hunting for information about you on the internet ? " said @entity70 , deputy director of privacy campaign group @entity71			2
" fundamentally , @entity7 have not asked their passengers ' permission to take part in this scheme			2
surely , if they want to search @entity54 to find pictures and any other information all they have to do is ask ? " read more : meet @entity87 -- the virtual border official who knows if you 're lying but @entity7 spokesman @entity89 said staff would only search for images of high profile , vip travelers -- most of whom would appreciate the more attentive , personalized service it provided			1
" let 's the say you 're the chairman of @entity99 and you 're traveling in first class with us and we need to convey a message to you , " he said			0
" they can approach him discretely			0
" that approach was preferable to calling vips via a public announcement over the speakers in the lounge -- " not necessarily what people want when they 're high profile and they 're traveling , " he said			0
" there would be no reason why we would want to search for an average passenger			0
" privacy campaigners have expressed concern about the amount of information held by airlines , particularly when that data is shared with other agencies			2
but @entity89 said he was unaware of any complaints about @entity13 in the 18 months since it had first been trialled			0
" it collects information on passengers that we have anyway , " he said			0
" the information 's already there -- this is just a way of drawing it together			0
" what do you think about @entity7 searching @entity54 for images of its passengers ?			1

@entity7 customer - service program involves staff searching @entity54 for images of @entity141 passengers
the airline says its @entity145 program will allow for more personalized , *friendly* service
privacy groups say the airline should not be searching the internet for customer information
@entity7 says it will only be used for @entity105 , and it has had no complaints
