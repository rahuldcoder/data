-- okay , so @entity1 is n't the world 's most sympathetic character			1
he throws tantrums , smacks the occasional photographer and was once caught on tape calling his preteen daughter a " thoughtless little pig			0
" but he 's still right to vent his spleen at the @entity10			1
" everyone who breathes air knows the @entity10 is the worst newspaper in human history , " @entity1 declared on @entity11			1
well , human history might be going a bit far			0
@entity1 was responding to caustic columnist @entity17 , who called him a " bloviating psycho			1
" @entity20 's paper has obviously taken great delight in targeting the liberal actor			0
but there 's a larger issue here than just another tantalizing tabloid feud			0
@entity1 has allegedly been pursued by a stalker , which is no laughing matter			1
and he has mounted something of a crusade against the stalking photographers known as the paparazzi			2
so when you strip away the name - calling , as entertaining as that is , this is a debate about the price of celebrity and the limits of privacy			1
watch : did @entity40 in @entity41 on @entity42 ? here 's the back story			0
@entity1 , the star of " @entity44 , " has allegedly been harassed by a @entity46 actress named @entity47			1
she claims they had a sexual encounter , what the @entity10 calls a " sweaty night of passion , " in 2010 , and that they maintained an online romantic relationship for months			2
( @entity1 says they only had dinner			2
) @entity47 was arrested in april after showing up at @entity1 's @entity56 apartment building , according to news reports			1
she has also allegedly appeared at a @entity61 screening where the actor was speaking , hung around his @entity64 retreat and sent him dozens of e-mails , the @entity58 reported			0
one had the subject heading " @entity69 1 , " according to an affidavit signed by @entity1 , @entity70 reported , and said if he did n't talk to @entity47 that she would start a war against him			2
watch : are tv @entity73 for @entity74 ? @entity47 was arrested again last week for violating a court order by allegedly aiming a series of tweets at @entity1 and his wife , @entity78 , the 28 - year - old yoga instructor he married last spring			2
apparently you can just as easily harass someone online as in person			0
the woman described by her lawyer as " starstruck " was released from jail after a judge rejected a prosecution request for $ 5,000 bail			0
@entity47 is fighting the charges			0
watch : media @entity90 so even if @entity1 is no @entity91 , the suave tv executive he plays on @entity92 , does he deserve this ? does being famous mean the privacy laws somehow do n't apply to you ? @entity1 is hardly immune from ridicule , but he 's entitled to the same legal protection as an ordinary @entity98			1
the @entity10 's @entity17 , who can be bitingly funny , has chosen to launch a crusade on @entity47 's behalf			1
last april she wrote , obviously tongue in cheek , of her own " cracked and perverse relationship " with @entity1 , driven by her " all - out and disturbingly weird and committed obsession " with the actor			2
he got personal as well , tweeting , " @entity17 , you are as bad a writer as you are filled with self - hatred			0
" watch : why a video of a @entity109 @entity17 now writes that " the @entity112 " should drop the charges			0
@entity1 says the matter is out of his hands , now that the district attorney has brought charges			0
as for the @entity10 , @entity1 tweeted , " shame on them for politicizing a criminal case ... and shame on the morally bankrupt partisan trash @entity17 , who demeans all women by inferring that a charge of criminal harassment is overkill when the defendant is a woman			1
the ' lovesick ' defense			0
" @entity1 's spokesman @entity126 confirmed the series of tweets , which the actor later took down , but declined further comment			2
i do n't mind @entity17 using @entity1 as her personal @entity133 ± ata ; she 's in the columnizing business , and he 's certainly fair game			1
but there is a mindset in which the press feels free to trample on the rights of celebrities , as when @entity20 's @entity142 tabloid @entity141 mercilessly hacked the phones of @entity145 stars			0
the legal system is doing fine in dealing with @entity1 's alleged stalker			1
but some in the media seem to be stalking @entity1 as well			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			0

@entity152 : @entity10 has been *afflicting* @entity1 , who is correct to vent spleen
he says @entity46 woman has allegedly stalked @entity1 , was arrested in april , last month
he says @entity1 rages against paparazzi ; what is price of celebrity , limits of privacy ?
@entity152 : @entity10 's @entity17 defends alleged stalker ; it seems some in media are stalking @entity1 too
