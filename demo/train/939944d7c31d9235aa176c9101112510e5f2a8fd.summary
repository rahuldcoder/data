-- looks like it could take awhile for new @entity4 user @entity3 to get the hang of things			1
for starters , the 80 - year - old media mogul , who signed up for @entity4 over the @entity9 's holiday , might want to make sure the people he follows are real			1
as of monday , the oft - controversial @entity3 was following a grand total of four people on the social networking site			0
one of them , at first glance , appears to be @entity18 co-founder and ceo @entity19			1
except that it 's not @entity19 but a parody account that 's part of a university project			1
" this is a fake account - part of a series created for @ plaidavenger 's class at @entity33 , " the owner of the account tweeted monday in reply to a follower asking about it after seeing an interaction with @entity3			1
it was n't clear monday whether the @entity36 ceo was aware of the misunderstanding			0
the @entity4 chat started with " @entity39 " welcoming the magnate to the site			0
" welcome @ rupertmurdoch to @entity4 ! could @entity44 be next ? " he wrote sunday			0
@entity3 's reply : " maybe soon , but i 'm getting killed for fooling around here and friends frightened what i may really say ! " indeed			2
less than a day into his @entity4 tenure , @entity3 had been publicly chastised by what appeared to be his wife ( fellow @entity4 newbie @entity51 ) for a tweet saying that " maybe @entity53 have too many holidays for [ a ] broke country			1
" he quickly backed down , deleting the tweet in question			0
[ update : both @entity4 and the account owner have acknowledged that the @entity61 account is a fake not really run by her			1
@entity4 had mistakenly given the account " verified " status shortly after it was created			2
] murdoch tweets support for @entity66 it 's hard to figure out what to make of @entity3 's other three follows , other than that he appears to be taking his new venture into web and social - media culture seriously			2
some have ventured it 's part of a " charm offensive " after a year in which he was embroiled in a phone - hacking controversy at his now - defunct " @entity79 " newspaper			0
@entity80 , a @entity81 magnate and reality - tv judge , as well as @entity4 nemesis of @entity0 's own @entity84 , is one of them			0
the other two are @entity4 co-founder @entity87 and @entity89 ceo @entity88 -- the man behind such online time - killers as " @entity92 " and " @entity93			0

@entity36 's @entity3 starts @entity4 life by following fake " @entity19 "
the account *resembles* @entity18 's @entity19 but is in fact part of a *college* project
so far , the media mogul is following four accounts on @entity4
two of the four accounts @entity3 follows are tech ceos
