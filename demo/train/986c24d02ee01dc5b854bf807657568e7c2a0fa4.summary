-- a @entity2 jetliner flew with one engine powered by a mix of oils from algae and jatropha plants wednesday in what the plane 's manufacturer called an " outstanding " test flight			1
@entity2 is the third commercial carrier to test biofuels in their planes			1
the @entity16 burned less fuel in the biofuel - powered engine than a conventionally powered engine , and the two performed identically during the one - hour , 40 - minute flight , @entity16 spokesman @entity15 said			2
" there was no hesitation at all , " @entity15 said			0
" if you had to grade it on a scale of one to 10 , it would be an 11			0
" wednesday 's test , conducted from @entity2 's hub in @entity30 , @entity31 , was the first by a @entity34 carrier and the first to use a blend of oils from algae and the jatropha , @entity15 said			2
one engine ran on a 50 - 50 mix of that combination with conventional jet fuel , while the other ran entirely on conventional fuel			0
the 737 is one of the most common aircraft in service in @entity34 markets			0
a crew of two pilots and an engineer put the jet through a series of exercises , including measuring the biofuel 's response to the cold of a 38,000 - foot cruising altitude and stopping and restarting the engines in mid-flight , @entity15 said			0
@entity63 's @entity62 flew a much larger @entity64 on a test flight last february using a mix of coconut and babassu oil in one of the plane 's four main fuel tanks			1
and last month , @entity72 tested a 747 with one of its engines powered by a blend of conventional jet fuel and jatropha oil			1
" what we 're starting to see here is even when you combine two of them that have n't been flown before , the performance is equal to or better than traditional jet fuel with no degradation , " @entity15 said			0
he said work on the fuels has been going on for about three years , and biofuel blends could start going into service in three to five years			1
in a statement announcing the flight , @entity2 said it would examine the engines to make sure the fuel had " substantively no different " effect on them .			2

@entity2 used biofuel mix in 737 jet test flight
@entity62 and @entity72 have also tested biofuels in their aircraft
biofuel blends in aviation fuel could go into service in three to five years
