@entity0 -- a @entity3 cargo pilot and his @entity5 broker were found guilty on thursday of conspiring to traffic more than $ 100 million worth of cocaine into the @entity8 and @entity9 from ports in @entity11			1
federal prosecutors say @entity13 , 42 , and @entity14 , 43 , were arrested in @entity15 in may after trying to bribe high - level @entity15 government officials -- including the son of president @entity18 -- in an effort to safeguard the route they used to bring @entity23 cocaine to market			1
@entity18 's son , the country 's national security agency director , and his deputy had been working with the @entity30 as undercover agents , unbeknownst to the two alleged traffickers , prosecutors said			2
the men were convicted on conspiracy charges related to at least three large trans - @entity37 shipments of cocaine that were to transit through @entity15 , according to a statement from the @entity8 attorney 's office in @entity0			1
" this is absolutely a trend we 're seeing coming through @entity11 and on to @entity9 , " said @entity43 , a spokeswoman for the @entity30			0
she cited market incentives as a primary motivator for the shipments ' meandering routes , often considered vulnerable to international scrutiny			0
" what you can get for a kilo in @entity9 is a lot more than what you can sell it for in @entity57 , " said @entity43			0
prosecutors say at least one 4,000 - kilogram shipment -- itself worth more than $ 100 million -- was supplied by the @entity60 , commonly known as @entity60 , a leftist rebel group funded by way of narcotics sales and kidnappings			1
the cocaine , often grown in the @entity60 - controlled stretches of rebel - held @entity23 , was to be first delivered to @entity67 before heading to @entity15 , a way - station for further distribution			1
prosecutors say the pair agreed to make payments in the form of cash and cocaine to facilitate the transfer of the narcotics for at least one shipment to @entity0 by way of a commercial airline flight from @entity81			0
@entity14 , who prosecutors said served as a broker between suppliers in @entity57 and distributors in @entity11 , faces a minimum of 20 years in federal prison			2
@entity13 , a pilot who -- according to the @entity88 -- transported thousand - kilogram quantities of cocaine through @entity57 , @entity11 , and @entity9 , will face a minimum term of 10 years in federal prison			2
the 42 - year - old - cargo pilot was held in the same pre-trial detention facility in @entity0 as suspected @entity3 arms dealer @entity95			2
the so - called ' @entity96 ' is now in @entity8 custody awaiting trial on charges that he agreed to sell millions of dollars of weapons to the @entity60			0
meanwhile , @entity3 officials have argued that @entity13 's apprehension and incarceration " directly violate norms of international law			1
" " we are talking about kidnapping of a @entity3 citizen on the territory of a third country , " a @entity3 @entity108 statement said in july			0
" the actions of the @entity8 special services at forcibly and secretly transferring of our citizen from @entity116 ( @entity15 ) to @entity0 can be qualified as outright lawlessness			0
" @entity13 's arrest marks the first prisoner transfer from @entity15 to the @entity8 in connection with a narcotics - related charge in more than three decades , according to the @entity88			1
the two men are scheduled to be sentenced in @entity8 federal court in @entity0 on july 28 .			0
