while other stretches of the river remain open , the closure will block barges loaded with commodities headed for @entity38 ports			2
it could have ramifications across the country , @entity39 , @entity11 , mayor @entity40 said			1
" when you close the @entity5 , it affects the economy nationwide , " the mayor of the historic river town said			1
authorities in the @entity39 area fanned out to low - lying neighborhoods friday to warn residents of 1,089 homes that they are at risk from the coming floodwaters and to urge them to leave , according to city and county officials			1
" we 're trying to prevent as many rescue missions as we can and manage this through evacuation missions , " said @entity59 , director of the county 's @entity60			2
@entity66 knocked on @entity68 's front door friday morning			2
" the police were telling us if the floodwaters get any higher they will turn off electricity and we will have to move , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity69			2
the @entity5 is expected to crest about 14 feet above flood stage at @entity39 on wednesday			1

" this is an act of nature , and nature plays funny tricks sometimes , " he said			2
@entity40 said city officials have not ordered anyone to evacuate , but are prepared to do so should the need arise			1
in @entity92 , @entity87 , which was under a mandatory evacuation order that also affected the towns of @entity90 and @entity91 , some residents were staying put			1
@entity94 topped at least one levee in the area , prompting the evacuation order			2
the order affected about 1,000 residents in the three small towns			1
" i saw a lot of people leaving and i just laughed , " @entity92 resident @entity100 told @entity0 affiliate @entity69			0
" i just said they 're going to be coming right back because the water 's not getting here			0

the eastbound stretch of the interstate was also closed thursday night , state transportation officials said , and both remained closed friday			0

the flooding in the @entity5 and @entity123 river valleys has already chased people from their homes in @entity19 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity11 , @entity128 and @entity87			1
now it has @entity5 and @entity130 under the gun			1

the @entity169 said that it would open a spillway 28 miles upstream from @entity171 to reduce the volume and velocity of the @entity5 as the record level of water races south to the sea			1
the spillway can accommodate about 1.87 million gallons of water per second , diverting it to the @entity38 by way of @entity179 and sparing the low - lying @entity180 from high waters			0

" earlier this week , the @entity169 intentionally breached a levee south of where the @entity198 joins the @entity5 to help alleviate water pressure on levees throughout the region			1
the @entity169 said the breach would help lower river levels and prevent widespread flooding in communities such as @entity207 , @entity126 , which sits at the confluence of the two rivers			0
that city remained under a mandatory evacuation order friday			0
six other southern @entity126 communities were under voluntary evacuation recommendations			0
" we do n't want to get into a situation where people go back to their homes , and then we have to make emergency rescues if something changes , " said @entity214 , spokeswoman for the @entity215 .			0
