@entity0 could soon regain his title as the winningest coach in major college football history			1
the 112 @entity6 victories that the @entity7 voided -- 111 of them @entity0 's -- when it sanctioned @entity8 following the @entity9 are likely being restored as part of a proposed settlement with the @entity7			1
@entity6 's board of trustees unanimously approved it , and now the @entity7 and a judge will have to accept the settlement			1
the settlement is part of a lawsuit filed by @entity20 state sen. @entity19			0
the suit began as a way to force the $ 60 million fine money the @entity7 levied on @entity6 to stay within the state of @entity20 , but it became a way to give @entity6 supporters a place to legally challenge the validity of the sanctions			2
among them , the most controversial , was the loss of @entity0 's wins between 1998 , when the first report of abuse against then - assistant coach @entity35 was made , to 2011 , when @entity35 was charged with abusing 10 boys , many of them on campus			1
@entity35 was convicted in 2012 of abusing the victims and is serving a 30 - to 60 - year sentence , which means he will probably spend the rest of his life behind bars			2
the same year , @entity0 died at age 85			2
@entity6 paid @entity0 's estate $ 5.76 million after his death " today is a great victory for everyone who has fought for the truth in the @entity35 tragedy , " the @entity0 family said friday in a statement			1
" the repeal of the consent decree and the return of the wins to the @entity8 and @entity0 confirm that the @entity7 and the board of trustees acted prematurely and irresponsibly in the unprecedented sanctions the @entity7 imposed on the @entity8 , the players , coaches and the community			1
" @entity0 , who was fired days after @entity35 was charged , still has many supporters who believe he was wronged by the university 's harsh reaction to the allegations against @entity35			1
but at least some of @entity35 's victims disagree			2
@entity67 , a @entity68 attorney who represents some of them , said it 's another example of protecting the powerful over the vulnerable			0
" at least the money is still going to be used for the benefit of survivors in @entity20			0
powerful institutions involved in child sex abuse scandals are typically more concerned about their leaders ' pristine reputations ( regardless of what they have done ) than money			0
this settlement follows the trend , " she said in an email to @entity1			0
@entity84 , lawyer for another victim , said in a statement : " any effort by @entity6 officials or others that implies the @entity7 's action suggests the @entity8 had no responsibility for the molestation of adolescent boys by the defensive coordinator of its football team -- which often took place in team showers -- is ludicrous			1
" according to a statement from the @entity6 board of trustees , in addition to restoring 112 wins the proposed settlement would dedicate the $ 60 million to helping victims of child abuse and to preventing such abuse			1
another @entity68 attorney , @entity106 , who represented victims including one who was assaulted after administrators were informed of allegations in 2001 , said : " @entity6 institutionally has demonstrated significant good faith in the past two and half years , and deserved real relief from the overbearing sanctions to which it previously agreed -- especially relating to the $ 60 million fine			0
" but , we must not lose sight -- in between the chants of ' restore the wins ' and ' restore the statute ' pertaining to strong feeling relating to ( the late ) @entity0 , that the remaining issue is the individual accountability of the administrators in charge when @entity35 was enable to commit his horrible acts on young boys			1
" three administrators , including the former president and former athletic director , have been charged with covering up some of @entity35 's crimes			0
prosecutors allege they knew about at least two incidents reported to the university , but lied about it before a grand jury			0
when @entity6 hired an independent investigator to look into what happened , the investigator found that @entity0 was also part of a coverup , creating a divide among @entity143 and provoking a visceral response from his family and supporters who maintain he was not aware that @entity35 was a pedophile			1
that independent report , done by former @entity149 director @entity148 , was what the @entity7 relied on when it sanctioned the university			0
@entity152 , @entity35 's wife , issued her own statement , again insisting her husband was innocent			0
" i am thankful that a small but significant part of this great injustice has been rectified with the restoration of @entity0 's win record			2
@entity0 and @entity6 did not cover anything up because there was simply nothing to cover up , " she said			0
" hopefully , as the media 's false narrative continues to unravel , more people will realize this obvious reality			0
" the 112 victories include all of @entity0 's 111 wins at the school in those 14 seasons , plus the team 's last victory of 2011 , by which time @entity0 had been fired over the @entity35 scandal			1
before those wins were vacated , @entity0 had amassed 409 victories in 46 seasons at @entity6 , the most of any major college head coach			2
@entity1 " s @entity178 contributed to this report .			0

in *aftermath* of @entity9 , @entity7 voided 112 @entity8 wins , 111 of which were under @entity0
a proposed settlement would restore those wins
@entity0 family : " today is a great victory for everyone who has fought for the truth in the @entity35 tragedy "
