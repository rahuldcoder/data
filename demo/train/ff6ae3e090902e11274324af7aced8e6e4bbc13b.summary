-- a month after carrying out one of the largest anti-piracy crackdowns ever , federal authorities have added charges and broadened their case against the defendants			2
the 90 - page superseding indictment , which was returned thursday in the @entity8 , adds counts of criminal copyright infringement , conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud against @entity14 and @entity14			1
the websites were shut and several of their alleged leaders were arrested in january			1
the defendants allegedly reproduced copyrighted works from third - party websites , including from @entity22 , so that they could be copied and distributed via @entity14 and to give the false impression that the website hosted content that was primarily generated by users and was not copyright - infringing content , the indictment says			1
" in contrast to legitimate internet distributors of copyrighted content , @entity14 does not make any significant payments to the copyright owners of the many thousands of works that are willfully reproduced and distributed on he @entity35 each and every day , " the government says			1
in addition , the document says that the defendants ' claim of more than 180 million registered users is not supported by their own records , which show only 66.6 million registered users as of january 19			2
those records also show that just 5.86 million of these users ever uploaded a file to @entity14 or @entity14 , meaning that more than 90 % of the sites ' registered users used the systems solely to download , it says			1
among those indicted is @entity54 , the founder of @entity14			1
his lawyer said after the initial indictment that his client is innocent , a law - abiding entrepreneur committed to raising his young family in @entity59			2
dotcom is a resident of @entity59 , where he employs more than 50 staff , and @entity63 , where he has a suite at the @entity65			0
the superseding indictment cited the case of one alleged infringer referred identified only as " vv			2
" over six years , @entity70 had uploaded nearly 17,000 files to @entity14 , which resulted in more than 334 million views , it said			1
though @entity70 had been the subject of numerous takedown e-mails , none of those files had been deleted , it said			0
the government also added property , bank accounts , jet skis , jewelry and watches to the list of assets subject to forfeiture , and estimated the value at at least $ 175 million			0
the defendants were first charged in a five - count indictment returned on jan. 5 and unsealed on jan. 19			0
the counts were : conspiracy to commit racketeering , conspiracy to commit copyright infringement , conspiracy to commit money laundering , and two counts of copyright infringement			1
five of the seven individuals indicted have been arrested , and at least $ 50 million in assets have been " restrained , " the @entity98 said in a news release			2
last month , @entity14 's fans turned the table on the feds			1
" @entity107 " collective @entity106 said it set its sights on the @entity109 @entity98 and apparently knocked the agency 's website offline			0
the @entity98 website glitches came soon after various @entity114 accounts associated with @entity106 took aim at the agency			0
@entity106 's favorite weapon for these attacks is a " distributed denial of service " ( @entity121 ) attack , which directs traffic to a website and overwhelms its servers , causing it to crash			0
the practice involves neither hacking nor any breach of security			0
it was @entity106 ' largest attack ever , according to an @entity106 representative , with 5,635 people using a networking tool called a " low orbit ion cannon			0
" a @entity136 is software tool that aims a flood of traffic at a targeted site			0
authorities said the " @entity143 " organization had generated more than $ 175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships			0
according to the indictment , @entity14 , which launched in 2005 , was once the 13th most - visited website on the @entity150 , serving as a hub for distribution of copyrighted television shows , images , computer software and video games			1
the site 's popular @entity14 subsidiary was widely known in tech circles for its broad selection of pirated content , including movies and episodes of hit tv shows			1
to shut @entity14 , federal authorities executed 20 search warrants in eight countries , seizing 18 domain names and $ 50 million worth of assets , including servers located in @entity171 , @entity172 , the @entity173 and @entity174			1
the individuals indicted are citizens of @entity59 , @entity176 , @entity177 and the @entity173			0
no @entity109 citizens were named			0
however , @entity14 has servers in @entity180 , @entity171 , and @entity172 , which prompted the @entity171 - based investigation .			2

new counts include copyright infringement , conspiracy to commit money laundering
@entity14 and related sites were shut last month
several of the sites ' alleged leaders were arrested
