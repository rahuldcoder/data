-- @entity1 does n't endorse presidential candidates -- he anoints political saviors			1
the actor , an avowed @entity4 , explains at the outset of an epic editorial on @entity7 that , " as a six - time undefeated middleweight world karate champion , i have a pretty good idea what makes a warrior			1
" in the nearly 1,400 words that follow , the fiery - spirited , flame - haired @entity13 winner lays out the " the trifecta of tyranny " that @entity17 , his new favorite @entity4 candidate is facing			1
namely , foe @entity19 's massive funding , the dreaded mainstream media ( @entity22 ) , and the " elite power mongering " forces within the @entity4 party itself			1
as you might expect , @entity1 's editorial is peppered with phrases that would make you think @entity29 is a ninja assassin under siege of a thousand enemies -- not a doughy former college professor			1
check out the top five soundbites below			2
@entity45 mention : " [ @entity46 ] chapped my hide [ with ] her clear audacity , arrogance and vindictiveness when she vehemently retorted like the wicked witch of the west : ' @entity42 my words : that man will not be elected ! ' " 5			0
" @entity17 spanked ( with great audience fanfare ) @entity50 's @entity49 at the @entity52 presidential debate ... [ and showed his ] ability to shut down the power grid of the @entity22			1
" while @entity19 decries that he is not a @entity57 insider , it is amazing to me that he gloats over the roughly 72 @entity57 elite who endorse him compared with @entity60			0
rather than a badge of honor , that 's a thorn of shame			2
" personally , i feel the entire future debate system should be derailed from the media 's control and played out exclusively on @entity68 with questions being fed entirely via the internet from citizens around the country			2
" [ in @entity1 's world , political debates should be argue - to - the - death cage matches in the style of " @entity78 " or " @entity79			1
" we must send someone in there who will turn over the establishment to resurrect the principles of our founding fathers and restore our republic			0
" one can not , in any way , underestimate the grisly enormity of this triple - headed monstrosity			0
it is a @entity91 of ginormous proportions			0
and let there be no doubt : only heaven and earth combining their forces will overcome this gargantuan foe			0
" [ @entity99 points for use of non-word " ginormous			0
" @entity1 does n't follow the rules of grammar -- he rules grammar			2
] considering the colorful language and battle - ready atmosphere permeating the @entity4 primaries , is there anyone better to throw his hat in the ring than @entity1 ? then again , given @entity1 's losing history of endorsements ( @entity114 in 2008 , @entity115 just last year ) , should he throw in the towel as a political kingmaker ? or would the world be a lesser place without his vivid verbal artistry ? also , now that @entity121 has endorsed @entity19 , are you ready for the iron - fisted ginger to face off against the big - mouthed duck ' do ? see the full article at @entity0			1
