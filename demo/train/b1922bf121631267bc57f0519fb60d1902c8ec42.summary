" the new accusations could further sully the reputation of @entity0 -- the man behind children 's programming like " @entity69 " and " @entity70 , " and whose eponymous no. 1 sitcom , " @entity72 , " cast him as a wisecracking , doting family man			1

he was laying next to me , and i slithered out of the bed ... i got myself together , i went downstairs , i got in a cab , and i went home			0
" asked by @entity12 's @entity28 what she think happened , @entity40 did n't hesitate			2
" there were bruise marks all over me , " she claimed			0
" i knew i was raped			0
" @entity0 challenged to meet accusers in court or set aside $ 100 million several other public accusers with @entity6 connection @entity25 said she 's been in therapy for years , trying to salve her emotional wounds			1
but it 's only now , about four decades later , that she 's decided to come public -- feeling compelled to act after hearing about @entity18			0
" that was it for me , " @entity25 said			2
" this man has to be held accountable			0
he 's a serial rapist			0
he 's been that way since the ' 60s			0
" @entity18 's story also has a @entity6 connection			2
in her lawsuit , filed in @entity143 , she claims that @entity0 met her and a 16 - year - old friend when he was filming a movie in the @entity148 city 's @entity146			1

she alleges he gave her pills at dinner to " cheer up , " after which she felt " stoned " as he took her to another place			0
there , @entity180 said @entity0 pushed himself near her mouth , before turning her around and raping her			2
