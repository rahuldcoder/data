@entity0 , @entity1 -- there is a place for people who enjoy soaking in the beautiful colors of fall and all the other amazing scenes of nature as they drive down the open highway			1
it 's called the right lane			1
if you 're sightseeing or rubbernecking in the left , get your butt over			1
why is that rule so freakin ' hard to follow ? as drivers , we do a lot of things that irritate each other			1
we signal but never turn			0
we turn but do n't signal			2
we forget who is supposed to go next at a four - way stop sign			0
but nothing comes close to the level of irritation that comes from being stuck behind someone doing 55 in a 65 in the far left lane			1
drive the speed you want , but why infringe on the rights of those in a hurry ? to me , that 's giving the rest of us on the road the finger in the most passive aggressive -- " who me ? " -- way possible			1
in fact , i would much rather have someone pull up beside me , roll down their window and flip me the bird as they go driving by than be trapped behind this vehicular anarchist			0
and you know they see you			0
they see all of us -- bobbing and weaving in their rearview mirror , trying to find a gap between the lanes big enough so we may be able to slip through and go on with our lives			0
but nooooooooo -- these offenders do n't feel obligated to go any faster and they refuse to move over to the right because in their sanctimonious minds , they 're going fast enough for all of us			1
that 's why they go through great lengths to ignore the high beams glaring in their eyes			0
and they do n't look over at you when you do eventually pass because they ca n't stop being prickly , not even for the three seconds it takes for us to look at them with our signature , highway glare that says : i. won			2
the thing is there are about 312 million people in the @entity78 and roughly 250 million registered vehicles			2
there will always be somebody somewhere driving faster ... it 's easier for everyone to just let them			0
besides , think of all the harm caused by slowpokes ? for example , how are cops going to hand out speeding tickets if no one can speed ? and what about all the coffee shops that are losing money from the customers who do n't have time to pull into the drive - thru before work because they 've been trapped behind " @entity98 " for five miles			1
essentially , slow drivers in the left lane are like job killers , and if elected president i would seek a constitutional amendment making lane hoarding illegal			1
and not just on the highway , but in every facet of life			0
the folks who like to walk side - by - side chatting on the track at the gym			0
you know who you are -- move it			2
the people who stand on an escalator in such a way as to take up the entire step should be assessed a property tax , especially in airports where they know everybody around them is trying to get somewhere else			2
really , is it so hard to stand to the right so those people who need to run up the stairs to make their flight , likely because they were trapped behind a slow driver in the left lane on the way to the airport , have a better chance of doing so ? if you 're visiting a new city , do n't stand in the middle of a busy sidewalk to look up or read a map			1
step off to the side so those who live there can get to where they are going			0
this is especially true for the too cute newlyweds who like take up 75 % of the sidewalk holding hands and staring into each other 's eyes			0
you do n't have to get a room , but you do need to get the hell out of the way			2
this week we celebrated the 7 billionth person being born , and the first thing i thought about was who is going to teach that person how to drive ? how to share the global common space that is slowly becoming more crowded , requiring us to be more aware of the needs of the people all around us ? because at the end of the day , that 's what the left lane is really all about			1
it 's not about how fast someone is going			0
it 's about having an agreed upon space where we let each other pass on by			2
a space we agree upon to let each other be			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			1

@entity173 : with 7 billion people , the world needs some rules
he says drivers who *dawdle* in the left lane should move over if they want to enjoy the view
if you 're moving slowly , make space on escalators , *staircases* for the speedy , he says
@entity173 : drive the speed you want , but do n't infringe on the rights of those in a hurry
