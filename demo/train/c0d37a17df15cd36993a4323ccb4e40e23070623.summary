to scuba divers and tourists , @entity1 's famous " @entity2 " underwater cave is a wonder , one of the " 10 most amazing places on @entity9 , " according to the @entity10			1
to scientists , it 's something more : evidence of the drought that is suspected to have led to the demise of the @entity17 civilization			1
new research reinforces that theory , @entity19 @entity9 scientist @entity18 told @entity22			0
the team drilled cores from the @entity2 sinkhole and a nearby lagoon			2
they found that the ratio of titanium to aluminum changed in the ninth and 10th centuries , a period when the @entity17 civilization in the @entity35 went into decline			2
more titanium means that heavier rains were affecting the region , since the runoff from the area 's volcanic rock is rich in the element			0
but from about a.d. 800 to 1000 , the ratio between the two elements was much smaller , indicating that there was much less rainfall			0

the @entity17 civilization , noted for its advances in astronomy and agriculture ( not to mention that calendar system that some believed prophesied world devastation on december 21 , 2012 ) , dominated the @entity35 in the first half of the first millennium @entity18 but by 900 , most of the civilization 's cities , located in present - day @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and southern @entity66 , had been abandoned			1
the question of why this happened has tantalized scientists and historians for decades			0
the drought theory is n't new , but the findings of @entity18 and his colleagues buttress other studies			0
in 2012 , samples from a 2,000 - year - old stalagmite also showed that drought had afflicted the region in the latter half of the first millennium @entity18 " the main finding was that a prolonged drought contributed to the collapse of classic @entity17 civilization , " environmental archaeologist @entity81 told @entity22 two years ago			1
@entity18 and his colleagues published their findings in @entity87 .			0
