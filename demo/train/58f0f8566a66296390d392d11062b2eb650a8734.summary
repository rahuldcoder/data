on december 10 last year a huge crowd rallied in @entity1			0
the people were fired up about alleged election fraud and fed up with prime minister @entity4			1
it was unprecedented in the country 's @entity7 history			2
it inspired predictions of a @entity13 winter to rival the @entity14			1
now three months , and several huge opposition rallies later , @entity4 looks certain to be elected president again			1
so what happened ? the big protests were ultimately triggered by claims that widespread cheating boosted the results for @entity4 's @entity22 in december 's parliamentary election -- claims the @entity24 denied			1
but there were other factors			0
@entity4 's announcement three months earlier that he would bump @entity28 and seek the presidency again for himself was a key moment			1
it was n't a total surprise			0
many had long suspected that @entity28 was just a seat warmer , helping the real boss work around the constitution and its limit of two consecutive presidential terms			0
but there was also hope @entity28 , who is considered a reformer , would find the fire in his belly to openly fight for the top job			0
it was a naive hope			0
the brazen admission of their private deal was like an open hand slap to the face -- a stinging reminder of who really has the power			0
suddenly @entity13 were confronted with the possibility of 12 more years of @entity4 's rule			1
many of the people most appalled by that idea have done well under @entity4			1
they 're educated , well traveled and economically comfortable			0
for @entity13 's new middle class the authoritarian stability of the @entity4 years has brought prosperity			1
but it 's no longer enough			2
now they want their vote to count and they want to use it to get rid of @entity4			1
" the most educated , the most responsible part of @entity13 society has come together to deliver a single message , " one first - time protester told me			1
" the current government has no right to represent @entity13 society			1
they do n't say what we want to say			0
they do n't take actions we want to take			0
" so says the urban middle class			0
but they do n't speak for the country			0
" it 's pure mathematics , " says @entity4 's spokesperson @entity80			1
" yes we have something like 70,000 people out there [ protesting ] on @entity88 but at the same time we have to keep in mind they are a minority			0
the majority of the population does not live here in @entity1			0
we have a huge country and if we look eastwards we 'll see lots and lots of big cities , small towns and rural populations that still support @entity4 pretty well			1
" there 's another important reason why @entity4 appears set to win			1
there 's no obvious alternative			2
@entity4 's closest electoral competitor is the @entity105 leader @entity104 -- a serial election loser			1
this would be his fourth defeat			0
two other candidates , right - wing table thumper @entity110 and left - leaning @entity112 have also run and lost spectacularly in the past			0
billionaire businessman @entity114 is the only fresh face in the pack			1
on paper , his manifesto of democratic and economic reforms should appeal to many of @entity1 's protesters			2
but he 's struggling to shake off his reputation for being too close to the regime			2
cynics call him a @entity24 project , a candidate designed to credibly attract the middle class vote without posing a genuine threat			0
@entity114 's repeated denials and slick campaign have not seen his polling move beyond single figure territory			1
the line - up of wannabe presidents is said to be another example of what 's known here as " managed democracy " where opposition candidates and parties are tolerated but only if they know their place			2
critics describe it as the illusion of democracy			0
while @entity4 's victory seems assured , we do n't know what it will look like			1
will there be more allegations of fraud ? will he win comfortably ? or will he get less than 50 % of the vote and be forced into a runoff with the second place candidate ? the last scenario appears increasingly unlikely but it 's what leaders of the opposition movement are desperately hoping for			1
it would be a clear sign @entity4 's support is eroding as well as an opportunity to weaken him further			1
but however he wins , the next @entity13 president can expect continued public dissent			2
" we want to see new elections , " says leading opposition figure @entity163			2
" @entity4 wo n't win on march 4			2
he will appoint himself as tsar			0
he 'll try to remain @entity13 president for the rest of his life			2
we need to fight and stop him from wrongly taking power			0
our goal is to keep pressure on @entity4			2
" in light of that intent , the answer to one question will sharply define @entity13 's immediate future : how would president @entity4 respond to further challenges to his authority ? @entity4 remains a sure bet for the presidential election			1
beyond that there 's only one other certainty			0
he 'll be leader of a country that has changed dramatically in the last three months .			0

@entity13 are confronted with the possibility of 12 more years of @entity4 's rule
@entity4 's closest electoral competitor is the @entity105 leader @entity104
@entity114 's slick campaign has not seen his polling move beyond single figure territory
a second round of voting looks increasingly unlikely
