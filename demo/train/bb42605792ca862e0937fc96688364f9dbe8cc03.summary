@entity0 -- the @entity2 admitted thursday that it sent more sets of military personnel remains to a @entity6 landfill than it originally acknowledged			2
backtracking on initial information about how it handled the remains of @entity10 service members killed in @entity11 and @entity12 , the @entity2 now says the cremated body parts of hundreds of the fallen were burned and dumped in the landfill			1
earlier , the @entity2 said only a small number of body parts had been buried in a commercial landfill and claimed it would be impossible to make a final determination of how many remains were disposed of in that manner			1
the @entity20 broke the story thursday , and the @entity2 now confirms that body fragments linked to at least 274 fallen military personnel sent to the @entity24 were cremated , incinerated and buried with medical waste			1
that procedure was in place between november 2003 and may 1 , 2008			0
the @entity2 also said that 1,762 body parts were never identified and also were disposed of , first by cremation , then by further incineration and then buried in a landfill			1
congressman @entity32 , @entity33 , thursday accused the @entity34 of what he called " willful blindness " in not acting faster to identify and correct the problems and fully report them			1
" for years , this has been handled unceremoniously and insensitively and , i would say , dishonorably , " @entity32 said in a telephone interview			0
he said he had been asking the @entity34 for months about information about @entity24 , on behalf of a constituent whose husband was killed five years ago			1
" they do n't get it			0
they do n't understand the degree of dishonor involved in all of this , " @entity32 said			0
last month , the @entity34 told the congressman that exact numbers could not be determined			1
" without individual case - by - case review , the exact number of service - directed disposition of subsequent remains can not be determined , " said a fact sheet sent to @entity32 in november			1
" it would require a massive effort and time to recall records and research individually			0
" when bodies are not intact -- for instance , in the aftermath of a crash or explosion -- a body may be released to the family before some parts have been identified by the @entity67 at @entity24 in @entity68			1
families can elect to be notified when parts are identified or leave it up to the military to dispose of them appropriately			2
since the policy was changed in 2008 , the unclaimed body parts are buried at sea			1
an earlier report found instances of mismanagement and inadequate accounting at @entity24 , noting that some body parts were missing from the mortuary and in one case an arm was sawed off so a body would fit in a casket			1
an independent group of experts is now investigating what happened at the mortuary and defense secretary @entity89 has ordered the @entity2 to look at how mortuary employees there were disciplined			2
two civilians were transferred to other jobs and a military officer received a career - ending letter of reprimand			0
@entity32 pointed to how the @entity10 spends millions each year searching for the remains of service members missing in action from previous wars , for instance in @entity102			1
" that makes us proud to be an @entity10 , that we would do that , " @entity32 said			0
" it is a level of response that honors our soldiers			0
" the mistakes at @entity24 send a different message , @entity32 said			1
" it sends shudders to think that we engage in this kind of desecration			0
" but at the @entity34 , aides to defense secretary @entity89 said @entity89 is satisfied with how the @entity2 responded in regard to the landfill policy and new information about how many of the @entity10 fallen were involved			1
" i think the secretary is comfortable with the way the @entity2 has handled this , " said @entity34 spokesman capt. @entity121			2
and @entity121 strongly pushed back against criticism by rep. @entity32			0
" i do n't think there is another federal agency in this town , i do n't think there is another institution in this country , " that understands more about how to properly treat the remains of fallen troops , said @entity121 , tapping the briefing room table for emphasis			2
@entity121 said the @entity2 is establishing a call center ( 1 - 855 - 637 - 2583 or e-mail dover.pm@pentagon.af.mil ) so families of the fallen can seek information			0
until now , families may not have been informed if part of a loved ones remains had been burned and discarded with medical waste			1
@entity34 press secretary @entity145 said @entity89 was aware of the new reports			2
" the secretary supports the recent @entity2 investigation and he wants to see all of this move forward in a way that allows the @entity2 to do its work and to avoid the kinds of lapses we did witness , and those lapses were regrettable , " @entity145 said			0
later thursday the @entity2 said it was ready to apologize to any family that objected to the disposition of a loved one 's remains			2
" we regret any additional grief to the families past practices may have caused , " said @entity2 lt. gen. @entity161 , deputy @entity2 chief of staff			0
" we are prepared to apologize			0
it causes great pain to know we have brought suffering to a family , " @entity161 said			0
@entity161 said only nine people have contacted a hotline seeking information about body fragments that may have been cremated , then incinerated and finally dumped with medical waste in a landfill prior to 2008			1
@entity161 did not directly say that that now - abandoned policy was disrespectful			0
" it is certainly not the way we would have done it , looking back , " @entity161 said			0
" that 's why in 2008 when we saw that practice , we changed that practice			0
" he said that under current rules , body parts such as small fragments of soft tissue or bone are collected for " retirement at sea , " a respectful transfer of the remains to the ocean from a @entity194 ship			1
so far since 2008 , he said , only 14 urns containing body fragments have been disposed of at sea .			2
