in the future , women may be able to buy birth control pills alongside ibuprofen and cough drops if the recommendation of the @entity6 is adopted			1
the group is recommending that oral contraceptives be sold over the counter without a prescription in an effort to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in the @entity14			1
approximately 50 % of all pregnancies are unplanned , a rate that has n't changed much in the past 20 years , according to the @entity17 , a nonprofit organization dedicated to reproductive health research			1
women in their 20s are most at risk			2
" access and cost issues are common reasons why women either do not use contraception use or have gaps in use , " according to the @entity6			1
many developed countries still require a prescription for oral contraceptives , including @entity32 and most of @entity33 , but many other countries sell the pill without a prescription even formally or informally			1
the movement to push birth control over the counter is nothing new , says dr. @entity41 , who volunteers as vice chairman for the @entity43 on @entity44			2
in the early 1990s , a paper in the @entity46 argued that oral contraceptives should be available without a prescription			1
what 's different now , @entity41 says , is that a large body of evidence documents the safety and effectiveness of the pill , as well as research showing that women are interested in receiving it over the counter			1
free contraception may prevent abortions " i want it between the condoms and pregnancy test kits , " said @entity61 , president and ceo of the @entity63 , a group advocating for reproductive freedom			1
" i want it there so it 's giving the message : if you 're sexually active , use protection			0
" as with any drug , there are risks associated with oral contraceptives			1
the @entity6 acknowledges that the pill can increase a patient 's risk of blood clots and stroke , especially if she is obese or smokes			0
and selling the medication over the counter would reduce the chance that a woman would be screened by a doctor			2
but the group also says studies have shown that women may be able to self - screen for these conditions using a simple questionnaire			1
the physicians group argues that the risks must be put in context with the risk of blood clots or stroke with an unintended pregnancy			1
" the comparison is n't taking the pill or not taking the pill , " @entity61 said			0
" it 's taking the pill or not taking the pill and risking becoming pregnant			0
" @entity41 says he 's most concerned about the costs that may be associated with over-the - counter oral contraceptives			1
although the @entity108 requires coverage of birth control prescriptions , insurance companies may not cover over-the - counter medications			2
if the product is n't sold at an accessible price for consumers , @entity41 said , " it 's going to replace a prescription barrier with a cost barrier			1
" the @entity6 says similar incidents show that moving birth control over the counter will probably increase use			2
when nicotine patches and gum went on sale over the counter , attempts to quit smoking using those products nearly doubled , statistics from the @entity130 show			2
and sales of emergency contraception doubled in the year after @entity135 one step " morning - after pill " went over the counter , according to the advocacy group @entity137			1
@entity139 schools offer morning - after pill to students another benefit to offering birth control without a prescription is that it may provide greater access to populations that otherwise would not take advantage of these medications			2
" over-the - counter access will greatly reduce the systemic barriers , like poverty , immigration status and language , that currently prevent @entity155 from regularly accessing birth control and results in higher rates of unintended pregnancy , " the @entity148 said in a statement			1
the @entity6 hopes its recommendation will motivate a pharmaceutical company to take the next step , @entity41 said			0
a company with a prescription medication patent would have to submit an application to the @entity166 to begin the over-the - counter approval process			2
in order to do that , the company needs to have research on its birth control product 's safety as an over-the - counter medication			0
these studies would have to prove to the @entity166 that the right people will choose to take the medication -- meaning otherwise healthy women who want to avoid pregnancy -- rather than the people who should n't purchase it -- meaning those at high risk of blood clots or stroke			0
in a statement , the @entity166 said it is willing to meet with any pharmaceutical company that may want to switch its product to over-the - counter status			0
in @entity189 , a 14 - year fight for birth control a few other obstacles stand in the way of the @entity43 ' recommendation becoming reality			0
the battle to make emergency contraception available without a prescription was long and full of political pitfalls , @entity61 said			0
the first application to allow @entity135 to be sold over the counter was denied ; after about three years of debate , permission was given only for women over the age of 17			1
" any company is looking at the way the @entity166 handled emergency contraception and saying , ' i 'm not taking that bait , ' " @entity61 said			0
even if a company were to step forward , this would be " uncharted territory " for the @entity166 , @entity41 notes			0
the agency has never approved a chronic over-the - counter medication -- one that 's taken daily for an unlimited amount of time			0
( although consumers sometimes take aspirin or antacids daily , they are not labeled for that kind of use			0
) there will also undoubtedly be arguments against the recommendation , whether they stem from fears over encouraging risky behavior , concerns about about patient adherence or religious beliefs			0
still , @entity41 said , consumers could see birth control medications sold over the counter in less than five years			1
" it is a pretty bold move on the part of @entity6 , " he said			0
" i really respect that the organization decided to make this statement after reviewing all the evidence			0
it 's not very common where you hear a physician organization say , ' we think there should be a change so that our patients do n't have to see us anymore			0
