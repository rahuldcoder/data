if only this was just a @entity2 trick			0
visitors trying to log on to the @entity5 website early thursday morning saw the same stubborn phrase that has roiled users for weeks : " the system is down at the moment			1
" it 's been almost a full month since the @entity12 website launched , riddled with technical problems despite a series of advance warning signs			2
and despite a chorus of apologies out of @entity19 , it may be another month before everything 's running smoothly			0
vice president @entity21 became the highest - ranking administration official to apologize wednesday for the botched rollout			2
" we assumed that it was up and ready to run , " he told @entity25 's sister network @entity24			2
" but the good news is although it 's not -- and we apologize for that -- we are confident by the end of november it 'll be , and there 'll still be plenty of time for people to register and get online			2
" that came after @entity35 secretary @entity34 apologized for the " miserably frustrating " problems with the website during a 3 1/2 - hour congressional grilling			1
the former @entity40 governor promised a " vast majority " of consumers will be able to shop online for health insurance under @entity5 with greater ease by the end of november			1
analysis : @entity34 deals with a difficult day 5 things we learned from @entity34 hearing " in these early weeks , access to @entity12 has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many @entity52 , including many who have waited years , in some cases their entire lives , for the security of health insurance , " @entity34 said			1
to the frustrated users who have had problems , she said : " you deserve better			0
i 'm accountable to you for fixing these problems			0
" she said she made a mistake when she told president @entity63 that @entity12 was " ready to go " for its october 1 launch			1
" clearly , i was wrong			0
we were wrong , " she said			0
" we knew that in any big , new , complicated system there would be problems			0
no one ever imagined the volume of issues and problems that we have had and we must fix it			0
" @entity63 could n't log on @entity21 said he did n't even bother logging on to the @entity5 site			1
" actually , the president tried to get online , and my daughter tried to get online , " he said			0
" i did not , because it was clear that i was not getting online			2
" @entity63 himself acknowledged that too many people " have gotten stuck , and i am not happy about it			2
" " there 's no excuse for it , " the president said			0
" and i take full responsibility for making sure it gets fixed asap			1
" glass half full ? @entity34 said the sweeping health care program has delivered on its central promise to provide affordable health care coverage			1
thousands have been able to access the website to look at new health coverage options that will give them security of knowing they wo n't go bankrupt if they get sick , she said			2
who is @entity34 ? she echoed the overall administration stance -- that a team of experts is scrambling to fix the website 's errors			1
@entity103 have called for @entity34 to be fired for the @entity5 problems , but a @entity106 spokesman said wednesday that @entity63 has " complete confidence " in her			1
" she took responsibility for many of the problems that are evident with the ( @entity5 ) website , but she also deserves credit for the other aspects of the @entity5 implementation that have gone well , " spokesman @entity108 told reporters			1
in fact , @entity63 tried to turn the tables on @entity103 opponents of his signature health care reforms , challenging them to come up with helpful ideas instead of undermining the federal law			2
" anyone defending the remnants of the old , broken system -- as if it was working for people -- anybody who thinks we should n't finish the job of making the health care system work for everybody ... those folks should have to explain themselves , " he said			1
according to the @entity136 website , 15.4 million people had individual health care coverage in 2011 , representing about 5 % of the population			0
the vast majority of @entity52 have coverage through their employer , @entity141 , @entity142 or other public providers and will not be affected by changes involving individual coverage			0
@entity106 spokesman @entity146 said tuesday that " a significant portion " of the 5 % of people with individual coverage will end up paying less for better policies when they shop around in the new exchanges			0
sufficient preparation ? some of the criticism of the website 's launch has to do with what @entity63 and other officials knew and when they knew it			1
@entity25 has learned the administration received stark warnings a month before the launch that the @entity5 site was not ready to go live , according to a confidential report			1
the caution , from the main contractor @entity166 , warned of risks and issues for @entity12 , even as company executives were testifying publicly the project was on track			0
administration was warned before site launch @entity34 told the @entity174 the outside contractors that built the website never recommended delaying this month 's launch			1
but she conceded that " we did not adequately do end - to - end testing			0
" the contracts with the private companies working on the @entity5 website -- which amount to $ 174 million so far , with more bills due well into 2014 -- do not have " built - in penalties " allowing her department to charge them for disappointing or faulty work , @entity34 said			1
but the @entity34 said the agency will not pay for incomplete work			2
security questions @entity103 rep. @entity191 of @entity192 , who chairs the @entity193 , accused @entity34 of putting the private information of @entity52 at risk by failing to properly test security measures on the website			1
" this is a completely unacceptable level of security , " he said			0
" you know it 's not secure			0
" @entity34 responded that testing occurs regularly , and she told @entity191 she would get back to him on whether any end - to - end security test of the entire system has ever occurred			1
@entity191 responded that he knows there have been no such comprehensive security tests			0
@entity207 warned of high security risk at health care website an internal government memo obtained by @entity25 on wednesday and written days before the website launched warned of a " high " security risk because of a lack of testing			0
" due to system readiness issues , the ( security control assessment ) was only partly completed , " said the @entity141 memo			0
" this constitutes a risk that must be accepted and mitigated to support the @entity222 1 operations			0
" @entity34 told @entity25 last week that @entity63 did n't know of the problems with the site -- even though insurance companies had complained and the site crashed during a pre-launch test run -- until after it went live			1
a senior administration official said @entity63 now gets a " nightly readout " with the latest @entity5 statistics and an update of the website 's status			1
