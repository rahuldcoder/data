-- @entity2 and covered in dirt and sweat , 14 - year - old @entity1 pulls weeds from orderly rows of sugar cane			0
wearing an oversized red cap to protect him from the scorching @entity10 sun , @entity1 is doing work that should be reserved for men , not children			1
earning 150 pesos ( $ 3.50 ) for a seven - hour day , @entity1 has been a child laborer in the @entity10 region of @entity15 since he was seven years old			1
he says he does it to help his parents , but he is just one of many children who are part of an illegal economic system of child labor			1
the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) estimates 2.4 million child workers are in the @entity10			2
many of them , according to the @entity22 , are in rural areas working in fields and mines			2
the organization estimates 60 % work in hazardous conditions			2
alongside @entity1 is 13 - year - old @entity32 , who dropped out of school when he was in the first grade			0
back then , he explained , his family did n't have enough money to eat			0
@entity32 says he wants to learn to read and write but because he is needed in the fields he has no time to go to school			0
when the boys turn 15 or 16 , they 'll move on to the more hazardous job of cutting sugar cane			0
that 's currently the job of 16 - year - old @entity44 , who has n't been to school since he was a young child , sentencing him to a future in the fields			2
the use of child laborers in the sugar fields of @entity15 is so common that landowner @entity50 shrugs it off as a way of life			1
" the parents beg us to include their children to work , " she said			2
much of the sugar produced in the fields here ends up in coffee shops , on kitchen tables and on store shelves across the world			0
" we do not deny that child labor exists in our industry , " said @entity64 , the president and coo of the @entity66			1
" it 's a practice among families who are paid piecemeal for their work			2
they like to employ their children because there 's more income for the families			0
" @entity64 said that paying workers more so they 're not tempted to use their children has not worked in the past			0
she cites the strong cultural ties of families working together in the fields as one of the main problems			1
" if you do n't change their attitude and their values , then you do n't change their way of life			0
there 's a long - term solution and it 's really education			0
we feel children should want to go to school , they should be kept in school , and aware of the rights of the children , the rights of the child to go to school and the right of the child to play , " she said			0
the child labor problem is so overt and widespread in this region that @entity64 says the @entity66 and the @entity107 are paying to build a four - room high school that is set to open later this month			1
the @entity109 is one of the largest buyers of sugar in the world and the sugar factories fed by the fields of @entity15 call @entity107 one of their main customers			1
in a statement to @entity0 , @entity107 said it " does not support , encourage or endorse any form of child labor in our operations throughout our global bottling system or in our supplier network			1
" the company says it conducts continuous assessments of its operations to ensure strong policies and practices are in place to help avoid child labor			1
in september 2010 , the @entity107 says it joined a coalition of the local government , the @entity22 and private industry to remove children from sugarcane fields with the hope of eradicating child labor in the @entity141 region			1
the @entity10 government has also pledged to reduce child labor by 75 % by 2015			1
by then @entity1 will be 17 - years - old			0
it 's more likely that he will have graduated to cutting sugar cane than high school .			0

child labor is common practice is @entity10 region of @entity15
children as young as seven can work each day in sugar fields
@entity10 government plans to reduce child labor by 75 % by 2015
some *suggest* cultural ties to families working together make it harder to eradicate
