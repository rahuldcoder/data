-- a 29 - year - old @entity2 citizen and @entity4 veteran sits in a bare apartment in a poor part of the @entity8 capital , @entity9			1
he wants to come home , but he ca n't			1
he thinks it 's because he 's on the federal government 's " no - fly list			1
" @entity14 is one of an unknown number of @entity2 stranded overseas			1
they ca n't fly home , but no one will tell them why			1
in @entity14 's case , he went to the airport in @entity9 on march 14 to board a plane for @entity23 , @entity24			1
" i had a job offered to me and one of the requirements to secure the job was that i had to take a medical exam			2
it was scheduled for march 16 in the @entity2 , " @entity14 said			1
when he arrived at the gate , however , an airline official denied him a boarding pass			2
he was instructed to contact the @entity34 in @entity9			0
" they told me i could n't fly with the airline , with any airline , " he said			1
they did n't give me a reason why			2
i 've been stuck in @entity8 without any explanation			1
" @entity14 , a resident of @entity42 , believes he has been placed on the federal no - fly list			1
the list is maintained by the @entity45 and indicates who might be a risk to civil aviation , specifically those suspected of being domestic or international terrorists			2
this list is disseminated among various government agencies like the @entity53 , for use in screening passengers			2
" my plan was to go do my medical screening in the @entity2 , spend time with my family , secure my job and come back to @entity8 to get my wife , " @entity14 said			1
the company retracted my offer and i lost the job			0
" he flew to @entity8 in march from @entity66 to marry his then - fiance and said he encountered no problems			1
he had been living in @entity66 since 2006 working for @entity69 , the same company that offered him the new position as a heavy mobile equipment mechanic in @entity72			0
@entity14 converted to @entity73 in 2008 and with others created a website about the religion 's teachings			1
nothing on the site suggests it condones violence , and in a statement to @entity0 , @entity14 said : " people have a lot of misconceptions about @entity73 , but the truth is that @entity73 is a religion of peace			1
" with a daughter living in @entity91 , his new wife pregnant with his second child and a fast - evaporating bank account , @entity14 says he is running out of options			1
" my wife 's family has given a little bit of help , but if i did n't have any money saved up , i 'd be homeless right now , " he said			0
he is currently living in @entity100 , @entity8			1
" it 's really simple			0
i 've got a bed and a little table			0
... i do n't even have a refrigerator in my home , " he said			2
" i 've just been surviving			0
" unable to get answers , on june 30 @entity107 and nine others who are either citizens or legal residents of the @entity2 filed a lawsuit , aided by the @entity111 , against attorney general @entity112 , fbi director @entity113 and @entity114 , head of the @entity115			1
" our clients have done nothing wrong , " said @entity116 , a staff attorney with the @entity111 who is helping to represent @entity107 and the others			0
" when [ the government ] puts them on a list that impacts their lives , their ability to see family , to get jobs , the government has to give them a chance to stand up for themselves			2
" @entity14 has tried other ways to get home			1
in may he planned to fly from @entity8 to @entity133 and then cross the @entity2 - @entity133 border by land			1
but he was greeted at the gate in @entity137 by government agents			0
they detained him and questioned him about his recent conversion to @entity73			1
fifteen hours later , he says , he was put on a plane back to @entity9			0
@entity14 's mother , @entity142 , who lives in @entity143 , @entity42 , says that she speaks with her son almost every day			1
" he 's called me a couple of times where i feel the pain , i feel the fear and i ca n't do a thing , " @entity145 said			0
" it 's the worst feeling for a parent			0
i have gone out of my way to find out why and no one can tell me			0
he calls and there is nothing else i can do			2
" finding out whether you are on the no - fly list is a matter of trial and error , and sometimes begins with a humiliating and unexpected moment at an airport check - in desk			1
the list is not made public			2
the @entity165 has created the @entity166 , known as @entity166 , so that people who have been prevented from flying can request a review of their status			0
" there are two problems with this process , " said @entity116 , the @entity111 attorney			0
" first , the @entity165 does n't control who is on the list , the @entity45 does			2
so this whole program is controlled by an agency that has no authority			0
secondly , the response sent by the government is hardly satisfactory			0
" the determination of redress can be viewed via a " status page " on the @entity165 's website			0
the update indicates whether an individual 's case is in process , has been completed or requires more information			0
the website also says that " security procedures and legal concerns mandate that we can neither confirm nor deny any information about you that may be within federal watch lists			0
" so the individual must try to take another flight to see if they have been removed from the list			2
an additional guideline from the trip program articulates that anyone who files for redress will be asked for additional documentation within 30 days			0
@entity14 sent in his redress form on march 26			1
he says he has yet to hear anything			0
the @entity45 said that it is unable to comment on whether @entity107 is on the no - fly list			1
but in a written statement , the bureau said that " several recent high - profile attempted terror plots ... remind us of the need to remain vigilant and thoroughly investigate every lead to fend off any potential threats to the @entity2 " @entity53 spokeswoman @entity217 said she is unable to comment on the case because of the ongoing litigation with the @entity111			1
one man who was caught up in the same dilemma but eventually was allowed to return home is @entity223 , who lives in @entity224			1
he had been studying @entity225 in @entity226 with his brother			0
on the way home he was prevented from boarding a plane in @entity230			2
he was stuck in the @entity232 capital for six weeks , with little money			0
@entity223 was finally permitted to leave @entity232 on a waiver and temporary passport			0
while in @entity230 , @entity223 was " hanging out in a cheap hotel watching tv and periodically going to fast food restaurants in the area , " said @entity236 , national communications director for the @entity237			0
@entity237 helped @entity223 to return home			2
according to @entity236 , @entity223 's permanent passport was revoked and can only be regained if he repays a loan to the @entity2 embassy that helped cover his food and hotel costs			1
the @entity248 said the @entity2 @entity34 in @entity230 offers assistance to anyone who asks but would not disclose details about the reported loan			1
despite his experiences , @entity223 supports the " no - fly list			1
" " if this is something that 's going to help my country and stop bad people from doing what they do , i 'm happy for it , " @entity223 said			0
for his part , @entity107 continues to look for creative ways to travel home			2
he is currently looking into traveling by boat			0
he says the earliest he would be able to do so would be in october aboard a cargo ship headed for @entity24			0
" what 's happening to people like @entity269 , these are @entity2 citizens who have a right to come back to the country in which they are citizens , " said @entity116			1
" right now , what this is , it is involuntary exile			0
" and exile brings its own risks			0
earlier this month , @entity14 's authorization to stay in @entity8 expired and he fears arrest if he is unable to have it renewed			1
" it 's really scary because i do n't know what 's going to happen to me , to my family , " he said			0
" there should n't be any reason for this			2
no one has given me any reason			2

@entity14 has not been allowed to fly home from @entity8
he says he has been given no reason , but thinks he is on the @entity2 no - fly list
in 2008 he converted to @entity73 , which he calls " a religion of peace "
he and nine others have filed a lawsuit against three @entity2 officials
