-- @entity1 , the tiny nation bordering @entity2 and @entity3 , was already a fan favorite at the @entity5 given its massive underdog tag			1
but the national team likely gained even more supporters after players turned down a " large amount of money " to throw a match against the @entity11 at the tournament			0
two of the players , @entity16 and @entity17 , told @entity19 officials about the incident and after an investigation was launched , it led to " positive identification of the individual attempting the bribery , " the governing body said in a statement			1
" we want to thank @entity16 and @entity17 and recognize them for their bravery and commitment to preserving the integrity of our game , " @entity19 said			2
according to the website of a television station in @entity1 , the man offering the money first met team members in @entity3 and attempted to befriend them			1
he then called them in @entity38 , @entity39 and met players at a mall near the team hotel two days before the game against the @entity5 host			1
" he started talking that we do n't really stand a chance to beat the @entity11 so he wanted us to promise him that we would lose the game and that he would give us a large amount of money to change our lives in @entity1 and to help our families , " @entity17 was quoted as saying by the website , www.7newsbelize.com			1
even though the majority of @entity1 's players are part - timers and the team needed to hold fundraisers to help cover costs , the players declined the offer			1
" he saw that my features changed and he saw that we were n't into it so he got frightened and took out a large amount of money to bribe us , a lot of hundred and fifty dollar bills and threw it at us on the table and told us to keep it and to not say anything , " @entity17 , a defender , said			2
" like i told him , ' we ca n't take that money , ' because at the end of the day our country is behind us and we just made history for these big games so we ca n't just sell out our country for a little bit of money			0
" @entity1 , 130th in the @entity82 rankings , would go on to lose 6 - 1 to the @entity11 in @entity38 in its tournament debut wednesday			1
" we are @entity1 and that is what we 're doing out here -- to represent our country and me , @entity16 , and being loyal to my country , " said @entity16 , the backup keeper			2
" that ( is ) bigger than any amount of money that they can ever give me and that is why i stood firm			0
" thank @entity93 we had that strength to deny this man because he was really into giving us a large amount of money			0
" although the actions of the @entity1 internationals will be fully applauded , the approach raises concerns about the seemingly easy access to players			1
in february , @entity104 deemed more than 600 games across the globe suspicious as the sport 's underbelly -- of match fixing -- was exposed			0
" the fight against match manipulation is a top priority for @entity19 , " @entity19 said			0
" in alignment with @entity82 guidelines and with the help of outside entities such as @entity117 , we have taken all necessary measures to ensure the legitimacy of each game played throughout the @entity121			0
" we are precluded from commenting any further on this matter , due to the ongoing nature of the investigation			0
" @entity82 did n't return an email from @entity0 seeking comment			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , faces @entity127 on saturday .			2

@entity1 internationals were offered cash in exchange for throwing @entity5 game
they refused and told officials , who subsequently identified the individual in *question*
@entity1 , ranked 130th in the world , is playing at the @entity5 for the first time
