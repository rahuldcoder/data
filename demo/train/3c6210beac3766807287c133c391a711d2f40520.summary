@entity0 , @entity1 -- rescue workers -- who had suspended their underwater search of the @entity7 after the cruise ship moved , making it too risky for divers to operate -- resumed searching friday night on the upper part of the ship , the @entity4 coast guard said			1
rescue workers previously suspended their search when sensors on board the vessel measured movement , @entity17 , of the @entity19 general command , told @entity2			1
" when this happens all rescue forces have to leave the ship , ( so as ) not to put their lives in danger , " he said			1
underwater searches will not resume until saturday , the @entity4 coast guard said			1
the authorities are now assessing their options			0
one possibility being considered is an attempt to anchor the vessel to the rocks off @entity0 using chains			1
but , warned @entity17 , " it 's very difficult			1
the @entity7 weighs 110,000 tons and it 's like a 300 meter - high skyscraper in an horizontal position			1
" @entity4 authorities are considering when to call off the search for survivors and start the recovery operation , which would mean salvage workers can start emptying the ship 's huge fuel tanks			1
@entity19 captain @entity46 said that preparation for the fuel removal operation is underway , though it has not started yet			1
a vessel with a huge tank still needs to come to the island to store the fuel			2
this will happen in the coming days , he said			0
at least 11 people are known to have died in the disaster , and 21 are still missing , according to the @entity56			0
a week after the ship ran aground off the @entity60 coast , it appeared increasingly unlikely that any survivors will still be found aboard the ship			2
on friday , more relatives of the missing passengers arrived on the island			2
" it 's terrible , we spend all day with relatives of those that have someone still missing and of those that have been identified , " @entity0 vice mayor @entity66 said			1
a little bar located on the harbor was drawing a bit of business selling hot drinks and coffee			0
a private boat carrying @entity81 , @entity4 and @entity83 relatives of the dead and missing , chartered by the @entity4 authorities , sailed from @entity86 on the mainland friday lunchtime , to @entity0			1
cook : captain ordered dinner after crash a spokesman for the mayor of @entity0 said the families had scattered flowers on the water by the wreck site			1
also on the boat was @entity99 , the mother of a missing 5 - year - old @entity4 girl , @entity100			1
the girl 's father , @entity99 's ex-husband , @entity101 , is also unaccounted for			2
" @entity100 was very happy and excited for this trip , " said @entity103 , lawyer for @entity99			2
" she packed all her nicest clothes last thursday			0
we know from other passengers that she was wearing a life vest but her father no. they are not experienced swimmers			0
@entity99 tried to reach the father 's mobile many times that night , but nobody answered			2
" eight of the dead have so far been named -- four @entity81 passengers , a @entity118 passenger , and @entity4 and one crew member each from @entity120 and @entity83			1
criticism from both @entity122 and the authorities has focused so far on capt. @entity124 , who is under house arrest and facing possible charges of manslaughter , shipwreck and abandoning ship			2
his lawyer , @entity132 , spoke to @entity134 on friday , urging people to reserve judgment on the captain until they have all the facts			1
" obviously , before we can talk about responsibilities , we need to make sure that there is a series of facts that are corroborated			0
until now we only have one fact : the fact that the ship @entity7 hit a rock			2
what were the causes of the collision : a wrong maneuver ? a missing sign on the sea maps ? high speed ? a sudden change of route ? improvised route ? i am not able to determine this , " @entity132 told the @entity4 news channel			1
" it will be the technical examinations that will in their entirety clarify the dynamic of the events , " @entity132 reportedly said			0
further doubt was cast on @entity167 's leadership late thursday when a cook from the ship told a @entity171 television station that the captain ordered dinner for himself and a woman at about 10:30 p.m. , less than an hour after the collision			1
" we wondered what was going on , " cook @entity176 told @entity177			0
" at that time , we really felt something was wrong			0
... the stuff in the kitchen was falling off shelves and we realized how grave the situation was			0
" however , a @entity186 woman @entity124 , 25 , who also works for the @entity122 cruise line but said she was on the @entity7 as a passenger , defended the captain in a tv interview			2
" i 've heard in @entity192 media that the captain left the ship first , or among the first			1
but this is not true , " she said			0
" i 'm a witness -- i do n't know if i 'm invited to testify in the court or not , but as a witness i can say that i left the deck at 11:50 p.m. following an order from the captain who told me to go to the third deck to get into a lifeboat that could take more people			2
" @entity203 said she had gone to the deck to help translate the captain 's orders after hearing a coded announcement that raised the alarm for crew members			1
coast guard records published thursday by an @entity4 newspaper added to the pressure on @entity167 and his officers , suggesting authorities first became aware of the crash from a friend of the mother of a passenger about 15 minutes after the ship hit rocks			1
the @entity19 identified the ship in trouble and contacted it , asking if there were problems on board , at 10:14 p.m. -- more than half an hour after the 9:41 p.m. collision -- according to a @entity19 log published in the newspaper @entity226			2
the ship responded that it was experiencing a " black out , " according to the log and said the crew believed it could solve the problem in a short time			2
the log does not indicate which crew member was speaking			0
what appears to be the audio of that first radio call between the @entity7 and the @entity19 was broadcast on @entity4 media thursday			1
a @entity19 official is heard to ask : " what kind of a problem is it ? just something with the generator ? the police of @entity241 have received a phone call from the relatives of a sailor who said that during the dinner everything was falling on his head			0
" the unidentified crew member responds : " we have a black out and we are checking the conditions on board			0
" " the passengers say they have been told to put on the life vests , is this correct ? " the @entity19 then asks , to which the crew member repeats the same answer , before promising to keep the @entity19 updated			0
in @entity167 's hometown of @entity258 , residents were standing by the cruise ship captain			1
a spray - painted sheet left hanging outside the home where @entity167 is under house arrest says , " captain , do n't give up			0
" " it looks like the only one responsible is the captain			0
that 's what everyone on the outside think , " mayor @entity266 said			0
" but in this village , people know he can not be responsible for everything			0
it 's not like journalists want to portray it			0
" the decision to give up the search for survivors is expected to come by the weekend , when the weather is forecast to deteriorate			0
declaring the operation to be recovery rather than rescue would allow salvage experts to start pumping fuel out of the ship , potentially averting an environmental catastrophe			0
the ship was carrying about 2,300 tons of fuel when it hit rocks			0
prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers , causing the shipwreck , according to legal papers			1
judge @entity296 's initial ruling found @entity167 changed the ship 's course , steering too close to shore and causing the ship to hit a rock			1
@entity122 chairman @entity301 earlier this week placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain , saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes			1
there were roughly 4,200 people on the @entity7 when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members , the vast majority of whom made it off the ship safely			0
@entity2 's @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 and journalist @entity316 contributed to this report .			0
