-- just in case you had any lingering illusions that politics deals with substantial issues , here 's the issue that last week filled our media chatter : which is worse - to put a dog on the roof of a fast - moving car or to eat dog - meat as food ? as you probably know , the @entity17 campaign has been battered for months by a story about a family vacation in the 1980s			1
@entity17 , driving his family of five boys to summer vacation in @entity23 , had improvised a dog cage atop the family car			1
he wrapped the dog cage in plexiglass to form a windbreak			2
the idea did not work			2
the dog fouled its cage and later ran away			2
one of @entity17 's sons laughingly repeated the story to a reporter years later , and ever since it has become @entity35 in the case against @entity17			1
weary of this ridiculous line of attack , somebody on the @entity17 campaign dug out an extract from @entity42 's memoir , " @entity43 " , published in 1995			1
in that book , @entity42 recalls that his @entity46 stepfather introduced him as a boy to the local cuisine , which included dog , snake and grasshoppers			1
this fact , in print for almost two decades , was dusted off last week as a new revelation in the @entity56 website			0
talk radio and conservative blogs seized on the theme			0
twitter memes proliferated : # @entity61 , # @entity62 , etc. the line between journalism and gossip is always thin and poorly marked			0
when journalists cross that line , as they so often do , they invoke " larger meanings " exposed by the titillating story of the moment			0
thus , the " larger meaning " supposedly exposed by the dog - on - the - roof story : @entity17 is a heartless technocrat , ready to conduct brutal experiments on unsuspecting people or beasts and who only laughs if the experiment does not go well for the subject / victim			1
and thus too the " larger meaning " seen by partisans inside the @entity42 - eats - dog story : @entity42 is an alien , raised in alienation from basic @entity86 values , and protected by a complicit news media that refuses to report embarrassing facts about him - like dog - eating			1
as the scare quotes above suggest , i do n't buy either of these supposed " larger meanings			0
" @entity17 's biography shows many , many examples of decency , compassion , and human concern			1
many are told in the outstanding biography by @entity101 and @entity102 , including the most notable : in 1996 , the teenage daughter of one of @entity17 's @entity106 partners went missing after sneaking out to a rave party in @entity108 and ingesting the drug @entity109			1
@entity17 closed the firm and led every member in a search for the girl , finding and rescuing her			1
likewise , you would n't think there 'd be much scope to doubt the @entity117 of one who bets his presidency on a mission to kill @entity121 face to face rather than by the less risky means of a drone strike			0
anyway , a lot of 100 % @entity86 have eaten exotic foods			0
@entity126 favorably compared the flesh of young bears to the taste of pork			0
my friend in the @entity133 boasts proudly : " ' @entity134 ' is a military slang term for @entity136 ( aka " @entity137 " ) , and @entity138 we do eat snakes			0
this is part of our survival training , although i have slayed and eaten snake in the field to supplement the rations , and because basically , snake tastes good			0
" i have encountered snakes ( and eaten them ) throughout my career			0
i have eaten cobra in @entity149 ( and drank the blood mixed with @entity152 whiskey ) , @entity154 in @entity155 and copperhead @entity153			0
for what it 's worth , i prefer rattlesnake ; tastes like chicken			0
" yet i think there actually is a " larger meaning " inherent in these dog stories - just not the meanings that the partisans want us to see			2
the true larger meaning is that 2012 will be a contest between two candidates with weak grips on their base voters			1
the hard right suspects @entity17 values competence more than ideology			1
the @entity176 left is unhappy that @entity42 wo n't propose massive @entity178 - style job creation and wealth redistribution			1
to corral unexcited base voters , both campaigns must rely less on positive messaging ( what can they say ? ) and much more on galvanizing dislike and antipathy of " the other side			2
" the dueling dog stories do that job perfectly			2
which is why you 'll keep hearing about them through the long weeks of electioneering ahead			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			2

@entity196 : @entity17 has been *criticized* over *transporting* his dog on car roof
now some are making an issue of president @entity42 eating dog meat as a child
@entity196 says these ridiculous charges are a sign of the candidates ' weakness
he says each side is trying to energize a *disillusioned* base
