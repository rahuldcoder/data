-- @entity1 believes that connectivity is a human right			1
or at least that 's how he 's framing his new project , @entity5 , a partnership with leading companies in the smartphone industry to bring internet access to the developing world			1
you could be generous and call this enlightened self - interest , but more likely , @entity5 is a canny business move dressed up to sound like charity			1
in his overly earnest manifesto about the project , @entity1 declares , " for almost ten years , @entity16 has been on a mission to make the world more open and connected			1
for us , that means the entire world â € ” not just the richest , most developed countries			2
we 've made good progress , and today we connect more than 1.15 billion people through @entity16 each month			0
but as we started thinking about connecting the next 5 billion people , we realized something important : the vast majority of people in the world do n't have any access to the internet			1
" in other words , how do we help these people become our customers ? companies that support @entity5 include @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
they make their money building smartphones or the systems and services that help them run			0
@entity5 has a three - part plan for achieving its goal			1
develop cheaper means of access , specifically low - cost smartphones			0
find data efficiencies that will allow services like @entity16 to work with less bandwidth			0
create business models that will incentivize companies of all types to provide cheaper , more plentiful internet access in the targeted regions			1
while this outline sounds refreshing , the fact is , @entity16 and its partners have been pursuing them quite actively already			0
@entity5 is simply benevolent branding on what these companies were hard at work doing			2
@entity39 and @entity40 , for example , have been pushing their way into developing markets with low - cost smartphones			2
in terms of data efficiency , @entity16 has developed two projects , @entity75 and @entity16 on every phone , which allow the social network to run on feature phones with little bandwidth			0
these apps have propelled @entity16 's recent growth in @entity82 and @entity83			2
new business models have emerged in regions like the @entity86 , @entity83 and @entity87 , where @entity16 partnered with handset makers and mobile carriers to preload its services onto phones in exchange for incentivizing upgrades and more expensive data plans			0
will @entity1 's new initiative operate differently than these existing ventures ? the name certainly implies so			1
org domain it uses in its name is one of the original top - level domains created specifically for nonprofits			0
today , it is also used by academic institutions , open - source and community projects , and the philanthropic parts of for - profit corporations			0
a number of articles mistakenly referred to @entity5 as a nonprofit			1
it 's easy to see how they were confused			0
in the opening lines of his essay about the new project , @entity1 writes , " it may not actually be proï ¬			2

@entity1 is starting an initiative to bring internet access to developing world
@entity124 : @entity5 is a canny business move dressed up to sound like charity
he says some people have mistakenly assumed the initiative is a nonprofit , but it 's not
