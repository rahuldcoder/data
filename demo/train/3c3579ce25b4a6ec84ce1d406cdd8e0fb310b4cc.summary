-- @entity1 reports that the suspects in the deadly @entity4 bombings were planning to extend the killing spree to @entity6 barely qualifies as news in our city			1
@entity6 have lived through too much , too often , to get jumpy at the prospect of a failed attack by a pair of isolated maniacs			1
that might seem strange to outsiders , but @entity6 has come to accept its status as the world 's @entity18 terrorist target -- and defiantly refused to cower or collapse			1
this is the place , remember , that recently marked the 20 - year anniversary of the awful day when @entity25 - born @entity24 drove a rented truck into a parking lot beneath the @entity28 and exploded a bomb			0
six people were murdered , and more than 1,000 injured			0
with the hindsight of history , we now know the 1993 bombing was , in the words of the @entity36 , " something of a deadly dress rehearsal " for the terrible attack of 9/11 that destroyed the twin towers			1
but it was also a wake - up call to federal investigators , who uncovered a vast , frightening plot to wreak havoc in the city			1
in 1995 , a jury convicted 10 men -- led by blind , @entity50 - born @entity49 -- of conspiring to bomb the @entity51 , two major tunnels and a bridge , along with a federal office building			0
had the plot succeeded , it could have killed countless thousands of innocent people			0
ever since then , @entity6 and federal authorities have been on a high alert that has never relaxed			1
@entity6 is where the first @entity61 was created in the 1980s ; it combines personnel from different federal , state and local law enforcement agencies under the same roof to minimize conflicts and confusion in the effort			2
year after year , @entity6 have grown accustomed to press conferences featuring the @entity36 , customs officials , @entity6 police and other agencies revealing startling plots to bomb bridges , subways , airports , banks , synagogues and other targets			1
in 2009 , a tip to the task force broke up a ring that was planning to bomb the subways			0
in 2010 , @entity84 was arrested less than three days after trying to explode a car bomb in the middle of @entity87			2
in 2011 , a man named @entity89 was arrested on terrorism charges in a plot to bomb various sites around the city ( his trial is pending ) , and in 2012 a @entity96 - born student named @entity97 tried to detonate a bomb in front of the @entity100 ( he pleaded guilty and now faces a life sentence )			2
but even with one scary plot after another , @entity6 has set record high numbers for tourism and residents			2
one of the most thriving neighborhoods , in fact , is the area near the @entity28 , where a new , taller tower is nearly complete			0
one reason for the confidence of @entity6 is the extraordinary visibility and ingenuity of the @entity115			2
for example , officers are permanently stationed at the entrances of the city 's major bridges and tunnels , and police frogmen dive into city rivers every day , checking the bases of the bridges for bombs			0
police regularly stage anti-terrorism drills in which dozens of officers from all over the city are directed to converge quickly on a central spot , a practice run to minimize confusion if they need to swarm into an area during a real attack			0
and the @entity6 police have officers stationed in 11 cities around the world , tasked with tracking international anti-terrorism efforts and going to the scene of terrorist attacks			1
their job , in the words of police commissioner @entity144 , is to ask " the @entity6 question " : what can we learn that will shed light on possible dangers in the city ? the international team also directly relays information back to the @entity115 intelligence division			1
so when @entity144 and mayor @entity156 held a press conference to announce that the @entity159 bombing suspects were planning to travel to @entity87 to cause further mayhem , @entity6 pretty much shrugged it off			1
to an extraordinary extent -- and with good reason -- the city considers itself on permanent alert , with a high level of vigilance that is our best protection			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			0

@entity169 : police say @entity4 bombing suspects planning to strike in @entity87
he says news did *n't* faze @entity6 used to *constant* vigilance , police presence
he says plots since 1993 have made city build mighty , far - flung security infrastructure
