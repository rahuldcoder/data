-- so what did you do this weekend ? chances are , nothing as cool as the folks who traveled to @entity6 , @entity7 , to commemorate 25 years of " the @entity8 " at the @entity9			1
a quarter century ago , to the day , on june 7th , " the @entity8 " opened in movie theaters across the country			1
and while it came in behind " @entity19 , " released on the same opening weekend , the tale of a group of teens who embark on a treasure hunt to raise the money to save their homes -- all while being chased by a crazed crime family -- went on to become a cult classic			2
to celebrate the movie , fans at the festival ran a @entity25 race called the " @entity8			1
" they chatted with cast members -- including @entity27 and director @entity28 -- at a dinner where the main dish was @entity32 meatballs			2
and they were treated to a " @entity8 " - themed concert starring none other than @entity36 , the band of " @entity8 " actor @entity37			1
the @entity0 : @entity39 's 13 - year - old daughter becomes a fashion model wish you had gone ? me too			2
and here are 10 reasons why we still love " the @entity8 , " even after a quarter of a century : 1			1
" the @entity8 " is a movie about outcasts			1
( well , with the exception of cheerleader @entity50 who becomes an honorary member of the crew			2
) and you know how much we love nerd movies and tv shows			2
played by @entity58 , @entity58 was hilarious as the flick 's comic relief			0
when the @entity61 demand that he tell them everything , he begins one of the best monologues in 80s movie history			1
" in third grade , i cheated on my history exam			0
in fourth grade , i stole my uncle @entity68 's toupee and i glued it on my face when i was @entity72 in my @entity74 play			0
in fifth grade , i knocked my sister @entity76 down the stairs and blamed it on the dog			0
" you 'll be happy to know that @entity58 is no longer chunky and is now a hot , well - renowned entertainment lawyer in @entity82			0
the @entity0 : 6 celeb couples tell where they went on their first date 3			0
" the @entity8 " was the brainchild of @entity87			1
it was conceived during what i like to think of as his golden era -- nestled in between " @entity92 " and " @entity93			0
it 's hard to believe but true -- @entity95 and @entity37 first met because of " the @entity8			1
" " it was in the waiting room -- we were auditioning for the same role , " says @entity37 , who got the part of @entity97 in the flick			1
though @entity95 was frozen out of this one , they 'd become one of the iconic duos of the 80s			1
the @entity0 : a " @entity109 of @entity110 " is $ 11 million in debt -- how ? 5			0
" the @entity8 " had an awesome soundtrack , with tracks from 80s greats like @entity114 and @entity115			1
but the classic track of the movie was @entity119 's " @entity118 " -- the 12 - minute , two - part video starred not only the cast but 80s wrestling favorites like @entity123			2
we know @entity125 as the hottie from " @entity127 " and the tragic bad guy in " milk			0
" but his first role ? @entity131 -- the @entity8 who 's able to win the heart of cool girl @entity50			1
the @entity0 : the @entity135 was one big shillfest 7			0
i saw " the @entity8 " in the movie theater , and will never forget the scene where the group makes it through the maze of caverns and puzzles and ends in the cave where they first see one - @entity148 's ship			1
apparently , for the stars of the movie , too			2
director @entity28 did n't let them see the fully re-created ship because he wanted the authentic emotion of awe on film			2
" the @entity8 " had a good message -- mainly that kids could take action and make real change in their community			1
sure , they most likely would n't do it by finding a buried treasure from the 17th century , but still			0
the @entity0 : the 10 lamest celebrity publicity stunts 9			0
oh , and i almost forgot about @entity165			0
how do you not love a pre-teen who creates his own inventions like the " @entity170 , " the " @entity171 , " and the " @entity172 " ? i always wanted him and @entity174 to have a showdown			0
" the @entity8 " was thrilling the first time you saw it			1
but thanks to @entity180 playing it , oh , every weekend , we 've gotten to see it 90,000 times and get all the nuances			0
while rumors have circulated for years that " @entity186 " is in the works , it just does n't look like it 's going to happen			0
luckily , though , @entity28 is currently working on a @entity188 version of the story			0
