@entity0 -- @entity3 's relationships with women and his difficulties becoming part of a community away from a government mental hospital were spotlighted thursday during a hearing to discuss whether the man who tried to kill president @entity11 will eventually be allowed to live as an outpatient			1
an official at @entity14 , where @entity3 , 56 , has lived for decades after being found not guilty by reason of insanity , said @entity3 had been engaged to a former patient he met at the hospital			1
she was identified only as " @entity19 , " but the engagement recently ended			0
dr. @entity21 , the facility 's director of psychiatry , said @entity3 had given the woman " multiple rings			1
" @entity21 said @entity3 had told him he 'd explained to @entity19 he planned to spend more time visiting his mother 's home in @entity27 and would be spending less time with her			1
as a result of that conversation , " she 's withdrawn the physical affection that they shared , " @entity21 said			0
federal prosecutor @entity34 also questioned @entity21 about @entity3 's past relationship with a patient identified as " @entity37 said @entity3 had difficulty communicating with the woman because she was so psychotic , but he pursued the relationship because she was physically affectionate			1
@entity21 described @entity3 's actions as " poor judgment " motivated by his " desire for affection			2
" according to @entity21 , another doctor told @entity3 the relationship was ill - advised and eventually @entity3 ended it			1
@entity3 has been spending 10 days a month visiting his mother in @entity47 , @entity27 , where he works part time as a volunteer in the library at @entity52 , a mental health facility			1
doctors have been encouraging him to make friends in @entity47 and build a new life			2
@entity21 said @entity3 has had some difficulties			2
in one instance , he followed a suggestion to go to a singles group , but that did not turn out well			1
" he was asked to leave , " said @entity21 , because one participant was very uncomfortable with his presence			2
since @entity3 likes music and plays the guitar , one of his doctors suggested he go play for hospice patients			2
but @entity21 said @entity3 never went because the hospice was worried there might be negative publicity if the presidential assailant played there			2
another possible avenue for meeting people also has not panned out			0
@entity21 said @entity3 , when in @entity47 , had not been interested in going to a gym or participating in certain sports like golf or tennis , either because of arthritis or because he finds the activities unappealing			1
the doctor said @entity3 's " treatment team " wants him to spend more time in @entity47 and thinks he 'll be able to fit into the community much better			1
a clinical psychologist from @entity14 who has met with @entity3 five times conceded he 's been unable to form relationships in that small city so far , aside from those with family members			2
" he had not made a friend in @entity93 , " said @entity91			0
she stressed that @entity3 is an introvert and not the type to quickly make a lot of friends			2
" he 's just not someone who goes and out and meets people or is a social butterfly			0
" but @entity91 said @entity3 seems to have coped adequately when rejected in social situations and is " not showing signs of isolation			2
" @entity91 was involved in a psychological risk assessment of @entity3			0
both she and dr. @entity21 said @entity3 represents a low risk of engaging in violence if granted permission to spend more time away from his mental hospital			1
a multiple - day hearing began wednesday to discuss @entity14 ' recommendation that @entity3 be granted a series of eight longer visits ranging from 17 to 24 days			0
that plan also proposes that eventually the hospital would have the authority to let him live as a full - time outpatient			0
prosecutors oppose the plan , saying they are concerned @entity3 is still potentially a danger			0
in opening arguments tuesday , prosecutor @entity121 said the court should not allow @entity3 to be released " to protect public safety			0
" @entity125 said @entity127 agents will testify they kept an eye on @entity129 in @entity47 during the short periods of time earlier this year when he was allowed free time on his own			1
according to @entity125 , the agents will testify about several occasions when @entity3 deviated from agreed - upon plans for how he would spend his time			1
instead of going to movies , @entity3 went to bookstores where he looked at books about presidential assassinations and the failed @entity11 assassination attempt , the prosecutor said			1
but @entity3 's attorney , @entity141 , said thursday the actual @entity127 reports show he passed by bookshelves that had those books and other history titles but did not stop to read them			0
the controversy on the bookstore stops may continue until the @entity127 agents testify			0
the hearing resumes monday and is scheduled to run about a week and a half			0
the judge may then take some period of time to review the testimony before issuing his ruling on the hospital 's plan to gradually allow @entity3 greater freedom			1
so far , @entity3 has been sitting quietly and has shown no reaction to the testimony			0
on march 30 , 1981 , @entity3 waited for president @entity11 to leave a @entity0 hotel after a speech			1
he opened fire and hit @entity11 , his press secretary , @entity166 , @entity127 agent @entity167 and @entity0 police officer @entity168			0
all survived , but @entity166 suffered a serious head wound that permanently affected his mobility and his speech			0
@entity166 and his wife became advocates for gun control .			0
