-- this time , @entity1 wo n't be able to predict the winner			0
in a @entity3 already marked by stunning victories and catastrophic defeats , trying to guess the next @entity3 champion is pretty much moot			2
@entity8 is riding high after annihilating host country @entity10 7 - 1 in their semifinal , a defeat so brutal that @entity14 president @entity13 said she 'd never imagined such a horror in her worst nightmares			1
of course the @entity17 would love a repeat against @entity19			0
but if anyone can show grit and then calm under pressure , it 's the @entity24			0
their semifinal against the @entity26 came down to a heart - pounding penalty shootout , and @entity19 's 4 - 2 victory cemented the team 's first trip to the @entity3 final in 24 years			1
@entity17 and @entity24 have faced each other in the @entity3 finals twice before			1
back when @entity8 was still a country , it lost to @entity19 in 1986			1
four years later , @entity19 lost to @entity8 in 1990			1
sadly , unlike the last @entity3 in 2010 , there is no psychic cephalopod placing its bets on this year 's victor			0
in that tournament , @entity1 correctly predicted the outcome of eight consecutive matches , dooming @entity8 's hopes when he picked @entity44 in the semifinal and then also in the final			1
@entity1 died in his @entity17 aquarium later that year			0
no matter what happens sunday , it 's unlikely either squad will be as heartbroken as host team @entity10			2
as if their semifinal demolition by @entity8 was n't humiliating enough , the @entity14 did n't score a single goal in their attempt at redemption during saturday 's third - place match			2
the @entity57 finished off the @entity14 , 3 - 0			0
