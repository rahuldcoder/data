-- when it comes to football players , there are very few who can be held up as respectable role models			0
all too often , players are criticized for their off - field behaviour , alleged racist remarks , outbursts on @entity7 and end up gracing the front pages of newspapers for all the wrong reasons			0
@entity14 on the brink : @entity16 or swim for ' @entity14 ' ? but on a cold friday night in @entity19 with snow sweeping across the country , one football player really did make a difference			0
@entity23 , the @entity24 defender , who is an integral part of @entity27 's side , had only left home to go for a sandwich with his wife , @entity30			1
driving in hazardous wintry conditions , @entity23 decided to make the journey to his local sandwich shop to have a bite to eat			1
it is there that @entity23 takes up the story , telling @entity0 about his gesture as he drove through the city looking for people sleeping rough			2
he said : " we went for something to eat in a local sandwich chain and overheard the manager saying they had to throw out bags of sandwiches as they were about to close for the night			0
" my wife , @entity30 , who is a very caring and charitable person , asked if we could have them for the homeless rather than see them thrown in the bin			0
" they agreed and we drove around @entity24 for over an hour , but could n't find any homeless people as it was so cold out on the streets with all the snow			1
" we decided to tweet a plea and we were guided to a local charity shelter who looked after the homeless			1
" @entity62 defends @entity64 's @entity63 that tweet , which went viral , was picked up by a local homeless shelter which invited the pair to the venue			1
after giving out sandwiches and talking to the group , @entity23 joked he should have hit the kitchen to cook up some of his famous @entity73 omelette			1
he added : " they were obviously grateful and after chatting to the charity worker it is something we are going to do on a regular basis			0
it 's the least we can do , especially with it being so could outside at the moment			0
" i do n't know if we 'll be as lucky with the free sandwiches in future , so i may have to cook some of my special @entity73 omelettes instead ! " he later wrote on @entity7 : " wow we r amazed at the amount of tweets we r receiving			2
thanks a lot but it was just a little gesture we drove for only 1 hour and felt great			0
" @entity23 stated that he did not want the name of the shelter publicly named			2
@entity23 will now hope to put a smile on lots more @entity24 faces when he takes on @entity94 in the @entity95 saturday .			1
