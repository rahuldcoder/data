, and critics are sounding off			2
the new " @entity6 " focuses on an engineer ( @entity19 ) determined to solve a yearslong mystery and his frustrated son ( @entity10 ) , who just wants his dad to let it go			1
and of course , there are monsters			2
@entity27 of @entity28 found that mix of stories to be disjointed , saying the film " feels like two movies @entity32 - taped together			1
" " in one , @entity9 plays a nuclear engineer with a tragic past who 's racing to expose the truth about a series of seismic anomalies , @entity10 is his estranged soldier son , and @entity11 and @entity40 are a pair of exposition - spouting scientists trying to keep straight faces while talking about electromagnetic pulses and mankind 's hubris , " he wrote			2
" in the other , mammoth @entity48 beasts knock the snot out of one another			2
only one of these movies is any good			0
thankfully , it 's the monster one			0
" @entity54 of @entity55 seemed to agree			0
" it would take an insomniac to wade through all these plot complications without dozing , " @entity54 wrote			0
" the actors are top - tier , but they over-emote to sell a human drama that never rises above soap opera			1
@entity9 deserves better than a script that confuses hysterics with breaking bad			1
" the @entity65 ' @entity64 said that " 60 years after he first stomped on @entity67 , the big green lizard has been given fresh scales for the rebooted ' @entity6			1
' yet despite a few fiery breaths , there 's mostly hot air from a lot of serious actors slumming it			2
" @entity75 of @entity76 found much to praise in the scenes featuring the monster			0
" for better or for worse , depending on how you like the end result , @entity8 has made a film that stands apart from how pretty much anyone else would have handled this , and i like that he remembered how important ' awe ' is to something that hopes to be ' awesome , ' " @entity75 wrote			0
the @entity87 's @entity86 said that @entity8 delivers as a director			0
" rather than reaching for the low - hanging fruit of wall - to - wall action , @entity8 conjures up a mix of slowly escalating tension and visual - effects wizardry , " he wrote			0
" the result may not be the monster movie some audiences are expecting , but it 's something better : a summer blockbuster that actually leaves you wanting more			1
" speaking of wizardry , here are some fun facts about " @entity6 " : the sound design team of @entity103 and @entity104 used a @entity106 tour rig with a 100,000 - watt speaker about the size of a city block that they then pumped the monster 's sounds through so they could capture recordings in cars , rooftops and other places to get the most realistic echo possible			1
but what you think you are hearing with that @entity6 roar may be deceiving			1
the roar is actually octaves beyond the human range of hearing , so the design duo used special @entity125 microphones to slow the sound so it falls within audience 's hearing range .			0

some complain that " @entity6 " is disjointed
one critic *complains* that the script forces the actors to " over-emote "
another calls it " a summer blockbuster that actually leaves you wanting more "
