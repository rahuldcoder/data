-- test results on material found at the former @entity4 home of late gangster @entity9 have come back positive for human remains , a spokeswoman for the @entity4 medical examiner 's office said monday			1
an anthropological investigation is now under way on the material , said office spokeswoman @entity13			2
she said investigators will try to extract @entity15 from the remains to try to identify who was buried there			1
on wednesday night , investigators at @entity20 in @entity21 finished the search for remains possibly connected to a case that happened before 1996 , said a law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity last week			0
according to public records , the house is now owned by @entity9 's daughter , @entity30 , who declined tuesday to comment to @entity0			0
according to his obituary in the @entity32 , he was serving a 20 - years - to - life sentence in a @entity4 prison when he fell ill with cancer			0
@entity37 played @entity9 as @entity38 in the 1990 @entity40 classic mafia film " @entity41 , " and @entity9 is probably best known as the alleged mastermind of the 1978 @entity44 heist , an $ 8 million robbery at @entity46 , which was the largest robbery in history at the time			1
the source said that @entity9 and his cohorts , closely associated with top members of the @entity53 , also were allegedly involved in a number of other activities -- so the search in @entity21 may not be related to the @entity44 heist			0
