in the weeks before every @entity1 , @entity0 wields enormous power , like a modern - day @entity3 able to influence millions of romances -- depending on whether she detects just the slightest thing amiss			1
@entity0 is a federal inspector lording over the arrival of millions of roses and other flowers from @entity9 and elsewhere in @entity10 , intended for delivery to couples in the @entity13			1
her job is monumental : she and other @entity16 inspectors are now in one of their two busiest season of year -- @entity20 is the other one -- at the @entity21 near @entity22			1
in the span of six weeks , she and her crew will have sniffed , touched , reviewed and inspected shipments of cut stem flowers whose final count is expected to total more 19 million by @entity1 on friday			1
" we know that we are going to have an influx of fresh flowers , but we have a special operation to focus on more inspection " during the holiday madness , @entity0 said			2
as dizzying as that number is , the @entity13 - @entity9 border crossing at @entity35 , @entity36 , is hardly the nation 's busiest port for @entity41 floral inspections			1
that title goes to @entity43 , where during last year 's @entity41 season , officials processed a whopping 738.2 million cut flower stems shipped in from @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity9 and elsewhere			1
@entity35 ranked no. 3 among the nation 's busiest ports in processing @entity41 flowers last year and no. 6 for finding plant pests in shipments			1
a total of 59 little critters were found last year			0
for anyone who enjoys expressions of the heart , the @entity35 crossing is a snapshot -- or a metaphor for @entity3 's arrow in flight ? -- of how the delivery of @entity1 's roses can be a long and difficult journey			2
it 's not unlike , well , true love itself			0
what makes @entity0 ' job so important is that she must keep the bad flowers from possibly causing catastrophic damage to @entity13 soil			2
to do so , she and her colleagues ensure the flowers are free of disease , insects and microscopic pests that , if they found their way on @entity13 land , could wipe out swaths of @entity13 agricultural and floral industries			2
" what we do is we take a random sample out of each variety of flowers , and we do our inspection in either in an edit bay inside , or out on the dock , " @entity0 explained at the border crossing , where motorist traffic is routinely backed up for an hour or more			2
" what we are looking for is any variety of pest , " she added			0
" the ones that are reportable are the ones we already have here in the @entity13 , and the ones that are actionable are the ones that we actually do n't want in the @entity13 at all , because they are invasive , because they are a big problem for the @entity13 " cut flowers is a huge industry , and it 's very important we protect it all the time , " said @entity0 , who 's chief agriculture specialist			1
last year , inspectors found a total of 1,715 pests in @entity41 flowers at all ports of entry , federal figures shows			1
the most common insects intercepted were aphids , thrips , moths , miner flies and mites			0
such vigilance can mean headaches for the truckers who waited in standstill traffic at the busy @entity13 - @entity9 border -- only to be forced to turn around if they do n't pass @entity0 ' inspection			1
" i remember a few times they had sent me back , " trucker @entity127 said			0
that meant he had to return to @entity130 , @entity9 , near @entity131 , where he unloaded the flowers and had them fumigated to kill the bugs , he said			2
he eventually passed @entity13 inspection on a subsequent trip across the border , he said			0
it 's a necessary protection that @entity9 truckers such as @entity140 understand -- though they feel the deadline pressure from @entity13 markets to deliver the roses , dianthus , sunflowers and larkspur by february 14			1
" when our flowers are not clean , they send us back to @entity9 , and we have to clean them , take them down from the truck , and then come back , " said @entity148 , who has endured such failure to pass inspection several times			0
some rejections have resulted in a total loss for that shipment , he said			0
@entity148 also delivers flowers from @entity131 , located about 70 miles from the @entity13 - @entity9 border			1
" when that happens we lose money , time , and it 's a huge problem because we have to go back and ca n't deliver the flowers , " he added			0
" you really do n't know until you get here and they tell you that some of your flowers are infested			0
" despite such setbacks , the demand for love remains insatiable , the truckers say			0
" the last two weeks have been very busy because of the celebration of @entity1 , " @entity127 said .			0

@entity0 and crew review 19 million @entity41 flowers at @entity13 - @entity9 border
@entity1 and @entity20 are their busiest season for floral inspections
@entity9 truckers *lament* when inspectors find bugs and pests in floral deliveries
" cut flowers is a huge industry , and it 's very important we protect it , " @entity0 says
