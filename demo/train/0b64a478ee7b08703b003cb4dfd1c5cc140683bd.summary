@entity0 , @entity1 -- the sudden death of @entity1 's president , @entity4 , on july 24 did not come as a rude surprise			1
most @entity1 already knew his health was failing ; he was losing his eyesight and voice			1
for the seven months that i was in @entity1 ( dec 2011 - july 2012 ) , he rarely made a public appearance -- and despite official assertions to the contrary , most people did not believe he had the will nor the capacity to campaign for re-election in this year 's elections in december			1
thousands of mourners pay respects to their late leader what was remarkable , however , was that within hours of his death , the vice-president , @entity23 , had been sworn in as the new president			1
the smoothness of the transition was exactly how @entity4 would have wanted it			1
he was a man of peace and ardent believer in the rule of law			2
@entity1 in mourning after president dies the smooth transfer of power not only attested to the strength and stability of @entity1 's democracy but also stood in sharp contrast to the rocky and chaotic transitions that followed the deaths of presidents @entity43 of @entity44 in 1993 ; @entity45 of @entity46 in 2010 and @entity47 of @entity48 in 2012			1
@entity49 hailed @entity1 as ' model for democracy ' also standing in sharp contrast to the smooth political transition process is the performance of @entity1 's economy			1
after a stellar performance the past few years , the economy has hit some road bumps			0
at a time when @entity60 has been in deep crisis , @entity1 's economy galloped at a dizzying 14.5 % rate of growth in 2011			1
in the fourth quarter , the rate was an astonishing 16 %			0
the country achieved a single digit inflation rate of 8.6 % and the lowest fiscal deficit to gdp ratio of 4.8 % in decades , according to figures from the minister of finance			0
moreover , @entity1 attracted $ 7 billion in foreign investment -- the highest amount recorded in its history			1
this economic boom has been sparked by recent discovery and production of oil			2
however , prospects for 2012 have dimmed			0
the projected growth rate has been scaled back to 10 % , although still impressive			0
an @entity81 team which visited the country in june described the economy as " sick " -- perhaps , an unintended allusion to the condition of the president			2
the external value of the local currency , the cedi , has dropped precipitously from 1.4 cedis to the dollar in january 2.2 cedis to the dollar in july -- a drop of 57 % in terms of the local currency			2
that drop has made imports more expensive and pushed the rate of inflation up above 10 %			0
there is widespread grumbling about the rising cost of living			0
former @entity1 president : fight poverty with wealth creation , not charity it may seem skeptics , who questioned the sustainability of @entity1 's economic success , are being proven right			1
they point to @entity1 's neighbor , @entity44 , which was once declared an " economic miracle " back in the late 1990s but then convulsed into civil war and economic ruination in 2005 and 2010			1
they ask further : has n't oil been a curse to such countries as @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity46 , among others ? is @entity1 not destined to follow the same path ? to some extent , the skeptics have a point but that is not the whole picture			1
to be sure , @entity44 was declared an " economic miracle " in the late 1980s and in 1994 , the @entity129 declared @entity1 to be an economic success story			1
however , received wisdom and accumulated evidence suggest that doing well economically is not enough			0
intellectual freedom ( freedom of expression , of the media , etc. ) and political reform ( establishment of democratic pluralism ) are also needed to sustain economic prosperity			1
countries that resist them eventually implode , unraveling all the economic gains made			2
this was what happened in @entity44 in 2005 and also in @entity147 ( 1995 ) , @entity148 ( 1998 ) , @entity149 ( 2001 ) , @entity150 ( 2011 ) and @entity151 ( 2011 )			0
in other words , democracy is not necessary to engineer an economic success story but vital to sustain it			1
in @entity1 's case , incomplete political liberalization and fitful intellectual reform clipped its economic success in the 1990s			1
however , things are much different today			0
the intellectual environment is much freer now			0
there are more than 100 private radio stations and over 20 privately - owned newspapers in @entity1			1
there is a vibrant and vigilant media that sparks intense intellectual debates			0
call - in radio programs hold the feet of politicians to the fire and expose their shenanigans			0
now and then , the country 's @entity172 rules against the government			2
freedom of information bill is wending its way through @entity177 , although it has been dragging its feet			0
media 's role in @entity1 politics politically , democracy is also being entrenched			1
since 2000 , there have been two successful transfers of power without violence or bloodshed			2
and the smooth transfer of power after the president passed away is another feather in the @entity1 's democracy cap			1
all these bode well for the sustainability of the current economic prosperity			1
but still , some serious hurdles lie ahead for @entity1 's economic prosperity			1
first , the non-oil sector of the economy is performing poorly			0
@entity199 , which employs over 60 % of the population , grew marginally at 2.8 % in 2011			0
with food production per capita declining , the country has to rely on food imports to feed itself			0
the performance of the manufacturing sector has also been weak			0
it is hard to find a manufactured good with the label , " made in @entity1			1
" as @entity1 often lament , " we do n't produce anything ; we import everything from tooth - picks to toilet paper			2
" as a result , imports are surging dangerously out of control			0
@entity1 farmers lose out in gold mining boom the situation is eerily reminiscent of @entity46 in the 1980s when the country neglected its agriculture and manufacturing base and splurged on luxury imports			2
army chiefs parked @entity226 and even @entity227 outside plush government villas , while their children attended expensive schools in @entity231			0
one even had his @entity233 flown from @entity231 to @entity46			0
@entity46 , which used to export food in the 1960s , now spends over $ 120 billion [ latest figure i found ] on food imports while 61 % of @entity46 now live in poverty			0
there are other bumps as well on @entity1 's road to economic prosperity			1
the bloated size of the government suffocates the economy			2
in 1997 , there were 88 cabinet and regional ministers plus their deputy ministers in a country with a population of 25 million			0
by 2004 , the number had reached 92 but now down to 84			0
[ the @entity254 , with a population of 300 million , has 40 secretaries and assistant secretaries			0
] too many ministries means overlapping jurisdiction and functions and a bloated bureaucracy			1
indeed , the vice president , @entity23 , has been complaining persistently about " excessive bureaucracy and red - tapeism in the public sector " in the state - owned @entity266			2
the public sector is riddled with overspending , wasteful practices and financial irregularities and profligacy			2
the situation has become so dire that the government consumes all it collects in revenue , leaving it with little or no savings to finance investments			0
for example , in 2011 , total revenue stood at ghÂ ¢ 12 billion ( or $ 7.5 billion ) but general government expenditures added up to ghÂ ¢ 13 billion , leaving the government with negative savings			0
can @entity283 break its ' resource curse ' ? however , the biggest hurdle when i was in the country was the high level of anxiety , tension and uncertainty about the december poll			1
in times of uncertainty , investors hold on to their wallets and the rich park their wealth outside the country			2
capital flight and surging imports have evidently contributed to the sharp drop in the external value of the local currency			0
i left @entity1 for the @entity254 on july 21 and president @entity4 passed away on july 24			1
most likely , political tension in the country will abate somewhat as @entity1 put away their differences to mourn their departed president			1
however , the uncertainty will resurface after the burial			2
while the new president , @entity23 , is respected and level - headed , he is unlikely to accomplish much before december			2
one wag has urged @entity1 to vote for a " non-john " in december			1
since 1981 , @entity1 has had the following presidents : @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity4 , and now @entity23			1
@entity318 ! this is the worst form of name tribalism			0
time for a revolution , " the wag exclaims			0
well , @entity1 will decide in december			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity325 .			0

@entity1 , whose president @entity4 died in july , is holding elections in december
the smooth transfer of power after his death attests to the strength of @entity1 's democracy
yet , serious *obstacles* lie ahead for @entity1 's economic prosperity
uncertainty about elections , *coupled* with bloated bureaucracy and overspending , are the biggest hurdles
