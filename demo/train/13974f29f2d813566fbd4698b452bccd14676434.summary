-- almost two years after @entity2 plunged into the southern @entity3 killing all 228 people aboard , investigators have released a report on what they believe caused the crash			1
after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles , the aircraft 's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were found on the ocean floor at the beginning of may			1
after analyzing the data , @entity16 's @entity15 ( @entity15 ) released its report friday saying the flight from @entity20 to @entity21 crashed because the aircraft 's speed sensors gave invalid readings			1
when did @entity2 go down ? flight 447 -- which was en route to @entity21 from @entity20 -- made its last contact with @entity29 's @entity28 ( @entity30 ) at around 01:33 gmt on june 1 , 2009 , informing the center of the plane 's position as it crossed the @entity3			1
investigators : @entity36 crash data recovered soon after , @entity29 's air control contacted @entity40 's control center in @entity41 and reported that @entity2 was entering an area on its route known for constant bands of severe turbulence , officials said			1
there was no further contact with the plane			2
why has it taken so long to find the wreckage ? the area where the @entity52 went down is in the @entity53 -- two to four days for ships to reach from the nearest ports in @entity29 or @entity56 in @entity57			2
the @entity59 @entity58 estimates the ocean depth in the area at 3,000 meters ( about 9,840 feet ) to 7,500 meters ( 24,600 feet )			1
@entity29 officials have said the sea depth in the area is around 2,000 to 3,000 meters ( 6,562 to 9,842 feet )			1
the latest search covered a 46 - mile ( 75 - kilometer ) radius around the last known position of @entity2 , investigators said			1
according to the @entity15 the underwater terrain in this area is rough with underwater mountains and valleys			1
" it is a mountain range as big as the @entity75 , " @entity70 of @entity71 told @entity0 before the release of friday 's report			1
" there was always the possibility that the wreckage from the aircraft disappeared down a crevasse			0
this is not a flat - bottom environment like the @entity83 is			0
" " therefore it is an unprecedented search in terms of depth and sub-sea terrain			1
" what would happen to wreckage at these depths ? up until recently , the memory module of the aircraft 's data recorder -- a vital device for crash investigators which records any instructions sent to the aircraft 's electronic systems -- had been missing			1
as a result , some experts feared it would not work even if recovered			0
" pressure and corrosion have likely damaged the wreckage , especially as it has been down there for so long , " said @entity70			1
" flight recorders are not designed to withstand pressures of the depths that this aircraft actually went to			0
" but he warned that flight recorders recovered from other crash sites have not worked when they should have , with the reverse also true			1
do we know why @entity2 crashed ? the @entity15 report findings say the airplane climbed to 38,000 ft when " the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled			1
" it then descended , crashing into the @entity3			1
the descent lasted 3 minutes and 30 seconds and the engines remained operational , said the report			2
studies of the debris and bodies that were found soon after the crash led the @entity15 to conclude the plane hit the water belly first , essentially intact			2
oxygen masks were not deployed , indicating that the cabin did not depressurize , the @entity15 said in a 2009 report			1
tests have already brought into question the performance of pitot tubes , which measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air , and are part of a system used to determine air speed			1
before it crashed , @entity2 sent out 24 automated error messages that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through the thunderstorms , officials have said			1
the @entity146 issued a directive in late august requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by @entity150 on @entity151 and @entity152			0
it said airlines should replace them with other @entity150 tubes and those manufactured by @entity158			0
the lack of speed , wind or direction information also prevented the autopilot system from functioning , said air accident investigator @entity164 said at the time of the crash			1
" this tells us that the plane has to be , in this case , directed by the pilot , " he said			0
what about the weather ? flight 447 was passing through an area prone to volatile and dangerous weather known as the @entity177 ( @entity177 ) , when it went down			0
the @entity177 is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet			2
clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world 's hemispheres meet			0
here , air and water temperatures are typically in the mid- 80s			2
the warm , moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. steamy air , coming off the ocean , rises until it hits cooler , drier air aloft , forming clouds and thunderstorms			2
these gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph			0
the height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air			2
even if you stacked two dozen of the world 's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other , they still would n't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the @entity177			0
however @entity70 pointed out that hundreds of airliners pass through the @entity177 every day without incident			0
" there was another @entity216 flight 30 minutes behind @entity2 that night and it encountered no problems , " he said			1
any other theories ? according to @entity70 , many aviation experts have yet to rule out the human factor			2
" the crash happened at around 2 am on a dark night when the error messages suddenly appeared and the autopilot tripped out			2
" he said the crew , possibly at their deepest circadian low at this point , suddenly have this problem and they " fixate " on it			0
" this is a syndrome , " he said			0
" there have been lots of accidents where pilots have fixated on correcting a relatively minor problem and lose sight of the macro problem			0
now we do n't know that , but we do know the aircraft acted as if it was not being controlled purposefully			0
" whether it was out of control -- and i doubt this -- it was not being controlled			0
imagine it is 2 am and two sleepy pilots encounter a problem			0
they do n't have much to do so they decide to troubleshoot this problem			0
they fixate on it and forget the autopilot has tripped			0
" the airplane meanwhile goes into a lazy spiral descent -- the pilots do n't notice as it is all very gentle			0
and when they look up they do n't believe what their instruments tell them and they get disorientated and ca n't recover			2
" he highlighted a similar case in 2004 when pilot disorientation and loss of control caused a @entity266 737 - 300 to crash in the @entity267 shortly after take off from the @entity269 resort of @entity270			1
though @entity269 authorities disputed the claim , aviation safety officials in @entity16 and the @entity59 cited " spatial disorientation " as the likely cause based on evidence available , according to the @entity276 ( @entity276 ) .			0
