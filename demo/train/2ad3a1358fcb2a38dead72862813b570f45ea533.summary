-- digging my hands deep into my pockets , i tucked my chin into my fleecy neck warmer and wriggled my toes to warm them up			2
snowflakes had filled the sky with white and were now dusting the ground gently			2
there was something beautiful about it , although somehow that does n't seem right to say -- because i was standing amid acres of wrecked homes -- or rather plots where homes once stood			2
fifty meters away a cemetery 's toppled gravestones stood awkwardly			2
one hundred meters beyond , at the foot of the hill , the scorched carcass of a school , grave and gray , watched over it all			0
i was in @entity26 , a fishing town on the @entity27 of @entity28			1
it was one of the worst - hit areas by the earthquake and tsunami which struck the country on march 11th 2011			1
nine months later , it was slowly plodding along the path to recovery			0
@entity37 : to world 's end and back having finished the first stage of my human - powered journey from ' @entity42 : @entity45 ' in november after arriving in @entity43 on my bike , i had returned to @entity26 to volunteer with ' it 's not just @entity47 ' ( @entity48 )			1
the group had been set up earlier in the year by @entity51 chap @entity50 after quitting his job as an @entity54 teacher in @entity55 and heading north to help			1
having cycled through the town on my way to the capital , i decided i wanted to help and after a quick internet search came across @entity50 and his group			0
i spent a week with @entity48 just before @entity61 , living in the two houses that @entity50 acquired via @entity63 earlier this year -- at one point we had 20 of us from seven different countries , bringing with us varied backgrounds and stories			1
tasks ranged from house clearing to cleaning , bleaching and pressure washing , carpentry and gardening , insulating and decorating and cooking			0
the day that stands out most for me was the snowy day at the foot of the hill			0
here , our little group worked alongside a local woman , @entity83 , to plant some flowers and bulbs in the plot where her house once stood			0
building has been forbidden here in future but @entity83 wanted her little garden amongst the rubble to remain as a memorial to the thousands of lives lost in the tsunami			1
as we knelt on the cold ground and worked the soil , gently introducing the plants and bulbs to their new home , we alternately chattered and giggled and remembered quietly			1
we planted the flowers in a heart shape , sketched out in the snow by @entity83			0
i tried to imagine what it must feel like to be her			0
to be kneeling on the ground that you once called home , now empty and exposed			1
what it must feel like to look at your home town and see most of it destroyed			1
i wandered off to pay my respects to this town and try and take it all in , treading carefully over the ground , aware that i had walked ' through ' many lives in doing so - stepping easily over foundations where walls once contained families and histories and hopes and dreams			1
it reminded me of post-apocalyptic scenes from films and it still felt surreal , even though i had been there for a whole week			0
once we had finished planting , @entity131 walked to the plot behind and knelt down , chin tucked into her fleece			1
she took the single flower which she had put aside and worked it carefully into the soil			0
this was the house of her elderly neighbor			0
like nearly 18,000 others on the @entity28 coast , she had n't survived the tsunami in march			1
tears rolled down my cheek as i stood and watched this final act of remembrance , perhaps the outpouring of all the emotions that i had felt that week as i played a tiny part in this huge journey of renewal			1
i interviewed @entity83 about her experience on march 11th and she told me how she and her husband had been at work			0
her youngest daughter had been at home			2
luckily she evacuated to the school and then the hill , but neither had known if the other was safe for hours and @entity83 still felt guilty about not hearing her daughter 's repeated phone calls as she frantically decided what to do			2
many people have left the region , adding to the existing issues of rural depopulation as young people flock to the cities			2
@entity26 has launched it 's own revival programme , ' @entity172 ' , encouraging people to come back to the town and start a life there , supporting and promoting community projects and local business			0
with sensible and adequate investment , powered by the grit and tenacity that the @entity28 are renowned for , i think there is hope that the scars can heal and the region will flourish one day			1
it is a beautiful area and has much to offer tourists -- it just needs time and resources , and an understanding that the threat posed by radiation is not a barrier to living in or visiting the region			2
it will be a long road to do so , but there is hope			0
i asked @entity131 what her hope was for the new year and she said that she wished for health and happiness for her family			0
she said that they would smile and recover one day , but that it was very difficult			0
her closing words were thank yous -- to us for helping with her gardening and to everyone around the world for their support			1
my hope is that the people of @entity214 are not forgotten and that the support -- be it investment , sponsorship or volunteering - continues to grow			1
having seen the hyperbole around the @entity220 plant meltdown and fallout at @entity222 , i hope that good sense will prevail and that propaganda can be used as a positive force and that truth and transparency are not lost			0
i shall return to @entity26 to volunteer again before i leave for my ocean row in april , and shall carry the @entity214 spirit and story with me as i head back home to @entity232			1
for this expedition has shown me that we are all on journeys , whether rounding the world on a bike and boats or not			2
we are all one .			0

@entity37 took a different journey in the worst - hit area during the earthquake in @entity28
the @entity51 *adventurer* has earlier finished the first stage of her world - crossing journey
her first volunteer task to create a garden on a former home site left a *touching* memory
