in 1945 , not long after attending a historic meeting with @entity2 and @entity3 and mere weeks before dying , president @entity0 addressed @entity4			1
frail from years of declining health , @entity0 was forced to give his last report to @entity4 sitting down , but many of the words he spoke that day were strong : " the structure of world peace can not be the work of one man , or one party , or one nation , it can not be just an @entity17 peace , or @entity19 peace , or a @entity20 , or a @entity21 or a @entity23 peace			1
it can not be a peace of large nations -- or of small nations			2
it must be a peace which rests on the cooperative effort of the whole world			2
" over the past few months we have heard a lot of rhetoric from @entity36 candidates about the supposed weakness of president @entity38 in relation to foreign policy -- specifically his willingness to apologize when the @entity17 has inadvertently hurt or offended another nation			1
it seems his challengers ' idea of strength is to never admit that you are wrong , which any therapist will tell you is more of a reflection of a person 's insecurity and weakness than of resolve or strength			1
and given the number of times the @entity61 administration apologized -- to countries like @entity63 , @entity23 and @entity64 -- you would think this bunch of @entity61 wannabes would want to be more careful in describing the behavior they consider weak			2
now , i understand it is an election year and certainly president @entity38 is as guilty as his opponents of being overtly political -- for example , holding a press conference the day of his rivals ' @entity76 contests			1
but the no - apology theme that has become part of the @entity36 campaign fabric harms the ability of this and future presidents to lead the kind of cooperative effort @entity0 spoke of nearly 70 years ago			1
it is extremely shortsighted of @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 to willfully cloud international diplomacy for some misguided cheers and a few lousy delegates			1
it 's irresponsible and it 's counterproductive , for as @entity0 pointed out in his last days , even the strongest of nations need the cooperation of others to achieve the ultimate goal of peace			1
it is hard to get them to rally behind you when you behave as the world 's bully			2
we can bribe countries with financial aid , we can scare them with military might , but all that only buys time			2
it masks resentment or delays war			2
but it does n't bring peace			1
only humility can do that			2
our light as a nation shines brightest not when we tout our greatness but when we behave selflessly			0
the core of our character is epitomized by our willingness to fight injustices beyond our borders			1
but all that is undermined when we ignore the injustices -- intentional or not -- that @entity17 commits			1
acknowledging that we are not above reproach only adds to our credibility			0
and we are going to need all the influence we can muster			0
when i look around , i see a planet at a critical juncture in history			0
the nuclear threat in @entity137 is unnerving , but it is only one of many challenges we face			0
we have a looming energy crisis and global food shortage because of rapid population growth			0
some of these issues we simply can not just bully our way past			0
we 're going to have to sit down with our friends as well as enemies			0
after all , no war has ever ended without both at the table			0
read some of the featured comments on this article we 're also going to need to be a part of the global community in a cooperative way -- and sometimes that will mean leading			0
sometimes that will mean following			0
and yes , sometimes that will mean apologizing			0
we should have apologized for testing syphilis on unsuspecting @entity161 in the 1960s , and i 'm glad president @entity38 did			1
we should want to apologize for reneging on the promises made to the @entity166 veterans who helped us fight in @entity167 and i 'm glad we apologized for the unintentional burning of the @entity169 in @entity170			1
who knows how much worse the situation surrounding the massacre that left 16 civilian @entity170 dead would be if president @entity38 had n't apologized for that earlier offense ? doing so did n't make him or the country weak , it made us strong			1
@entity177 is never having the guts to say " i 'm sorry			0
" or berating the person who does .			0

@entity36 have criticized president @entity38 , saying he apologizes for the @entity17
@entity182 says @entity38 has rightly admitted **mistakes** the @entity17 has made
he says a willingness to admit fault is *crucial* to gaining international cooperation
@entity182 : admitting our **mistakes** is n't a weakness but a strength
