professional climbers @entity0 and @entity3 may be hours away from reaching a new height : the top of @entity6 in @entity7			1
since december 27 , @entity0 and @entity3 have been scaling the 3,000 - foot rock formation			1
now , it appears the duo will reach the summit on wednesday or thursday			2
the route @entity0 and @entity13 are attempting is the notoriously difficult @entity14 , more than a half mile high			2
there are many routes up @entity6 , but only a handful have been attempted by climbers trying to free climb -- using only their hands and feet -- with ropes designed only to catch them when they fall			1
and none have successfully conquered @entity6 's @entity14			2
perhaps no route is more challenging than the @entity28 , which offers few footholds and may be the most difficult climb in the world			0
if they succeed , @entity0 and @entity3 would be the first to successfully free - climb the @entity14 , @entity7 officials confirmed			1
for @entity0 , it 's a dream that has been in the making for several years			2
an accomplished climber , @entity0 already completed five other routes on @entity6 , according to his bio			1
but family members say the @entity14 route is one that has consumed him			0
" he was looking for more of a challenge " said @entity0 's father @entity42			2
" he started going up and repelling down and trying to see if he could see holds that could turn into a climb			0
over a two - year period , he probably spent 25 - 30 days on the wall just looking it over			0
" @entity3 , who started climbing competitively as a teenager , did n't know @entity0 until he decided to join him on the climb			1
" @entity3 called @entity54 offering to help with the climb and that 's how they met , " @entity52 said			0
the team attempted an earlier push on the project several years ago , but were shut down due to weather , according to @entity0 's facebook page			0
the anticipation of completing the climb is generating excitement , with family members headed to the mountain			0
@entity0 's wife left @entity67 monday headed to @entity7 , and @entity0 's parents are heading that way tuesday			1
the climbers , meanwhile , have expressed the adventure 's joys and heartaches through various social media accounts			0
follow their journey on @entity0 and @entity3 's @entity77 accounts , @entity0 and @entity3 's @entity79 accounts and @entity80			1
