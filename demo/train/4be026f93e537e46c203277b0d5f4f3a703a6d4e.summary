september 11 has been somewhat eclipsed in the last decade by a more notorious anniversary , but it remains a date etched in @entity4 ' minds : in 1973 , this was the day general @entity6 seized power from the democratically elected @entity9 government of @entity10			1
forty years after that sudden coup , and 23 years since its return to democracy , @entity4 is still recovering from the effects of @entity6 's brutal rule			1
its relevance today may not be immediately obvious			2
the world 's attention is focused firmly on the @entity20 , particularly the brutal civil war in @entity22			1
as the international community debates what its responsibilities might be , people are dying			2
the shadow of @entity28 looms large , obscuring and darkening the potential consequences of humanitarian intervention			2
yet among all this , @entity4 's influence can be felt			1
@entity33 , 70 , is a @entity34 human rights activist and special advisor at @entity36 ; he argues that " what happened in @entity4 goes beyond its borders , because it shook the international community into understanding that human rights violations were the business of everybody , inside @entity4 and outside @entity4			2
" @entity33 visited the country many times during @entity6 's rule , documenting abuses and disappearances , and has since campaigned tirelessly on behalf of the relatives of the disappeared			1
four decades after coup , divisions remain in @entity4 @entity54 is one of many thousands who were detained and tortured by the @entity6 regime			1
now 68 and living in @entity58 , before the coup he worked for the @entity61 government , specifically for @entity62 , while also working as part of the @entity64			1
when the government was overthrown , he remembers how suddenly it happened : " in a way , we were expecting something would happen			1
[ but ] we never expected it would happen so quickly , and in such a way			2
" by sheer luck , @entity54 had been at meetings when the militia raided his apartment , and initially avoided capture			2
seeing what was happening , he decided to head for the @entity64 headquarters in the center of @entity80			2
" it was quite near to the presidential palace , and on my way i saw bodies in the street			2
the military immediately started shooting and killing people ... and very soon they put fire to the @entity64 headquarters			2
" that was the day , there was just shooting everywhere and killing everywhere			2
" by the end of that bloody day , president @entity10 was dead , having committed suicide as troops stormed the presidential palace			1
within 24 hours , the @entity9 government had been deposed and replaced by a military junta			1
some were pleased , particularly in the @entity100 , where the coup enjoyed the covert support of the @entity104 administration			1
@entity10 's sweeping nationalizations and quite radical reforms had proved unpalatable for many @entity4 and outside observers , particularly transnational corporations			1
after the coup , free market economic policies were pursued with vigor , inspired by the theories of @entity114 - winning economist @entity113 and others			1
as for the @entity64 members , @entity54 recalls what happened next : " the leaders of the party were detained , some were killed , and some went underground			1
so i spent six months underground , working there , just trying to get everything back into place ... [ eventually ] someone i was working with gave my name and i was detained			1
they came to my house and almost ransacked everything ... i was with two little children and was taken away			0
" @entity54 spent months in detention , being moved around to different locations and tortured regularly			1
in one prison , he found he recognized the voice of the person in charge : it belonged to a man called @entity138 , whom he had known before the coup -- not that this changed anything			1
" they were not shy -- in a way they wanted you to know who they were			0
" @entity33 says " the torturers were mentally prepared to torture because they felt they were defending the country			0
" today , @entity54 still remains baffled by this			0
" it was impossible for them to believe that what they were doing was wrong			0
this is the kind of ideology where you 've convinced the people it 's right to torture , right to kill , right to rape the women , right to ... whatever they did , that it was right			1
" he shakes his head			0
" and that was incredible			0
" eventually , @entity54 managed an extraordinary escape			0
he was first exiled to @entity168 , before being kidnapped again by the @entity4 secret police			0
they intended to take him back to @entity80 , but first the plane had to stop over at @entity58 's @entity172			1
he says , " when i arrived to @entity58 , i realised it was my only chance to escape			0
" fortunately , he says , his guards had gotten drunk and had fallen asleep			0
" i dashed outside the plane , and asked for political asylum			0
" @entity54 spoke practically no @entity179 , and was nearly returned to @entity4 -- at the time , the @entity178 prime minister @entity177 and @entity6 had a famously close relationship			1
however , he managed to contact @entity36 , who in turn got @entity183 to raise the case in parliament			0
@entity186 was granted , " and it saved my life , that 's why i 'm here			1
" so what lessons can the events of @entity4 40 years ago offer to us today ? " some of the lessons are quite clear , " @entity33 says			0
" what happens inside the country is not just a matter for the national authorities			0
human rights are something that we are all responsible for			0
when there is a disappearance in @entity4 , or in @entity203 , or in other countries [ like ] @entity205 , the @entity206 , it is also humanity that is aggressed			0
i am also a victim of these violations , even if it 's not in my country			1
because i am a human being ... the lesson of @entity4 is that these human rights are a responsibility of everybody			0
" of course , such platitudes do n't make the dilemmas presented in @entity218 , @entity22 and elsewhere any easier to grapple with -- and @entity33 accepts that international treaties and humanitarian agreements do n't themselves prevent violations and violence			0
" you also need the political will of governments inside the countries , and those who are outside to exert the pressure to help the people who are victims , " @entity33 says			0
" and you can see that that is not working the case of @entity22			0
" nevertheless , @entity33 says organizations such as @entity36 are ready			0
" even in very difficult circumstances , it 's very important to document violations ... certainly the lessons of other countries like @entity4 and @entity203 [ are that ] when the conflict ends , then it will be time for accountability			1
" though he has travelled around the world 's most troubled and violent regions for decades , @entity33 is not despondent			2
he points to the ongoing trial of 92 - year - old @entity244 , a former @entity246 officer , as an example that international law has a long memory			0
" it takes time , " he says			0
" but there will be justice			2
