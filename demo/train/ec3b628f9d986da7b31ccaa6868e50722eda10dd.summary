-- we 've seen some major world events unfold on the social media stage in the past week , the biggest being @entity2 's threat to pull out of @entity3 and the @entity5 earthquake			1
@entity2 's actions have brought attention back to the long - standing internet censorship that blankets @entity3 , while the destruction in @entity5 has mobilized hundreds of thousands to open their wallets and their hearts			1
just like the @entity17 election crisis , those events are causing people to reassess the impact of social media on the world			1
it 's clear that social media has the power to impact world politics and the lives of billions , but some have overstated what social media can actually do			1
we need to understand what social media really is in order to use it effectively for social good			2
@entity33 : looking for loved ones in @entity5 let me explain by highlighting a few examples of social media 's impact on the world stage , and then concluding with how i view social media 's impact in the larger context of mobilization and world discussion			1
@entity17 election crisis during summer 2009 , the world 's eyes were fixated on @entity17			0
questions were raised after @entity49 was declared the winner over rival @entity51 in @entity17 's presidential elections			0
the abnormalities and potential tampering of the vote resulted in massive protests that engulfed the @entity59 nation			0
social media 's role in the @entity62 started with # @entity63 , but that was only the beginning of social media 's role			1
with the @entity17 government clamping down on information and enforcing censorship , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71 became the primary mediums for bringing information out of the conflicted nation and spreading notes between dissidents			0
take a look at the @entity17 election social media timeline we built if you want to see its full impact			1
key moments in the crisis , especially the death of @entity88 , were recorded and spread like wildfire , creating an outpouring of support for the protesters			0
@entity68 's role was so important in fact that the @entity96 government got involved in scheduling @entity68 's downtime			0
in the end though , social media did n't topple any governments , although it has helped shift the political climate in @entity17			1
in some cases the use of @entity68 in @entity17 was overstated , yet the result is that the tipping point for @entity17 is close , thanks to social media			1
@entity5 earthquake after a magnitude 7.0 earthquake ( and multiple aftershocks ) devastated the nation of @entity5 , social media became the medium in which everybody spread the word			1
dramatic @entity5 earthquake @entity68 pictures swept across the @entity119 , while tech giants mobilized			0
@entity33 : earthquake rocks @entity5 the most impressive part of social media 's impact on @entity5 has to be the charity text message campaign that has already raised more than $ 10 million for @entity5 victim relief			1
social media spread the word			2
it 's not all perfect , though : the money raised is small compared to the relief coming from world governments and donations face 90 day delays			0
still , social media for social good is becoming more effective with each crisis			2
@entity3 - @entity2 standoff while we are still far from the conclusion of this messy affair , @entity2 's threat to pull out of @entity3 has already had a dramatic effect in both social media and political circles			1
politically , @entity3 has been put under pressure			0
the @entity96 government has thrown its support behind @entity2 , though it 's doubtful that the @entity152 will get involved in the end			0
more importantly though , social media is being used to lift @entity3 's blanket of censorship			1
social tools , while many are blocked by the @entity3 , can get through @entity3 's great firewall			2
we have the tools to undo censorship in @entity3			0
@entity2 's efforts have re-ignited the debate over censorship , but they wo n't break the barrier			0
social media 's global impact in all three cases -- @entity3 , @entity5 and @entity17 -- social media has had an impact , especially as the course of events evolved			1
real - time communication platforms like @entity68 and @entity69 have spread the word about what 's happening within these nations , long before the mainstream media prints the story			0
these tools have also created a level awareness we 've never seen before			0
@entity33 : i 'm alive ! messages from @entity5 we have to be realistic , though : new media is n't going to stop censorship , overthrow oppressive regimes or heal the people of @entity5 alone			2
social media has transformed communication , media , and the transmission of information , but it still takes people on the ground to pull people out of the rubble or to fight for freedom			2
just as @entity203 embarked on his midnight ride to warn that the @entity206 were coming , social media acts as both the first warning and the rallying cry for mobilization			2
in the end though , social media is just a collection of tools			2
it 's up to us , the people , to make the real impact on our world			0
