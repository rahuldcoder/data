@entity0 -- an @entity3 military court has sentenced an activist blogger critical of the army to three years in prison , and it did so without his lawyers present , a development that drew stiff condemnation by human rights groups			1
@entity11 , who was sentenced monday morning , had been arrested on march 28 and charged with defaming the army and spreading false information , according to his lawyer , @entity13			1
a general in charge of the " @entity16 " of the @entity17 said on television that " @entity11 had used ' inappropriate language ' and defamed the military , and that his calls for an end to military conscription would have a negative effect on the youth of @entity3 , " according to @entity26			1
@entity27 , deputy @entity28 director at @entity26 , said the sentence " may be the worst strike against free expression in @entity3 since the ( @entity32 ) @entity32 government jailed the first blogger for four years in 2007			1
" his group , which issued a statement on the sentence , said @entity11 's trial " has serious implications for freedom of expression on the internet more generally and in particular the ability to expose military abuses			1
" " the sentence is not only severe , but it was imposed by a military tribunal after an unfair trial , " @entity27 said			2
@entity50 spokesman @entity49 said tuesday that the @entity52 government is " deeply concerned " about @entity11 's sentence			1
" this is not the kind of progress we 're looking for , " he said			0
former @entity50 spokesman @entity58 said @entity11 's imprisonment " calls into question whether a democratic transition is under way in @entity3			1
" @entity11 's case is the latest in a series of incidents in which the @entity67 military regime has cracked down on protesters and other opponents			1
hundreds of protesters calling for @entity32 's prosecution were forced to flee @entity0 's @entity72 saturday when scores of soldiers backed by armored personnel carriers launched a raid against them			2
earlier in the week , several military officers took to the @entity78 , recording video statements accusing the chairman of the country 's ruling council , field marshal @entity80 , of protecting @entity32 from prosecution and of leading a counterrevolutionary movement			2
@entity11 ran afoul of the army by blogging about claims of violence against protesters during the uprising earlier this year , including use of the @entity3 museum for torture , as well as virginity tests on females and the army supplying police with weapons , @entity95 told @entity1			1
@entity11 also claimed on his blog that he had been arrested , sexually assaulted and beaten by army intelligence forces , @entity13 said			2
@entity13 said neither @entity11 nor his lawyers were present for the hearing in which his client was sentenced			2
@entity26 , the @entity104 and @entity95 said the military told defense attorneys that there would be no court session on the day he was sentenced			0
" he was supposed to show up at court ( on ) tuesday but we were tricked , " @entity13 said			2
@entity26 said the judge had announced last wednesday that he would rule sunday after defense lawyers finished their pleadings			0
@entity11 's lawyers were told that no session would be held and the judge would rule on tuesday			1
@entity13 told @entity26 that when lawyers went to the court complex monday " they saw on the court roll that the court had already sentenced @entity11 the day before			1
" the absence of lawyers violates the military code of justice , @entity95 and the groups said			0
the @entity104 said @entity11 's freedom was " shackled and stolen			1
" " this behavior raises suspicions and doubts on the fairness of the trial , not only for being a military trial for a civilian over his opinions , but in the context of the proceedings of similar trials against other civilians , considering the fact that the army refused to admit committing torture against @entity3 youth or apologize for this behavior , " the group said in a statement			0
the human rights organizations that signed the statement said , " we will not keep silent about torture or unfair trials , even if we wrote about these crimes on the walls in the streets			0
" " an atmosphere of fear and obscurity is the last thing needed for a revolution to thrive , instead of openness , transparency and justice , for which @entity3 have struggled for so long and will not give in , " the @entity157 network statement said			0
president @entity32 resigned two months ago , a departure prompted by a grass - roots and popular uprising , and the military eventually took the reins of power			0
@entity26 and the @entity104 said the @entity3 news media has not been bold on covering reports of torture by the military over the past two months			0
" two news conferences by human rights lawyers in which torture victims testified -- a subject that independent newspapers and satellite tv stations usually cover -- received almost no coverage			0
only a limited number of opinion writers in some newspapers and certain tv hosts have been willing to raise the issue of torture by the military , " @entity26 said			0
it criticized gen. @entity190 , the @entity191 chief , for telling newspapers " not to publish any articles / news / press releases / complaints / advertising / pictures concerning the armed forces or the leadership of the armed forces " without consulting his directorate and military intelligence			2
" state institutions , including the military , should never consider themselves above criticism , " @entity27 said			0
" it is only through a public airing of abuses and full accountability measures that @entity3 can hope to transition away from past human rights violations			0

@entity213 's lawyer says " we were tricked "
@entity11 gets three years in prison
" @entity219 " chief cites " inappropriate language "
his sentence on monday turned out to be a *surprise*
