-- an @entity2 man who was held in @entity3 for nearly four months in connection with the disappearance of his traveling companion insisted thursday he had nothing to do with her vanishing but said it will " weigh heavily on me for a very long time			1
" " i feel as if a person i cared about , a companion ... has disappeared on my watch , " @entity11 said on @entity13 's " @entity12 " in his first interview since being released from custody in @entity3 earlier this week			1
@entity11 , 50 , had been held in the disappearance of 35 - year - old @entity19 of @entity20			1
@entity11 told authorities the two were snorkeling on august 2 when he signaled to @entity19 to swim back			1
when he reached the beach , he told police , @entity19 was nowhere to be found and has not been seen since			2
" i only looked back when i hit a rock , " he said , according to a transcript of a police interview obtained by @entity0			0
" before that , i did not look back			0
i was busy saving my life			0
" @entity3 judges repeatedly granted requests to extend @entity11 's detention , while the investigation continued			1
but last week , a judge rejected prosecutors ' request to hold @entity11 , of @entity37 , @entity20 , for an additional 30 days			1
a three - judge panel of @entity3 judges held a hearing wednesday to review the decision to release @entity11 , but upheld it			1
@entity13 aired a clip of an emotional @entity11 learning of the decision at the airport			2
" i 'd accepted the fact that they were going to keep me from my kids forever , " he told reporters in the video			0
@entity3 prosecutor @entity50 said monday he was aware @entity11 was going to return home after being freed			1
" if we need him again , we will seek extradition with the @entity2 , " he said			0
the unresolved case has raised a host of questions , including the nature of the relationship between @entity19 and @entity11			1
his @entity2 - based lawyer , @entity60 , told @entity62 's @entity61 on thursday night that the two were both single and their personal activities -- including photographs taken by @entity11 of the people that have been widely speculated about -- are irrelevant to what happened on the beach that summer day			1
" what they do in the privacy of their own bedroom is their business , and really has nothing to do with this except scandalizing the case and trying to cast more aspersions on @entity11 and his lifestyle , " @entity60 said			2
the attorney said that the couple were " not exclusive			0
" responding to a question about whether @entity11 was a swinger , @entity60 said , " @entity11 has a different lifestyle than perhaps you and i. " " these were things that the this couple did , and they did not only with each other but with other individuals , " the lawyer added , referring to what transpired involving @entity11 and @entity19 before she went missing			1
in his own interview thursday with @entity13 , @entity11 -- flanked , at the time , by @entity60 -- disputed allegations he and @entity19 had been drinking and that he took her to a " remote location			1
" " we were a sober couple , " he said			0
" ... we were 100 yards from a scuba diving store			0
" the two were in view of other people at @entity102 the day @entity19 disappeared , he said			2
while @entity11 answered specific questions -- at one point saying , " here , i 'll just interview myself " -- he refused to give an entire account of that day , saying , " i 'm not going to sit here and answer something i 've answered repeatedly			2
" but he said he was not hurriedly attempting to escape from @entity3 when he was detained at the airport august 5			2
he said following @entity19 's disappearance , he met with her mother and with a @entity2 @entity113 representative			1
both told him that he should go ahead and return to the @entity2 on his scheduled flight , he said , and police said he was free to go			0
he said he was running through the airport to catch the last flight home , as the airport was closing because of a tropical storm passing north of the island			0
asked about a surveillance video showing him just after @entity19 disappeared , @entity11 disputed that he appeared to be dry and said he was exhausted from swimming back to shore , explaining why he did not appear to be acting more urgently			1
when seeking help , he said he found " nobody there ... i 'm supposed to scream into the air ? " @entity11 was asked about a $ 1.5 million life insurance policy he took out on @entity19 days before they traveled to @entity3			1
he said he purchased travel cancellation insurance on a website and also purchased medical , dental and accident insurance on both him and @entity19			1
because both people were listed on the cancellation policy , the site automatically assigned @entity19 the other insurance , he said			1
" you ca n't unselect anybody			0
" he said he routinely purchases such insurance when traveling			0
" i have children , " he said			0
" i have a house ... i maxed out on everything ... i was selecting it for me and she got the same thing			0
" @entity11 acknowledged he inquired about the policy two days after @entity19 disappeared but said he was told by his then - attorney @entity149 to do so			1
@entity149 told him that he could be billed for helicopters and scuba divers used to search for @entity19 , he said			0
he told " @entity12 " that a travel handbook issued by the @entity154 government advises travelers , in the case of a missing person , to call authorities and then call their insurance company			0
@entity60 , who represented @entity160 earlier this year , suggested in the " @entity12 " interview that @entity149 might have had a financial motive for advising @entity11 to call the insurance company			2
he alleged @entity149 was " seeing dollar signs " and attempted to get @entity11 to sign a retainer agreement giving him one - third of the insurance money			2
reached by telephone in @entity3 on thursday , @entity149 denied that , saying his agreement with @entity11 did not give him one - third of the money			2
@entity11 vehemently denied any involvement in @entity19 's disappearance			1
asked if he would do anything differently if given the chance , he said , " absolutely			0
that 's a silly question ... i would n't have come ( to @entity3 )			2
" but , he added , " you ca n't unring a bell			0
" his lawyer , @entity60 , likewise claimed that critics are looking for a scapegoat in @entity19 's disappearance			1
" everything that they have said in a negative way towards @entity11 is really supposition upon supposition , guess upon guess , " he told @entity62			0
" and just because she has n't been recovered or found , they 're just pointing their finger toward a convenient person , which is @entity11			0
" @entity0 's @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
