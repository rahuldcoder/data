@entity1 @entity0 , @entity2 -- by his own admission , one of the @entity6 's top commanders says his @entity9 " gets all the best stuff " when it comes to state - of - the - art weaponry -- an undeniable reflection of president @entity14 's so - called pivot towards @entity15			1
the flagship of its 7th fleet , the @entity17 @entity0 aircraft carrier boasts a formidable arsenal ; from the latest @entity22 fighter jets , to anti-submarine helicopters and early - warning surveillance aircraft			1
add to this the fleet 's numerous missile destroyers , cruisers and submarines and the statement of intent is clear to see -- @entity0 is serious about its role in the region			1
" it 's a long - term effort for us here , " @entity35 commander vice admiral @entity34 , told @entity3 aboard the giant vessel amid the muffled roar of jet engines from the flight deck directly above			1
" from a policy perspective it 's a shift in balance of not only our resources but our thinking across diplomatic , information , economic and military lines to the @entity49			2
" but i would offer that the 7th @entity35 never left -- we 've been a strong presence here for the past 70 years			1
we 're slowly shifting from a 50/50 mix in the @entity6 to a 40 % @entity60 , 60 % @entity49 mix , " he added , referring to the gradual swing away from traditional areas of operation in the @entity57			2
' most advanced ' weapons " from a military point of view -- my narrow swim lane of responsibility -- we measure our presence in two ways : capability and capacity			2
the capacity is coming -- more numbers over time -- but it 's the capability that 's leading the charge here			0
" i get the preponderance of @entity76 - class warships			2
i get the front - line submarine deployments out here			0
the carrier air wing that operates from the @entity0 is the most advanced in the @entity6 -- and our task force commanders out here get the full support of the ' home office ' in @entity0			2
" in the past few days , these hugely expensive military " assets " have been deployed on a high - profile combat exercise with an armada of ships from the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) off the island of @entity87 , playing out a series of scenarios including the defense of @entity91 and the response to a regional crisis -- timely given @entity95 's increasingly assertive behavior in the region			1
@entity95 looms over @entity99 - @entity91 drills at the same time , @entity95 's own military development has been emphasized by the first deployment of its own aircraft carrier -- the @entity103			1
while most analysts would point to it being decades behind its @entity99 counterparts technologically -- it 's actually a refitted @entity110 - era vessel purchased from the @entity111 in the 1990s -- its very existence is emblematic of @entity114 's growing ambitions			1
diverse security threats yet beyond the waters of the @entity2 , the threats to global stability in recent years have become far more complex and diverse and less likely to be played out on traditional battlegrounds where huge armies or navies face off against each other			1
the threat has become more asymmetric and complex in nature , with unseen enemies striking in less predictable but equally damaging ways -- something @entity34 concedes -- prompting inevitable questions about whether these huge fleets are a worthwhile investment and relevant in this new security landscape			1
" the maritime domain in general has got more complex , with the undersea domain a huge part of that with more sophisticated submarines and the emergence of long - endurance , unmanned or remotely operated vehicles , " he said			0
" you see it just in oceanographic capabilities			0
frankly the way countries globally are using technology in the undersea domain is going to make it a very interesting operational space			0
so the traditional ' hey i 've got a submarine and i get to play here , ' mindset i think is @entity154			0
you 're going to have to bring a lot more capability into that operating space to ensure you stay dominant -- economically as well as militarily			0
" as to the asymmetric threats , the one thing that can not be counted out is the ability of terrorists to use the maritime domain			0
it 's not just in close , such as we saw when the @entity167 was attacked ( in port in @entity169 in 200 ) , all of a sudden it 's threats to commercial shipping and ' choke ' points			0
" major commercial carriers such as @entity175 all have immediate response actions already in place in case the @entity178 is cut off or they ca n't use a port due to a weapon of mass destruction			0
" he said this was a major " economic game changer " when you consider the cost of shutting down major waterways or ports due to terrorist threats			0
" so a lot more thinking has to be done " about how to counter these kind of challenges , he added			0
the nature of the joint exercises with @entity91 forces -- known as @entity200 and involving more than 23 ships and 20,000 servicemen and women -- in part acknowledges this , he said , with the fleet deployed on a variety of " graduate level " missions , from anti-submarine warfare , to defending against hostile incursions against territory			1
awesome power standing on the flight deck of the @entity1 @entity0 , the noise of combat jets as they take off and land just meters away generates an incredible vibration that almost lifts you from your feet -- awesome power that is very difficult not to be impressed by whether you 're a journalist or a foreign power			0
but @entity34 seems anything but a man on the verge of using this immense force in anger -- especially against any perceived @entity95 threat			1
@entity99 ' advising ' airlines to ' comply ' over disputed zone he said the @entity95 's @entity230 was becoming a highly professional organization and improving the way they operate and communicate -- and far from being one prone to making rash moves			1
" i can tell just by our bridge - to - bridge communications that they 're getting better at it			0
they 've got a three - ship surface action group coming back from @entity240			2
they 've been operating in the @entity242 doing counter-piracy operations			0
and they 're operating here in the @entity49 all at the same time			0
two years ago it was a big deal if they were able to conduct an exercise in the @entity249 for a week , now it 's routine			0
" from carrier to ' lily pad ' @entity34 was also keen to expand on the @entity6 's diversity of operations , most notably their recent humanitarian mission in the @entity249 after @entity255 had flattened much of the eastern parts of the country			1
within 48 hours , the carrier and nine other surface vessels had left @entity260 and arrived in the @entity249 to begin carrying our relief operations			2
combat aircraft were deliberately flown off the carrier to make room for more helicopters able to deliver badly needed assistance to areas made inaccessible by the typhoon and the subsequent storm surge			2
@entity34 said in many cases , the @entity273 helicopters were " first responders " able to relay back previously unknown information about local conditions and the extent of the disaster			1
" we transitioned ( the carrier ) into a vertical lift lily pad for the delivery of food and water supplies , " he said			2
critics may point to this being an example of @entity0 adopting a " soft power " approach politically in the region at a time when its influence is being challenged by @entity95 , though there was little doubting the pride expressed by many of the carrier 's highly - trained and motivated crew in performing such a role in the @entity298			1
relief effort boosts @entity99 soft power in @entity15 region but does serving as a deterrent or performing aid missions with hugely expensive weapons of war justify the vast cost of maintaining such an arsenal ? the use of unmanned drones in other theaters illustrates that massed armies with boots on the ground , tanks and artillery are not necessarily the most effective way of dealing with terrorism or insurgencies with a minimal cost in terms of deaths to combatants			1
with military expansion seemingly inextricably linked to economic progress , and the exponential growth of armed forces fueled by territorial disputes in the @entity330 , the large - scale presence of this carrier strike group seems unlikely to change , though the scope of its missions will adapt to meet the increasing diversity of challenges -- both hard and soft			1
@entity114 's choice : control or stability ?			0

@entity99 @entity35 commander says his fleet gets the preponderance of the latest weapons
vice admiral @entity34 says @entity15 region is now the most *important* *strategically*
the carrier strike group has been conducting exercises with @entity91 amid *tension* with @entity95
@entity34 concedes threat to security no longer about vast opposing armies and navies
