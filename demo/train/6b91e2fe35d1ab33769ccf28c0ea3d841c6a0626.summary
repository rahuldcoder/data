@entity0 -- a @entity4 spy found dead at his home in 2010 -- his naked body padlocked inside a large red carrying bag stowed in the bathtub -- was either suffocated or poisoned , but it is unlikely his death will ever be satisfactorily explained , coroner @entity2 said wednesday			1
@entity12 ' death was " unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated , " she ruled			1
he probably entered the bag alive , @entity2 said , reading her ruling to a court around the corner from the home of the world 's most famous fictional detective , @entity18			1
but she was sure an unknown person put the bag containing his body into the bath and probably locked it , she said			1
the case has gripped the @entity4 public for more than a year and a half , since @entity12 , an @entity27 agent known for his mathematical genius and codebreaking talent , was found dead at age 31 in august 2010			1
but after a weeklong inquest at which evidence from hundreds of expert witnesses , security camera images and police interviews was presented , the " most fundamental questions as to how @entity12 died remain unanswered , " @entity2 said wednesday			1
there was " endless speculation but little real evidence , " she said			0
and in unusual criticism of the @entity27 , as @entity27 is formally known , she said a delay in reporting his death and in providing relevant evidence added to the uncertainties about the case			1
some of that evidence came to her only in the last 48 hours of the inquiry , @entity2 said			0
the coroner appeared briefly overcome with emotion as she came to the end of reading her ruling , her voice faltering as she announced her findings			0
the cause of death remains unknown , but experts agreed it was either from suffocation or poisoning , she said			0
" i am therefore satisfied on the balance of probabilities that @entity12 was killed unlawfully , " she concluded			1
among the theories aired by @entity4 media were that @entity12 might have died at the hands of foreign intelligence agents or as a result of a kinky sexual encounter gone wrong , neither of which was supported by the evidence , the coroner said			1
she also cast doubt on suggestions that he was into bondage or transvestism , fueled by the discovery of women 's clothes , wigs and cosmetics in his apartment , saying she thought @entity12 bought them out of an interest in fashion , rather than any sexual motivation			1
expressing her sympathies to his family , @entity2 said the inquest could not bring him back , but she hoped it had at least allowed them to see the evidence out in the open			0
a lawyer for @entity12 ' family said that losing a much - loved son and brother would have been a tragedy in any circumstances but that the nature of @entity12 ' death had made it all the worse			1
" our grief is exacerbated by the failure of his employers at @entity27 to take even the most basic inquiries as to his whereabouts and welfare , which any reasonable employer would have taken , " he said			1
" we are also extremely disappointed at the reluctance and failure of @entity27 to make available relevant information			1
" the family has called for the @entity119 to review the role of the intelligence services in the investigation			1
@entity27 head @entity123 apologized " unreservedly " to @entity12 ' family for the service 's failure to act more swiftly and said measures have been put in place to make sure it does n't happen again			1
the detective leading the police investigation , @entity131 , said new lines of inquiry had resulted from the inquest and would now be " actively pursued			0
" " his naked body was found in the most suspicious of circumstances , " @entity131 said			1
" it is highly likely that a third party was involved in @entity12 's death , and i urge anyone who knew @entity12 or who had contact with him to search their conscience and come forward with any information about what happened that night			1
" inside the court , a picture emerged of a man who had few friends but was very close to his family , highly intelligent and physically fit thanks to his love of cycling			0
a math prodigy who had completed his mathematics degree and master 's by the age of 21 , he was someone who relished a challenge and had received an award for his " world - class " work for the intelligence services			1
summing up the evidence , @entity2 said it was " extremely unlikely , " but not impossible , that @entity12 had worked out a technique to get into the bag -- measuring just 32 inches by 19 inches ( 81 by 48 centimeters ) -- and lock it from the inside			1
but , she said , there was no evidence of footprints or handprints on the walls of the bathroom or the bath itself , as might have been expected if he had done that			0
he was not a risk taker , she said , and that made it unlikely in her view that he would have put himself into the bag even as a personal challenge without making sure he could get out			1
of the four keys belonging to the padlock that secured the bag in which @entity12 was found , one pair was found inside it with him			1
a second pair was found on a key ring in his apartment , @entity2 said			0
there was no sign that evidence had been tampered with , such as traces of bleach			0
there was also no sign of a break - in or robbery in his neat , tidy apartment , she said			0
she described his body as " peaceful " and said there was no indication of a struggle			0
@entity2 also said there were no indications that @entity12 was feeling suicidal			2
however , tests that might have revealed unusual or volatile poisons were ruled out by the decomposition of the body			0
traces of alcohol and a chemical matching the party drug ghb were found , but both can occur naturally as part of the decomposition process , she said			0
@entity4 media have reported that @entity12 ' internet history showed an interest in sex games and bondage , but @entity2 said the codebreaker had made only a handful of visits to bondage sites			2
the coroner said there was no evidence of interest in claustrophilia , a fetish for enclosure in very confined spaces			0
his apartment contained 20,000 pounds ( $ 32,000 ) worth of high - fashion women 's clothing , unworn and packed as purchased , @entity2 said , but she said she found no connection between his death and his interest in fashion and women 's shoes and clothing			0
there also was no indication that his death was connected to his work , she said			0
he had not taken on any high - risk operations , and he worked only in the @entity4			0
there was no evidence of threats arising to him from his work , his employers testified			0
@entity2 was highly critical of @entity12 ' line manager , who did not report that he was missing for about a week after he died august 16			2
she said the inability of the manager to recall certain key bits of evidence concerning the week of @entity12 ' death " is beginning to stretch the bounds of credibility			2
" when questioned , the manager said he assumed @entity12 was absent for a legitimate reason that he had forgotten about , even though he missed several meetings			2
they worked on a small team of four people			0
the manager and other @entity27 employees testified from behind a screen and were identified only as @entity27 , plus a letter			2
@entity12 was finally reported missing by a co-worker august 23 , more than a week after the normally punctilious employee had last shown up at work			2
" i can only speculate as to what effect this had on this investigation , " @entity2 said			0
the decomposition of @entity12 ' body was hastened by the fact it was in a top floor apartment , where the temperature soared in the summer heat			1
the heating was mysteriously also turned on , despite it being a hot august , she said			0
police did not secure the scene until eight or nine days after @entity12 died			2
reports about the " body - in - a - bag spy " describe how two experts spent days trying to figure out whether @entity12 , who was athletic and of medium height , could have contorted himself in such as way as to lock himself into the @entity295 holdall bag , with a key to the padlock inside			1
@entity298 provided to the court shows one of them , @entity302 , folding himself laboriously into an identical bag placed in a bathtub			0
@entity302 , who specializes in rescuing people from confined spaces , told the inquest that he had tried to lock himself into the bag 300 times without success			0
a second expert witness , also of a size and build similar to @entity12 , tried 100 times to re-enact the feat without succeeding			2
neither ruled out definitively the possibility that @entity12 could have somehow done it alone			2
but a small trace of someone else 's dna was found on the bag , helping spawn all kinds of theories about who else might have been there			2
@entity12 was recruited into the intelligence services straight from university , working with @entity327 before @entity27			1
the nature of his work and questions around why his spy agency bosses took so long to raise an alert about his absence have added to the intrigue surrounding his death			0
concerns about national security have been a factor in the 20 - month delay in holding @entity12 ' inquest , and an agency more used to working in the shadows has had an uncomfortably bright light shone into its practices			2
a series of photographs provided by the @entity119 show the tidy , impersonal interior of the spy 's @entity349 home and the small white - tiled bathroom where his body was found			1
a bicycle parked in the hallway is a clue to @entity12 ' passion for cycling			2
a glimpse through a bedroom door shows a bed half - made , clothes lying on it			0
but little else can be gleaned from the images			0
the @entity119 says it is continuing its investigation , particularly in light of the coroner 's findings and the concerns raised by his family			1
but for now , the identity of the unknown person who apparently put the bag holding @entity12 into the bath , exactly how he died and the reason why , remain as much a mystery as ever			1
@entity1 's @entity378 contributed to this report .			0
