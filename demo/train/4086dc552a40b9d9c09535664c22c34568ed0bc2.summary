@entity1 , @entity0 -- if there was a most wanted list for climate change culprits , coal - fired power stations would be number one			2
protesters camping near the site of a proposed coal - fired power station in @entity11 , @entity0			2
burning coal contributes half of the excess carbon dioxide ( @entity14 ) polluting the earth 's atmosphere , a statistic not lost on the hundreds of climate change protesters camping in a grassy field near @entity11 power station in @entity21 , @entity0 this week			1
power company @entity22 is planning to build a new coal - fired power plant on the site , subject to approval by the @entity27 government later this year			2
it 's one of four power stations on a @entity27 government shortlist to trial the country 's first commercial - scale carbon capture and storage ( @entity33 ) technology			1
the @entity36 estimates @entity33 could reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by more than 85 percent			1
protesters at the @entity40 concede that if @entity33 technology was available now and could be fitted to the proposed power station then " maybe we 'd look at it			1
" so what is @entity33 ? @entity33 refers to the process of stripping carbon dioxide from fossil fuels before or after they 're burnt to produce energy			1
the carbon dioxide is then piped back into the earth to a depth of at least 800 meters -- deep enough for the pressure of the earth to keep it in a liquidized form where it stays for thousands , if not millions , of years			1
where is it stored ? depleted oil and gas reservoirs are currently the most practical place to store large volumes of carbon emissions			1
more research would have to be done on other alternatives including deep saline aquifers and deep coal seams			0
@entity69 , professor of geology at the @entity71 says there 's no shortage of potential storage sites			0
" you need the pairing of a porous reservoir overlayed and sealed by a lid of impermeable mudstone or salt rock , which is even better			0
that 's actually very common worldwide			0
" why is n't it being done ? well , it is being done , but only a small scale			2
trials are underway in a number of countries including @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
last week , @entity90 's national science agency , the @entity91 , announced plans to test @entity94 's first post-combustion capture ( @entity96 ) technology at a pilot plant in @entity98			2
the problem is that while the different processes needed to capture and store carbon dioxide have been around for years , no one has brought them together on a large enough scale to cope with the volume of emissions from a typical power plant			1
and then there 's the cost ... professor @entity69 estimates that if a new power plant costs $ 1.5 billion to build , it 'll cost an extra $ 700,000 to fit the capture equipment on the first experimental plants			0
in theory , the extra cost could be added to consumers ' electricity bills but in a competitive power market how many customers would be willing to pay an environmental premium for their electricity and gas ? would you pay more for ' greener ' power ? sound off below " it 's a very immature economic market , " says @entity125 , director of infrastructure at @entity126 , a @entity27 - based company dedicated to the commercialization of carbon storage			1
" the people who might do the industrial scale - up -- the power stations -- have no economic incentive , " he says			2
show me the money aside from government subsidies and investment by companies and private parties , an obvious way to fund the change is through cap and trading schemes			1
@entity145 's @entity144 is the world 's largest for greenhouse gas			1
it works like this : energy companies are given strict limits as to how much carbon dioxide they can emit each year			1
if they exceed the limit or cap , they have to buy more			0
in 2014 , the system is set to change			0
energy companies will have to buy all their emissions permits , so from then on any company that stores some or all of its @entity14 wo n't have to pay			2
if only it was that simple ... " the problem is that the price of maybe € 35 ( $ 54 ) or € 40 ( $ 62 ) per ton of carbon dioxide will not be enough to fund the gap in the extra estimated cost of these new power plants , " explains professor @entity69			1
" there has to be a role of member state governments to bridge that gap			0
in principle that 's possible because the government will receive the income from dirty power plants who will have to buy their emissions			0
what they need to do is take some of that income and give a grant or subsidy to those first experimental power plants			0
" the theory is that as @entity33 techniques become more efficient , the cost of capturing carbon will come down so that from around 2020 it will become cheaper for companies to store carbon than to emit it			1
is it really the way to go ? environmentalists are wary			0
@entity196 says it 's happy for @entity33 technology to be tested as long as it does n't divert attention and funds away from developing renewable energy			1
" we are all accepting that a demonstration of @entity33 is reasonable -- you keep your options open in a situation of urgent global need , " says @entity202 , adding , " @entity33 in our view would be mainly a stop gap or a transition technology while we build solar technologies			1
" so it is dangerous ? in a word , no. geologists are confident the @entity216 wo n't escape from sites approved for storage			0
most of the underground vaults would be out at sea anyway			0
in some instances , the co2 could be stored under residential areas , but strict licensing procedures and the need for constant , rigorous testing should allay fears			0
" one could argue that in an emergency situation even if you keep most of the @entity14 down for one to two hundred years , you 've got yourself out of the danger zone , even if it does begin to leak , " says @entity202			0
professor @entity69 says the environmental cost of not doing it could be catastrophic			0
" the risk of not doing it is that the world continues to put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels whether it 's coal or gas or oil			1
the consequences of not doing it are absolutely catastrophic to ocean ecosystems and to the climate system of the world as we know it			0
