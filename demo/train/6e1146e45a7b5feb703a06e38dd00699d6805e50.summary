@entity1 @entity0 is releasing a new book as the former @entity5 governor prepares for a potential 2016 presidential run , and it covers everything — from reality television to government surveillance ( in a curiously - named chapter " bend over and take it like a prisoner ! " )			1
we read " @entity16 " and rounded up all the info you might not know about the former @entity5 governor : 1			1
he 's got a surprisingly thorough familiarity with pop culture — and very little patience for it			2
@entity0 thinks @entity21 is a bad dancer but @entity22 is a good one			1
he describes @entity21 ' 2013 @entity24 performance as one in which she " contorted her barely - clad , barely legal - age body in a disgustingly pornographic performance that showed just about everything she had — except talent — and focused national attention on a new term , ' twerking , ' which describes a vulgar movement better saved for a stripper pole than prime - time television			1
" @entity22 , however , is " incredibly talented ... has an exceptional set of pipes " and " is a terrific dancer — without the explicit moves best left for the privacy of her bedroom			1
" but he did n't like her dance with husband @entity47 during the @entity48 to their song " @entity50			2
" " @entity47 is a very shrewd businessman , but i wonder : does it occur to him that he is arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object ? " @entity0 wrote of the performance			1
watch : grammys 2014 : performances he 's also not a big fan of @entity62 's style			2
" i 've seen dusty pickup truck windshields that were less see - through than the mesh ' dress ' @entity62 recently ' wore ' on the red carpet at a fashion show , " he noted			2
( @entity69 , which awarded her its 2014 @entity71 — an event that prompted the dress — would probably disagree			0
) and do n't even get him started on reality television , which takes up an entire chapter of his book			1
@entity0 appears to be familiar with @entity78 , @entity79 and the @entity80 — and has problems with all of them			1
later in the book , @entity0 compares a government without checks and balances to " @entity87 on steroids ( and boozed up )			1
" " [ @entity89 ] knew that the sheer power of [ the government ] is an intoxicant and that most of the people who enter government will be like sixteen - year - old boys with keys to the liquor cabinet whose parents are gone for the weekend , " he writes			0
@entity0 also name - drops @entity99 twice			1
his views on gay marriage are more nuanced than you 'd think			0
@entity0 recounts in the book that he got his introduction to the idea of homosexuality from a boy scout troop leader who was molesting members of his troop			1
" to be clear , i am not equating all gay men with pedophiles ; i 'm just relating how this particular person was my introduction to the then - unfathomable concept of same - sex attraction , " he notes			0
describing his outlook as " @entity117 - centered and not man - centered , " @entity0 offers up some questions on homosexuality : " are such variations normal ? which ones ? are there any limits on what is an acceptable attraction ? if so , what is the objective basis for those limits , and who gets to draw that line ? " he later adds : " @entity128 correct when she sings about being ' @entity130 ' ? " and yet , he declares : " the claim that same - sex marriage is destroying society is actually greatly overstated			1
" " @entity134 who themselves abandoned the primacy of lifelong marriage to follow the divorce and remarriage customs of a secular society have as much to answer for as do those who militantly push to redefine marriage , " he adds			0
he has a soft side			0
" i think of myself as a pretty sensitive guy			0
i 'm not callous or cold			0
i 've been known to cry at movies , particularly when a dog dies or a kid gets hurt			0
that 's why i could n't even see @entity147 and had to sit in the theater until everyone left before i exited after sitting through @entity150			0
he 's not particularly pleased with conservative outside groups @entity0 faced opposition from the @entity154 during his 2008 run for president , and apparently still holds a grudge			1
he writes that " groups like @entity154 are basically ' pay for play , ' " and says big donors can write checks to the @entity154 and " it will do the dirty work for you			0
" " it 's a coward 's way to fight , " @entity0 writes			1
@entity0 goes on to compare the battle for conservative purity forged by some of those outside groups to , well , mass - shooters and suicide bombers			1
" i really do n't think [ @entity172 ] @entity172 is the role model the @entity173 wants to emulate			0
we should leave the kind of @entity178 / @entity177 fights for the real jihadists			0
the goal of conservatives should be to build up @entity182 -- not blow up the @entity173			0
he 's got a lotta love for some of his potential 2016 opponents — but disdain for others			2
@entity0 praises and defends a handful of potential 2016 opponents			1
he gushes over @entity192 , calling him " a good man with impeccable integrity in his personal and business life , " praises @entity196 for recruiting businesses to come to @entity198 during his time as governor , and defends his work with former @entity203 gov. @entity202 on @entity204			2
he makes no mention of sens. @entity206 , @entity207 or @entity208 , but does implicitly knock the prospect that they all might run for president while serving in the @entity212			2
during his last run , he says , " i saw others who were sitting members of @entity215 or the @entity212 , who would still receive the paycheck plus all their benefits that i helped pay for , and yet never had to show up for work to get the check ! " he writes			2
" @entity222 work if you can get it ! " 6			0
his verdict on the @entity227 ' parenting skills is still out			0
@entity0 says that he 's " generally admired the parenting instincts of the @entity231 , " but is appalled that they let their daughters listen to @entity47 and @entity22 's " @entity50			1
" " with the @entity232 so concerned about making sure her daughters ' bellies do n't ingest unhealthy food , how can she let their brains ingest obnoxious and toxic mental poison in the form of song lyrics ? " 7			0
he 's allergic to cigarette smoke " i suppose i 'm lucky to be highly allergic to tobacco smoke , because i 've never smoked a single cigarette and never wanted to			0
