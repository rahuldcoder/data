@entity1 is upon us , @entity0 recently placed more people on the path to sainthood , and i got married a few months ago			2
that conjunction of events has sparked a question : i wonder if my wife and i could ever be named saints , as a couple ? i 'm not being egotistical : i am far from saintly ( my wife , @entity14 , is closer )			2
but , in any case , the church instructs @entity17 to aspire to sainthood			1
unfortunately , the odds for us married folk seem terrible			2
of more than 10,000 formally recognized saints , only about 500 have been married , even though many billions of married people have roamed the @entity24 over the centuries			1
and things look really bleak for couples hoping to clear the sanctity hurdle together			0
@entity31 and @entity32 , the parents of @entity30 , attained sanctity as a couple ; so did @entity31 's parents , @entity36 's parents , and a handful of other couples			1
but what about more accessible role models than the @entity43 era titans ? let 's see			2
@entity45 and @entity46 , a simple @entity48 farmer and his wife , have made the cut , recognized for their piety , charity , devotion to each other , and hard work on behalf of their community			0
bravo for them and for the church , because they embody @entity64 's fundamental claim : every person is equally dignified , and sanctity has nothing to do with connections , eye - catching exploits , or prominent church office			1
rather , each life presents equal opportunities for exemplary holiness			0
still , i confess some queasiness about them as role models of conjugal love			0
according to some accounts , @entity45 and @entity46 eventually began living in separate houses in order to abstain from sexual relations			0
and , @entity45 's wife is sometimes known as @entity84 , @entity85 , because her well - preserved head is revered as a relic			1
though enamored of traditional catholic devotions and desirous of sanctity , i would prefer to spare my beloved @entity14 the dubious posthumous honor of having her head set aside as a relic			0
besides , they lived in the 12th century			0
are there more recent role model couples , both canonized saints , to inspire @entity14 and me on our married journey ? i could find none			1
i consulted @entity100 , author of " @entity102 , " and @entity103 , author of " @entity104 , " and they were n't aware of any either			0
really ? my church has been unable to find any couples from the last nine centuries who have together , " practiced heroic virtue and lived in fidelity to @entity113 's grace , " as our catechism defines sanctity ? @entity118 , my parents would seem to fit that definition , and a few of their contemporaries also leap to mind			1
in fact , if an exemplary life of heroic virtue is the criterion , married couple saints must surely abound			1
how many impoverished couples over the centuries , for starters , have remained deeply faithful to each other and to @entity113 , while sacrificing heroically to raise children and support neighbors in war zones , amid inner city chaos , despite religious persecution , or amid chronic famine			0
if that 's not heroic virtue , what is ? some may nitpick my argument , uncover some sainted couple i overlooked , or call attention to two beatified couples now on the sainthood path -- thankfully ! or , they may note that @entity64 considers all those in heaven to be saints ( regardless of whether they have been formally canonized ) , or point out that married couples were surely among martyrs the church remembers in groups like the 120 martyr saints of @entity153 , or the 124 korean martyrs )			1
but the @entity17 , perhaps more than any other institution , knows the power of symbols			2
we worship beneath stained glass windows , amid candlelight and incense			0
and the practice of having recognized so incredibly few married couples by name is a terrible symbol that contradicts what we @entity17 preach about married love			1
after all , pope @entity168 called marriage , " the icon of the relationship between @entity113 and his people			0
" could we not find a few more real - life icons who incarnated @entity168 's beautiful image ? pope @entity0 has thrilled me and the world by his ability to present @entity64 's truths and beauties in new ways			2
i would humbly ask the @entity182 to fix our skewed saint - making process by offering dozens more exemplars of fun , blissful , holy , married love			1
under pope @entity0 ' enlightened leadership , we are trying to become ever more a church that is " poor , and for the poor " : let 's confront the fact that the saint - making process inordinately favors those with connections and resources			1
there are religious orders that staff a full - time position to support the canonization cause of one or more of their deceased ; the @entity202 recently shipped a 20,000 - page dossier to @entity204 to support one religious sister 's sainthood cause			2
such investments of time and effort are unthinkable for most of us who fondly recall holy and loving parents , grandparents or ancestors			0
a change could not be timelier : pope @entity0 has launched the @entity216 , a yearlong reflection on the joys and struggles of married couples and their loved ones			0
the @entity216 's interim report cautions against , " proclaiming a merely theoretical message , " and , as pope @entity224 famously observed , " modern man listens more willingly to witnesses than to teachers			0
" so , @entity0 , with @entity1 upon us , please instruct the @entity230 bureaucrats to elevate more witnesses , flesh - and - blood saintly icons of married love from centuries past ! in the meanwhile , my wife @entity14 and i are loving each other and our married life , and we welcome all saints and sinners , whatever their spiritual or religious tradition , to share their advice for a happy , holy marriage .			1

it 's been nearly 9 centuries since the @entity17 formally canonized a married couple
the saint - making process inordinately favors those with connections and resources , @entity250 argues
