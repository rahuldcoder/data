-- how big a threat do foreign fighters in @entity2 and @entity3 pose to the @entity5 ? it 's a question that has been much on the mind of policymakers and commentators , especially since @entity11 president @entity10 announced the @entity11 was ramping up its military role in the region			1
will such fighters return with dangerous new skills and experience that they are determined to use against their home country ? or is the potential threat by these fighters overhyped ? the answer depends on what the @entity21 decides to do with them			1
so far , jihadi groups in @entity2 have not been sending foreign fighters on attack missions in the @entity5 in any sort of systematic way			1
but if the group decides to " weaponize " its fighters , we will have a much bigger problem on our hands			2
since 2011 , around 3,000 @entity34 have gone to @entity2 , where many have joined the most radical elements of the insurgency			0
and there is no question that some of these individuals will pose a terrorist threat when they return			0
we know this because it has already happened -- @entity2 veterans are suspected of involvement in one successful and at least six unsuccessful alleged attacks in @entity47 and @entity48 over the past year			2
yet there is no reason to expect all -- or even a majority -- of these people to try to attack us in the future			0
during my research , i have found that of all @entity34 who joined conflict zones before 2011 , no more than one in nine moved on to terrorism in the @entity5			2
in fact , this estimate is probably at the high end -- the real historical average may be closer to one in 15 or 20			0
this suggests that the more helpful question is therefore not whether the foreign fighters in @entity2 are a threat , but what proportion of them will be			1
can we not simply assume that somewhere between one in nine or one in 20 of the fighters in @entity2 will become terrorists , and try to plan accordingly ? unfortunately , it 's not that simple because the " blowback rate " -- the proportion of outgoing fighters who later return to attack -- varies significantly between destinations			2
take the conflict in @entity80 , for example , which attracted hundreds of @entity83 foreign fighters in the previous decade , but produced few attacking returnees			1
in contrast , of those who went to @entity87 and @entity88 in the same period , a substantial proportion plotted attacks on their return			0
so , how can we determine whether @entity2 will produce foreign fighters that are more like @entity80 or more like @entity87 and @entity88 in terms of blowback ? it largely depends on whether you have a group in the theater of conflict that strategically targets the @entity5			1
for example , the @entity87 - @entity88 area has a high blowback rate because it is home to the so - called @entity103 , a group whose sole preoccupation is to mount attacks in the @entity5			1
@entity107 excelled at taking foreign fighters who had come to fight with the @entity109 and persuading them to undertake attacks in @entity47 or the @entity11 instead			1
most other jihadi groups , even @entity103 's own affiliates , are not equally invested in this strategy			2
true , they all spout @entity117 rhetoric and may even dabble in @entity119 extremist actions			0
but they invest the bulk of their resources in local operations			0
and so far , that has been true of @entity21 , too			2
of course , if you look for anti-western statements and links to potential international plots , you will find them			0
but these indications actually make up a small proportion of the group 's overall ideological production and military operations			0
the fact is that there is little to suggest that @entity21 has had a sustained and centrally directed global operations program			1
this is one of the reasons why the blowback rate from @entity2 has so far been low , several plots notwithstanding			0
six plots involving a total of , say , 10 or 20 @entity2 veterans make for a blowback rate of one in 150 or one in 300			0
yes , it is still early in the conflict , and several plots may have gone unreported			0
but @entity2 is still looking like a low blowback foreign fighter destination			0
there is , however , the question of whether @entity83 intervention in @entity3 and @entity2 will cause @entity21 to go global			1
certainly , the group has taken a more anti-western posture over the past few months			0
it has repeatedly threatened to attack the @entity11 , and it has beheaded @entity11 hostages in @entity2			0
in a noteworthy statement , for example , @entity21 spokesman @entity159 recently called on supporters worldwide to attack members of the coalition in any way possible			2
so we should not be surprised if @entity21 embarks on a limited but sustained external operations effort , along the lines of @entity169 in @entity170 , which combines a primarily local agenda with a small global side operation			1
ultimately , though , @entity21 is unlikely to go all in on global operations the way @entity103 has			1
the organization is not designed for that , and such a strategy is not compatible with its state - building ambitions			0
besides , @entity21 ' threats have so far differed in tone from those of @entity103			1
where the latter says , in effect , that " we 're coming at you regardless , " @entity21 has basically been saying , " we 'll come at you if you attack us			2
" it 's a somewhat more reluctant declaration of war			0
none of this is to suggest that some foreign fighters in @entity2 wo n't come back and do bad things regardless of what @entity21 ' leaders choose to do -- they undoubtedly will			1
and it is also important to remember one more thing , namely that although the early signs suggest that the threat from foreign fighters returning is low , the potential for attacks is still there			1
indeed , if @entity21 starts to " weaponize " its @entity83 recruits in a strategic way , then the foreign fighter threat will take on a more significant -- and more deadly -- complexion than it has so far .			1

likelihood of foreign fighters planning attacks in @entity5 varies by where they were , *writer* says
@entity21 less *interested* in planning attacks *overseas* than @entity103 , @entity214 says
@entity21 is unlikely to go all in on global operations the way @entity103 has , he says
