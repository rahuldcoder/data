interactive : track the flights here travelers passing through @entity2 can expect delays or disruption to their flights for hours to come			1
@entity27 said the @entity4 systems were " now working and stable , " but about 50 flights had been canceled by 5:30 p.m. gmt ( 12:30 p.m. et ) , with the number expected to rise over the evening and into saturday			1
" the earlier problem will cause delays and cancellations to flights for the rest of the day and is likely to have a knock - on effect on some services tomorrow because aircraft and crew will now be out of position , " @entity27 said in a statement			1
" passengers due to depart today and tomorrow should check the status of their flight with their airline before traveling to @entity27			1
we are very sorry for the disruption to passengers ' journeys			2
" extra staff will be on duty to help passengers , it said			0
@entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 airports , which all serve @entity2 , also warned of delays			1
the disruption caused big problems inside @entity27			1
hundreds of unclaimed bags sat beside carousels inside @entity64 's baggage claim			2
a baggage handler told @entity66 some people grew tired of waiting and left without collecting their bags			0
carousels were not assigned for some incoming flights			2
a spokesman for budget airline @entity71 , @entity72 , told @entity66 that flights were expected to resume with delays but that cancellations were not expected			1
' @entity76 ' of one error @entity72 slammed @entity4 over the problem , saying it was " unacceptable " that its system had " dropped for the second time in 12 months , particularly on a busy friday in the run - up to @entity80			0
" @entity82 , a spokesman for @entity4 , said , " we think there is problem with the flight data system although not exactly sure at this time			2
" he told @entity66 its systems were not hacked and that idea " has been ruled out completely			1
" aviation security expert @entity89 told @entity66 the incident had exposed a weakness in the air traffic system , a problem that needs to be addressed urgently			1
" we 're going to have a major digital forensic effort here i think , driven by @entity5 authorities -- maybe with assistance from international aviation authorities -- to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible , " he said			0
" the disconcerting aspect here is the humongous impact of what appears to be one technical error			0
it does n't appear like a whole group of people made a mistake or a whole group of systems all had an error at the same time , so it tells us somewhere in how the system is configured now there are vulnerabilities we did not know about and apparently have not been accounted for in terms of control measures			0
" @entity117 offered refunds or the chance to rebook to any of its passengers not wishing to travel friday in light of the problems			0
" we anticipate disruption to both departing and arriving flights but will do all we can to minimize any impact , " it said in a statement			2
international consequences it 's not just @entity5 travelers who will be affected by the glitch			2
" all flights that are supposed to fly @entity2 from @entity134 are delayed , " a representative for @entity137 @entity134 airport told @entity66			1
" flights from @entity139 will be landing at @entity134 instead of @entity2			1
" @entity140 , a spokeswoman for @entity141 , said none of its inbound flights friday was affected but that four outbound flights were being held at the gate until the issue was resolved			0
a spokesman for @entity149 advised passengers bound for @entity2 on friday to check the status of their flights before traveling			1
the @entity154 air traffic control network , @entity155 , earlier said no flights would be accepted in or out of @entity2 until 7 p.m. ( 2 p.m. et. ) the issue affected the air traffic control center in @entity159 , which controls all air traffic routes in southern @entity161 and @entity162 , up to approximately @entity163			1
a second air traffic control center at @entity165 in @entity166 takes over air routes from there			1
it was not affected , @entity4 said			0
a problem with many moving parts @entity66 's @entity170 said more than 80 airlines fly into and out of @entity27 , with some 200,000 people passing through the airport daily			1
" the system is working fine , but it 's the aircraft that are in the wrong place -- it 's the aircraft that are delayed , " he said friday evening			0
" there 's a number of planes that have been diverted to other places			0
they still have to get here -- to @entity2			2
" @entity89 , the aviation security expert , said the resulting effects would be significant			0
he said they include " the parking of the aircraft , refueling , servicing of the aircraft , the security guarding and checking of the aircraft , the handling of the passengers at different airports where they 're not really planning on that kind of capacity for the coming night -- perhaps this is happening overseas as well -- flights that were en route to the @entity5 now diverting to other places			0
" hopefully this will not affect some of the biggest , busiest flights			0
think about you piloting an @entity204 en route to @entity2 and you needing to divert , and having to fit that into a schedule of another airport			2
so these are some major challenges throughout the system that we 're hoping and we 're assuming authorities -- not just in the @entity5 but elsewhere as well -- are ready to handle now			0
