-- " this here ai n't no protest song or anything like that , cause i do n't write no protest songs			1
" -- @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , april 1962 @entity8 and @entity11 perform at a civil rights rally in @entity13 in 1963 it was in typically oblique fashion that @entity8 launched " @entity17 " on the world			2
a song takes on a life of its own once it has left a musician 's private domain and even if he did n't see it as a protest song , it has certainly been interpreted as one by its listeners			1
it has become one of the most recognized political songs of popular culture and its release on the 1963 album " @entity32 " arguably marks the pinnacle of the protest song as a cultural force			1
today @entity8 really does n't write protest songs and hardly , it would seem , does anyone else			1
but is this because there is a dearth of politically - motivated singers , or has the public simply lost its appetite for protest ? " there was a particular genre of songwriting which @entity8 represented in the sixties and seventies which does n't continue in quite the same way , " says professor @entity45 , head of @entity46 at the @entity47 and author of " @entity49			1
" " if the protest song is defined by the lone voice with a guitar , then it probably has declined , even though people like @entity61 and so forth strive to keep it alive			1
" in his brief sojourn as leader of the counterculture 's political awakening , @entity8 was following in a tradition for protest in folk music that had existed for centuries			2
folk practitioners such as @entity72 and @entity73 used their music in the 1940s and 1950s to support the burgeoning labor movement and to speak out against senator @entity78 's purge against " un-american " behavior			0
but the roots of protest music can be traced back to as early as the 14th century in @entity83 where the " @entity86 " was taken up as the rallying call for the @entity85			1
the protest song crossed the @entity88 and many were written during the @entity90			1
nor did the protest song die when @entity8 eschewed overtly political song - writing			1
when @entity8 stepped across the electric fence , the protest song made the leap with him			1
suddenly , in a world where the counter culture was brushing the brim of mainstream culture , even rock n ' roll , which hitherto had limited itself to the subjects of love , sex , cars and dancing , was overflowing with political messages ; @entity105 played a version of the " @entity107 " which was interpreted by many as an @entity110 statement			0
@entity111 wrote " @entity117 " after four students were killed by members of the @entity114 at an anti-war demonstration at @entity116			0
in soul music , artists such as @entity120 with " @entity121 " and @entity122 with his album " what 's going on " became spokespersons for the civil rights movement of the late 1960s			2
this carried over into the 1980s with hip hop acts such as @entity129 protesting against the endemic racism and poverty faced by the black community in @entity133			1
meanwhile in the @entity135 , the punk movement took on the mantle of political protest from its folk and rock forebears , with groups such as @entity141 criticizing racial disharmony in @entity135 society			2
but as the new century approached it seems as though the appetite for using music as a tool for protest diminished			2
@entity149 can be drawn between the political climate of the 1960s and today : a fear of communism has been supplanted by a fear of terrorism and even @entity156 himself has pointed out similarities between the @entity159 and the conflict in @entity161			0
it would seem like a ripe time for the protest song to make a comeback			1
while the @entity161 war has seen some of the 1960s ' stalwarts re-emerge , with @entity170 calling for @entity156 to be impeached and @entity171 releasing an album of thirteen covers of protest songs by @entity73 , none of yesterday 's stars wield the same influence with today 's young as they did when they were at their peek			1
some mainstream pop stars have made stabs at political songs			0
in 2006 @entity183 released the single " dear mr president , " an open letter to @entity156 criticizing some of his policies , on her album " i 'm not dead "			0
but the song was only released as a single in @entity190 and @entity191 , leaving her open to criticism that releasing an anti-us foreign policy song in @entity190 , where opinion had already largely turned against the wars in @entity196 and @entity161 , was virtually riskless			0
but it seems musicians are still flexing their muscles in the political sphere , only the protest comes dressed in different clothes , with a new hard - nosed approach that matches the nous of politicians			2
rock stars are no longer part of the counter culture			0
they are immensely wealthy members of the establishment , with the weight of large corporations behind them , and they are using their insider influence to lobby on behalf of their cause			0
the focus has shifted to fighting global poverty and climate change , with musical events such as @entity220 and @entity221 , and while they may not be singing songs of protest , pop stars are using their presence at these global events to push for change			2
" the idea that we should listen to people like @entity231 and @entity232 on @entity233 is in a part a product of the thought that musicians were not merely crafters of nice tunes but were actually serious commentators on our world , " says @entity45			0
" the kind of people who might have sat on the outside looking in are now so establishment , they 're acting as pressure groups within the system			0
" in fact , @entity232 has pointedly lambasted the protest song , claiming it has little or no power to effect change			1
he told @entity254 magazine that the protest rock served out by the @entity141 , who headlined the 1978 @entity258 festival at @entity259 in @entity260 was " a laughable farce " and that " the rhetoric of pop revolution was too easy			0
" it was this same line of thinking that led him to dismiss the idea that @entity233 bands should play at @entity220 because they were @entity233 : they should only appear if they were popular , he argued , as it was the ability to attract large crowds who would rally behind the push to cancel world debt that would persuade public opinion wary @entity275 leaders to bend from their course			0
while the live 8 concerts were met with cynicism by some - " for many of the people listed in this line - up ... it 's a chance to get on world - wide television , sell a load of albums and feel very pleased with yourself at the end of the day , " said @entity281 in the @entity135 's independent newspaper - they succeeded in bringing on board the world 's media and in exerting pressure which led to the cancelling of debt for the world 's poorest countries and $ 50 billion in aid promised			2
but according to a report by @entity303 ( debt , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity233 ) , the @entity275 have since " shuffled at half - pace on aid , and fell backwards on trade "			0
the legacy of @entity220 will determine which relationship between music and politics is the most effective			0
