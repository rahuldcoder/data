-- the last couple of weeks have been busy ones for news about @entity4			0
" @entity6 " movie hit theaters , ceo @entity8 donated $ 100 million on @entity9 and , if rumors are correct , the world 's biggest social - networking site will be partnering with online phone service @entity13 to help you chat with your @entity4 friends through the site			1
according to @entity19 's @entity18 , @entity4 and @entity13 are about to announce a partnership that includes " integration of @entity22 , voice chat and @entity24			2
" it 's not clear exactly what this deal would entail , but possibilities include @entity29 over a browser to cell phones , and video chat among @entity4 friends			1
the question is : do people actually want to interact with their @entity4 friends on a more intimate level ? according to @entity4 , the average user has 130 friends			0
but these connections likely include your ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends , casual acquaintances and maybe even that weird person who sat behind you in seventh - grade biology -- in other words , not necessarily people you 'll want to chat with on the phone			0
@entity13 already has a huge following , but a connection to a 500 - million - member social network would n't hurt			1
@entity13 's appeal overseas also would make @entity4 much more attractive abroad			2
but to truly succeed , the partnership will have to go beyond voice chat , because people already can use @entity13 to talk to people they really care about .			0
