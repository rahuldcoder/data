-- a noted tech journalist and early adopter of @entity5 's @entity4 headset is declaring the technology " doomed , " at least for 2014			1
there 's a tongue - in - cheek nature to @entity10 's pronouncement , which he shared with the 4.7 million people who follow him on @entity12			1
his strong language , he said , was a send - up of the tech press 's sometimes over-the - top approach to news			1
but @entity10 , who got his @entity19 in april on the second day the devices became available to some journalists and early testers , predicts the connected eyewear will flop with consumers when it goes on sale to the general public , presumably this year			1
@entity10 said he thinks the price will be too high and there wo n't be enough apps or useful functions to make the wearable tech worth the cost			1
he has a sunnier view of @entity4 's long - term prospects , though			1
" by 2020 i 'm quite convinced this will be a big deal and there will be lots of competitors by then , " he wrote			2
" so , if you make it about 2020 , then it is n't doomed			2
if it 's about beating the @entity44 in 2014 ? yes , totally doomed			0
" @entity44 has not rolled out a smartwatch yet but is widely rumored to be doing so soon , marking the tech giant 's entree into the emerging wearable - tech field			2
@entity5 did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment for this article			0
@entity4 is a headset with a camera and small screen situated above the wearer 's right eye			1
the wearer can access the @entity58 and snap images and video by using voice commands			0
a blogger and author , @entity10 works as a new - tech " evangelist " for it company @entity65			1
but his influence in the tech community is broader and his writing helps shape opinion in some quarters			0
@entity10 has 374,000 followers on @entity72 and has been one of the most visible @entity4 users			1
a photo of him wearing the headset in the shower went viral last year			0
@entity10 noted that @entity4 , which has sold for $ 1,500 to a limited number of beta testers , is likely to be released at a cost of more than $ 500			1
he says that 's too much for the public at large			0
" @entity84 is gon na matter a lot			2
but i 'm hearing they wo n't be able to get under $ 500 in 2014 , so that means it 's doomed			1
in 2014 , " @entity10 wrote			2
" when they get under $ 300 and have another revision or two ? that 's when the market really will show up			0
" he said the headset will need to be custom - fitted to its wearer , and that customers will need to receive an hour or two of training before using it -- which will inflate its price			0
@entity10 also believes that battery life , at least on the current glass models , wo n't be enough for some people			1
he said a lack of apps could also hurt			1
" that will start getting fixed after a few months of release , but early users are gon na continually ask ' where 's the @entity109 app ? " ' or ' where 's the @entity112 app ? ' or ' why does the @entity114 app suck ? ' he wrote			0
@entity10 criticized the lack of a quality @entity114 app in particular			1
" sorry @entity5 , but @entity12 still is n't used by my family , friends , or those i speak with ... , " he wrote			0
" @entity12 is n't nearly as ubiquitous or as nice , truth be told , particularly for mobile users			0
this lack of @entity114 support is the # 1 thing that pisses me off about @entity4			1
" all of that said , @entity10 holds out hope			2
he said he still loves his glass and that it 's unfair to judge a test version of the still - new device as if it 's a finished product			0
" so , what would i do if i were @entity5 ? reset expectations , " he wrote			0
" say ' this is really a product for 2020 that we 're gon na build with you			0
' first release is in 2014 , but let 's be honest , if it 's $ 600 and dorky looking , it 'll be doomed -- as long as expectations are so high			0
" while still in limited release , @entity4 has already stirred up some controversy			2
some restaurants and other businesses have banned @entity4 over concerns about the headset 's ability to take photos and record video			1
and users have already been ticketed for wearing them while driving , as lawmakers in several states consider laws to ban them behind the wheel			0
and then there 's their appearance			0
@entity4 's part - futuristic , part - dorky look has been mocked in such spots as the blog , @entity161 » ¿			2

top tech blogger says @entity4 wo n't do well when it hits the market
@entity10 has used glass since april 2013
@entity84 , lack of apps likely will hurt its early sales , he says
but by 2020 , he thinks the headset will be a hit
