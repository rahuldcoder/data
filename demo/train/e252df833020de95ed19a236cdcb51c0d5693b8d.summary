-- with its post-apocalyptic setting , @entity3 in the role of endearing villain , and @entity6 as an executive producer , creator @entity9 's " revolution " is a surefire hit -- on paper			1
in fact , @entity12 ordered a full season of " revolution , " which also stars @entity16 , after airing just three episodes , which is the same amount of time it took the network to axe " @entity22 " last year			1
yet , it seems viewers become more disillusioned with the freshman drama each week			2
still , with its mid-season finale airing tonight , " revolution " has garnered competitive ratings , and helped @entity12 win november sweeps for the first time in nine years			1
on tuesday , @entity0 commenter @entity31 wrote , " i 've watched every episode , but i 'm ready to give up " on the show , which takes place 15 years after a global blackout causes the government to collapse and prompts militias to take over			1
" the story moves at a snail 's pace , " @entity31 continued			0
" even if we buy the science behind the show 's premise , the individual episodes are so infuriating with their slow pace and stupid and unbelievable character interaction that i 'm not watching anymore			1
" as with many new shows , ratings for " revolution " have declined since its september 17 premiere drew 11.7 million viewers and a 4.1 rating among adults 18 to 49			1
of late , ratings leveled off at about 7 million viewers and a 2.6 rating			1
despite @entity12 's apparent confidence , " revolution " will soon embark on a three - month hiatus , to return on march 25 , so it can continue benefiting from its current lead - in show , " @entity63			1
" as @entity66 's @entity65 notes , a long hiatus " could be deadly			0
there are a ton of new shows coming out in january that could step in and take that audience away			0
" but it 's likely that if " revolution " does n't succeed during the second half of its first season , it wo n't be because of winter break			1
" a lot of people wanted to see how the world reacted when the power went out , " @entity65 said			0
" they were disappointed that , basically , the story jumped forward and they did n't get to see the aftermath			0
" sure the show revisits these moments in flashbacks , but viewers " do n't want to derail the storyline in the current time to keep going back , " @entity65 said			2
" people have been burned with shows like ' lost ' and ' heroes			0
' they get invested in them , and seasons later they still do n't have answers to the questions they tuned in for , so they get a little disillusioned and give up			0
that might be happening earlier than usual ( with ' revolution ' )			2
" as @entity0 commenter @entity106 wrote on wednesday , " i ca n't believe ' revolution ' continues to be a success			2
i was really interested in it at first but i think it has really lost steam			0
" apart from pace , it 's the shows characters that seem to anger viewers			0
though fans appear to enjoy @entity16 as protagonist @entity104 and @entity116 ( " @entity117 " ) as @entity118 of the @entity104 , @entity119 in the driver 's seat as @entity104 has n't been as well received			1
in october , the @entity123 's @entity122 wrote , " if @entity126 has any strengths as an actress ( and that 's not at all apparent ) , the show 's writers have n't learned to write to them , and every week , despite ' @entity104 's ' general efficiency and the skills of its other cast members , there 's a clunky @entity104 moment that makes me want to delete the show 's @entity135 from my dvr			0
" @entity0 commenter @entity31 agrees : " @entity104 is such an annoying , whiny , stupid character			0
it 's not all the fault of the actor			0
the writers give her such dumb dialogue			0
@entity146 ( @entity147 ) is a much more interesting character , but the entire season is spent trying to rescue him ( from the militia )			2
" while other supporting characters like @entity158 's @entity104 and @entity159 as @entity160 have garnered more positive feedback , @entity164 editor - at - large @entity162 reminded viewers not to get too attached in an october recap : " @entity12 's ' revolution , ' in its fourth outing , busted out one of the oldest tricks in the book : inviting us to care , more than we had done to date , about a major - ish character , before killing that person off			1
" " i believe that people love exploring ' what if ? ' scenarios , and the one at the heart of ' revolution ' is compelling , especially in an era where so many of us are ' wired in ' and immersed in a digital age , " @entity162 told @entity0 via e-mail			2
" if anything ( detracts ) from the ' revolution ' experience -- and mind you , this is a show whose producers vetted with a physicist the very foundation of the global blackout -- it is other ' leaps ' and lapses in continuity , " he continued , " such as the seemingly fresh - from - @entity194 wardrobe and a surprising dearth of bicycles			1

" revolution " has helped @entity12 win november sweeps for the first time in nine years
@entity12 ordered a full season of the @entity16 - starrer after airing just three episodes
ratings for " revolution " have declined since it premiered in september
