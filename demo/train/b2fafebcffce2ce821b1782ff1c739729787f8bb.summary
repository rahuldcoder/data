-- going against his personal views , @entity2 's governor wo n't challenge a federal judge 's ruling striking his state 's same - sex marriage ban , paving the way for gay and lesbian couples to marry there			1
gov. @entity11 announced his decision in a statement wednesday , a day after @entity15 district judge @entity14 became the latest federal judge to declare a state 's restriction of marriage to one man and one woman to be unconstitutional			1
@entity2 officials will " follow ... the provisions of @entity25 ' order with respect for all parties , " the governor said			0
state attorney general @entity29 has also announced that she will not defend @entity2 's same - sex marriage ban because of what she believes is " the unconstitutionality of this law			1
" that means that while other entities could file appeals of their own , they are unlikely to have legal standing and therefore affect what happens in @entity2			0
@entity11 -- a @entity41 who just won his party 's primary in pursuit of a re-election bid and , as he points out , a @entity40 -- said in his statement wednesday that he still personally believes " that marriage is between one man and one woman			1
" his decision not to stand by that belief in court comes after " a judgment as to the likelihood of a successful appeal			2
" " given the high legal threshold set forth by @entity25 in this case , the case is extremely unlikely to succeed on appeal , " @entity11 said			2
" therefore , after review of the opinion and on the advice of my @entity62 legal team , i have decided not appeal			0
" state - by - state : developments on same - sex marriage @entity66 , president of the @entity67 , slammed @entity11 for opting " to defend himself and his political aspirations " rather than the traditional definition of marriage			1
" governor @entity11 is abandoning marriage with this choice , " @entity66 said on his organization 's blog			1
" he is also turning his back on the people of @entity2 and selling out his principles precisely when it is most necessary that he stand by them ! " yet others applauded @entity11 's decision			2
those supportive voices include @entity84 , a senior adviser with the @entity85 , a pac dedicated to making a conservative case for " the cause of freedom for gay and lesbian @entity15			0
" @entity84 said @entity11 " did the right thing today , preventing a prolonged , divisive debate and providing much needed certainty for loving @entity2 families			0
" " like @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 before him , governor @entity11 recognizes there are thoughtful people with sincerely held beliefs on both sides of this issue and his decision allows his state to move forward and focus on the priorities citizens are concerned most about , " @entity84 added			2
@entity25 ' decision was the latest in a wave of rulings against state prohibitions on same - sex marriage in the 11 months since the @entity15 @entity110 struck down part of the federal @entity112			1
that 5 - 4 opinion , written by justice @entity114 , did not directly affect individual states ' laws restricting marriage based on sexual orientation			0
but many federal judges have cited his decision on @entity121 in their judgments , as well as the argument that same - sex marriage bans violate the 14th amendment of the @entity15 @entity126			1
most of these court rulings have been stayed -- meaning that , for now , marriage prohibitions remain in place -- until appeals courts , and possibly the @entity110 , weigh in			0
already , judges in the @entity133 out of @entity134 and 4th circuit out of @entity136 , @entity137 , have heard appeals			0
all this movement in legal circles comes amid a significant shift in public opinion in recent years			0
several states moved to allow gay and lesbian marriages last year on their own volition			0
a @entity147 survey released wednesday showed that 55 % of respondents support laws granting same - sex couples equal rights to traditional marriages , the highest such number since @entity147 began polling on this question in 1996			2
support for same - sex marriage increases federal judge strikes down @entity159 's ban			1

new : a conservative leader *accuses* gov. @entity11 of " abandoning marriage "
@entity11 says he believes marriage should be between one man , one woman
still , he decides against fighting a decision striking state 's same - sex marriage ban
" the case is extremely unlikely to succeed on appeal , " @entity11 says
