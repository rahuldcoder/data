-- on @entity4 , husband and wife @entity1 and @entity3 will be wearing orange and blue and cheering their team in the @entity7 -- from opposite sides of the stadium			1
the games features the @entity11 facing off against the @entity12 , and both schools happen to share an orange and blue color scheme			2
@entity3 went to @entity11 , and @entity1 is a @entity16 alum			2
the two first met in neutral territory , @entity18 , when they both found themselves at a place known as the " @entity22 " to watch a game			2
@entity3 went by choice , but @entity1 was tagging along with a friend			2
usually , this difference does n't turn @entity3 and @entity1 from couple to rivals			1
the two football teams have played one another only two previous times -- in 1997 and 1998			2
but for two passionate football fans that are true to their schools , the bowl is turning theirs into a house divided			1
with bowl season in full swing , there will definitely be friends and families divided by the @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 bowls and ultimately the @entity46			1
no rivalry is worth starting a long - standing feud in the family , but it 's fun to get into the spirit of collegiate loyalties			1
because of the holidays and his dad 's 60th birthday , @entity1 's family is coming to town for the game			1
all of @entity1 's siblings also went to @entity16 , so they bought tickets for the whole family			1
@entity3 responded in kind by buying tickets so she can sit with her family on the @entity11 side of the stadium			1
" neither of us are very good losers , " she said			2
" and that can make people pretty miserable			0
" no need for tensions and loyalties to clash on the father - in - law 's birthday			1
if @entity77 wins , her husband will bring it up " forever			0
" " if @entity11 wins , i 'll be a little mean that night , but @entity11 really should beat them , " she said			0
" if they do n't , i 'll be embarrassed			0
" get the latest college football news with @entity82 @entity83 and her husband , @entity84 , have also had some " jabbing back and forth			0
" as it happens , @entity83 and @entity3 are friends , and both of them happened to marry men who went to the @entity12			0
but the biggest difference is @entity83 's husband loves @entity11 , and the two always watch @entity11 games together			0
they may not be able to watch the bowl game , however , because the couple will be vacationing in @entity95			1
when they found out the two schools would play one another in the bowl , they had already booked their trip			1
@entity83 said there was no way they would change their tickets for a bowl game			1
but if they did , the couple would wear orange and blue , sit together , and her husband would probably bring a " back - up @entity11 hat , " just in case			1
while @entity83 does n't have to worry about a football rivalry in her marriage , she is familiar with a house divided by an even deeper challenge : @entity11 and the @entity117			0
@entity83 's family enjoys the excitement of a good , long - standing rivalry , but never lets it go too far			1
growing up in @entity123 , her family watched all of the ' @entity125			1
but when @entity83 was accepted to @entity11 , things began to change			0
her brothers followed suit , and soon @entity83 , her father and her siblings were on the orange and blue side of the divide , while her mother and grandfather swore by the @entity123			2
in the @entity136 , rivalries divide houses and run deep in family blood			1
@entity11 and @entity123 play each other every year in the @entity140 -- the week of @entity141			0
so each year , @entity83 's mother goes the @entity123 alumni bar to watch the game , while @entity83 , her brothers and father go to the @entity11 alumni bar			0
during halftime , whoever is losing has to visit the other bar and " eat it " for a little while			0
" it may be @entity141 , but i 'm going to talk back to my mom ! " @entity83 said , laughing			0
family will still be family , tensions will ease after the @entity140 , and the jokes and jabbing will be swapped in good fun			2
because @entity77 and @entity11 have conflicting game times during the regular season , @entity3 and @entity1 managed to find a bar near their home in @entity164 that would broadcast both			2
as @entity3 watched @entity11 lose to the @entity166 this year , @entity1 was enjoying a game of @entity16 vs. @entity168			0
he invited her to come watch his game because @entity77 was faring well			0
despite @entity11 's possible defeat , @entity3 let him know that she " did n't care about his stupid game			0
" if bowl season , or a good old - fashioned conference rivalry , is attempting to divide your house , @entity3 has some tips for how " not to kill each other			1
" " just have fun with it , and maybe go to separate places to watch the game if possible			0
but i 'll tell you this , i would n't watch any games with him if he went to @entity123			0

collegiate bowl season can divide couples because of their school loyalties
one couple will sit on opposite sides of the stadium for the @entity7
@entity197 rivalries also cause family *members* to clash
