if something can connect to a network , it can be hacked			1
computers and phones are still popular targets , but increasingly so are cars , home security systems , tvs and even oil refineries			1
that was the message at this year 's @entity12 and @entity13 computer security conferences , which took place last week in @entity15			1
the annual conferences draw a mix of computer researchers and hackers who present the latest bugs and vulnerabilities they 've discovered			1
it 's a combination of public service , business and sport			2
these are some of the more popular targets covered at this year 's conferences			0
by drawing attention to them , the " white - hat " hackers hope to encourage greater security from the various manufacturers and industries , and more vigilance from consumers			1
typically , the presenters inform manufacturers of bugs ahead of their talks so the companies can fix the issues before they are exploited by criminals			0
remote - controlled cars someone hacking your computer can be an inconvenience			0
someone hacking your car can be deadly			1
a pair of presentations on hacking cars kicked off the @entity13 conference on friday			0
@entity59 hacker @entity58 outlined the security issues fully autonomous cars will face and said car - hacking is inevitable			1
autonomous vehicles like cars and drones are essentially robots , and they rely on sensors to operate			0
he said a hacker could theoretically take complete control of a car over wireless networks or trick its various sensors into feeding a motorist false information about location , speed and the proximity of other cars or objects			1
fully driverless cars are still a few years away , but computerized systems are common in vehicles on the road today			0
electronic control units can control a range of car functions , including braking , accelerating and steering			1
they manage security features , in - car displays and even seat belts			1
researchers @entity93 and @entity94 , funded by a grant from the @entity98 military 's @entity96 , looked into what kind of damage hackers could do to a car by taking control of a @entity103 and a @entity104			1
to access the systems , they had to physically connect a computer to the cars through a diagnostics port			0
they wrote custom software that let them hijack the cars ' systems			0
once in control , they disabled brakes , changed the display to show incorrect speed or gas levels , and messed with the steering and seat belts			0
they were able to kill the engine and toy with with less consequential features like the car 's horn and lights			1
@entity103 played down the wired demonstration and said it is focusing on security measures to prevent wireless attacks			1
compromising smartphones attacks on personal computers used to be the bread and butter of cybercriminals , spawning a lucrative industry of black - market malware and the anti-virus programs that fight them			1
the next big target is smartphones			1
mobile devices are not impervious to attacks , even though walled - off app stores have kept much of the malware at bay			1
@entity149 demonstrated how a piece of malware could turn an @entity153 smartphone into a " spy phone " that remotely monitors its owner , sending information on the location , communications and content , like photos , back to a third party			1
the hack is n't new , but @entity149 managed to inject the malicious code into popular apps like " @entity165			0
" once it was installed , the user would have no idea that their phone was acting as a remote surveillance device			1
@entity181 " femtocells " -- small boxes used to extend cell service -- were hacked by security researchers at @entity173 to intercept calls and any other data sent over cellular networks like texts , images and browsing history			1
the wireless carrier issued a fix for all its femtocells , but researchers say other networks could still have the same issue			1
with $ 45 in hardware , researchers @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 turned an innocent - looking @entity196 charger into a tool for gathering information such as passcodes , e-mails and other communications , and location data directly from the smartphone			1
@entity204 thanked the researchers and said it is deploying a fix for the bug in its @entity209 software update , which comes out this year			1
the too - smart home thanks to cheap , low - power sensors , anything in your house can become a " smart " device , helpfully connecting to the internet so you can control it from a computer or smartphone			1
smart home security devices have the potential to cause the most damage if hacked , and two separate demonstrations showed how to break in by opening " smart " front - door locks			1
another unsettling trend at the conferences was spying on unwitting people through their own cameras			1
home security cameras could be disabled by someone who wanted to break in , or they could be turned into remote surveillance devices			1
one researcher showed how she easily took over the camera stream on a child 's toy from a computer			2
researchers @entity240 and @entity241 found bugs in the 2012 model of the @entity244 that allowed them to turn on and watch video from the set 's camera			2
@entity244 said it had released a software update to fix the issue			0
( many security experts suggest placing a piece of tape over any cameras you do n't want surreptitiously watching you , just to be safe			1
) hackers get personal even in the wake of this year 's @entity259 revelations , a homemade surveillance device that sniffs out pieces of data from your various computing devices , even when they 're not online , is disturbing			0
@entity266 , who runs a security firm and is finishing a law degree , has created such a device , dubbed @entity270 ( @entity271 stands for @entity272 ; " @entity274 " is self - explanatory )			2
the device cost $ 57 to make and consists of a @entity277 computer , a usb hub , two @entity280 connections , an sd card and usb power inside an nondescript black case			0
computers and phones act as tracking devices and leak information constantly , according to @entity266			2
when plugged in , @entity270 detects nearby phones and computers and uses them to track people 's location and patterns , figuring out who they are , where they go and what they do online			2
to demonstrate the device without breaking any laws , @entity266 showed his own information as sniffed out by one of the devices			2
using a gaming engine and @entity302 , he hovered over his dot on a map			0
it brought up his name , e-mail address , a photo , the dating website he used , details about his devices and the locations he visited in town			0
in a worst - case scenario , as imagined by @entity266 , a miscreant could plug in one of the devices under any @entity318 near a capital building to pick up the scent of a state senator and wait for them to do something compromising			0
" you find somebody with power and exploit them , " said @entity266			0
the creation is remarkable for how simple it is			0
it 's likely others have similar knowledge and setups that exploit the same security flaws in applications , websites , devices and networks			2
industrial facilities the most frightening targets highlighted at the conference were the opposite of personal			0
critical infrastructure such as oil and gas pipelines or water treatment plants are potential targets for hackers			0
many industries are controlled with supervisory control and data acquisition , or @entity350 , systems			0
the systems are older , installed at a time when people were n't concerned about cyberattacks , and connect to the internet over an unsecured network protocol			0
the reason the systems are online in the first place is so that they 're easier to monitor			0
some , like oil pipelines , are often in remote locations			0
multiple demonstrations at the conferences showed just how simple it is to hack energy systems			2
researchers @entity366 and @entity367 staged a mock hack of an oil well using pumps and a liquid container filled with teal liquid			2
they got into the system , turned the pumps on and off and overflowed the containers by feeding the system false data			0
if it happened on an actual oil well , the hack could result in an environmental catastrophe , according to the researchers			2
it 's possible to shut down an entire industrial facility from 40 miles away using a radio transmitter , according to researchers @entity386 and @entity388			2
they demonstrated injecting fake measurements , causing the device that received them to behave differently			0
for example , someone could trigger a water tank to overflow by faking an abnormally high temperature			0
the industries and @entity98 government are aware that industrial systems are vulnerable , but their remoteness and age make upgrading difficult and expensive			0
there is no built - in system for releasing software patches , like there is with personal computers .			2

security researchers showed the latest phone , home and car hacks in @entity15
smartphones were hacked through chargers , malware and femtocells
some cameras in computers , toys and smart @entity421 can be *secretly* viewed by third parties
