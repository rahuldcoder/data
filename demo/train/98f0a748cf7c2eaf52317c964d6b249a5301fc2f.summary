@entity0 -- a federal judge on thursday denied a petition of @entity4 to consolidate two pending racketeering cases against the reputed mobster , ruling in favor of prosecutors ' requests to dismiss the lesser 1994 indictment in an effort to focus on 19 murder charges			1
interim defense attorney @entity13 had requested the merger , which prosecutors argued was meant to complicate the more severe charges that @entity4 faces			1
@entity13 had accused federal prosecutors of dropping the less serious charge in order to " game the system " and allow a different judge to hear the case			0
the racketeering indictment , filed in 1995 , had been assigned to @entity26 district judge @entity25			1
the murder charges are part of a case brought in 2000 and assigned to a different judge			0
" the government 's apparent forum shopping is contrary to the public interest and undermines public confidence in the judicial process , " @entity13 argued			1
" the government 's actions , choosing to pursue a new indictment , rather than a superseding indictment before this @entity38 , reflect a manipulation of the case			1
@entity25 ruled against @entity13 's request during the first of two hearings thursday afternoon in @entity0			1
in a second hearing , magistrate judge @entity46 appointed prominent defense attorney @entity48 as @entity4 's public defender after it became clear the accused mobster lacked the resources to pay for his own attorney			1
@entity48 said the case represented " a daunting task , but we 're up for it			1
" prosecutors -- who said @entity60 agents seized more than $ 822,000 in cash from @entity4 's @entity62 , @entity63 , apartment -- said he should have picked up his own legal tab			1
" he has every incentive to lie and stick the taxpayers with the bill for his defense , " prosecutors wrote in court papers filed tuesday			0
they said @entity4 has admitted to stashing more money away with " people he trusted " but would not name , and suggested that @entity4 's brother @entity74 could pay for a lawyer			1
clad in an orange jumpsuit and flanked by two security guards , @entity4 was escorted off a helicopter at @entity79 in @entity0 and then ushered to a van that brought the alleged mobster to court			2
the helicopter brought @entity4 to @entity0 from a jail in @entity85 , @entity86 , where he was being held			2
his arraignment is set for july 6			1
@entity4 's attorneys have also argued that leaks about the case endanger the former fugitive 's right to a fair trial on murder charges			1
" if it is now possible -- and mr. @entity4 seriously questions whether it will be possible -- for mr. @entity4 to receive a fair trial , law enforcement leaks of nonpublic information must end , with disclosures of information limited to the judicial process , " @entity13 wrote			2
in an affidavit unsealed by a judicial order , @entity26 attorney @entity104 said the leaks issue was a " grave concern			0
" she said law enforcement agencies must ensure no information is released prior to introduction in court			0
@entity113 also indicated she may call for an investigation into the matter			0
prosecutors say the 81 - year - old @entity4 was the boss of @entity0 's @entity118 mob before he fled an impending racketeering indictment in 1995			1
at the same time , he was an @entity60 informant whose handler tipped him off about the charges -- a tale that became the basis for the @entity125 - winning crime drama " @entity126			0
" @entity4 was arrested last week in @entity63 , along with his longtime girlfriend , 60 - year - old @entity127			2
she has been charged with harboring a fugitive			0
his brother , @entity74 , is a former president of the @entity130 and a state senate leader			0
he was forced to step down from his university job after then - gov. @entity133 , now a @entity135 presidential candidate , accused him of being evasive during congressional testimony about the whereabouts of his brother , " @entity4			2
" @entity4 lived " a relatively comfortable lifestyle " for the 16 years he was a fugitive , taking numerous gambling trips to @entity141 , according to a government document filed in his case			2
prosecutors say @entity4 waived his miranda rights after his arrest and told agents who were taking him back to @entity0 that he had been " a frequent traveler as a fugitive , " according to the government			2
" @entity4 acknowledged visiting @entity141 on numerous occasions to play the slots and claimed he won more than he lost , " the filing said			0
" @entity4 also admitted traveling to @entity153 and then crossing over into @entity154 to purchase medicines			0
" @entity4 also told the feds that he traveled back to @entity0 " on several occasions while ' armed to the teeth ' because he ' had to take care of some unfinished business , ' " the document said			0
@entity4 refused to tell the agents any details of his @entity0 visits , it said			0
@entity1 's @entity167 and @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
