-- when @entity2 fled war - torn @entity3 as a frightened teenager , the nation was descending into darkness , mired in the grip of a long civil conflict			1
but several years later , when she returned to the @entity11 as an ambitious archaeologist , her fierce determination and meticulous fieldwork brought to light the region 's rich cultural heritage			1
in 2007 , her archaeological pursuits resulted in the discovery of 5,000 - year - old rock art in @entity18 , a breakaway state in the northwest corner of @entity3			1
the prehistoric findings , which include renderings of animals as well as human figures , are significant in enhancing understanding about the prehistoric way of life across the region , says @entity2			1
@entity18 's first archaeologist , @entity28 is now on a mission to preserve and protect what she says is a heritage at risk of disappearing			1
ancient findings like the rock paintings , which were discovered at @entity36 , in a sandstone shelter near the @entity38 , not only have historic importance , but also help restore a sense of self - esteem and cultural pride in the people of @entity18 , she says			1
many were completely unaware of the existence and significance of archaeology before the discovery of the cave paintings			0
" i would bring them to the site and explain how important the site is potentially for helping them , " @entity2 says			2
" initially it was very difficult to communicate that but after a while i managed to get their attention -- they even ended up sort of feeling a sense of dignity that actually ' this is our site ' -- a feeling that ' we have nothing but we have this			0
' @entity18 declared independence in 1991 , but is n't internationally recognized as a separate state			2
@entity2 spent her early years in @entity3 's capital @entity70 , along with her identical twin sister @entity71			2
there , the two sisters enjoyed a normal childhood until a bloody conflict erupted in 1982			0
their mother decided that their future would not be in @entity3 and started to plan an escape to @entity79			0
when the two sisters arrived in the @entity82 country , they encountered a completely different reality to the one they were used to before			0
" i remember the first feeling was like a glass of milk in a fridge -- sort of thinking why is it so cold ? but i think we got used to it , " @entity2 recalls			2
" the fact that it was totally , completely different to what we had experienced was in a way healing itself , because now you had nothing to associate with what we had been through -- you could sort of reinvent yourself in a new world , " she says			0
determined to make the most of their new opportunities , @entity28 and her sister settled for a few years in @entity79 before relocating to the @entity105 to pursue their studies			2
@entity28 's professional journey brought her back to @entity18 a few years ago , where she embarked on a mission to unearth its cultural heritage			1
but while discovering significant archaeological findings , she also saw first - hand the tough conditions people lived in			0
" there was no access to clean water , there was no access to basic education especially in the rural areas where the archaeology was , " she says			0
" so for me , finding an extraordinary archaeological site i had to think how is this going to help these people and not just me as a researcher			0
" stemming from that sense of social responsibility , @entity2 helped set up and now heads @entity18 's @entity127 , a branch of the @entity128			1
dividing her time between @entity18 and the @entity105 , she is determined to educate her fellow @entity129 about their history as well as raise awareness across the world about @entity129 cultural heritage			1
" i feel very committed , " she says			0
" my hope for this is to be able to set up an institution which can help produce students -- @entity129 archaeologists , @entity129 cultural heritage managers			1
