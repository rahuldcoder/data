-- @entity1 came closer to scratching their 12 - year @entity3 itch with a 1 - 0 home victory over defending champions @entity5			1
the @entity7 side want to reach the @entity9 final for the first time since 2002 while the @entity12 champions are out to become the first team to defend the @entity3 trophy			2
with so much at stake , attack and counter attack flowed in waves inside an electric @entity19 wednesday as two of @entity22 's top sides delivered on their promise to provide footballing fever in the semi-final			0
the opening -- and only -- goal of the match was a fine example of the ebb and flow			0
@entity1 defender @entity32 had blocked an early effort by @entity5 striker @entity34 and @entity35 soon found the ball at his feet			1
@entity1 's talisman -- back from hamstring and knee problems -- switched the play from defense to attack , picking out @entity43 with a perfectly - weighted ball			2
@entity43 threaded the ball through to @entity45 , who tapped in after 19 minutes to edge real into the lead			1
just minutes later , @entity35 found himself in space in front of goal			1
but the golden touch of the @entity52 footballer deserted him as he scooped the ball over the bar and raised his arms to the heavens in anguish			0
@entity57 , fed by @entity35 , missed another good chance to double @entity1 's advantage when his left footed shot went high and wide			1
@entity5 turned the screw on the @entity63 side as the first half wore on , dominating possession , but despite the best efforts of @entity68 and @entity69 the home side kept them at bay			1
@entity35 quickly got down to business at the restart as he had a shot palmed away by @entity74			2
the @entity5 goalkeeper had his work cut out on his return to the team and he was again forced to save a fierce shot from @entity35			1
at the opposite end , @entity69 , who left @entity1 to join @entity80 , had motored towards goal on a solo run but his shot was safely collected by @entity85 , who later punched away another @entity5 effort			1
@entity87 recovered from flu in time to replace @entity35 in the later stage of the @entity3 tie and the @entity91 also forced a save from @entity74			1
but it was @entity5 substitute @entity94 who almost had the last say with a powerful shot on goal only for @entity85 to instinctively block his strike			2
the @entity12 side had a late appeal for a penalty turned down by @entity103 referee @entity102			0
@entity1 will now travel to @entity5 's @entity104 next week with a slender advantage while @entity5 manager @entity106 must work out how to make his team 's possession pay			1
" everything is still possible in this tie , " @entity5 keeper @entity74 told @entity22			2
" we expect a similar game in the return leg			0
" we have to keep focused and take advantage of our opportunities			0
" @entity1 coach @entity116 , who along with @entity106 has lifted the @entity9 trophy as both a player and a manager , said : " the fans helped the team a lot			0
we want to do everything we can to take them to @entity126			0
" we need everything in the second leg ; sacrifice , courage , quality			0
we have a small advantage but nobody knows what will happen			0
" he added he expects both @entity35 and @entity87 to be fully fit for next tuesday 's second leg			2
in the other semi-final , played on tuesday evening , @entity135 and @entity136 played out a goalless draw			0
an impenetrable defensive display from the @entity141 side restricted the @entity63 hopefuls to just a handful of chances			1
a place in the @entity3 final in @entity126 on 24th may is still up for grabs as all four teams prepare to renew rivalries in next week 's return legs .			0

@entity1 edge out @entity5 in @entity3 semi-final first leg
@entity157 @entity45 scores only goal after 19 minutes
@entity35 returns from *injury* to help *inspire* @entity63 side
@entity5 dominate possession but can not *convert* chances
