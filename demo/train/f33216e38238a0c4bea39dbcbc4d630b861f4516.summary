-- for all their buzz and value , location - based social networks have n't really gone mainstream yet			1
only 7 percent of @entity4 are aware of location - based social networks , according to data from @entity6			1
part of the explanation for this is that the majority of mobile users are n't using smartphones			0
and as a result , just 10 percent of those surveyed use mobile location services at least once a week , according to the @entity18 's latest @entity17 survey			2
for smartphone users , like those of the @entity21 ( a popular device among early adopters ) , that number jumps all the way up to 63 percent			2
still , even with smartphones predicted to overtake feature phones sometime next year , there may still be adoption hurdles for location - based social networks			1
here 's a look at why location - based services have n't yet hit critical mass and what those platforms are doing about it			1
privacy concerns remain an issue @entity36 , director of industry initiatives and partnerships at the @entity18 , said location - based services are n't growing as quickly as they should be			1
one reason for the lag is concern over privacy and who has access to users ' data			0
sites like @entity49 , which humorously bring awareness to location - based privacy issues , may have scared some social media users from opting in			1
furthermore , the use of geo - location data for commercial purposes has also raised concerns , prompting the @entity58 subcommittee on @entity59 to hold hearings on the issue			2
concerns about loopholes in @entity63 that give others the ability to announce your check - inshave also been raised			0
" there 's still a perceived risk in accessing location data , " van @entity36 said			0
location - based service providers are addressing these concerns by giving consumers more control			1
most current iterations of the popular location - based networks allow users to opt - out of location tagging and notifying users when their location is being shared			1
consumer education is also key			0
users need to know how their location data will be used , and feel comfortable that the companies that have access to it will behave responsibly , according to @entity88			2
she said consumers will become more comfortable sharing information with their friends and trusted applications			0
brands will view these services as less risky , and more mainstream , and new types of location - based services will come to the forefront			1
where is the value ? because of privacy concerns , it is imperative for location - based services to clearly communicate the value proposition to users			1
without a clear picture of what they 're getting in return , users may be hesitant to share location data			0
one of the ultimate promises of location - based check - ins is more accurately targeted advertising			1
for some users , the privacy concerns of sharing their location might be trumped by the potential utility of receiving highly targeted advertising and promotions			0
however , even though @entity121 , @entity63 , @entity122 and @entity123 allow for check - ins at " places , " rather than just map coordinates , which makes the data more valuable for targeted advertising , actual advertiser value has n't yet totally materialized			0
@entity128 , a senior analyst and program director at @entity131 / @entity130 said check - ins represent the makings of a business model , but they have n't reached their full potential value yet because there is n't a well - defined system to buy and sell advertising			0
" i think it does have a lot of staying power			0
we 're only going to see it grow and evolve , " he said			0
for early adopters , though , the long - term promise of more value through targeted ads , coupons and deals , along with the game mechanics ( i.e. , badges and " mayor " competitions ) instituted by some networks has made location - based services worth the potential privacy headaches			1
as @entity156 and @entity157 move into the location tagging space , they might finally take the trend mainstream			1
during its chirp developer conference in april , @entity156 announced the launch of its annotations feature , which gives users the ability to attach metadata to tweets , including location			1
@entity157 , meanwhile , will also reportedly soon enable members to add location details to their status updates and release an api so other apps can offer location ability to @entity157 users			1
each network faces the usual hurdles for location adoption			0
for @entity156 , the biggest problem might be convincing users of the value of location - enabled tweets			1
@entity156 has yet to clearly communicate to users what they get in return for adding location to their tweets			1
on their knowledge base page explaining the feature they write that location will help you " add context to your updates and help you join the local conversation , wherever you are			0
" @entity156 gives an example of one user tweeting about the weather in one location , while another user tweets about traveling to that very location			2
unfortunately for @entity156 , compared to sites like @entity63 and @entity121 which clearly indicate the value -- every check - in is part of a game , you can find your friends , get tacit recommendations for places to go , and maybe score a deal or two -- @entity156 is only communicating what feels like a very niche and impractical value proposition			1
further , because location is off by default for all users , without a more clearly communicated message , the feature may remain off for many people			0
@entity157 , meanwhile , faces the other major problem : privacy			0
because @entity157 has had so many different privacy issues over the years , many users are wary of new features			2
and @entity157 has n't always had the best track record when it comes to rolling out new features in a way that people trust			2
so how they roll out location to users and how well they do at making users feel that their information is safe may be make or break for location on @entity157			1
one thing @entity157 does have in its favor is a great track record of getting people to eventually use new services en masse -- concerns or not			2
when @entity157 launched its news feed feature in 2006 it faced a very vocal user backlash			0
a few months and a few tweaks later , the feature was widely used and has become an integral part of the service			0
the advantage for both @entity156 and @entity157 is that their users already have a built - in network of followers and friends , so they do n't have to sign up for a new service and start adding people to it			1
the location feature is simply an add - on to their existing account			0
" @entity157 could really be the looming giant that could wipe all [ other location services ] away , " @entity128 said			2
" @entity157 has proven to have so many users who are mobile			2
if they turn on that feature , it 's the looming category killer			0
" what remains to be seen is if the users will go for it			0

sites and apps that let users track their locations get buzz from tech media
but the sites are not achieving mainstream popularity , according to surveys
only 7 percent of @entity4 are aware of location - based social networks
@entity157 and @entity156 may soon popularize the idea , however .
