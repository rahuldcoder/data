it was the first meeting between @entity9 and @entity1 officials since the december death of @entity1 leader @entity103 and the transition in leadership to his son @entity106			1

and that 's great ; that 's good , " one @entity0 official said			0
" and they 're doing it within the 100 - day mourning period that 's self - declared in @entity1			2
