older " girls " all over the country can relate to			1
teased for bringing her " @entity7 " thermos to school , the first - grader opted instead to shield her love of the series from public scrutiny and asked her mom for a pink thermos instead			1
at the tender age of 7 , the boys in her class had a hard time accepting that she could like light sabers and @entity20 knights just as much as they did			0
it would be easier for @entity2 to be what people expected her to be , even if it meant hiding part of who she really was			0
the more times change , the more sci - fi stereotypes stay the same			0
not just ' guys living in their basements ' the evolution of science - fiction and fantasy started decades ago , but sad to say , as @entity2 's experience shows , it 's still not there yet			1
part of the reason could be that many of us , um ... shall we say , " older " fans have also shielded our love of the great imaginative stories that sci - fi delivers from public view			1
i admit that whenever i told anyone i work with at @entity0 that i really loved the " @entity49 " series on @entity48 , i quickly followed with a " @entity50 called it the best television series of 2005 , " as if the fact that i loved the show were n't enough			2
" laugh if you want , " wrote @entity55 , " but this story of enemies within is dead serious , and seriously good			0
" read more about " @entity49 " i ( like many others , i suspect ) thought that people simply could n't take me seriously if they knew that part of me loved these fascinating tales of faraway places , worlds unexplored or the ever - present themes of beating the undefeatable , facing the ultimate challenge and overcoming evil			0
the numbers show i 'm clearly not alone			0
just take a look at who 's watching the network solely devoted to science - fiction and fantasy programming			1
" it 's always been very gender - balanced			2
it has this misconception that it 's about the guys living in their basements			0
our audience has been about 50 - 50 , " said @entity79 , president of the newly rebranded @entity48 network ( formerly @entity48 )			1
" i think it 's one of those urban myths that 's existed for a very long time : they are the stereotypical sci - fi fan , and people ignore women and families ... dating back to when we were all at school			1
" so you think you know the sci - fi audience ? did you know that some 67 % of viewers who tune in to watch @entity98 slay the evil vampires ( in reruns , albeit ) are women ? and they 're not just tuning in to see the exciting possibilities vampires present			1
@entity79 -- who is also president of a horror flick network called @entity106 , which he says reaches about 40 million households -- says that about 53 % of the " @entity109 " audience are female			2
" people think they 're not into science - fiction , and then you look at who 's going to see ' @entity113 ' or ' @entity114 ' or ' @entity115			1
' ... science - fiction is the most mainstream genre , period			1
" oh , yeah , did i mention that @entity79 says the average age of those @entity48 - watching women is about 45 ? one size does not fit all it 's much better to be a " @entity7 " fan today than it was when i was kid			1
not because the story has changed but because the characters have			0
in " @entity7 ' " new animated life on @entity128 ( which , like @entity0 , is owned by @entity129 ) " @entity131 " features a girl who is a @entity20 apprentice			2
the character @entity132 is a strong - willed , determined and often sassy @entity20 - in - training who at times comes to the rescue of her know - it - all master			0
it 's something not lost on actress @entity139 , the voice of @entity132			1
" i have to give @entity141 credit for creating the character of @entity132 , " @entity139 said			2
" she is the first female @entity20 who has been the focus of the series			0
they have created a series with several female characters as lead characters , and sometimes the women carry the episodes			0
they are making it ok for these women to be the leads			0
now , when the kids are playing ' @entity7 ' on the playground , there is a @entity20 for the little girls to be			1
for the girls who do n't want to be a princess , they can be a padawan			0
" @entity139 was so passionate about giving the girls permission to " get their girl on " that she negotiated rights with @entity141 to develop a line of clothing called her universe and other products aimed strictly at the female market			1
" i started working on ' @entity131 ' almost five years ago , and i was always a ' @entity7 ' fan and wanted to show it off , and so i went to the @entity172 and to stores , and i realized it did n't really exist			2
there were very few products , and on one site , under the women 's section , they had men 's shirts , " said @entity139 , who is persuading executives at @entity175 to carry the line			1
she also gives credit to another actress , @entity185 , who started a clothing line called @entity187 for female sports fans			1
" i 'm aware of her line because my husband plays baseball , and i 've bought several of her pieces , " said @entity139 , who spent close to three years convincing people there was a market for this			2
" we started at conventions and events and online and at @entity202 , where the ' @entity7 ' celebration and the support was overwhelming			2
i do n't want this to just be a merchandise line			0
i want it to be a community for female fans			0
one thing i found in my research is that girls were hiding the fact that they were sci - fi fans , and many women were afraid to say ' i 'm a girl , and i like " @entity7 " or " @entity216			1
" ' they did n't feel like they could be taken seriously			0
" and @entity139 has a message for 7 - year - old @entity2 : " we can show our pride and be a girl at the same time and be proud of it			2
i 'm a nerd and a geek , and i 'm proud of it			0
so show who you are and what you like , and if you 're confident , people will leave you alone			0
