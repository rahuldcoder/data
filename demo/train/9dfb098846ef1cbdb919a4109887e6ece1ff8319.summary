-- rejection -- even repeated rejection -- does n't have to mean defeat			2
that , it turns out , is the lasting lesson of the @entity7 story			1
you may recognize the name ; two sundays ago , i wrote about @entity11 , the spectacularly successful author of the @entity13 books , and about how she has published a detective novel under the name @entity16			1
in the column , i recalled what a young and frustrated writer -- @entity7 -- did in the 1970s			1
to briefly recap : @entity7 had written a mystery novel that had been turned down everywhere he sent it			1
so , as an experiment to see how the publishing business really worked , he retyped a @entity24 - winning novel -- " steps , " by @entity26 -- and submitted it to 14 major publishers and 13 top agents			1
but he did n't put a title on it , and he did n't put @entity26 's name on it			2
every publisher and every agent turned it down			1
none recognized that they were rejecting a book that had already been a bestseller and had already won the @entity24			2
so much for talent being judged on its own merit			2
a fine and funny tale , some 35 years ago			1
but what happened to @entity7 ? " when i was in my 20s , i had been selling cable television subscriptions door - to - door in @entity47 , @entity48 , " @entity7 told me the other day			1
he had written his mystery novel in his spare time			2
" i taught myself to touch - type , " he said			0
what really bothered him about his mystery novel being turned down by every publisher to whom he sent it was not just that the various editors claimed not to like it -- but that they had n't bothered to give it a thorough reading			1
how did he know that ? he was a highly creative young writer ; to set his manuscript apart from all the others that authors send in , he had thought up a gimmick			1
he had put a little seal on the last few pages of the manuscript -- the pages that were the payoff to his story			1
it was intended to be a clever enticement ; when the editors at the publishing houses got to the end , they would remove the little seal to read the climax of the book			2
but when every publisher sent the manuscript back to him , with letters telling him why they did n't want his story , he noticed something : the seals on the last few pages had not been broken			2
not on any of the manuscripts			0
no one at the publishing houses had read the book all the way through , or even flipped to the end to see how @entity7 had wrapped up the story			1
" rather depressing , " he told me the other day			0
that 's when he got the idea to send @entity26 's prize - winning book in without @entity26 's name on it			0
he wanted to see if even a proven bestseller , without a well - known byline , would get a fair shake			0
the repeated rejection of that book , he said , did n't depress him the way the rejections of the mystery novel had : " with the @entity26 book , it was n't my work they were rejecting -- it was his			0
" ( @entity11 , in her younger days , probably could have identified with all of this			0
her first @entity13 manuscript was rejected by a number of publishers -- some reports say it was as many as a dozen -- before one house decided to take a chance on it			2
) i asked @entity7 : when the news of his @entity26 ploy got out and was widely publicized back in the ' 70s , did any of the publishers and agents salute his ingenuity , and offer to take another look at his own mystery novel ? " no. " did they encourage him to send them future work ? " no. " but , despite that , @entity7 triumphed			1
" i 'm an optimistic guy , " he said			0
" i wake up on the sunny side of the bed			0
" he wrote a terrific piece about the @entity26 stunt for @entity134 magazine , which at the time was very popular in @entity48			2
the story got a good reception , and he received more assignments from the magazine			0
on the strength of that , he realized that he might be able to make a living as a writer			1
he was able to quit the door - to - door cable - subscription - selling job , and went on to staff writing and editing jobs at a series of publications			1
he worked for the @entity148 , served as a reporter on the television beat for the @entity151 , went to @entity152 , became an editor and reporter for @entity155 , was named editor of the trade publication @entity157 , became that magazine 's editor and publisher when it was renamed @entity161 , and , when it went online - only , was named its managing director , the job he has today			0
in short , after those initial rejections -- both of his mystery novel and of the retyped @entity26 book -- he has managed to make a lifelong career out of the written word			1
along the way , he got married and has four children			0
" i have no regrets at all , " he said			0
he never did have a book published ; he 's certain that the mystery novel he wrote in the ' 70s is stored in a box or trunk somewhere -- " i do n't throw things away " -- but he has n't seen it in years			0
he wanted to find a good life as a writer , and he did			0
and the initial turn - downs are what , in their own unexpected way , helped him to find it			0
" sometimes , " he said , " it takes a little luck			0
" and sometimes , things have a way of working out			0
