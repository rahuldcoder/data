terrorists will stop at nothing to keep @entity3 girls from receiving an education			1
" people are crazy , " said @entity5 , founder of a girls ' school outside @entity7			1
" the day we opened the school , ( on ) the other side of town , they threw hand grenades in a girls ' school , and 100 girls were killed			1
" every day , you hear that somebody 's thrown acid at a girl 's face ... or they poison their water			0
" there were at least 185 documented attacks on schools and hospitals in @entity3 last year , according to the @entity25			1
the majority were attributed to armed groups opposed to girls ' education			1
" it is heartbreaking to see the way these terrorists treat ... women , " said @entity5 , 68			1
" in their eyes , a women is an object that they can control			0
they are scared that when these girls get an education , they will become aware of their rights as women and as a human being			1
" despite the threat of violence , @entity5 continues to open the doors of her @entity45 , a two - story , 14 - room building where 354 area girls are receiving a free education			1
" most of the ( local ) men and women are illiterate , " @entity5 said			1
" most of our students are the first generation of girls to get educated			1
" seven small villages make up @entity57 , where the school is located			2
though @entity57 is not @entity59 - controlled , @entity5 has still found it difficult to change the deep - rooted stigma against women 's education			1
on the evening before the school opened in 2008 , four men paid her a visit			1
" they said , ' this is your last chance ... to change this school into a boys ' school , because the backbone of @entity3 is our boys , ' " @entity5 recalled			1
" i just turned around and i told them , ' excuse me			0
the women are the eyesight of @entity3 , and unfortunately you all are blind			1
and i really want to give you some sight			0
' " @entity5 has not seen the men since			1
" you ca n't be afraid of people , " she said			0
" you have to be able to say ' no. ' maybe because i 'm old , the men are kind of scared of me , and they do n't argue with me			0
" the @entity45 teaches kindergarten through eighth grade			0
without her school , @entity5 says , many of the students would not be able to receive an education			1
" when we opened the school in 2008 and i had these students coming to register , 90 % of them could not write their name			1
and they were 12 - and 14 - year - old girls , " @entity5 said			1
" now , they all can read and write			0
" @entity5 's school teaches math , science , religion and three languages : @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			1
it recently added a computer lab with internet access			0
" they can touch the world just sitting in this house , " @entity5 said			2
" the knowledge is something that nobody can steal from them			0
" to shield the students from attacks , @entity5 has built a new stone wall to surround the school			1
she also employs staff and guards who serve as human guinea pigs of sorts			0
" the principal and the guard , they test the water every day , " @entity5 said			2
" they will drink from the well			0
if it 's ok , they 'll wait			0
... then they 'll fill ( the ) coolers and bring it to the classroom			0
" @entity5 says she is so scared of poisoning that school staff members accompany children to the bathroom and make sure the children do n't drink water from the faucet			1
additionally , the day guard arrives early each morning to check for any gas or poison that might be leaked inside the classrooms			0
the guard opens doors and windows and checks the air quality before any children are allowed to enter			0
" people are so much against girls getting educated , " @entity5 said			1
" so we have to do these precautions			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity155 born in @entity3 in the 1940s , @entity5 traveled to the @entity157 in 1970 to attend college			1
much of her family was killed or fled @entity3 during the @entity161 invasion			2
she stayed in the @entity157 , raised a son and opened a small tailoring business			2
she became an @entity157 citizen in 1990			0
@entity5 was always involved in various philanthropic efforts and community organizations in @entity167 , @entity168			2
she worked for many years to forge connections between @entity3 and @entity157			2
then the events of september 11 shook her to the core			0
" i was really affected personally by what happened to the innocent in the @entity157 , " she said			0
" it 's something that you can not imagine for a human being to do to other human beings			0
" almost overnight , @entity5 turned her small store into a workshop and launched an exhaustive campaign to help victims , first responders , @entity157 soldiers and @entity3 children			1
@entity5 and community volunteers sent 400 homemade blankets to rescue workers at ground zero and assembled and shipped nearly 200 care packages for @entity157 troops in @entity3			1
when she heard that @entity157 soldiers needed shoes to distribute to @entity3 children , @entity5 and her volunteers sent them more than 30,000 boxes of shoes			1
still , in the back of her mind was a bigger dream			0
on a visit to her homeland in 2002 , she noticed that women and girls were struggling from years of @entity59 control			2
" i saw that the girls had been the most oppressed , " she said			2
" the @entity59 regime was very brutal , brutal in the way that the woman had no place in their book			0
the woman had no right			0
" @entity5 said that while her life in @entity157 was fulfilling and rich , her dream was " to do something for @entity3 and to educate the girls			1
" so in 2004 , she began searching for land on which to build a school			2
in 2005 , she began fundraising through her @entity168 - based nonprofit , @entity5 's @entity219			1
then , on a visit to @entity3 , @entity5 was able to negotiate with the @entity221 to secure the land where the @entity45 now stands			1
" after five years now , ( the men ) are shoulder to shoulder with me , which is such a great thing , " @entity5 said			2
" it 's unbelievable how much they are proud of the girls			2
" the school is entirely free			2
@entity5 says it costs $ 300 to teach each girl for an entire year			2
those fees are covered by donations to her nonprofit			0
read about the @entity155 of 2012 although she is n't there every day of the week , @entity5 spends as much time at the school as possible			1
she meets with her students ' fathers and grandfathers two or three times a year to address any issues and make sure she still has their buy - in			2
she also deals with community elders and locals to ensure that the school has local support			0
@entity5 , who takes no money for her work with the school , believes the education her students receive will benefit not only future generations of @entity3 women but the country as a whole			1
" my school is very small			0
but for this to start here , i think it 's like a fire			0
and i think it will grow , " she said			0
" i hope that one day these girls ... will come back and teach , because i 'm not going to be there all my life			0
i want to make this school something that will last 100 years from now			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity268 's @entity270 website at @entity271 and see how to help .			0
