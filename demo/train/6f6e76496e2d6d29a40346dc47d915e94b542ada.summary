-- newly elected @entity2 ministers held their first parliamentary session this week , almost a year to the day after the start of historic protests in the capital led to the ouster of president @entity8			1
but for all the bravery and resilience the demonstrators showed by withstanding a brutal crackdown as they sang , waved flags and held candlelight vigils for 18 days , the movement began many years before			1
" being in the square , just feeling that energy , was one of the greatest experiences of my life , " said @entity16 , an @entity2 - @entity17 journalist who was standing among the protesters when news broke february 11 that @entity8 had decided to resign			1
" it felt like a roar but also a kind of relief , an enormous release of years of frustration and struggle			1
" in his new book , " @entity33 : inside the @entity37 and the @entity38 , " @entity16 explains some of the events that quietly laid the foundation for the uprising			1
he also predicts what may be ahead for @entity2 in 2012 as unprecedented elections take place , likely prompting more protests and violence			1
" there 's one camp that 's throwing up their hands and saying , ' oh , the revolution has n't brought us anything , ' " @entity16 said			1
are you there ? share your thoughts on the anniversary of the uprising			2
but many @entity2 , particularly older , experienced activists who lived through decades of oppression under @entity8 's rule , are far more optimistic			1
" they argue that this process , as messy as it may be , is a victory in itself , " he said			0
" this is a generation that believes this is democracy in progress			0
" @entity16 's parents emigrated from @entity2 in the late 1960s to get their doctorate degrees in the @entity17			1
in their home in suburban @entity71 , his parents spoke @entity72 , but @entity16 picked up almost none of it			1
but as he got older and considered becoming a journalist , he yearned to know more about his family 's background and more about @entity2			1
while studying at @entity78 , he went to @entity79 for a year on a study - abroad program			1
" i got the place in my blood and always thought about coming back , " he recalled			0
after graduation and a few years at a newspaper in @entity85 , @entity16 moved to @entity79 in 1997 to work as a freelance reporter			1
he had barely unpacked his bags and settled in when a terrorist attack turned the world 's focus on @entity2			1
fifty - eight foreign tourists were killed when @entity93 gunmen invaded a poorly guarded temple across the @entity95 from @entity96			0
the @entity96 massacre , @entity16 writes , was an important first stone in the path to january 2011			1
it crippled whatever sympathy some @entity2 might have had toward @entity103 militant groups , and it launched the career of @entity105 , who became interior minister under @entity8			2
photos : looking back at @entity2 's uprising at the time of the @entity96 massacre , @entity2 police were given a blank check to go after @entity93 groups			1
but the force also became something much darker , an " unchecked and unchallenged " authority that bullied @entity2 of all backgrounds			2
the police spied on and intimidated newspaper editors , business leaders , university professors and judges			0
" you heard anger boiling up about the police from every corner of @entity2 life , but it was hushed because there was such intense fear , " @entity16 said			1
@entity129 is believed to be @entity8 's right - hand man in the security forces ' violent actions against protesters			2
despite being beaten , tear - gassed and shot at , demonstrators rallied , specifically demanding @entity105 's dismissal			0
in february , just weeks after @entity8 was ousted , @entity2 froze @entity105 's bank accounts , banned him from traveling and arrested him			2
he was sentenced in may to 12 years in prison for money laundering and abuse of office			0
@entity8 , meanwhile , is on trial in @entity2 , accused of corruption and ordering the deaths of protesters			1
the former president suddenly fell ill after his resignation			0
watching him get wheeled into the courtroom on a stretcher , @entity16 is reminded of the @entity149 , who ran an over-the - top campaign to remain in office			1
it was a joke , the journalist said , because @entity8 was the only candidate on the ticket			0
" i was witness to so many fake elections , but ( this election ) was like @entity158 level of worship , like something you 'd see in @entity162			0
all the billboards and the newspapers were filled with ( photos and editorials ) venerating this guy , " @entity16 said			2
" it did n't reflect the way people really felt			0
" the propaganda was all the more fascinating because it served as a backdrop for small protests against the regime that popped up throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s			0
several took place on @entity177 's campus			0
the demonstrations focused on foreign policy issues involving @entity180 , and government security quickly disbanded them			0
those moments of protest never caught on in other parts of the country , or gelled much with anyone outside the university , because the demonstrators failed to agree on a unified message , @entity16 writes			2
some wanted to call out @entity8 by name , while others profoundly feared doing that			0
@entity93 protesters wanted the focus to remain entirely on @entity180 , leaving the president out of it			0
2011 's uprising was successful , many observers agreed , because demonstrators were on the same page about what they wanted and how to get it			0
" @entity33 " delves into a forgotten but highly significant footnote in the protests in @entity2			2
on the night that the @entity17 led the invasion of @entity209 in 2003 , a crowd gathered in @entity210 to rally against @entity8 's allowing @entity17 ships to take position in the @entity213			1
against the odds , the demonstrators overwhelmed security forces sent to disperse them and tore down a huge poster of @entity8 outside an office of his @entity219			0
@entity220 , a longtime @entity2 activist who helped fuel 2011 's movement , was at that rally			2
he remembers the night in " @entity33			0
" " the tone of @entity225 sentiment and the focus on the question of democracy really started then , " @entity220 said			0
" it started with ' down with @entity17 ' and turned to ' down with @entity8			2
' " for the rest of the decade , there were more fits and starts of protests and crackdowns while dissident expression took root in the arts and pop culture			0
disgust with the regime 's enforcement of sexual purity was mocked by a farcical movie that became an underground hit about young people going around @entity79 trying to find a secret place to watch a porno			0
a novel that mocked @entity2 's class system became a best - seller and was made into a film			1
but the tipping point for 2011 's revolution came just as it had in the preceding @entity257 revolution : with the death of a young person pushed to extraordinary action			0
@entity261 , a 28 - year - old computer wiz , was arrested in june 2010 by @entity2 police while he sat at an @entity264 © in @entity265			1
witnesses said police beat him to death			0
a postmortem picture of his mangled face was posted on the @entity272 and went viral			0
" @entity33 " includes intimate interviews with @entity261 's close friends , activists inspired by his death , witnesses to the night @entity261 died and bloggers who repeatedly posted a picture of a living , handsome @entity261 next to his morgue photo			0
in october , two @entity2 police officers were found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to seven years for @entity261 's death			1
the pictures of @entity261 are still fresh in most @entity2 ' memory			2
" i think a lot of @entity2 are just exhausted			2
they are realizing this is the first year mark of a 10 - year process , " @entity16 said			1
" but what they did , and what they want to do , is still clear			0
" @entity16 says elections in 2012 will almost certainly inspire more protests and clashes between authorities and the people , seen most vividly in november and december			2
economically , @entity2 will continue to struggle as tourism and foreign investment wanes			1
" there should n't be a rush to decide what will happen in @entity2 , " he said			2
" i 'm confident , and i think @entity210 showed us , that @entity2 have an incredible determination to get it right			1

one year *ago* january 25 , protesters began gathering in @entity210
@entity2 - @entity17 reporter says that many events over years led to uprising
@entity16 : many in @entity2 say current struggle is " victory in itself "
