as the @entity1 convened a day - long summit on working families with a heavy focus on work - life balance , i remembered a major survey last year that took issue with the prevailing notion that juggling work and home life is mainly a woman 's issue			1
according to a survey by the @entity15 , 56 % of working mothers said it was very or somewhat difficult to balance the responsibilities of their jobs and their families ; 50 % of working fathers , nearly as many as working mothers , said the very same thing			1
and when it comes to who is doing more of the telecommuting , another survey also challenges the longstanding belief that it 's mainly working moms			1
by a wide margin , more men than women are working not from the office , but from home , a business center or another location , according to the national survey by @entity39 , which works with organizations and individuals to create flexible workplaces			1
nearly one - third of the 556 full - time employed adults who were surveyed said they do most of their work remotely , and nearly three out of four of those telecommuters were men			2
why do these findings matter ? because too often , when work - life balance is discussed among policymakers , in the media , even online , the general sense is that it 's primarily a concern of women , especially working mothers			1
" the significance of the research is that it proves that the way we think and talk about work - life flexibility does n't track with reality , " said @entity56 , chief executive officer and founder of @entity58 " as a result , both business and people are n't reaping the rewards of a more thoughtful , deliberate , strategic approach to managing work and life			1
" and when these misperceptions are held by c - suite executives , they can dramatically impact how far organizations might go to create more flexible workplaces for their employees			0
" an everyone issue " consider a recent analysis of interviews with nearly 4,000 executives worldwide conducted by @entity83 students from 2008 to 2013			0
both male and female executives considered the " tension between work and family to be primarily a woman 's problem , " according to the report			2
" as @entity99 recently pointed out in the @entity100 , when we 're trying to solve the problem of not enough women in the upper echelons of business , tech , and politics , we always direct these conversations at women themselves , " wrote @entity91 for @entity92 earlier this year			0
" but the problem here is n't women 's lack of ambition or , necessarily , their lack of support at home			1
the issue is that we need to get men to acknowledge work - life conflicts as an everyone issue , not a women 's issue or a mom 's issue , " wrote @entity91			1
@entity119 , vice president for brand communications for @entity121 , an online home improvement network , said in today 's 24/7 connected world , work - life balance becomes an issue for nearly everyone , women and men			1
watch : why @entity129 's sister says to log off " in my experience people often feel the need to be accessible at all times to demonstrate their commitment to the job , " said @entity119			0
" answering e-mail at 3 a.m. becomes a badge of honor			0
when that becomes the societal norm , it makes it hard for people to find a healthy work - life balance			1
" @entity145 , a co-owner and managing partner of @entity147 , a marketing , public relations , design and web development firm , said work - life balance is an issue for both genders , and not just working parents			1
" i am not a parent			0
i am a co-owner of a company with over 20 employees ( who are my family ) and i feel guilty not ' working ' all the time or being readily available for my team during all hours of the day , " said @entity157 on @entity158			2
" i try not to look at my phone after 9 p.m. but it is a challenge			0
... most business owners do n't have the choice to not respond to their team / clients in a timely fashion			0
" weakened commitment to flexibility ? after @entity173 of @entity174 banned working from home shortly after taking over as the company 's chief executive officer , many women and men wondered if more companies might follow her lead and move in the direction of less flexibility as opposed to more			2
the results of another survey by @entity39 show that , at least as far as employees ' perceptions are concerned , that might be the case			0
while 97 % of those surveyed said they had some flexibility at work , more than four out of ten said they perceive a " waning commitment " to flexibility at their company , according to survey results released in may			2
in addition , only 40 % of those surveyed who had work - life flexibility received any guidance or training from their employer on how to use work - life flexibility most effectively			1
what all this means , said @entity56 , the expert on workplace flexibility , is that the majority of workers with flexibility " are flying by the seat of their pants and are not optimizing the flexibility they have to benefit themselves and the business			0
" " everyone loses ... including women , " she added			0
no " one size fits all " approach @entity119 of @entity225 says as a manager and leader within his company , he wants to help people find work - life balance -- or life - work balance , as he thinks we should call it			1
but he says it 's an issue that each person has to define for himself or herself			2
" we can not expect a ' one size fits all ' approach to the solution , " said @entity119			0
" maybe it is working from home one day a week , perhaps it is a commitment not to check mail on the weekend			0
whatever the solution people fundamentally develop as their own , they need to identify and respect the boundaries required to make it effective			0
" expanding the conversation about work - life balance to include men and people without children can lead to more workplace changes that benefit more employees , men and women i talked with say			1
it can also provide more opportunities for working parents , especially mothers who would choose to continue their professional paths if they and their partners had more flexibility to balance the demands at home			2
" having a partner split the child - rearing duties enables you to juggle your art / career / work with the responsibilities and fun that come with raising a child , " said @entity269 , who is head of the theater program at @entity271 and the mom of a college - age son			0
" the beauty of actually dividing the parenting labor , although it 's chaotic , is that when the child grows up , as my child has -- we both still have careers to come back to and the nest is too busy to feel empty			0
" how important is work - life balance to you ? share your thoughts in the comments or tell @entity293 on @entity294 or @entity295 on @entity158 .			1
