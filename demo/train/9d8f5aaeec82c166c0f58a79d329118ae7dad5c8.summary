-- the federal government 's response manager to the @entity4 oil disaster said sunday that @entity5 has made progress , but cautioned it was too early to call the effort a success			1
" we 're making the right progress			0
i do n't think anyone should be pleased as long as there 's oil in the water , " @entity12 adm. @entity11 said on @entity0 's " @entity13 " on sunday			2
@entity11 was responding to remarks over the weekend by @entity5 's senior vice president , @entity19 , who said the company was " pleased " with its operation to funnel crude up from the ruptured undersea well to a drilling ship a mile above on the @entity4			1
@entity19 said the company funneled about 250,000 gallons of oil in the first 24 hours from a containment cap , installed on the well , to a drilling ship on the ocean surface			1
on saturday , @entity5 had increased the amount of oil it was funneling to about 441,000 gallons to the surface			1
federal authorities estimate that 798,000 gallons of crude are gushing into the sea every day			2
@entity11 confirmed that @entity5 has been able to bring oil to the surface after placing the cap , but said no one should be pleased until a relief well is completed and the leaking stops			1
" this is an insidious enemy , " @entity11 said			0
" it 's attacking all of our shores , it 's holding the @entity4 hostage , basically			1
" in an apperance on @entity49 's " @entity48 , " @entity11 described the current state of the spill as a series of pools , ranging from 20 - 100 yards to several miles in length			0
" the spill has disaggregated over a 200 - mile radius around the wellbore			0
it 's not a monolithic spill			0
it is literally hundreds and thousands of smaller spills , " he said			0
even as the administration has tried to distance itself from @entity5 in recent days , with the @entity64 launching both criminal and civil investigations into the spill , it has not been enough to temper the frustration seething among residents along the coastline			1
@entity71 sen. @entity70 , a @entity72 , demanded that @entity5 donate $ 1 billion for a cleanup fund for the five @entity74 and said that president @entity77 " needs to push them to do that			1
" " i want to see this president more engaged here on the ground , working through problems , " @entity70 said			0
on " @entity13 , " @entity71 gov. @entity81 said his state was " as ready as we can be , " as the currents moved the oil eastward			2
in addition to a declaration of a state of disaster , @entity71 has about 250,000 feet of boom spread around the @entity90 and has another 250,000 feet available , @entity81 said			1
@entity71 is also pushing @entity5 to respond to claims made by business owners who are losing business and facing an economic crisis because of the spill			1
" in the short term , we want these claims to be responded to more quickly , " @entity81 said			0
" these people need help , and we need to be there to try to make them as whole as we can during this very difficult process			0
" @entity103 , the mayor of @entity104 , @entity105 , confronted @entity19 at the saturday news conference for not acting promptly when reports surfaced that tar balls were washing ashore			0
visibly upset , @entity103 said local officials had been asking to meet with @entity5 officials for over a month , but their requests went unanswered			1
" if you sensed our frustration , you would have been here a lot sooner , " @entity103 told @entity19			2
" people in @entity104 are starving to death now because they ca n't get out to catch the fish			0
" @entity11 said the @entity105 incident the mayor referred to was the result of a mechanical failure where a boom became disconnected before a skimmer arrived to prevent the oil from reaching the shore			2
overall , however , @entity11 said the federal government is in charge of making sure @entity5 is carrying out its cleanup responsibilities			1
in an effort to respond faster , @entity12 field commanders do n't need approval to get cleanup equipment out , @entity11 said			0
" if there 's oil out there , they need to call in skimming equipment , " he said			2
" we do n't want them to go two or three levels up to higher authority to be able to do that			0
i 've given direct orders to all my field commanders out there that when they see oil and they have the capability to respond and they 're to do it			2
" not all the @entity74 were suffering the effects of the spill equally			0
in @entity152 , barely any oil had appeared on the shores , but the state 's tourist industry was nonetheless feeling the pinch			1
" the truth is we 've had virtually no oil , " @entity152 gov. @entity157 told " @entity161			1
" " if you were on the @entity164 anytime in the last 48 days , you did n't see any oil at all			2
" the biggest effect the state has felt , @entity157 said , resulted from media reports saying that the entire @entity164 was affected			0
@entity152 's " tourist season has been hurt by misperceptions of what 's going on down here , " he said			1
on saturday , @entity11 told reporters that @entity5 planned to shut down valves in the cap -- which are allowing oil to escape -- once the pressure is eased			1
the ultimate capacity of the operation is 630,000 captured gallons a day , still shy of the amount spewing			2
earlier , coastal residents had anxiously awaited news of @entity5 's progress as elevated southerly winds pushed the perimeter of the spilled oil closer to shorelines as far east as the @entity90			1
the @entity188 predicted that scattered tar balls and light sheen would impact beaches as far east as @entity192 , home to popular destinations in @entity194			2
@entity71 beaches remained open saturday , but the number of beachgoers was down			2
the sun and surf were interrupted by sticky brown globs of oil washing up on the sugary sand and workers with blue rubber gloves and plastic bags trying to keep the beach clean			2
earlier , @entity81 walked the beach accompanied by " @entity209 " singer @entity208 , who is building a hotel on the @entity212 shoreline			0
" i saw some tar balls , " @entity81 said			0
" it 's terrible when you see something like that			0
" the oil spill has already threatened ecologically sensitive lands along the @entity164			0
images of oil - drenched pelicans were all over the @entity225 , prompting even more public anger toward @entity5			1
@entity77 sought in his weekly address saturday to ease fear along the @entity164 by reaffirming his commitment to clean up the worst oil spill in @entity232 history			0
" it 's brutally unfair			0
it 's wrong , " @entity77 said in the address , recorded a day earlier in @entity235 , @entity236			0
" and what i told these men and women -- and what i have said since the beginning of this disaster -- is that i 'm going to stand with the people of the @entity164 until they are made whole			0
" it appeared that @entity5 was making progress after capping the breached wellhead , @entity77 said , but he said that the federal government was " prepared for the worst			1
" he cited a series of statistics that illustrated the " largest response to an environmental disaster of this kind in the history of our country " : 17,500 @entity259 troops authorized for deployment ; 20,000 people currently working to protect waters and coastlines ; 1,900 vessels in the @entity4 assisting in the cleanup ; 4.3 million feet of boom deployed with another 2.9 million feet of boom available , enough to stretch over 1,300 miles ; 17 staging areas across @entity236 , @entity152 , @entity105 , and @entity71 to rapidly defend sensitive shorelines			1
meanwhile , the @entity188 issued a sliver of good news saturday			0
after reviewing images and data , the agency reopened more than 13,000 square miles of the @entity4 -- just west of the @entity275 and @entity276 -- for fishing			1
but at the same time , it closed a 2,275 - square mile area off the @entity90 , extending the northern boundary just east of the western edge of @entity282 , which means 32 percent of the @entity4 still remains off - limits for fishing			1
the @entity5 well erupted after an explosion and fire on the @entity289 drilling rig on april 20			1
the @entity5 - leased rig sank two days later , leaving up to 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) of oil pouring into the @entity4 daily , according to federal estimates .			1
