@entity0 -- the leader of @entity4 's center - right , pro-bailout @entity5 claimed " a victory for all @entity13 " after topping sunday 's parliamentary elections , a vote seen as a referendum on the survival of the continent 's common currency			1
@entity5 's @entity14 now finds himself facing a new round of coalition talks , six weeks after a previous election that failed to produce a government			0
in a brief address following sunday 's vote , he pledged to form a slate " determined to do what it takes and do it fast			0
" " today the @entity4 people expressed their will to stay anchored within the euro , remain an integral part of the eurozone , honor the country 's commitments and foster growth			1
this is a victory for all @entity13 , " @entity14 said			0
" i call on all parties that share those objectives to form a stable new government			0
" the unpopular bailouts that have kept @entity4 from defaulting on its debts in the face of an ongoing recession include budget cuts demanded by international lenders			1
voters punished @entity5 and its former coalition partners in the socialist party @entity45 in the earlier vote in may , but reopening the agreement would set up a confrontation with the other countries that use the euro -- the common currency of 325 million people across 17 @entity13 nations			1
markets appeared poised to react positively to news of the vote , as @entity58 stocks climbed			1
the @entity59 rose 1.7 % in early trading monday			1
with less than half of 1 % of ballots still to be counted , @entity5 had won nearly 30 % of the vote , according to @entity65 figures			0
but that showing translates to 129 seats in the country 's 300 - seat parliament , forcing it to seek other coalition members from the fragmented field			0
@entity14 has said his party wants to remain in the eurozone and alter existing policies , including stringent austerity measures , to " achieve development and offer people relief			0
" his leading rival , @entity79 of the left - wing , anti-bailout @entity80 , had called for the deal to be torn up			1
@entity85 leaders hailed the vote , with eurozone finance ministers praising results " which should allow for the formation of a government that will carry the support of the electorate to bring @entity4 back on a path of sustainable growth			1
" and in a joint statement , @entity96 president @entity95 and @entity98 president @entity97 said in a joint statement that they " support the continued efforts of @entity4 to put its economy on a sustainable path			2
" " today , we salute the courage and resilience of the @entity4 citizens , fully aware of the sacrifices which are demanded from them to redress the @entity4 economy and build new , sustainable growth for the country , " the @entity85 leaders said			1
@entity79 congratulated @entity5 late sunday , but said his party 's nearly 27 % showing has forced @entity4 leaders to realize the bailout " is a nonviable economic plan			1
" @entity14 " has the opportunity to form a government on the basis of the people 's verdict and on the basis of his own program , " @entity79 said			0
but he said @entity80 -- which was projected to win 71 seats -- would continue to demand " from the position of the opposition " that the bailouts be scrapped			1
" even if it did n't manage to take the first place , @entity80 is now the most basic body representing the average individual , the progressive and the anti-memorandum portion of our population , " @entity79 said			2
both @entity80 and @entity5 picked up 20 seats over their showings in the abortive may 6 vote , while @entity45 fell from 41 seats to 33			2
in the previous parliament , elected in 2009 , @entity45 held 160 seats , @entity5 held 91 and @entity80 , 13			2
what will @entity4 elections mean for the country 's future ? critics had feared that efforts to renegotiate the bailout would set up a confrontation that could lead to a run on @entity4 banks and deeper misery			2
" do n't underestimate the capacity of the @entity4 people to rise to the occasion , " @entity153 , a former @entity5 lawmaker and deputy finance minister , told @entity1			1
" what 's very clear is the @entity4 today voted , including those that voted for @entity80 , in favor of the euro and the @entity85 , " @entity153 said			1
he predicted that @entity4 could now come to better terms with its creditors , whom he said understand " that you can only squeeze so much so fast out of a country and out of its people			2
" @entity45 trailed in third place with about 12 %			0
its leader , @entity171 , said the parties need to hammer out a ruling coalition overnight			0
@entity171 proposed an alliance of @entity5 , @entity45 , the @entity175 -- which was running in sixth place with 6 % and a projected 17 seats -- and @entity80 , which has said it wo n't join a government that backs the continued bailout terms			1
" if we really want @entity4 to remain in the euro and to get out of the crisis for the benefit of every @entity4 family , by tomorrow we need a government , " he said			2
the @entity186 were running fourth at 7.5 % and 20 seats , while the nationalist , far - right @entity188 -- which called illegal immigration the country 's biggest issue -- appeared headed for a fifth - place finish at 7 % and 18			1
the @entity193 brought up the rear at 4.5 % and 12 seats , according to @entity65 figures			0
the @entity186 , a conservative nationalist party led by former @entity5 lawmaker @entity197 , saw its support shrink from 33 seats in may to 20 , while @entity188 -- which had n't won seats in parliament before -- held steady			0
a wild election weekend for @entity4 , @entity203 and @entity204 @entity4 has been suffering under a heavy burden of painful austerity measures , high unemployment and a long - running recession			2
@entity80 and @entity5 were effectively tied in the last official polls two weeks ago , in part because @entity80 was seen as offering something new and different , @entity4 journalist @entity209 said sunday			1
and @entity213 , managing director of @entity4 broadcaster @entity214 , said older @entity4 are scared -- " but the younger generation , they 're not scared , and they seem to have had enough of the recession they 're trying to get out of it by rebelling , effectively			2
" " unfortunately , the political system in @entity4 has not been honest with the voters , " @entity213 said			0
" and so a lot of people believe there is a way out of this without all the pain we have been suffering for the past two or three years			0
" the possibility that @entity232 could emerge as prime minister prompted waves of fear that @entity4 could crash out of the euro and @entity13 's ambitious experiment with a common currency could collapse			1
some analysts have estimated that the collapse of the euro would cost $ 1 trillion , while others say talk of the break - up of the currency is alarmist and unlikely to happen			0
since may 's vote , @entity4 has been roiled by uncertainty and division , and the country must identify additional budget cuts by the end of june to be considered " compliant " with the terms of its bailout program			2
the future of @entity13 : 3 scenarios @entity258 chancellor @entity257 , @entity13 's most powerful advocate of balancing budgets to build a strong basis for economic growth , urged @entity4 not to walk away from international loan deals			0
" we will stick to the agreements			0
that is the basis on which @entity13 will prosper , " she said saturday			0
but @entity266 , leader of the small @entity175 and a potential kingmaker in a closely divided parliament , said the country needed to escape " a situation that cuts us into small pieces and hurts society			0
" as economic crisis bites , @entity4 's children pay the price the situation in @entity4 is likely to be on the minds of world leaders as they meet in @entity279 on monday for the @entity280			1
some experts argue that a potential @entity4 exit would be manageable , assuming the @entity284 and @entity85 policymakers respond aggressively , while others worry that the pullout would cause chaos in financial markets and shock the global economy			1
@entity1 's @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294 contributed to this report .			0
