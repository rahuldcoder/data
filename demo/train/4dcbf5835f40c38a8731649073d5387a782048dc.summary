-- he grew up as the second son of late @entity4 president @entity3 , deep in the shadow of his father			1
@entity7 was never meant to rule			1
he studied medicine in @entity9 , receiving a degree in ophthalmology , and headed the @entity12			2
he switched his focus to military science , however , after the death in a 1994 car accident of his older brother , @entity17 , who had been groomed to follow his father into the presidency			1
the death meant @entity7 was the next heir to power			1
when the elder @entity3 died in june 2000 , it took only hours for the @entity4 parliament to vote to amend the country 's constitution to allow @entity7 to become president			1
the parliament lowered the age of eligibility of the president from 40 to 34 , allowing the then - 37 - year - old son to take over			2
read the latest news about the unrest in @entity4 within weeks , @entity7 was also made a member of the regional command for the ruling @entity34 , another requirement of succession			1
now , the unrest in southern @entity4 , with amateur videos of violent protests and bloodied bodies , is starting to define @entity3 's rule in the eyes of the world			1
human rights groups say such scenes are evidence of @entity4 security forces firing on their own people , though state - run television disputes the claims			1
@entity4 have lived in fear of political repression for decades			1
@entity3 ruled with an iron fist , ruthlessly putting down dissent by jailing dissidents and crushing the opposition			1
since 1963 , the country has been under emergency law , which effectively suspends most constitutional protections , according to the @entity60			2
the law authorizes the government to conduct preventive and arbitrary arrests , according to the @entity64			0

critics say @entity7 's security machine still holds a grip on the country -- and the president himself -- though he rejected that suggestion in a 2005 interview with @entity0			1
" they should choose , " he said of his critics			2
" you can not be a dictator and not be in control			0
" @entity84 , now 45 , denies he is a dictator , seeing himself instead as a modern leader			0
his official website says he has built free - trade zones , licensed more private newspapers and private universities , and fought government waste and corruption			0
he has also worked on social and economic reform			0
while there have been some changes during his 10 years of rule , @entity3 's promises have largely not been delivered			2
@entity97 calls it " the wasted decade " with a media that remains state - controlled , a monitored and censored internet , and prisons still filled with dissidents			0
activists say that with the current protests , however , @entity3 can no longer look away			0
" he has to start listening , " said @entity105 , executive director of the human rights group @entity106			1
" it 's the time to start listening and acting			0
he ca n't afford any more promises			2
" other analysts say force may have worked in the past to quell dissent , but not this time			0
" the government is going to try to continue to use the tactics that it has for a very long time , which is just to snuff out any protest , " said @entity113 , a professor of politics and international affairs at @entity116			0
