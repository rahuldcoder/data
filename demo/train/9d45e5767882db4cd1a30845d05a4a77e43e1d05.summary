-- it is difficult being an @entity2 engaged in civic activities , let alone working in government or politics			0
we @entity6 must always second - guess what we say , guard against people questioning our loyalty and make sure that nobody thinks we are trying to infiltrate the government to sabotage it from within and hand it over to the @entity14			1
most @entity15 would dismiss these accusations , especially the last one , as outrageous conspiracy theories written by loonies on their blogs			1
yet @entity2 public servants are facing these charges from sitting members of @entity23			2
the sad reality is that it has been happening for a decade , and has been met with complete indifference from the media and the public			0
recently , rep. @entity28 , briefly the front - runner for @entity31 presidential candidate , sent letters to the @entity33 , @entity34 and the @entity35 asking them to investigate @entity2 organizations , individuals and government employees to determine if they are infiltrating the government and sabotaging it from within			2
this week , @entity40 wrote an op - ed defending @entity28 's request			1
@entity28 and her friends -- @entity31 representatives @entity45 of @entity46 , @entity47 of @entity48 , @entity49 of @entity50 and @entity51 of @entity52 -- pulled out all the stops			2
they not only hurled these outrageous claims at our organization , the @entity55 , and others like ours , but also accuse secretary of state @entity62 's deputy chief - of - staff of being part of the conspiracy			1
@entity63 , married to former @entity65 rep. @entity64 , has served @entity66 since she was the first lady			2
the slurs against her are beyond malicious			0
they accuse @entity63 's late father and her family of being a part of an international conspiracy seeking to sabotage the @entity15			1
this latest witch hunt comes as no surprise to those of us in public life			1
this is a natural next step for hate mongers			0
first , people who do not have mainstream political backing start the rumors			0
next , if we take a page from sen. @entity88 's 1950s playbook , the rumors become accusations leveled by the most politically privileged			0
it 's simple -- the more accusations thrown at @entity15 muslims trying to serve their country , the harder it is for them to be hired and the more politicians shy away from engaging them			1
for years , we have watched presidential candidates talking about their discomfort with appointing @entity6 to senior positions in government			2
we have seen them sparring over our ethics and principles			0
legislation against @entity106 law has been introduced in 20 states , frightening residents into thinking @entity106 is an imminent threat			0
president @entity109 still faces vicious and pointed accusations of being a @entity6 , as though it were a slur			2
these attacks are real and hurt people 's lives			0
public servants have been forced out of jobs , with suspicion shadowing them			0
very few public officials have had the courage to publicly condemn the escalating witch hunt			1
will this latest absurdity finally force our politicians and policy - makers to not only defend someone like @entity63 , whose public service needs no defense , but also all @entity2 who serve this country every day ? a few @entity31 have rallied to @entity63 's side			1
this week , @entity130 , @entity28 's former campaign chief , denounced her in an op - ed on @entity132			1
speaker of the house @entity133 defended @entity63 's character			1
@entity46 @entity136 sen. @entity136 felt compelled to stand on the floor of the @entity138 and denounce the accusations			0
" ultimately , what is at stake in this matter is larger even than the reputation of one person			0
this is about who we are as a nation , and who we aspire to be , " he said			0
the question is whether this incident will serve as a tipping point			1
will our political and religious leaders and the media push back against @entity155 whose clear agenda is to marginalize @entity15 @entity6 ? will this wave of @entity158 be exposed , condemned and made politically unacceptable ? will @entity2 public servants be able to serve their country without suspicion ? every year , my organization brings 25 young @entity15 @entity6 leaders to @entity164 to help them better understand policy making			1
the majority are inspired to develop careers in government and public service			0
yet every year i ask myself : are these individuals better off in banking , medicine and less high - profile careers ? am i exposing them to a career that will be tarnished by the likes of @entity28 ? in the end , i still believe that the sacrifice to serve this nation and make @entity15 a better place is worth the headache , and heartache , of dealing with bigots -- including those in @entity23			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

@entity186 : @entity15 @entity6 in public life face *constant* *scrutiny* over loyalty
@entity186 : but @entity28 , four others take conspiracy theory to an *extreme*
he says @entity28 witch hunt indicts @entity62 's *longtime* *adviser* @entity63
@entity186 hopes this is a tipping point , when politicians stop tolerating this bigotry
