@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 courted far - right voters monday in advance of a may 6 runoff against @entity8 @entity7 , who won the most support in the first round of @entity3 's presidential elections			1
@entity2 said he has a " duty to listen " to far - right voters after @entity13 candidate @entity12 attracted a record amount of support in the first round of voting sunday			1
" we must respect the voters ' will , " @entity2 said monday , calling the support for @entity19 a " crisis vote			2
" @entity7 narrowly beat @entity2 as 10 candidates competed in the first round of the election			1
@entity7 and @entity2 now go to a second round because no one got a majority sunday			1
a poll of 1,004 people shows @entity7 with support from 54.5 percent of respondents compared with 45.5 who said they would vote for @entity2			1
the @entity36 said it conducted the poll sunday night			0
@entity2 , of the center - right @entity39 party , has been a significant figure on the @entity43 and international stages since becoming president in 2007			2
under his leadership , @entity3 has played key roles in international hot spots such as @entity48 and @entity49 , not to mention during the pan-european debt crisis , but the domestic economy has been a prime focus of the election			0
@entity3 is struggling in the face of sluggish economic growth and a 10 % unemployment rate			0
@entity7 generally supports " more government action to stimulate the economy " whereas @entity2 favors policies such as lowering some taxes and possibly repealing the mandatory 35 - hour limit on the work week , said @entity63 , who teaches a course about the election at the @entity66 in @entity67			1
@entity70 chancellor @entity69 , through spokesman @entity68 , expressed her support monday for @entity2 , but said she would work " closely and well with any elected @entity3 president			2
" @entity2 is pressing for three debates with @entity7 before the next round , accusing the @entity8 of " fleeing his responsibilities " by saying he wanted only one debate			1
@entity78 , an adviser to @entity7 , said sunday there would only be a single debate , on may 2			2
" there has always been one debate , and there 's no need for ( that ) to change , " she told @entity1			0
the far - right @entity19 , 43 , did not specifically direct her own supporters to rally behind or against anyone in the runoff , but on sunday night , she described @entity2 as " the outgoing president " and characterized her party as " the only opposition			2
" " we have never been as high as this , " she said , pointing to her showing			0
" this is only the beginning			0
let us continue to fight			0
" her @entity94 -- founded and , until last year , led by her father -- has been known for anti-euro , protectionist policies , its stringent positions on curbing immigration and other more right - wing stances that would appear to jibe more closely with the views of @entity2 than @entity7			1
yet @entity104 , a @entity19 adviser , accused @entity2 of breaking promises during his five years in office and said people " do not trust " him			2
he recommended that his candidate 's supporters " abstain " in the runoff			0
with all votes counted on monday , @entity7 had 28.63 % support , followed by @entity2 at 27.18 %			1
@entity19 garnered 17.9 % of the vote , while @entity114 on the extreme left had 11.11 % and centrist @entity116 had 9.13 %			0
the gap had tightened appreciably from earlier results , when @entity7 held a 6 - percentage - point lead with just less than half the votes counted			1
turnout was 79.47 % , officials said			0
that marks a drop from 2007 , when 84 % of the nation 's voters went to the polls , though key players from both @entity7 and @entity2 's camps described it as a " strong turnout " indicative of citizens ' high interest in the race			1
the results appeared to be historic , and a bad sign for @entity2			2
several high - profile @entity7 supporters told @entity1 that a @entity3 president running for re-election has never failed to place first in the first round of the vote			1
especially with neither of them close to a majority , who assumes the presidency hinges on what support @entity2 or @entity7 can get from those who did n't back them sunday			1
in his speech sunday night , @entity114 urged his supporters to " fight against @entity2 " -- noting that he 's not " asking for anything in exchange " from @entity7 for siding with him			1
" i 'm asking you not to drag your feet , " @entity114 told his backers			0
" i just ask you to mobilize			0
" one year ago , @entity7 was n't even considered by many as the @entity159 's best hope			0
that distinction belonged to then - @entity162 chief @entity161 , who polls suggested could challenge and possibly beat @entity2			2
but @entity161 's political prospects floundered in the wake of sexual assault charges -- later dropped -- after an incident at a @entity169 hotel , as well as accusations he participated in a prostitution ring in @entity3			0
that helped propel the 57 - year - old @entity7 , who has never formally held any national elected office , to become his party 's presidential choice			1
he is now aiming to become @entity3 's first left - wing leader since the late @entity178 left office in 1995			0
@entity3 trade and tourism minister @entity180 described @entity7 as " the choice of the past , " with other @entity2 backers playing up the fact that @entity178 did n't select him as one of his ministers during his 14 years as president , which ended in 1995			1
yet @entity7 adviser @entity78 said that @entity19 's strong showing suggested that @entity2 could n't get those more philosophically aligned with his views to support him , despite his " aggressive " efforts			1
that will leave the incumbent hard - pressed to unite all @entity3 , she said			0
" the people ... do n't trust @entity2 any more , " @entity78 said			0
@entity1 's @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 in @entity0 ; @entity200 and @entity201 in @entity202 , @entity3 ; @entity203 in @entity204 ; and @entity205 contributed to this report .			0
