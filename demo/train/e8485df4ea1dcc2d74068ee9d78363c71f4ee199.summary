@entity0 -- embattled @entity3 @entity2 gov. @entity2 , an anti-union darling of the tea party and other fiscal conservatives , faces off tuesday against @entity9 @entity8 mayor @entity7 in a high - stakes recall election that politicos say could foreshadow the contentious november general contest			1
recall vote is judgment day for @entity3 governor the fight to recall @entity2 after only an 18 - month tenure in office speaks to some in the blue - leaning state 's frustration over @entity24 - led efforts to keep unions in check			1
@entity2 and his @entity24 colleagues in the state legislature voted last january to restrict public employee unions ' collective bargaining rights and keep their raises -- except those of police and firefighters -- at inflation rates			2
protests and a union backlash ensued along with efforts to recall @entity2 from office			0
meet @entity2 : from the archives , watch gov. @entity2 in 2011 make his case : " we do n't have any more money			0
' @entity2 and his supporters argue that unions are making it difficult to take the steps needed to shrink the state 's mushrooming debt			0
unions and their supporters counter that collective bargaining has helped ensure safe working conditions , fair treatment and wages and adequate health care			0
the deeply polarized @entity3 recall race also pits @entity9 and their @entity60 allies against @entity24 and impassioned tea party supporters in a multi-million dollar showdown that 's drawn such political stars as former president @entity64 and sen. @entity65 , @entity66 , into the fray			1
a loss for either party in the close race could start a domino effect in swing states			0
as @entity1 's @entity73 pointed out monday in an analysis : if @entity2 sidesteps a recall , it would speak to conservative 's grassroots power , the waning power of unions -- which typically ally with @entity9 -- and could further @entity82 's efforts in the state			1
a @entity2 recall would mean conservatives were roundly chastised , the tea party suffered a blow and @entity88 has strong footing in @entity3 .			2

@entity3 votes on tuesday to recall gov. @entity2
the vote pits @entity9 and *big* unions against @entity24 and fiscal conservatives
the recall vote has taken on *national* *importance* for both parties
