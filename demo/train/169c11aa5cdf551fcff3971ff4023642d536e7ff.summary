@entity0 -- a judge in @entity0 has found former @entity6 oil tycoon @entity5 and his business partner guilty of corruption charges , his lawyer said monday			1
@entity5 's son , @entity9 , later told @entity1 that his father will appeal the verdict			1
" of course there will be an appeal , " @entity12 said			2
" what i 'm hoping for right now is the shortest sentence possible , because i 'm really hoping to see my dad as soon as possible a free man			0
" the trial on money laundering and embezzlement charges , which began in march 2009 , was the second for the two men			0
@entity5 could be sentenced to prison until 2017			1
" the trial was a charade of justice , the charges were absolutely false , but i fear the sentencing will be very real , " lead defense lawyer @entity25 said in a written statement			0
@entity5 , the former head of the @entity34 oil company , and his business partner , @entity35 , were charged with embezzlement and laundering of stolen property			1
they are accused of stealing billions of dollars ' worth of oil from @entity34 production subsidiaries from 1998 to 2003			1
@entity5 has already been convicted of underpaying taxes on the oil			1
ahead of the verdict , hundreds of supporters gathered outside the central @entity0 courthouse			0
security officers , who maintained a heavy presence outside the building , whisked several people away while others stood in below - freezing temperatures chanting " freedom " and " @entity6 without @entity55 " -- referring to the prime minister			0
@entity5 had expressed a desire to run for office at one time and funded opposition political parties			1
he has said the trial was part of a @entity63 campaign to destroy him and take the company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s			2
the @entity63 has denied any role			0
@entity12 said that he had been expecting a guilty verdict for his father , but also " had hoped that @entity74 ( @entity73 ) @entity72 's rhetoric about judicial system reform would actually bear some fruit			1
" " however , today , i realize that the judge is completely subservient and is a slave to the political will of @entity81 ( @entity6 prime minister @entity80 ) @entity55 and other bureaucrats in the @entity63 , " the younger @entity5 said			1
a @entity84 statement monday also criticized the case , saying it " appears to be an abusive use of the legal system for improper ends			1
" " the apparent selective application of the law to these individuals undermines @entity6 's reputation as a country committed to deepening the rule of law , " said the statement by @entity84 press secretary @entity90 ,			1
the statement added that the @entity98 would continue monitoring developments in the case			0
in a separate statement , @entity98 secretary of state @entity101 said the conviction " raises serious questions about selective prosecution -- and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations			0
" " this and similar cases have a negative impact on @entity6 's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate , " @entity109 's statement said			0
the court was originally scheduled to read the verdict in the trial on december 15 , but it was unexpectedly postponed			0
the @entity34 oil company was once @entity6 's largest oil producer			1
@entity5 is serving an eight - year sentence for fraud and tax evasion , having underpaid taxes on the oil his company produced			1
@entity34 was later broken up and absorbed by the state			2
@entity5 has already told the @entity0 court that its decision will have an impact far beyond him and @entity35			2
" there is much more than just the fates of two people in your hands , " @entity5 said			2
" right here and right now , the fate of every citizen of our country is being decided			0
" in october , prosecutors asked for a 14 - year prison sentence but said it should include the eight - year term that @entity5 is already serving , which will end in october 2011			2
with time served , the sentence could keep @entity5 in jail until 2017			2
the former oil magnate was previously incarcerated in a work camp near the town of @entity151 , 6,500 kilometers ( 4,000 miles ) from his native @entity0 , but when the new charges were brought against the two men , both were moved to @entity0 last year to stand trial			0
the court also ordered @entity5 and @entity35 to pay about $ 600 million in back taxes			2
few doubt that @entity5 's prosecution has taken on a symbolism far beyond his own innocence or guilt			1
critics say the embezzlement charges against him are absurd ; analysts say @entity6 itself , and its commitment to the rule of law , is on trial			0
" this verdict will be a verdict on whether @entity6 is a law - governed state , or whether it ever aspires to become one , " said @entity171 of the @entity172 , " because currently it is not a law - governed state and the trial of @entity5 and his partner @entity35 is the most striking example of it			1
" in his final address to the court , @entity5 made a last impassioned appeal			1
" for me , as for anybody , it is hard to live in jail , and i do not want to die there			0
but if i have to , i will not hesitate			0
the things i believe in are worth dying for , " he said			0
