-- taxes took center stage in renewed @entity4 attacks on the @entity7 administration 's sweeping health care legislation thursday after the @entity8 rebuffed attempts to derail it based on its constitutionality			1
using the court 's finding that the centerpiece of the law -- the individual mandate -- amounted to a legal exercise of congressional tax power became @entity20 for the @entity4			1
" that 's not what the president said when he introduced the bill , but what the court said was that it 's ok because it 's a tax , " @entity22 rep. @entity21 , @entity23 , told @entity0			0
" the debate that we 're happy to have is that our friends on the other side of the aisle [ not only ] want to tax what you do , they want to tax even what you do n't do			0
" ruling , tax fears play into campaign narrative for both sides and @entity44 @entity43 sen. @entity43 said , " millions of @entity22 may now have a @entity46 problem as a result of the ruling			0
" but @entity49 , a leading chronicler of the battle over health care , says that should n't be a surprise			1
the requirement that all adults have health coverage is the linchpin of the @entity59 , the health care legislation president @entity7 signed in 2010 after an epic brawl in @entity61			1
that rule survived its last legal challenge thursday when the @entity8 ruled it was constitutional under the legislative branch 's power to impose taxes			2
@entity7 had denied the mandate was a tax during a 2009 interview with @entity70 , comparing it to state requirements that motorists carry auto insurance			1
" nobody considers that a tax increase			0
people say to themselves , ' that is a fair way to make sure that if you hit my car , that i 'm not covering all the costs			0
' " what health reform could cost you at least four million people are expected to pay a tax penalty when the rule takes full effect in 2016 , bringing in about $ 54 billion to help offset the $ 1.7 trillion , 10 - year cost of the act , according to the nonpartisan @entity89			0
but it 's only one of several revenue - raising provisions that help pay for the costs of the act , commonly dubbed " @entity59			0
" " this was the @entity101 tax bill , " said @entity49 , a @entity96 political scientist and co-author of a 2010 book on the health care battle			1
in addition to the mandate , there is a higher @entity106 tax rate on taxpayers making more than $ 200,000 a year or $ 250,000 for married couples , and it added a tax on investment income to fund the federal health program for seniors			2
opinion : @entity8 's ruling a ' @entity115 ' " it 's one of those invisible things , and it 's very important , " @entity49 said			2
there 's also an excise tax on so - called " @entity123 " health plans , which had been hotly debated at the time ; a higher threshold on medical deductions ; and a 10 % excise tax on indoor tanning services			0
but while @entity4 have long opposed higher taxes , @entity49 said they concentrated their fire on the mandate instead			1
" rather than getting into a convoluted conversation about taxes that were pretty obscure to most people , they latched onto the individual mandate , " he said			1
" now that the @entity8 has up held the mandate , it 's really kind of taken the wind out of their sails			2
" @entity49 said most @entity22 will be covered by employee health plans , a head of household 's employer or by existing government programs such as @entity106 , @entity143 or veterans ' benefits			0
of the roughly 6 % of the population remaining , a large portion of those will be exempted from the mandate either because of poverty , religious belief or other reasons , he said			0
by the numbers : health insurance @entity8 on health care law : how they voted , what they wrote photos : who is @entity161 ? @entity0 's @entity162 contributed to this report .			1
