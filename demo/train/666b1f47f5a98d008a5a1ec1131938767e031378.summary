@entity0 , @entity1 -- members of the @entity4 decided thursday to formally lift sanctions on @entity6 , a spokeswoman for @entity4 secretary - general @entity8 said			1
@entity9 said the decision , made over dinner during the first day of a planned two - day summit in @entity0 , @entity1 , will be formally confirmed monday during an @entity4 council meeting			1
the diplomatic sanctions , which limited visits to the @entity17 island by senior @entity4 personnel , were imposed in 2003 after concerns were raised about human rights in @entity6			1
the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , so lifting them now could be considered a symbolic move			0
plans call for the human rights situation to be reviewed next year			0
the move was seen as an attempt to encourage @entity6 president @entity29 , who recently took the reins of power from his ailing brother , @entity32 , to make progress on civil rights , officials said			0
at least one @entity4 nation , @entity36 , had wanted to see more evidence of progress before taking the step but agreed to go along with the move			0
the @entity42 ' trade blockade on @entity6 , imposed almost 50 years ago , is not affected by the decision , but @entity45 spokesman @entity44 expressed disappointment over the move			1
" we think the @entity49 need to take a number of steps to improve the human rights conditions for ordinary @entity6 before any sanctions are lifted , " he said			2
@entity55 deputy spokesman @entity54 said earlier thursday that the @entity42 did not support such a move by the @entity4 and sees no reason to shift policy			2
" while we 've seen some very minor cosmetic changes made by this regime , we certainly do n't see any kind of fundamental break with the @entity29 dictatorship that would give us reason to believe that now would be the time to lift sanctions or otherwise fundamentally alter our policies , " @entity54 told reporters prior to the @entity4 's decision			2
" so certainly , we would not be supportive of the @entity4 or anyone else easing those restrictions at this time			0
