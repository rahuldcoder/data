-- @entity2 sen. @entity1 says she 's not seeking the @entity3			1
" i 'm not running for president and i plan to serve out my term , " @entity4 , who 's up for reelection in 2018 , said in december			1
but she sure is acting like a potential 2016 contender			1
she 's traveling around the country , introducing herself to voters , testing her message -- the sort of thing that candidates do			1
that 's what former secretary of state @entity16 is doing on her book tour			1
sen. @entity19 is on his ideas tour and gov. @entity21 is raising money for @entity24 governors			1
and like @entity25 , @entity4 now has an organized group supporting her and encouraging her to run			1
@entity28 also has a petition as well as a @entity31 campaign and a @entity33 feed to rally support			1
while @entity4 , a first - term senator and champion of the left , is becoming acquainted with a wider swath of @entity39 voters , @entity24 are taking notice , being proactive and preparing for a potential candidacy			1
@entity43 spokeswoman @entity42 said her organization has started to " build a narrative on her " in order to define her to voters before she can do that herself			0
" she appears to be seriously looking at a 2016 @entity3 run and we 're going to treat her as a contender , " @entity42 said			1
@entity4 's schedule has ramped up as the campaign season has			2
she has raised $ 2.6 million for @entity55 and gubernatorial candidates this cycle , according to her office			2
since march , the former @entity60 law professor has campaigned in @entity61 , @entity62 , and @entity63 for liberal colleagues who fall mostly in line with her ideology of increasing the minimum wage , decreasing the student loan burden , reforming mortgages and attacking @entity70			2
going where few liberals will go @entity4 catapulted onto the national scene during the financial crisis as a consumer advocate			0
@entity24 opposition kept her from running the agency created around her cause , the @entity81			1
but her popularity among the left helped her win the @entity55 seat in 2012			0
but @entity4 has also gone where many liberals wo n't -- to the most conservative states in the country			2
she campaigned for @entity55 @entity39 candidates @entity90 in @entity91 and @entity92 in @entity93			1
@entity1 bashes @entity70 in @entity93 " @entity92 and i do not agree on everything , " @entity4 said monday at a rally for @entity92 in @entity93			0
" but on the core issues , on the issues that are about our values , on the issues that define us as human beings , @entity101 and i agree			0
our job is to fight for the families of @entity105			0
" republicans , meanwhile , were quick to attack her and her message			0
the @entity43 called @entity4 's visit to @entity93 " one of the more bizarre campaign moves of 2014 " because @entity4 's " far left agenda " wo n't sit well with @entity113			2
in the @entity4 playbook , it 's not so bizarre			2
in the red states of @entity93 and @entity91 , which voted for president @entity118 36 % and 38 % , respectively , and where the candidates are running away from the president , the arguably more liberal @entity4 received an exceptional reception			1
a " long line " waited to see her in @entity91 and a crowd of nearly 400 enthusiastically welcomed her in @entity93			0
' she represents and speaks for so many in our party ' @entity39 strategist @entity127 called @entity4 " a perfect surrogate " this campaign season for areas in which @entity118 is too divisive to enter			0
" @entity4 has captured not only the spirit of the @entity39 this political cycle but she represents and speaks for so many in our party , " @entity127 said			0
@entity4 's name comes up even when she 's not in the room			2
at the @entity139 's convention in june , rep. @entity137 told the crowd that he wishes @entity144 could " trade @entity143 to @entity2 for @entity1			2
" as @entity4 's reception has been strong , she has modified her response since her emphatic december statement that she is not running for president			1
in an interview with @entity150 in june , @entity4 dodged answering the question , instead saying , " this is a moment in time for our country and , i believe , for our world , a moment in time where we decide who we are as a people and what kind of a future we 're going to build			0
" in the latest national polling , @entity4 trails far behind fellow potential contender @entity16			2
but with 11 % support among @entity39 , according to a july @entity164 , she is in second place			0
@entity24 think she 's ambitious			1
" contrary to saying it publicly , she appears to be aiming for higher office , " @entity24 strategist @entity166 said			1
@entity169 , the executive director of @entity170 , which gathers opposition research against @entity39 candidates , said @entity4 's aggressive campaigning has gotten his group engaged			1
" if @entity4 does decide to start leaning forward , we 're certainly going to be prepared to combat that , " @entity169 said			0
already , the @entity24 have attacked her not only for campaigning in conservatives states but also independently as well			1
for instance , in an effort to highlight government spending , the group said @entity4 's " brainchild , " the @entity81 , which was created during the financial crisis to protect consumers ' financial interests , cost more to build than @entity186			0
' headed to more friendly territory ' but as she is finding a receptive audience wherever she goes , @entity4 's campaigning is not going to let up			0
from the conservative confines of @entity93 , her next stop is in more comfortable territory			0
she heads to @entity195 at the end of this week to raise money and campaign with @entity55 candidate @entity198 and will also be the star of the liberal grassroots conference @entity201			0
@entity202 said her strategy to go into conservative states where she might receive a bold reception from some in the @entity39 base , the more moderate or conservative voters will be turned off			0
while he questioned her strategy , calling it " odd , " @entity202 tried to stir the pot among @entity39			0
" if you 're @entity16 's people , you 're looking at how sincere her words were " that she 's not running for president			1
@entity1 : what happened to the middle class ? @entity0 's @entity216 contributed to this report .			0
