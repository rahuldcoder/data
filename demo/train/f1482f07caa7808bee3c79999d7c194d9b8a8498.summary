-- @entity1 has withdrawn two mobile ballistic missiles from a launch site in the eastern part of the country , according to a @entity7 official , the latest hint of an easing in tensions on the @entity11			1
the disclosure came monday , the day before president @entity13 is due to meet with his @entity15 counterpart , @entity14 , in @entity16			2
during a fraught period last month that included near daily @entity1 threats of war , @entity7 and @entity15 officials said they believed @entity22 's regime could carry out a test launch of at least one of the missiles at any time			1
the @entity7 and @entity26 responded by stepping up missile defenses in the region			0
but the anniversary of the birth of @entity1 's founder on april 15 , seen as the likely date around which a launch could take place , came and went without either of the missiles being fired			1
and now they have been sent to a storage facility , the @entity7 official said			1
the missiles the @entity1 has moved from the launch site are believed to be @entity41 , an untested weapon that the @entity15 government says has a maximum range of 3,500 kilometers ( 2,175 miles )			1
that would mean the missiles could reach as far as @entity26 and @entity47 , a @entity49 territory that is home to @entity7 naval and air bases			1
more tests will take @entity1 closer to nuclear missile , @entity52 says recent tensions the recent period of tensions flared up after the @entity1 's long - range rocket launch in december and underground nuclear test in february , both of which were widely condemned			0
@entity63 's fiery rhetoric intensified in march as the @entity64 voted to tighten sanctions on the regime following the nuclear test			0
annual @entity7 - @entity15 military drills in @entity15 also fueled the @entity1 's anger , especially when the @entity7 carried out displays of strength that included nuclear - capable @entity73 stealth bombers			1
but a key part of the large - scale training exercises , known as @entity76 , concluded last week , and the intensity of @entity63 's threats appears to have subsided			1
its rhetorical exchanges with @entity16 and @entity81 have shifted to include conditions for possible negotiations , although both sides appear to remain far apart			0
@entity1 is demanding recognition as a nuclear power , something the @entity7 refuses to countenance			2
and the recent crisis resulted in the closure of the @entity90 , the last major symbol of @entity93 cooperation			0
analysts and @entity7 officials have cautioned that @entity22 's regime remains unpredictable and that tensions could escalate again in the event of new provocations			0
it would be " premature " to make a judgment about whether the @entity1 " provocation cycle is going up , down or zig - zagging , " @entity102 , @entity103 special assistant and senior director for @entity106 affairs , said monday			0
" no one should be prepared to declare a victory yet , " he said , referring to the reports of the missiles being moved off the launch site			0
last remaining @entity15 leave joint industrial complex a fresh warning from the @entity1 a reminder of the fragile situation came in a @entity1 statement tuesday that accused @entity7 and @entity15 forces of carrying out naval shelling drills near the two @entity122 ' disputed western maritime border			1
the statement , from the @entity125 's command in the sector near that part of the border , warned of " immediate counteractions " if " even a single shell " from the drills fell within its territorial waters			0
but the statement was notably free of the talk of " nuclear war " that peppered @entity1 propaganda directed at the @entity7 and @entity15 during the height of the tensions in march and april			1
at a news briefing in @entity81 , @entity141 , a spokesman for the @entity15 defense ministry , denied the @entity1 's accusation that shelling drills had been taking place in the sea near the border since sunday			1
he confirmed , though , that planned annual naval drills to practice the defense of islands near the border were under way			2
in november 2010 , @entity1 shelled the @entity15 island of @entity156 , killing two @entity15 marines and two civilians			2
@entity63 accused @entity81 of provoking the attack by holding a military drill in the area			0
the current situation regarding @entity1 is chief among the subjects on the agenda for @entity13 and @entity166 's meeting on tuesday			0
@entity13 will use @entity166 's visit to " reaffirm the strong commitment " of the @entity7 to the defense of @entity15 , @entity102 said monday			2
@entity0 's @entity170 and @entity171 , and journalist @entity166 contributed to this report .			0
