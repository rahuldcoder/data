-- for the first time @entity2 stores will soon let iphone owners trade in their old phones for credit toward a new one , according to multiple reports			1
according to @entity2 - centric blog @entity10 , several sources say @entity2 store employees are currently being trained on the new program , which could go into effect around @entity2 's september 10 event , when new iphones are expected to be introduced			1
that would let @entity19 owners exchange their older handsets for an @entity21 , or whatever the new phone is called			2
in june , @entity23 quoted unnamed sources saying that @entity2 was working with recycling company @entity25 and that trade - ins could be refurbished by @entity2 and resold in emerging markets throughout the world			1
during @entity2 's most recent earnings call , ceo @entity29 said he was " not opposed " to in - store trade - ins			1
" i see channels doing it , and i like the environmental aspect of it , and so that part of it really is encouraging to me , " he said			0
the " channels " he referred to are third - party vendors of @entity2 products , such as @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			2
the blog @entity45 says some @entity2 stores , including several in @entity47 , @entity48 , already are running a limited pilot program			2
according to the reports , people who bring in an older phone , like an @entity19 or @entity52 would get a gift card that could be applied to an @entity55			0
presumably , the 5 would be added to the list of phones that can be traded in for a discount on the next @entity19			0
it 's not clear whether earlier models , such as an @entity61 or @entity62 , would be eligible for trade - ins , although given their limited resale value that seems unlikely			1
@entity2 already has a similar mail - in rebate program			2
but the convenience of doing so in person , and walking out with a new phone instead of waiting for days or weeks , would be a big upgrade in terms of convenience			0
if recent history is any guide , @entity2 's next @entity19 will go on sale in mid- to late september and will likely to be called either the @entity19 6 or @entity21			1
the company has not made an official announcement , but multiple observers expect @entity2 to announce the phone september 10 and begin selling it in stores about 10 days later			1
the company has released a new @entity19 model every year , and the release dates have all been in the summer or fall			0
the @entity55 came out in september 2012 , the @entity52 in october 2011 , and the three versions before that in the summer months			0
the company is also rumored to be working on a cheaper version of the @entity19 that would be sold in emerging markets			0
other reports have speculated on features ranging from a larger , 4.7 - inch display screen to a fingerprint scanner to an option to buy a gold iphone .			0

@entity2 reportedly *launching* an @entity19 trade - in program
