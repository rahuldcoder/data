-- for the first time in several weeks , authorities have released information about missing @entity4 not previously available to the public			1
the problem is , it 's very technical and experts said it 's going to take them weeks to figure out exactly what it means			1
on tuesday the @entity12 authorities published a 47 - page document containing hundreds of lines of communication logs between the airliner that went missing march 8 and @entity18 , a @entity19 satellite telecommunications company			1
is there anything in the data we did n't already know ? the data is dense and complicated , and even professionals will need time to analyze the logs , experts tell @entity0			1
but there is some key general information that has emerged			0
the data includes the seven " handshakes " investigators said helped them conclude that the plane ended its flight in the southern @entity34 , where the search continues			1
" handshake " is the lingo that @entity18 uses			0
it means a signal between the satellite and the plane			1
the satellite sends a coded signal to the plane essentially asking " are you there ? " and the plane sends a signal conveying " i am here			1
" remember it was @entity12 authorities who , in late march , told relatives of the 239 passengers and crew that the aircraft crashed in the southern @entity34			0
the @entity12 government 's decided to release the data now , said @entity18 ceo @entity60 on @entity0 's " @entity61			2
" the data constitutes " raw communications logs over our networks , " he said			1
" that 's all the information that we have that passed between our network and the plane during the fateful hours when the flight was lost , " @entity60 said			2
" so it 's everything -- we put everything out there			0
" speaking of handshakes , what 's this about a ' partial handshake ' ? @entity18 and @entity78 officials have addressed something they call a " margin of error " -- or how far the plane could be from the location where authorities believe it crashed			2
the focus of the search has been the so - called seventh arc , which represents the location of a " partial handshake			2
" authorities believe that area is where the plane ran out of fuel			2
when it ran out of fuel , the plane 's on - board satellite communications system stopped , and the " partial handshake " was the battery - powered communication 's equipment powering up following a power interruption , authorities said			1
@entity99 , the head of the @entity78 agency coordinating the search , first suggested at a press conference in early april that may have happened			0
you 've said it 's going to take time -- how long exactly ? an international group of experts is reviewing the data from @entity18 and examining an analysis of the plane 's performance -- and that enterprise could take two to three more weeks , @entity107 chief commissioner @entity106 told @entity0 tuesday			1
on top of that , it 's possible that continuing to review the data will further refine or even shift the search area from its current location , @entity106 told @entity0			2
it 's not just people involved in the search saying that			0
even @entity125 , founder of @entity126 , a member of a loose confederation of experts who 've demanded access to the information , said the information released tuesday is too limited to verify @entity18 's conclusion that the plane flew south , into the @entity34			1
he joined the chorus of others who called for more time			0
but do n't the @entity78 , the leaders of the search , have anything more to say ? for the first time , @entity78 accident investigators outlined in a detailed report why they believe the plane crashed in the southern @entity34			2
the report , posted monday on the @entity107 's website , includes a map with seven concentric circles representing the " seven handshakes " captured in the @entity18 data			2
this is where aviation experts -- who call themselves av geeks -- can begin their inside baseball debate			0
to start them off -- the @entity78 ' report explains two key measurements : the first , the @entity158 ( @entity159 ) , which allowed investigators to figure out how far away the plane was from the satellite at the time of each " handshake			0
" the second , the @entity165 ( @entity166 ) , which helped investigators estimate the speed and direction of the aircraft , which led to the conclusion that @entity4 flew into the southern @entity34			1
you 've probably seen family members on the news , outraged at the @entity12 government , accusing officials of not being transparent during the investigation			0
how are relatives reacting to the release of this data ? " it is very technical and we are not experts , so we may ask some other people who can help us , " said @entity181 on @entity0 tuesday			1
his mother was a passenger			0
@entity186 , partner of @entity188 passenger @entity187 , told @entity0 's " @entity61 " that she believes @entity12 authorities have more information they 're not releasing			0
she suggested that the @entity12 government received the data from @entity18 and manipulated it before releasing it to the public			0
" they 're clearly covering something up , " she said			0
" now , whether they 're covering up their own incompetence or they 're covering up wrongdoing or they 're covering up on behalf of somebody else , for instance another more powerful government , it could be any of those scenarios			0
" she said that the families have reached out to their own hired experts who are analyzing the data , but that it is too soon to tell if they can draw any conclusions .			1
