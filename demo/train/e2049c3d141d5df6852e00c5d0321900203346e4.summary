after it received a rapturous reception in @entity21 , he took " @entity108 " to @entity30 in 2003 , where he performed it in front of @entity114			0
@entity1 has described that triumphant homecoming as the highlight of his career			2
never one to shirk from a challenge , he traveled to @entity119 to perform the lead in " @entity121 " with the @entity122 , a notoriously demanding and exhausting role			0
he often speaks of the need for ballet to take risks , to evolve and to speak a contemporary language -- ideals that @entity1 embodies			1

once you do that it lives on forever			0
