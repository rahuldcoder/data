this is @entity0 ! first up : meeting with business @entity29 : first up , president @entity30 and business : can they work together ? the president has not had the best relationship with business leaders , specifically with the @entity37 @entity36			1
the group was against the health care and @entity41 reform laws that the president pushed for and passed			1
and the @entity36 supported a lot of @entity45 candidates in last year 's midterm elections			1
the @entity37 @entity36 is the country 's largest business organization			1
it represents 3 million businesses from all across the @entity37 and its main purpose is to work on behalf of those businesses , especially in @entity51			1
during his speech to the 200 members of the @entity36 yesterday , president @entity30 acknowledged the tension between them			1
but he says he 's convinced that they can and must work together			1
one thing that both sides want : more jobs			2
the president promised that he 'll work on programs and policies , like spending money on education and improving transportation networks , that would help the country 's businesses and would help get the economy back on track			1
economy in @entity71 @entity29 : things are moving forward in @entity4			1
the country 's new cabinet had its first meeting yesterday			1
there are some protesters still out in the streets , saying they 're not gon na budge until president @entity79 steps down			1
@entity79 has said he wo n't run for re-election in september			2
we 've talked a lot about what all this political upheaval could mean for @entity4 's government in the future			1
@entity87 is looking at what it means for @entity4 's economy right now			1
( begin video ) @entity93 , @entity94 correspondent : as anti-mubarak protesters remain entrenched in @entity99 's @entity98 , the effects of the uprising are visible nationwide			1
this is @entity101 , a massive real estate development outside @entity4 's capital with 1,500 housing units under construction			1
owner @entity106 says work has come to a virtual standstill since the protests began			2
@entity110 , president , @entity112 : we had to slow down because we could not get the materials in time , most of the laborers could not come			1
now , we are starting to organize ourselves to go back to work			0
maybe $ 4 - $ 5 million of losses per month at least			0
@entity119 : @entity106 says if things do n't improve , he might have to start laying off workers			0
one bank estimates this crisis is costing @entity4 more than $ 300 million a day as the economy remains in a state of paralysis			1
@entity4 's economy is losing a lot of money every day and business people fear the long - term consequences could be grave , as investors lose their confidence and tourists start choosing other destinations			1
many business sectors are affected , some only now coming back to life			1
as shop owners slowly began opening their doors on @entity99 's streets on sunday , banks serviced customers for this first time since the beginning of the crisis			1
to prevent the masses from pulling their cash out of the institutions , private withdrawals were limited to $ 10,000 or 50,000 @entity4 pounds			1
despite long lines , most appeared calm			0
@entity154 [ @entity155 ] : " there are a lot of people who are withdrawing money because banks were closed in the last few days , " this man says			0
" many people are withdrawing money			0
" @entity119 : @entity106 says though the fallout from the uprising is seriously hurting his business interests , he understands the anti-government protesters			1
@entity167 : i have personal sympathy for them			0
i think there was corruption , it is a time of change			0
but my personal view is that we should give the people that are in charge now that are trying to clean up and put this country together a chance			1
@entity119 : but it does n't seem like the anti-government protesters are willing to give the current government that chance			0
as many @entity4 fight for social change , many workers on construction sites like this one are fighting and praying to keep their jobs			1
@entity190 , @entity0 , @entity99 , @entity4			1
( @entity191 ) @entity192 @entity29 : to the south of @entity4 is @entity5 , a country that 's about to be split in half -- literally			1
in a referendum last month , nearly 99 percent of southern @entity195 voted to split from the north and form their own country			1
@entity5 's @entity200 fought a war against each other for more than two decades			1
the peace treaty that ended that conflict led to this vote			0
the country 's president has said he 'll accept the results of the election , so @entity5 could become the world 's newest nation by this summer			1
this day in history @entity29 : it 's february 8th			1
this day in history : in 1910 , the @entity214 was founded by @entity215			0
he was inspired after being helped by a @entity217 scout when he got lost in @entity219			0
is this legit ? @entity220 , @entity13 : is this legit ? the symptoms of a concussion can include nausea , dizziness and memory problems			0
and anyone who 's gotten one of these brain injuries is more likely to get another one			1
protecting @entity232 athletes @entity29 : concussions are pretty common in contact sports like football			2
at the @entity238 level , there are around 100 concussions every year			2
but when you look at the number of teens and younger kids who go to the er for sports - related concussions , that number jumps to more than 100,000 ! doctor @entity247 shows us how one program uses prevention and preparation to address the problem			2
( begin video ) @entity247 , @entity254 : most of these players see themselves as mini-versions of these guys			2
@entity259 , president , sports legacy institute : youth football is trying to be the professional game , sometimes for good , but sometimes for bad			2
@entity264 : the good ? competition			0
and the ugly ? a tendency trickling down from the pros to hide head injuries			0
@entity271 : when you are 13 , you have the same drives to play through pain , play through injury - not wanting to look weak in front of your friends or weak in front of your enemies			0
guys went great lengths to hide injuries or not talk about them			0
@entity264 : it turns out hiding has consequences , first seen at the @entity238 level			0
retired players consumed with depression , rage , memory problems			2
their symptoms associated with the mysterious brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy			0
it looks like dementia , but it strikes players in their 30s , 40s and 50s , sometimes younger			2
@entity271 : the reality is , we do have cases of teenagers having the disease			0
we 're primary football players			2
some play multi-sports , but they all had brain trauma			0
@entity306 , president , @entity308 : well , it 's brain damage			1
i mean , that 's what it comes down to			2
how can you want that for any child ? does your head go up or down ? team : up ! @entity319 : @entity320 goes up or down ? team : up ! @entity319 : let 's go ! @entity264 : @entity322 coaches the @entity323			2
it 's a team of fifth graders in @entity326 , @entity327			2
last year , he had a typical playbook			0
@entity319 : we do drills like bull in the ring , you know , one kid 's in the middle and you walk around and tap a kid , and then you just go at it , head - to - head , hammer to hammer			2
@entity264 : and during games ? @entity319 : the kid came out and he got a hard hit , what we used to call a stinger or a ding , you know			0
we would sit there and say , " hey , are you ok ? " and then send him back in if he answered yes			0
@entity264 : when his team clocked 20 concussions in one season , coach @entity352 said enough			1
his new playbook starts with a concussion course for coaches , parents and players ; a trainer at games and practice			2
@entity364 : do you have any nausea or dizziness ? @entity154 : no. @entity264 : and far less hitting in practice ; an emphasis on technique , not brute force			0
@entity319 : this is what we do n't want to see			0
ok ? the spine is lined up			0
@entity264 : the impact ? the @entity323 cut the number of concussions in half and still made the playoffs			2
@entity271 : it did not hurt the kids ' ability to play the game			0
it just dramatically lowered their injury rate and their head trauma rate			0
and so , when you look at how simple those things were made in one season , in one program , you wonder why is n't everybody else doing this ? ( @entity191 ) @entity392 @entity29 : good info there			0
now , you heard today 's show dedicated to some of our @entity16 fans			1
if you love our show and you 're on @entity16 , show us some like ! @entity320 over to @entity16 / @entity401 and click the " like " button			0
we 'd like that a lot			0
before we go @entity29 : we might have bitten off more than we can chew with today 's before we go story			1
but at least we 're in good company			0
all of these ingredients combine to make this ! the @entity409 ! six hamburger patties ; 12 pieces of bacon ; six fried eggs ; all the usual fixin 's ; plus jalapenos and peanut butter ! if you have n't eaten lunch yet , you might not want to			2
this thing takes up the entire grill just to make a @entity409			0
and more than 60 people have tried and failed to take it down			0
goodbye @entity29 : but for the valiant effort , they deserve a patty on the back			0
after looking at the bun - dle of food , we want to know what you would include on your extreme burger			0
you can talk to us about your recipes at @entity16 / @entity401			0
we 'll see you again tomorrow .			0
