@entity0 -- @entity3 authorities late thursday forcibly evacuated hundreds of @entity5 demonstrators from a recently created camp			1
the actions thursday night into friday followed what the @entity8 , an activist group , described as an " @entity11 siege " of their encampment in @entity13			0
located in the central @entity15 not far from @entity16 , @entity14 was hatched a week ago by @entity5 activists on @entity19 land that belongs to the @entity20			2
a spokesman for the @entity22 said authorities moved in -- after having given ample warning to the demonstrators " to independently evacuate " -- " due to rock hurling earlier this week at the main @entity15 route and other legal considerations			1
" " the agitators were evacuated , " according to the military spokesman , by @entity3 troops , border guard personnel and police			1
video of the raid aired on @entity35 showed hundreds of @entity3 troops and police entering @entity38 on foot			1
dr. @entity40 , an independent @entity5 lawmaker who heads a medical relief group , said he saw bulldozers and other vehicles accompany the @entity3 authorities into the camp using stun grenades and physically manhandling those inside , including women and children			2
at least 24 people -- including at least one with broken ribs -- needed medical treatment for their injuries , @entity40 told @entity1 early friday			0
the @entity8 later tweeted that 35 people were being cared for -- some of them in intensive care -- at a hospital in @entity16 , which is about 24 kilometers ( 15 miles ) east of @entity0			0
the @entity5 activist group claimed that before the forced evacuation , @entity3 forces had cut off water pipes into @entity38 five times over two days and targeted vehicles carrying food and water			1
the group said that " local and international solidarity groups ( visited ) the village , " as did members of various @entity5 organizations , six @entity70 diplomats and @entity20 archbishop @entity20 , who " declared his full support			0
" " our will is strong and we will return , " said @entity40 , vowing that activists would return to the site soon			0
this incident is n't the first time that @entity3 authorities have forced out @entity5 activists who have hastily and defiantly set up such tent cities			1
in january 2013 , for instance , hundreds of @entity3 police swarmed such a makeshift camp in part of the @entity19 -- called @entity87 by protesters and dubbed @entity89 by @entity3 -- over @entity3 's settlement activity there			2
