-- @entity1 disappeared five years ago , but the suspicions and fears she harbored about her husband haunted his murder trial and proved crucial in his conviction			1
her words came to life through two crucial witnesses who conveyed @entity1 's remarks to jurors			1
that 's hearsay evidence , or what one person tells another outside a courtroom setting			1
the allowance of that evidence could possibly form the basis of an appeal by attorneys for former suburban @entity24 police sgt. @entity22 , 56 , who was found guilty thursday of the 2004 killing of ex-wife @entity26			2
@entity1 's words and her husband 's conviction could also mean that he could face a new murder trial -- this time for the death of @entity1 herself			1
" @entity1 , you are now next for justice , " @entity34 's brother @entity33 said after the verdict was read			1
@entity34 was @entity1 's third wife ; @entity1 , his fourth			1
@entity1 vanished in october 2007 , but her body has never been found			1
she left three children behind at home , and her family believes she was killed			0
but before @entity1 can be charged again , prosecutors would have to prove that @entity1 is dead and then that she was murdered			1
" the longer someone is gone , the easier it is to prove they have n't just run away and that they are deceased , " said @entity45 , the prosecutor in @entity46 , southwest of @entity24			0
" october 28 , 2007 , is in our rearview mirror now , " he said			2
" we are going to look at that case and assess it as it stands today , and if we feel confident in going forward , we will be doing so			0
" @entity1 once fueled outrage in the media with his brash behavior and flippant remarks about his wife 's disappearance			1
but thursday , he sat stone - faced in court as the verdict was read and returned to his jail cell as a murderer with little public sympathy			0
his case , however , could live on in the court system for years			0
critical moments from the @entity22 trial " you know what they say , a conviction is a first step in a successful appeal , " said @entity71 , @entity1 's lawyer			1
" believe me , there 's several world - class appellate lawyers just waiting to get their teeth into this			1
" an appeal could be based on a number of issues , including potential prosecutorial misconduct			0
but at the heart of the @entity1 trial controversy is the court 's allowance of @entity1 's disturbing comments , which jurors said were " extremely critical " to reaching the guilty verdict			1
jurors heard what she had said through the testimony of two key witnesses : the rev. @entity97 , @entity1 's pastor , and @entity99 , @entity34 's former divorce lawyer			1
@entity97 testified that @entity1 told him she woke up in the middle of the night -- the same night that @entity34 was killed -- and noticed her husband was not in bed			1
" after that , it was some time later , in the early morning hours , " @entity97 said			0
" she saw him standing near the washer and dryer , dressed in all black , carrying a bag			0
she said that he removed his clothing , and then took the contents of the bag and put all of that into the washing machine			0
" @entity97 said @entity1 told him that @entity22 told her he had killed @entity34 and then coached her to lie to police about it			1
and she did , @entity97 said			0
juror @entity116 said friday that the jury was troubled that police interviewed @entity1 while @entity22 was present			2
@entity99 testified that @entity1 planned to divorce @entity22 and wanted to know if " the fact that he killed @entity122 could be used against him " as leverage			2
just days after that phone call with @entity99 , @entity1 disappeared			1
her statements would be struck down in most courts of law : in 2004 , the @entity129 @entity128 ruled that hearsay violates a defendant 's @entity132 right to confront a witness testifying against him or her			1
but @entity135 passed a special law in 2008 that allows such hearsay evidence in rare instances when prosecutors believe a person was killed to prevent his or her testimony			1
the law quickly became known as " @entity22 's law			0
" defense attorneys argued that it was unconstitutional			2
they said it unfairly targeted @entity22 because it was passed after the case had already made national headlines			0
" he is absolutely innocent , " @entity71 said of @entity1 after thursday 's verdict , adding that his client was convicted " based almost entirely on hearsay			1
" @entity154 , a former prosecutor in @entity24 who attended parts of the @entity1 trial , said the hearsay evidence was key			1
" that was exactly the turning point when the prosecution hit their stride , " she told @entity158			0
" @entity1 's voice came in , and everyone knew she was gone and that @entity22 was a murderer			1
" you could see it on the jury 's face , " she said			0
@entity34 was found dead in her bathtub on march 1 , 2004			0
her hair was wet , but the tub was clean and dry			0
@entity34 's killing did not garner much publicity until @entity1 went missing and investigators began looking again into the circumstances			1
they exhumed @entity34 's body , re-examined it and issued a second report on her death			0
@entity34 , it said , was murdered			0
@entity1 was arrested and charged in may 2009 with first - degree murder			2
his lawyers argued her death was accidental -- that she fell , hit her head and drowned			0
but jurors said friday that they believed doctors who testified otherwise ; that @entity34 's injuries were not consistent with a bathroom mishap			1
jurors never saw any physical evidence connecting @entity1 to @entity34 's death			1
nor was there testimony placing him at the crime scene			0
but they heard what @entity1 said			2
the jury of seven men and five women deliberated for nearly 14 hours before reaching their verdict			0
when the panel adjourned for the night wednesday , the jury was 11 - 1 in favor of a guilty verdict , juror @entity201 told reporters			0
he was the holdout and said it was @entity97 and @entity99 's testimony about what @entity1 had said that finally swayed him			1
" the hearsay evidence was big , " he told @entity0 affiliate @entity212			1
" it seemed all the evidence was pointing toward the defendant being guilty			0
" jury foreman @entity217 said friday the testimony of @entity97 and @entity99 played a big part in the jurors ' decision			0
@entity97 said he was " hugely honored to be able to give @entity1 a voice			2
" " the jury did the right thing , " he said			0
" and justice is coming for @entity1 's family , too			1
it 's going to happen			0
" @entity1 was married to @entity34 in 2001 when he had an affair with then - 17 - year - old @entity229 , who eventually became his fourth wife			2
@entity34 and @entity1 filed for divorce in october 2001			2
their relationship was contentious in the years following , and a legal battle ensued over the division of common property			0
a court was about to make a ruling in which @entity34 was expected to receive part of @entity1 's pension and other support			1
but @entity34 died before the decision			0
@entity1 is set to be sentenced in late november			2
@entity135 no longer has the death penalty			2
@entity1 faces a maximum of 60 years in prison			2
the @entity1 trial : your questions answered			2

new : jurors say hearsay evidence was critical in @entity1 's conviction
@entity1 disappeared in 2007 and is believed dead
but her disturbing statements are presented in court through witnesses
defense lawyers argue hearsay is unconstitutional but @entity135 made it legal in certain cases
