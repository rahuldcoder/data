-- @entity1 smells like eucalyptus and lemongrass for the farmers of @entity5			2
the @entity6 co-operative is a producer of essential oils , with ambitious plans to reconstruct communities still scarred by genocide			1
this month will see the launch of @entity5 's designer scent " @entity15 " in upscale @entity16 of @entity17 , as well as many of the world 's leading department stores , making its debut alongside the offerings of @entity22 and @entity23			1
this dream comes true courtesy of @entity27 entrepreneur @entity26 , for whom it is all in a day 's work			1
she is the founder of " 7 virtues , " an enterprise with the rare mission of producing exotic , luxury fragrances of uncompromising quality , and also building successful businesses in the most devastated regions of the world			1
" we are up against giants and we should n't really exist , " @entity26 admits happily			0
" but you just have to follow your gut and hope that people will connect with what you 're doing			0
" personal journey the mission has been deeply personal from the outset for the ex-journalist , which began after a near - fatal ax attack on a serviceman friend in @entity50 that made her determined to find a way of supporting development in the country			1
she found it in @entity57 , a @entity59 supplier of oils , on the verge of quitting under pressure from the @entity63			0
@entity26 extended her credit card to its limit to buy a single cup of orange blossom for $ 2,000 , and via a @entity27 perfumer released the first bottles in a few local stores			1
an appearance on entrepreneurial reality tv show @entity71 secured her publicity , investment and a long - term business mentor in philanthropist @entity76 , enabling her to scale up production			0
four years later , 7 virtues has produced fragrances from @entity50 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , and now @entity6			1
@entity26 's line is carried in the boutique stores of @entity85 and @entity86 , and airlines such as @entity88			1
she has been named one of @entity27 's most powerful women and her reputation has grown to the point that @entity93 invited her on a development trip to @entity80			1
giving back to local economies the business has also delivered for her suppliers , with an estimated $ 250,000 reaching these local economies			0
@entity57 's distillery in @entity59 has found new buyers and now employs several thousands in harvest season , with knock - on improvements in local infrastructure and education			1
government funding has boosted the business further , as perfume oils are recognized as viable alternative crops to the poppy			0
" @entity112 has become our ambassador , " says dr. @entity110 , founder of the @entity111			0
" i have already received a request for oil because of the story of @entity118			0
" @entity120 to @entity26 's approach is the insistence this is business not charity			1
" it 's not even philanthropy , " she says			1
" i need my suppliers and they need me , so we are equal			0
that 's what separates us from other companies that will donate a dollar for a cause ... i was raised in poverty and i know enterprise is the solution , not charity			1
" surprisingly , operating from some of the most dangerous parts of the world has not negatively affected the business			2
" people say it 's a risky supply chain , and i always buy a little extra to be sure , but we have never had a problem			2
@entity145 run the most dangerous routes in the world			2
i have more problems with our local shipping networks			0
" @entity26 credits persistence and belief for the company 's success -- " forgetting the people that say no. " she has been happy to sacrifice , forgoing a salary to constantly reinvest in order to compete in the elite fragrance world , supplementing her income through a bestselling book about her experiences			1
she works long hours researching potential supply sources , and is prepared to fly across the world for a meeting			2
she has also been forced to confront constant risk and rejection , and even the possibility of oblivion , in a cut - throat industry in which most new companies do n't survive the first year			0
the ethical choice but the 7 virtues have unique selling points , informed by the production process , that enable them to position their fragrances as the transparent , ethical choice , with more than a trace of feminism			0
" we do n't use skinny models , movie stars or expensive imagery , just the farmers ' stories and their oils with no added chemicals , " says @entity26			0
" people who ca n't wear most fragrances can wear ours because of the composition			0
" " i have never been comfortable going to a beauty counter because i never felt airbrushed or thin enough - that 's scarier for me than @entity80 or @entity6			1
so i 'm happy to be sharing something that does n't impose upon women or make them feel they need to be externally beautiful in the way that airbrushed imagery tells us to be			0
we want to change the model at home too , to make the beauty counter a place women that can feel empowered			2
" the entrepreneur is aware that the finest of ethical credentials would fall flat without an elite product , so she does not compromise on quality and the fragrances ' growing popularity suggests they compete on their own terms			2
@entity26 still has grand plans			0
@entity213 and @entity214 are among the targets for future scents , and she hopes to deepen her involvement in international development efforts with leading organizations and public figures , to lend her insight to making support for local economies count			2
but her primary ambition now is about taking business to the next level and making it pay			0
" we have gone from thriving to surviving and now i want to prove this business model works			2
each year we make more money , and its time to ramp it up now and show people that social enterprise can pay dividends			1
