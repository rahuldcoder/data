@entity0 -- the @entity2 is seeking records from more than two dozen @entity5 offices around the nation about the " collection and use of race and ethnicity data in local communities , " according to a press release issued by the civil liberties group			1
the @entity2 is concerned about @entity5 practices allowed by its 2008 " @entity15 " that would permit the bureau to collect information and map racial and ethnic data			1
the @entity2 press release says , " the @entity5 's attempt to collect and map demographic data using race - based criteria for targeting purposes invites unconstitutional racial profiling by law enforcement			1
" an @entity5 spokesman said the bureau is not targeting any particular groups , but that each field office is instructed " to know your domain , that means you understand your entire community			1
" the spokesman said that includes information about what ethnic groups are in a particular area , but it also includes things such as what particular high - tech businesses might reside in a place that could be vulnerable to espionage			0
the @entity5 spokesman said the focus on knowing the domains around each field office is an outgrowth of the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks and the bureau 's focus on improving intelligence gathering , analysis and dissemination			1
the spokesman said this needs to be done in a manner consistent with protecting civil rights and civil liberties			0
the @entity2 is filing @entity61 requests seeking records from 29 states and the @entity0			1
the organization 's press release says the @entity5 's operations guide gives agents authority to gather information and make maps of " so - called ' ethnic - oriented ' businesses , behaviors , lifestyle characteristics and cultural traditions in communities with concentrated ethnic populations			2
" the @entity15 and @entity77 says agents can identify areas with concentrated ethnic populations " if these locations will reasonably aid the analysis of potential threats and vulnerabilities			2
" the guide says intelligence could indicate members of a particular terrorist group are known to reside in communities with a certain ethnic population			0
but the guide also says it 's important to know the location of ethnic groups that might be vulnerable to hate crimes in order for law enforcement to protect such communities			0
fbi director @entity98 spoke about the use of geospatial mapping technology -- combining software and analytical methods with geographic data -- during a november 2008 speech to the @entity105			0
he said the technique is useful in fighting both national security threats and crime			1
" it allows us to combine and visually map crime data from a multitude of agencies -- everything from shootings to sources , and from outstanding warrants to open investigations , " said @entity98			2
" visual mapping shows us our domain			0
it reveals connections among our cases we might not otherwise see			0
and it helps us better manage our resources			0
