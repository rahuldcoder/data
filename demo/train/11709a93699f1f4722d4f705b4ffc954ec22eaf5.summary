they call themselves " the resistance			0
" @entity3 and the @entity4 call them terrorists			0
what 's unclear is who 's calling the shots within the @entity11 militant group @entity10			1
the political and the military arms of the group appear to have contrasting mission statements , and analysts say it 's hard to pin down precisely who has the final word on making decisions and guiding strategy			1
here 's an introduction to @entity10 ' key players : the political wing @entity25 he 's @entity10 ' top political leader and often its public face			1
he 's had the role since 2004 after @entity10 ' then - leader , @entity28 , was killed in an @entity3 airstrike			1
a former teacher , @entity30 operates mostly from @entity32 and is known as @entity10 ' external deal - maker , raising money from supporters in the region			1
" despite his @entity40 - type looks , he 's very much a dangerous man because he aids and abets @entity10 ' very destructive policies and strategy , " said @entity37 of the @entity38			1
while it 's not clear how much control @entity30 has over the military wing of the group , one @entity3 official calls the 58 - year - old " the @entity48 of @entity10			1
" a bizarre assassination plot : in 1997 , @entity30 was the target of a bizarre assassination attempt by the @entity52 , @entity3 's intelligence service			2
@entity52 agents confronted @entity30 in @entity54 and injected or sprayed poison into his ear			0
it might have ended right there			0
but @entity54 's @entity59 , who had a peace treaty with @entity3 , threatened to break off relations unless @entity52 delivered the antidote to the poison			0
then @entity59 , " @entity30 told @entity67 in 2002			0
a $ 70 million budget : in 2012 , @entity30 left his previous base of operations in @entity71 as the country 's civil war deepened			0
that decision is believed to have led to a breakdown in his relationship with @entity78 , @entity10 ' key backer , said @entity79 , head of @entity80 and @entity81 and forecasting at @entity83			1
" the @entity32 , who are backing him now , are not able to provide the military expertise and training on rockets and drones that the military wing needs to fight @entity3 , " he said			1
" these are things that only the @entity78 can provide			2
" but there are other members who still enjoy the support of @entity78			2
and , as @entity30 told @entity67 's @entity96 , @entity10 enjoys the support of expatriate @entity11 , private donors in the @entity80 and @entity100 charities -- enough to bankroll its $ 70 million annual budget			1
" @entity10 -- as a movement of resistance , with a cause , for a people living under occupation -- we seek , not just wait , to get support , financial support , military support , political support from all over the world , from all the states in the world , " he said			1
" everyone giving us support , whether it 's from @entity78 or @entity117 , from anywhere			1
" @entity119 and @entity120 @entity10 formed in 1987 at the start of the first @entity11 intifada , or uprising , as an @entity100 resistance movement against @entity3			2
in 2006 , @entity10 won a majority in @entity11 legislative elections and formed a unity government with its rival @entity128			2
but the coalition collapsed into deadly violence in 2007 , leaving @entity10 in control of @entity132 and the @entity128 - dominated @entity133 in power in the @entity135			1
during @entity10 ' short - lived coalition with @entity128 , @entity119 became prime minister of the @entity133			2
after their 2007 split , he retained the role for @entity10 in @entity132			1
the group 's second political leader is @entity143			1
in @entity78 's good books : @entity119 is a former leader of @entity10 ' student movement			1
he was considered to be a close associate of the group 's founder and spiritual leader , @entity150 , according to the @entity151			1
@entity150 was assassinated by an @entity3 airstrike as he was leaving a @entity154 mosque in 2004			0
" the faction in @entity132 led by @entity119 and @entity143 appears to still be in @entity78 's good books , " said @entity79			1
" it still has good relations with @entity78 , given the increased sophistication of rockets used by @entity10 and @entity160			1
" @entity119 and @entity143 are believed to operate between @entity161 and @entity132			2
but the @entity161 government has made movement between @entity161 and @entity132 a lot harder for @entity10 leaders			1
" the siege has led the @entity132 - based factions to band together , " @entity79 said			2
" they 're more coherent and cohesive			0
" goodwill among the people : part of the pair 's job is to ensure that @entity10 continues to enjoy widespread backing from the general population in @entity132			1
the group does it through its many social welfare programs			0
according to the @entity151 , " ( its ) efforts in this area -- as well as a reputation for honesty , in contrast to the many @entity128 officials accused of corruption -- help to explain its broad popularity			0
" the military wing @entity186 since @entity10 took over @entity132 , the armed wing , @entity187 , has morphed into a military force aimed at protecting the territory			1
its fighters have also continued to periodically fire rockets into @entity3			0
the @entity3 military estimated this month that @entity10 and other militant groups in @entity132 have between them roughly 10,000 rockets of varying ranges			1
the military wing is led by @entity186 , a shadowy , savvy figure who analysts say has survived multiple @entity3 assassination attempts			1
always on the move : the @entity187 ' website says that @entity186 's real name is " @entity204			0
" it says he took the name " @entity186 , " which means " guest , " because under the pursuit of @entity3 security forces , " he kept moving from village to village and from place to place			0
" @entity186 was wounded years ago and is believed to have handed some operational parts of his role to other top @entity10 military leaders like @entity218			1
" over the years , it 's lost a lot of military commanders during assassinations and military conflicts , " said @entity79			2
" it 's proven that it 's robust enough to take this kind of event and keep improving its capability			0
" @entity230 @entity218 's forte is believed to be unconventional attacks on @entity3			0
" it could be these kidnapping or offensive - type operations through attack tunnels underneath the @entity132 border inside @entity3 , " @entity37 said			2
the @entity187 also said it has sent several drones on missions inside @entity3			0
the @entity240 said it shot down a drone off the country 's coast on monday			0
" what we are seeing in this conflict is the military wing asserting itself as the one in control , " said @entity79			1
always a target : and it 's that kind of tactic that may , according to analysts , have made @entity218 one of @entity3 's chief targets in its offensive			0
in 2006 , he survived an @entity3 military assassination attempt			0
this month , his house was targeted in @entity3 airstrikes			0
he 's believed to be in hiding elsewhere			0
@entity260 @entity261 is the head of the @entity187 in the @entity135 , and he is accused of catalyzing this latest conflict			0
@entity3 officials say he 's the person who ordered the abduction of the three @entity3 teens , whose bodies were later found in a field in the @entity135			0
" @entity261 , who used to live in a village north of @entity272 , has urged @entity135 operatives incessantly to set up terror cells and perpetrate kidnappings , " the @entity269 reported last month , quoting an @entity3 security official			0
sitting safe in @entity276 : last month , @entity3 military demolished what is believed to be @entity261 's home in the @entity135			2
but he was n't there			0
his base of operation is @entity276 , where he 's safe from the reaches of the @entity3 forces			0
@entity276 cut all diplomatic relations with @entity3 after commandos boarded a boat carrying supplies to @entity132 and killed nine people in 2010			2
act of desperation : so , who exactly is in charge ? " none of these movements are monoliths , " said @entity79			2
still , he said , " what we are seeing in this conflict is the military wing asserting itself as the one in control			1
" @entity301 , who was a former adviser to the @entity133 , said @entity10 is in one of the weakest positions it 's been in in several years			2
" the changes that have happened in the region and especially in @entity161 ; their closure of the tunnels and its access to finances and weapons have been severely diminished over the last year in particular			0
so they 're in a much weaker position , " he said			0
and that weakened position , he says , is fueling the military wing 's belligerence			1
" i think part of the motivation for sort of , you know , taking the @entity3 bait , if you will , in this latest round of violence has been , i think , the fact that they 're in a state of disarray and , you know , in a way i think it 's an act of desperation by a very weak @entity10			2

amid the @entity132 conflict , experts try to figure out who 's in charge
movements like @entity10 are n't " monoliths , " one analyst says
the military wing in @entity132 appears to be asserting its control
the group 's political leader in @entity32 may have lost favor with @entity78
