-- some quick thoughts from @entity2 just before the @entity3 raise the curtain on their second night : did @entity5 move the needle ? while some offer dissent , there is general agreement across the political spectrum that @entity12 stole the show on opening night			1
@entity14 at @entity15 said she gave the most effective speech he had ever heard from a political wife -- and remembering star turns from @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 and @entity23 , that is saying a lot			0
@entity26 of the @entity27 wrote , " the night belonged to @entity12 , and she aced it			1
" from the @entity0 skybox , i tweeted , " in 2004 , @entity31 was born as a national star at the @entity34 convention			0
tonight it was @entity12 's turn			1
" the question now becomes : did she move the needle for her husband ? a few have speculated that she could have lifted his numbers by 4 percentage points			0
the truth is that we wo n't know until the numbers come in , but my hunch is , there wo n't be an obvious bounce			0
rather , what she did is to prompt a whole lot of wavering voters to take a second look at her husband thursday night			1
that is a huge contribution in a race this tight ... but it is still up to him to close the sale			0
opinion : @entity12 did great , but wo n't move needle what must @entity66 deliver ? the pressure is on @entity66 on wednesday night to do even more than @entity12			1
from a @entity3 perspective , he is the one who has to keep the base fired up with hard - edged conservatism even as he persuades independents and disillusioned @entity34 that they can be comfortable with him as the ideological leader of a @entity75 presidency			1
that wo n't be an easy rope to tread , but @entity66 has managed it well			2
the @entity75 campaign was drifting badly when @entity66 came aboard and has since righted itself			1
it is true , as analysts like @entity81 have written , that @entity66 has n't provided a big lift in national polls , but he has brought a new vitality -- not only to the party ( just wait for the hall to erupt wednesday night when he is introduced ) but to @entity75 himself			1
and he has put not only @entity87 in play but possibly more of the upper @entity89			0
meanwhile , the downsides that @entity3 strategists worried so much about when he was named have n't materialized			0
@entity34 attacks on his @entity96 ideas , for example , do n't seem to be cutting much ( perhaps the @entity34 convention will change that ? )			0
and for some , @entity66 's youthful good looks add a little sex appeal			1
but on wednesday , he will be on the biggest stage in his life			0
those in the hall will want red meat , far more than they got from @entity107 on tuesday night , but many in his television audience will be deciding whether they want him at the center of national power -- and only a heartbeat from the presidency			2
this will be the second most important speech of the convention			0
an election between two transitional candidates ? there has been an unmistakable air in @entity2 that even as they work for victory , leading @entity3 are looking over @entity75 's shoulder , asking who will be out front if he loses			1
@entity107 's much - anticipated speech tuesday night has drawn scorn because he seemed to be auditioning for himself for 2016			1
he was n't giving a keynote , the joke goes , but an acceptance			0
@entity134 's speech , while better , was also less about @entity75 than his own views			1
and of course , tensions are running high between @entity138 and his followers vs. the @entity75 team			2
all of this is now coalescing into a narrative on full display in an insightful piece by @entity145 in @entity146			0
@entity145 writes that supporters of up - and - coming 40 - somethings -- from @entity66 to @entity148 to @entity149 -- increasingly see themselves as the true heirs of an upbeat , @entity153 - style conservatism and that @entity75 , at 65 , is a more of a placeholder , win or lose			1
that mood could change over the next two days -- @entity75 has a self - interest in changing it -- but if it holds , it will add a new dimension to the 2012 election			2
as he bids for a second term , @entity31 faces the prospect that if even if he wins , as a lame duck president , power will begin to seep away a couple of years from now			0
that goes with the territory			0
so , in a fundamental way , history may one day record that an @entity20 - @entity75 race was actually a contest between two transitional figures			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

@entity173 : @entity12 got the best *reviews* on the first night of the @entity176
he says she wowed the crowd , but will her speech gain new voters for @entity75 ?
@entity173 : @entity66 faces task of *pleasing* the party 's base and appealing to a wider audience
he says younger leaders are looking beyond @entity75 for future top candidates
