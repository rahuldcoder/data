-- the intense situation in @entity2 , @entity3 , is disturbingly familiar to us			1
in november , it will be eight years since we suffered the same tragedy as @entity8 's parents			1
our unarmed son , @entity9 , was killed in a barrage of 50 shots fired by @entity13 plainclothes police officers on his wedding day , november 25 , 2006			1
our prayers go out to the @entity8 family , and we offer @entity8 's parents , @entity18 and @entity8 , our hearts and support			1
we know how it feels to have your child snatched away , slain by the police			0
i remember the gut - wrenching moment we learned the details of our son 's brutal final moments			2
as if that was n't enough , we also had to deal with the public defamation of our son 's character , which seemed to be saying : " he was an animal , he deserved to die			2
" the killing of unarmed black men has become a staggering pattern across the @entity40 , and for the city of @entity2 , the outrage has reached its boiling point			1
but we are concerned about the effects the citizens ' outrage and their retributive actions might have on the grieving family			0
my wife , @entity49 , believes the racial situation in @entity2 has forced its citizens to aggressively rebel against the infringement of their civil rights			2
it 's true , protesters initially responded to the killing with violence and looting -- which , if continued at that level , would have ultimately destroyed their community and produced the opposite of what they were fighting for in their search for justice			1
the @entity8 family called for peace in the midst of looting and violent protesting			1
although the looting has stopped , clashes between protesters and police stayed heightened this week , with the @entity73 , troopers and police in riot gear confronting angry demonstrators			0
the chaos is reminiscent of the @entity79			0
i was born and raised in @entity80 and clearly recall the protesters armed with passion for change , protest signs , and their voice of power confronting police armed with batons , water hoses , shotguns and police dogs			0
in this new day , things are different			0
various reports , often contested , say police and protesters were in full battle , with armed police using armored vehicles , tear gas and rubber bullets as shotguns rang out and some protesters threw @entity104 cocktails			0
the tactics have changed in the new generation 's battle , but the causes remain the same : justice and equality			2
my wife and i stand in solidarity with @entity2 's call for justice in the killing of the unarmed teenager @entity8			1
but we also stand with the @entity8 family 's call for peaceful protesting			1
it seems protests are calming down , which is very good news			0
during this dynamic climate of change in @entity2 , it is imperative not to lose sight of what is in the best interest of the family			1
@entity2 seems to be in a civil war as @entity8 's family struggles with the legal complexity of this fight			1
they are at the core of it all			0
many miles must be traveled in their journey for justice			0
my wife and i know well the transitional process the @entity8 family must endure			1
finding a balance between fighting for justice and mourning the loss of your child can become overwhelmingly challenging			0
when their time comes to lay their son to rest , it should be a time of peace , giving the family space for grieving and moving forward			2
many emotions are running high in @entity2			2
however , not one of those emotions can compare with the anguish the family is experiencing ; and that should be considered throughout this journey for justice .			0

@entity162 and @entity164 's son was unarmed when police killed him on his wedding day
bells : police too often kill unarmed black men ; @entity8 's death has roiled @entity2
the bells stand in solidarity with @entity2 's call for justice in the killing of the unarmed teen
bells : but protests must be *nonviolent* for the sake of the @entity8 family , who need peace
