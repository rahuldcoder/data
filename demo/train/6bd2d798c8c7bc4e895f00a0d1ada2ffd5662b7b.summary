-- newly released 3 - d images of two mummified baby mammoths provide a window into the lives and deaths of creatures that roamed @entity7 over 40,000 years ago			1
details in the x-ray scans have let researchers look at things like the specimens ' bone structures , causes of death , and even how healthy they were before they died			1
by comparing the specimens to each other , to other mammoths , and to their only living cousinsâ € ” elephantsâ € ” researchers have added a lot to what we know about mammoths			2
computed tomography ( @entity26 ) scanning uses millions of ultra-thin x-ray slices to build @entity30 models of solid objects			0
the scans tell scientists how solid objects are put together without having to take them apart			1
the donut - shaped machines are relatively common in hospitals , and there are some veterinary machines that can do full - body scans of dolphins and small whales			1
but the size and shape of a mammoth with its limbs frozen in place , even a baby one , means it ca n't be safely fit into machines designed for long , thin , living things			2
but scientists are n't the only ones interested in scanning the insides of large objects			2
outside of @entity55 , the @entity54 has a large , industrial ct scanner they use to look inside big , awkward objects like car transmissions and engine blocks			0
and when one of the mammoths was being transported in a @entity65 truck from @entity67 's @entity66 to the @entity68 in @entity69 in 2010 , scientists at the @entity61 saw an opportunity			1
" we knew the drivers had to sleep at some point in the route , " said mammoth expert @entity71			0
so he and his colleagues convinced @entity78 's @entity77 handlers to make an overnight detour to @entity55			1
read more : get ready to learn a @entity80 about @entity81 the things @entity71 and his colleagues learned from the resulting 3 - d images made big news			1
@entity78 was only a month old when she died , and is one of the most well - preserved mammoths ever found			1
the new research published today in the @entity90 compares @entity78 's scans to those of another relatively well - preserved baby mammoth , @entity94 , who died several thousand years before , and several thousand miles away			1
@entity71 's team was able to recreate , with reasonable certainty , how the two mammoths died			1
combined with other research , they also used these scans to get a broader picture of how young mammoths lived			1
@entity78 's trunk , trachea , and lungs were filled with sediment			1
@entity71 thinks this happened when she inhaled mud and choked to death after she fell into cold water			2
the scans also revealed traces on her face and in her lungs of an iron - rich mineral that usually occurs in oxygen - poor places like lake beds			2
@entity71 thinks this means she fell and settled at the bottom of a @entity125 lake , which has since dried up			0
besides an oddly - compressed left ribcage , @entity78 's largely intact body suggests she spent most of the next 40,000 years in the tundra tucked peacefully away			1
her postmortem existence became more turbulent after she was discovered by reindeer hunters in 2007			0
according to @entity71 , their leader recognized @entity78 's importance and trekked many miles in the snow to alert the authorities			2
in the meantime , a less - civic - minded relative sold @entity78 to a local shop that put her on display for tourists			1
the @entity77 authorities found her , but not before dogs had chewed off her ear and tail			0
science has treated her more respectfully , but she 's still been thawed , refrozen , chemically preserved , sawed into , prodded , poked , shipped , and scanned since she was rescued			0
@entity147 fared a little worse than @entity78			2
not only did she have a broken back , her body had been picked at by ravens and arctic foxes			0
but after surviving thousands of @entity7 winters , it was the @entity77 bureaucracy that almost did her in			0
soon after they found @entity94 , @entity77 scientists sent samples of her tissue to a microbiology lab. " there was somebody at this lab who claimed they found @entity162 on this baby mammoth , " he said			1
the @entity77 decided the carcass should be incinerated immediately			0
read more : 30 years after @entity166 , gripping photos expose the @entity167 @entity71 and other mammoth experts delayed the destruction by calling for an investigation			2
that summer at an annual conference on mammoths , the scientists tried to come up with a strategy to save @entity147			2
finally , they convinced the @entity77 to let them destroy the bacteria by putting the mammoth inside a nuclear reactor			0
still frozen ( @entity78 was chemically desiccated in a manner similar to @entity179 ) , @entity71 says @entity94 spent five days at a @entity181 power plant and then went to a @entity181 hospital for partial - body scanning			1
@entity147 never made it to a full - body ct machine , but her scans were still informative			2
like @entity78 , her trunk , mouth and throat were filled with sediment , suggesting she also choked to death			1
from tusk samples , @entity71 determined that @entity147 was about two months old when she died			0
she had a wider head and jawbone than @entity78 , and more well - developed feet and shoulders than the younger mammoth			1
the researchers are unsure if @entity147 actually grew that much in just a month , or if her bigger bones indicate she 's from an undescribed sub-species			0
the two mummies set a baseline for comparing other young mammoth remains and will help researchers build a fuller picture of how they grew and were cared for , @entity71 says			0
they can also reveal how similar mammoths were to elephants , their only living relative			0
for example , @entity147 's skull is slightly smaller than an elephant 's of the same age , which suggests mammoths developed more slowly			0
mammoths also had smaller ears , fatty humps , and coats of long hair , but @entity71 says they 're more alike than different to their modern cousins			0
" we 've learned with direct , physical evidence how similar they are : how similar in family structure , life history , and very similar bodies			0

@entity61 scientists compare 3 - d scans of two mummified baby mammoths
the resulting images of the scan suggest they both choked to death
@entity78 , the younger of the two , died when she was one month old , 40,000 years ago
@entity94 died several thousand years earlier
