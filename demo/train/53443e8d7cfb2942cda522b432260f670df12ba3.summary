-- what is seen by some as the holy four - day weekend for geek culture at @entity5 has gone mainstream in a big way for the past few years			1
are you a @entity5 beginner ? get the rules right ! starting today , there will be panels called " i ca n't write , i ca n't draw , but i love comics ! " and " @entity15 " taking place alongside " @entity18 's ' psych ' " and " @entity19 , @entity20 ! " a panel about @entity23 ' upcoming remake of " @entity24			1
" but this recent spate of panels about movie and tv properties with no sci - fi or comic book elements has some fans fuming			1
" the mainstream tv and film representation at @entity5 has outstripped the original essence of the convention , " said @entity32 who attended @entity5 the past two years , mainly for the panels on " lost			1
" he believed that this " mainstreaming " of the convention has played a hand in it being filled to capacity			2
going to @entity5 ? for one panel , @entity32 said he arrived a full 45 minutes before it was set to begin			1
" thirty minutes passed and i thought for sure i was getting closer to the front door			0
finally , 10 minutes after the start , some nice @entity5 attendee started walking back through the line to let everyone know that they were full up and no one else would be getting in			1
" @entity32 is not attending the convention this year since " lost " has ended			2
one @entity55 , @entity56 , has not attended in years			0
" i do n't even try anymore , " she said			2
" " they should have a @entity58 and bring back @entity5 the way it used to be			1
" " it 's too crowded , too commercial , and , oh yea , it sells out before you even know who 's gon na be there , " she said			0
" i 'd be really disappointed spending my money and seeing that i was gon na go to a panel discussion about [ the @entity69 series ] ' glee			0
' " the fact that " @entity70 " attended last year ( and is returning this year ) certainly seemed to fuel anger among some @entity5 devotees			1
" it used to be the coolest thing in the world and now it 's just a reason not to drive downtown for a few days			0
" @entity80 , a hardcore fan of " @entity81 , " is one of those who disagrees			0
" i am not one of those who believe it should remain solely in the realm of comics and their related forms of media , " she said			0
" i personally really enjoy the fact that @entity5 has become a celebration of popular culture and every entertainment medium			1
" even those who have covered the convention have differing opinions about it			0
@entity98 of @entity99 does n't think that non-genre panels are a very good idea			1
" i guess the studios figure , well , as long as we 're here we might as well throw this movie out there			0
... maybe we give this a little boost , " he said			0
" last year , at one of the studio panels , they had the @entity112 film , ' extract , ' and people saw the footage			2
then the movie completely tanked			0
" @entity118 's @entity117 , on the other hand , sees a place for these kinds of panels at @entity5			1
" i think that what it 's really about is anything that has a strong fan base			0
it also brings in other people to the convention that otherwise would n't be interested , " she said			2
quite a few people she has talked to , however , disagree with her			0
she even recalls a quite vocal reaction last year to a movie that , on the surface , would seem like a good fit			2
" con - goers were protesting at the @entity139 booth saying ... with signs , ' @entity136 , ' because fans could n't get into see panels earlier in the day because of the thousands of ' @entity136 ' fans that descended on @entity144 " this year , those fans can breathe a sigh of relief , since the cast of " @entity149 " wo n't be there -- this year			1
but there are plenty of other panels , such as one for @entity156 's cop comedy " @entity158 , " which will ensure the debate continues .			2

*longtime* fans of @entity5 are n't *impressed* by non-genre panels
some think the pop culture *expansion* of @entity5 *caters* is counter to original purpose
many comic - con *visitors* were upset that " @entity136 " fans created *traffic* jams last year
