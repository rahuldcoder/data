@entity0 -- the pocketbook of a @entity6 woman whose disappearance in 2010 led authorities to the discovery of 10 sets of human remains across two @entity11 , @entity0 , counties has been found , police said wednesday			1
a cell phone that authorities believe may also belong to @entity16 -- whose disappearance triggered a search that has become a hunt for a possible serial killer -- was also found on @entity11 's @entity21 , alongside a pair of jeans and shoes , according to @entity26 police commissioner @entity25			1
" we 're going to do everything we can to find her , " he told reporters			0
" it is our belief her body or parts of her remains are in ( an area of @entity21 ) , and we will continue ( to ) search tonight and into tomorrow			1
" after @entity41 vanished in may 2010 , the search for her led police seven months later to four bodies found along a quarter - mile stretch of @entity21			1
additional remains were uncovered in subsequent months in neighboring @entity46 and along beachfront property in @entity48 , about 40 miles east of @entity0			2
like the four victims found last december , @entity41 had advertised prostitution services on websites such as @entity52			2
@entity41 's sisters have said the missing woman was an escort who was visiting a client			0
they said she ran from the man 's house and called 911 , saying someone was trying to hurt her			0
a man who lives a few miles from where the first set of remains were found last december told @entity1 that a young woman who " looked like she was partying all night " came to his door at about 5 a.m. on may 1 , 2010			1
" she was screaming ' help me , help me ! ' and said somebody was chasing her , " said resident @entity70			0
wednesday 's find comes after renewed search efforts by federal and state authorities in @entity21 -- the area where @entity41 was last believed to be , at a so - called private party			1
" this may be just a young lady ( who ) ran into the brush in hysterical state , fell down and expired for some reason , " added @entity25			0
the police commissioner announced earlier this week that the investigation likely revolves around a possible serial killer -- a departure from his prior statements , in which @entity25 said the bodies could be the work of multiple killers			1
it is not clear what prompted the change in focus toward one killer			0
" what 's common here is the dumping ground , " he said			0
authorities have sifted through more than 1,000 tips related to the case , with police upping the ante in their search for a culprit			2
the reward for information leading to an arrest -- once topping out at $ 5,000 -- was raised five-fold , making it the largest offered in @entity26 history .			0

search for @entity16 in 2010 led to discovery of 10 bodies on @entity11
a cell phone was also found alongside a pair of jeans and shoes , police added
