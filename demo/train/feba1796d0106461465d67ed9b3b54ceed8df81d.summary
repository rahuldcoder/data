-- people sometimes have difficulty understanding why the families of those who die in disasters are so invested in the recovery of their loved ones ' bodies			1
this painful process has been once again brought into sharp relief by the difficulty of retrieving the bodies of those lost in the downing of @entity15 17 from @entity17 rebels who control the crash site			0
the @entity19 notes that international humanitarian law requires combatants to respect the bodies of those who die in conflict , reflecting the importance people attach to the bodies of their loved ones			0
throughout history , most cultures have emphasized the management of the bodies of the deceased			0
indeed , cultures around the world ( and religions are a part of one 's culture ) still observe different , important , traditions for what happens with human remains , most commonly ranging from burial to various forms of cremation			1
grieving families often are eager to perform their traditional rituals for the remains of their loved ones , a process that can bring some level of comfort			1
but in the early stages of mass casualty disasters , families often share the experience of grief with other families whose loved ones have died , sometimes joining together in a family assistance center to await news of their loved ones and the identification of the remains			1
after day of tributes , more remains of victims to arrive in @entity62 it is when the remains of their loved ones are returned to the family that the more personal experience of the death tends to begin			1
families will generally leave the family assistance center and return to their homes to grieve with their extended families and friends			2
while many funerary rituals can be performed without a body , knowing the exact disposition of the loved ones ' remains is often a crucial comfort to the family			1
the death of a loved one can of course be devastating , even if that person is the only one to die in an incident			2
but disaster mental health professionals know that mass casualty disasters are much more difficult for families than disasters in which only a few people die			2
it is n't clear why , but the old adage that misery loves company does not seem to apply to mass casualty disasters			0
as stressful as mass casualty incidents are , however , responders generally know to expect an even more stressful disaster if it is an incident in which body recovery is likely to be very difficult or even impossible			2
the recent disappearance of @entity100 is a classic example			0
without knowing even the location of the downed aircraft , the recovery of the remains of the passengers and crew becomes more unlikely with each passing day			0
this is likely to complicate the grieving process for the survivors			1
traditional cultural rituals for the dead help us to process grief in a meaningful way			1
grief is n't magically resolved through these rituals , but it is one step in the process of building a new life without the presence of the loved one			1
what happens to the victims ' bodies next ? the emphasis on the return of the bodies of loved ones to their families is also reflected in the efforts of government officials			2
many times rescue and recovery personnel place their own lives at risk as they try to return bodies			0
underwater recoveries such as the crash of flight 800 in 1996 , for example , present extreme challenges to the recovery teams			0
similarly , in the aftermath of the attacks of september 11 , thousands of personnel worked in difficult and dangerous efforts to recover the remains of those who died			0
some who worked in these recovery efforts have told me that the work was extremely dangerous , but that it was worth it to help the families as they grieved			2
similarly , personnel working in mass casualty morgues have often asked me to tell the families of the deceased how respectfully the remains of their loved ones were treated			0
within mainstream @entity167 culture , people often seem uncomfortable with the grieving process			1
individuals coping with the death of a loved one are often told to " get over it " or " move on			0
" but even in ideal situations , the grieving process may continue for a year or more in healthy individuals , and periods of grief may continue to occur for years			1
some moment may trigger a memory of the loved one who died and lead to a reawakening of the grief			0
this is not a sign of psychopathology , but of being human			0
the most helpful process in dealing with grief seems to be talking with family , friends and spiritual leaders			1
it is also useful to understand that you do n't have to be mentally ill to seek support from a mental health professional			0
this may be particularly useful if family and friends do n't seem to understand or appreciate the grief one is experiencing .			1

@entity199 : some do n't get why recovery of loved one 's body so important to families
he says cultures and family units have long needed rituals to process a death , give comfort
he says not recovering body complicates grieving process . @entity216 deaths make it worse
@entity199 : grief makes @entity167 uncomfortable but grieving not mental illness , it 's human
