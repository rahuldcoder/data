-- @entity3 police wednesday arrested 12 people in a counterterrorism operation , and locations were being searched , authorities said			1
a @entity9 official 's papers show details of the raid , which have been obscured in this photo			2
arrests were carried out in a series of raids in northwest @entity17 , police said			2
participating agencies included @entity19 , @entity20 and the @entity21 , according to a statement from @entity20			1
the men arrested were involved in a " very serious " plot closely associated with @entity25 and escaped @entity25 operative @entity26 , whom @entity3 intelligence have linked to the 2006 plot to blow up trans - @entity30 airliners , according to a security source with knowledge of the investigation			1
the new plot was not believed to be targeting national infrastructure , such as rail lines , airports or utilities , nor was it clear if the plot was to involved bombs or an assault involving gunmen , the source said			1
details , the source said , were speculative at this point in the investigation			2
the source also said authorities do n't believe the targets would have been in the north of @entity17 , where the arrests took place , and that at least some of those arrested were @entity57 in the @entity3 on student visas			1
several hundred officers were involved in the raids , according to a later @entity20 statement			2
the men arrested range in age from a youth in his mid- to late teens to a 41 - year - old , the statement said			1
no further information was available , police said			0
" today 's action is part of an ongoing investigation and we have acted on intelligence received , " said @entity72 , chief superintendent of @entity74 police			1
" we understand that this kind of police activity can cause concerns to people living in nearby communities			0
the extra patrols , cordons and measures we have in place have been implemented to make sure we are doing everything we can to reassure the public and maintain public safety			0
" home secretary @entity93 , in a written statement , congratulated police for the " successful anti-terrorism operation which has resulted in 12 arrests at a number of locations			0
" she said the actions were an operational decision by police and @entity102 , but she and @entity3 prime minister @entity103 were kept apprised			1
police rushed to make the arrests after press photographers on tuesday snapped images of the @entity3 's chief terrorism officer as he got out of a car at the prime minister 's residence , according to the security source			1
@entity104 assistant commissioner @entity113 was carrying a document containing the names of those to be arrested , the source said , and the photographers were able to easily read the names when they enlarged the photographs			1
but , the source said , the arrests would probably have taken place thursday , and preparations for the arrests were the reason for @entity113 's visit to see @entity103			2
" tonight , the focus is the ongoing operation			0
that 's my priority , " @entity93 said			0
@entity9 issued a statement regarding the incident			0
" @entity113 accepts he made a mistake on leaving a sensitive document on open view and deeply regrets it			0
he has apologized to the commissioner and the colleagues			0
" @entity0 's @entity137 and @entity138 contributed to this report .			0
