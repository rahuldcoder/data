-- the @entity1 warned consumers on thursday that popular pain reliever acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions in some people			1
the @entity1 will now require a warning about the skin conditions to be added to the labels of prescription drug containing acetaminophen and will ask manufacturers of acetaminophen products to add warnings to their over-the - counter medications			1
acetaminophen is found in numerous prescription and over-the - counter products designed to treat pain and reduce fever			0
according to the @entity1 , the skin reactions , known as @entity21 , toxic epidermal necroylis and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis are rare but can be deadly			1
these conditions can cause blisters , serious rashes , reddening of the skin and the detachment of the upper surface of the skin known as the epidermis			1
the reactions can appear at any time people take the product , even if they only take it once			0
other drugs designed to treat fever and pain , such as ibuprofen and naproxen , also carry the risk of these skin reactions , but they already carry a warning on their labels			2
the @entity1 stresses that anyone who develops these types of conditions after using acetaminophen should stop taking the product immediately and visit a doctor or emergency room			0
if people have already experienced these skin problems while occasionally taking acetaminophen , they should not take the drug again and should inform their doctor about the reaction , the @entity1 said			0
the @entity1 decided to announce the warning after evaluating serious skin reactions associated with acetaminophen			1
from 1969 to 2012 , it identified 91 cases of @entity21 / ten and 16 cases of @entity65 , which resulted in 67 hospitalizations and 12 deaths			0
the agency said it is difficult to determine how frequently serious skin reactions occur with the ingredient because the drug has been used by so many people for such a long time and at different doses			2
however , it estimates that these skin outbreaks are rare .			0
