-- growing up in rural @entity1 , about 13 miles from the @entity3 border and a 90 - minute drive from the nearest @entity5 , @entity6 relied on magazines for her pop culture fix			2
the young @entity9 never saw anyone in the pages of @entity12 who looked like her			0
but as an adult , she 's working to change that , promoting the work of @entity18 fashion designers and artists			1
she began with the 2009 launch of @entity21 , a blog that highlights native designers and discusses their place in media and pop culture			1
even @entity6 was surprised by its initial success -- by the size of its audience , the positive feedback , the readers asking , " where can i buy that ? " the blog expanded to include an online boutique last year , placing @entity6 at the center of a growing movement to reclaim what fashion labels " @entity18			1
" she 's surrounded by a group of passionate native designers , artists , stylists , photographers and bloggers who have already proven that by raising their voices they can hold companies accountable			1
instead of just reacting to controversies , @entity6 and her cohorts want to promote authentic examples of modern @entity52 fashion			1
their work reflects the diversity of @entity57 's indigenous communities , from the southeastern @entity58 to @entity3 's @entity59 , but their message is clear : true @entity52 fashion is more than what 's for sale at @entity65 or @entity66			1
related : native americans fight cultural caricatures when blogger @entity70 of @entity71 outed @entity72 last year for holding a powwow - themed party , the company not only apologized but invited @entity70 and @entity6 to speak at an upcoming industry panel on cultural appropriation			2
the company is also working with @entity6 to develop collections featuring four native designers			2
whenever a celebrity dons a feather and long braids for a photo shoot , or a fashion brand releases a gaudy collection of " totem pole print " tracksuits , bloggers like @entity6 and @entity70 are slammed with questions about why they 're offensive			2
@entity6 says they should be showing better examples -- tasteful , appropriate use of @entity52 iconography , and talented native designers			1
it 's the work of @entity95 designer @entity94 , the first @entity18 to appear on " @entity96 ; " the art of @entity97 , a @entity98 artist and designer who collaborated with @entity100 ; the sexy couture gowns of @entity102 and other designers who appeared in the first @entity104 launched earlier this month to spotlight @entity52 - made fashion from couture to street wear			1
" creativity is our tradition and there 's a lot of talent in @entity114 waiting to be exposed , " @entity6 said			1
part of the work is advancing mainstream @entity57 's perception of @entity52 fashion , going beyond headdresses , fringed jackets and , yes , buckskin			1
on a practical level , it 's about finding places to market and sell native - made goods , @entity6 said			2
the clothing and jewelry is n't only intended for natives			0
it 's meant to appeal to wide audiences , even if people do n't know the significance of a pattern or design			0
" these are not your stereotypical @entity18 designs			0
they 're very contemporary , which is the point : to present new visions of what @entity18 fashion means , " said @entity138 , the vice president of curatorial and exhibitions at @entity141 ' @entity140 , a @entity142			2
" they incorporate designs that have a lot of meaning to them , but to the average viewer they might just look like a dragonfly or zigzag lines , and that 's ok			0
" @entity6 was a guest curator for a show about @entity52 couture at the @entity159 in @entity160 , @entity161 , while @entity138 was the museum 's director			1
@entity6 was completing her dissertation about modern @entity18 fashion			1
" she 's done a fabulous job of researching @entity52 fashion 's roots , but now she 's taking it into the 21st century , " @entity138 said			1
" she 's moved it into the digital age , which not might seem like a big deal , but it 's new and forward thinking for @entity114			1
" the work occurs beyond @entity6 's website			0
they 're using fashion shows , pop - up boutiques and speaking engagements to spread their message			2
in march , @entity6 was in @entity179 , @entity160 and @entity180 for events promoting @entity52 fashion			1
@entity70 joined her for a talk this week , aptly named " @entity184 , " at @entity185 -- one of many stops they make on college campuses			0
related : @entity189 reject " screaming @entity114 " logo earlier this year , @entity6 staged a three - day photo shoot of the latest looks in @entity52 fashion , from couture to street wear , with fashion photographer @entity195 and @entity141 - based designer @entity102			1
the result was the @entity104 , which @entity6 says is the first compilation of modern @entity52 fashion produced exclusively by natives			1
they launched the book in march at the @entity203 in @entity179 , an annual gathering of tribal leaders , state and local elected officials and top ceos from @entity114			1
" the lookbook is a brilliant indigenous response to the rip - offs being marketed in mainstream media , " said @entity209 , a citizen of the @entity210 and @entity212 editor of @entity213 , the largest native - operated media organization in the country			1
" here , you have a collection of 17 native artists with all native models , photographers , graphics artists and business management -- the whole package on their intellectual and cultural terms			2
" so , instead of jewelry that 's all turquoise and silver , metalsmith @entity228 creates pieces she says honors the aesthetic traditions of the @entity236 people			0
she works with copper , using the same relief sculpture techniques as her ancestors			0
her signature " serpent cuffs " resemble reptile scales , referring to a deity from southeastern @entity18 spirituality			0
the cuffs are adorned with black freshwater pearls harvested from the @entity248 watershed , a nod to where her tribe lived before the @entity252			0
each cuff starts at $ 700			0
" if you have a family or tribal connection it becomes very personal , " @entity254 said			0
" it 's more than making jewelry ; it becomes working for a culture that you want to pass on to future generations			0
" then there 's @entity266 , who contributed two skirts and a jacket to the lookbook			0
she began working with beads and sewing as a child on the @entity273 in @entity274 , and at 22 , became the youngest artist to earn best in show at @entity161 's @entity277 , the largest crafts fair in @entity114			2
she makes elaborately beaded high heels , colorful jackets and dresses that evoke the patterns of the @entity283 and @entity284			0
" clothing is wearable art and i want to use my skills to create something beautiful that reflects the cultural heritage of my tribe , " @entity266 said			2
@entity266 said anyone who wants to interpret native patterns and motifs should be allowed to do so , but they should do it in a respectful way			0
" as long as they understand the importance of the symbols or patterns being utilized and they do so in a tasteful way , why not ? " @entity266 said			0
still , on major store shelves , @entity52 fashion is still most likely to be " @entity210 - inspired " prints , feathered headdresses or fake turquoise jewelry			1
the lookbook represents authentic , modern @entity52 imagery , designer and co-creator @entity308 said			1
" it 's disheartening to see @entity18 fashion as cheap knockoffs , " @entity308 said			0
" to change that , we have to be the voice for what @entity18 fashion is , instead of just complaining about it			0
" growing up on the @entity324 , @entity102 's aunties taught her how to bead and make shawls in the tradition of her people , the @entity320 and @entity321 who share the vast tribal territory			0
thanks to a high school teacher who encouraged @entity102 and helped her find a design school , she moved to @entity274 , where she broke into a career as a pattern maker			0
five years after arriving in @entity141 , she now divides her creative efforts between a full - time job designing for mass market retail brands and her own line , which is inspired by her love for @entity52 culture and high - end couture , she said			1
@entity102 wants to inspire other natives to follow their passion and show the rest of the world that @entity346 are a thriving , modern people that have plenty to contribute , especially in the fashion world			2
" when i was in high school i never imagined that i could be a mover and shaker in the fashion industry as a @entity52 woman , " she said			1
" but now that i 'm a part of the industry , there 's this window of opportunity for me to be a voice for our communities			0
