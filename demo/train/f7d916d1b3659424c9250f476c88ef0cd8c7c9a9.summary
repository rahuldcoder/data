-- the @entity3 and @entity4 allies ' campaign of airstrikes against @entity6 and the @entity7 and @entity8 is a necessary step , but airpower on its own wo n't be enough to ensure a military victory			1
to beat @entity12 and extremist affiliates , the @entity3 and its allies must work more closely with the groups that these terrorists most fear : the @entity18 and @entity21 @entity20 tribes			1
the effectiveness of the air campaign will hinge on how well the @entity3 can exploit the local vulnerabilities of the asymmetric threat it faces in @entity12			1
with this in mind , it makes sense to coordinate with @entity18 commanders , who have on - the - ground experience identifying @entity12 ' weak points and can ensure that airstrikes hit the right targets			0
indeed , unless the @entity3 - led coalition moves fast to better integrate the @entity18 into military operations , it will simply be hacking at @entity12 ' branches rather than getting down to its roots			1
@entity12 ' concern was evident in a sleek , hourlong documentary the group produced , called " @entity44			0
" after touting a series of victories in @entity8 and @entity47 , @entity12 lamented its " temporary withdrawal " from large swaths of northern @entity8 , which was forced by the @entity18 ( which @entity12 derisively describes as the " awakening forces " )			1
the setback referred to was the surprise counterattack launched by the @entity18 in january against @entity12 positions in three provinces in northern and eastern @entity8			0
at the height of the fighting , @entity12 was forced to defend its headquarters in heavy street fighting in the eastern city of @entity60			0
the extremists were taken by surprise , and the @entity18 and tribal backers ' assault offers a useful primer on how to beat @entity6 and its offspring			0
for a start , a joint operations center should be established to serve as a clearinghouse for targeting data and intelligence sharing with @entity8 opposition and tribal forces fighting @entity12			1
@entity75 and @entity76 special forces , both of whom have worked with @entity3 special forces in other theaters of war , could be deployed in very limited numbers to provide forward air support to guide pinpoint airstrikes			1
meanwhile , @entity84 , who have played a key role in supporting @entity88 security forces in @entity47 against @entity12 , should be deployed to the border regions so that they can support @entity18 ground operations			2
in addition , the @entity3 should deploy a special operations team in neighboring @entity47 focused on developing a relationship with @entity95 guerrilla forces and tribal leaders that continue to resist @entity12 along the @entity8 - @entity47 border			1
this team could be empowered to establish a special fund ( of which @entity101 allies can serve as the main contributors ) for recruiting and empowering tribal elements in eastern @entity8 like the @entity105 confederation that have already begun to rise up against @entity12			0
@entity3 investment on this front would enable airstrikes to truly tip the balance of the conflict			0
finally , the transfer of excess @entity3 military equipment to @entity114 forces in the field should be accelerated to ensure that the @entity18 and the tribes not only have enough ammunition to sustain a defensive posture against @entity12 , but also enough for a multipronged assault into @entity12 ' core territory			1
if airstrikes are to have a lasting impact , they must cut off @entity12 ' land bridge between @entity8 and @entity47 and ultimately decapitate its command structure			0
doing so will mean the @entity3 will have to work with , and through , a fast moving and relatively lightly armed counterforce , the groundwork for which may already have been laid with the announcement of @entity3 plans to train an initial force of 5,000 @entity8 fighters			2
@entity12 appears to be gambling that by concentrating its forces in the relatively exposed terrain of the northern @entity133 that it can overrun positions in the city of @entity4 and in the northern @entity137 countryside before the airstrikes can have a real impact			2
but it can also be expected to prioritize the targeting of capable @entity21 @entity4 commanders and tribal leaders who it views as its principal threat , particularly because of their experience engaging @entity12 on the ground			0
the fact is that @entity12 has made it abundantly obvious that it sees its @entity147 in both @entity47 and @entity8 as the local populace			2
as airstrikes intensify , @entity3 and regional military planners should take note .			0

@entity153 and @entity154 : to beat @entity12 , @entity3 must work with groups it fears
effectiveness of air campaign hinges on exploiting local vulnerabilities , *writers* say
@entity3 should accelerate transfer of excess military equipment to @entity114 forces , they argue
