it 's a big motivation to have him back because i always like to have the best riders in my garage			0
" @entity8 is one of them			2
i assume trying to beat me will be a big motivation for him			0
for @entity10 , it will be a good thing , that 's the most important thing			2
" @entity8 won 46 races in his seven years at @entity10 , but his final season was blighted by injuries and @entity6 took full advantage			1
the @entity54 lost his crown to @entity56 last year but tops this season 's standings by 23 points from @entity20 's @entity60 with five wins and four second - placings from 10 of the 18 races so far			1
@entity8 is eighth overall , but still ahead of @entity6 's 10th - placed @entity65 teammate @entity64 , who will leave @entity10 at the end of this season			1
" someone who has talent normally keeps it and does n't lose it like this in two years , " @entity6 said of @entity8			1
" he is still young enough			0
he is 33 , he has won a lot of races			0
with the @entity10 a better bike this year , it will be easier for him			2
" it 's true that us younger riders are getting stronger , more experienced and more consistent , but we have to remember that @entity8 has won a lot of races			2
we have to respect that and keep it in mind			0
" the 25 - year - old missed out on a podium place at @entity87 last year when @entity64 passed him to take third , but won the @entity65 race in 2009 and has twice been third himself			1
" i really enjoy riding the @entity90 track , and have good memories here from my podiums in 2008 and 2010 and my great win in 2009 , " @entity6 said			0
" last year i really struggled with grip in the race so i hope we can improve that this year			0
i 've had a nice break but also been training to make sure i 'm fit for this weekend ! " @entity20 's @entity56 and @entity60 have won the last two @entity87 races , and both are seeking to cut @entity6 's lead following @entity33 's midseason break			1
" in these two weeks i was able to relax a little , enjoy time with friends and get back into my training , " @entity60 said			0
" at this time of year , @entity87 is normally very hot so fitness is always key			0
i enjoy riding at this track and i 've had good results in the past			0
i am really looking forward to this race and will fight to win and maintain the consistency we have showed in the first part of the championship			0
" @entity56 is 32 points adrift of @entity6 in third place despite winning four races this season , which will be his last as he plans to retire after the final race in @entity118 at the relatively young age of 27			2
" i 'm not the biggest fan of @entity87 , mainly because we do n't go on the historical track but the infield and in the wrong direction , " said @entity125 's two - time world champion			1
" the track is very flat and plain , also very tight			0
there are a couple of corners that can be fun but the majority are difficult , tight and there is n't any natural flow to the track			0
