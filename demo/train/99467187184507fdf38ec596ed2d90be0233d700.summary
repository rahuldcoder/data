editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is the broadband television network of vice			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			2
we believe that this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			2
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- the first time i heard anything about people living in the sewers in @entity25 was back at the beginning of the ' 90s			1
the sewage system running under @entity30 's streets was filled with packs of kids living waist - deep in human waste and taking in copious amounts of glue and crack in order to cope			1
this was at the height of @entity25 's @entity40 , and the whole reason street kids had moved into the sewers in the first place was to get away from the violence above ground			1
but then the paramilitary death squads who had chased them off the street started coming into the pipes and shooting them or dousing them in gasoline or raping them			0
the sewer kids became a fairly big humanitarian story in the media for a while , with networks in @entity60 and @entity61 sending in tv crews to cover it and folks setting up charities abroad			1
then , as happens with news stories , it fell off the radar , and i guess people kind of thought the problem had been resolved , if they thought of it at all			0
but what had actually happened was , about six months after all the stories aired , the death squads went in , armed with the whereabouts of the sewer - kid hot spots , and carried out massive reprisal killings			0
there was some talk in the government about cracking down on the death squads , but by all accounts , soldiers and off - duty cops made up a good part of most squads			0
so the situation just stagnated while the world turned its attention elsewhere			0
see the rest of @entity91 at @entity9 when we went into the sewers and started talking to people , nobody wanted to be anywhere near our camera			1
having heard stories about the last time cameras came down , they were all sure that the police would figure out where they were hiding from our footage and come in to beat the ( expletive ) out of them ( the fact that they were all cracked out of their skulls probably did n't help with the paranoia either )			0
we took great pains to obscure the locations of their homes , but the only reason any of them talked with us was because we went down with @entity116			0
we had mixed feelings about @entity116 , or " @entity118 " as he prefers to be called , when we met him			0
he was constantly mugging for the camera and repeating the same well - rehearsed speeches about the kids ' living conditions ( " their only food is trash , their only music the honking of the city bus ... " ) , calling us at our hotel when he 's on the local news , etc. the thing is , though , he is seriously one of the only people in the country who 's done anything about the situation in the sewers			1
we all snickered at the meditation tapes and the @entity140 jumpsuit , but once we got down into the pipes , not only did all the kids know and trust him , they ran to him like he was made out of crack .			2

@entity9 goes *underground* and meets kids who are living in sewers to escape violence
drug use *rampant* as kids cope with living among feces , rats and fear
one man has *dedicated* his life to helping the kids get back on their feet
