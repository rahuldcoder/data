an @entity4 prison teacher who said she was raped by an inmate is at the center of a legal controversy in which the state is accused of trying to dismiss her negligence lawsuit on the grounds of " it 's a prison , this will happen , " her attorney contends			1
that claim , by attorney @entity14 , also was made tuesday by an @entity4 newspaper columnist , who criticized the @entity4 attorney general 's office			1
" @entity19 's reasoning is essentially this : the woman knew she was in a prison , so what did she expect ? " wrote @entity22 in the @entity23			1
" on tuesday , @entity4 attorney general @entity26 , a former prosecutor , disputed those characterizations			1
" our office was disappointed to see a misleading opinion piece that was recently published regarding the brutal assault of a @entity35 employee that occurred in january 2014 , " a statement released by his office said			1
" the attorney general 's office is taking affirmative steps to make sure that justice is served for the victim of this heinous crime			1
we would ask all parties to respect the integrity of the legal process			2
" a federal judge on monday heard arguments from the teacher 's attorneys and the attorney general 's office on the state 's request to dismiss the teacher 's lawsuit			1
on thursday , @entity54 district judge @entity53 rejected the defendants ' motion to dismiss the case , saying the suit " contains sufficient allegations " against each state defendant			1
the judge noted the suit " sufficiently alleges facts that plausibly suggest " that warden @entity67 , deputy warden @entity68 and two supervisors " acted with deliberate indifference to the dangerous situation in which @entity66 was placed , " the ruling said			1
the controversy focuses on statements that assistant attorney general @entity72 wrote in a december 19 motion to dismiss the teacher 's lawsuit against the state , the warden of the @entity78 -- @entity79 , and other prison personnel			1
the instructor who said she was raped was assigned to teach in a medium - security unit that houses sex offenders and special needs prisoners , including those who are mentally ill , disabled and in need of protective custody , court papers said			0
the teacher is an @entity91 " employee who routinely worked at the prison complex , " @entity72 wrote			2
" by being placed in a classroom at the complex , the officers were not placing @entity66 in any type of situation that she would not normally face			0
the risk of harm , including assault , always existed at a prison like @entity79			2
" @entity72 's motion also said the teacher 's suit " does not even specifically allege that any of the individual defendants was responsible for assigning @entity66 to utilize classroom 2 in the @entity105 , " where the alleged rape occurred			2
the teacher has been distressed by the state 's effort to dismiss her case , according to @entity14 , her attorney			1
" it 's shocking , it 's horrific and it increases her injuries , " @entity14 told @entity6 about the language used by the attorney general 's office			1
" for the most part her physical injuries have healed , but the emotional part of this has tore my client 's life up			0
" absolutely , it 's blaming the victim , " he added			0
" it feels like 1952 is what it feels like			0
it feels like a view of the world that i thought we got past			0
this is not the victim 's fault			0
" @entity138 is a bad place			0
i get it , " he said			0
" this is not a training corrections officer			0
this is a teacher , a civilian			0
they had a duty to protect her , and they failed in every manner			0
" the inmate , @entity150 , now 21 , is charged with rape , assault and other charges in a january 30 , 2014 , attack on the teacher at @entity156 in @entity157 , and he has pleaded not guilty			0
a pretrial conference is set for february 23			0
@entity150 was sentenced to 30 years in march 2013 as a result of a daytime home invasion in which he " raped and savagely beat a woman in front of her young child , " the teacher 's lawsuit said			0
on that january 2014 morning , the teacher was administering a @entity169 test to six or seven inmates , including @entity150 , court papers said			0
the instructor was n't trained in self - defense or how to control the movements of inmates , papers said			0
she could n't use the usual instructional space -- a visitation room with big windows for guards to observe the class -- because the prison was holding an awards ceremony in the room that day , the lawsuit said			2
instead , the teacher was assigned a classroom that was n't monitored by security cameras and was in a remote location not monitored by prison guards , the suit said			1
the prison gave the teacher a radio to use in case an inmate " acted up , " the suit said			1
the inmates arrived to the class unescorted , the lawsuit said			0
after the inmates finished the test , all but @entity150 left the classroom unescorted and returned to their dorms , the suit said			2
@entity150 asked the teacher if he could use the bathroom , located outside the classroom , but after the teacher got up from her desk , @entity150 grabbed her from behind , pushed her to the ground and stabbed her multiple times in the head and hands with a pen , the suit said			2
the teacher screamed and " began to bleed profusely , " but @entity150 " was stronger and he choked her and slammed her head in the floor multiple times , " the lawsuit said			0
the teacher " stopped fighting hoping to simply survive , " and then the inmate raped her , the suit said			2
the instructor is seeking unspecified damages in her lawsuit against the state			2
in court papers , the attorney general 's office argued that the teacher " can not allege facts sufficient to satisfy " her claim that the @entity35 created " the danger that allowed for her to be assaulted			1
" the state also argued that the teacher " has attempted to recast absolutely routine prison events , " court papers said			1
" the problem with @entity66 's repeated allegation in this regard is that it is impossible to conclude that such a dangerous situation would have been known and obvious to the defendants without also being known and obvious to the @entity66 , a teacher who worked on a daily basis in the same environment as the defendants , " the attorney general 's office said in court papers			1
the instructor accused the prison and the state of negligence , false imprisonment and violation of her civil rights , court papers said			1
" after being moved from the visitation room and during the approximate 1Â½ hours ( the teacher ) administered the @entity261 exam in @entity262 , not a single corrections officer entered the classroom to perform a security check on the inmates and the welfare of ( the teacher ) , " the lawsuit said			0
@entity6 's @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report from @entity4 .			1

@entity54 judge says suit " contains sufficient allegations " against each state defendant .
@entity4 columnist accuses the state of arguing " she was in a prison , so what did she expect ? "
attorney general : " our office was disappointed to see a misleading opinion piece "
