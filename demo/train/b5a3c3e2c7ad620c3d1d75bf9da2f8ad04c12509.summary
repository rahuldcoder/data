@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 met her husband , @entity4 in @entity5 in 1962			1
they have been married for 47 years			1
it was on the set of splatter flick " @entity10 " -- she was the shy set decorator ; he was the ambitious rookie director			2
they began dating and three months later she became pregnant and the couple married			1
that was 47 years ago and since then the retiring artist has become something of a chronicler of the extraordinary @entity3 family , which includes her flamboyant @entity23 - winning husband , daughter , @entity25 and actors @entity27 and @entity28			1
life with @entity4 has also allowed her a ringside seat during the making of some of the most revered films in cinematic history			1
most famously , she was in the @entity36 in 1976 during the notoriously difficult production of " @entity38 , " the war epic that almost destroyed @entity4 ' blossoming career			1
her little camera captured revealing footage of her husband as he and his actors and crew unraveled psychologically , much like the characters in the film			1
the footage was subsequently immortalized in the documentary " @entity49 : a filmmaker 's @entity38			1
" here @entity3 talks exclusively to @entity2 about her pride at seeing @entity25 win an @entity23 , what @entity4 is really like and just how close " @entity38 " came to disaster			1
the screening room : is @entity4 different on set than at home ? @entity3 : no. i think because he spent his life as a director it 's just in his nature			1
it 's in his blood			2
so , when he gets home he 's directing the dinner , where we are gon na sit , what we are going to eat			2
i 've adjusted to it , so now it 's really funny			2
@entity74 : what does @entity4 enjoy most in life ? @entity77 : people might not realize what a good sense of humor he has			1
he really likes to sing , he can sing a song about anything			2
he 'll make up a song , set to a major show tune about anything			2
if he were here this moment he could make up a song about you			2
@entity74 : do his films mirror life ? @entity77 : definitely the ones he has written ; the original pieces resonate with his life and aspects that reflect the way his life has evolved			1
he does address the issues -- both the positive and the darker side too			2
i think " @entity104 " was a raw example of his experience at weddings , with family , and he just took his experiences and viewed those characters with the familiar aspects that he had known			2
@entity74 : what was @entity4 ' inspiration for " @entity38 ? " @entity77 : after making " @entity104 , " " the godfather : @entity116 " and " @entity115 , " in which he felt like so many of the scenes he was shooting were inside these dark rooms and were about the complex relationship between the characters , he had the idea that he was going to go out to the @entity36 on location and make this big shoot about the green landscape and everybody was going to be out in the sun -- light , expansive , exciting			1
just a fun , big war film			1
but once he got out there , he found that he got delving into the research for the material -- he realized this was no lightweight thing			2
this was a war and people lost their children , sons , husbands			0
he realized it had more serious themes and considerations and it took him deeper and deeper into himself , the issues of life and death and all the heavy questions of war an epic brings to life			1
@entity74 : how did " @entity38 " affect @entity4 ' state of mind ? @entity77 : it was a journey for him up the river i always felt			1
he went deeper and deeper into himself and deeper and deeper and deeper into the production			0
it just got out of control			0
he did n't have the ending			0
he did n't know how to deal with it			0
the script was evolving and the scenes were changing -- it just got larger and more complex			0
and little by little he got out there as far as his characters			0
that was n't the intention at all at the beginning			0
@entity74 : tell me about how the documentary you shot while @entity4 was making " @entity38 " came about			1
@entity77 : i never intended to make the documentary of all documentaries			0
i was just trying to keep myself occupied with something to do because we were out there for so long			0
i just had never shot a documentary before			0
they wanted five minutes for a tv promotional or something and i thought sooner of later i could get five minutes of film and then it went on to 15 minutes			1
i just kept shooting but i had no idea ... the evolution of myself that i saw with my camera			0
so , it was a surprise for both of us and a life changing experience			1
@entity74 : in what way was it a life - changing experience ? @entity77 : when you do something that 's the most extreme and hardest thing you have ever done -- everything is in jeopardy ; your personal life , your financial life is in jeopardy and people 's lives were literally in jeopardy			1
two people lost their lives in that production , in the course of building			0
it involved 700 people to build the temple and there was an accident			0
so , it was a powerful experience and i think we came back in a new place			0
when you stretch yourself that far , you are able to come back in a deeper more thoughtful way			0
@entity74 : @entity4 is known to fight for his actors , like when he insisted on having young unknown @entity213 in " @entity104 " against the studio 's wishes @entity77 : i think his vision is extremely clear			1
that is just the way his life is			2
so , when someone says you ca n't have the green chair on this set , that is n't acceptable to him			0
he just does n't see it that way			0
it is the way his vision perceives it and there are n't any alternatives			0
so , if people say " no " to him , he just brushes that aside and he pays no attention			0
@entity74 : what 's it like to watch your children , @entity234 and @entity25 who are both film directors on set ? @entity77 : it has been deeply satisfying for them to find their way and find their voice , i think particularly for @entity25			2
i shot a documentary for " @entity245 " and then also " @entity246 , " so i was there seeing her blossom and emerge			0
@entity74 : what was it like seeing @entity25 win an @entity23 for @entity251 for " @entity252 " in 2004 ? @entity77 : well , i was deeply thrilled , particularly because she 's a woman and i thought it was so touching that the children actually do reflect their parents and their upbringing and their parents ' abilities do seem to have been passed on to their children			0
it was very emotional moment to see her			0
especially because @entity4 won a screenplay @entity23 at the same age , both 32 , so that was a touching circle of life .			1
