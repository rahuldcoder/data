@entity0 , @entity1 -- a convicted computer hacker from @entity4 testified tuesday in @entity5			1
@entity7 's preliminary hearing about six days of chats he conducted with someone who claimed to have leaked classified information and was " looking to brag about what they had done			1
" @entity13 said he traded instant messages in a chat format with someone self - identified as @entity17			1
@entity13 testified that based on an e-mail he received from @entity7 , as well as an examination of @entity7 's @entity21 page , that @entity17 was @entity7			1
the testimony came on the fifth day of the preliminary hearing , which will determine if @entity7 proceeds to a full military court - martial			1
@entity7 is accused of stealing and leaking more than a quarter of a million classified documents from the @entity26 and the @entity27 to the @entity29 website , the biggest intelligence leak in @entity32 history			1
@entity34 special agent @entity33 later testified that the chat logs that @entity13 provided to the @entity34 largely matched chat logs found on @entity7 's computer in @entity38			1
the prosecution did not ask @entity13 any specific questions about the chats themselves , but did establish that he was diagnosed with @entity43 's syndrome and takes medication for it			1
at one point he admitted overusing his medication to the point that his parents became concerned and he eventually was put in an involuntary psychiatric hold for three days			2
the only possible signs of his medical condition evident in court was his often halting speech and his unusual turn of a phrase			1
for example , when the prosecutor swore him in and then said " you make take your seat , " @entity13 responded , " that i shall			2
" when the defense cross-examined @entity13 , he read portions of the chat logs that seemed to indicate that he was not being completely forthcoming with @entity7 about why he wanted to know details about the leaks			1
at one point @entity13 wrote , " i 'm a journalist and a minister			0
you can pick either , and treat this as a confession or an interview ( never to be published ) & enjoy a modicum of legal protection			0
" but @entity13 , within a month , had given the chat logs to both @entity34 investigators and @entity76			0
before @entity13 took the stand , another @entity34 special agent , @entity78 , testified that @entity13 was a confidential informant for the command but was not paid for information			0
he was reimbursed for normal expenses			0
at one point @entity7 's lead attorney , @entity82 , implied @entity13 was asking @entity7 questions to get him to reveal how he planned to release classified information			1
@entity82 asked @entity13 why he wanted to know , and @entity13 replied that he " asked out of curiosity , i am a curious individual			0
which has been amply evidenced by my actions			0
" because of @entity13 's habit of answering yes or no questions with long responses , the cross-examination sometimes got contentious , but not to the point of anyone getting angry or raising their voice			2
near the end , @entity82 had to repeatedly ask a question regarding why someone might want to communicate with a minister			0
finally both the investigating officer and the prosecutor made suggestions about how @entity82 might better phrase the question			0
@entity13 answered without further problems			0
by 3:30 tuesday afternoon , the prosecution said it was finished presenting witnesses			0
@entity82 plans to call three witnesses starting wednesday morning			0
testimony on thursday began with @entity112 , who was @entity7 's team leader in the secure computer room in @entity38 , as well as earlier , when they were at @entity115 in @entity116			1
she told of incidents of erratic behavior on the part of @entity7 that led her to report that she felt @entity7 should n't be handling classified information			1
the @entity34 private faces 22 charges , including aiding the enemy			0
he 's accused of stealing and leaking the cables while serving as an intelligence analyst in @entity38 in 2009 and 2010			2
if convicted on all counts , he could face the death penalty			2
however , @entity34 prosecutors have signaled they will not recommend death in the event of a conviction , and it is unlikely they would be overruled by a senior officer			0
@entity2 's @entity136 and @entity137 contributed to this report			2

former hacker says he traded e-mails with someone he *believes* was manning
witness says @entity7 *punched* her in the face
documents found on @entity7 's computers were seen later on @entity29 , investigator says
the testimony came in a hearing to determine if @entity7 will face a court martial
