the search for the missing @entity4 plane will be entering a new phase that will use private contractors and may cost about $ 60 million , @entity1 prime minister @entity0 said monday			1
" i regret to say that thus far none of our efforts in the air , on the surface or under sea , have found any wreckage , " he said			1
the new phase will focus on searching the ocean floor over a much larger area -- 60,000 square kilometers , a process that will take about six to eight months			1
" we do not want this crippling cloud of uncertainty to hang over this family and the wider traveling public , " he said			2
it is " highly unlikely " that any debris will be found on the ocean surface , @entity0 said			0
by this time , most of the debris will have become waterlogged and will have submerged , he said			0
as such , authorities will be suspending aerial searches			1
words of praise @entity32 's government has been widely criticized over its handling of the search for missing @entity35 and disclosures of its investigations			1
but on sunday , @entity40 president @entity39 had words of praise during a visit to the southeast @entity44 country			1
he said the @entity32 government has been " forthcoming " with the @entity40 about the information it has			0
" the @entity32 government is working tirelessly to recover the aircraft and investigate exactly what happened , " @entity39 told reporters			0
he reiterated that the @entity40 would continue to aid in the search and offered condolences to loved ones of those lost			1
narrowed search nears end @entity39 's visit came as the initial search by the @entity58 neared its end			1
the submersible , which is on contract to the @entity62 , had been scouring the ocean floor for traces of the plane			2
previously , another device , a towed pinger locator , detected signals that officials believed were from the jet 's flight recorders , which determined the current search area for the @entity58			1
the plane disappeared on march 8 after leaving @entity73 , @entity32 , for @entity74			2
preliminary report @entity32 prime minister @entity76 has said a preliminary report on the plane 's disappearance will be available to the public next week			1
he also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week , his office said			0
the report has been sent to the @entity85 , the @entity87 body for global aviation , but not yet made available to the public			0
the @entity87 organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by @entity32 that the aviation world needs to look at real - time tracking of commercial aircraft			0
it 's the same recommendation that was made after @entity98 went down in the @entity99 in 2009			2
" anytime there is a tragedy like this , we ought to also reflect on what can be done going forward to prevent something similar from happening again , " @entity39 said			0
" that discussion has begun in @entity32 and around the world , and we 'll see what improvements might be recommended to continue improving aviation security			0
one thing is already clear , however , is that large international efforts like this search operation benefit from existing partnerships among nations			2
" why did n't emergency beacon work ?			0

new phase will take about six to eight months
authorities will be suspending aerial searches
