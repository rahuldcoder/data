-- on december 30 2007 , incumbent president @entity1 was announced the winner of @entity4 's highly contested presidential elections			1
against a backdrop of decades of economic frustration and simmering ethnic tensions , the violence that ensued , largely along ethnic lines , shocked both the nation and the world , threatening to set progress of the development community 's golden child back by decades			0
the violence shook @entity4 's national identity to the core			1
more than 1,000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in the chaotic bloodbath that followed			0
gangs took to the street armed with clubs , machetes , bows and arrows , hacking people to death , burning homes and destroying the country 's infrastructure , so critical to the region 's stability			0
on march 4 , @entity4 will once again cast their votes for president			1
and despite tremendous efforts to prevent a repeat of the previous catastrophe , pre-election tensions are mounting			0
in august 2012 , at least 50 people were killed in a land dispute between the @entity44 and @entity45 people in the @entity47 region , and in september , deadly riots were triggered by the killing of a @entity50 cleric in @entity51 , sparking fears that a bloody election could be repeated			0
yet @entity4 's tech - savvy activists are determined to prevent their nation slipping into chaos and with up to 93 % of @entity4 using mobile phones , they 're harnessing the power of technology to monitor elections , report incidents of violence and encourage a peaceful process			1

the @entity75 enabled citizens across the nation to report incidents of violence by @entity79 or email			1
reports were compiled into an online map , providing the most comprehensive picture of the true situation in an environment where official sources were understating its true extent			0
the @entity72 team have ramped up their efforts in preparation for this year 's elections			0
in partnership with a @entity4 ngo , the @entity94 , they 've developed @entity95 , which has already been deployed for the @entity4 constitutional referendum and elections in @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			2
as well as enabling citizens to monitor elections in near real - time , they have engaged more traditional election observers who are able to verify and amplify messaging to security personnel and electoral authorities in the event of outbreaks of violence			1
by engaging with authorities and making their responses visible , it is hoped that the platform will shine a light on the electoral process and enable greater public scrutiny and more rapid response			0
aware of the powerful influence that new media such as online forums and the blogosphere had in both inciting and dampening violence in the last election , @entity124 's @entity123 , a hothouse for tech innovation in @entity4 , is piloting an initiative called @entity134 , which is monitoring and reporting hate speech that could trigger violence this year			1
incidents will be integrated into the @entity95 platform with the hope of limiting or thwarting the harm they may cause			0

the @entity156 , of which i am executive , is a grant - making foundation that funds technology - driven projects that bring about social change in @entity162			0

the platform also collates the responses of young people , using them to initiate debate around key political issues affecting them and to inform and lobby those in charge			0

built on a violence - interruption approach that has been used in contexts as differing as @entity192 and @entity193 , the intervention combines targeted sms with intensive on - the - ground work by existing peace builders and community leaders to target potential flashpoints of violence			2
as well as encouraging users to vote , the platform sends out violence - prevention messages , provides civic education and updates communities about relevant peace - building activities , with the aim of de-escalating tensions and reducing the potential for conflict			1
several international interventions are complementing this wide range of home - grown initiatives			0
@entity214 's @entity4 elections hub enables voters to register online , receive sms confirmation and locate polling stations on a map , while @entity219 has launched a dedicated @entity4 election 2013 channel , in collaboration with @entity223			1
social media is also contributing towards a transparent and accountable process			0
over 25 % of @entity4 are now online			2
@entity4 has an estimated 11 , 000 bloggers and almost 2.5 million @entity227 were sent by @entity4 in just the last three months of 2012 -- many based around political messaging			2
social media has been shown to influence government , with the # 140friday discussions around the fairness of government tenders being credited with an increased allocation of government contracts to @entity4 companies			2
mp @entity238 was identified as an alleged inciter of violence through a video clip captured by mobile phone at a rally			0
it is well known that alternative media often does n't reach poorer communities , which include the slums where there were severe outbreaks of violence in the aftermath of the last elections			2
both social and traditional media also greatly contributed to inciting and escalating the violence in 2007/8			0
whilst it 's impossible to predict how @entity4 's march election will be acted out , one can be certain that any atrocities will be committed under the public scrutiny of a tech - savvy society			1
and as @entity162 's most technologically innovative nation goes to the polls , we can only hope that tech - driven interventions will contribute towards a peaceful process			0
