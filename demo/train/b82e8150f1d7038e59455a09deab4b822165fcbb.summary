growing up as a child in @entity2 , it was evident that the current president of @entity4 , @entity3 , was first perceived by majority of @entity4 people as a shy , reserved , introverted , weak , and hesitant child			1
he seemed to inherit none of his father 's ( @entity10 ) or his brothers ' ( @entity12 and @entity13 ) intelligence , strength , and leadership skills			0
even @entity3 's physical appearance — his tall and thin frame — added to his image as a frail person in the eyes of the majority of @entity4 people			1
but , more fundamentally , the invisible hand of history would soon sweep away these perceptions and prove the majority wrong			0
how did the blue - eyed , tall , @entity26 - educated ophthalmologist and reserved @entity3 , the one who was trained as a doctor to diagnose and eradicate diseases , so misgovern the domestic , regional , geopolitical and socio - economic affairs of @entity4 ? how did the soft - spoken , withdrawn @entity3 , who favors a thin mustache , transcend into one of the most despised political figures of his generation ? before @entity3 became president , he was viewed by various @entity4 social groups as rather bookish , not someone with the instincts or the drive to lead a country			1
even a sympathizer with the @entity3 regime , an @entity43 named @entity44 said to me : " @entity3 can not stand against powers such as @entity47 and the @entity48			2
we need a leader who is strong like @entity13			0
" " he 's certainly not a leader , " my cousin ( who was later killed in the recent uprising ) and his friends would say of @entity3 before he assumed power			1
@entity3 's destiny changed dramatically when he received a phone call from his father @entity10 in 1994			1
while studying at the @entity61 in @entity62 to be a professional ophthalmologist — and later live a luxurious life in the @entity26 — he was told to return to @entity2			2
the news of his older brother , @entity13 's death in a car accident had reached @entity3 and changed the direction of his life			2
@entity13 was a parachutist , an accomplished athlete , a ladies ' man , and an outgoing statesman being groomed to succeed his father as president			0
as @entity3 was far from the public eye and not as involved in political affairs , @entity10 and his old guard advisors trained @entity3 for several years in military and political affairs , along with @entity80 and secular ideals			2
the military and ideological training of the @entity85 ' old guard altered @entity3			2
however , @entity3 seems to have a distinct vision for @entity4 , other than the @entity80 agenda of his father 's old guard			1
while he endorsed the old guard 's use of hard power and mass repression , the lifestyle and wealth of the @entity26 still occupied @entity3 's mind when he assumed power			1
in his inaugural speech , @entity3 emphasized that it was time to begin modernizing @entity4			1
he stated : " i shall try my very best to lead our country towards a future that fulfils the hopes and legitimate ambitions of our people			0
" while @entity10 and the old guard favored the more fundamentally socialist agenda of the @entity108 and attempted to gain legitimacy and support through minorities ( @entity112 , @entity43 , @entity113 , and @entity114 ) , @entity3 focused on gradually adopting economic liberalization , neo-liberal and capitalist policies			1
this economic policy change intended to accumulate capital and wealth for the gilded inner circle , as well as to gain the support of other crucial social base — the business class — besides minorities			0
@entity3 miscalculated his policy changes though , as economic liberalization requires parallel political liberations			2
while @entity3 transferred public assets into the hands of his inner circle and top members of the business class , he resisted political liberations , equality , and redistribution of the wealth			2
he also increased the political repressions against political dissidents and human rights activists			0
those social groups , that opposed the trained doctor , became the diagnosed diseases which had to be eradicated			0
in addition , his policies tremendously increased the gap between the rich and poor			0
@entity3 also allowed @entity145 to enjoy greater influence in @entity4			1
@entity148 clashes and tensions between @entity3 and the old guard founding members of the @entity152 and socialist regime of @entity10 occurred			0
men such as @entity154 ( the former head of the @entity4 military intelligence and a close adviser to @entity10 ) , as well as hardliners such as @entity159 ( @entity3 's brother and commander of the @entity161 and the @entity163 's elite @entity162 ) disagreed with @entity3 's departure from socialist ba'ath policies			1
@entity3 and his inner circle did gain short - term benefits , however , the long - term consequences sparked in march 2011			2
when the popular uprising erupted , @entity3 focused on retaining the support of three significant social and political groups : the business class , the minorities ( @entity43 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , etc ) , and his hard power apparatuses ( the army , @entity175 , snipers , intelligence , police , etc )			1
additionally , @entity3 responded to the uprising with mixed reactions , on one hand offering promises and on the other enforcing mass repression			0
@entity3 also allowed the empowerment and return of the old guard and hardliners such as one of the orchestrators of the @entity191 massacre @entity154 and @entity159			0
for @entity3 , @entity12 , and the old guard , tolerance for dissidents and compromise meant encouragement of further revolt			0
@entity3 and the old guard managed to survive as @entity4 's civil war has entered into its third year			1
besides the mass repression and use of brute force , a crucial reason that the regime has been able to retain power is that a considerable amount of the business class , the minorities , and the army have not yet defected			0
secondly , @entity3 is cognizant of the international political structure and how he can use the strategic and geopolitical significance of @entity4 in order to gain financial , military , and intelligence support from the @entity145 , @entity215 , and @entity216			1
thirdly , @entity3 has been capable of creating distinct narratives among the minorities , the business class and the @entity26			1
finally , @entity3 has worked to pass off , to the international community , the idea that there is no better or more efficient alternative to his rule			0
as @entity3 has repeatedly argued , either he , or the " terrorists " will rule @entity4			1
he has infused this argument with a threat -- that if he does not rule over a unified @entity4 , he can instigate as conflict throughout the region and turn the nation into a conflagration .			0

@entity4 president @entity3 was seen as a reserved child , *writes* @entity233
but how did this @entity26 - educated ophthalmologist misgovern @entity4 , asks @entity233
@entity238 's distinct vision was to modernize @entity4 to *assimilate* the *western* world
