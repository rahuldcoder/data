-- in october , @entity2 's transition to pop music will be complete			1
the 24 - year - old singer / songwriter has long had one foot in country and the other in pop , sometimes to the chagrin of country fans			1
but with her fifth studio album , the october 27 release " 1989 , " @entity2 has eliminated her twang altogether			1
" at a certain point , " she told @entity13 in its new issue , " if you chase two rabbits , you lose them both			2
" instead , she 's taken inspiration from ' 80s pop acts like @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , and turned to producers and musicians like @entity26 and @entity27			1
's @entity28 to help her shape what she calls her " blatant pop " sound			1
along with her change in tune has come other shifts in @entity2 's life : she 's moved to @entity37 , has focused more on her friendships and has backed off dating ( at least for now )			1
where past @entity2 albums could fuel gossip for weeks over which song may be about which ex-boyfriend , " 1989 " has a different vibe			2
it 's not as " boy - centric " as past releases , @entity2 explained -- basically because there have n't been any boys			1
" i feel like watching my dating life has become a bit of a national pastime , and i 'm just not comfortable providing that kind of entertainment anymore , " @entity2 told @entity13			2
" i do n't like seeing slide shows of guys i 've apparently dated			0
i do n't like giving comedians the opportunity to make jokes about me at awards shows			0
i do n't like it when headlines read ' careful , @entity64 , she 'll write a song about you , ' because it trivializes my work			0
and most of all , i do n't like how all these factors add up to build the pressure so high in a new relationship that it gets snuffed out before it even has a chance to start			0
and so , i just do n't date			0
" do n't feel sorry for her , as @entity2 presumed readers might ; there 's plenty that she " really like ( s ) about my life right now			1
" " i have friends around me all the time			0
i 've started painting more , " @entity2 said			2
" i 've been working out a lot			0
i 've started to really take pride in being strong			0
" that strength was evident in her push to have " 1989 " made in the way she envisioned			0
when @entity2 turned the album in to the head of her record label , she was told that it was " extraordinary " and the best she 's ever done but also in need of a few country songs			1
" love you , " she recalled responding			0
" but this is how it 's going to be			2

@entity2 's next album will be " blatant pop "
the singer said she set out in that direction intentionally
along with a change in genre comes a change in songwriting focus
