-- the girl the @entity2 wanted dead has not only survived but was able to walk out of the hospital last week			1
but other highly publicized , vicious attacks on women and girls have not had such triumphant outcomes			1
@entity9 's ordeal is not over yet : doctors say the 15 - year - old campaigner for girls ' education , whom gunmen shot in the head as she rode a school bus in @entity18 , will be readmitted in late january or early february for more cranial reconstructive surgery			1
she left the hospital just days after gunmen attacked a van in @entity18 's @entity23 , less than an hour from the capital , and killed six women and one man who worked at a children 's community center			1
five of the dead were teachers ; two were health care workers			0
the center , a charity , offered a school for girls and vaccinations for polio , among other diseases , along with maternal health treatment			2
yet another attack unfolded around the time of @entity9 's release			1
@entity44 is reeling from the death of a woman who dreamed of becoming a doctor			0
brutally gang raped , mutilated and thrown from a bus , the physiotherapy student later died in a @entity52 hospital			0
her name was not made public in @entity44 , but her cause electrified the nation			0
her father , who sold family land to move his family to @entity59 from rural @entity44 to help his daughter realize her education dreams , is left heartbroken			2
" she wanted to be a doctor and said it was only a matter of a few years and that when she was a doctor ( all our suffering ) , it will end , ' " her father told the @entity62			0
" i remember asking her once , ' who are all your friends ? ' she replied , ' @entity71 , it 's only my books i am friends with			2
' " what all of these attacks have in common , along with their brutality , is that they are attempts at extinguishing the talent and potential of women -- or half of the population			1
in a world that needs every doctor it can find , every educator and politician who is willing to tackle the status quo , these young women offered a glimpse at a brighter future in which all can contribute			2
no less than investment oracle @entity92 made that very case recently , referring to the @entity95 , which has seen its share of less brutal attempts to hold women back			2
" what a waste of human talent ; 50 % of the talent of the country we pushed off in a corner for almost 200 years , " he said in an interview with @entity100			0
" it is one of the things that makes me optimistic about the future -- we are getting to the point we are starting to realize we need to use 100 % of our talent -- it makes me very optimistic , but we still have a way to go			0
" his words echoed those of the @entity118 in its annual @entity119			0
" the key for the future of any country and any institution is the capability to develop , retain and attract the best talent , " the report said			0
" empowering and educating girls and women and leveraging their talent and leadership fully in the global economy , politics and society are thus fundamental elements of succeeding and prospering in an ever more competitive world			1
" until now these horrific attacks on women and girls , attacks i have written about concerning @entity142 , have been seen as shameful and isolated incidents			1
but they are a shared loss in a globalized world			0
these young women and their legacies -- @entity9 , who will continue her fight , and the others , who will not -- are on the front lines of deciding what our world looks like			1
will young women who speak out on the need for education be stopped or celebrated ? will girls who dream of becoming doctors stay alive long enough to do so ? and when will we realize that their battle is one shared by everyone who dreams of a safer , more stable , more prosperous world in which more people have a stake ? perhaps @entity92 's words will help enlist more fighters in the cause			1
because the economic and human rights stakes are high			0
increasingly the world is recognizing the value and the contributions of girls and women			1
but progress is slow while violence is tolerated			1
and as the attacks in @entity18 show , educating girls remains a potentially deadly line of work			2
" they wanted to kill her , " said her father not long after gunmen shot his daughter			0
" but she fell temporarily			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

@entity193 : @entity2 failed to stop education advocate @entity9 by shooting her
@entity191 : similar attacks on other women and girls trying to reach their goals were fatal
attacks are efforts to stamp out women 's progress , rights and potential , she says
she says potential of half the population will not be realized if violence is tolerated
