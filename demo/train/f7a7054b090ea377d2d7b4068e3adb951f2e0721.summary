-- september 22 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : hi , i 'm @entity17 , and welcome to this wednesday edition of @entity0			2
we ask you guys a lot for your opinions on our blog			2
today , we 're gon na share some of what you 've had to say and ask for your thoughts on another story we 've covering			1
first up : war in @entity4 @entity31 : well , first up today , we 're going to @entity4			1
@entity33 and coalition troops have been fighting in that country for nine years			1
they 're battling the @entity36 , the militant group that used to control @entity4 and that refused to turn over @entity37 after the 9/11 terror attacks on the @entity33			1
right now , there are around 100,000 @entity33 forces in @entity4			1
and for them , living and operating in what can be a very violent setting , safety is no guarantee			2
a sad reminder of that fact yesterday , when a helicopter crash claimed the lives of nine @entity33 troops			1
officials are trying to figure out what happened			2
there were no reports of enemy fire when the helicopter went down			2
during this year , 2010 , the coalition has suffered more losses than any other year since the troops arrived in @entity4 in 2001			2
medal of honor @entity31 : we want to tell you about another military operation now			2
this one took place in 1968 , during the @entity66 , in the southeast @entity68 country of @entity69			2
a group of @entity33 was running a radar post on top of a mountain in @entity69			1
the @entity74 attacked it , and nearly all of the @entity33 were killed or wounded , except for one : air force chief master sergeant @entity77			1
he fought off the enemy , loaded the wounded men onto a rescue helicopter , and then climbed in			2
that is when a single bullet hit him , and sergeant @entity77 died in the helicopter			0
he was recommended for the @entity60 , the military 's highest award			1
but he did n't get it			0
you see , @entity33 troops were n't supposed to be in @entity69 during the @entity66 , so @entity77 's heroic act was a secret for decades			1
yesterday , during a ceremony at the @entity93 , president @entity91 presented the @entity60 to master sergeant @entity77 's family			1
the president said that the @entity60 pays tribute to sergeant @entity77 's courage , and it reflects the gratitude of the entire country			1
what 's @entity101 @entity102 , @entity15 : what 's the @entity101 ? the study of traits that are passed down from one generation to the next genetics that 's the word ! great @entity109 @entity31 : genetic engineering is when you use technology to take a trait from one thing and put it into something else			1
you might have seen that in a science fiction story somewhere			0
but could you see it on your dinner table ? that is what the @entity123 , the @entity123 , is considering			0
the agency is deciding whether or not to approve genetically - engineered salmon as food			1
you can see the difference in it			0
the modified salmon is twice as big , and it 'll get that big in half the time			1
the company that 's making the modified fish says this could help make the fishing industry more efficient and help make more food			1
but one big question : is it safe to eat ? some critics argue that there has n't been enough testing to see how this kind of genetic engineering will affect people or the salmon 's ecosystem			1
@entity148 and report @entity31 : so , would you eat it ? @entity151 took a vote on this : about 17 percent of readers said they 'd eat genetically - modified salmon " in a heartbeat			1
" almost half of them said " not on your life			0
" you can comment on our blog at @entity161			0
it 's the same place where you 're talking about the recession , which the @entity164 says has been officially over since june of ' 09			1
here 's what you say : no , the recession is n't over , according to 78 percent of you			1
now , these numbers were yesterday when we recorded the show ; they might 've changed a bit			0
fifteen percent of you think the recession is over			0
seven percent say they do n't know			0
@entity175 says " jobs are n't improving , and it seems like prices are getting higher in food , gas , insurance			0
if the recession were over , there 'd be more people with jobs and not so many struggling			1
" @entity186 says in his community , " there 's always at least one house with a foreclosure sign in the front yard , " and that before the recession , he " did n't have a clue that foreclosure existed			1
" saying the recession is over is n't accurate to @entity196 , though that 's what the economic studies say			1
@entity196 would like to " see more data behind the facts			0
" some of you , like @entity203 , say things are getting better			0
she writes that " jobs are bouncing back and doing well , and that with time , unemployment and home sales will improve			0
" but another student named @entity203 says the worst may be over , but she asks " how many budget cuts have been made since june of 2009 ? we still have a long way to go , " @entity203 writes			0
this day in history ( @entity214 ) september 22 , 1789 -- the @entity215 makes the position of postmaster general part of the new government september 22 , 1862 -- president @entity220 issues the first draft of the @entity222 , setting a date for the freedom of @entity33 slaves september 22 , 1961 -- president @entity226 creates the @entity227 , an organization of volunteers to work in underdeveloped nations @entity231 @entity232 , @entity15 : time for the shoutout ! what is @entity236 's job in the @entity33 government ? if you think you know it , then shout it out ! is he the : a ) secretary of transportation , b ) secretary of state , c ) cia director or @entity245 ) federal reserve chairman ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! secretary @entity236 is in charge of the @entity248			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! distracted @entity252 @entity31 : part of @entity255 's job is to make sure that the @entity33 transportation system is fast , efficient and safe			1
that last part is what he 's focusing on right now			1
yesterday , @entity255 kicked off a meeting about distracted driving			0
the meeting was in @entity5 , and this is an issue that we 've talked a lot about ; it 's one that you 've discussed on our blog			1
last year , we asked if you think the government should ban texting while driving			0
nearly 80 percent of you said yes			0
well , more than half the states agree			0
right now , it 's illegal to text when you 're behind the wheel in 30 states			1
the transportation department is looking for other ways to cut down on distracted driving			0
at this meeting yesterday , @entity255 announced new rules banning train operators and some bus and truck drivers from texting on the job			0
after the oil @entity31 : every year , people pitch in to help clean up @entity7 's beaches			1
it 's a project called the @entity287			1
usually , these volunteers are just picking up trash			1
this year , though , as you might guess , they have to deal with oil that has washed up on the beaches from the spill out in the @entity294			0
it creates some challenges , and it creates some opportunities			0
( @entity299 ) @entity300 , @entity301 vice president , @entity302 : i think this year 's been a little unusual year , with the oil spill and that type of thing , having to address those issues			1
@entity308 , @entity6 , @entity309 : we do have an information sheet today that is about oil and what to do if they encounter it , which is basically to leave it alone			2
@entity318 : this year , we are expecting probably the numbers to be a little bit down , especially as far as amount of litter picked up , because of @entity148 's work , you know , cleaning the beaches for the last several months			1
@entity326 , vice president , @entity6 , alabama tourism : i think the people here have had a feeling of frustration , because there really was n't anything that they could do			0
they could n't do anything about the oil			0
they could n't do anything about the tar balls			0
this is something that they can do to help us come back			0
@entity345 , owner , @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity302 : it was a really rough going , but we have come through it like we do			0
we live in the hurricane @entity353 just get up and you deal with it			0
@entity356 , vice president , the @entity358 : it 's particularly good to be here this year and to see the energy and momentum and dedication of the people in @entity7 to ensure that their beaches are cleaner and more productive than ever before			1
@entity366 : people want us to be ok , and they want to hear somebody say it 's ok , and we 've had a lot of signs that are saying that			2
the fishing is now re-opened			0
@entity374 : what 's wonderful about having children participate in these cleanups is that they are our future			2
and it reminds us adults that we have a legacy to leave to them , an environmental legacy , because if what we have now is not protected , they and their children and grandchildren will never have the opportunity to enjoy it			0
( @entity388 ) before we go @entity31 : okay , finally , you know how your parents told you not to play with your food ? they might make an exception for this art project			0
it 's called canstruction , and it 's on display at a mall in @entity399			2
each sculpture is made entirely out of canned goods			0
it 's actually part of a fundraiser that 's trying to fight hunger			2
after the exhibit ends , all the cans go to a local food bank			0
goodbye @entity31 : the goal of the project : to show that everyone can make a difference			0
you might 've seen that coming			0
either way , it 's all for now			2
we hope you 'll join us then			2
