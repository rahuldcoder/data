@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was supposed to be an ordinary night out with friends for 20 - year - old @entity5 but it ended with her lying on a railway track attempting to take her own life			1
@entity5 was at a bar , drinking with friends in @entity13 township , less than 40 kilometers outside @entity0 , @entity1 , when a man tried to ask her out			1
" i told the guy that no i 'm a lesbian so i do n't date guys and then he said to me , ' no i understand			0
i 've got friends that are lesbians , that 's cool , i do n't have a problem with that			2
' " @entity5 says he was nice and she trusted him , and they left the bar to go to the home of one of his friends , and that is where his friendly exterior turned nasty			1
" he said to me , ' you know what ? i hate lesbians and i 'm about to show you that you are not a man , as you are treating yourself like a man , ' " she told @entity2			1
" i tried to explain ' i 'm not a man			0
i never said i 'm a man , i 'm just a lesbian '			0
and he said , ' i will show you that i am a man and i have more power than you			0
' " then he raped her , she says , as his friend watched			2
@entity5 said : " [ @entity45 ] i went to the railway train road , because i was suicidal at the time			2
i was lying on the tracks			0
i think the train was 100 meters away from where i was			0
then some other guy came and grabbed me			0
" it is called " corrective rape " - where men force themselves on lesbians , believing it will change their sexual orientation			1
the extent of the problem is hard to know as @entity1 police do not compile corrective rape statistics separately from other rape cases			1
but human rights groups in the country -- where gay rights are constitutionally protected -- are outraged			1
@entity68 , of the @entity69 in @entity0 , which provides legal support for rape victims who can not afford good lawyers , said : " we believe that corrective rape warrants greater recognition on the basis that there are multiple grounds of discrimination			1
" it 's not just about a woman being raped in terms of violence against women , which is bad enough , but it 's also got to do with sexual orientation so it 's another ground or level of unfair discrimination leveled against lesbians			2
" it was not the first time @entity5 had been raped			1
she says she ran away from her home village , in the rural @entity95 , after the first rape when she was 15 years old and too afraid to press charges			2
she says running was easier than dealing with a community that did n't accept lesbians			2
she moved to @entity101 , a sprawling shanty town near @entity0 , @entity1 's " gay capital " where she hoped to find tolerance			1
instead , she was confronted by more hate			2
" being a lesbian in @entity13 is like you are being treated like an animal , like some kind of an alien or something , " she said			0
while there are no official statistics on corrective rape , there have been enough publicly reported incidents to spark widespread alarm			1
this time @entity5 is fighting back			2
@entity118 - based @entity117 recently conducted interviews in six of @entity1 's nine provinces and concluded : " @entity122 attitudes towards homosexual , bisexual , and transgender people in @entity1 have possibly hardened over the last two decades			2
the abuse they face on an everyday basis may be verbal , physical , or sexual -- and may even result in murder			0
" the group added : " this is a far cry from the promise of equality and non-discrimination on the basis of ' sexual orientation ' contained in the country 's constitution			0
" most known victims , like @entity5 , are poor and black and so are the perpetrators , prompting many to ask how a people who fought against discrimination during apartheid can today treat some of its most vulnerable in such a violent manner			2
@entity146 , @entity1 director at @entity117 , said : " we 've failed to make it understood that there is a price for rape			1
sexism is still deeply embedded here			0
there is still a strong sense among men that they have power over women , women 's bodies and there 's also a strong sense that there 's not going to be consequences because most often there are no consequences			0
" @entity167 estimates that half of @entity1 women will be raped in their lifetime			1
but corrective rape is not even recognized as a hate crime and rights groups say few victims report their cases to the police			1
in many @entity1 countries being gay is illegal			1
in @entity1 , those entrusted with enforcing the country 's " tolerant laws " now stand accused of re-traumatizing victims			2
" when a woman is raped she is re-raped by the system and for me this is a big thing because it 's a serious violation of our constitution and the duties that are placed on the state in terms of what the state needs to do for survivors , " @entity68 said			0
@entity2 saw the treatment meted out to survivors firsthand with @entity5 as she trekked from police station to police station trying to first find , and then get answers from , her investigating officer			1
he was the third assigned to her case since she reported the attack in december 2009 and she eventually found him at the sexual offences unit in @entity207 , a 30 - minute drive from her home			0
despite the sensitive nature of her case , he met her in the wide , open office			0
when @entity5 asked why the police had failed to interview her alleged attacker 's friend , who witnessed the rape , another officer in the room told her : " i never take a statement from a suspect 's friend			1
" he added : " the suspect 's friend is obviously going to say you are in a relationship with the suspect or that he did n't see anything			0
the only statements that are important here are the ones from your friend , a neutral person or a neighbor			0
not someone who was there watching while you were being damaged and he was n't helping			0
" @entity2 requested an interview with the investigator and was referred to his superiors , before being granted an interview with @entity1 's minister of police , @entity239 , who promised an investigation			1
" i feel bad , " the minister said			0
" i feel bad about all these things			0
that is why i 'm saying people who are responsible have a case to answer			0
" no action has so far been taken against the police officers who not only treated @entity5 with disdain but who she also had to push every step of the way to do their job			1
when they let her alleged attacker go without taking dna evidence , potentially crucial in proving his guilt , it was @entity5 who insisted they re-arrest him			2
after neglecting to question the eyewitness who was allegedly there throughout the incident , it was @entity5 who forced the police to talk with him			1
she says she sat in a car while they questioned him , as he leaned in through an open window to tell the police officer what he saw of the assault , forcing @entity5 to once again relive the experience			1
@entity1 's @entity276 was drafted in 2004 , granting seven fundamental rights to every victim of crime			1
among them is the right to be treated with fairness and with respect to your dignity and privacy			0
@entity5 says these rights are ideals she has never experienced			1
yet she 's determined to press on			0
she said : " they always get away with it			0
i 'm just pushing so that there will be a different story on my case			0
maybe if this guy could be sentenced or something happens to him i think a lot of my friends will report their cases because some of the lesbians , they do n't report their cases , they do n't go to the police station because they know that it will just be a waste of time			1
" nearly two years after reporting her case , @entity5 is still awaiting her day in court , still hoping for justice , and still fighting .			2

in @entity1 the full scope of ' corrective rape ' is not known because cases are not separated from other forms of rape
' corrective rape ' is where men rape lesbians in the belief it can can make them straight
@entity5 tells how she was raped and had to push police to investigate properly
in @entity1 , gay rights are constitutionally protected and activists want ' corrective rape ' to legally be a hate crime
