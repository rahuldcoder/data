-- @entity1 is an @entity2 who loves hiking , adventure , art and sports			0
at age 19 , he 's in an education program that bridges the gap from high school to getting a job			0
doctors diagnosed @entity16 , 19 , with autism when was 18 months old			1
the neurological disorder was diagnosed when he was 18 months old			0
@entity20 's epilepsy and autism were n't diagnosed until she was almost 3 years old			1
now 9 , she and her family still face many challenges in coping with her conditions			0
it 's been a year since the first @entity27 - declared @entity26			1
in those past 365 days , nobody has discovered the cause of autism , which the most recent statistics from the @entity32 suggest affects one in 150 children			1
nor has a cure been found			1
however , new research and major court decisions have emerged to explain further what may contribute to the developmental disabilities of the brain known as " autism spectrum disorders " or @entity41			1
one thing that has been known for a while is that there is not one type of autism , but rather several types under the autism umbrella , including @entity50 's syndrome , classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified ( @entity53 )			1
more and more doctors and researchers are referring to autism as autisms ( plural ) because each child 's case is different , as are the causes , helpful therapies and potential future cures			1
ireport.com : does autism touch your life ? while the past year has n't yielded definitive answers , new information about what may or may not cause autism , prevalence and accompanying issues like paying for treatment have made headlines			1
here are just a few : do vaccines cause autism ? in 1998 , a theory emerged that the measles - mumps - rubella ( @entity82 ) vaccine caused autism , the theory being that the vaccine lingered in the gut , causing gastrointestinal problems , and that those @entity89 problems led to autism			1
a few years later , the very small study that was the basis of this theory was debunked and discredited			0
however , this did not quash the belief among many parents that vaccines caused autism , leading them to stop or delay immunizing their children			1
since the first @entity26 last year , a couple of studies and a major court decision declared definitively that vaccines do not cause autism			1
in september , researchers in the @entity105 and @entity106 re-created the original 1998 study , even using one of the same laboratories to analyze their results			1
the study authors concluded that " no evidence " linked the @entity82 vaccine to autism or the @entity89 problems			1
while many experts said this study is conclusive and " puts the issue to rest , " some groups that hold to the belief vaccines are the cause of autism called the research flawed			1
another study , published in the march 2009 issue of @entity127 , provided an explanation of why the @entity82 vaccine does not cause @entity89 problems and autism			1
@entity131 , a researcher at @entity132 , suggested that he has found a reasonable explanation for why many children also have @entity89 problems			1
according to his research , a genetic variation of a protein called @entity138 contributes to both autism and @entity89 problems , rather than @entity89 problems causing autism			1
in addition , a decision inside a courtroom rather than a laboratory drew the conclusion that the vaccines do not cause autism			2
on february 12 , a special vaccine court ruled in three test cases , representing more than 5,000 families , that the " combination of the thimerosal - containing vaccines and the @entity82 vaccine are not casual factors in the development of autism			1
" it 's probably still too early to tell whether these rulings changed anyone 's opinions			0
" i do n't think they were important from the standpoint of changing the minds of those with firmly held beliefs regarding vaccines , " said dr. @entity163 , director of child psychiatry at @entity165			0
he said that it will not be until we find credible causes for autism that people can leave this debate behind			2
" we still support research that would potentially identify small groups with underlying medical or genetic conditions who may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of vaccines , " said dr. @entity178 , the chief science officer of @entity179 , the nation 's largest advocacy group			0
" for the vast majority of kids , vaccines are safe and we support vaccine programs , " @entity187 said , adding that more research into vaccines is needed			2
are autism rates going up ? using data from 2000 and 2002 , the @entity32 released a report two years ago with the statistic that one in 150 8 - year - olds have autism , up from the previous estimate of 1 in 166			2
what remains unclear is if the numbers really went up or if counting these children differently led to the increase			0
according to a study done by the @entity209 at the @entity210 and published in january , " the incidence of autism rose seven - to eightfold in @entity206 from the 1990s through the present			2
" " the incidence of autism has not yet plateaued , " said @entity211 , lead author of the study			2
" we do n't know the reason for the increase			0
" but she said that expanding the definition of autism and greater awareness and diagnosis alone ca n't account for the increase			2
" looking at the environmental cause of autism is the next logical step " to find more answers , she said			1
a @entity227 study from december seems to suggest the opposite			0
it concluded that the shift in age at diagnosis , " especially the earlier diagnosis at younger ages , artificially inflated the observance of autism in younger children			2
" dr. @entity238 , a child neurologist at @entity239 in @entity240 , @entity241 , has been treating children with autism for more than 30 years			2
he said he 's still not quite convinced that the incidence is going up either			0
one explanation is that the way autism cases were counted in the @entity32 study and in the @entity206 study are not the same			1
" we need to investigate if there 's a true rise , " @entity238 said			0
what are environmental factors ? in the past year , more has been said about exploring how environmental factors , in addition to genetic factors , may contribute to autism			1
@entity211 said environmental factors include anything that 's not in the child 's dna , from viruses and bacteria to chemicals in the brain or personal care products			2
she said more research needs to be done			0
@entity32 epidemiologist and autism researcher @entity267 said that any nongenetic factor , including a mother 's illness during pregnancy or treatment of a baby in the hospital during or after birth , are other possible environmental factors			1
the @entity32 is conducting a five - year study at six sites looking at genetic and environmental risk factors for autism			1
@entity179 also said studies should look more closely at environmental factors			2
" everything from vitamin d to folic acid , a mother 's health condition or pesticides " may play a role , said @entity187			0
her organization recently announced it is investing $ 5 million to fund studies on genetic and environmental risk factors for autism			1
how to afford therapies ? another issue that has gained momentum in the past year is how to pay for the therapies and treatment for children with autism and the now growing numbers of adults with autism			2
@entity307 , @entity20 's mother , is helping raise $ 10,000 for five families in her hometown of @entity310 , @entity311 , because she knows how difficult it is to pay for treatments that helped her daughter ( more information at @entity316 / )			0
@entity238 said that one of the ongoing issues for the parents of the children he treats is " what will we do with them as adults ? " he said there is an urgent need for developing programs for adults with autism to be productive rather than putting them in institutions			1
most of the 8 - year - olds who were counted in the @entity32 study in 2000 are now becoming young adults			0
however , there are few programs to help them when they are too old to receive therapies through the educational system			0
@entity187 said she 's encouraged to see the @entity340 administration earmark $ 211 million for autism research and more			2
according to the 2010 federal budget proposal , " the president is committed to expanding support for individuals , families , and communities affected by @entity347			0
" " one of the things that @entity340 featured in his plan is money toward adult services , " @entity187 said			0
@entity13 's mom wants her adult son to be the best he can and the happiest he can -- but she also wants him to be a productive citizen			0
" i want to get a job , " @entity13 said			0
" i want to be a designer -- i will have to learn how to be a designer			0
" he hopes to go to a college with special programs for students with disabilities			0
he 's already designed business cards for a few people ; his mom hopes this might be something he could do professionally in the future			0
aside from doing the morally right thing , @entity368 said , funding more programs for adults with autism makes economic sense			0
" if you get them employed , you wo n't have to pay for them forever , " @entity1 said , adding it 's much better to " turn these people into taxpayers instead of tax takers			0

*thursday* is second @entity26
in last 365 days , no cause or cure found , but baby steps made along the way
special vaccine court ruled in three test cases , found no link with autism
researchers look to environmental causes ; parents look for insurance coverage
