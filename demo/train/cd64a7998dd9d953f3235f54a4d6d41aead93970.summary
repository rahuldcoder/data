" the subtitles ran live on @entity100 tv and on the giant screens around the country , prompting fans to jeer , and toss beer and food at the screens			0
the snafu was blamed on researchers who copied the lyrics from the internet before the match between @entity96 and @entity113 , the @entity107 reported			2
@entity114 , a company that provided the subtitles , apologized and called it " an embarrassing mistake , " reported @entity117			0
