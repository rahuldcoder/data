-- @entity1 arrived in the @entity2 11 years ago , at the age of 9			1
" why did i move to the @entity2 ? i still do n't know			1
for a better education , for a better life , " she said			0
one of her biggest dreams was to join the @entity8 , but at 17 , @entity1 -- the first in her family to graduate high school -- discovered that she could n't enlist because she did n't have a social security number			1
" i had dreams , but i had no way to complete them , " she said			0
" sadly , my whole family is undocumented			0
" @entity1 soon moved back to her home country of @entity18 but now regrets doing so : " i 've been here for 10 months			1
i cry every night , missing my family , and @entity21 knows when iÂ ´ ll see them again			0
" when president @entity24 announced june 15 that some young immigrants would no longer be deported , @entity1 was happy			1
at the same time , she believed the policy change would not help her			0
" there 's no way back for me			0
how can i apply ? what can i do ? nothing			0
" @entity24 's announcement and the @entity33 's subsequent rejection of all but one provision of a controversial immigration law in @entity36 this week have brought the issue back into the spotlight			2
like @entity1 and others across the country , many of the @entity42 who posted their views had a personal stake in the broader issue of immigration			1
their opinions were nuanced and widely varied but had one thing in common : most did not believe that the recent changes and rulings will have a direct effect on them -- or would have helped them in the past			2
@entity58 of @entity59 , @entity60 , said she has had a years - long issue with immigration			1
" all immigration to these @entity2 should be done legally , abiding by the laws of our great nation , " she said			1
" my husband and i are doing exactly that , taking an excessively long time and great expense to do so			0
" @entity58 was married in @entity71 but has been waiting for three years for her husband to get a visa in order to live with her in the @entity2 " i realized , i must not be alone , as there are certainly other @entity2 who deal with the pains of having to make do and go through the motions of life while missing their loved ones so , " she said			1
even so , @entity58 said , she can understand why some people cross the border illegally			2
" they do n't all have motives to smuggle contraband into the country or undermine our homeland security			0
they are simply trying to find a way to survive , escape systemic violence within their own politically dysfunctional governments and make for a stable and happy family life for the ones they love , " she reasoned			0
@entity97 's mother sought out a new life for her family in @entity2			1
as a young child , @entity97 knew that her family could be sent home at any time			1
" being in a country illegally is a scary and difficult situation for children , and it is not a decision they made or were mentally equipped to make , " said @entity97 , whose family came from @entity104			1
" but for that same reason , i think adults who have made the decision to come to the @entity2 illegally have to face reality			1
" that reality includes the possibility of being deported			0
@entity97 no longer has to face that , since her mother married a @entity2 citizen : " it was an enormous sigh of relief to say the least			1
" her experience led her to get involved with advocacy groups			0
" i was involved in activism in favor of illegal immigration and the halt on deportations for a bit , but i made the decision to no longer support these groups , " she said			1
" i do n't agree with their strategies			0
there need to be more compelling arguments based more on logic and less heart			0
they want their supporters to feel bad for illegal immigrants , but no responsibility is taken whatsoever for the fact that an adult stayed here illegally			1
" at the same time , @entity97 was happy to see so much of the @entity36 law struck down			1
" i always thought the @entity36 law was a bit extreme and based on fear while targeting mostly one race / background , " she said			0
" while i never want anyone to ask my son for his birth certificate because he looks @entity152 , i want him to know that when you do something illegal , you will face negative consequences , and you should n't expect forgiveness , only hope for it			2
" even though the recent immigration decisions do n't affect him now , @entity158 believes they might have 20 years ago			1
now a @entity2 citizen living in @entity60 , @entity158 still recalls being stopped by the @entity161 in 1991 for four hours outside @entity162 , @entity36			2
" i was a citizen of the @entity163 , but i was a third - generation @entity164 of @entity166 ethnicity , " he said			0
" i do n't look ' white , ' and so i was held on the grounds that i was @entity18 until i could prove otherwise			2
" more than 20 years later , @entity158 said he is in favor of " comprehensive legal immigration and for strict compliance to immigration rules			2
" " i followed rules to become a @entity2 citizen , and i do n't think it is fair for someone to jump the line or not even stand in line , " he explained			2
@entity158 opposes " random stops " by authorities , however			2
" i am happy that the @entity33 ruling struck down three of the four major provisions			0
the fourth one , which they upheld , is precisely what impacted me and which i think is going to continue to be abused if it is not further challenged , " he said , referring to the controversial provision that allows police checks on people 's immigration status while enforcing other laws			0
@entity158 said he is " a little aghast " at the partisan nature of the immigration debate			0
" @entity197 immigration rules need to be a bipartisan effort at a federal level and and must follow a process that is fair to all , " he said			0
despite their different views and experiences , these @entity42 all want the same thing @entity1 wants			1
" i want my voice to be heard ; i want to chase my dreams ; i want my family to be free , and i want them to live the @entity2 dream , " she said .			2

@entity42 with varying personal experiences with immigration shared their views
@entity1 lived in the @entity2 illegally for 10 years , regrets returning to @entity18
@entity97 , a former illegal immigrant , opposes the *tactics* used by immigration activists
most did not believe recent immigration decisions would affect them today
