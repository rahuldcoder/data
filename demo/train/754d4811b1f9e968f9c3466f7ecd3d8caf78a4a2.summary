the @entity55 said in a statement the arrests are " unfounded and have unseemly goals			2
" " we do not understand the reasons why the @entity8 @entity31 has made a public statement in the spirit of the @entity66 , " said the statement , posted on the ministry 's website			1
" such incidents have occurred in the past , when our relations were on the rise			0
in any case it is regrettable that all these things are happening on the background of the ' reset ' in @entity4 - @entity8 relations announced by the @entity8 administration			1
" asked about the incident tuesday in an appearance with @entity80 foreign minister @entity79 in @entity81 , @entity4 foreign minister @entity76 said , " we still have not received an explanation			1

last week , president @entity149 and @entity4 president @entity150 spoke of strengthened ties between the former @entity66 foes after their meeting at the @entity154			2
however , court documents and @entity31 officials described a @entity4 intelligence operation straight out of a 1950s spy novel			1
according to the court documents , some of the suspects adopted phony identities , including those of dead @entity8 , and posed as married couples			1
the suspects engaged in secret communications including exchanges of bags , money drops and use of invisible ink , as well as more modern touches such as private wireless computer networks between specific laptops , the documents said			1
a decrypted message from @entity179 to two of the suspects said they were sent to the @entity8 for " long - term service , " one of the documents said			1
" your education , bank accounts , car , house , etc. -- all these serve one goal : fulfill your main mission , i.e , to search and develop ties in policymaking circles in @entity8 and send intels ( intelligence reports ) , " the document said			2
the @entity4 operation was believed to date back to the 1990s , the court document said			2
it added that the @entity142 conducted extensive electronic surveillance of the suspects for years , including secretly recording and videotaping them and surreptitiously entering residences to take photographs and copy documents			2
one of the suspects is @entity208 , a columnist for " @entity43 " for more than 20 years covering politics , immigration and other issues , her lawyer confirmed			0
@entity208 is married to @entity212 , another of the suspects arrested monday , and the couple resided in @entity215 , a @entity40 suburb			2

another document described alleged efforts to secretly get money to the suspects to fund their clandestine activities , including money drops involving exchanged bags in public places and other subterfuge			2
in one incident , @entity18 , the suspect still at large , received money from a @entity4 agent and buried it in a park in northern @entity26 , the document said			1
@entity225 and @entity224 later showed up at the park to dig up the money , the document said			2
