there may be a number of good reasons to vote against @entity3 , but based upon what we know so far , his honesty about his tenure at @entity7 does not seem to be one of them			1
let me acknowledge upfront what i have said several times on @entity16 : i have a past relationship with the top partners at @entity7 that is both personal and financial			2
i have worked with them in support of nonprofit organizations such as @entity23			0
i have given a couple of paid speeches for @entity7 dinners , as i have for many other groups			2
i was on the board of a for - profit child care company , @entity30 , that was purchased by @entity7			2
it was a transaction with financial benefits for all board members and shareholders , including me			0
so , yes , i have a bias			0
but let me also add how that bias plays out : i have come to admire and like the leaders of @entity7 because i have learned firsthand that in a private equity industry , where there are obviously some predatory companies , @entity7 stands out for the respect in which it is generally held and for the generous philanthropy of some of its partners			2
nothing i have seen so far has shaken that view			0
with that on the table , let 's turn to the controversy and offer answers to some basic questions : are president @entity52 and his team right to demand close scrutiny of @entity3 's leadership at @entity7 ? absolutely			1
@entity57 to @entity3 's candidacy is his claim that he will be better at creating jobs and growth than @entity52 because of his experience at @entity7			1
just as @entity63 have relentlessly questioned @entity52 's record ( often to the point of sheer demagoguery ) , it is absolutely fair to question @entity3 's			1
and given that critics have argued that @entity7 helped outsource jobs through its investments in the years immediately after @entity3 's departure to head the @entity71 , it would be a significant revelation if it turned out that in fact he had still played a meaningful role in the company			1
has @entity3 handled the scrutiny well ? no , he has n't			1
he and his team should have prepared a thorough , written record of his time at @entity7 and made it publicly available long before this stage of the campaign -- a record that would have explained in advance his accomplishments and failures while at @entity7 , the manner of his departure and the conflicts that have arisen over what he has said and filings @entity91 has made with the @entity93			1
had he been proactive in laying it all out , it is unlikely he would be facing the barrage of today			0
( in another life , i made a similar argument to @entity100 and @entity101 -- people i enormously respect -- over @entity103 and that went nowhere ; naturally enough , politicians are not inclined to put out documents that may be discomforting , even if they also help clear the air			0
) @entity108 : why @entity52 's @entity7 charges are working should @entity3 disclose his tax returns and other information relating to off - shore accounts ? yes , he should			1
like many others who have been financially successful and as a result have complicated financial histories , @entity3 has shown a deep reluctance to disclose anything more than the bare minimum and has only released his tax return for one year			1
but he is asking voters to entrust him with the most powerful and important office in the world			0
in return , voters have a right to know who he is and how he got here			0
put it out , take whatever hits are coming , and move on			0
if he has been as honest as all his friends believe , he will ultimately be a stronger candidate and can refocus on what matters : the country			0
has @entity3 basically lied about when he actually departed @entity7 ? has he tried to mislead the public or investors ? here we come to the heart of the recent controversy			1
i may be wrong but based on what we know so far , i would conclude that we do not have persuasive evidence to show that he has			0
@entity3 has argued for years that after he was called in to rescue the @entity141 in february 1999 , he turned his full attentions there and no longer exercised active management at @entity7			1
the story is a complicated one because @entity91 was a complex partnership and because the company filed various @entity93 papers after february 1999 still listing @entity3 in various key roles , including ceo and chairman			2
but if one takes time to look behind the @entity93 filings , what emerges is much more supportive of @entity3 's statements			1
@entity156 : @entity3 's painfully bad week when the story first broke thursday in the @entity158 suggesting that @entity3 and @entity91 had fudged , @entity16 asked if i would do some reporting			2
i reached two of the top people whom i know in the company and , on background , they told me the same story that @entity7 sources told @entity16 's @entity167 : when the call came from the @entity71 that february , @entity3 met with his partners and said he and wife , @entity170 , had concluded that they had to do this and as difficult as it would be for the partnership , he had to leave in a matter of several days			1
that set off consternation within @entity7 because the company had exploded in size and @entity3 was not only ceo ( or managing partner ) but was also deeply tied into a variety of investments and partnerships			1
the partners had to turn quickly to reorganizing their teams and the way they ran their business			0
had they known that one day @entity3 would be running for president , they might have acted with equal haste on cleaning up the many filings and paperwork that bore @entity3 's name but at the time , they did n't think that was an urgent task			1
so , as the company slowly unwound its records , some papers from @entity7 continued to list @entity3 even though he had left the partnership			1
a sloppy mistake ? yes			0
an attempt to mislead ? the evidence so far does n't show that			0
also of note : at the time , it seemed that he might return from the @entity71 to active management , but in any event , he did not			2
secondly , i do not know of ( nor is there any controversy suggesting ) his involvement in other companies during that time			0
as the @entity217 reports monday , there was an expectation at first that @entity3 might return to active management of @entity7 so he did not sever his ownership ties right away -- an additional reason why his name was not struck from documents for a while			1
the @entity217 account goes on to say there is no evidence that during this interim he was actively engaged in managing the firm			0
both partners with whom i spoke firmly and unequivocally said that after he physically left in february 1999 , @entity3 no longer made decisions for @entity7 regarding investments , hiring , firing or any other management issues			1
subsequent to that february , the firm in 2000 offered another round of financing and , according to @entity7 , the investors well understood that @entity3 was no longer actively managing the company			1
could these @entity7 partners now be lying ? possibly			2
on a rare occasion in the past , when i was wearing a reporter 's hat , a friend has lied to me for self - protection			0
but based on relationships over several years , i trust his or her account			0
even so , knowing my bias , you may well ask : is there any corroborating evidence ? as it turns out , there is			0
@entity256 , a respected website that nails candidates for inaccuracies , earlier investigated the whole issue of @entity3 's departure and reached a conclusion that he was telling the truth			2
last week , little noticed by @entity3 's critics , @entity256 went back , reviewed the evidence again , and based on what we know so far , reaffirmed its earlier conclusion			1
@entity256 's recent article was co-written by a man who was once a top investigative journalist for @entity16			0
( the piece last week also recalled an @entity273 report on the @entity71 that said in his early tenure at the @entity71 , @entity3 was working 112 - hour weeks to save the @entity276 games			1
does this sound like a man who was also managing a private equity firm on the @entity280 ? ) last week , in another article that critics tend to ignore , @entity281 reported that it had obtained confidential documents that @entity91 gave to prospective investors in advance of that seventh round offering in 2000			0
the prospectus is the way a company such as @entity7 informs possible investors who will manage their money			2
the prospectus listed 18 managers at @entity7 who would have responsibility			2
@entity3 's name was not among them			2
it remains possible , of course , that new evidence will emerge that could sharply contradict both @entity3 and @entity7			1
if so , that will be a whole new ball game			0
both he and the company would be grievously damaged			0
but judgments today can only be fairly made on the evidence at hand and the reputations of the people who are coming forward			0
from my perspective -- yes , with a bias -- the weight comes down on the side that as he has said all along , @entity3 ended his active management at @entity7 when he left for the @entity71			1
again , there are many other reasons why one might oppose his candidacy , but this does not strike me as a fair one			0
as long as fairness is the standard , it would be reassuring if some of the harshest critics of @entity3 and @entity7 would acknowledge their own biases			1
and for goodness sake , will the @entity52 campaign please withdraw its heavy suggestion that @entity3 could well have committed a felony ? that was an injustice to both @entity3 and the president			1

@entity52 campaign says @entity3 did n't leave @entity7 when he *joined* @entity71
@entity336 : so far the facts do n't support the @entity52 campaign 's charges
he says @entity3 has *mishandled* the response and should release more tax returns
@entity336 : @entity52 campaign should back off idea that @entity3 might be *guilty* of felony
