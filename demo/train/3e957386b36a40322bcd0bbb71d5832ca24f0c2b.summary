@entity0 -- it 's hard to imagine the president of the @entity4 on the " naughty step , " forced to stay there until he had repented for his behavior			1
but that 's more or less what has happened			0
@entity10 had to " clarify " ( in other words , backtrack on ) his newsworthy comment that there was a " question mark " over the suitability of @entity16 's and @entity17 as @entity19 sponsors			1
apparently he had actually first flagged his concerns four years ago , but the lure of sponsors ' cash far outweighed any considerations about growing obesity levels ... and apparently still does			2
however , now @entity10 is far from alone in questioning high - calorie , high - sugar fast food brands sponsoring the @entity19 and @entity27			2
the @entity28 made a high - profile intervention in april , specifically singling out sponsorship of the @entity27 by junk food and fizzy drink firms as sending out the wrong health message			2
the @entity34 has also recently passed a motion calling for a ban on the sponsorship of the @entity27 ( and other sporting events ) by such companies			2
even the @entity40 , though not sharing that policy prescription , agrees @entity41 are not necessarily compatible with @entity19 values and in an editorial backs changes to the way sponsors are selected and expected to behave			1
the media has , until now , been slow to pick up what health campaigners have understood for some time : there is public unease at some of the world 's biggest junk food manufacturers using the @entity19 to heavily promote their unhealthy products at every opportunity , and especially to children			1
in fact , one might expect sentiment against the company to fall further , now the torch relay -- with its super-sized @entity17 trucks and brightly dressed assistants handing out free @entity17 samples and merchandise to children and their parents -- has passed through @entity70 's streets			1
parents ' worries about advertising and sponsorship undermining their efforts to encourage their children to eat healthily are supported by academic research			0
a systematic review commissioned by the @entity79 and more recent studies have concluded that junk food promotions to children influences their food preferences , purchasing behavior and consumption , increasing their risk of serious illness in childhood and later life			0
the situation is made worse by the nature of the @entity19 sponsorship deals , which dictate the @entity27 ' experience for children far beyond the @entity95			1
the exclusive rights that @entity16 's , @entity17 and @entity99 's have for branded food and soft drink products at the @entity27 blocks brands and manufacturers which might offer healthier alternatives			1
meanwhile , licensing agreements restrict the promotional use of the @entity19 mascots @entity106 and @entity106 -- and thus access to their five - 15 - year - old target audience -- to these same official sponsors			2
hence all the food tie - ins with the @entity19 mascots are for chocolate and sweets			2
the sponsors try to sugar - coat their @entity19 involvement with ever - grander sports and exercise schemes that they claim will make children more active			1
however , there is little evidence that these short - term pushes will have a lasting effect in increasing children 's physical activity levels			0
moreover , the companies can not disguise one salient fact : no amount of free equipment and sporting initiatives will make unhealthy diets any less unhealthy			1
this is what makes @entity16 's , @entity17 and @entity99 's such unsuitable @entity19 sponsors			1
the @entity27 are hugely valuable to the sponsors , which is why the merest sniff of unease from the @entity4 president is likely to provoke a fierce response , as they seek to protect their privileged position			1
the relationship should not be so imbalanced -- given that the @entity4 derives four times as much income from broadcasting rights as it does from sponsorship deals , it remains curiously reluctant to demand more from its global sponsors			1
now is the time for the @entity4 to re-evaluate its policies and its highly - prized sponsorship deals			1
we must ensure that continued pressure from civil society will be felt by @entity10 and his colleagues and give them the courage to make it happen			0
four years ' time may be too late -- not only for the waistlines and health of citizens in 2014 and 2016 @entity19 hosts @entity161 and @entity162 , but also those in the emerging markets of @entity165 and @entity166 where @entity17 and @entity16 's are already ruthlessly exploiting opportunities to promote their products			1
@entity1 invited the sponsors named to respond to @entity171 's argument : @entity17 : " as one of the longest , continuous sponsors of the @entity4 , we are proud that we are able to use our sponsorship to enable millions of people to experience the @entity27 and believe we have a valid role to play			1
as well as sharing expertise , without the support of sponsors such as @entity17 , many @entity177 would be unable to send athletes to compete			2
" people consume many different foods and beverages , so no one single food or beverage alone is responsible for people being overweight or obese			0
we believe all of our drinks can be enjoyed as part of an active , healthy lifestyle that includes a sensible , balanced diet and regular physical activity			0
" we are also helping people be physically active and our three - year partnership with @entity193 will connect 110,000 young people with sport and create a new generation of coaches			0
@entity17 sponsors more than 250 physical activity and nutrition education programs in more than 100 countries and we are committed to sponsoring a program in every country that we operate by the end of 2015			2
" @entity16 , ceo , @entity16 's @entity70 : " as a popular restaurant with millions of families here in @entity70 , i know that parents care most about the quality of the food that we serve			1
they also expect us to behave responsibly in all that we do			0
day in and day out we take those responsibilities seriously			0
" here in the @entity70 we offer broad choice on our menu and clear , easy to understand information to help parents make the choices that are right for them and their children			0
we also have a long - term commitment to reducing fat , salt and sugar across our menu that has seen us cut the salt content of an average @entity222 by 46 % over the last 10 years and the sugar content by 31 %			0
" in our marketing we go beyond this country 's stringent regulatory requirements by finding fun ways to promote fruit and vegetables to children alongside organic milk or non-carbonated drinks			0
we also support hundreds of grassroots sports and volunteering programs across the @entity70 through our long - term association with football and the @entity19			0
we are proud of our involvement with @entity238 and the responsible role we are playing in helping to make it an enjoyable games and a great success			0
" @entity99 's declined to comment			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			0
