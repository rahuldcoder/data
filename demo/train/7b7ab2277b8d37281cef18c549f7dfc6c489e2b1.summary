" gush all you want about @entity15 , @entity16 and other recent tech innovations			0
i 'd stack @entity3 and his tv remote against all of them , " wrote @entity18 at @entity19			1
" after all , which would you be more willing to give up -- @entity15 or your remote ? ... thought so			2
" @entity3 , who died of " natural causes , " according to a news release , invented @entity27 's " @entity31 " wireless remote control , which was introduced in 1955 and was heralded as the first of its kind			1
" it used a flashlight - like device to activate photocells on the television set to change channels , " the @entity27 news release says			1
in the 1950s , the mechanics of using a remote were a little clunky : " the viewer used a highly directional flashlight to activate the four control functions , which turned the picture and sound on and off and changed channels by turning the tuner dial clockwise and counterclockwise , " @entity27 says			1
@entity45 from @entity46 writes that eccentricities always have been part of the remote control and its odd history : " because the remote shined visible light , @entity51 could be confused by other light sources			0
in spite of its quirkiness , the @entity31 was a revolution , and the reason @entity3 was bestowed with humorous titles ranging from ' the founding father of the couch potato ' to ' the czar of zapping ' to ' the beach boy of channel surfing			1
' " and an advertisement from that era underscores just how new this invention was			0
" a flash of magic light from across the room ( no wires , no cords ) turns set on , off or changes channels , " one ad says , " and you remain in your easy chair ! " born in @entity77 , @entity3 had a long career as an engineer at @entity27 , where he worked his way up from the stockroom			1
his inventions , mostly in the field of television , earned 18 @entity86 patents			0
technology analysts , commentators and remote users are using the occasion of @entity3 's death to celebrate his invention and tease a bit about its legacy			2
" thanks for the belly @entity101 , " someone wrote on the tech blog @entity97 's facebook page			0
" others chose to focus on the way @entity3 , who won a @entity105 from the @entity106 for his creation , changed the world with the invention			2
the tv remote was the precursor to interactive entertainment -- and it 's part of the reason we 're able to navigate digital content so freely , says the @entity117 's @entity116			1
" the new device meant people could change channels quickly and easily from the comfort of their sectionals , and that affordance meant that television stations could not continue to sell advertising or deliver programming the way that they had before when it was more difficult to change the channel , " he writes			2
" i do not think it is an accident that we started channel surfing ( 1986 ) before we started surfing the @entity131			0
" as if taking a cue from that thought , one @entity16 user wrote : " @entity135 , inventor of the tv remote control			1
please honor the man by reading this tweet for at least 5 seconds before scrolling			0
" @entity97 also muses on the post-remote world : " cordless control allowed audiences a vastly new experience of consuming television : for the first time ever , they could switch programs without getting up to turn the dial			0
no longer were programs endured simply because they were too lazy to get up off the couch			0
commercials could be avoided by switching channels , or muted , with just the press of a button			0
' channel surfing ' become a thing			0
