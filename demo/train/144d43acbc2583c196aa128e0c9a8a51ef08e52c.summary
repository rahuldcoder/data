-- @entity1 is testing a major profile redesign that 's very reminiscent of @entity3 and @entity4			1
@entity6 assistant features editor @entity7 spotted on tuesday a huge update to his @entity1 profile page , with the main picture and bio scaled to the left and significantly more real estate dedicated to the header photo			1
the revamped tweet stream is also a departure from its signature look			0
there is a greater focus on photos and content cards			0
it moves away from a strictly vertical timeline too			0

it 's common for @entity1 to quietly test new features and design updates before tweaking or rolling it out to a larger user base			1
experiments typically go out to a small , random pool of users			2
under the header photo in the test is the count for tweets , photos / videos ( a new category called out on the profile ) , who you are following , followers , favorites and lists			1
although @entity7 is n't verified on the site , there 's an option for the stream to show " tweets " and " tweets and replies " for every user â € ” a feature typically reserved for those with the blue check mark			2
other profile pages viewed from an account with the new design are automatically made to look like this too			1
this means that even if your @entity1 page is n't a part of the test , @entity7 can see what yours will look like			2
see also : everything you need to know about @entity68 in 2 minutes the recommended header photo size in the test version is 1500 x 500 pixels , up from 1252 x 626 in the current design , so users with the new design will want to switch their picture so it does n't look stretched			1
the news comes days after @entity1 rolled out its latest design to all users , after weeks of behind the scenes testing			2
