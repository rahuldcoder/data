" they must not remain on the sidelines and be safe , " @entity12 said			0
" those who issue statements and invite people to create chaos in the streets and attack one another must be dealt with according to @entity1 laws			0
" in sunday 's protests , at least seven demonstrators were killed in clashes with security forces , although the @entity4 government has denied that its security forces killed anyone			1
still , a video released tuesday appeared to show green and white @entity4 police vehicles driving into crowds of protesters and running over at least one			1
other videos purported to show people said to have been killed by the police vehicles			0
@entity4 authorities reported that most of the seven dead had died after being struck with " hard objects or due to similar causes , " according to chief prosecutor @entity49			1
amateur video shot by demonstrators showed clashes , and a number of protesters with serious and possibly fatal injuries , including some with apparent gunshot wounds			0
but the battles -- depicted in sometimes grainy and shaky amateur videos anonymously posted on the @entity59 -- have drawn harsh criticisms from the international community , and subsequently harsh criticisms from the @entity4 government			1
state media sourced an official as saying that about 500 people had been arrested in conjunction with the clashes			0
the protests fell on @entity68 , a holy day for @entity70 commemorating the martyrdom of @entity72 , the grandson of the @entity73 who was killed in battle in @entity75 in 680 a.d. earlier wednesday , @entity1 reported that " two known plotters " of the violent post-election protests and sunday 's demonstrations had " escaped " from @entity10 and fled to the north of the country " to be safe from people 's anger			1

the crowd was a mix of men , women and children , as well as large religious processions accompanied by loud speakers denouncing sunday 's protests			1
" @entity18 said wednesday 's march showed that criticism by foreign nations can never have a negative impact on his country			2
" the officials of these countries should understand that their attempts will not affect the @entity4 nations ' equations , stances and idealistic and perfectionist move , " @entity18 told reporters at the end of a @entity173 meeting			2
he said the @entity181 and certain @entity100 countries were trying to foment unrest in @entity4 , and described those efforts as futile , @entity84 reported			2
@entity18 also advised president @entity185 and his @entity100 allies to learn from the experiences of their predecessors			0
" officials of the @entity181 and certain @entity100 states showed again that they have embarked on wrong plans , stances and attitude , " @entity18 said			0
the semi-official , state - run @entity195 also reported wednesday that foreign minister @entity196 had summoned @entity198 's ambassador to @entity10 , @entity199 , and notified him of @entity4 's protest over the " intervening stance of the @entity198 foreign minister			1

he accused the @entity4 government of " gross violations of international law			2
" " what we are witnessing in @entity18 's @entity4 is a toxic convergence of four distinct yet interrelated dangers : the danger of a nuclear @entity4 , the danger of state - sanctioned incitement to genocide , the danger of state sponsorship of international terrorism and the danger of a massive assault on human rights , " @entity303 said .			1
