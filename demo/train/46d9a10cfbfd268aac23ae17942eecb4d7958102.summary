-- about 15 years ago , when the @entity3 was first experimenting with wide - ranging sanctions against @entity2 , an @entity2 acquaintance remarked to me , " i certainly hope @entity2 does n't become another @entity6			1
" at that point , the @entity3 had imposed a total embargo on @entity6 for more than three decades			1
as he said it , i detected that part of him could not believe that a rich and cultured nation on the other side of the globe could ever be treated like an island dictatorship off the @entity3 coast			0
but i also saw a glint of apprehension in his eyes as he considered for the first time how @entity3 's vision of its own national interests could change when viewed through the prism of raw domestic politics			0
the cases are not at all the same			0
yet today , @entity6 has been under @entity3 embargo for 50 years , and @entity2 has passed the 16 - year mark			1
@entity6 experienced a @entity3 - sponsored invasion before the sanctions began			1
@entity2 is still waiting for its @entity33			1
when the @entity36 administration came into office , talk was all about " smart sanctions			2
" president @entity36 's foreign policy advisers had seen what indiscriminate sanctions had done to @entity42			1
ordinary lives were destroyed and , in the words of a friend whose family was in @entity42 , the entire middle class was criminalized , driven to smuggling and black - market dealings just to survive			1
the sanctions also created a sympathetic backlash with the @entity42 population and visceral anti-americanism throughout the world			1
we were not going to make that mistake again			0
instead , we would target sanctions only against the decision - makers and abusers			2
yet today , the sanctions regime in @entity2 is resembling , more and more , the @entity42 and @entity6 cases			1
we have arrived by a very different route			0
instead of controlling all goods going into the country , we have ingeniously found ways of manipulating @entity2 's banking system			1
that , together with regional boycotts , has the prospect of blocking a large proportion of @entity2 's oil sales			1
in @entity2 there has been a run on the currency , food prices are soaring , and every single person is beginning to experience some form of economic pain			1
that has been the source of considerable public satisfaction in @entity82 and elsewhere			0
it is also reminiscent of the early stages of the @entity42 experience			1
add to that the serial murders of civilian scientists , cybertampering with @entity2 's centrifuges , flyovers of @entity3 drones , and covert assistance to @entity2 separatist groups			1
what would we think if a nation were doing all of this to us ? the benign image of sanctions as graduated pressure has been transformed			2
in reality , it is war with @entity2 in all but name			1
until now , the threat of escalation has been a tool for promoting sanctions			2
i remember vividly my own experience in the @entity111 during the original @entity2 hostage crisis			1
at that time , president @entity113 and his @entity115 staff quite deliberately used the threat of a possible @entity3 military action against @entity2 to encourage @entity118 and other allies to adopt sanctions against @entity2			1
the purpose of the sanctions was to persuade @entity2 to release the @entity3 diplomatic hostages			1
the threat of military action was , however , very effective in getting allies to take economic actions that were contrary to their own national interests			0
the thinking was that economic sanctions and boycotts , however disagreeable , were less costly than the outbreak of a military conflict in the oil - rich @entity134			2
the same tactic was used by the @entity138 administration to twist the arms of reluctant allies			0
the presence of such uber - hawks as vice president @entity143 , @entity145 ambassador @entity144 and others , as well as the formal security doctrine of the administration to launch pre-emptive military attacks , gave the argument credibility			0
upon the arrival of the @entity36 administration and its initial policy of engagement with @entity2 , the role of enforcer shifted to @entity157			1
the first major media storm about an @entity157 attack on @entity2 came in the final months of the @entity138 administration , when @entity144 predicted without qualification in an interview with @entity163 that @entity157 would launch its attack before @entity138 left office , on the grounds that the incoming administration would be less sympathetic to the idea			1
since then , such predictions have become almost an annual event			0
@entity171 , writing in the @entity173 in september 2010 after extensive interviews with key @entity157 , concluded that " there is a better than 50 percent chance that @entity157 will launch a strike by next july , " 2011			0
that date came and went			0
then about a month ago , @entity157 commentator @entity179 wrote in the @entity180 that " after speaking with many senior @entity157 leaders and chiefs of the military and the intelligence , i have come to believe that @entity157 will indeed strike @entity2 in 2012			1
" it is a bit ironic that @entity179 spoke to the same individuals who had previously convinced @entity171 that a strike was coming in 2011			0
moreover , many of those interviewed openly expressed great doubt about the feasibility and wisdom of any such attack			0
this included the recently retired @entity197 chief @entity196 and the former @entity157 chief of staff @entity198 , who said that " the @entity2 threat was not as imminent " as some had suggested and that " a military strike would be catastrophic			2
" but the article resonated powerfully , especially in an election year			0
@entity205 has been extremely active in trying to prevent the administration from pursuing negotiations			0
@entity208 1905 -- the @entity209 of 2011 -- proposes to ban @entity3 diplomats from contact with " any @entity2 official who poses a threat to the @entity3			2
" there is scarcely anyone in @entity2 who has not chanted " @entity216 " ; does that constitute a threat and disqualify that person from contact with @entity3 diplomats ? more recently , a proposed sense of the @entity224 resolution tries to define the terms and acceptable objectives of any @entity3 policy dealing with @entity2 : â € ¢ it rejects " any policy that would rely on containment as an option in response to the @entity2 nuclear threat , " thus ruling out a policy that the @entity3 used successfully against the @entity230			2
â € ¢ it defines the @entity3 " red line , " where we would consider the use of force , not as @entity2 possession of a nuclear weapon , but rather as an @entity2 " nuclear weapons capability , " which by many calculations @entity2 already has			2
â € ¢ finally , it sets as the objective of any negotiations " the full and sustained suspension " of uranium enrichment by @entity2			2
but @entity2 regards enrichment for peaceful purposes as a right conferred by the @entity253 , and that principle is supported by a vast majority of the @entity2 population , including even the reformist opposition			1
this resolution is not binding , and it does not yet have majority support in the @entity224			0
however , it is apparently intended to be used as a centerpiece in the @entity263 @entity262 meeting that started this weekend in @entity82			0
and it comes just at the moment when it appears that negotiations between @entity266 and six major powers are likely to resume			0
there is an inevitability about sanctions imposed for political reasons			0
serious negotiations and compromise are precluded , and the appetite for ever - stronger sanctions grows with the realization that past efforts were a failure			0
if you set an impossible objective and then begin imposing sanctions to achieve it , the result is always more sanctions , until you arrive at the point where there are no more sanctions and only force remains			0
we are approaching that point			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity293 .			2

@entity293 : sanctions against @entity42 , @entity6 *harmed* the whole population , not just leaders
sick : sanctions against @entity2 causing anti-americanism and ruining ordinary lives
16 years of @entity2 sanctions changed nothing , he says , amount to war in all but name
sick : when sanctions get harsher and harsher and do nothing , war becomes inevitable
