-- redemption is within grasp -- and for @entity3 the opportunity to exorcise the demons of yesteryear is in sight			1
tuesday 's crushing victory over a @entity10 side which has dominated @entity12 's top competition for much of the past few years was yet another sign of the growing power of this @entity16 giant			1
last year 's defeat by @entity18 at its home stadium still hurts , as does the memory of losing out to @entity21 two years ago , but that pain and anguish has driven @entity3 to the brink of history			2
not since 2001 has @entity3 won @entity12 's elite competition , but surely this is the greatest chance they will ever have to end that drought after brushing aside a @entity10 team which has won this competition three times in the past seven years			1
the @entity34 league title has already been wrapped up , while the domestic cup looks set to follow given the team 's astonishing run of form			0
that form was underlined with a display full of pace , power and vigor which blew @entity10 away with ease			2
on the day it announced the signing of @entity47 's star playmaker @entity46 in a deal worth an estimated $ 48 million , @entity3 showed they have quality in abundance			2
@entity52 scored twice and further strikes from @entity54 and the outstanding @entity55 dismantled a @entity10 side currently 13 points clear at the top of @entity59			1
" of course , we 're all very happy about the win , especially the size of the margin , " @entity3 manager @entity60 told reporters			2
" we were first class , " he said			0
" but we know we still have 90 minutes ahead of us in @entity67			0
" we want to enjoy tonight , but nothing more			0
" @entity60 had bristled at suggestions he should seek advice from his successor in waiting , @entity72 , for ideas of how to defeat the @entity75 giant			0
@entity72 , who will replace @entity60 at the end of the season , enjoyed huge success at @entity79 , winning two @entity81 titles and three league crowns before he departed in april 2012			2
but it is @entity72 who may be asking for advice after watching @entity3 ruthlessly destroy the team which he had built with such love and devotion			2
@entity3 , fresh from hammering @entity90 6 - 1 in the @entity91 at the weekend , made a rapid start and should have forged ahead within the first three minutes			1
@entity55 exchanged passes with @entity67 midfielder @entity94 before stealing in behind the @entity10 defense , but he could only fire his effort straight at @entity97			1
the @entity75 side , playing in its sixth successive semifinal , appeared rattled by @entity3 's approach and was fortunate not concede a penalty when @entity103 clearly handled @entity105 's strike inside the penalty area			1
but any sense of injustice soon disappeared as @entity3 took a deserved lead with 25 minutes on the clock			0
@entity55 was the architect , picking out @entity111 at the far post with looping cross to head the ball towards goal and allow @entity52 to nod the ball home			1
not since october 2008 had @entity10 won a @entity81 match away from home when trailing at halftime and they never liked look repeating the feat here			1
@entity10 's talisman @entity123 , clearly struggling with injury , rarely looked like troubling the @entity3 defenders , while @entity10 struggled to deal with the @entity34 side 's superior ability at set pieces			1
and it was no surprise that within four minutes of the restart @entity3 had extended its lead to assume complete control of the tie			0
once again it was the home side 's aerial prowess which caused @entity10 problems as @entity52 headed the ball across goal for @entity54 to volley home			1
replays showed @entity54 to have been in an offside position and while the visiting side may have had every right to feel aggrieved , it was nothing to what was to transpire with 17 minutes remaining			2
@entity55 , a constant menace all night , was the man at the heart of the action , racing towards goal as @entity10 began to back off			1
the @entity152 winger looked to have beaten @entity153 , but his case was quite clearly helped by @entity52 bundling the defender to the ground			0
while the visiting team stopped in anticipation of the referee 's whistle , @entity55 continued his run and lashed the ball into the far corner before turning away to celebrate			2
quite how the foul was missed by the referee and the extra officials behind the goal is extraordinary , but that scarcely mattered to a rampant @entity3			0
@entity52 almost added a fourth when he raced clear only to be denied by a fine block by @entity97 as @entity10 began to crumble			1
@entity3 's surpremacy was emphasized further two minutes later when @entity171 rampaged down the left and picked out @entity52 to flick the ball home			1
" i think we knew we were able to give them good competition , " @entity55 told @entity175 following his side 's impressive showing			1
" i think everybody said before it was a 50 - 50 game			0
" we can be very proud , this team ( @entity10 ) has dominated @entity12 over the last five years and if you beat them like this in such terrific way i think you can be proud			0
" but on the other hand , let 's be quiet , enjoy this evening but not anymore , because there 's still the second game to play and we have to be ready			0
" @entity10 now faces an " almost impossible " task to make the final and defender @entity103 admits his team was completely outplayed			1
he told television channel @entity193 : " there 's not much you can say , they 've been faster , stronger and played the better football			0
" we must n't talk about the referee ; i do n't think he had any influence			0
" it 's almost impossible for us			0
they 've been better than us , we need to congratulate them and show our best in the return leg , while thinking about finishing the league as soon as possible			0
we must go out at the @entity79 to win the game for our fans			0

@entity3 crushed @entity10 4 - 0 in the first leg of its @entity81 semifinal
@entity52 scored twice with @entity54 and @entity55 also on target
@entity3 boss warns against *complacency* ahead of second leg
@entity10 's @entity103 believes " almost impossible " for his side to *progress*
