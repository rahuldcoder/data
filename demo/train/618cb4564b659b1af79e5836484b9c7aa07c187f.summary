-- web - page addresses can be notoriously long , but even the normal ones seem absolutely huge in our age of @entity5 and text messaging			0
every letter counts when you have only 140 characters			0
now @entity10 hopes to revolutionize the web address shortening arena with @entity12 , now available to the public through its website at @entity15			1
@entity12 was originally a proprietary way for @entity10 to abbreviate its web addresses within services such as @entity19 ( for saving article links ) or @entity21 ( for sending a location )			1
the new @entity12 website will abbreviate your links and store them for you to view later or share with others			1
@entity10 says it is also using special provisions to prevent blind links from leading to malware or dangerous websites			1
but @entity10 is entering a super-crowded arena			2
@entity32 has been abbreviating web addresses for nearly a decade , and the advent of @entity5 has encouraged more sophisticated abbreviators , like bit.ly , which allow people to organize and search through their saved links			2
individual media sites have also created their own abbreviations : http://nyti.ms for the @entity41 , for example , and http://t.co for @entity5			0
as @entity46 notes , the biggest advantage @entity10 has over the smaller abbreviators is its massive size and the connection between dozens of its services			0
that may be enough to make it the top web shortener in short order .			0
