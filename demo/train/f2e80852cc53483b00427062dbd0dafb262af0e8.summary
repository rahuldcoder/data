-- it 's a @entity2 photograph taken over 40 years ago			1
shot on film , and after the game , but it still ranks as one of the most memorable and impactful of football images			1
at the 1970 tournament , legendary @entity9 player @entity8 and @entity12 's @entity11 - winning captain @entity10 share an open embrace and dazzling , relaxed smiles after the heat of battle against each other on the pitch			1
" it 's a wonderful moment			1
two legends , that natural expression , friendship and admiration			1
there 's a real power to that photography , " says @entity25 's director of photography @entity26			1
photographer @entity31 captured that moment while many others around him were changing film or were unaware it was unfolding			2
" this is a great example of a picture that most of us could take these days if we 're keeping our eyes open			0
you can get moments like these			0
and they really resonate , " @entity26 tells @entity0 's sports photography masterclass series			1
" there 's no reason not to take a lot of pictures nowadays			1
you can delete them afterwards , " he adds			0
" keep your mind open to imagery because it can come from the most surprising of places			0
" fast forward almost three decades later , to another iconic image that also stands the test of time -- but portrays peak action instead of the quiet power of an off - the - field interaction			2
it was the @entity63 final in @entity64			1
@entity66 's goalkeeper @entity65 dramatically foiled @entity9 's superstar striker @entity67 as the home side pulled off a shock 3 - 0 victory			1
" it 's a remarkable peak action photograph and it works as well because there was a whole backstory with @entity67 that day , " @entity26 explains			1
@entity67 , the @entity2 's all - time leading scorer , was the best player of the tournament			1
however , there was a controversy that day when he was initially not named in the starting lineup			0
rumors spread that he had a pre-match seizure			0
despite this , @entity67 did take the field for a @entity9 side heavily favored to win			1
" they ended up losing and @entity67 had a pretty bad game on top of that			1
so there 's a metaphor here for what a bad day @entity67 had , " says @entity26			1
" typically you go into these @entity93 and you assume it 's a straight - up sports event			1
but then something else happens -- this added drama that soccer sends			0
" @entity98 : send us your best football photos while there is a lot at stake for players on such big occasions , the photographers are also out to make a name for themselves			2
in this case , the snapper was @entity110 -- well known for his work with @entity112			0
the magazine 's layout is probably the reason this particular shot of @entity67 and @entity65 was shot as a vertical , says @entity26			1
" photography tends to be horizontal and certainly in this day and age where we 're looking at pictures on a screen , on our phone , on our @entity125 , horizontal is typically the way to go , " he explains			1
" now @entity110 was shooting this for @entity112 so i 'm sure in the back of his mind was to get the cover , which is one of the rare places that you can actually have a really good use for a vertical picture			0
" and i believe this was going to be the cover until it got overtaken by a picture of ( american football legend ) @entity140 smoking a cigar , for whatever reason			2
" the equipment @entity110 used then seems ancient compared to today 's technology , which @entity26 calls " truly staggering			2
" " as a photo editor , we used to pick up the phone and ask photographers , ' did you get it ? ' now the question is , ' where is it ? ' " he says			2
even in the four years since the last @entity2 in @entity156 , the speed at which photography moves from field to office is much faster			2
" quite literally we can be seeing pictures within the minute , " @entity26 says			0
" photographers are shooting on the sidelines			0
those images instantaneously go to their picture editors , be it in @entity163 or @entity164			0
they are editing and they are being sent to us			0
" and what about in the next four years , when the @entity2 is played in @entity169 ? how will photography have changed ? " right now the way we take still photos is we press the button to start the camera			2
i 've got a feeling you 're going to get to a place where you press the button to turn the camera off , " @entity26 predicts			0
he says the process will entail looking at a game afterwards to pick out the best angle and most important moment			0
but despite the technical wizardry of our age , @entity26 says the talent of an experienced photographer will always have cache			2
" technology has made the job easier			0
but the analogy i 'd give is that cameras these days are like @entity196 racing cars			0
but the real difference is who 's driving the car			2
if i try to drive one of those cars , i 'm not going to win a race			0
you give it to a professional driver -- they 'll win races			0
