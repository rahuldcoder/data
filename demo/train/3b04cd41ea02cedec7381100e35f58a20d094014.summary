-- it began with the self - immolation of an unemployed college graduate in @entity4			1
now , newfound people power in the @entity6 and @entity7 is spreading fast			1
bolstered by the toppling of @entity10 in @entity11 , popular uprising has now taken root in a part of the world where it has not been a part of the trajectory of change			1
on tuesday , the birthday of the @entity23 , parts of the @entity21 world were on fire , the people clamoring for change			1
fierce demonstrations erupted in @entity28 , where people have organized themselves through social media websites such as @entity31 and @entity32 , the same forums used by their @entity11 and @entity4 counterparts			1
human rights activists said @entity28 initially demanded reform , but some are now calling for the removal of the royal family			1
in @entity41 , pro- and anti-government protesters clashed for a fifth day in the capital city of @entity43			1
" this is against the @entity41 constitution , and people have the right to peacefully protest , " said human rights activist @entity44			1
and , as @entity53 's @entity52 slowly emptied , @entity51 's @entity50 swelled with people			1
both names mean freedom and despite a security crackdown , tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in the @entity60 capital monday			1
@entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 have also been a part of the domino effect			0
" we really are facing a tsunami in @entity73 politics , " said @entity66 , senior fellow for foreign policy at @entity69 ' @entity68			0
" i do n't think there is any country -- except the very small and very rich and oil - rich countries like @entity79 and @entity80 -- that is immune , " @entity74 said			0
" all of these countries have the potential for unrest in a way they 've never had it before			0
" if only @entity88 , the 26 - year - old unemployed man who was beaten by police and then set himself on fire , had lived to see what he began			0
but @entity88 died in january , a catalyst for the events that unfolded rapidly after his death			0
@entity4 dictator @entity97 @entity96 fell on january 14 and fled the country			1
just days later , @entity11 began massing at @entity52			1
after 18 short days , @entity10 was gone , as abruptly as he had risen to power three decades ago			0
" the yearning for change has been there for at least a decade , if not more , but it took the events in @entity4 and now @entity11 to break the barrier of fear that people had , " @entity74 said			1
" fear that the army would shoot them , fear that the army would crack down on them			0
what it did was it broke that barrier of fear			0
" the region -- where people are divided between fabulously wealthy " haves " and desperately poor " have - nots , " a region split between those who can and those who can not participate in government -- sits like a tinderbox , ready to explode			1
" there 's a common thread there , " said @entity123 , senior fellow at the @entity124			2
" yes , they do want freedom in the sense of not national independence -- they have that -- but freedom from oppressive internal security , authoritarian political controls and the freedom to participate in a more democratic government , " he said			0
there are also economic concerns			0
" people are very upset , and in many cases i think with good reason , about poverty and unemployment , " @entity123 said			2
@entity146 , a @entity6 expert at the @entity147 , said the divide between the " cans " and the " cannots " is , in some ways , more dangerous than the gap between rich and poor			0
these are no peasant revolts , @entity146 said			0
the people on the streets include huge numbers of under - and unemployed people , " sometimes affluent individuals who feel humiliated and powerless			2
" " that 's one of the driving psychological factors that powered @entity11 's uprising , " @entity146 said			1
there is also a vast generational gap that some governments may not be able to bridge , said @entity165 , managing director for national security at the @entity167			2
" most of these entrenched regimes throughout the region are governed by an old elite establishment that has grown more and more out of touch with the younger generations of its population , " @entity165 said			2
" consequently , we 're seeing -- perhaps sparked by what transpired in @entity11 and @entity4 -- a stronger push among those younger generations for greater influence and a larger political voice in their country			1
" the potential for uprisings exists in those places where all the gaps are widest , though it 's impossible to predict whether other dictators or entrenched regimes will fall as they did in @entity4 and @entity11			1
beyond the overarching commonalities , each nation faces specific challenges			0
@entity41 must deal with regional and tribal rivalries			1
@entity28 faces simmering tension between @entity196 , who form the ruling class , and @entity198 , who form a slight majority			1
@entity123 said @entity200 , too , could possibly see unrest , but probably on a small scale			0
and in @entity63 , " people are just too scared , too intimidated " by @entity205 's iron hand			1
@entity61 , he said , also bears watching because it shares many of @entity11 's underlying issues of high numbers of young people , unemployment , corruption and a leadership that has been in power for a while			1
other countries , like @entity216 , have been " surprisingly quiet , " @entity123 said			0
in @entity216 , the king has only been around for a decade , and @entity123 said perhaps people are still willing to give him a chance			2
there have also been some " safety valves , " such as a parliament			0
the @entity223 , @entity123 said , is a wealthy nation that can afford to take care of its citizens , if necessary , in pretty lavish style			0
and about 75 % of the people are guest workers from other nations " who do n't have any rights at all , " @entity123 said			2
and then there is @entity60			1
it 's no stranger to mass demonstrations -- the @entity21 regime itself came to power through revolution			2
but the regime has already shown the world that it will not hesitate to suppress street demonstrations and the opposition there has not yet been able to coalesce around common goals , said @entity244 , a fellow at the @entity245			0
the other problem in @entity60 , @entity244 said , is that the international media have been banned from covering the demonstrations			1
the world can not see what is happening in @entity50 as they did in @entity52			0
but @entity123 predicted protests will continue in @entity60			1
" we saw yesterday that despite the most severe kind of internal repression , you had thousands of demonstrators out on the streets , and that 's the tip of the iceberg , " @entity123 said			2
" i think this probably foreshadows a long period of cat - and - mouse games continuing between the opposition and the regime at kind of a simmer			0
" @entity123 did not see another government 's ouster on the horizon			2
" but it 's important to note that after @entity4 it took a while , it took a few weeks for the protests to really start gathering steam in @entity11 , " he said			1
" right now , we 're just a few days after @entity10 was finally tossed out in @entity11			1
it 's too soon to be very confident about where this might go next			2
" it 's hard to say what will happen next , but almost every observer agrees that this part of the world will never be the same			1
@entity146 , of the @entity147 , quoted @entity284 in the " @entity285 " to put events in perspective			0
" we 're not in @entity288 anymore , " he said			0
the @entity289 and its allies , he added , need to understand that			0
" this is a transformative event in @entity6 politics , " @entity146 said			0
enough , perhaps , to change dark perceptions of a region mired in extremism and bloodshed			2
two powerful messages are echoing through the region , he said			2
to @entity300 , the protesters have said : @entity301 does not have to occur through an adherence to radical ideology or violence			0
and to autocrats and dictators : " you better start looking in the mirror and making changes or you 're going to be looking in the rear view mirror , " @entity146 said			2
those " footsteps " you hear are " coming for you			0
" @entity0 's @entity312 , @entity313 and @entity314 contributed to this report .			0

protests erupted in @entity60 , @entity41 and @entity28 this week
the ousters of dictators in @entity4 and @entity11 have *inspired* people , say **analysts**
it 's hard to predict if other governments will fall
but the region will never be the same , **analysts** agree
