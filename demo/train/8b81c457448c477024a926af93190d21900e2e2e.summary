-- believe it or not , more people in the world have a cellphone than access to a toilet			1
that 's according to @entity8 , a charity co-founded by actor @entity9			1
" i was just shocked by this because i could n't even relate to it , " says the @entity11 winner			0
" as an @entity15 -- like , water ? there 's the kitchen sink , the bathroom sink -- you know -- there 's water			2
" " every 20 seconds a little kid , a child dies because they lack access to clean water and sanitation			1
" @entity9 , father of four daughters , says , " once you have kids it 's impossible not to see their face in every child you see			2
" what was truly horrifying for @entity9 and @entity8 's co-founder , @entity36 , was how preventable water - related deaths can be			1
" we 've solved this in the @entity42 for 100 years , " he says referring to the worldwide water and sanitation crisis			2
" you know , imagine if we cure cancer tomorrow and in 100 years , three - and - a - half million people a year are still dying of it			1
i mean it 's just unconscionable			0
" so , @entity9 decided to use his fame to help			2
" if cameras were going to follow us around , why not make something good out of that ? " in 2006 , @entity9 co-founded @entity53 , which served to bring attention to clean water initiatives in @entity56			1
two years later , he met @entity36 of @entity57 at the @entity58			2
the two decided to combine efforts by merging charities and co-founded @entity8 in 2009			1
" we complement each other and @entity9 certainly has come a long way in water , not much for me in acting , " @entity36 jokes			1
the nonprofit provides affordable access to safe water and proper lavatory facilities through microfinance loans			1
the loan program gives people the financial means to access their local municipalities or fund their own projects			1
without the loans , they are forced to turn to the water mafia , who , according to @entity9 , dramatically mark up the cost of water			1
the other option is to fund their own projects through loan sharks , but that money comes with high interest			2
in @entity88 , @entity36 and @entity9 came face to face with a person who exemplifies how successful @entity8 's loan program is			1
" we met a woman who was paying 40 rupees every day for her family to go use the public toilet			0
they had to go pay a fee and they had to go purchase the water that they needed , " @entity36 says			1
" she was able to get a @entity104 loan , that allowed her to pay her connection fee , that allowed her to connect to the utility and have a faucet in her home and allowed her to build a toilet in her home and her loan payment was 40 rupees a month			0
once she gets that paid off over two years , that 's another 40 rupees in her pocket			0
she 'll pay a small bill for her water bill each month , but she 'll come out way ahead			0
" @entity9 says he was moved by " the sense of dignity that these women have when you talk to them and they 've paid their loans off and maybe taking out a second loan for a toilet , the sense of empowerment you know , the sense that their life has been altered in this way , that they are now in control of their destiny			1
" this empowerment translates directly into social and economic growth for the community			0
according to @entity36 , 200 million hours are spent daily by women walking to collect water and 443 million school days are lost every year from children having to scout for water			1
" once you get this foundational piece in -- safe water that 's close to the home or a tap at somebody 's house -- then the whole family can start to take off and become much more economically self - sufficient			0
they can grow more food , they can spend time in a working job and kids can be in school			0
we all know that that 's the thing that 's really going to liberate people from poverty is an education			0
water allows all of that to start happening , " @entity36 says			1
@entity9 witnessed that firsthand in @entity165 where he met a 13 - year - old girl while attending the celebration of a new water pump			2
the girl had previously spent around three hours a day collecting water			0
" i said , ' three hours a day ! what are you going to do now that you have all this time ? your homework ? ' " " and she looked at me and she goes , ' shh ! i do n't need more time to do my homework			0
i 'm the smartest in my class			0
' " @entity9 prodded her some more , asking , " ' but you have these extra three hours			2
what are you going to do ? ' and she looked me right in the eyes and she goes ' i 'm going to play			0
' " " it was wonderful to know that this little girl was going to have time to play like every 13 - year - old girl should have			0
" " but you think about the hundreds of millions of kids for whom that 's not an option -- and not only do they not have those three hours , they may not even be in school because they 're scavenging for water			0
and so it 's not just a life or death issue , it 's a quality of life issue			0
