-- " @entity5 , " a squeaky - clean pop - gospel fairy tale featuring @entity2 and @entity3 in canned catfights , reflects the inspiration of " @entity7 " and @entity8 , in that order			2
the " @entity7 " side , at least in my book , does n't exactly amount to a recommendation , but it does mean that the movie 's musical numbers are catchy and rollicking and , in their bright sunshiny way , rather soulful			1
in the small town of @entity19 , @entity20 , times are hard -- every other storefront is empty -- but the @entity23 choir has lifted local spirits by rising to become a semifinalist in the @entity26			1
can these spunky vocalists go the distance ? not until they learn to work together in harmony			0
which means that @entity31 ( @entity3 ) , the choir 's new director , has to stop feuding with @entity34 ( @entity2 ) , widow of the former choir leader , over the direction of the group 's music			2
@entity39 , feisty and smart - mouthed , favors tradition , while @entity34 , whose grandson @entity41 ( @entity42 ) is the new songbird on the block , is out to shake things up			2
@entity2 now looks like a " @entity51 " puppet ( the film makes plastic - surgery jokes about her so that we do n't have to ) , but she still has a way with lines like '' i 'd call you stubborn , but that 'd be an insult to mules ! '' " @entity5 " also finds room for a teenager with @entity60 's syndrome ( @entity61 ) who loves one - hit - wonder songs ( but can he learn to love himself ? ) , as well as a romance between @entity41 and @entity39 's daughter @entity64 ( @entity65 )			1
these two are pretty -- and as bland as balsa wood			0
but each time the innocuousness starts to get to you , you 're woken up by @entity41 and @entity64 's swooning '' maybe i 'm amazed '' duet , or a kid - choir rendition of @entity74 's '' that 's the way @entity8 planned it , '' or the final '' @entity77 '' blowout			1
these numbers create a deep river of feeling , even when stuck in the shallow banks of a movie like this one			0
