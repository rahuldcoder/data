-- the stars of tennis took time out from their @entity4 preparations sunday to honor the man who helped them become some of the highest - paid athletes in the world			1
@entity8 passed away friday , aged 54 , succumbing to the motor neurone disease that had forced him to step down as head of the men 's @entity11 @entity11			1
@entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 led a minute 's silence ahead of the start of the @entity20 , while similar tributes were held at tournaments in @entity23 and @entity24			1
" @entity8 was n't just the president of the @entity11 but was a player himself , a board member , " @entity14 said on the @entity11 website			1
" he 's given so much time and effort to the @entity11 , and i think this is really what we will try to honor in a small way today			1
" @entity8 reached a career - high 34 in the world rankings , but his efforts in administration had far bigger impact on the game , from his time on the players ' council to running the @entity11 's @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 operations before becoming president in early 2012			1
the @entity48 took the end - of - season championship to @entity50 as part of tennis ' global spread in the early 2000s , and then brought it to @entity54 where it has become a lucrative moneyspinner and showpiece for the @entity11			1
he has also been credited with getting the players a larger share of prize money from the four grand slam tournaments since he took over the top role a year and half ago			0
" he was always very nice to work with			0
gentle , " said 17 - time grand slam winner @entity14			2
" i 've really enjoyed every step of the way working with him			0
for me , it was hard seeing him not be the same anymore towards the end physically			0
but we can only appreciate what he 's done for us and what he did until the last moment he really possibly could			2
" that will never go away			0
i 'm sure that the @entity11 and the players will come up with something for the legacy of @entity8			1
" @entity15 said @entity8 was " a very loved person " on the circuit			1
" the only thing we can do is say thank you for everything he has done for our sport , all the support , and all the good things he has done these years to help us and to help us to have a better sport			0
it 's a sad moment for all of us			2
" world no. 2 @entity14 is returning to action this week to defend his @entity20 title , having recovered from the back injury that hampered him at @entity94 in march			1
like @entity15 , he is happy that the @entity96 event has reverted to traditional red clay after experimenting with a blue surface last year that was roundly condemned by many players and subsequently banned by the @entity11			1
" there was a lot of criticism about the color , about the quality of the court as well , being extremely slippery , " he told reporters			0
" i do n't know if that was due to the color , but this tournament has in the past had issues with the quality of the court			0
i think through what happened last year with the controversy around the blue clay , it was a big eye opener to have a proper court here now			0
" i think this year , from what i 'm hearing from the players , it 's a good quality court and the players are happy			2
in the process , hopefully we 'll see better tennis this year			0
" top - ranked @entity13 , who ended @entity15 's eight - year reign in @entity130 last month , is also happier with the new surface			1
" the court is great			0
the one where i practiced is great			0
i have n't practiced on the center court yet , but i 'll try to do that tonight to get a little feel about it , " the @entity135 said			0
@entity15 bounced back from his @entity130 final defeat to win the @entity142 title for the eighth time in nine years			1
" the courts were not at the level to play professionally last year , " he told reporters			0
" fortunately this year they are very good			0
in @entity20 , we have the problem of the dry climate , so it 's very difficult to have the clay that settles down properly			1
" the women 's tournament is also packed with top names , as defending champion @entity17 seeks to protect her no. 1 ranking from the challenge of in - form @entity159 -- who will go top if she wins the title			1
@entity17 made a slow start to her opening match against @entity166 qualifier @entity164 on sunday before winning 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 6 - 1			1
however , her older sister @entity167 was forced to withdraw ahead of her match against @entity96 's @entity169 due to a back injury			2
@entity50 fifth seed @entity171 crashed out , losing 6 - 3 6 - 2 to 18 - year - old @entity174 @entity173			0
former world no. 1 @entity175 continued her decline , as the @entity178 10th seed lost 6 - 2 6 - 4 to another @entity166 player , @entity179			0
@entity182 eighth seed @entity180 , the 2011 @entity20 champion , went through to round two along with @entity185 's world no. 4 @entity183			1
meanwhile , veteran @entity186 won the @entity187 on sunday , beating fellow @entity24 @entity188 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) 13 years after losing in his previous final appearance in the clay event			2
the 35 - year - old , a former world no. 2 , will now climb to 13th in the rankings			0
it was the first all - @entity24 final in @entity195 since 1965 , and @entity188 was unable to defend his title -- having also won it in 2007			2
in @entity198 , @entity197 upset top seed and world no. 4 @entity201 6 - 1 6 - 4 to win the @entity202 on sunday			2
it was the 28 - year - old @entity204 ' fourth career title , and first since january 2011 .			2
