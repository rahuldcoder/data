@entity0 -- @entity3 's jubilee tour strikes an historic note today , when the @entity6 monarch visits @entity7 on a trip it is hoped will mark a symbolic end to the decades - long conflict there			1
she 's been to the province almost every year over the last decade			2
but this visit is especially significant as it follows her tour of the @entity16 last year			2
it was the first visit by a @entity6 head of state since @entity20 's independence , and at the time , @entity6 prime minister @entity21 described it as a game - changer			0
as head of state of the @entity6 of @entity25 and @entity7 , the queen has a purely symbolic role			1
but her influence - after six decades on the throne - is palpable			0
and her ability to mark an historic turning point unquestioned			0
despite the passing of 15 years since the signing of the @entity34 , resentment among @entity7 's @entity35 - both @entity31 - has lingered over the wrongs committed during @entity6 rule			1
@entity3 arrives in @entity7 but the queen 's visit last year helped to heal some of those wounds			1
in @entity41 she visited @entity42 , where @entity6 forces killed @entity20 civilians at a gaelic football match in 1920 , on what became known as @entity47			0
at a state dinner the same day , there were gasps as she spoke in @entity51			0
the @entity20 president was seen mouthing the word ' wow ' and commentators declared the speech historic			0
the queen managed subtly to set the tone of a visiting head of state as opposed to a ruling one			0
the image was powerful and cathartic for those still bitter towards @entity25			1
" it is a sad and regrettable reality that through history our islands have experienced more than their fair share of heartache , turbulence and loss , " she said			0
in @entity7 , the queen has the chance to make history again -- but this time it is personal			1
the queen 's cousin , @entity75 , was assassinated by the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) in 1979 , using a bomb planted in his fishing boat			1
three others died in the same explosion			0
the queen was devastated : @entity75 had introduced her to his nephew , prince @entity83 , during her teens ; the pair went on to marry and have four children			2
after decades of struggle , key republicans in @entity7 are ready to have their symbolic moment of peace with the " @entity3 , " as they call her			1
@entity91 has decided that @entity93 icon and @entity7 's deputy first minister , @entity94 , should shake hands with the queen in front of the cameras			1
@entity94 is a former @entity77 commander			1
what makes this simple handshake even more poignant is that the queen is not just representing the @entity6 , she 's also representing the victims of the sectarian conflict			2
as someone who lost a loved one in an @entity77 attack , she is one herself			2
with a simple gesture , a victim and a former man of violence will put their personal feelings aside in the name of duty , and in the name of peace .			0

@entity25 's @entity3 visiting @entity7 on jubilee tour
during the trip she will meet -- and shake hands with -- former @entity77 figure @entity94
meeting a symbolic moment of peace between two sides of sectarian *divide*
@entity3 's cousin , lord @entity75 , was assassinated by the @entity77 in 1979
