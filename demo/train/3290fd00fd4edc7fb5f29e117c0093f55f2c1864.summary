he sought to assuage concerns about @entity3 's rising economic and military power , declaring that his country " will never seek hegemony or pursue an expansionist policy			1

" we are building " a socialist country under the rule of law , " he asserted			0

neither man attended wednesday night 's @entity53 state dinner in honor of the @entity3 leader			1
earlier in the week , @entity50 called @entity2 a " dictator " -- a word that was later recanted by his spokesman			2

" @entity52 noted that concerns related to tensions on the @entity69 also were raised during thursday 's talks			0
we had " a good meeting , " @entity52 said			0
" i would hope that the dialogue on all of these subjects would continue			0
" disagreements over human rights -- including @entity3 's treatment of imprisoned @entity79 laureate @entity78 -- were " raised very strongly , " according to rep. @entity80 of @entity81 , the top @entity82 on the @entity83			1
" i would not indicate there was great engagement ... other than a general recognition by the president of @entity3 that they have a ways to go , " @entity84 told reporters			2
on wednesday , @entity2 met with president @entity92 behind closed doors at the @entity53 for several hours as top officials from both countries worked to address issues tied to the global economic crisis , international security , the environment and human rights			1

the contracts will support an estimated 235,000 @entity6 jobs , according to the @entity53			0
the two leaders acknowledged continuing differences on human rights , but pledged to keep working on the matter in a " frank and candid way , " according to @entity92			1
human rights remains a touchy subject in @entity3 , as censors in the @entity120 nation made clear during @entity2 's visit by blacking out @entity1 's news broadcast each time the topic of human rights was mentioned			1
even when @entity2 spoke about human rights , it was blacked out			1
censors also blacked the network out in @entity3 whenever a @entity1 report mentioned or showed video of @entity78			0
footage of anti-china protesters near the @entity53 was similarly blacked out			0
@entity92 has nevertheless hailed @entity2 's visit as a chance to lay a foundation for the next 30 years of @entity38			1
" at a time when some doubt the benefits of cooperation between the @entity6 and @entity3 , this visit is ... a chance to demonstrate a simple truth , " @entity92 said wednesday			1

" under " new circumstances , and in the face of new challenges , @entity3 and the @entity6 share broad common interests and important common responsibilities , " he said			0
" @entity3 and the @entity6 should respect each other 's choice of development path and each other 's core interests			2
" the formal state dinner for @entity2 on wednesday evening was the third such occasion of @entity92 's administration			1

@entity179 and @entity180 provided entertainment after the dinner			0
the last @entity53 state dinner for @entity3 was in october 1997 , when @entity169 welcomed president @entity184 and his wife , @entity186			2

during a news conference with reporters wednesday , @entity92 said he had received a promise from @entity2 to establish a more " level playing field " for @entity6 trade			1

a @entity69 with no nuclear weapons remains a key goal for both leaders , @entity92 stressed			2
@entity92 also defended his administration 's decision to engage with @entity3 despite differences over hot - button issues such as human rights			1
@entity92 said that " @entity3 has a different political system than we do " and is at a " different stage of development			1
" " i have been very candid with president @entity2 about these issues , " he told reporters , and " occasionally , they are a source of tension			2
" @entity2 defended his country 's human rights record , arguing that " @entity3 recognizes and also respects the universality of human rights			1
" at the same time , he said , it is important to account for " different national circumstances			0
" " we will continue our efforts to improve the lives of the @entity3 people " and promote " democracy and the rule of law , " he said			0
but @entity0 , he indicated , should respect the principle of " noninterference " in domestic affairs			0
