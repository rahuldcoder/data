-- lingering oil residue at the bottom of @entity5 marshes caused heart defects and hindered reproduction in a small fish seen as an environmental bellwether , researchers said thursday			1
the @entity5 killifish spends its whole life in the marshes of the @entity5 , with few in their lifetimes venturing more than a football field 's length from where they were born			1
because of that , they 've been the subject of several studies since the @entity21 erupted off @entity22 in april 2010			0
the latest , conducted by scientists from @entity24 and @entity25 , found killifish embryos that were exposed to oiled sediments hatched at a rate 40 % lower than those cultivated in samples from un-oiled sites			2
those that did hatch were smaller , had lower heart rates and had cardiovascular deformities that were likely to hurt their chances of survival , said @entity39 , an environmental toxicologist at @entity24			2
" early life exposure affects heart function , and these abnormalities persist until adulthood and make it harder for fish to survive , evade predators and eat , " @entity39 said			1
the findings were published online this week in the peer - reviewed journal @entity49			0
co-author @entity50 said the killifish is the " canary in the coal mine " for the @entity5 , where scientists are still trying to catalog the effects of the 2012 disaster			1
" they 're the most abundant fish in these marshes , " said @entity50 , a genome biologist at @entity25			0
" they 're a really important forage species -- that means a lot of the fish that we care about commercially eat them			2
they 're really important as that sort of middleman member of the community ... their biology is going to reflect the quality of their local environment			0
" because the oil spread across the @entity5 in patches , @entity50 said it 's still too early to tell what the findings mean for killifish populations overall			1
the study this week is n't a direct sign that the numbers are shrinking , but it 's a warning , he said			2
" any animals that share a similar habitat to our killifish are going to be at similar risk to this species , and there are lots of commercial species that we care about that share the same habitat , " he said			1
in earlier studies , scientists observed deformities in the gills of killifish			0
in this study , @entity50 said , " we brought the field into the lab " by collecting water and sediment samples from areas that had gotten hit by oil during the spill , introducing embryonic killifish and comparing the results to fish cultivated in samples from un-oiled sites			1
" what we found were pretty clear and dramatic and pretty obvious development differences in the embryos exposed to the oiled sediments , " he said			0
killifish are typically a few inches long and commonly used as bait			0
there 's no sign that the oil components are accumulating in their meat , but the fish are suffering " massive biological effects " as their systems process the compounds , said @entity24 environmental toxicologist @entity125 , another collaborator on the study			1
researchers are still trying to assess the damage the spill did to the @entity5 , but fishermen in some parts of @entity22 say the catch has yet to recover from the spill			2
oil company @entity134 , which owned the ruptured well and is responsible for the cleanup , announced plans for nearly $ 600 million in restoration projects in @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity22 this week			0
the new research was funded by the @entity143 and the @entity144 , the @entity134 - funded effort to study the environmental impact of the @entity5 spill			1
@entity134 said in a statement friday that while the company had not had a chance to review the data in the new study , " it is important to note that there are many sources of @entity152 ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , or compounds in the oil that settled into the sediments ) and other stressors that elicit the biological effects described in the killifish paper			1
these sources have existed for years in @entity22 marshes , and not all are associated with oil			0
" @entity134 says the spill has cost it more than $ 32 billion to date , including cleanup costs , compensation and penalties			0
it 's currently in a federal court in @entity174 , seeking to avoid a finding of gross negligence that could result in another $ 17 - plus billion in fines under the @entity178 .			0
