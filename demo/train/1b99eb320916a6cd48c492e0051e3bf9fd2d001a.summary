-- as mass protests swept @entity4 on friday , the actions of two key institutions served as indicators for what lies ahead for the embattled regime : the military and the media			1
president @entity10 deployed the @entity4 army for the first time to the streets to quell angry demonstrations against his authoritarian regime			1
that 's a sure sign of the government 's desperation , according to experts on the region			0
and for the first time , the state - run media did n't ignore the unrest or dump on the demonstrations as acts of terrorism in its usual manner			1
that , too , say experts , was a key indicator that @entity10 could be facing trouble			1
it 's a given that the military , a pillar of @entity4 authority since a 1952 coup toppled the monarchy , holds the keys at this critical juncture			2
many feared that the army will silence the protesters with its firepower and tanks that are now out on the streets of @entity45 and @entity46			0
but @entity47 , a former @entity48 ambassador to @entity4 , said that a military crackdown would be a " death knell not only to the military but the regime			1
" such a crackdown did n't happen in nearby @entity54 , where the authoritarian ruler fled the nation , and it was hardly what happened in @entity4 on friday			1
on the contrary , @entity4 's 450,000 - strong armed forces are well - established and respected by the people			0
journalists reported seeing protesters cheer army convoys as they drove into @entity45 and @entity46			0
some embraced the soldiers on the ground ; they were seen as saviors from excessive police brutality			0
to @entity72 , a professor at @entity73 in @entity74 , the fact that the military was called out friday showed that @entity10 was desperate			1
the all - important question is how loyal the armed forces will remain to the aging leader who has ruled @entity4 with an iron fist for three decades			0
meanwhile , the state - controlled television network walked a tightrope friday			1
early in the day , @entity82 began showing footage of the demonstrations of " tens of thousands of people " and reported the use of police tear gas			2
it aired opposition leaders criticizing the government for shutting down the lines of communication			0
@entity93 , a @entity94 assistant professor who studies international media , said it was unusual for an arm of the government to even cover these events or portray them as anything but acts initiated by unsavory elements of society			0
" i 'm amazed , " @entity93 said of the coverage			0
even with social media and mobile phone messaging blocked , @entity4 could see events unfolding live on international networks including @entity0			0
the @entity4 media may have felt that they would lose all credibility with the people if they were to completely distort the story			0
ultimately , @entity93 said , he suspected fissures within @entity10 's ranks and said some in the government may be thinking of their own future in a nation barely holding back from the brink			2
" what we 're seeing today is parts of the government feeling increasingly isolated from @entity10 or intentionally doing so to hold on to power after @entity10 goes , " he said			2
by the end of the day , however , @entity82 's coverage shifted , reverting to words like " hooliganism " and " lawlessness " to describe the demonstrations			2
@entity131 , who has studied @entity4 media in depth , said friday 's media coverage could mean that @entity10 has no one left to blame , so he gave the protesters , many of whom are young people , a little wiggle room			1
" the state media is walking a fine line to give credit to the young people , but in the meantime , it has to justify intervention and crackdown , " @entity72 said			1
@entity131 said things will get really thorny if @entity4 's impoverished masses join hands with the protesters -- believed to be largely from the educated middle classes -- and the demonstrations grow to even more chaotic proportions			0
that 's when the military and the state - run media will both have to come to terms with events in their country			1
that 's when @entity10 , @entity72 said , may realize that he can shut down @entity160 but not the @entity161 .			2

@entity10 called out the army friday to help quell the protests
the military will play a key role in what happens next
in the past , the state - run media have ignored protests or *downplayed* them
friday , @entity82 showed the clashes but also justified the crackdown
