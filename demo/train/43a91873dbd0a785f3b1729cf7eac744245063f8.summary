-- shortly after the clock struck midnight , two @entity2 women legitimized their 35 - year love affair early thursday by becoming the first same - sex couple to receive a marriage license in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the two women met on a blind date in 1977 , when homosexuality was highly taboo and gay people socialized privately in homes , never in public			1
now @entity15 is 85 and @entity16 is 77 , and they have lived to see the world transformed			1
in the twilight of their lives , they thought they would die without being legally married , though they had a church wedding in 2005			1
but @entity8 voters approved @entity26 , legalizing same - sex marriage , last month , allowing the first licenses to be issued on thursday			1
" oh , my goodness ! " @entity16 said			2
" we 've been together 35 years and seen all kinds of change			2
" " it 's been a long journey , " @entity15 said			2
" we 're so excited to know we 'll get a license and then get married on sunday			1
" voters approve same - sex marriage for the first time @entity8 gov. @entity40 and secretary of state @entity41 certified @entity42 , surrounded by the marriage equality bill 's supporters			1
" this is a very important and historic day in the great state of @entity8			1
for many years now , we 've said , ' one more step			2
' this is our last step , " @entity40 said			2
" to the couples that are here today that will finally be treated with the equality they 've deserved for many years , congratulations to each of you			2

" fortunately , we 're blessed by nice looks so people did n't know right off the bat we were gay or homosexuals			2
