@entity0 -- with the conventions fading into the rearview mirror and the first presidential debate fast approaching , new polls in crucial swing states suggest that @entity9 nominee @entity8 's road to the @entity10 is becoming a more challenging ride			1
polls are a snapshot of how people feel right now			0
the election is still 6Â½ weeks away , with three presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate between now and then that have the potential to change people 's minds			0
but the numbers in many of these new surveys seem to favor president @entity25 over @entity8			1
" throughout the spring and summer , @entity8 advisers would look at the mostly dead - even polls and tell me , ' i 'd a lot rather be in our position than theirs , ' " said @entity1 chief political correspondent @entity26			2
" they do n't say that now , not because it 's over -- clearly whatever edge the president has can be erased			0
they do n't say that anymore because as fall opens , advantage @entity25			2
" @entity1 's @entity41 @entity8 was asked about the new surveys in an interview friday that will appear on @entity45 's " @entity44 " on sunday			2
" actually , we 're tied in the polls			2
we 're all within a margin of error			0
we bounce around week to week , day to day			0
there are some days we 're up			0
there are some days we 're down , " @entity8 said			2
" we 've got a campaign which is tied with an incumbent president of the @entity54			1
" to win the @entity10 , @entity8 needs to win all the states that sen. @entity56 carried in 2008 , plus grab back about half a dozen that @entity25 turned from red to blue four years ago			1
@entity8 campaigned thursday in @entity59 , where two nonpartisan live operator polls conducted over the past two weeks both indicate @entity25 has a five - point advantage , which is within the surveys ' sampling errors			1
both the @entity68 / @entity67 / @entity66 and @entity69 polls have the race at 49 % -44 %			0
other , partisan surveys released since the end of the @entity74 convention suggest a closer contest			0
@entity59 's 29 electoral votes are the biggest catch of the nine or so battleground states that both campaigns are heavily contesting			1
in @entity80 , an @entity68 / @entity67 / @entity66 poll and a @entity69 survey each have the president holding a seven - point lead , while an @entity86 survey shows @entity25 with a two - point edge , well within that poll 's sampling error			2
and in @entity92 , a @entity91 poll indicates @entity25 leading by eight points , while a @entity69 survey shows the president up by seven			2
according to a @entity99 / @entity98 / @entity97 poll , @entity25 holds a four - point advantage , which is within that survey 's sampling error			1
president @entity103 won all three of those states in his 2004 re-election , but @entity25 painted them blue four years ago			1
in @entity111 , home of @entity8 's running mate , rep. @entity108 , a @entity110 poll indicates the @entity74 ticket with a 14 - point lead over the @entity9 duo			1
but a @entity99 / @entity45 / @entity97 poll indicates a smaller six - point advantage for the president , and @entity25 is up by five points in an @entity68 / @entity67 / @entity66 poll			1
@entity25 stumps in surprise battleground state in @entity122 , the state where @entity8 was born and where his father served as a popular two - term governor in the 1960s , a @entity1 / @entity127 poll released on wednesday indicated @entity25 up by eight points			1
an @entity130 / @entity129 survey released the week before suggested the president was up by 10			0
both @entity111 and @entity122 are states @entity74 have long carried in presidential elections that the @entity8 campaign hopes to capture			2
new polls in two other battleground states , @entity137 and @entity138 ( won by @entity103 in 2004 but by @entity25 in 2008 ) , indicate much closer contests			1
" for a campaign running one to two points behind , close polls are interesting in the spring and summer			0
they are worrisome in the fall , " said @entity26 , anchor of @entity1 's " @entity143			0
" " the good news for the @entity8 campaign is every and any place the president is polling below 50 % -- not a comfortable position for an incumbent			1
" former president @entity151 , who has campaigned for @entity25 and gave a blockbuster speech at the @entity74 ' convention , says the race is far from over			2
" i still think you have to assume it 's going to be a close race , assume it 's a hard fight and then fight through it , " @entity151 said in an interview with @entity156 on @entity1			0
" but i think the president has the advantage now			0
we did have a very good convention			0
he got a good boost out of it			0
" @entity151 : ' 47 percent ' comments put ' heavier burden ' on @entity8 in debates @entity8 's campaign has struggled since the conventions			0
the release of secretly recorded video from a may fundraiser , in which @entity8 casts @entity25 supporters as dependent on government , dominated coverage of the race over the past week			1
and the week before , there was criticism in the media and even by some @entity9 of @entity8 's response to the attacks against @entity54 embassies in @entity187 and @entity188			1
but @entity9 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity189 says @entity8 has already proved this cycle that he can make a comeback			1
" despite the toughest two weeks of this campaign for @entity8 , these state polls tell us two things : one , this is still a jump ball ; two , @entity25 has gotten slightly taller			1
" " @entity8 has proven resilient throughout this campaign , " said @entity189 , a senior media adviser to @entity8 's 2008 campaign			2
" now he 's being tested again			0
he has to show voters he has presidential strength , the capacity to get back on his feet after being knocked down			1
" and @entity8 has 6Â½ weeks to do that			0
@entity8 , @entity108 in fighting shape			0

@entity25 holds advantage in polls in several key battleground states
@entity8 sees being tied with incumbent president as advantage for challenger
@entity8 must win all the @entity215 won in 2008 and a half dozen that @entity25 won
@entity9 strategist : @entity8 has been resilient , must show voters he can get back on his feet
