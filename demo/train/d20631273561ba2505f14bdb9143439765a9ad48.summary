one of the triggering points for her to finally shed pounds was when a 5 - year - old child patted her stomach and asked : " when is the baby coming ? " " i about died , " she said			1
" i was n't even remotely pregnant , just really overweight			2
" @entity1 , a 39 - year old instructional designer , artist and consultant from @entity10 , @entity11 , lost about 100 pounds , starting from 264 to a low of 155			1

" i was facing an age deadline to get back and knew that once i turned 42 years old , it would be forever too late , " he said			2
the new year represents a time to create resolutions and for many @entity30 , weight loss will be high on their lists			1
and while @entity1 and @entity16 's weight loss stories are a success , experts say most people will fail at following through on their resolutions			1
clinical psychologist @entity37 of @entity38 , @entity11 , says some people sabotage themselves by not being clear on their goals			1
he offers some tips for getting it right			2
be specific about your goal			2
" saying that you want to lose weight is way too general , " @entity37 said			2
" you should set specific goals , like you want to lose 5 to 10 pounds			1
make sure you set something achievable and sustainable			2
establish a plan to reach your goal			0
" say things like i 'm going to exercise four times a week , and i 'm going to eat smaller portions , " said @entity37			0
set a time frame to reach your goal			0
" thirty days is a manageable goal to start with , and then go from there , " he said			0
above all , @entity37 says stay the course			0
" you will make mistakes , " he said			0
" you will have slip - ups , it is part of it			0
" but never use it as an excuse to give up			0
a website supported by the @entity68 notes " the key to successful weight loss is making changes in your eating and physical activity habits that you can keep up for the rest of your life			1
" and even if you do n't need to lose weight , it 's a good idea to follow healthy eating and exercise habits to keep you healthy throughout your lifetime			1
how did @entity1 and @entity16 shed pounds ? when @entity1 first started her journey , she set a goal of fitting into a size 14			1
" i did n't know how long it would take , but i felt like i could accomplish that in a year and i did , " she said			0
she now wears a size 10 or 12 , which exceeded her plan			0
@entity1 said when she first started losing weight , she set a goal of exercising six days a week , and three of those days were 22 minutes of cardiovascular moves			1
after a few months into her body - for life - program , her job required her to travel a lot and she cut back her workouts to three to four days a week			0
@entity1 changed her eating habits , too , and stopped eating junk food			1

@entity16 had a different plan to shed his pounds			2
at the height of his exercise program , he spent up to five hours a day working out			0
his routine included walking , biking , swimming , lifting weights and burning calories on a treadmill or @entity129			0
the @entity130 restricted his diet to about 1,500 calories a day			0
" i did n't have any time to waste or any days when i could afford not to exercise and eat properly if i wanted to qualify with the right weight for the guard , " he said			2
" i had a few times during that heavy - duty weight loss period when i would go out and ride 20 miles on my bike at 11 p.m. or midnight , because i had n't exercised yet that day and i would n't let myself go to sleep having missed a day , " he noted			1
both @entity1 and @entity16 were motivated to reach their goals , but experts differ on their opinions on how much exercise is necessary and what type of foods to eat in order to lose weight			1
for those of you planning a weight - loss program in 2011 , consider guidelines the @entity68 offers on its website to help you get started			1
losing weight can be a challenge @entity1 said before her big weight loss , she tried a lot of methods to lose pounds , including drugs prescribed by her doctor			1
" in 2000 , they tested my thyroid and found it to be very slow , and i was prescribed 300 mg of @entity161 a day and told it would help , " she said			0
six months later , she returned to her doctor in tears and said the drugs were n't helping			0
" my doc shrugged it off and said ' fat people are jolly			2
" she struggled for a few more years until a friend visiting from @entity169 , @entity170 , in 2004 helped her get started on the diet and exercise regime he used			0
" at last , i finally found a program that worked , " she said			0
@entity16 said he struggled for years as a heavy person and said he weighed more than 300 pounds for about an 11 - year stretch			2
for him , the motivation to achieve a dream is what it took to finally get him back to better health			0
" i would imagine myself standing , in a nice new suit , in front of the @entity184 , answering their questions about why i wanted to get back into the @entity21 , " he said			0
" i must have imagined that interview with the board a hundred times while working out , " @entity16 noted			0
both @entity1 and @entity16 say the best part of their journey is they are now happier people than they were before the weight loss			1
" i feel great and love to tell people about my story , " said @entity1 .			1
