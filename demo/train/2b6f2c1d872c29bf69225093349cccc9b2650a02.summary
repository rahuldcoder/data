-- despite the fact that it seems to be in the news almost every day of the week , @entity3 -- impossibly vast and fascinatingly diverse -- remains a travel destination with an unquestionable mystique			2
as exciting as that sounds , it also makes travelling to @entity3 for the first time an incredibly daunting prospect			2
to help you venture into the unknown , here 's our first - timer 's guide to the most populated land on the planet			2
@entity0 : a tasty tour of @entity3 1			2
break the language barrier the number one hurdle to overcome when travelling around @entity3 is the language barrier			1
even today , with @entity23 children learning @entity24 from primary school onwards , it 's a barrier that can be almost completely impenetrable at times			1
it 's always advisable to try to learn a few words and phrases before you visit far - flung lands , but in @entity3 it 's almost essential			1
try to enroll in @entity31 classes before you go ( @entity23 is the default language in almost every part of @entity3 ) , or try to teach yourself some of the basics -- the @entity37 website has a decent introduction to learning @entity23			1
then , when you leave for @entity3 , be sure to bring with you one or more of the following : - @entity23 phrasebook - @entity39 and other guidebook publishers offer them			1
- @entity24 - to - @entity23 and @entity3 - to - @entity24 pocket dictionary - i found the @entity45 version very easy to use when i was a beginner			1
- translator apps - @entity48 is free and includes an impressively accurate speak - your - phrase voice translator			1
the @entity39 @entity52 app is similar but has the advantage of being entirely offline with a dictionary tailored to the needs of travelers			2
regardless of all of the above , one thing you should always do when traveling around @entity3 is carry with you @entity23 - language business cards of your hotel or of places you wish to visit so you can show passers - by , taxi drivers , bus conductors and the like			1
focus your itinerary @entity3 is massive			2
really , it 's unbelievably large			2
it contains the world 's highest mountains , some of the world 's largest deserts , remote jungles , seemingly endless grasslands , and , of course , many of the world 's largest cities			0
you would need months and months of traveling to even begin to do it justice			0
so , rather than skimming the surface of the whole country on your first trip , choose one region , or even just one province , and explore it properly			1
do some preliminary research to get a basic sense of each region			1
still unsure ? here 's my top three : - @entity91 : one province ; three regions			1
stay in the center or the south for steamy bamboo forests and cute @entity98 villages			0
head north for stunning lakes set among alpine-esque mountain scenery			0
venture west for remote @entity103 - plateau grasslands			0
- @entity104 : picture - perfect rice terraces and otherworldly karst peaks dominate a lush , almost jungle - like landscape which is perfect for hiking , cycling and river trips			0
- @entity110 : do n't just fly here , stay here			1
@entity110 packs in more world - class sites than many whole countries are able to offer : the @entity114 , @entity115 , the @entity116 , the @entity117 , ancient hutong alleyways , majestic imperial parks ... the list goes on and on			0
check the weather at any time of the year there are places in @entity3 that enjoy ideal weather for travel , but almost nowhere is weather - perfect all year round			0
so to ensure your first trip to @entity3 does n't become a wind - beaten blowout , an energy - sapping sun - scorcher or just a damp squib , get on top of where 's hot and where 's not in the month you 're planning to travel			1
generally speaking spring and autumn are the most comfortable seasons , although not in all provinces , and in many parts of @entity3 spring and autumn are no more than a few weeks long			0
for starters , check out this @entity3 weather rundown			0
@entity0 : top 10 works of engineering genius 4			0
use public transport ditch the taxis and the airplanes and hop on buses , bikes and trains to see @entity3 how the locals see it			0
sure , it 's easier flying from city to city , and then taking a taxi around each one once you 're there			0
but where 's the fun in it ? @entity3 's public transport systems are already extensive , and getting bigger and better every year and many towns and cities are well set up for cycling -- cycle lanes abound in @entity110 , for instance			0
and do n't worry about getting lost			1
@entity23 people in general are extremely friendly , helpful and honest , especially to foreigners who ca n't speak @entity23 , so there will always be a local on hand to put you back on track if you lose your way			1
eat , eat and then eat some more @entity3 has many wonderful features but arguably its standout attraction is its food			0
cuisine varies tremendously from region to region -- even breakfast time can be an assault on the senses -- so try as much of it as you can			1
and do n't listen to anyone who tells you to avoid the street food			1
it 's often the best part of a city 's culinary experience			0
one final food tip from my aunt , who recently visited @entity3 for the first time : if you 're not used to using chopsticks , ditch the white t - shirts and pack more dark - colored tops			2
noodle - slurping stains are an unavoidable nuisance for most @entity3 first - timers , and asking for a knife and fork in a restaurant over here ... well , that 's just cheating			0
