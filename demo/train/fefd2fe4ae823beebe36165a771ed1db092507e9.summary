-- last week 's rumor was the real deal : @entity3 is rolling out a new @entity5 inbox today which autosorts incoming messages so important stuff is easy to find and clutter stays out of the way			1
wait : does n't @entity5 's @entity10 do that ? well , yes			1
but the new inbox ( which you can choose to use if you 're not using @entity10 ) is a different take on the same general concept			2
instead of attempting to figure out which messages matter most to you and then promoting them to the top of your inbox , the new one sticks tabs across the top â € ” up to five of them , for " primary " messages ( basically , ones from real people , plus anything else you have n't chosen to weed out ) , @entity30 ( stuff like @entity31 and @entity33 updates ) , @entity28 ( ads ) , @entity39 ( bills , notifications , etc. ) and forums ( mailing lists and the like )			1
each tab indicates how many unread messages you 've got in that category , so you can monitor incoming messages even if they do n't pop up on your current tab			0
conceptually , this is simpler than @entity10 , since @entity5 is only trying to sort messages into general categories rather than figure out which people are more important to you than others			1
( i 've been using the new version for a few days , and the sorting seems to work really well )			0
and you need to proactively click around to other tabs to see less - important messages , so the @entity60 tab feels more streamlined than @entity10 's stacked - inboxes approach ( the latter feels a tad cluttered , at least to me )			2
bottom line : the new inbox is an interesting option for folks who have n't warmed to @entity10			0
like , for instance , me â € ” i admire @entity10 , but tend to use it for a bit , then turn it off , then try it again			0
the new inbox is rolling out to users over the coming weeks ; it 'll also be available in @entity5 's @entity69 and @entity70 apps			0
it 's good to see a major new @entity5 feature debut in both old - school and mobile @entity5 at the same time â € ” and for a while , at least , this is going to be the @entity5 inbox i 'll use			1
