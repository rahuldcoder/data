-- drones are our latest frankenstein 's monster			1
but our preoccupation with their novelty -- with the ethical hazards of remote killing and the possible violation , through surveillance , of life and privacy at home -- has obscured their roots in the deadly history of @entity17 aerial control of the @entity18 that began in @entity19 , exactly a century ago			1
as we recall the myriad ways in which that epochal war remade our world , it is time also to reckon with its unleashing of air power in the @entity18			1
air power harks back to @entity29 - era hot - air balloons and was used all over the theaters of @entity19 for reconnaissance , bombardment , and aerial combat			1
however , its potential was most rigorously tested and developed in the @entity37 campaign against the @entity38 during that war			1
aerial photography and signaling , the airlift , the aerial trap ( bombardment of the head and tail of a column retreating through a canyon ) -- all were developed in @entity19 's @entity51 and @entity52 campaigns , fought in the area of present - day @entity54 and the @entity55 , north through @entity56			1
opinion : how a century - old war affects you the @entity37 fought these campaigns to safeguard the all - important land , air , and sea routes to @entity64 and oil assets in the @entity66			1
aircraft were used in bombardments that wrecked trains and in irregular warfare , where they , for example , helped @entity74 guerrillas fighting the @entity37 - backed revolt against the @entity38 communicate and conduct reconnaissance			2
they were also used in deception strategies , such as in providing air cover to conceal troop movements before the surprise @entity37 attack at @entity82			2
most significantly , for the history of drones , their uses in colonial policing were discovered there and would echo through the century			1
when the tribes the @entity37 had " liberated " from @entity97 rule in the war " got out of hand , " aerial bombardment became an instrument of everyday colonial discipline , inspiring " terror in the @entity74 , " official memos noted approvingly			1
opinion : when chemical weapons killed 90,000 @entity67 seemed a panacea for what the @entity37 categorized as " tribal " situations			2
thus did the postwar @entity104 declare that it was in the @entity18 that " the war ... proved that the air has capabilities of its own			1
" we may have forgotten this past , but in the region , memory of it shapes the response to @entity114 drones and airstrikes today			2
all this came about because of @entity19 - era @entity37 notions of the particular suitability of air power to the @entity18			1
officials who guided the military effort in the region saw it as a land of mystery impervious to ordinary observation			0
surveillance aircraft seemed to promise vision beyond the mirages , sandstorms , and distances that made it unmappable in their estimation			0
commanders relied on them for " obtaining ... accurate information '' in a land where '' little can be trusted that is seen			0
" and they provided access to forbidden sites			0
conceiving the region as uniformly flat ( despite its marshes , mountains and cities ) , @entity37 arabists assumed it afforded no cover			2
in fact , there were real limits to using aircraft even in the desert , but the idea of " knights of the air " providing panoramic surveillance of an inscrutable antique land proved irresistible			2
so too did the image of aircraft turning @entity51 into a hub of modern transportation and thus restoring its status as the cradle of civilization , in some measure redeeming the material and human losses of the war			0
opinion : should nations pay the price for their leaders ' misdeeds ? @entity37 officials made much of the " natural fellow - feeling between ... nomad arabs and the @entity175 ... both ... in conflict with the vast elemental forces of nature			0
" arabs could uniquely endure the violence of bombardment , @entity37 thought : in a biblical land , tragedy was a " normal way of life " and bombardment understood as an " act of @entity186			0
" these wartime experiments with aerial bombardment and surveillance produced the postwar " aerial control " regime in the region , a discreet and cheap mechanism for colonial rule in an increasingly anti-imperial world			0
because the @entity37 thought of the @entity18 as a region where all information was suspect and deception was everywhere , they saw casualty counts and accountability for errors -- like bombardment of the wrong town or tribe -- as superfluous			1
opinion : how @entity19 gave us ' cooties ' after the war , the @entity37 @entity212 survived as an independent military service , rechristened the @entity215 , because of this role in the @entity18			1
the @entity37 used the @entity215 to police the new @entity37 territories in the @entity18 with aerial surveillance and bombardment			1
this technique , known as " aerial control , " spread to @entity52 , @entity222 , @entity223 , and what we call " @entity226 " -- precisely where drones reign today			0
it was in @entity54 and @entity228 that @entity37 airmen in @entity19 and the interwar period -- including @entity231 , zealous head of @entity232 in @entity233 -- acquired the experience they applied in the next world war			1
opinion : the mighty women of @entity19 the @entity37 state propagated a myth of successful air control in the @entity18 , but the technique never really worked			1
the @entity37 presence provoked insurgency and undermined local governments until the @entity54 revolution of 1958 , when the @entity114 began its interventions in the region			0
those who live under drones see them as the latest chapter in a long history of @entity17 efforts to dominate the region with air power			1
the " @entity255 " dropping " hellfire " missiles again styles bombardment as a biblical fate			0
today , too , casualties are not published and all the dead in a strike zone are presumed to be militants			0
opinion : the ' bionic men ' of @entity19 we would do well to recall this aerial history of the very region where drones found their initial justification			2
remote piloting was always an objective of aerial warfare ; drones follow rocket warfare and cruise missiles			0
aerial warfare was always about minimizing casualties on one side and pursuing empire discreetly			0
drones may be more precise than earlier aircraft , but the principle of cowing a population with ubiquitous surveillance and exemplary violence , without arousing the ire of a democratic public at home , remains their underlying principle			0
so , too , do notions of the @entity18 's particular suitability to aerial control			2
in our shock at the new , we have overlooked these @entity19 roots			0
in their recovery lies crucial insight into why an aerial strategy will fail in the @entity18 , piloted remotely or on the spot			0

@entity307 : unleashing of air power in @entity19 *resonates* in drone use today
remote killing , surveillance used throughout war theater , but mostly by @entity37 in @entity18
air power gave @entity37 access to remote lands ; they *'d* later use it for colonial policing
@entity307 : today 's drones are a new chapter in @entity324 's efforts to dominate @entity18
