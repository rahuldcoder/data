@entity0 , @entity1 -- the bumper sticker reading " @entity4 is @entity6 " was torn off and the car was keyed			1
a police report was filed in the august 16 incident involving maj. @entity10 's @entity9 , and a neighbor was charged with criminal mischief			1
but what kind of impact that incident , and possibly others , had on @entity10 remains a mystery			1
while few official details have been released about @entity10 , his family and others have given some insight into the man accused of killing 13 people and wounded 38 others in thursday 's massacre at @entity24 in @entity1			1
relatives say @entity10 , a @entity26 - born citizen of @entity28 descent , was a " calm " individual who had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001			1
others describe him as a vocal opponent to the war on terror whose rhetoric concerned colleagues			0
the bumper sticker incident at @entity10 's apartment complex in @entity37 , @entity1 , is the first known example of harassment that has surfaced since the shooting			1
apartment manager @entity41 said friday that he reported the situation to police after the girlfriend of then - resident @entity45 told him that he did it			1
@entity41 said he saw @entity45 apologize to @entity10 and that a police report was filed			1
he added that the bumper sticker said " @entity4 is @entity6 " in @entity48 , but that @entity45 knew that @entity10 was @entity49 before seeing it			1
@entity41 said the last time he asked @entity51 about the incident , @entity10 said he was still waiting for reparations for damage to his 2006 @entity55			1
efforts to reach @entity45 on friday were unsuccessful			0
@entity10 's cousin , @entity51 , said the @entity59 major had wanted to leave the military because he felt disrespected over his religion			1
" there was racism towards him because he 's a @entity49 , because he 's an @entity68 , because he prays , " the cousin said in a @entity2 interview in the @entity28 city of @entity65			1
" they used to see him dress in traditional @entity49 clothing , so he was a bit irritated because of this			2
also , the fact that they wanted to send him to @entity75			0
he decided to leave the @entity59 for good and hire a lawyer because of this matter			0
" " they would n't treat him as if he is one of them			2
he was a major in the @entity59 and other majors would n't treat him equally as a major should be treated , " the cousin said			2
" ' yes , you are a major in the @entity59 , but you are still an @entity68 , a @entity49 , you have your own traditions and values and we have ours			2
' he was bothered by that a lot			0
he was n't respected as he should have been			0
" the cousin added that he wanted to leave the @entity59 , especially after getting deployment orders			0
@entity59 officials have indicated that @entity10 was to deploy to @entity91 to work with a unit already there as part of behavioral health support			2
it was n't clear when @entity10 was scheduled to go overseas for what would have been his first deployment			1
dr. @entity98 , a former medical school classmate of @entity10 's , described him as " a very outspoken opponent of the war " in the classroom and in public settings			1
" he equated the war against terror with a war against @entity106 , " @entity98 said			0
he added that he was shocked by thursday 's shooting			0
" however , that said , given the things that maj. @entity10 has said to me in the past and to other people , i am not surprised			1
" there are about 3,500 muslims in the @entity59 , less than 1 percent of the total number of soldiers			0
the investigation into the shootings is ongoing , and @entity59 officials have not indicated any evidence of @entity10 being harassed among the ranks			2
@entity10 's cousin said that despite the concerns over discrimination , a motive behind the shootings still was incomprehensible			1
" if he had killed one or two , i could say that he was defending himself			0
i could say that there could have been a problem between two sides which led to the use of weapons			0
but for one to kill 13 people and injure more than 30 , i personally do n't think that it was because someone was bothering him			0
there is a bigger reason that this happened and no ones knows it besides @entity10			2
" @entity141 remembered his cousin 's trip to @entity144 , 6 miles from @entity65 , 15 years ago to learn about his roots			0
" more recently , @entity10 may have attended a lecture in january at @entity147 involving the @entity149 ambassador to the @entity26 and other officials discussing @entity149 's offensive into @entity152 last winter			1
video from the lecture shows a person who appears to be @entity10 dressed in military fatigues seated in the audience taking notes			2
in a statement friday , @entity10 's family in the @entity26 said , " we are mortified with what has unfolded and there is no justification , whatsoever , for what happened			1
we are all asking why this happened -- and the answer is that we simply do not know			0
" we can not explain , nor do we excuse what happened yesterday			0
yesterday 's violence in no way reflects the feelings , beliefs , or principles of our family , " the statement continued , adding that the family is cooperating with authorities			2
@entity10 's neighbors on friday said he cleaned out his apartment the morning of the shootings and gave copies of the @entity181 to several residents			1
his next - door neighbor , @entity183 , said he gave her his furniture and paid her $ 60 to clean his apartment hours before the shooting			0
" he told me he was leaving for @entity75 or somewhere , " @entity187 said			0
" i did n't think much of it			0
" another neighbor , @entity189 , said @entity10 had helped him set up his laptop and regularly tapped into @entity189 's wireless service			1
@entity189 , a maintenance man at @entity24 who did n't show up for work thursday , said he was interviewed by the @entity193 for four hours that day and the laptop was seized			0
he said he received two calls from @entity51 early thursday , one at 2:37 a.m. asking @entity189 to turn on the wireless service and again at 5 a.m. to say he was moving			0
an owner of a @entity200 convenience store at @entity24 said @entity10 , whom he knew as " @entity201 , " came in for coffee and hash browns most mornings , including the morning of the shootings			2
surveillance video from the store obtained by @entity2 shows a man who the store owner said is @entity10 at the cashier 's counter about 6:20 a.m. thursday -- about seven hours before the shooting -- carrying a beverage and dressed in traditional @entity68 garb			1
while the owner said he was too busy to chat with @entity10 on thursday , he said that through his brief talks with @entity10 he learned the officer did n't speak @entity48 well			1
he added that @entity10 did n't wear a wedding ring and joked several times about whether the owner knew a bride for him			1
@entity10 would also ask the owner whether he planned to attend friday prayers , a mainstay of @entity106 , to which the owner would say that he was too busy			2
@entity10 was known to attend friday prayers in @entity224 , @entity225 , before he arrived at @entity24 this year , said @entity226 , the @entity49 chaplain at the @entity227			1
" i met him a few times and i saw him at services ... he appeared to be a very loyal @entity26 , " @entity226 told @entity2 's " @entity231			0
" " i know he told me once that he joined the military because he wanted to do something for @entity26 in the aftermath of september 11			0
" he also told me once that he believed that @entity49 who speak a language of exclusivity should not have room in the @entity239 -- that we must reject them , " the chaplain continued			2
" and that 's why for me , when i saw the footage yesterday about him , i said , ' wait a minute -- is this the same guy i met a few years ago ? ' "			0
