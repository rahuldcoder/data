@entity0 -- @entity3 and @entity4 negotiators are preparing to resume long - stalled direct talks on wednesday , but news of @entity3 plans for more than 1,000 new settlement units on disputed territory has cast their success into doubt			1
the two sides agreed to return to the negotiating table following intense diplomatic efforts by @entity16 secretary of state @entity15 on a visit to the region last month			0
but the news that @entity3 authorities have given preliminary approval for new settlements in the @entity23 and @entity0 -- considered illegal under international law -- has angered senior @entity4 figures and prompted condemnation from @entity3 's @entity28 allies			1
@entity29 , an @entity3 government spokesman , told @entity1 that the announcement was a " preliminary procedure decision " and that additional decisions would be needed before any construction could start			2
the issue of @entity3 settlement - building in the occupied @entity23 and @entity0 derailed the last round of direct talks in 2010			1
@entity38 , spokesman for the @entity4 presidency , told the official @entity41 news agency that @entity3 's latest settlement plan " aims at obstructing the peace efforts			1
" @entity44 , a member of the executive committee of the @entity46 , deplored the failure of the international community to hold @entity3 accountable for its actions			0
" i think this whole series of settlement expansion , land confiscation will turn any peace initiative into a mockery , any negotiations become a travesty -- there is no possibility of peace with such actions and plans , " she said			2
" @entity3 is destroying the negotiations , @entity3 is destroying any chances of peace , and @entity3 should be made to bear responsibility for this			2
" ' undermine trust ' @entity67 foreign office minister @entity66 called on the @entity3 authorities saturday to reverse its decision to advance plans for 1,096 settlement units in the @entity23 and approve dozens of new units in @entity0			1
" @entity3 settlements are illegal under international law , undermine trust and threaten the viability of the two - state solution , " he said			1
" we urge both parties to continue to show the bold and decisive leadership needed for these efforts to succeed , and to avoid steps that undermine negotiations			0
" @entity84 spokeswoman @entity83 said thursday that the @entity16 had been in touch with the @entity3 government over the decision and was making its concerns known			0
" our position on settlements has not changed			0
we do not accept the legitimacy of continued settlement activity and oppose any efforts to legitimize settlement outposts , " she said			0
@entity83 said she had no indication that the @entity3 announcement would impact on the negotiations			0
@entity15 , she added , " has made clear that he believes both of the negotiating teams are at the table in good faith and are committed to working together to make progress			0
" @entity3 also approved the construction of a 69 - unit settlement in @entity0 -- which @entity4 consider to be the capital of their future state -- just before @entity15 's visit last month			1
@entity4 chief peace negotiator @entity111 said then that the world must act to stop @entity3 building more settlements			1
letting its government get away with it , he said , takes away any motivation for @entity3 to work toward peace			0
the @entity119 angered @entity3 leaders last month when it issued a directive that no @entity119 funding or grants can go to @entity3 settlements outside @entity3 's pre- 1967 borders			2
in january , the @entity126 said @entity3 settlements amount to " creeping annexation " of @entity4 territories by @entity3 and have taken a " heavy toll " on the rights and sovereignty of @entity4			1
