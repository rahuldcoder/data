@entity0 , @entity1 -- the weather system known as @entity4 has been downgraded from a tropical storm to a tropical depression as it moves across the @entity7 -- and there are indications it may not get too much stronger			1
as of 11 p.m. et , the system was moving through the eastern @entity7 after crossing southern @entity1 earlier friday			1
it had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph			0
the depression was moving west - northwest at a very fast clip for such weather systems -- 17 mph			2
forecasters from the @entity18 said the storm was expected to cross over the @entity20 , anywhere from @entity22 to southeastern @entity23 , late saturday night , earlier than had been anticipated previously			1
the fast pace means it wo n't be spending as much time over the warm @entity7 water , leaving less time to build up strength			1
@entity2 meteorologist @entity29 said an area of low pressure in the @entity7 has been creating some competing winds that have been pulling clouds away from the cyclone and weakening it			1
still , the hurricane center said the system may slow , and a tropical storm warning is in effect from @entity40 , @entity1 , to @entity41 , @entity22 , including @entity42			1
and @entity4 still could bring drenching rain to @entity22 and other states along the coast , the hurricane center said , creating a storm surge ranging from two to four feet			1
the hurricane center said @entity4 could bring one to three inches of rain across the region , with rainfall of five inches in some areas			0
@entity4 made landfall as a tropical storm earlier friday near @entity55 in southeastern @entity1 , with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph			1
but it weakened as it crossed over the state			0
even though @entity4 has weakened , uncertainty over the weather already has hampered operations at @entity63 's cripped well in the @entity7			1
@entity63 suspended work on a relief well to permanently seal the damaged well			0
and the federal official overseeing the effort , retired adm. @entity68 , ordered ships in the area to shore because of the choppy seas and gusty winds that @entity4 will bring			0
that could delay operations atthe well site for 10 to 14 days			0
but @entity68 said there 's enough confidence in the well 's " integrity " that it will be left capped and closed during the rough weather			2
ships used to skim oil off the surface will have to come ashore as well			0
hundreds have been operating off the coast			0
meanwhile , states of emergency have been declared in both @entity22 and @entity88			1
the emergency declarations are intended to speed state help to local goverments that need it and allow emergency crews to respond more efficiently			0
@entity22 gov. @entity94 said thursday afternoon it 's " good for @entity22 " that the weather system is moving so fast , since it may not strengthen significantly and is likely to move across @entity22 fairly quickly			1
still , he said about a half dozen @entity22 parishes have called for voluntary evacuations from low - lying areas and mobile home parks			1
the @entity22 @entity101 encouraged residents friday to prepare for the storm by pre-applying for @entity105 benefits , previously known as @entity106			1
the program offers help buying groceries for those who do not regularly receive nutrition assistance but who are affected by lost wages or damages because of a disaster			0
officials said that pre-applying does not guarantee benefits but is designed to prevent long waits			0
the weather system earlier drenched the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and the @entity123 as it moved from the @entity124 to the @entity125			2
when it reached @entity1 , residents in @entity127 saw tree branches littering the roads as @entity4 passed through @entity131			2
" it was pouring rain for four to five hours straight , " said @entity132 , a bartender at @entity133			0
but he added , " it 's not that bad			2
it 's like a regular summer storm in @entity0			2
" the storm also slowed business in southern @entity1			1
" we 've had a lot of people call and say they might have to cancel due to the storm , " said @entity141 of @entity142 in @entity143 , @entity1			2
" i had a few people leave a few days early			0
" @entity2 meteorologist @entity149 contributed to this report .			0
