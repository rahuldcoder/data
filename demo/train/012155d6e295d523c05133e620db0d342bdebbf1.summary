after his party 's losses in the midterm elections , president @entity0 will wade into a mass of foreign policy challenges during his trip to @entity7 this week			1
@entity0 made @entity9 's pivot to @entity7 a centerpiece of his foreign policy architecture			1
but some commentators say the president , beset by crises elsewhere , has failed to put words into action			0
" the @entity7 pivot remains more rhetoric than reality , " @entity18 's @entity17 said			0
" having promised a larger @entity9 military presence in the @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , there is little evidence of any of this on the ground			2
" @entity0 arrived monday in @entity30 , where the greater @entity9 focus on @entity7 is viewed with deep suspicion			1
" two prevailing sentiments -- perceived @entity9 - led containment of @entity36 and the threat posed to @entity9 by @entity36 's growing economic and military strength -- have set the two major powers on a confrontational course , " said @entity32 , a senior foreign policy fellow at the @entity33			1
@entity0 is in @entity30 for @entity42 ( @entity42 ) meetings , but he will also hold direct meetings with @entity36 president @entity44 , where sensitive issues like cybersecurity will be on the agenda			1
" to put this crucial bilateral relationship back on track , president @entity0 and president @entity44 must use the summit in @entity30 to deepen mutual understanding and publicly challenge these misperceptions , " @entity32 said in comments published by @entity33			1
" the @entity9 welcomes the rise of a prosperous , peaceful and stable @entity36 , " @entity0 said in a speech monday at the @entity42 ceo @entity57			1
he announced that the @entity9 and @entity36 have agreed to extend the maximum length of tourist , business and student visas for each others ' citizens			1
while in @entity30 , @entity0 also spoke about @entity67 's release of @entity9 detainees @entity69 and @entity70 over the weekend			1
he said the release did not involve high - level talks on any pressing issues between @entity67 and the @entity9			1
isis fight in new phase , @entity0 says @entity77 reforms ' sliding backwards ' after @entity36 , @entity0 will travel to @entity77 , a country where , two years ago , he became the first sitting @entity9 president to visit			1
there was much fanfare then about the introduction of political reforms after decades of oppressive military rule			0
the opening up of @entity77 , also known as @entity77 , became held up as a positive example of @entity9 engagement in @entity7			2
but concerns are now rife about the halting progress of those changes and the plight of the @entity92 minority group , the @entity93			0
" since the high point of @entity77 's reform process in 2012 and early 2013 , the country 's political opening has stalled and , in my opinion , slid backwards , " wrote @entity94 , a senior fellow for @entity7 at the @entity95			0
he said @entity0 , who will be attending regional summits in the country , should pressure the @entity77 government to push ahead with political changes and rethink its " racist " plan for the @entity93			2
but a senior @entity9 official cautioned not to expect any major leaps forward any time soon			0
" i do n't think we 're going to see breakthroughs in the short term , " @entity108 , the @entity9 assistant secretary of state for human rights and labor , told @entity18 's @entity110 last week			1
" @entity77 was an opening to a breakthrough and it 's one that we always knew would take years to move from its starting point to its finishing point			0
" will @entity0 and @entity119 meet ? the last country on @entity0 's itinerary is @entity26 , where the @entity123 summit will take place in @entity125			2
he plans to deliver " a very significant policy address discussing @entity9 leadership in the @entity135 , " as well as holding a trilateral meeting with the @entity26 and @entity128 prime ministers , @entity129 , senior director for @entity131 affairs at the @entity132 , said friday			2
but much attention will be focused on how @entity0 will navigate the presence of @entity138 president @entity119 , who has angered @entity140 leaders with his aggressive actions in @entity142			0
they already suspended @entity138 from the @entity144 , the group of leading industrialized nations , earlier this year			0
but @entity119 will be in @entity125 for the @entity123 , and could even bump into @entity0 earlier in the week at the @entity42 meetings in @entity30			2
@entity9 national security adviser @entity147 did n't rule out the possibility of an encounter in @entity125			0
" i imagine , as in the past , that there will be an opportunity for the @entity123 leaders to engage informally on the margins , " she said at a news briefing friday			0
" there 's no formal bilateral meeting scheduled or planned , but i would n't be at all surprised if they had some informal communication			0
" the two leaders had a brief conversation about the @entity142 crisis on the sidelines of the @entity164 commemorations in @entity165 in june .			0

@entity0 : @entity67 's release of @entity9 did n't involve major talks on pressing issues
the @entity9 " welcomes the rise of a prosperous , peaceful and stable @entity36 , " @entity0 says
he announces an agreement with @entity30 to extend the maximum length of visas
the @entity9 president will visit @entity77 and @entity26 later this week
