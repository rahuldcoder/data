the @entity1 in @entity2 has ruled that football players at @entity4 are employees and can unionize , the board said wednesday			1
in a statement , @entity4 acknowledged the ruling and says it plans to appeal			1
read the board 's ruling ( @entity9 ) the players ' petition was a way to get a seat at the bargaining table in college sports and could change the landscape of the @entity18 model			1
@entity4 fought the petition by saying its players are students , not employees			1
but the board 's decision indicates that there was enough evidence presented that the athletes are employees of the university -- getting paid in the form of scholarships , working between 20 and 50 hours per week and generating millions of dollars for their institutions			2
the athletes have said they 're seeking better medical coverage , concussion testing , four - year scholarships and the possibility of being paid			2
but while former @entity4 quarterback @entity36 said he agrees with the reform issues set forth by the @entity38 and other groups , he does n't think unionizing is the way to achieve those goals			1
" while we agree with @entity38 's stated objectives , the decision made by the @entity1 today is disconcerting to those of us that care deeply about the future success & stability of @entity4 athletics , " @entity36 said			1
@entity51 , labor law professor at @entity52 , said the ruling has " vast implications for the structure of the sport , if upheld			2
" but he noted an appeal would likely take years to resolve			0
the regional @entity1 office said any requests for review of its decision must be filed with the board 's headquarters in @entity65 by april 9			1
the @entity18 promptly said that while it was n't party to the proceeding , it was " disappointed " with the board 's ruling and disagreed " with the notion that student - athletes are employees			1
" " we frequently hear from student - athletes , across all sports , that they participate to enhance their overall college experience and for the love of their sport , not to be paid , " said the statement from @entity18 chief legal officer @entity76			1
" while improvements need to be made , we do not need to completely throw away a system that has helped literally millions of students over the past decade alone attend college			2
" we want student - athletes -- 99 percent of whom will never make it to the professional leagues -- focused on what matters most -- finding success in the classroom , on the field and in life			1
" last week , @entity4 's president emeritus said that if the football players were successful forming a union , he could see the prestigious private institution giving up @entity96 football			1
" if we got into collective bargaining situations , i would not take for granted that the @entity101 of the world would continue to play @entity96 sports , " @entity97 said at the annual conference for the @entity99			0
he further said that if the players won their fight , private institutions with high academic standards -- he specifically cited @entity108 and @entity109 -- could abandon the current model in order to preserve academic integrity			1
he compared it to the pullback of the @entity116 schools decades ago , when the @entity116 conference decided to opt out of postseason play and to end athletic scholarships , preserving the emphasis on academics for the players			0
" in the 1950s , the ' @entity116 ' had some of the highest - ranked football teams in the country			2
the @entity126 teams were ranked in the top 5 or 10 at that time			0
they continue periodically to have ranked basketball teams , but they 've given up a certain kind of model of sports , " he said , adding that " under certain conditions " the same could happen at other private elite universities that " continue to play big time sports			0
" @entity136 , senior associate athletic director at @entity126 , said that change for the @entity116 allowed those schools to maintain academic integrity in the sports where , at other schools , academics can often be compromised in the name of the game			0
" it was sort of a breaking point moment , " @entity136 said , saying the @entity116 schools made the decision not to move forward like the bigger conferences -- to " draw the line with the commercialization of what football was becoming			0
" " and the results have been that @entity155 football is not what it was in the first half of the 20th century , " @entity136 said			0
" certainly not like @entity159 football , @entity160 football			0
its crowds are generally less than 10,000 people			0
they play only 10 games a year			0
... certainly not what is going on at @entity166 level			0
" @entity97 , who was president of @entity4 from 1995 to 2009 , made his comments during a panel discussion that included a presentation from @entity170 , the president of the @entity171 ( @entity171 ) and the man who helped organize another former @entity4 quarterback , @entity173 , to lead a unionization attempt			1
@entity175 talked , as he has for months , about the issues his organization sees as great flaws in the current @entity18 model			2
the @entity171 believes that athletes in the revenue - generating sports of college football and men 's basketball are taken advantage of by universities , conferences and the @entity18 , making billions from games , while the players sometimes struggle with basic needs like medical care , concussion testing and guaranteed scholarships			1
@entity175 told @entity194 his organization has , for years , tried other strategies but failed			0
" everyone is entitled to opinions , but after a decade of advocacy , i 've tried every other way , " he said			0
" we 've begged , pleaded , pressured , changed laws			0
there is no other way to bring forward comprehensive reform , and just like other billion - dollar industries , the answer is a union			0
" @entity175 said he wo n't comment on whether other teams at other schools are now planning to follow in the steps of the @entity4 football players , but he did note that the @entity1 judge ruled in @entity38 's favor on every point they made			1
" this sets a precedent , " @entity175 said			0
" this ruling is going to apply to all private schools in ( @entity96 )			0
that 's a significant number of schools , a significant domino to fall where hundreds of thousands of players will have rights under labor law and that 's the first step in creating an environment where players are protected			2
" in march , the @entity171 took its fight before the @entity1 in @entity2 and presented a case during a five - day hearing			1
both sides recently submitted court briefs			0
@entity4 's appeal could go as far as the @entity237 @entity236 , and it could take years before there is a definitive decision			1
during his daylong testimony last week , @entity173 talked about year - round time requirements , at times 50 hours a week devoted to football			2
@entity173 said he had to give up his major related to pre-med studies because he could n't fit the classes into his schedule			1
the university countered that by bringing in students who were able to stay in rigorous classes , but @entity173 's sentiment was echoed by the @entity18 itself in a 2012 survey that asked athletes what they would change about their college experience			2
about 15 % of men 's football , baseball and basketball players said they would have had different majors had they not been athletes			2
twelve percent of @entity96 football players said athletics prevented them from majoring in what they wanted			1
the average time spent on athletics in - season hovered around 40 hours per week for all three sports , according to the survey			0
that flies in the face of the @entity18 20 - hour rule , which states that , no matter the sport , coaches ca n't take up more than 20 hours of their players ' time .			1

@entity18 " disappointed " in ruling , warns against dismantling student - athlete system
@entity1 rules in favor of @entity4 football players unionizing
school 's president emeritus has that if the players won , @entity4 may forgo football
@entity288 told board he had to give up pre-med major because of football
