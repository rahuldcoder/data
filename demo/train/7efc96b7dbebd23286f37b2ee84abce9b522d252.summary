-- the second @entity2 bombing suspect is in custody			1
now everyone will focus on what it all means , what " lesson " we can learn from the events			0
this is @entity12 's lesson : " no more hurting people			1
" @entity12 was one of three innocent bystanders to die on @entity15			1
as we debate issues of life and death in our state legislatures and @entity20 , we need to keep the picture of this boy and his sign not in our memories or @entity26 walls , but on display			1
the worldwide response to that picture -- which his teacher , @entity30 , said was made as part of a school lesson on the shooting of @entity35 -- has been both heart - stirring and heartbreaking			1
people are striving to remember and to honor , yes ; even more , though , they are trying to make his words real			1
everyone killed in the @entity2 bombing , and during the events that flowed from it , was under 30			1
@entity12 was 8 years old ; how will his classmates handle their grief ? @entity46 , age 29 , had moved to live with and help care for her ailing grandmother			1
doctors had told @entity46 's mother she had survived the blast , but they had mistaken @entity46 's friend for @entity46			0
what must her mother and grandmother feel ? @entity57 was a 23 - year - old graduate student , the only child of her parents in @entity59 , who said learning of her death was " a dagger in our hearts			1
" @entity65 , 26 , was shot multiple times while in his cruiser without drawing his gun			1
he had been a campus policeman with the @entity69 for only a little over a year , and volunteered at the gym where one suspect trained as a boxer			2
three days after the bombing of the @entity75 , the @entity73 defeated a bipartisan proposal aimed at curbing gun violence ; it would have required more widespread background checks for gun purchasers , something 90 % of @entity81 want			1
as a result of the bombing , immigration reform may soon become another political pingpong ball in the dysfunctional @entity73			0
every pundit and every politician feels every bit of bombast is justified			0
and the children ? pictures and comments , memorials on @entity26			0
" no more hurting people			1
" the injured : @entity35 's father and older brother , @entity99 , escaped injury			0
his 6 - year - old sister , @entity101 , lost a leg			1
@entity35 's mother , @entity103 , 43 , had brain surgery for a serious injury			0
the father , @entity106 , 42 , returned home briefly from the hospital to get clothing , and a neighbor said he was pale , almost dazed , and too grief - stricken to talk			2
the sidewalk in front of their house is still covered with colored chalk drawings of butterflies , flowers , and stars that @entity12 and his sister had drawn before leaving for the marathon			2
@entity121 , a former state senator , told the @entity122 that the @entity123 are " pillars of the community ... a model family , who somehow always found the time to give something back			0
" " any tragedy of this sort is extraordinarily difficult , but when you know people , when it 's people in your life , in your school , that 's when it really hits home , " the @entity122 quoted a classmate of @entity35 's , @entity140 , 9 , who said about @entity141 : " if somebody was left out , he would come say , ' want to join my group ? ' he sticks up for kids			2
" " it should not have happened to him , " @entity140 said to the @entity122			0
" it should not have happened to nobody			0
" as i read and hear these responses , i keep thinking , what are we -- the adults -- what are we telling the children ? do we think they do n't see the hollowness behind our hallowed words ? do we think they do n't know the difference between courage and cowardice ? there 's a @entity164 © : " @entity165 is the enemy of the good			0
" apparently , legislation must be perfect , because even after this horror , we are still finding ways to divide people			2
should suspect @entity172 be treated as an enemy combatant ? did the intelligence community pay little heed to the warning it received ? questions			0
but let us pause to bury our dead and stand by the wounded as their struggle with the new reality of their lives			0
some will have to learn how to simply stand up again -- wounded forever			0
we should hold @entity35 's sign in our hearts and resolve to do better			2
because , with president @entity194 , " i 'm assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words			0
" i , too , believe that , " sooner or later , we are going to get this right			0
the memories of those who died and many who are still suffering demand it			2
" " no more hurting people			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			1

8 - year - old @entity2 marathon *victim* had carried sign , " no more hurting people "
@entity205 says others who died were also under 30 and were innocent *victim*s of terror
during the same week , a bill to require background checks for more gun purchasers failed
@entity205 : will we continue to fail *victim*s of *senseless* violence ?
