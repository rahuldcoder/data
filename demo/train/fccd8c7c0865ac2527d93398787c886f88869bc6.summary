the 2015 @entity0 offered the familiar -- a slew of awards for a newcomer , some outstanding performances -- and the unfamiliar : @entity7 laughing and smiling ? here are a few things that dominated the evening and ideas to make the show better : welcome , @entity11 ! a year ago , the @entity13 soul singer was an unknown in @entity15			1
sunday night , he took home four @entity0 , including song of the year , record of the year ( both for " @entity18 " ) , best new artist and best pop vocal album ( for " in the @entity22 " )			1
he also gave a dazzling performance of " @entity18 " with @entity24 pitching in			0
about the only thing that could have made it better was if @entity27 , who was credited on the song thanks to similarities to " @entity30 , " had joined him			1
" i 'm having a really , really , really good night , " @entity11 said as he won song of the year			1
is that @entity7 ? like dancing unicorns and functioning congresses , a smiling , laughing @entity7 was considered a mythical creature : occasionally talked about but never seen			1
on sunday night , though , the usually grim - faced rapper gave a soulful performance of " only one , " joined @entity39 and a somewhat awkward @entity40 for " @entity41 " and then jokingly stole the show by running on stage when @entity44 won album of the year for " @entity46			2
" on the other hand , maybe he was n't joking at all			0
@entity44 's big night obviously , @entity7 did n't expect @entity44 to win album of the year -- and neither did @entity44 himself			1
but " @entity46 " took home that major prize as well as best rock album			0
obviously flustered , @entity44 thanked the entire production team , as well as his children for " letting me keep them awake extra longer			0
" how did @entity44 beat out @entity55 ? pointed statements the @entity0 got in some issue - oriented statements president @entity58 dropped by via video to speak against domestic violence , with activist @entity61 giving a moving speech			1
others were n't even spoken aloud : during his performance of " happy , " @entity64 and his background performers held up their hands in the now - familiar " do n't shoot " move			0
grammys 2015 : race takes center stage and then there was @entity73 , who came out to present album of the year			2
" like books and black lives , albums still matter , " he said			0
@entity78 goes to church ; @entity80 goes to hell ; @entity82 goes looking for a place to hide @entity84 was doing a fine job with his " @entity86 to @entity87 , " but @entity78 gave the song a new dimension -- and then took the audience to church with her soulful , dramatic version of @entity94 ' @entity93 ' " @entity95			2
" then there was @entity80 , which started the show with " @entity98 " and " @entity99			0
" as surprising as it was to see the heavy - metal heroes on the @entity0 -- not usually known for a fondness for metal -- it was equally surprising to see a group of celebrities wearing devil horns in the group 's honor			1
and @entity82 , known for hiding her face , performed her song " chandelier " while facing a wall			2
@entity112 and @entity113 handled the dancing duties			0
@entity82 was even reclusive on the red carpet .			0

@entity11 wins four @entity0 , including song , record of the year
@entity7 creates another *kerfuffle*
