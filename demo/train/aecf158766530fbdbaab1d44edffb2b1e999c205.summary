@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 gov. @entity3 met with protesters overnight and defended his position to not amend his state 's controversial " stand your ground " law			1
" tonight , the protesters again asked that i call a special session of the legislature to repeal @entity0 's ' stand your ground ' law , " @entity3 said in a written statement			1
" i told them i agree with the @entity17 on @entity18 , which concurred with the law			0
" @entity3 issued a proclamation friday for a " statewide day of prayer for unity			1
" the proclamation calls @entity25 's death a tragedy , notes that " emotions are running high " and calls for @entity28 to show unity			1
earlier , @entity3 said that he mourns with @entity25 's parents , but that he stands by the findings of the task force , which consulted with citizens and experts			2
the protesters are students and members of @entity37 , an activist group that participates in civic engagement and promotes nonviolent social change			0
they walked into @entity3 's office wednesday , led by @entity41 , 9 , and asked to speak to the governor			1
after the protesters camped there for three days , @entity3 met with them overnight and told them he has not changed his position			0
the dream defenders say they will continue their sit - in until their demand is met			2
" we 'd like the repeal of ' stand your ground ' or some type of modification where we can hold people responsible to a level that humanity expects , where we do n't have 17 - year - olds getting gunned down with no justice for them and their families , " said the group 's legal and policy director , @entity49			1
a call for reforms on thursday , @entity0 officials joined state house democratic leader @entity65 in urging that reforms be made to the controversial law			1
one of those officials , @entity69 @entity68 , is refiling his legislation to change " stand your ground			0
" " we have a clear case that shows @entity74 has very troubling problems , and those problems are central to the well - being of @entity28 , " he said			1
though former neighborhood watch volunteer @entity80 's defense never cited " stand your ground " laws in its case , the jury was instructed to consider them during deliberations			1
the jury acquitted @entity80 of all charges saturday in the 2012 shooting death of @entity25 , an unarmed 17 - year - old			2
@entity89 says he 'll boycott ' stand your ground ' states the @entity0 version of the law states , " a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force , including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony			1
" eight other states have laws worded similarly , while 22 total states , including @entity0 , have laws stating that residents have no " duty " to retreat from a would - be attacker , according to the @entity118			1
civil rights groups attack the laws as racially motivated and are planning nationwide demonstrations			2
@entity89 is refusing to perform in any state with such a law			0
@entity127 attorney general @entity126 said the laws " try to fix something that was never broken " and now encourage " violent situations to escalate in public			2
" but just as adamantly as the laws are decried , the @entity132 has stood by the measures it helped many states adopt. " the attorney general fails to understand that self - defense is not a concept ; it 's a fundamental human right , " said @entity136 , executive director of the @entity132 's @entity137			1
" to send a message that legitimate self - defense is to blame is unconscionable			1
" what are the chances of repeal ? as for those @entity148 at the @entity0 governor 's office , their protest may be futile			1
@entity3 's office noted that the gubernatorial task force recommends the law stay in place , though with minor tweaks , including limiting neighborhood watches to observing and reporting			2
@entity158 , director of the @entity159 , said he doubts the protests will change anything			0
overturning laws is n't incredibly common already , and with " stand your ground , " there are complicating factors			2
the @entity132 is strong in the 22 states that have the laws , and " i think there is some popular appeal to the notion , the very general notion , that citizens should be able to protect themselves and you should n't have to , in essence , run from crime			1
" also , the laws are relatively new , most of them enacted in the past eight years , and it 's unlikely the same legislators who put " stand your ground " laws on the books would suddenly be inclined to think they were wrong			1
" the more common response is , they 're going to dig their heels , " he said			0
as a parallel , @entity158 offered the " draconian " drug sentencing laws of the 1980s , which hugely expanded incarceration rates , were outrageously expensive and did little to improve public safety			2
yet , the country is only now examining those laws and considering their repeal			2
" i assume , in part , that 's because the people who passed them are no longer there , " @entity158 said			2
the trickiest factor , however , is that proponents and opponents of " stand your ground " can find in the @entity80 case assertions to support their beliefs , he said			0
one side believes @entity25 attacked @entity80 , and @entity80 had no choice but to fire his weapon to defend himself			0
the other side believes @entity80 racially profiled @entity25 , followed him against a dispatcher 's order and then shot a teen who was only reacting , perhaps out of fear , to being followed			2
" you can find whatever you want to back your assumptions , " @entity158 said			0
putting on his gun policy expert hat , @entity158 said he felt the laws are a " very bad idea , " and they do n't do what they were intended to do : deter criminals and protect the citizenry			1
doubts about ' stand your ground ' after @entity0 expanded its " @entity227 " laws to a " stand your ground " provision in 2005 , the @entity228 released a report			1
it said a " diminished sense of public safety " after 9/11 , a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system 's ability to protect victims , a perception that due process trumps victims ' rights and a decrease in gun legislation spurred the creation of " stand your ground " laws			1
the study cited concerns from law enforcement officials , including doubts that it would deter criminals			0
" there must be appreciation among the would - be criminals that deadly force can be used against them , leading to a change in criminal behavior , " the study said			0
" unfortunately , attendees at the @entity228 symposium expressed little confidence that criminals would take the provisions of the @entity227 into consideration before committing a crime			0
" @entity158 pointed to a @entity267 study examining crime in more than 20 states that passed @entity227 or " stand your ground " laws from 2000 to 2010			1
researchers found that not only was there no decrease in robbery , burglary and aggravated assault , but there was an 8 % spike in reported murders and non-negligent manslaughter			0
" the data are pretty compelling , showing that it increased justifiable homicides , and it increased homicides overall , " @entity158 said			0
" in all likelihood , it really led to more altercations similar to the @entity291 exchange			0
" additional protests this weekend the @entity80 verdict has been met by strong reactions			0
a national " @entity295 " day is slated for saturday in 100 cities , led by the rev. @entity297			0
the protesters will call for federal civil rights charges against @entity80			0
the rallies will take place outside of federal court buildings in cities across the country , including @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307			0
@entity2 's @entity308 in @entity1 and @entity309 in @entity310 contributed to this report , as did @entity313 's @entity312 .			0
