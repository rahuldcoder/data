@entity0 , @entity1 -- this @entity4 city already known for cigars , furniture , chocolate and coffee may become a magnet for @entity10 seeking controversial stem cell therapy for life - threatening illnesses if a @entity14 cardiologist has his way			1
dr. @entity16 , a @entity14 cardiologist , says he 's had success with stem - cell therapy in the @entity1			1
the @entity18 has not approved this stem cell therapy in the @entity10 because no clinical trials to prove its effectiveness have been done			1
but dr. @entity16 says his company , @entity22 , has successfully used adult stem cells to treat patients with heart and lung disease			1
@entity16 said he and his associates draw blood from a patient in @entity14 and then send it to a laboratory in @entity31 that produces what his company calls " regenocytes			1
" the company defines regenocyte as " a stem cell that has been activated to become a target organ			1
" " these procedures work , " he told @entity2 , standing inside a hospital room at the @entity41 in @entity42			0
" and it 's substantiated by objective data that we are collecting			2
" but @entity16 ' procedures have not been reviewed by other researchers , and leading scientists involved in @entity10 stem cell research efforts say @entity16 is simply wrong			1
dr. @entity50 , president - elect of the @entity51 , told @entity2 , " there is no such cell			2
there is nothing called a ' regenocyte			2
' " " as a stem cell scientist who works in the field of regenerative stem cells , i am disappointed and shocked that somebody would prey on a family that has an untreatable disease with the promise of a therapy that has no scientific or medical basis , " @entity50 said			1
@entity16 has a busy practice in @entity68 , @entity14 , outside @entity69 , and runs a company that promotes and administers stem cell therapies in @entity42 , a noisy , crowded industrial city in the central @entity1			1
he told @entity2 that in the past 18 months , about 100 patients have received adult stem cell therapy at a @entity1 hospital			1
most of them have been patients with severe heart disease , while the rest have suffered from chronic lung illnesses , he said			0
he said the @entity31 laboratories can produce between 40 million and 80 million stem cells from a patient 's blood sample			1
" then they also activate them and educate them to become the end organ to any tissues we are looking to regenerate , " @entity16 said			0
@entity16 said he makes no promise of results to his patients			0
he is collecting data from his procedures and has been in contact with a @entity14 hospital to independently review his findings , but that has n't happened yet , he said			2
he said he wants to present his data to the @entity18 by the end of 2009 , then ask the federal agency to accelerate its approval process			0
but @entity50 said the @entity18 will not accept data from a physician if the doctor has a financial interest in the outcome			0
" it is simply not done , " he said			0
@entity16 said he charges $ 64,500 -- none of it covered by insurance			0
he said the cost is driven by the expense of processing the stem cells , and providing clean rooms and couriers who hand - carry the cells to @entity31 and back			1
a year ago , @entity120 of @entity69 , @entity14 , paid @entity22 more than $ 54,000 for stem cell therapy in the @entity1 after suffering from chronic lung disease			1
she said she believes the therapy was worth the expense			0
" right away , the next morning , i felt a sense of well - being that i had n't felt in a long , long time , " @entity120 said			0
" i know that i am living proof that this does work , " she added			0
" @entity120 's family physician , dr. @entity130 , confirmed to @entity2 that she had been suffering for many years from an advanced state of @entity132 , an incurable lung disease			2
@entity130 told @entity2 he was " quite incredulous " after seeing her condition improve			0
the chief medical officer of the @entity135 , dr. @entity136 , said he does not doubt the sincerity of patients who believe they have been helped by stem cell therapy			1
but he added , " there 's an enormous placebo effect in almost all of these cases			0
" " i have looked for the scientific efficacy of this approach , and can find none , " @entity136 said			0
@entity130 , who said he has been @entity120 's family physician for many years , disputed any suggestion that her apparent recovery stemmed from a " placebo effect " -- an improvement sometimes seen in patients who are given an inert substance in clinical trials			2
" i know about the placebo effect , and her improvement does not seem to be a result of that , " he said			0
@entity16 said his patients " are getting better " under his treatment , but he has not yet applied for clinical trials in the @entity10 because of the high cost			0
he shrugs off the criticism from people who doubt his claims , saying he -- and not they -- are on medicine 's cutting edge			2
stem cell experts who reject his methods " need to be better educated , " he said .			1

@entity14 cardiologist is administering stem cell therapy in @entity1
he claims he 's had success in turning stem cells into cells from target organ
" there is no such cell " as a " regenocyte , " stem cell research expert says
therapy patient and her *longtime* physician say her improvement was *significant*
