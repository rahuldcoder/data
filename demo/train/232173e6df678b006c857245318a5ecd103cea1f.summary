-- winner of the week : the big chart story this week is rapper @entity3 , whose independent debut " @entity4 " sold 144,000 copies and hit @entity6 on the @entity8 album charts			1
but we 're more intrigued by the latest single action from @entity12 -- last friday , she put out the video for " @entity14 , " the sixth single from " @entity16 , " and it 's killer			1
@entity19 , in old - lady makeup , sits on her bed staring into space as she flashes back to the " younger " @entity19 in a goofy romance with actor @entity23			0
the whole thing ends tragically with the perfect closing : @entity27 singing " @entity29 " from his 2003 album " unearthed iii : redemption songs			0
" anyway , the video premiered on " the @entity32 " and has since hit more than 12.4 million views			1
what 's extraordinary is that even before that , radio was picking it up , boosting the single 38 spots up the @entity39 , from 63 to 25			2
look for this one to have serious longevity , given @entity19 's hit history this year and the video boost			2
loser of the week : @entity44			2
his " @entity46 " dropped from @entity6 to @entity45 this week , shedding 54 percent ( 97,000 total this week )			1
on the flip side , @entity53 's " @entity52 " surged from @entity48 to @entity49 , selling 123,000 copies and gaining 38 percent in sales			1
@entity53 is clearly on the verge of dominating @entity52 season			1
lucky for him , holiday albums are traditional sales phenomena , as opposed to downloads -- @entity53 is just @entity60 on this week 's @entity62 chart , and @entity44 did n't place at all			1
why ? our guess is that most people still have cd players in their living rooms , where they decorate trees and such , and probably have n't gotten around to syncing old - school hi - fis with @entity62 and @entity70			0
thus , holiday music is somewhat invulnerable to music piracy , which is why record companies love to release as much of it as possible during this time of year			0
as to why @entity53 and not @entity44 ? no idea			2
a hearty wobble dee wobble dee wop to you , too : and finally , a word about a * * * *			0
@entity89 rapper @entity88 's " dance ( a * * ) " is one of the most hilariously , gloriously cynical videos we 've seen in a long time -- it 's all bling , booze and scantily clad ladies , plus the word " a * * " repeated like a mantra and superimposed in various languages			2
the remix video contains a lengthy cameo from @entity92 , who gamely shakes her own you - know - what ( squeezed into @entity96 shorts , among other things ) and actually elevates the video for a few seconds with her bug - eyed power - rapping			0
it 's up to 10.5 million views on @entity103 and @entity39 ranks it number 14 , up from number 29 the previous week			1
we do n't expect it to hit bottom ( sorry ) soon			0
