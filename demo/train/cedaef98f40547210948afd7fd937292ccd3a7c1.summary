it takes dr @entity1 three hours to put on the spacesuit he hopes will , one day , walk across the surface of @entity4			1
it 's worth taking time when you 're wearing a suit made from roughly 10,000 parts , designed for the most treacherous environment yet to be encountered by a human being			2
groomer is the @entity13 astrobiologist responsible for building a spacesuit for the @entity4 explorers of tomorrow -- and he 's taking inspiration from armor worn by medieval knights			1
he explains that -- after the titanic effort required to get there -- simply surviving on the red planet will be a grueling battle			0
@entity4 : survival groomer paints a terrifying picture of an astronaut 's view over the @entity4 landscape : abrasive particles of glassy sand , whipped into dust - storms ( with wind speeds of 200kph/125mph ) ; galactic cosmic rays of radiation , with only the thinnest atmosphere to block it ; temperatures plummeting to minus 130 degrees @entity37			2
it 's an environment the enthusiastic scientist refers to -- without risking exaggeration -- as " fairly " hostile			0
@entity42 : a wearable spacecraft in a small research facility -- nestled among the @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity13 -- groomer 's team at the @entity49 are developing a suit to withstand the challenge			1
the result : a " spacecraft to wear			0
" the 45 kilogram suit incorporates air and power supplies , communication devices , sensors to take biometric readings , and ventilation -- plus all the facilities required to allow the astronaut to eat , drink and ( even ) scratch their nose while away from base			0
no contact it 's a robotic creation with all the life - supports systems of a conventional spacesuit but with added capabilities needed to operate all alone on a distant planet -- where fast communication with earth is impossible			0
there , the suit will have to double as companion , adviser and mission control to the astronaut			0
it 's 50 % software , says @entity1 : a built - in virtual assistant will be on hand to say " be careful you 're running out of oxygen " or " your next target is 2 kilometers away			2
" staying tough wearing the @entity88 - era suits sported by moonlanders , the @entity4 explorers would be " very dead , very soon " , @entity1 warns -- the suits being not nearly robust enough for the longer term missions they 'll be expected to undertake across @entity4 ' " totally unforgiving " landscape			1
the suits are designed to be repaired mid-mission but @entity1 says he 's also been looking to medieval armories for inspiration for the tough mars suits -- taking cues for the design of its upper torso from an armor suit he found recently			1
watch : see how @entity104 spacesuits are tested the smart suit @entity107 's main concern , though , is not toughness			2
he and his team are caught up in a @entity109 : developing suits in competition with @entity104 and @entity113 's @entity112 - 2 , @entity115 's @entity114 , and others			1
where the other teams ' suits are strongly focused on withstanding the physical strains of walking on @entity4 , @entity1 claims his team 's effort is the most intelligent : " the big difference in our suit is that we consider it as a central hub for an entire family of instruments , " meaning the wearer can keep control of a robotic explorer vehicle and all the devices and sensors to be housed at the @entity4 base station			1
it might sound impressive , but the word @entity1 keeps mentioning is " safety			0
" the complex computer systems are as much as he can do to keep the astronauts of the future safe , 380 million kilometers from home			0

watch ! @entity42 : the *prototype* spacesuit for @entity4 exploration
dr @entity1 has designed the suit to be the " smartest " suit yet
dr @entity1 's team at the @entity49 face competition from other suits
the *finished* suit will be a " spacecraft to wear , " says @entity1
