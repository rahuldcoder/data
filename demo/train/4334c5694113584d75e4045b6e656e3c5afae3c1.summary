-- @entity1 will launch a music service later this month , according to recent news coverage			1
details on the new platform are scarce , but @entity6 at @entity7 reports that @entity1 is partnering with top music services @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 to let users stream music on @entity1			1
for the uninitiated : @entity9 is a service that lets you listen to virtually any song for free on your desktop , with an occasional ( but infrequent ) ad			2
users can pay a small fee to remove the ads or use the service on their phones			0
that 's right -- @entity1 may be about to unleash unlimited free music to all its users			1
music is enjoyed almost universally , and free music services have been among the fastest - growing on the web -- @entity31 , to name but one			1
providing free music to more than 750 million people ( assuming @entity28 launches globally ) seems like a no - brainer : why would n't everyone in the world want to listen to and share free music with friends ? this is the web equivalent of giving away free ice cream			1
i 've been wrong on @entity1 so many times before			0
i was wrong on @entity41 , the social network 's challenger to location - based startups			0
" it 's inevitable that @entity1 will surpass @entity46 in the check - ins race , " i declared more than a year ago			2
while i ca n't verify that @entity41 did n't surpass @entity46 in terms of the check - ins it provided , @entity1 no longer feels that it 's viable as a stand - alone product : these location features are being merged into status updates and brand pages , the company announced recently			2
i was wrong , too , about @entity57			0
in my predictions for 2011 , i saw the service as a potential rival to market leader @entity61			0
after all , how could you provide a " 50 % off " coupon for a local business and not have a small percentage of @entity1 's massive user base accept ? wrong ! @entity57 is set to shut down in the coming weeks , with a few limited offers remaining on business pages			0
meanwhile , the daily deals space is coming under fire , and even @entity61 is drawing extensive criticism as it prepares for its ipo			0
how can @entity1 take something popular , provide it free of charge to its 750 million users , and yet fail to become the market leader ? perhaps the company simply is n't able to devote the resources required to nurture so many non-core products ? or perhaps @entity1 users are so focused on their news feeds that no product can take off unless it 's inserted into this stream from the start			1
? whatever the reason , one thing is clear : for @entity1 , simply putting a product in front of hundreds of millions of people is no guarantee of success			0
i find it hard to imagine a situation in which @entity1 users decide that free music is n't for them			1
virtually all of us enjoy music			0
if @entity1 ca n't make this work , then giving away " unlimited free money " might also prove a challenge			2
no , the biggest roadblock to @entity28 wo n't be the users ; it 'll be the record companies who , having already cut deals with @entity107 , decide to rescind the offer			1
another threat : @entity9 and its ilk may realize that giving away free music to millions of people is n't the most sustainable of business models			1
or maybe i 'm wrong again : perhaps @entity1 will fail to convince us that free ice cream is delicious			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity119 .			0

@entity1 is partnering with top music services @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11
free music services have been among the fastest - growing on the web
biggest roadblock to @entity28 wo n't be users , it 'll be record companies
