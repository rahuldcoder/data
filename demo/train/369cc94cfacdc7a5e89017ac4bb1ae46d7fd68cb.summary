" now , the government might deny these things			0
they might frame it in certain ways , and say , oh , well , you know , he 's a low - level analyst			0

" i 've worked for the @entity6 , undercover , overseas			0
and i 've worked for the @entity129 as a lecturer at the @entity131 , where i developed sources and methods for keeping our information and people secure in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world			0
