@entity0 -- @entity5 prime minister @entity4 is amassing dictatorial power as @entity8 troops leave the country , risking a new civil war and the breakup of the nation , his deputy warned tuesday			1
deputy prime minister @entity13 told @entity1 that he was " shocked " to hear @entity8 president @entity14 greet @entity4 at the @entity15 on monday as " the elected leader of a sovereign , self - reliant and democratic @entity5			1
" he said @entity17 is leaving @entity5 " with a dictator " who has ignored a power - sharing agreement , kept control of the country 's security forces and rounded up hundreds of people in recent weeks			1
" @entity8 left @entity5 with almost no infrastructure			1
the political process is going in a very wrong direction , going toward a dictatorship , " he said			0
" people are not going to accept that , and most likely they are going to ask for the division of the country			0
and this is going to be a disaster			0
dividing the country is n't going to be smooth , because dividing the country is going to be a war before that and a war after that			0
" neighboring @entity41 views @entity4 as its man in @entity0 and has dictated the shape of the current government , @entity13 said			1
but he said @entity4 is playing games with both @entity17 and @entity46			1
" there will be a day whereby the @entity8 will realize that they were deceived by @entity4 ... and they will regret that , " he said			1
the last @entity8 troops are scheduled to be out of @entity5 by the end of december , nearly nine years after the 2003 invasion that topped @entity52			2
more than 4,000 @entity8 and an estimated 115,000 @entity5 died in the invasion and the years of insurgency and sectarian warfare that followed			2
@entity4 won a second term as prime minister in 2010 after a months - long dispute among the leading parties in the country 's parliamentary elections			2
@entity64 's largely secular @entity63 movement won two more seats than @entity4 's party , but a merger of the premier 's @entity69 slate with a smaller @entity69 bloc put him first in line to form a government			2
the standoff raised fears of renewed bloodshed between @entity5 's majority @entity69 and minority @entity79 populations and prompted @entity8 officials to work out a power - sharing agreement , bringing @entity13 's @entity63 movement into the government			1
but @entity13 -- a @entity79 who was originally barred from running because of allegations that he supported @entity52 's @entity86 -- said he has no authority			2
he said @entity4 has flouted the deal 's provisions by refusing to name permanent ministers to lead the defense and interior ministries , which concentrates control over the military and police in the prime minister 's hands			0
but quitting the government carries the risk of being branded as terrorists and arrested , he said			0
" we are in a real problem now , " he said			0
" if we pull out of the government , he will be left to do what he wants to do , with us and with the others			0
" he said @entity8 officials , who brokered the power - sharing deal , either " do n't know anything in @entity5 and they do n't know what is happening in @entity5 , or because they do n't want to admit the reality in @entity5 , the failure in @entity5 , the failure of this political process that they set in @entity5			0

@entity5 is " going toward a dictatorship " under @entity4 , his deputy says
" this is going to be a disaster , " @entity13 says
he said he was " shocked " to hear @entity4 *praised* in @entity17
