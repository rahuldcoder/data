there 's one thing that even the traveler who can afford to go anywhere ca n't buy : time			2
rest assured , if they could , our nation 's wealthy would slip through history in nuclear - powered deloreans , splashing time - space mud upon the rest of us present - bound plebes as they zoomed past			1
to help them out ( all of us , really ) , we 've identified the next best thing : a roundup of destinations -- from bucolic to bourgeois -- that will make you forget what era you 're in			2
@entity21 ( @entity22 ) @entity22 is like an accordion of time , with every period folded over onto itself , forming a single wild note			0
this sound can be heard loudest in the @entity28			0
no hotel captures the rich , rhythmic history of the city like @entity21			0
built in 1886 , the @entity33 high - rise transports you to the early city 's heyday as soon as you enter its majestic white marble - covered lobby			1
done up in elegant style , author suites are named after favorite former guests @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			0
a visit to the @entity46 is practically mandatory			0
the bar has been revolving for 64 years and specializes in the @entity48 -- a mixture of @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , rye whiskey , cognac and dry vermouth that was reportedly invented by one of the @entity21 bartenders as patrons spun around him			0
@entity21 , 214 royal st. , @entity22 ; +1 504 523 3341 ; rooms from $ 170 the @entity60 ( @entity61 / @entity62 ) constructed with @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 influences , the @entity60 in @entity61 - @entity62 is a towering , opulent castle rising from @entity70 's tropical terrain			1
during its prime , the @entity60 was a favorite of the @entity73 , the @entity74 , mobsters , celebs and @entity78 dignitaries			0
while you can no longer see weekly synchronized swimming and alligator wrestling , take swimming lessons from @entity84 ( before he was @entity85 ) or dance to oversized jazz orchestras , there are still plenty of old school luxuries			0
for instance , the @entity91 - designed golf course , originally constructed in 1925 , and afternoon tea while listening to classical guitarists			2
the @entity95 , 1200 @entity96 , @entity62 , @entity70 ; +1 835 311 6903 ; rooms from $ 209 @entity98 ( @entity99 , @entity100 ) built in 1912 , the @entity98 predates the city of @entity99 by two years			1
early on , the mediterranean - revival building hosted @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , and the star power carried on through the years			2
@entity107 spent six of her eight honeymoons at the @entity110			1
from the ' 40s - era @entity113 counter and pink stools of the @entity115 to the canopied beds to the white - and - forest - green - striped @entity117 , it 's easy to forget which war is on			1
@entity98 , 9641 @entity120 , @entity99 , @entity100 ; +1 310 276 2251 ; rooms from $ 492 @entity122 ( @entity123 , @entity100 ) the @entity124 was a midcentury - modern oasis designed by @entity127 protégé @entity126			1
the building was originally intended as the first of many that would constitute a new community in @entity123 -- the brainchild of film director @entity134 -- but the plan was abandoned and the motel became a destination for stars looking for a quick flutter away from the @entity140 , less than two hours west			0
the site soon went into disrepair , then endured a few lives of its own before an interior designer and furniture designer purchased , revitalized and renamed the motel			0
now @entity147 is an ode to its namesake			1
every inch keeps in tune with the architect 's philosophy , yet each room feels as fresh as if @entity126 gave the final ok just a few months ago			2
@entity147 , 67710 @entity155 st. , @entity123 , @entity100 ; +1 760 832 5288 ; closed july and august ; rooms from $ 225 @entity157 ( @entity158 , @entity159 ) if you 're hankering for a trip back in time , maybe the @entity160 suits your boots			1
about 30 miles southwest of @entity164 sits @entity157 , a former gold and silver mining village that 's been transformed into a rustic paradise with 12 cabins , a dance hall and an open - air chapel			1
the " town " draws guests who want to leave cell phone service behind and relax in the natural hot springs			0
though visitors are surrounded by nothing but nature , they 're far from roughing it -- each cabin has been restored with elegance and comfort that could n't have been imagined by early settlers , even if they 'd struck it rich			0
@entity157 , 52068 road 38 , @entity184 , @entity159 ; +1 970 882 4800 ; from $ 600 @entity185 ( @entity186 , @entity187 ) to get back to an age when carriages shared the roads with pedestrians and bicycles , you need to visit @entity186 , where you can stay at the aptly named @entity185			1
opened in 1887 , the massive @entity195 - style hotel has remained largely unchanged since the early years when @entity197 agents held demonstrations and @entity199 lectured in the casino			2
cars were allowed for about three decades , but the citywide ban on them began in 1930			0
perhaps the hotel 's grandest distinction is its porch : at 660 feet it 's said to be the longest in the world			1
guests can walk the entire length or sit in one of dozens of white rocking chairs and look out over @entity213			0
@entity185 , 286 @entity214 , @entity186 , @entity187 ; +1 800 334 7263 ; rooms from $ 139 @entity216 ( @entity217 ) you can almost feel the jazz radiating from the walls of this historic @entity222 @entity221 haunt			1
@entity224 's most famous partier loved the @entity216 so much , he made it a setting in his greatest work , " @entity227			1
" the hotel has n't shied away from the honor			0
they 've even gone so far as to create a @entity231			1
if you prefer a room unburdened by photos of @entity236 and @entity237 , there are other vintage options available			0
whether you 're staying at the hotel or not , a night in any of the hotel 's dining and drinking venues might make you feel like you could run into @entity243 at any moment			2
@entity216 , 768 fifth ave. , @entity217 ; +1 212 759 3000 ; rooms from $ 533 @entity246 ( @entity247 , @entity248 ) for more than a century , nature lovers have been staying at the largest log hotel in the world , overlooking @entity253 's favorite ( and most punctual ) wonder			1
the colossal rustic lodge is just as impressive as it was when it opened in 1904 , and probably just as crowded , so do n't expect much intimacy or peace during peak hours			0
there 's also the matter of a tacky tourist shop and mediocre food			2
but where else can you stand on a terrace with a cocktail , watching moose grazing below , as boiling water shoots 185 feet up from the earth in the distance ? @entity246 , 1 @entity271 , @entity247 , @entity248 ; +1 866 439 7375 ; rooms from $ 103			2

@entity107 spent six of her eight honeymoons at the @entity98
@entity100 's @entity147 is a midcentury - modern *masterpiece*
@entity185 on @entity186 , @entity187 , is said to have longest porch in the world : 660 feet
@entity217 's @entity216 's art deco @entity231 honors the writer and his era
