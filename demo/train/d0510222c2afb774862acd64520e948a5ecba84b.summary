the man expected to become @entity2 's next prime minister wo n't pound the bully pulpit like @entity4			1
he wo n't claim to be the @entity5 of politics , or praise @entity8 's " tan " , and it 's highly unlikely you 'll bump into him at an all - night bunga bunga party			1
no , @entity15 is seen as a safe pair of hands -- and now , after a lifetime in politics , the 61 - year - old leader of the center - left @entity13 is hoping to hang on to a lead in the polls that bombastic three - time former premier @entity4 had all but wiped out in the dying days of the campaign			1
a cigar - puffing ex-communist and pillar of the @entity2 left , @entity15 campaigned on the promise of " a @entity27 " -- but as he knows , it will take far more than words to fix @entity31 's fourth - largest economy			1
@entity2 in crisis from top to bottom , @entity2 is a mess			0
@entity4 , its last elected prime minister , quit in disgrace in 2011 and is now on trial for allegedly paying for sex with an underage girl			0
@entity2 has the third highest debt - to - gdp ratio in the first world , and only @entity43 and @entity44 grew less from 2000 to 2010			0
@entity2 ranks 72nd in corruption -- behind @entity47 and @entity48 -- and at an estimated € 140 billion euros in yearly turnover , organized crime is the country 's biggest industry , according to one business association report			0
@entity2 ranks a woeful 73rd in the @entity54 , 80th in gender equality , and income equality is growing			0
@entity57 , who was appointed to run the country after @entity4 's departure , has forced through a bitter package of cost - cutting measures to save the country from financial ruin , snuffing out any hope of short - term growth			1
@entity2 's economy has shrunk for a staggering six straight quarters , and its 11.2 % unemployment rate is the highest since they began keeping records in 1999			0
and while @entity57 may have some say in the new @entity2 government , it is career politician @entity15 who will bear the burden of pulling @entity2 out of the mire			1
from school teacher to party leader @entity15 was born in @entity78 , a village in northwest @entity2 , in 1951			1
the son of a mechanic , he studied philosophy and wrote his thesis on pope @entity83 at @entity84 , according to his campaign website			0
the lifelong @entity86 has been married to @entity87 since 1980 and has two daughters			0
@entity15 abandoned a brief stint as a schoolteacher in favor of local politics , joining the @entity93 in the historically left - leaning region of @entity95			1
the @entity93 folded at the end of the @entity97 but @entity15 continued his way up the ranks in the leftist parties that followed , becoming the president of the @entity95 regional council in 1993			2
@entity15 served in cabinet for three center - left governments between 1996 and 2008 , most recently as the minister of economic development , when in a break with his communist roots he embarked on a series of free market reforms aimed at making @entity2 industry more competitive			1
last december , voters in his @entity13 had the opportunity to choose a younger , more vibrant politician to carry the torch for the @entity2 left in the upcoming election in the form of @entity119 , the brash 38 - year - old mayor of @entity120			2
but while @entity119 's following is growing , he was seen as too much of a modernizer for an @entity2 left long dominated by ex-communists , according to @entity124 , an @entity126 senior lecturer and expert on @entity2 politics			0
" @entity119 is seen as a @entity131 , but it 's never been a @entity131 left in @entity2 , and i do n't think he was trusted by some of the party faithful , " @entity129 told @entity130			0
@entity15 , the popular party veteran , trounced @entity119 in the primary by almost 22 points			0
but his nomination might also say as much about @entity2 's current political climate as it does about the candidates			0
" after years of @entity4 , voters need a rest , " says @entity140 , an @entity2 journalist who spoke to @entity130 during an 11 - day train journey across the country to gauge voters ' moods ahead of the election			1
" @entity2 are nervous , anxious and exhausted , the mood is the same everywhere			0
after so long on the roller coaster people want a safe pair of hands , and @entity15 is banking on that			1
" a more just @entity2 ? if elected , @entity15 has pledged to continue with @entity57 's unpopular budget - cutting reforms and sees them as a necessary evil , but he says @entity31 's strict focus on austerity measures is preventing @entity2 from growing			1
" the rigor and credibility that @entity57 has brought into the world are for us a point of no return , " he told @entity130 , several weeks before the election			2
" [ but ] we believe that a stimulus is necessary to the @entity31 and the @entity2 economy			0
" @entity15 will also pursue civil unions for gay people , immigration reform , and € 500 million worth of government - funded university scholarships , according to the @entity13 website			2
he says he will retain an unpopular property tax that his rival @entity4 has promised to repeal , and refund , in its entirety -- a promise @entity57 called " a poison meatball , " according to the @entity178			0
one of @entity15 's main goals will be to enact labor reforms to make it cheaper for businesses to hire , but experts say his allegiance to @entity2 's labor unions could complicate any attempts at change			2
" @entity2 has a lot of protected industries and interests , and @entity15 has a lot of ties to @entity193 , @entity2 's largest labor union , " said @entity126 's @entity124			2
" he is somebody from the old school left , and it 's unlikely he 's going to take a strong fight to the unions			0
" can @entity15 govern ? according to @entity129 , winning the election is just the beginning of @entity15 's problems			1
even if @entity15 wins the election , recent polls have him falling well short of a majority of the vote			2
most experts believe in order to govern he will need to try to cobble together a coalition with the more centrist @entity57 , whose austerity measures are deeply unpopular with factions of @entity15 's current alliance			1
and even if @entity15 and @entity57 manage to strike a deal , @entity4 could get enough votes to make life difficult for the coalition once it 's in office			1
his return to power may be unlikely , but the fact @entity4 looms large in the election -- just 15 months after resigning as @entity2 hit rock bottom -- is a testament not only to his domination of @entity2 politics over the past 20 years , but also to the left 's inability to capitalize on his scandals , according to @entity129			1
" there 's a lot of pessimism about the next government , and the problem @entity15 's got has been the failure of the left to deal with @entity4 , " @entity129 said			2
" they 're all sort of living in his shadow			0
" @entity2 has had more than 60 governments since @entity236 , and desperately needs a stable government to nurse its battered economy back to health			0
but while @entity15 has sold voters on his promise of " politics that tell the truth , " the truth is that the election may only be the start of the battle for control of @entity2 's future -- and it 's hard to keep the man everyone calls " @entity4 " down for too long .			1
