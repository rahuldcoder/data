-- it 's hard for today 's generation to imagine watching tv in the 1960s -- there was no @entity6 or @entity7 ( or even vcr )			1
you watched what the networks put on and that was it			0
and oh yeah , there were only three channels			0
yet television made some groundbreaking advancements in this decade as we learned from this week 's episode of " the @entity20 , " and here are a few of them : 1			0
television becomes a political force by 1960 , most @entity27 households had a television , and that year 's @entity31 / @entity30 debate was the first televised presidential debate			1
for many @entity27 , it was their first introduction to @entity30			1
when @entity30 was approached about the idea of debating his political opponent on television , he agreed immediately			1
@entity30 was comfortable on - camera and sure he 'd win			1
@entity31 , however , began to sweat during the televised debate , and the @entity27 people began to doubt him			1
no one realized just how much tv mattered until after those 1960 debates			2
later that election season , @entity30 appeared as a guest on @entity47 's " the @entity46 " ; and when @entity31 ran for president again in 1968 , he made a brief appearance on the sketch comedy show " @entity51 " and uttered the show 's famous catchphrase , " sock it to me			1
" it was the first time a presidential candidate had appeared on a comedy show			0
for the rest of his life , @entity31 maintained that his appearance on " @entity51 " won him the 1968 election			1
so while tv arguably cost @entity31 the election once , it may very well have snagged him the election the second time around			1
if you enjoyed president @entity66 's appearances on " @entity67 " and @entity68 , you can thank @entity31			1

the rise of tv journalism before the @entity30 presidency , television was far behind print journalism in terms of sources audiences relied upon for news			1
but soon , people relied on tv news for the day 's headlines as well as information on @entity27 troops in @entity86 , particularly the numbers of those killed or wounded			1
when something major happened on tv , it affected the whole country at the same exact time			2
tv news was the polar opposite of entertainment tv			1
the civil rights era , the @entity30 assassination and the space race all unfolded on tv			1
as @entity99 stated , " @entity69 showed the @entity27 people to the @entity27 people			1
" during the @entity100 , 83 million @entity27 were glued to their television sets as 10,000 antiwar protesters outside the @entity103 chanted , " the whole world is watching ! the whole world is watching ! " over and over as police pushed the crowd off @entity103 's @entity107			1
@entity6 reaches a broader audience " the tv was the center of the house , " recalled @entity109 , one of the executive producers of @entity0 's " the @entity20 " series			1
" i do n't remember a time without tv			2
" remember , there were only three channels ( @entity116 , @entity47 and @entity117 ) during the decade , and usually only one tv set per household			2
there were no " for mature audiences only " warnings			0
the syrupy sitcoms of the 1950s made way for shows such as " the @entity127 " and " the @entity128			2
" these showcased more realistic situations , although there were still the same idealized versions of humanity as the previous decade			0
@entity134 has stated that he put the best parts of himself and the people in his life into the inhabitants of the fictional town of @entity140 to achieve a blend of emotional honesty and laughs			0
that blueprint served as the benchmark for sitcoms for decades to come			0
" @entity147 , " which aired from 1957 to 1963 , was the first show shot from the perspective of a child , bringing to life those universal embarrassing moments from childhood that kids were certain they 'd never overcome , such as bringing home a bad grade or approaching the object of one 's affection			0
related : archive of @entity0 's may 29th @entity161 with @entity162 that kid - centric model was later replicated in tv shows such as " @entity165 " and , more recently , " @entity166			1
" eventually , shows began blending that " reality " with fantasy , which led to copycats : " @entity171 " and " @entity172 , " " bewitched " and " @entity173 , " and " @entity174 " and " @entity175			2
the advent of the variety show during the ' 60s , there were 18 variety shows going on three networks ! it 's safe to say that television went " variety show crazy " for a while			1
sunday night at 8 meant @entity185 ; but @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 , to name a few , had eponymous variety - hour programs , too			2
@entity192 + @entity193 : why @entity194 could never happen today @entity195 was considered a man 's game at the time , but @entity189 broke down a lot of walls with her three - wall sketch show			2
she and her cast mates sang , danced and did pratfalls -- often breaking character and cracking one another up in the process			0
kind of a precursor to @entity210 's @entity209 sketch or most of @entity212 's snl sketches			0
@entity189 felt that if she was having fun , her audience would , too			0
from " the @entity20 : television @entity69 " episode : @entity189 's pratfalls 5			0
television begins to tackle serious issues through a fantasy / sci - fi lens , " @entity221 " creator @entity220 often told stories of racism and fascism			1
similarly , " @entity233 " addressed the notion of a time where social evolution has eradicated prejudice and mankind possesses no bias whatsoever			0
the space age series even featured @entity6 's first interracial kiss , in which capt. @entity236 tells @entity237 , a black woman , " where i come from , size , shape , or color makes no difference			2
" what you might not know about the 1964 @entity244 when @entity246 won the @entity247 for male lead in " @entity249 " in 1968 , he stated in his acceptance speech , " we need more people in this industry to ... let it be known to the bigots and the racists that they do n't count			0
" incidentally , race was a nonissue in " @entity249			0
" @entity246 and actor @entity259 , who was white , were equals in the series in which they played intelligence officers			0
@entity264 : there actually is a legit reason why @entity267 can " fly " the explanation : she weighs 90 pounds and the combination of her cornet and the wind lifts her			0
now if only someone could explain how @entity276 made all those nifty contraptions -- usually out of coconuts -- but could n't cobble together a ( coconut ) raft to get the gang off " @entity282			0

shows , like " @entity221 , " tackled hot - button issues like racism
