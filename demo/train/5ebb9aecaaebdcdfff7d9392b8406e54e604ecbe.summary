-- @entity2 2012 's defining singalong moment came late in the festival , which wrapped up last night in @entity4 , @entity5			2
it was at that tent shortly before 8 p.m. , when @entity9 power - pop sensation fun			1
hit the first chorus of their ubiquitous hit , " @entity10			1
" across the vicinity , it seemed like every single attendee -- from festivalgoers to vendors and event staffers -- was singing along to the rousing , undeniable anthem with the same life - affirming gusto as fun			1
's lead singer , @entity23			2
love or hate fun. , but do n't accuse the band of false advertising			0
they make light , radio - aspiring pop with no other objective than to elicit joy in their audience			1
in @entity34 , the band has the commanding frontman to lead them to stadium - sized success if they can keep cranking out hooks that hit as hard as " @entity10 " does			1
the endgame for cultivating that kind of classic pop canon can be found in the reunited @entity42			0
the band has a treasure trove of outright classics , and they performed what felt like all of them during their sunday afternoon set			2
" @entity49 , " " @entity50 , " " @entity51 , " " @entity52 , " " @entity53 , " even " @entity54 " -- you name it , they probably played it			0
while that was n't inherently surprising , what came as a bit of a shock was how fresh the band sounded -- even if its elder members did n't look the part -- both on their classics and on tunes from their recently released @entity69 , " @entity59			0
" @entity71 's presence is what makes this reunion so successful , but onstage he looked like the @entity74 , sitting idly behind a grand piano and taking the occasional vocal lead ; @entity77 , meanwhile , seemed to be the main beach boy behind the wheel			1
taken together with the afternoon 's balmy weather and the day - in - the - park vibe of festivalgoers knocking around beach balls and splaying out on towels , the group 's sublime set was just the thing for a lazy , hungover sunday			1
@entity2 drew its initial inspiration directly from the festivals that @entity91 threw in the 1990s , so it was only fitting that @entity91 closed out the main stage with a two - set show that embodied the spirit of the fest. they did jammed - out covers of @entity100 's " @entity99 " and the @entity101 's " @entity109 , " dropped a deep cut ( " @entity103 " ) for the first time since 2003 and nodded to the @entity5 environs with a rendition of the bluegrass standard " @entity108			1
" " every time we play here we get to play with people we admire , " said guitarist @entity110 , referencing the band 's only other proper appearance at @entity2 in 2009 , when they brought out @entity114			0
this time around , they invited @entity120 onstage to sing " @entity121			0
" it seemed like an odd pairing at first , but moments later @entity110 teased " @entity121 's " melody again on guitar , this time incorporating it into a jam out of " @entity128 " with a knowing wink to the crowd			0
as the band wrapped up their four - hour enterprise with a " @entity135 " encore , a fireworks show erupted behind the stage , putting a wrap on @entity138 at large			1
between the nights spent camping , the constant consumption of live music and the inevitable exhaustion , it really is tougher for musicians to make an impact at @entity2 on its final day			0
but those elements were no match for @entity149 , who held an early - arriving @entity151 crowd in the palm of his hand during his set of savage barn - burners , falsetto - crooned waltzing ballads and slow - grooving dirges			1
@entity159 's blood - and - guts guitar tone and solos crescendoed like cinematic dramas , and his rhythm section knew just when to get out of the way and lay into a deep - pocketed groove			2
with @entity159 's cool , effortlessly seductive charisma , blues - rock has a new star on its hands			2
@entity171 's music is well - matched for a mellow sunday afternoon , and the band delivered a main stage set that was just relaxed enough while still managing to capture the audience			1
fans sang along to favorites like " @entity177 " and " @entity178 , " and frontman @entity179 decided to capitalize on it by asking them to belt the line , " what might have been lost , " in unison during a jammy rendition of " the @entity186 ( @entity187 ) " -- the chorus grew louder and louder until it turned into outright screaming			2
" let 's see if we can crack open the sky or something , " said @entity179 , who got his wish when it actually did start drizzling			0
judging by the size of their crowd at that tent , @entity199 was one of the most underrated bands at @entity2 this year , just as they were at their festival debut in 2010			0
since then , the @entity204 rockers have nailed down their hooky , artful sound , like @entity207 as interpreted by the @entity208			0
@entity211 garage - folk crooner @entity210 and his backing band the @entity209 added some sonic tension to @entity214 with a spotty , early - evening set that peaked with highlights like the lazy , off - putting acoustic meditation " @entity220 " and a washed - out cover of @entity114 's " @entity219			1
" the festivities in @entity214 came to a close with a three - way indie - pop showdown between the @entity224 , @entity225 and the aforementioned fun			1
the @entity224 played the fest 's traditional indie - headliner sunday evening slot at which stage and came out with guns blazing , opening with the " @entity232 " favorite " @entity232 " and following it up with the blithe and bouncy " oh , @entity234 " gem " @entity235			1
" in other words , business as usual for the good - natured power - twee quintet			2
meanwhile at this tent , @entity225 had a sizable crowd of thousands enraptured in tunes both emotionally charged and affable , the presiding tones of the day			0
