-- a @entity2 bounty hunter says he will sue @entity3 and her defense attorney @entity4 for misleading him when he helped search for her young daughter @entity3			1
@entity8 said he is seeking $ 200,000			1
@entity9 said @entity11 's attorney allowed him to fly to @entity12 in 2008 and help search for @entity11 's then - missing 2 - year - old daughter			1
@entity11 left jail sunday after being acquitted of murder charges in connection with the death of her daughter			2
@entity9 says when he heard @entity4 's opening statement during @entity11 's murder trial he felt conned			1
" it turns out she knew where the child was all along , " @entity9 said			1
" they misled me , and it is definitely fraud			1
" at one point during the highly - publicized search for @entity3 , @entity9 offered a $ 25,000 reward for the girl 's return			1
he also says he spent $ 50,000 to bond out @entity11 when she was initially jailed			2
he said he also brought in people to help provide security			0
he said he talked to @entity11 on many occasions during that time and that she never said she knew where @entity3 was			1
" she told me the babysitter stole the baby , " @entity9 said			1
" they were both feeding us that line			0
and now we know it was never true			0
we lost a lot of money			0
" @entity9 says it may take a few weeks to get his lawsuit together			2
@entity51 , a @entity2 legal expert , told @entity0 affiliate @entity52 that @entity9 's lawsuit may have legal merit			1
but he may need to do some work to prove his case , @entity51 said			0
" @entity3 never testified at trial			1
so he needs to prove that she lied to him , " @entity51 told the affiliate			0
@entity4 can also claim that @entity9 made more money becoming part of the @entity3 story than it cost him to be part of the search , @entity51 said			1
when the lawsuit is filed , @entity9 may have to get in line behind the others seeking money from @entity11			1
@entity12 officials are asking that @entity11 repay the state for the enormous cost of investigating the case			0
in a motion filed earlier this month , the state called for a hearing so it can tally up costs and slap @entity11 with the bill			0
" the efforts and costs of the investigation were extensive and not immediately available and accordingly , the @entity12 respectfully requests this court to set a hearing within 60 days to determine total costs , " the motion says			0
the motion cites a @entity12 law that allows the state to fine defendants in criminal cases to recoup money spent			0
@entity93 , a firm that helped search for @entity11 's daughter , also wants its money back			1
the company said it used 4,200 searchers and spent $ 112,000 looking for @entity3 in @entity12 after the girl was reported missing in july 2008			1
@entity99 , the head of company , has said he is suing because he believes @entity3 never was missing			2
@entity11 also faces a lawsuit from a woman named @entity103			0
at the time of @entity3 's disappearance , @entity11 told family members and police that the little girl was with a nanny named @entity110			1
that account resulted in one of @entity11 's lying convictions			2
@entity11 also claimed @entity103 had kidnapped the toddler			0
authorities never found a nanny by that name who cared for @entity3			2
they did , however , find a woman named @entity110 , who denied ever meeting @entity11			0
@entity103 then filed the defamation lawsuit			0
the judge handling the defamation lawsuit set @entity11 's deposition for october 8			2
@entity0 's @entity125 contributed to this report			2
