@entity0 -- when the new names of @entity5 's elite political committee were announced thursday they did n't come as a surprise to one leading @entity5 expert			2
rather , they reinforced the sense of " a major opportunity lost			0
" " this party congress has sent a very clear signal that this leadership is politically conservative , " said @entity11 of the @entity12 , who predicted that the lineup would n't go down well with the @entity5 people who he said were looking for signs of political reform			1
" you can imagine the @entity5 public may start to express some dissatisfaction with the dominance of princelings ( sons of revolutionary leaders ) , with the elder and retired top leader @entity31 's interference in the process of succession , and also that two liberal leaders @entity34 and @entity36 are excluded in the new @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , " he said			1
as expected , the number of seats on the @entity37 shrank from nine members to seven and included the names at the top of many speculative lists : @entity44 ( president ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
" of these seven people , it 's really five - versus - two or maybe even six - versus - one because only two people are @entity56 , " @entity11 said			1
@entity56 are @entity58 members who rose through the ranks of the @entity60 and typically have ties to outgoing president @entity62			1
" one of the @entity56 members -- @entity50 -- is actually very close to @entity31			1
so this lack of balance will potentially be a serious problem in the months or years to come , " @entity11 added			1
@entity1 asked @entity11 for his immediate reaction to the lineup and the possible implications for @entity44 's term as @entity5 's new president			1
after months of mystery , new leaders revealed what do you make of the new lineup ? it is not a surprise but a disappointment			1
the disappointment is based on several reasons : first , apparently there was no intra-party multiple - candidate election for the @entity37 and its standing committee			1
they were still selected through the old way of " dark - box " manipulation by departing @entity37 members			1
also , it 's dominated by @entity31 's protégés , especially the so - called princelings			1
despite a profound sense of disappointment , i should say there are some positive things coming out of this leadership transition			1
one is that @entity62 stepped down as chairman of the @entity99 , making the succession more institutionalized and complete			1
by and large , this leadership transition is another orderly transition in @entity5 history			2
the leadership change follows the rules and norms of age limits , and the turnover rates in all leadership bodies are all very high : 64 % for the @entity110 , 77 % for the @entity111 , 68 % for the @entity112 , 71 % for the @entity37			1
the size change ( from nine to seven members of the @entity37 ) , including the elimination of the police czar and the propaganda czar , is a welcome development			2
these are all positives but , in my judgment , this leadership lineup does not generate an uplifting spirit for the nation ; i think this is a major opportunity lost			1
some leaders , particularly the @entity56 leaders , will be very unhappy			0
you need to give an explanation to the @entity5 public why @entity34 and @entity36 -- two strong advocates for political reform -- are out			0
opinion : why @entity5 's reforms have hit a wall why are they out ? the reason , in my view , @entity36 is out because he is seen by many conservative leaders as a threat			2
particularly as @entity36 's main political rival @entity142 is out , they do n't want him to be in -- previously @entity36 and @entity142 tended to balance each other in terms of power , influence and policy preference			2
in many ways , both are very outspoken , very courageous , very innovative in politics -- they reach out to the public for support -- so in a way , some conservatives are very scared			0
in my view , this group of seven leaders is very capable in economic and financial affairs , but politically they are quite conservative			0

the criticism may not be against him but rather against @entity31 , against the dominance of princelings			2
he needs to demonstrate that he can provide new hope and confidence for the public with new economic policies			0
he should do so relatively quickly			0
he ca n't wait too long because a large number of people are very unhappy with rampant official corruption and growing economic disparity			0
he needs to do a lot on the economic front , but i 'm a little bit concerned that because of the composition of the new @entity181 the political reform will be delayed			0
these leaders are not famous for political reform -- not like @entity34 and @entity36			0
how will @entity44 rule ? i think he will emphasize economic reform -- to make the middle class happy -- and to promote the private sector , to introduce more economic reform mechanisms , including banking reform and state - owned enterprise reform , basically with the goal to promote private sector development			0
some of his team members , like @entity51 , @entity49 and @entity52 , are all pretty capable in that regard			0
the problem is that economic reform needs serious political reform ; otherwise , it can not go too far because of the political bottleneck			0
this leadership lineup has sent a very clear signal that it is politically conservative			1
what can @entity46 bring as @entity47 ? in many ways , he 's surrounded by @entity31 's people who will tremendously restrain his power			1
there were previously a lot of people who wanted to block him from the premiership -- that failed			0
but now even in the state council , certainly in the standing committee , he 's quite alone			0
what does it say about the enduring influence of @entity31 ? the backlash against @entity31 will be overwhelming			2
yes , @entity31 's camp wins many seats in the @entity37 , but in the future they may pay a huge price for this " victory			1
" the public resentment will be very strong			0
these leaders are still selected by old - fashioned , behind the scenes deal - making and retired leaders ' influence , not really through an intra-party multiple - candidate election			0
that 's a big opportunity missed			0
that will undermine their legitimacy and credibility			0

to a certain extent his protégés also want to have him to help them , in a way			0
@entity31 is strong largely because his protégés are in important positions			2
people like @entity44 , @entity48 and @entity51 , they 're already well - positioned			0
why has @entity62 failed to be the type of leader who could win out against @entity31 's people in the @entity37 ? it 's still too early to give a well - grounded answer due to a lack of reliable information about what happened inside @entity250 ( @entity58 headquarters in @entity252 )			1
there are several possible reasons : one is , @entity62 wants to make a contrast between himself and @entity31			1
@entity31 stayed in power for two more years after the transition at the @entity258			2
but @entity62 wants to immediately give up that position			2
so it is an institutional improvement			0
secondly , his volunteering to give up that position makes @entity31 's activity to promote his protégés in the past few months very problematic			1
the balance in the @entity37 is broken , but the balance in the @entity37 and the @entity99 -- between the two camps -- largely stays intact			2
there are many of @entity62 's people in the central committee			1
consequently , this may create structural tensions between these very important leadership bodies			0
