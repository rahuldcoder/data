" it spoke to the courage and ability to endure and to overcome a painful experience in which @entity5 - @entity9 at the time of the war were dishonored and shunned by their own country			2
" it brings back a bittersweet experience in the sense that there was so much pain in terms of shame and humiliation associated with it , but the community was triumphant in overcoming adverse circumstances and building a future for subsequent generations , " she said			0
@entity122 , a board member of the @entity153 , a nonprofit restoring the @entity127 internment camp , said she and the group are making a documentary on @entity5 - @entity9 mothers and their children born in @entity127 , located on the @entity160			2
