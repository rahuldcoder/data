-- @entity1 is clarifying her feelings about working on @entity4 's " @entity3			1
" " honestly , i hated it , " she said during a @entity6 radio interview when asked about her time judging season 12 of the talent competition earlier this year along with @entity10 , @entity11 and — most infamously and contentiously — @entity13			2
so how much did she hate it ? " i was led to believe — i was the first person signed on , " @entity1 said ( video below )			1
" @entity16 forbid i look like i 'm saying something negative , but honestly i thought it was going to be a three - person panel			1
they gave me a nice dangling monetary moment			2
i was like , okay , @entity10 will be there , i 've known him forever			0
this is n't a big deal			0
but it was n't that			0
it was like going to work every day in hell with @entity32			0
she apparently really despised being on @entity3			1
as @entity1 laughed and covered her eyes at her last comment , the host asked , " really ? " and then @entity1 added : " nah , i 'm just playing			2
it did n't affect me that much			0
" oh , okay , she was pretty cool with it ? " i was disappointed , " she added - added			2
so she was disappointed then ? " i loved the contestants			1
and some of them were so good , and also really good people			0
" so dealing with the contestants — that part @entity1 liked ? " it was disappointing when they would — for political reasons — not put [ contestants ] through			1
and i 'm like , i 'm not going to sit here and do this			0
i would prefer to put this person in a studio and record a record with them			2
" " @entity3 " really hired @entity1 as a judge ? she ca n't even clearly state her own opinion — about her own opinion ! the singer just released a new single titled , ironically , " @entity58			1
" both @entity1 and @entity13 are off @entity3 for next season , which has @entity11 , @entity60 and @entity61 as judges and premieres on jan. 15			1
