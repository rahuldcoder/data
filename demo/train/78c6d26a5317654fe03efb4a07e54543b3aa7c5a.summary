-- when a 324 - pound @entity2 moved to @entity3 , she brought a bikini - clad mannequin along to inspire her to lose weight			1
now , as the first season of " @entity7 " unfolds on @entity8 , the mannequin in the 23 - year - old reality star 's bedroom is nothing more than a functional statement piece			1
doubling as a coat rack and guitar stand -- " it 's definitely not what it was when i first started , " @entity2 says			1
and @entity2 ' reality show , originally marketed as a weight loss / transformation series , has progressed right along with her			1
the pilot , which focused on @entity2 ' measurements and eating habits , gave way to less weight - fixated second and third episodes about a college graduate trying to make it in a new city			1
so why mention her weight at all ? failing to point out a plus - size character 's weight is like -- for lack of a better idiom -- ignoring the elephant in the room , one tv insider said			1
but once weight is discussed , storylines can unfold naturally , allowing viewers to get to know the person behind the plus - size label			1
that 's certainly been true for @entity45 's hit show " @entity48 , " which originally took heat for leaning on fat jokes			2
now , in its second season , the sitcom draws laughs with family and relationship humor			2
" weight is so visual , it will always be part of the conversation , " said @entity54 , the editor and founder of @entity56			1
" [ ' @entity7 ' ] is kind of breaking the mold			1
... executives will play the angle they know the best to see the interest			2
from that feedback , they 'll make the new ideas			0
" so is @entity65 evolving to be more accepting of the overweight ? it certainly appears that way			0
in addition to @entity2 ' show , " @entity48 " star @entity69 is enjoying quite the ride			1
@entity69 not only won an @entity73 for her tv role , but she also snagged the hearts of fans with turns in the hit film " bridesmaids " and a hosting gig on " @entity80			0
" she 's also sold a script to @entity83 and a pilot script to @entity45			0
not to mention her planned plus - size clothing line			0
@entity86 , executive producer for " @entity7 , " said working on the @entity89 native 's reality show reinforced the importance of approaching a series with an open mind			1
" the project evolved from where we began , " he said			0
" after we started digging into @entity7 , and learning more about her -- her interests and where her story was going -- there was a lot more to talk about than just weight loss			1
" " focusing on who [ @entity7 ] really is as a person became the natural thing to do , " @entity86 added			1
so , despite her tough personal trainer and waning insecurities , @entity2 is n't the " @entity108 " people predicted she would be			1
rather than letting weight dictate her every move , the series will begin focusing more on her transition into adulthood : exploring a new city , breaking into a cutthroat industry , meeting new people and growing up			1
" a strong segment of our audience is there right now , " @entity86 said of the network 's demographic			0
" she 's struggling to find her way with the same hopes and dreams all of us have			0
" sound familiar , @entity129 ? though it was n't the network 's intention to create a more down - to - earth version of " @entity134 , " @entity86 said , " people are picking up on it now and i totally get it			1
... it 's just a new way of showing a young woman trying to find her way , and trying to build a career in @entity3 , in a somewhat similar field			0
" one viewer who was originally turned off by the pilot episode is the @entity145 's @entity144			0
" she 's stuffing her face with fast food in the first five minutes , " @entity146 said			0
" those shots are more appropriate for [ a weight loss show ]			1
those shots do n't have a lot to do with fashion			2
" and to her defense , " @entity134 " was n't exactly rife with footage of @entity157 eating chicken nuggets outside the drive - thru			2
but , @entity146 said , plus - size tv characters wo n't always be associated with things like consuming copious amounts of fast food			2
" sometimes people do n't give the @entity172 public the benefit of the doubt , " @entity146 added , noting , there was a time when people did n't want to see men and women in the same bed			2
another new show , " @entity176 , " chronicles the lives of five plus - size women working in the fashion industry			0
it received mixed reviews when its first three episodes premiered on @entity183 in august and september			0
@entity184 was just one outlet to pose the question : " is celebrating obesity really empowering or just undermining our health ? " yet the show provides a more accurate portrayal of curvy women than most weight - loss shows , said @entity193 , a former plus - size model and editor of @entity196			2
" we 're going in the right direction with shows like [ ' settles ' ] and ' @entity176 , ' " @entity197 said			1
" plus - size women are just like everybody else , " she added			0
" they have sex ; they date ; they have friends ; they 're married			0
... the media portrays it as we 're living this horrible life			0
we do n't wear color ; we only go out amongst ourselves			2
" and @entity2 is happy to be part of the progression			1
" you ca n't let your weight stop you from living your life , " she said , adding , " i probably used to weigh myself every morning when i woke up			1
after awhile , i realized i was going to crazy town			0
this is not what it 's supposed to be about			0
it 's about personal growth and self - acceptance			2
" and that 's the message she hopes to convey on her show			0
" it 's important to be healthy , but i also want to be sane			0

despite her personal trainer and waning insecurities , @entity2 is n't a " @entity108 "
