-- here 's a roundup of five medical studies published this week that might give you new insights into your health , mind and body			1
remember , correlation is not causation -- so if a study finds a connection between two things , it does n't mean that one causes the other			2
extreme obesity shortens your life more than smoking journal : @entity21 it 's not going to come as a surprise that obesity shortens your life by contributing to heart disease , strokes , diabetes and other diseases			1
but how many years are lost ? researchers from the @entity31 compared normal weight smokers to extremely obese non-smokers			0
they found the smokers lived longer on average			0
healthy weight smokers lost about nine years of their lives			0
non-smoking adults who were extremely obese -- defined as having a @entity39 of 55 to 55.9 -- lost nearly 14 years on average			1
researchers analyzed 20 large studies , which included more than 9,500 extremely obese adults and more than 300,000 people with a normal @entity39			2
participants came from the @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			0
the findings , published tuesday in @entity21 , highlight the need to develop more effective ways to combat the growing public health problem of extreme obesity , the authors write			1
simple blood test may predict @entity56 's journal : @entity58 according to the @entity60 , 44 million people live with dementia worldwide			1
that number is expected to triple in just 35 years			0
@entity56 's is usually diagnosed when the disease has progressed			1
while there 's no cure , early detection could lead to early intervention , which may slow the disease			1
and a simple blood test could be the key , according new study published thursday in @entity58 , a journal of the @entity60			1
researchers used blood samples from 1,148 people			1
ten proteins in the blood were found to predict whether people with mild cognitive impairment would develop @entity56 's within a year			1
as promising this new test appears to be , the @entity60 says it is n't ready for the doctor 's office yet			1
" to give the findings credibility , they need to be replicated by other researchers in larger , more diverse populations			0
" over 55 ? you too can donate a kidney journal : @entity88 people in need of a kidney often wait years for a deceased donor match			1
another option is a live kidney donation			1
but many times potential live donors are excluded because of their age			2
it 's been thought that older live kidney donors have a higher risk of heart disease after donating their organ			1
that 's not true anymore , according to a new study in the @entity88			2
researchers matched 3,368 older donors with older healthy non-donors and followed them for nearly eight years			0
they found that kidney donors older than 55 are at no greater risk for death or cardiovascular disease than non-donors			1
combo approach may help smokers quit journal : @entity114 smokers looking to quit often use either a medication named @entity117 or nicotine patches , hoping it will help reduce withdrawal symptoms			0
but a combination of those two methods improves the odds you 'll quit smoking on the short term , according to a study published tuesday in the @entity114			2
the study was funded by the companies that make @entity117 and nicotine patches			0
researchers randomly assigned 446 smokers to either take @entity117 and a nicotine patch , or @entity117 plus a placebo patch			0
treatment continued for 14 weeks			0
twelve weeks later , 55 % of those who took both medications were still not smoking , compared to 41 % of those on @entity117 alone			1
after six months , the numbers were 49 % and 32.6 % respectively			0

do n't pressure your doctor after a concussion journal : neurology after a concussion , doctors often receive pressure from their young patients , families and coaches to give an athlete the " all - clear " as soon as possible			2
but that 's dangerous , says the @entity163			2

a new position statement published in the journal @entity153 on wednesday calls for doctors to only give an athlete the " all - clear " to play when medically ready			2
" physicians should be thoughtful about athletes going back to field after brain injury , " says neurologist dr. @entity172 , one of the study authors			0
doctors caring for athletes with sports - related concussions should have adequate training and experience and also educate patients and their families about the dangers of concussion , the authors conclude			2
