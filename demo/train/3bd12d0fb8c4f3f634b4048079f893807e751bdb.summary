-- surprise , mobility and the merciless treatment of opponents : the blueprint of the @entity6 in @entity7 and @entity8 as it has gobbled up territory in both @entity7 and @entity8 over the past few months			2
but as its adversaries regroup , @entity10 -- which now calls itself the @entity6 -- may begin to suffer setbacks on the battlefield , according to a new analysis of its capabilities and tactics			1
" as a defensive force , the @entity10 may struggle to hold terrain if it is attacked simultaneously at multiple points or if its auxiliary allies begin to defect , " says @entity17 , who has worked throughout @entity8 and is now a fellow at the @entity19			1
@entity24 says @entity10 has a deep bench of talented military planners , veterans of the @entity8 insurgency during the @entity29 occupation and of the group 's creation of a mini-state in @entity7			1
it has foreign jihadists who have fought in @entity34 and the @entity35			0
" yet the pace of the war against the @entity10 is accelerating , and the group 's ability to continually shape and control the conflict will be sorely tested , " @entity24 writes in the latest edition of @entity37 , published by the @entity38 at @entity39			1
military analysts say @entity10 ' success so far is largely due to the weakness of its opponents , as well as years of meticulous planning after @entity51 's " reboot " of the group in 2010			1
this war of attrition included a campaign to intimidate and assassinate senior members of the @entity8 security forces last year , a campaign @entity53 called the " @entity60			0
" @entity61 built a command structure designed to combine centralized control with execution at the local level			2
this was highly successful during 2012 - 13 when the group synchronized waves of car bombings in different locations across @entity8			0
it was in evidence at the weekend in @entity74 - controlled @entity73 , when a series of three car bombs and a roadside bomb killed at least 20 people			0
@entity10 has weaved this tactic into its current military campaign			1
earlier this month , a well - planned attack against the @entity74 town of @entity83 began with a suicide car bomb that killed more than 20 @entity85 , " a second tanker truck suicide device in the town center , followed by individual suicide - vest bombings on 12 checkpoints by fighters wearing @entity74 - style uniforms , " @entity17 says			0
these multiple suicide bombings instil fear and panic in civilians and military opponents alike			2
they are @entity10 ' " shock and awe " tactic , complemented by the agility and speed of @entity10 units			1
" the relative compactness of @entity8 , where good roads allow large swathes of the country to be traversed in a single day , gives an aggressive force strong ability to concentrate forces at a given point of attack , " says @entity24			2
there have been claims that @entity10 is using @entity29 - made @entity115 tanks and humvees seized from the @entity8 army			1
and sometimes heavy armor has made an important difference			0
@entity10 used a single @entity8 t - 55 tank of @entity122 vintage earlier this month to fend off an attempt to break the siege of @entity125			1
but pinpoint @entity29 airstrikes have already changed the local balance around the @entity128 and @entity129			0
knights told @entity0 : " though @entity10 have undoubtedly captured 200 - 300 humvees and will be able to keep them operational for many months before they require spare parts , other @entity29 - provided vehicles are present in very limited amounts			1
in part this is because they are complex to operate and maintain			0
very few were captured in good working order because the @entity8 themselves were having trouble keeping them running			0
" @entity24 says that there is no evidence that @entity10 fighters have been able to operate @entity115 -- nor @entity29 manufactured 155mm howitzers			1
it does have far more armored trucks with heavy machine guns than it did before june , allowing it to overrun lightly armed checkpoints			0
" but faced with @entity29 airpower or even the slowly recovering @entity8 and @entity74 security forces , such vehicles become death traps , " says @entity17 , citing the group 's losses at the @entity128			0
making resistance appear hopeless to potential opponents is a critical part of @entity10 ' strategy			1
a tribal revolt in @entity161 in @entity162 last month was met with sustained mortar fire that almost razed the town			0
those who wanted to re-enter @entity166 had to " repent			0
" " if local populations can not mount an effective resistance to @entity10 , then they likely will not attempt to do so , " says @entity167 at the @entity168			1
@entity10 may have as few as 15,000 fighters for a vast area stretching from northern @entity7 to the middle of @entity8			1
so deception is also critical to its success			2
on many occasions it has appeared to be launching an attack -- drawing defending forces toward it -- only to strike the place those forces have left			0
earlier this month , @entity10 hit @entity83 , after @entity183 had left the town to confront an @entity10 thrust at @entity186			1
the fact that it has relatively few fighters per square mile may explain why it prefers to depopulate some towns because of an " accentuated fear of local uprisings and informers , " says @entity24			0
that could be a double - edged sword , because living among civilians in densely populated places should offer the group some protection			0
but there is evidence that the @entity8 air force strikes even when civilians are present			0
" my sense from talking to people along the @entity10 front line is that the group welcomes being able to shuffle discretely around depopulated towns , " says @entity24			1
and airstrikes , unless limited and carefully targeted , might even end up helping @entity10			1
" airstrikes into the @entity213 heartland of @entity8 or @entity7 may exacerbate the sectarian conflict in the region by illustrating a passive or active alignment of the @entity29 with @entity217 in order to bring firepower to bear against @entity213 , " says @entity210			2
@entity10 has also traded on tribal rivalries to consolidate its position , " such as by plugging into the @entity223 sentiments of @entity225 tribes around @entity83 or allowing @entity225 tribes to harvest the ripe wheat fields of displaced @entity229 farmers at @entity125 , " says @entity24			1
these local arrangements may work for a time , but @entity10 is likely to encounter stiffer opposition			1
its use of surprise will be slowly devalued , as its tactics are studied -- and especially as the @entity235 and @entity183 begin to receive a flow of real - time intelligence from the @entity29 surveillance			0
@entity24 says he was told by @entity74 sources that @entity10 tried to infiltrate the town of @entity242 after dark two weeks ago			1
but its fighters were detected by the @entity29 military , which provided @entity74 artillery with the coordinates required to blunt the attacks			0
knights told @entity0 that " @entity29 special forces seem to be operating along the front line , visually checking and designating targets			0
@entity29 headquarters personnel at the joint operations center in @entity254 [ the capital of @entity255 ] are helping the @entity74 and the [ @entity8 ] air force to coordinate their actions and to avoid ' friendly fire '			0
" and then there is the weight of expectation among @entity10 supporters			1
its momentum has helped swell its ranks as both foreign fighters and young radicalized @entity8 @entity213 have flocked to join			2
but @entity53 's declaration of a @entity267 means @entity10 has to " demonstrate that its physical stronghold is defensible , or at least prevent rival militaries from attacking it , " says @entity210			2
@entity10 has shown a rudimentary ability to defend its gains , building berms , booby - trapping approach roads and destroying bridges			1
it has successfully ambushed @entity8 troops and @entity276 militia trying to retake @entity277			0
but defensive positions and predictable counterattacks leave its forces more exposed to airstrikes			0
" @entity10 ' defensive style has two components , " @entity17 told @entity0			2
" they use roadside bombs and vehicle - carried remotely detonated bombs to create explosive emplacement hazards along key routes and in key towns			0
the @entity29 has shown that , along with ground sources , it can remotely spot and destroy these from the air			0
" " @entity10 ' other key preference is for counterattacks , almost as an instinctive reaction to losing ground			2
this is an organization that much prefers to be on the attack , even tactically , as part of a defensive operation			0
but counterattacking @entity10 convoys are easy meat for @entity29 airpower and even for @entity8 aviators , " he adds			2
and if @entity10 has to do more defending than attacking -- as seems likely -- the @entity213 communities that have supported , accepted or acquiesced to it may think twice			2
" if the @entity235 and @entity74 forces undertake selective offensive operations on a widening number of battlefields , " @entity24 says , @entity10 and its allies " will undoubtedly become stretched , particularly if its ability to move and mass counterattacking forces is limited			1
" another vulnerability may be lines of communication between @entity316 in @entity7 , @entity10 ' administrative headquarters , and its units in @entity8			2
" snapping the @entity10 caliphate in half is a key objective , both to undermine the narrative of a transnational caliphate that can be defended , and to reduce the synergies of two insurgencies fighting back - to - back , " @entity17 told @entity0			2
for now , observers say @entity10 still has momentum , and repeatedly demonstrates its ability to fight on many fronts simultaneously , pacify or co-opt towns and villages that might otherwise resist and hold territory against the @entity235 , which have been weakened by several years of political interference and poor leadership			1
the idea that the @entity235 are capable of retaking @entity128 anytime soon seems far - fetched			0
better co-ordination among its opponents , and the psychological effect of going on the defensive , may begin to turn the tide			1
but to borrow a phrase from another conflict , most analysts believe we are not close to @entity345 in the battle against @entity10 , rather anticipating the end of the beginning .			1

@entity10 ' " ability to continually shape and control the conflict will be sorely tested , " analyst says
its success so far is largely due to the weakness of its opponents , analysts say
for now , observers say @entity10 still has momentum , but opponents can turn the tide
