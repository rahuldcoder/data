-- i spent a restless night , worrying that another man - made disaster might devastate my beloved hometown , @entity4 , just as its post-katrina motto " @entity5 " was becoming real			1
the oil spill could n't come at a worse time			1
everybody was so up , waiting for the inauguration of our newly elected mayor @entity11			0
the @entity14 oil spill threatens @entity4 and the entire @entity15 in a way that 's more insidious than @entity17			1
after all , the failure of the levees and the response from the previous administration , widely criticized for incompetence and indifference , followed an act of nature : the destruction , immediate ; the impact , obvious ; and the pain and suffering , visible to all			1
the @entity14 disaster has only one cause : human greed , and the almost inevitable result , negligence			1
the immediate tragedy was that 11 people died			0
but the destruction that will result from @entity14 's " crude river " will be long - term and the impact far from obvious			1
the " crude river " will spawn streams of suffering : economic , environmental and emotional			2
so as the " @entity44 " fights the " @entity45 , " how do we assess the players ? and what actions should be taken against rigged disasters , both once and future ? first , we must hold @entity14 accountable and responsible			1
was it an accident ? only if we define " accident " as negligence			2
the failure of the " shear ram , " the set of steel blades intended to slash through a pipe at the top of a well and close off the flow of crude , should not have surprised @entity14 or the corporations that work for it			1
eight years ago , the @entity64 found that 50 percent of the shear rams tested failed			1
so calling the failure of the " last resort device " an accident is like calling the damage caused by a drunken driver an accident			1
failure to take the proper precautions is not an accident ; it 's negligence			2
@entity14 has rightly accepted responsibility			1
we may grant the company a skeptical benefit of the doubt regarding its willingness to pay for the cleanup and the damages			0
we should , however , monitor its pr - to - payout ratio			2
but we should not lose sight of the role of companies like @entity88 , under investigation because it was responsible for the cement seal that apparently leaked ; @entity91 , which supplied the rig 's blowout prevention system ; or @entity94 , which manufactured the rig			2
as the federal government begins its investigation , it should ask not only who was negligent , but why			0
to what extent did profit preclude prudence ? since @entity14 ca n't contain the spill -- rather , the river , which is what it really is -- government at all levels must do what it 's supposed to do , and do it right			1
for example , officials should carry out @entity112 president @entity111 's plan to deploy local fishermen with booms on movable platforms in the @entity15 , ready to " draw a line in the sand , " depending on how the oil moves			2
already the response from the @entity122 administration exceeds that of the federal response to @entity17 , and the oil has n't yet begun to cause the catastrophic damage we all fear			1
the morning after the explosion , deputy secretary of the interior @entity129 was sent to the @entity15			0
the morning after the explosion , deputy secretary of the interior @entity129 was sent to the @entity15			0
president @entity122 began monitoring the situation , staying in contact with the governors of the five @entity15 , making sure every available resource be at their disposal and ordering a coordinated cabinet - level response			2
here are a few authorizations the president has made , before his personal visit			0
the @entity142 ; the @entity143 ; and the @entity144 immediately began directing and overseeing @entity14 's response			1
the @entity146 is using advanced technology and working with the @entity142 to contain and disperse the oil			0
the departments of @entity150 and @entity151 will be investigating the cause and inspecting all platforms and rigs in the @entity15			0
the secretary of defense is authorizing the @entity156 to help communities in the cleanup and to protect critical habitats from contamination			0
but @entity122 has to let people know what 's being done , what will be done , and that he takes this personally			0
he needs to express , perhaps as only he can , that the federal government gets it			0
he gets the plight of the fishermen , the restaurants , the waiters , the taxi drivers -- the economic ripple effect and the environmental tide of disaster			0
this is a visual and visceral crisis			0
if he handles it right , it will be known as a sign of @entity122 's competence			0
@entity122 ca n't split the sea , but he must help to plug the @entity15			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			1

@entity183 : oil spill comes as her hometown of @entity4 is on the mend
@entity183 : greed , negligence caused @entity14 oil spill , death toll ; suffering to be long - term
50 percent of " last resort devices " that did n't work this time failed in 2002 tests
besides @entity14 , she writes , companies behind failed device must come under *scrutiny*
