two years ago , an 8.9 - magnitude earthquake generated a tsunami of historic proportions that waylaid @entity4 's northeast coastline , including a nuclear power plant			1
as @entity7 unraveled in global public view with fire , explosions and radioactive emissions for weeks , people living nearby were exposed to radiation and trauma			1
the trauma was worse , the @entity14 said in a report released thursday on the health effects of the " @entity18 and @entity19			1
" the lifetime risk of contracting certain types of cancer rose slightly for a small group of people because they were exposed to radiation from the nuclear disaster , the @entity14 said thursday			1
the notable exception was young emergency workers at the plant , who inhaled high doses of radioactive iodine , probably raising their risk of developing thyroid cancer			1
but since the thyroid is relatively resistant to cancer , the overall risk for these people remains low , the report said			1
otherwise , any increase in human disease after the partial meltdown triggered by the march 2011 tsunami is " likely to remain below detectable levels , " the @entity14 said in its report			1
people exposed as children in towns close to the @entity7 power plant are slightly more likely to contract leukemia , breast or thyroid cancer in the course of their lives than the general population , the @entity14 said			1
the power plant deteriorated into a level 7 disaster , according to the @entity57 , the most dangerous ranking on its scale			1
it was the worst disaster since the 1986 nuclear meltdown at @entity62 in the @entity63			2
but the gradual unfolding of the calamity gave @entity4 authorities time to evacuate many potential victims			0
the destruction from the tsunami also caused people to flee before the plant began to break down			1
the woman powering @entity4 's nuclear hopes @entity73 high psychological damage the @entity14 report highlights the psychological effects of disaster -- fear , anxiety and depression , possibly to the point of psychosomatic illness and psychiatric disorders			1
radiation emergencies can exacerbate these , the @entity14 said , because radiation is invisible , and people have a hard time understanding it and the magnitude -- whether large or small -- of its effects			1
whole nations may stigmatize people hailing from affected areas , making life harder on them if they move , the @entity14 said			1
opinion : what @entity4 leaders can learn from @entity7 stories of hardship a local woman in her late 80s , whom researchers interviewed for the report , was unconcerned about radiation exposure			0
" for generations , my family has lived in a close relationship with this land , " she told them			0
" i will feel accursed for losing the lands that my ancestors passed down to me			0
" the village of @entity111 in @entity4 's @entity7 prefecture was once home to 6,000 people			2
plant operator : we were n't prepared today , however , it is essentially a ghost town , evacuated after the nuclear accident just 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) away			2
for elderly couple @entity121 and @entity122 , life has not been easy			0
@entity121 had lived in his home in the village for more than 60 years , moving in just after @entity125 " i ca n't describe it			0
it 's hard living in the temporary housing , and it 's very stressful mentally , " he said			0
the difficult situation has also taken its toll on his wife , @entity131			0
we 're getting old , " she said			0
" i think every day how long i can survive in this situation			0
" the earthquake , tsunami and nuclear calamity have presented the population with three disasters at once , not to mention @entity4 's economic doldrums			2
the @entity14 warns that the sum of these may give rise to complicated health problems			1
@entity145 sailors sue @entity4 over nuclear accident direct radiation exposure those living in hardest - hit areas of @entity150 were exposed to radiation levels of 12 to 25 milliseverts ( msv ) in the first year since the disaster , the @entity14 reported			1
that 's equivalent to one or two cat scans , according to the @entity155			0
even on the upper end of the scale , that barely raises the risk of dying from cancer , the college says			1
according to @entity165 nuclear experts , exposure to less than 1,000 @entity163 annually causes no meaningful increase in the risk of getting cancer			2
husband of @entity7 suicide victim demands justice smoking is much more likely to			0
and coal - fired power plants kill more people than their nuclear counterparts do , according to the @entity176			2
resulting air pollution was expected to cause nearly 13,200 deaths in 2010 , not to mention 20,000 heart attacks per year			0
we are exposed to it through some minerals and from the sun. " the average person in the @entity185 receives an effective dose of about 3 msv per year , " the @entity155 says			2
the rest of @entity7 prefecture saw 3 to 5 msv in the first year , the equivalent of an x-ray			0
trying to revive a @entity7 ' ghost town ' discomforting signs although that may be less upsetting to know , after the @entity7 catastrophe , there have been discomforting signs -- and wonders			0
@entity198 found butterflies with a variety of mutations in @entity7 prefecture and beyond			0
radioactive iodine poured into the ocean at the reactor site , spiking at 1,250 times normal levels			0
offshore monitoring stations also detected high levels of cesium , a radioactive element			0
more than a year after the disaster , fish caught off the coast of @entity7 exhibited levels of cesium up to 250 times the amount the @entity4 government approves for consumption			2
isolated tests have revealed higher than normal concentrations of radioactive elements in other agricultural products in surrounding areas in the past			2
though the @entity14 sees no significant danger of radioactivity in the food chain raising the cancer risk , who wants to be the unlucky person to eat the wrong fish ? and although the cancer risk has risen only slightly in a very small area , this will be little comfort to the few additional people who get cancer after having been exposed to radiation near the @entity7 plant as little girls or young men			1
the @entity14 's report stresses that although its research has been thorough , the final effects of the radiation disaster wo n't be known until sometime in the future , when scientists will have the benefit of hindsight			1
radioactive levels staying high off @entity7			0

march 11 is the second *anniversary* of the great quake and tsunami
the cancer risk rose only slightly in very small areas near the reactors , the @entity14 says
young men , who *battled* the plant disaster , may see a rise in thyroid cancer
people exposed as children have a slightly elevated risk of certain cancers in their lifetimes
