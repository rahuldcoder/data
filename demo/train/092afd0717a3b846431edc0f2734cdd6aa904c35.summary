@entity1 , 45 , sold her house in @entity3 , @entity4 and threw in a successful career in @entity6 with @entity7 to take @entity9 studies in @entity10 -- " somewhere with real opportunities , " she said			2
@entity12 , a 27 - year - old from @entity13 , took a sabbatical from her managerial role at a large retail company to complete one year of her business degree in @entity10			2
" there 's so much more happening over here ( @entity10 ) than there is in @entity21 , " she said			1
and @entity22 , a 25 - year - old @entity23 with @entity10 parents said he " returned to the motherland " to get his mba at @entity27 to help differentiate himself from his @entity23 graduate - school peers			1
these three are just a few of the thousands of western students now flocking to @entity10 for higher education , cultural adventure and -- more often than not -- an edge in an extremely competitive job market			0
as @entity10 swell the ranks at western universities , the numbers of foreign students studying in @entity10 are also burgeoning -- increasing by 10 % in a year to more than 290,000 in 2011 , according to the @entity39 ( @entity40 )			1
the push for foreign students is a deliberate strategy by the @entity10 government -- through investment in scholarships and facilities -- to foster a greater understanding of their culture and language globally , and expand @entity54 's " soft power , " academics say			1
meanwhile , governments in the @entity23 , @entity56 and @entity21 also are investing in their own @entity10 study programs , often in conjunction with the @entity10 government , breeding a new generation of @entity10 - savvy graduates			1
" it 's student exchanges linked to diplomacy , " said @entity61 , a professor of education at the @entity63			0
@entity68 's soft power @entity10 's current five - year plan for the education sector aims for higher education institutes in the country to accommodate around 500,000 international students by 2020 , according to the state - run @entity75 news agency			1
@entity10 is rapidly expanding its @entity78 and @entity79 - language offerings -- 34 @entity10 universities now offer @entity79 - taught programs , according to the @entity40 -- and the government said it plans to fund 50,000 scholarships for overseas students by 2015			1
" if you look at @entity88 's speeches since he became president , he clearly says that we want soft power and we are willing to spend on this			1
and this is what the @entity10 government is doing ( with their international education programs ) , " said @entity93 , a @entity63 professor who has written extensively on the issue			0
governments in the @entity23 and @entity21 are investing in their own programs to encourage more of their students to study in @entity10			1
in 2010 , the @entity23 launched the " 100,000 @entity101 " that aims to increase the number of @entity23 students studying in @entity10 to 100,000 by 2014 , according to the 100,000 strong website			1
the @entity104 - to - @entity105 ( @entity106 ) , described by the @entity104 as " the third pillar of @entity104 - @entity10 relations , " facilitated the first - ever higher education talks between @entity21 and @entity10 in april , where the @entity10 government announced it would provide 30,000 scholarships for @entity104 students over the next five years , according to @entity75			2
but while the west wants improved relations , @entity93 believes @entity10 's communist system of government has resulted in a program more about control than diplomacy			2
" using education as part of a soft - power push has been practiced by many countries , " he said			2
" the @entity23 , @entity125 and @entity126 have been doing this for a long time			0
but the way the @entity10 are doing this is not skillful			0
" still , foreign students are pouring in			2
about 290,000 studied in @entity10 in 2011 , compared to just over 60,000 in 2001 , according to the @entity40			2
@entity131 ( 62,442 ) were the largest group of foreign students studying in @entity10 in 2011 , followed by @entity23 ( 23,292 )			1
the @entity126 ( 17,961 ) , @entity134 ( 13,340 ) , @entity135 ( 10,957 ) and @entity136 ( 9,370 ) also have large student populations , while almost 50,000 @entity21 undertook some form of tertiary study in @entity10 in 2011 , led by @entity125 ( 7,592 ) and @entity140 ( 5,451 )			1
are @entity10 universities up to the challenge ? while foreign students in @entity10 say it 's more exciting studying here than in the west , it 's also substantially cheaper			1
university tuition fees in @entity10 average about $ 1,000 per semester , according to the @entity40 , while rent , food and other incidentals are also substantially less			0
tuition fees alone in the @entity23 can cost anywhere from $ 12,000 to $ 37,000 per year , according to the @entity152 , depending on the type of institution			0
that 's on top of the average $ 15,000 per year required for accommodation , food and academic supplies			0
but questions have been raised over the quality of @entity10 's university education			2
" on international rankings , @entity10 universities did not perform as well as other countries , in particular given the size of the system , but there have been improvements in recent years , " said @entity163 , from @entity164 , a @entity165 - based education research organization			0
@entity93 , who regularly visits universities across @entity10 for his research , agrees			0
" i get many complaints about the quality of the teaching ( from foreign students studying in @entity10 ) , especially with regional universities			1
" professor @entity178 from the @entity179 said there is enormous diversity among the tertiary institutions in @entity10 , and far less quality programs that use @entity79 for instruction compared to countries like the @entity23 , @entity186 , @entity187 , and @entity188 , the top destinations for overseas university students in 2012 , according to @entity191			1
" the biggest barrier @entity10 faces in attracting overseas students is the medium of instruction			1
rightly or wrongly , @entity79 remains the language for business and academia and the rise of @entity10 is not going to change that overnight , " @entity178 said			0
learning through experience and while many @entity10 academics who trained overseas are now returning to @entity10 , attracting good - quality teachers and researchers with a high level of @entity79 remains a problem			1
@entity207 , an expatriate @entity23 professor and co-director at @entity210 's business school in @entity54 , says that although the teaching is rewarding , @entity10 wo n't be able to fill its " insatiable demand " for quality foreign professors until they start paying appropriate salaries			1
" this is @entity10 's century			2
here i have the ability to train some of most brilliant minds in the world and have a much bigger impact than i can anywhere else , " said @entity207 , when asked why he chose to teach in @entity10 over a western university			0
" i think i have the best job in the world for 29 days of the month			0
" but @entity54 is investing heavily in its universities to overcome gaps in quality , academics say			0
" there is definitely a desire to see institutions perform better in the rankings , " said @entity163			0
" funding through government programs are specifically designed to boost standards in ' key ' research areas , while the banding together of the top nine @entity10 institutions under the @entity239 is a clear indication that the country would like to see its best institutions competing at a global level of excellence			0
" for students like @entity22 , the shortcomings he has encountered with @entity210 's " relatively young " business program are more than compensated for in the lessons learned outside the classroom			0
" you should n't come to @entity10 looking for a @entity252 - style education or you will be disappointed , " @entity22 said			0
" previously education to me was all about the books and the quality of the classes , but you need to factor in the outside experiences as well			0
