" i 'm the same human , i 've got the same heart i had five years ago , " she says			0
" all the things about me are the same — same skin , same human — so it 's not a transition			2
it 's a movement , it 's a growth , it 's a change			2
yes , @entity6 had some reservations along the way			1
after debuting her single " @entity50 , " there was a moment when she questioned whether her single was going to break through			0
" you can never be sure when it comes to your first single , " @entity15 said			0

" you have to remember this a 20 - year - old evolving , " @entity94 said			0
" her dad is @entity15 , her godmother is @entity102 , and she 's raised in the era of ' hip - hop is king			0

" @entity6 ' @entity18 foam finger available for all your @entity112 needs 5			1
@entity6 is strategic and detail - oriented			2
@entity6 truly showcased her strong attention to detail as an artist when she grew frustrated after her plans for a grand entrance on the red carpet at the @entity18 fell apart			1
" everything we do has to be a moment , " @entity15 said			0
