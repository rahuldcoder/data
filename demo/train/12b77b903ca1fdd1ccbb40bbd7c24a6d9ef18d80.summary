the point - blank shooting of two @entity2 police officers this weekend is testing whether mayor @entity4 's brand of unapologetic liberalism can work in a city that 's spent decades under mayors who made law and order a top priority			1
@entity11 's pledge to reform police practices helped sweep him into office last year			2
and in recent weeks he 's pushed for the right of demonstrators to gather to protest the killings of @entity17 and @entity18 , two unarmed @entity21 - @entity20 men , at the hands of white police officers			2
but critics -- including those in the police force -- are accusing him of fomenting an anti-police fervor that contributed to the killings of officers @entity29 and @entity31			1
on monday , @entity4 tried to reduce tension in the city			1
" we have to get everyone to move away from anger and hatred , " he said during an afternoon press conference			2
" if there are differences , we have to address them peacefully			0
we have to give people faith that their concerns can be heard peacefully across the spectrum and we have to move forward			0
" he said @entity2 will not " be the kind of city it was meant to be if there is a division between our police and the community			2
" " the police are our protectors and they must be respected as such , " he added			2
he said the murders this weekend were " an attack on all of us " during luncheon remarks at the @entity58 shortly before his afternoon press conference			2
and the mayor also called for a hiatus from the protests that have gripped the city and the nation , saying the should focus instead on @entity29 and @entity31 ' families			1
" it 's time for everyone to put aside political debates , put aside protests , put aside all of the things that we will talk about in due time , " he said			0
" let 's accompany these families on their difficult journey			0
let 's see them through the funerals ... then the debate can begin again			0
" but during his afternoon press conference , he also pushed back against his critics , calling remarks from the head of the city 's police union " wrong and mistaken			1
" @entity11 also accused the media of contributing to the atmosphere of tension between police and protesters			0
" what are you guys gon na do — are you going to keep dividing us ? " a visibly angry @entity4 asked reporters , asserting that the media had unfairly focused on a few examples of violence that did not reflect the majority of protesters			1
" you all are part of this , too , " he added			0
president @entity104 and attorney general @entity105 have spoken out on the killings of @entity17 and @entity18 , calling for @entity20 to open up a dialogue on race and law enforcement and sharing their own experiences with racism			0
@entity104 has launched a task force to examine cases where there may be uneven applications of the law and propose fixes			0
but a startling divide between how white @entity20 and minorities view the criminal justice system , revealed by a new @entity123 / @entity122 poll , underscores the challenge facing both @entity4 and @entity104 as they struggle to find a solution to broken relationship between the police and the communities they serve			1
the nationwide poll , conducted largely before @entity29 and @entity31 were shot and released monday , shows 57 percent of white @entity20 think none or almost none of the police in their area are prejudiced against blacks			0
just a quarter of non-white @entity20 feel the same			0
and while 50 percent of white @entity20 say the criminal justice system treats blacks fairly , only 21 percent of non-white @entity20 agree			0
the shooting this weekend prompted police departments from @entity141 to @entity142 , to warn their officers to remain vigilant and watch out for potential copycat violence against them			1
former @entity2 mayor @entity146 said this weekend on @entity123 that @entity4 had sparked " intense , anti-police hatred " with his support for protesters			1
@entity150 , the head of @entity152 's police union , also lashed out at @entity4 , saying that there 's blood on the hands of those who have supported the protesters and it " starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor			1
" while @entity4 tried to downplay the politics of the situation during a press conference this weekend , @entity146 and others — largely @entity163 — have argued his policies are directly to blame			1
" it is the right time to talk about [ @entity4 's ] policies			1
his policies of allowing protests to get out of control , and of his not emphasizing enough the importance of fatherhood , the importance of education , the importance of an alternative to a public education system that is failing the black children , " @entity146 , a @entity163 , said on @entity171 this weekend			1
@entity146 also placed the blame on " propaganda " from the president			1
" we 've had four months of propaganda starting with the president , that everybody should hate the police			0
i do n't care how you want to describe it , that 's what those protests are all about , " @entity146 said			1
others took aim at @entity105			0
" sickened by these barbaric acts , which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric of @entity200 , " tweeted former @entity2 gov. @entity196 , a @entity163			0
still , tensions between the police and the city 's mayors are nothing new , and indeed have n't yet reached the breaking point they saw under former mayor @entity207 , who oversaw — and was unable to control — an all - out riot by police in 1992			2
then , much of the criticism from police was the same : " he never supports us on anything , " an officer quoted by the @entity216 said at the time			2
@entity2 police commissioner @entity218 said monday , however , that his first 10 years in the police force , in 1970 , " were around this type of tension			0
" @entity218 cautioned against politicizing the tragedy , but agreed that the shooting of the two officers this weekend " was a direct spinoff " of the recent protests , and that @entity4 has work to do in rebuilding support within the police community			1
" i think he has lost [ the trust of ] some officers , " @entity218 said .			0

critics slam mayor @entity4 for rhetoric , blaming it for inciting violence against police
former mayor @entity146 called the " intense , anti-police hatred "
two @entity152 officer were *gunned* down this weekend while on patrol in @entity244
