-- on its tenth anniversary in 2008 , @entity1 promised $ 10 million to the best five ideas for using technology to improve the world , through @entity6 -- a neat play on words ( 10 to the 100th power expresses the number " googol , " which is a one followed by one hundred zeroes )			1
@entity1 's intentions were good , of course -- $ 10 million spent the right way could have a real impact on these problems , which range from building better banking tools to a real - time , user - reported news service			1
however , the company 's follow - through leaves much to be desired			0
@entity1 announced this cash prize contest in september 2008 and closed public voting on 16 finalists chosen from over 150,000 ideas in october 2009			1
over eight months later , the company has yet to announce the winners			2
meanwhile , e-mails sent to @entity28 to the 100th 's @entity30 account are bouncing , indicating that @entity1 has deleted the address			2
and the company 's press department has yet to respond to our inquiries about the project			0
" we 'll announce the winning big ideas in the near future , " reads a notice on the project 's website , which lists " Â© 2009 @entity1 " at the bottom			1
according to @entity44 , who says his idea for mapping ongoing genocides and providing early warning of new ones is a finalist in the competition , @entity1 has not said a peep about this competition in nine months -- despite having apologized for delays as early as march 2009			1
" while genocide and other pressing problems relentlessly advance , it would seem that @entity28 ^ 100 does not , " @entity44 told @entity56			0
nine months since announcing their most recent delay			0
how hard can it be to give away ten million bucks ? harder than @entity1 can handle , apparently			1
" @entity1 , which reported revenue of $ 6.77 billion for the first quarter of this year , could practically consider $ 10 million to be a rounding error , so money is n't the problem			1
and the company already did the hard work of combining the overt 150,000 submitted ideas , many of which were duplicates or complementary , into 16 " theme " ideas , on which the public has already voted			0
assuming the project is still ongoing , @entity1 will select an organization already involved with the issue to receive a share of the cash with the goal of solving the problem			2
so all that remains for the company to do at this point is to announce the five winning ideas and the organizations that will receive the money to implement them			2
" an inspirational effort which began in the best @entity1 tradition seems to be mired in the worst @entity1 lapses , " said @entity44 , who brought this situation to our attention			0
" when can we expect the final projects to be funded ? or how about just a blog update ? " @entity1 's not talking -- not yet , anyway			1
but apparently , it 's the process of choosing the right organizations to address these issues that threatens to turn @entity1 's 10th birthday celebration into a 12th birthday surprise			0
