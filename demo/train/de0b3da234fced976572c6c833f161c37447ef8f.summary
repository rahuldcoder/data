-- @entity2 's book roll - out the past few days has shown , as expected , that she still commands an army of rapturous fans , but the best news for her this week came from the completely unexpected : the defeat of @entity8 leader @entity7			1
rarely has a @entity8 primary for a seat in the @entity11 had such wide repercussions			2
for @entity14 , they almost all run in her favor			0
consider just three : ( 1 ) prior to the @entity7 defeat , the @entity8 " establishment " thought they were starting to persuade middle - of - the - road voters that their party is not hostage to the tea party			1
after all , @entity8 establishment candidates so far this year have won five of seven @entity26 primaries where they were challenged by tea party candidates , most notably @entity29 's victory in @entity30			2
a public narrative was emerging that tea partiers remained a potent and , yes , welcome force in the @entity8 but that they are n't in charge			0
the defeat of @entity7 was a thunderclap transforming the landscape			2
because @entity7 is perceived as a strong conservative , and yet lost to an unknown on his right , the narrative has changed : now the story line is that the @entity8 base is not only angry but demands even tougher conservatism and even less compromise			1
all this plays directly into @entity14 's hands			2
if she formally declares , she can now stand before the electorate and assert with greater credibility that she -- not the @entity8 -- represents sensibility and moderation , a leader eager to work across the aisle			0
she even has greater latitude to embrace some of @entity58 's positions , appealing to the rise of a populist left , so long as she does n't veer too far from the middle ( where most voters still are )			0
( 2 ) @entity7 's defeat all but extinguishes lingering hopes that @entity65 and president @entity66 can work out a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform			1
two post-election polls have suggested that @entity7 's perceived openness to immigration reform was not the decisive factor in his defeat , but his opponent certainly seized on immigration as a stick to beat him over the head as an out - of - touch , wrong - headed reform advocate			1
in the wake of his defeat , it 's hard to see how other @entity8 incumbents will follow @entity7 's path			1
and for starters , they will likely be very wary of voting for immigration reform until dust settles			1
that , of course , is bad news for the @entity8 presidential nominee in 2016 and good news for @entity14 if she is the @entity93 standard bearer			1
@entity94 could only garner 27 % of the @entity96 vote in 2012 , far below the 40 % that pundits think is mandatory for victory			0
unless it finds a way out of the cul de sac , the @entity8 share could sink even lower this time			0
opinion : should @entity14 embrace @entity66 's foreign policy ? ( 3 ) we have n't yet heard from that corner , but one can only imagine that the @entity7 defeat , tied so closely to charges that he was for " amnesty " for illegal immigrants , is prompting second thoughts by @entity111 and his many admirers about whether 2016 is the right year for him to run			1
if @entity111 's deep belief in immigration reform would tear apart his party in the primaries and make his path to the @entity118 perilous at best , why should he ? if @entity111 decides not to go , that would be extremely welcome news to the @entity14 camp			1
from the point of view of @entity93 , the most obvious threat to a @entity14 victory is a @entity8 governor conservative enough to unite his party but moderate and experienced enough to pull in purple states			2
@entity111 and @entity128 are the two who come closest to that profile			0
conservatives may disagree -- many genuinely believe that a @entity132 can win -- but @entity93 will quietly celebrate if neither @entity111 nor @entity128 tops the @entity8 ticket			0
it is an oddity of @entity136 democracy that a tiny number of voters -- fewer than 8,000 -- in a suburb of @entity140 , @entity141 , can substantially alter the national outlook			0
but we live in odd , unpredictable times			0
no doubt other big surprises lie ahead before november 2016 .			0

@entity2 gets a gift from the @entity8 as she rolls out her book
@entity151 says @entity7 's defeat is a big plus for @entity14 if she runs in 2016
he says it *diminishes* the chance that she would face a goper with appeal to moderates
@entity151 : by placing immigration reform in jeopardy , the *upset* hurts @entity8 's 2016 appeal
