@entity0 , @entity1 -- the mother of a @entity1 woman missing for nearly a year is dismissing a recent turn in the search for her daughter that has led investigators to @entity10 , @entity11			1
in a statement released sunday , @entity13 -- mother of @entity14 -- said she " does not believe @entity14 is in @entity10 , nor does she believe the sighting of @entity14 by a teenage acquaintance is a credible sighting since he has not seen her since she was 15 years old , which was over nine years ago			1
" @entity13 , who has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against @entity20 's deputies for negligence in her daughter 's disappearance , suggested the recent turn in the investigation could be a " diversionary tactic " by @entity1 authorities			1
investigators have spent about six weeks checking out a high school classmate 's report that he saw @entity14 at a hotel casino , and are " unable to show that it is not a good lead , " @entity0 , @entity1 , police capt. @entity28 said thursday			1
detectives have talked to several witnesses since then who believe they have seen her in the area , he said			0
@entity14 , who would be 25 now , is a former beauty pageant contestant who was last seen leaving a @entity20 's station in @entity41 , @entity1 , in the early morning hours of september 17 , 2009			1
she had been arrested the previous evening at an upscale restaurant for allegedly not paying for her meal , and patrons at the restaurant said she exhibited strange behavior			0
her family has said the college honors graduate suffered from mental health issues and should have been kept at the sheriff 's station until a relative arrived to pick her up			0
" @entity13 hopes this is not a diversionary tactic to redirect attention and efforts away from where @entity14 was last known to be last seen -- leaving the @entity0 sheriff 's department , @entity60 station , without her cell phone , money , transportation , or asthma medication , which is where their massive search efforts and public plea should be concentrated , " the statement , signed by @entity13 , said			1
it added : " the more time spent following leads in @entity10 , is less time spent following up on facts in the @entity72 [ @entity1 ] and surrounding area			2
" @entity13 also disputed authorities ' claims that the person who reported seeing @entity14 in @entity10 spent significant time with her daughter			1
" contrary to law enforcement official statements during their press conference , @entity14 did not grow up with , go to school with , nor spend any significant time with this witness , " the statement said			2
according to the wrongful death and negligence suit filed last month in @entity88 , authorities launched a homicide investigation into @entity14 's disappearance in december			1
the lawsuit claims @entity14 suffered " grievous bodily harm and loss of life			0
" @entity13 argues in the lawsuit that the sheriff 's department failure to administer psychiatric or medical evaluations and the fact that @entity14 was released " alone in an unfamiliar area without money , a cellular phone or means of transportation amounts to negligence			2
" the lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages			0
@entity108 , a spokesman for the sheriff 's department , told @entity2 in september that the decision to release @entity14 was made because " she was not intoxicated , she did n't exhibit any mental issues , so when we were done running her fingerprints and criminal history , then we are obligated by law to release her from custody			2
" police have not discounted the possibility that @entity14 may not want to be found , but her family believes that would be " out of her character , " @entity117 said			0
" we could find that out , but we 'll never know that until we actually talk to @entity14 , " he said			0
@entity2 's @entity125 contributed to this report .			0
