-- our gun debate continues to revolve around measures to prevent deranged people from using military - style weapons to massacre innocent people			1
this is a worthy goal			0
we should do all we can do , within the limits of our @entity9 , to reduce the number and deadliness of these tragedies			0
but i am increasingly concerned that the debate will never evolve to include deeper sources of gun violence in our country			1
after all , most people killed by guns in the @entity20 are not killed in school massacres by villains carrying ar - 15s			1
they are killed one at a time , and usually by handguns			2
all too often , they die in urban and rural communities in economic distress			0
more people die in gun suicides than gun murders			1
this is the real gun violence epidemic			1
and universal background checks -- as important and necessary as that step is -- will not do much to curb it			1
i had hoped the national debate might expand to include a deeper discussion of what is really happening with gun violence in @entity20			1
so far , it has not			0
the conversation did not change much , even after @entity42 , who marched with her @entity45 classmates in president @entity47 's second inaugural parade , was shot and killed in a park while talking with her friends			2
she was only 15 years old			0
the truth is that her story is tragically common in @entity20			0
and the most disputed ideas out of @entity54 , like an assault weapons ban , would n't do much to change that reality			1
opinion : more gun mayhem , and yet we wait for action what can be done to really reduce the senseless slaughter in schools like @entity64 and on the streets in cities like @entity45 ? should we close the loophole that allows people to buy guns without a basic background check ? yes			1
get illegal guns off the street ? yes			2
@entity74 assault weapons ? of course			1
these things should have been done years ago			0
for the decades of inaction , we can thank the @entity78 , a gun manufacturers ' lobby that has divorced itself from reality			2
should we put armed guards in every school ? probably not			0
more weapons do not necessarily make us safer			2
and the price for doing so might keep us from measures that are smarter and statistically more effective , like better mental health services and counseling for students on the edge			2
proposals for " armed schools " may help the @entity78 sell more guns , but they do n't address the underlying problems			2
they also risk leaving the rest of us in a perpetual high - fear , low - trust society			0
what could really turn the tide ? much of the daily violence is linked to economic desperation and despair			2
areas of concentrated poverty continue to be linked to violent crime			2
in @entity45 , the most poverty - stricken neighborhoods have the highest homicide rate			0
studies by the @entity108 , @entity109 , and even the @entity110 note the link between lack of opportunity and violence			1
we should be focused on connecting people , especially young men , to training and employment			1
as i said recently on " @entity122 , " nothing stops a bullet like a job			0
as author and journalist @entity127 told @entity0 , in violent @entity45 neighborhoods , " @entity125 is fiction			0
" @entity78 chief : why we fight for gun rights fixing that by making sure every @entity20 has a chance to climb the ladder to opportunity is a good place to start			1
beyond that , many community programs are having success at creating more peaceful streets			0
for example : in @entity141 , the @entity140 has created a safer neighborhood by working with residents to shut down a troublesome liquor store and connecting families to jobs resources			0
the @entity148 is a successful example of an @entity47 administration program , @entity150 , that has received too little money and too little attention			0
@entity155 's @entity154 program reduces gun violence by providing mediating services and resources for youth to participate in community service programs and job training			1
a university of @entity164 study even found that greening vacant lots in cities helps reduce gun violence			1
these programs and the crying need for jobs should be at the center of any discussion about reducing the horrifying death toll in our nation			0
every child dead is a massacre , whether it happens in unspeakable numbers in a schoolhouse or one by one on the streets of @entity45			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			1

@entity184 : gun debate needs to go beyond background checks and assault weapons
@entity184 : gun violence also tied to poverty , mental illness , lack of opportunity
@entity184 : most people killed by guns in suicides , then in murders , not in mass shootings
@entity184 : we need jobs , education , activist community groups to help young people
