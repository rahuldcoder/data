asked if anyone had @entity11 skills , " she said , in reference to the programming platform			2
" and someone jogged over to them with a huge grin on their face			2
" it was n't a traditional weekend , of course			2
@entity3 was one of the planners of the @entity22 event , one of about a dozen such " hackathons " held last weekend around the world			1
about 1,500 self - proclaimed hackers and technology enthusiasts attended			2
it was a weekend of synthesis brought about by what @entity30 organizer @entity29 called " brains colliding			2
" the @entity34 events bring together disaster relief and climate change organizations and a variety of programmers and developers to see if they can generate new solutions to old problems -- in the space of a single weekend			1
the @entity22 umbrella organization was founded in 2009 by @entity44 , @entity45 , the @entity46 , @entity47 , and @entity48			1
this weekend was its third international event , and saw teams competing locally in places as far - flung as @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , @entity56			2
@entity57 and @entity59 organizer @entity58 was proud to point out that almost every single person at @entity59 stayed the whole 36 hours , eating and sleeping at the hackathon , to get their projects done			2
" what was really exciting was seeing a group of young people who are very talented just dive right in and be so dedicated that they stayed overnight			2
" you might not think even the smartest computer wizards could build much in just a day or two			0
but you 'd be wrong			0
@entity34 events often end with fully functional products			1
and the products they create are as diverse as the teams that made them			1
in @entity76 , @entity77 , the main focus was on tools relating to flooding and landslides			0
organizer and @entity82 said the top prize - winning hacks there both dealt with new , inexpensive ways to track and understand rainfall and to educate @entity77 about disaster risk			1
at the end of the conference , a new kind of synthesis was already occurring			1
" we had nine problems with solutions in @entity76 , and after the event , the groups were coordinating a collaboration , putting all those solutions together into one package of software , " he said			0
" hacks to identify risks , in the event to find survivors and use social media to connect them , and then to fix things and manage costs post-event			0
" in @entity59 , the @entity34 weekend started out with a presentation about challenges faced by the @entity113 @entity112			1
one new solution would help the @entity112 manage volunteers , from their names and skills to keeping track of the hours they 've worked so they do n't overexert themselves			0
another focused on @entity123 and people taking anti-retroviral drugs			0
these people are of particular concern in disaster situations because they have to take their medication at precise intervals			1
a new @entity34 application could help coordinate efforts to prevent an interruption of that schedule			1
interestingly , two versions of the same hack won the @entity137 , @entity138 , and @entity30 , @entity139 , @entity34 events			1
@entity141 will take messages from people isolated in a disaster and keep them until it finds a data connection			1
@entity137 participant @entity146 explains how this works : " a relief worker goes into a devastated area where cell towers are wiped out and allows people to input messages into their phone			1
once they return to an area that has connectivity , it will send all the messages for those people			0
kind of like collecting letter mail for people			0
" one @entity163 team designed a " @entity170 , " a fire - and weather - monitoring sensor that can be mounted on buildings in urban areas or float on weather balloons for emergencies			0
@entity3 says @entity170 hack was her favorite " because it was hardware hacking at a type of event which is usually software only			0
" the @entity170 could also be used as an emergency @entity177 in case of the general loss of internet connectivity			0
although the stated mission of @entity183 addressed disaster and climate issues , not all of the solutions presented followed this guideline			1
four different hacks attempted to connect food providers ( like caterers with leftover lasagna ) with local food banks to avoid waste			0
a @entity195 team developed an already - functional application to allow local shoppers to find retailers participating in the federal @entity199			2
one @entity163 team created an application to educate individuals about environmental hazards			0
it would combine a variety of data sources and tell its user about the water and air quality , among other factors , in their specific current location , and also identify the specific legislator who should be contacted with complaints			0
in a true nod to geekdom , its current name is " eco-tricorder			0
" some of the solutions at @entity34 herald a new direction for the organization			1
this weekend , @entity34 announced that it will broaden its mission statement to include all challenges of global development , including water issues			1
@entity224 of @entity225 , @entity34 's global operational lead , explained by e-mail : " the first will be the @entity229 in october , where hackers are going to take on the world 's single largest cause of illness : lack of safe water and inadequate sanitation			1
" so hackers , fire up your engines			0
but those who might not label themselves hackers are welcome too			0
everybody has a useful skill , according to @entity58 : " anyone who 's got any skill , @entity34 is not closed to you			1
it 's a way to figure out how you can use what you 've got to serve development			0

one dozen @entity22 events held around the world
events bring together disaster relief / climate change organizations and programmers / developers
