-- for @entity3 's football team , the pressure is on			1
next year the @entity4 arrives in the @entity6 country for only the second time , with the nation 's near 200 million inhabitants expecting to celebrate a record sixth triumph in the tournament			1
but all is not well in the land of " jogo bonito " -- the beautiful game			0
so much so that with @entity3 falling to an all - time low of 18th in the world rankings , a couple of old stagers are back to try and breathe new life into a nation that in many ways represents the very essence of international football			1
@entity23 , the coach of @entity3 's 2002 @entity4 winners , has been drafted in to replace @entity25			1
and one of @entity23 's first actions was to recall a hero of the triumphant campaign in @entity30 and @entity31 11 years ago			1
against @entity32 in wednesday 's @entity33 friendly , @entity34 , a two - time @entity35 , was back in the famous gold shirt for the first time in over a year as he looked to enhance his chances of making the squad for 2014			1
' @entity40 ' but the plan failed			0
@entity23 , @entity34 and co. slipped to a 2 - 1 defeat , with @entity32 playing more of the slick , attacking football @entity3 has made its trademark			1
for @entity34 , now plying his trade with @entity49 in his homeland after dazzling for @entity51 between 2003 and 2008 , it was a miserable evening			2
off the ball , his laid back , border - line lazy approach was as recognizable as the beaming grim beneath his abundant curly locks			2
but in possession , the bursts of acceleration which helped him become the world 's most feared player during his halcyon days with @entity51 were less apparent			2
his killer instinct in front of goal also seemed to have deserted him			0
when his 19th - minute penalty was saved by @entity32 goalkeeper @entity65 , suspicions grew that the 87,000 plus spectators inside the stadium were watching a ghost			1
after 45 minutes @entity23 had also seen enough and @entity34 did not emerge for the second half			1
" he 's very important , he 's a ' craque ' , " @entity3 and @entity71 midfielder @entity70 said after the game , using a term which refers to a technically gifted player			1
" we all know about his great quality ... we all know how important he is and we just hope he 's ok physically , " added @entity70			2
despite a low key performance which saw @entity34 out ran and out thought by @entity32 's midfield trio of @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , @entity3 captain @entity78 also hailed the qualities of the 32 - year - old			1
" it 's a privilege to play with him , " said the @entity71 defender			2
" no doubt about it			0
not only for his football , but also for the person he is			0
" you saw when @entity34 came on the screen , everyone was raving and that just shows how big he is in world football			2
" as well as past stars like @entity34 , it was also a tough test for the emerging crop of @entity104 superstars			2
@entity106 , the third of @entity71 's @entity104 trio , @entity110 's @entity109 and playmaker @entity113 winners @entity105 all struggled to live up to their lofty billing			0
@entity116 - clad attacker but most worrying of all was the performance of @entity118			0
if @entity34 is yesterday 's hero , the @entity120 schemer has long had the billing of today 's @entity123 shining star			1
yet the @entity116 - clad attacker was subdued throughout - as he had been in @entity3 's @entity125 final defeat by @entity126 in august at @entity33 -- struggling to shake off the stubborn defensive work of @entity32 right back @entity128			1
so if @entity3 are to lift the @entity4 next year , the player widely regarded as the third best in the world behind @entity131 and @entity132 will have to lift his game considerably			1
" it did not go as i had expected or wanted , " the 21 - year - old @entity118 told reporters			2
" i would have liked to help the team more , but today was not my day			0
" wednesday 's defeat might stir memories of the last time @entity3 hosted the @entity4 in 1950			1
needing just a draw to be crowned world champions in the final game of the tournament , @entity3 lost 2 - 1 to @entity143 and missed out on a first @entity4 triumph -- an event referred to by playwright @entity146 as " our @entity147 "			1
that loss scarred @entity104 society -- a similar failure next year is unimaginable			0
" our chances of winning the @entity4 are big , " said @entity3 's @entity153 defender @entity152			2
" that 's our mentality , that 's what we are focused on			0
in our heads we ca n't go there and think if we finish second or third that 's enough			0
" the fans will be very important			0
you can expect every game to be 60,000 , 70,000 people together with us , and we are going to use their emotion to make us stronger on the pitch			0
" we have great players who are used to pressure and our motivation is really high			0
" @entity70 was is similarly defiant mood			0
" we are going to be ready , " said @entity71 midfielder			0
" we are going in to win the @entity4			0

@entity3 lose 2 - 1 to @entity32 at @entity173 , @entity174
the match was the first of @entity23 's second spell as coach
@entity23 called @entity34 into the @entity3 squad for the first time in a year
@entity3 captain @entity78 is *confident* his country can with the @entity185
