@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity0 area seems to be enjoyed most by people who live somewhere else			0
@entity6 's offers freshly caught fish and a great view from a deck overlooking the @entity10			1
more often than not snowbirds , the yearly visitors who winter in @entity1 , and other tourists appear to take over			0
but there are plenty of places that are beloved by locals and wo n't cost you a fortune			0
a good first stop is @entity21 , the pedestrian boulevard that runs almost the width of @entity24			1
a farmers ' market each sunday is a weekly meeting point for many locals , and although the area has lost some of its identity to chains , there are plenty of unique restaurants and shops to sample			0
start your stroll on @entity38 with coffee at @entity40 ( 1654 @entity41 )			2
from a large open window facing the street , the cafe keeps the @entity46 coffee flowing 24/7 to a wide mix of @entity48 who line up for their caffeine fix			1
not too much @entity50 is spoken here though , so practice the following : cafecito ( a shot of sugary @entity46 coffee ) , cortadito ( sugary @entity46 coffee cut with milk ) and café con leche ( a @entity57 latte )			1
a block west of @entity59 's is @entity60 ( 1626 @entity61 ) , which devoted regulars will swear serves the best ice cream in the world			1
a taste of one of the many flavors of ice cream or sorbet -- made from fresh local fruits -- may make you a convert as well			2
flavors such as wasabi or tamarind have to be tried to be believed			0
whether it 's the best in the world is open for debate , but for sure @entity60 serves the best scoops in @entity0			1
at @entity80 's , on the @entity81 of @entity38 ( 1040 @entity21 ) , the real attraction is people watching			2
it 's the place to see and be seen in @entity24			1
customers spending hundreds of dollars on champagne and cocktails or a few bucks on coffee and simple snacks enjoy the same great view of local characters on parade and the beautiful people who act as if @entity21 were their own personal catwalk			2
@entity97 , on the @entity96 side of @entity24 is @entity99 restaurant ( 1787 @entity100 ) , a bastion of good food and service that a crowd of mostly local clientele has kept going for nearly a decade			1
the restaurant has locations in other cities , but walking into the low - key @entity24 dining room you would swear you stumbled onto a well - kept secret			2
@entity99 's serves really fresh comfort food : steaming plates of mussels in an @entity115 broth , homemade pastas , great burgers and a killer meatloaf			1
this is not the place for celebrity sightings and the latest trendy food , but you will eat well and not break the bank			0
many @entity0 restaurants boast they serve the freshest fish in town , but few have their own fishing fleet to back up the claim			0
@entity6 's @entity131 and @entity132 ( 398 n.w. n. @entity133 , @entity0 ) offers its own freshly caught fish and a great view from a deck overlooking the @entity10			1
it 's a trick to get there , and the restaurant is one of the few bright spots in a still run - down area of downtown @entity0 , so go with good directions			0
as you lunch on a mahi - mahi sandwich with a beer served in an ice - cold mug and watch the boats go by , the trip to @entity6 's will seem well worth the effort			1
it would n't be @entity0 , of course , without the beach , and every local has his or her own preferred strip of sand			0
the beach at @entity160 and @entity161 is a favorite for people who want to relax with the sunday paper and a fold - out chair			0
the water and sand seem cleaner than most other beaches and the area is a favorite for kite surfers			0
if you are n't already a local , you soon will feel like one after a few hours there with the sand between your toes .			0
