@entity0 , @entity1 -- one media outlet billed it as the miners versus @entity6			1
the seemingly invincible 33 miners from @entity8 and five of their rescuers toured the @entity12 theme park on friday , and they were entertained with a tram ride through a tunnel featuring a lifelike @entity16 clash with @entity6 and @entity17			1
" one more time ! one more time ! " the miners , the rescuers and their relatives chanted after the short movie feature concluded			1
the earthshaking simulator -- rocking the tram as if it were under attack by the beasts of the " @entity6 " ' film -- did n't scare the miners , who were trapped 69 days after their gold and copper mine collapsed in august			1
" why not , " the tram driver said			2
" let 's do it again			1
the miners of @entity8 -- who survived the longest mine entrapment in history -- had their way again , along with their relatives and the five rescuers			1
helicopters and other tv news crews continued to follow them			2
the miners , rescuers and relatives are in @entity0 this week for their first group tour to the @entity47 since being freed last month			1
the group is in the nation 's second - largest city to attend " @entity51 : an all - star tribute , " which will air worldwide on @entity54 evening , november 25			1
organizers invited them as special guests			2
on thursday , the entourage visited @entity60 landmarks such as the @entity62 stars on @entity63 , including one belonging to @entity64			2
it was an appropriate pilgrimage because miner @entity66 had led sing - alongs to @entity64 music to lift the spirits of fellow miners during the dark ordeal			1
in fact , he had asked for the music to be sent down into the mine as rescuers drilled a bigger hole to pull the miners out of the ground			1
" he is the king , he is the best , " @entity66 , 34 , said , as he posed for photographs beside @entity64 ' star on @entity63			2
" the sweetest of dreams			0
" one passerby , @entity84 , 30 , a writer , was surprised to happen upon the miners			1
he was returning home from a @entity87			0
" to me they 're real heroes , and i think it 's beautiful they 're out in @entity60 , " @entity84 said			1
" i thought a celebrity was here but this is better than a celebrity			0
" for the majority of the visitors , the trip was their first time outside of @entity8			1
at the top of their to - do list , besides resting after a 12 - hour flight from @entity101 , @entity8 , was shopping			1
" i want to go to the mall and buy some shoes for my son and daughter , " said @entity106 , 40 , the wife of @entity107			1
for miner @entity113 , 49 , and wife @entity115 , 40 , the visit was a double celebration -- because they experienced the birth of their first grandchild , @entity119 , born wednesday			1
when @entity113 was trapped in the mine , his wife was concerned whether the ordeal would be too much of a strain on her pregnant 17 - year - old daughter , @entity125			1
" we were really worried , " @entity115 said , speaking in @entity126 as did his colleagues			0
" my daughter was far into her pregnancy and we were all consumed with what could happen			1
for those 69 days , we were a separated family			0
" the miner - poet @entity132 said he overcame the gloom of entrapment by doing something he had never done before : write poetry			1
he wrote 32 poems -- about his wife , mother , son , relatives , friends			1
he left copies of his verse at home and was unable to share his poetry			0
" i never wrote before , " @entity132 said			0
" it was a way of keeping me from suffering inside the mine			0
i wrote about feelings and how people were suffering on the outside and how they would ever rescue us			0
" like some other miners , he readily offered up his autographs to anyone wanting to meet him			2
" @entity157 , " he wrote in @entity126 near his name			0
@entity158 , the wife of @entity159 , the first miner who was pulled out of the ground last month , described the 69 days of waiting and wondering as one of her worst experiences			1
" it was bad , really bad , " said @entity158			0
" i could n't believe it			0
i was worried about his life , but i believed they would all survive because i had faith and hope			0
" she has since noticed a few different things about herself and husband			0
" we have changed , " @entity158 said			0
" we are more sentimental , and we enjoy more what moments we have together			2
" before arriving in @entity0 , the group made a brief stopover at @entity180 in @entity181 , @entity182 , where the miners signed flags			2
one signed " @entity188 , " which means " heart of a miner			2
" when miner @entity190 prepared to board the plane in @entity101 , @entity8 , on wednesday night , the 27 - year - old said he has only traveled to @entity193			1
" i want to see the world , " he said , smiling			0
" i know all of @entity8 , but not the rest of the world			1
" @entity190 , a mechanic , worked at the @entity198 mine for two years			0
his girlfriend was pregnant while he was trapped			2
the miners captured the world 's imagination when they survived the longest mine captivity in history , beginning august 5			1
for more than two weeks , many officials thought they were dead			0
but crews made contact after a small borehole enabled communication with the men trapped 2,300 feet underground			0
rescue crews encountered repeated setbacks			0
initially , authorities expected the miners to be trapped until @entity54 or @entity215 because of the difficulty of drilling a new tunnel to extract them			2
on their @entity47 trip , the miners and rescuers will get a whirlwind tour of southern @entity1			2
they 'll see the sights and shop in @entity0 and @entity60 through the weekend			0
the visit is a world away from the miners ' experience in the weeks after the mine collapse that trapped them			2
in the days before they made contact with the ground , some ate about a bottle cap 's worth of canned fish per day and drank mine water that tasted like machine oil			2
they have said they were prepared to die , even as they awaited their rescue			0
the miners and rescuers were invited by @entity2 to attend " heroes , " an annual program now in its fourth year that shines a light on " everyday people changing the world			1
" the @entity8 were extended the invitation because their plight and rescue captured the world 's attention and symbolized the resilience of the human spirit			1
@entity51 received 10,000 nominations from more than 100 countries			0
that list was narrowed down to the @entity257 @entity51			0
the @entity51 will be revealed on the show ; the public votes to select that winner			0
" the heroic efforts of the rescue of these miners was one of the most unifying and inspirational events of the year , " said @entity261 , president of @entity262			1
" @entity51 is a fitting way for @entity2 to honor these men and their rescuers , " he said			0
" we hope viewers around the world will be heartened by the story of their rescue as well as the stories of this year 's top 10 @entity51			1
" ' the miners ' imprisonment began when a ramp into the @entity198 mine -- located in the arid @entity281 of northern @entity8 -- collapsed			1
shift foreman @entity66 told the men that they had a shot of surviving the catastrophe , but there was a good chance they would never again see daylight			0
the men occupied themselves by voting on everything , including how food should be distributed			0
majority rule prevailed -- 17 votes plus one -- but the miners often managed to find common ground and most decisions were unanimous			1
no one was left alone			0
and they became masters of compromise and patience , even as their rations quickly began running out			0
@entity2 's @entity305 and @entity306 contributed to this report .			2
