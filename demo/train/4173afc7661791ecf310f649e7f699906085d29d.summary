-- @entity1 on thursday blocked access to @entity3 -- a day after it shut down the social networking site @entity5 -- in response to an online group calling on people to draw the @entity9			1
the @entity11 ordered operators to shut down @entity3 " in view of growing sacrilegious contents on it , " officials said in a statement			1
@entity11 said thursday it reached its decision after all " possible avenues were used within its jurisdiction , including using regular channels available on the @entity5 and @entity3 to launch protest , to avoid appearances of derogatory material available on their websites			1
" @entity5 was blocked a day before " @entity26 , " which was scheduled by several @entity5 groups dedicated to the idea			1
the largest of the groups was unavailable for several hours wednesday and thursday			0
@entity5 said " a small technical issue prevented some users from accessing this page and others for a very short period of time , " and that @entity5 had corrected the problem as quickly as possible once they became aware of it			1
" while it may be considered objectionable to some , the @entity40 in question do not violate our policies , " @entity5 global communications director @entity39 said			1
the page was online as of thursday morning eastern time			0
@entity45 said @entity5 was " very disappointed " to be blocked in @entity1			1
" we are analyzing the situation and the legal considerations , and will take appropriate action , which may include making this content inaccessible to users in @entity1 , " she said			1
@entity53 of @entity1 's telecommunication authority said the block " is related to the objectionable material that was placed on @entity5			1
" " we have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time			2
we are just following the government 's instructions and the ruling of the @entity62			1
if the government decides to unblock it , then that 's what we will do , " he said			1
the telecommunication authority has not received any complaints from @entity71 users about the blocking of @entity5 , he said			1
@entity74 @entity73 consider it offensive to depict @entity9			1
there were riots around the world in response to a series of cartoons of @entity9 in a @entity83 newspaper in 2005 , and at least two @entity85 cartoonists live under police protection after publication of their drawings of the @entity90 prophet			1
@entity91 , who started one of the @entity5 groups , said she read about the idea on a blog after @entity96 bleeped out part of an episode of " @entity99 " that mentioned the prophet			1
" this is meant to be in protest , " she said			0
" this is something i have felt strongly about for a long time : bullying by certain @entity90 groups will not be tolerated in a free country , " said @entity91 , who is @entity105			0
but @entity108 , a spokesman for the @entity109 , said the idea behind the group was offensive			2
" @entity90 discourages any visual representations of the prophets of @entity114 -- @entity117 , @entity116 , @entity9 , anybody -- because we believe it can lead to a form of idol worship , " he said			1
" the majority of @entity73 worldwide object to any representation of a prophet of @entity114 , " he added			1
the idea of " @entity26 " originated with a cartoonist who has since distanced herself from the idea , @entity91 and @entity108 said			2
" the whole campaign has been taken up by muslim - bashers and @entity130 , " @entity108 said			0
but @entity91 denied being anti-muslim			0
" this extends beyond being able to draw @entity9 , " she said			2
" if it 's offensive to you , that 's fine , but i do n't feel it 's right to impose your belief on others through intimidation			2
" this is nothing to do with hate or bigotry , " she said			0
" nobody is inciting violence or preaching open hatred towards individuals			0
" @entity91 said she is not a muslim but added that she had received " hundreds of e-mails from people trying to explain this to me			0
" one group member said she saw anger and fear on both sides of the controversy but felt that free speech could not be compromised			0
" this is a hot - topic debate , but so is abortion , illegal immigrants , gay marriage and politics			0
if we allow even a small compromise for one group , then the free speech on topics like abortion , illegal immigrants and politics can also be censored based on accusations that they cause violence or hate , " @entity162 said on @entity0 's @entity163			0
" hate speech is wanting a group eradicated , physically harmed or dead			0
i do n't think drawing @entity9 falls under that category , " she said			2
" @entity90 is not above criticism or cartoons			0
i believe in equality , and censoring @entity9 while we can draw every other figure in the world does not equal equality , " she concluded			2
@entity91 said @entity1 's decision to block @entity5 was " ridiculous			1
" @entity91 's group had attracted more than 9,000 fans as of thursday morning			0
the page which disappeared briefly had more than 80,000 fans			0
groups opposing the idea had about 68,000 fans as of wednesday			0
@entity5 is investigating the block , said @entity45 , the communications director			2
" we want @entity5 to be a place where people can openly discuss issues and express their views , while respecting the rights and feelings of others , " she told @entity0			2
" we sometimes find people discussing and posting about topics that others may find controversial , inaccurate , or offensive			0
when these feelings , or any content reported to us becomes an attack on anyone , including @entity90 people , it will be removed and further action may be taken against the person responsible , " she said .			0
