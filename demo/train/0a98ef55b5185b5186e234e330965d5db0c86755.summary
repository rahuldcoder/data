there 's only one way to start an interview with @entity4			1
why , i ask him , should i believe a word he says ? " i like that question , " says the pre-eminent @entity10 conceptual artist , when we meet in the caf√© at @entity14 's @entity13			1
" i believe that doubting is the first step to rational knowledge			1
not doubting implies submission , which is dangerous			1
" if truth be told , there are more reasons to doubt @entity4 than anyone else			1
after all , this is the man who has pranked , dodged and bamboozled his way to the top of the art world			2
fake files in 1987 , in an exhibition called @entity33 , he pretended that he had stumbled across the hidden archives of a @entity36 zoologist called dr @entity37 , which contained samples of animals previously unknown to science			1
ten years later , he convinced the world that a @entity44 cosmonaut had been lost in space in 1967 , and the disappearance covered up			2
the hoax fooled @entity10 tv , which reported it as fact before realizing that the cosmonaut 's name , @entity51 , was a @entity44 translation of the artist 's own name			1
and at the age of 59 , the diminutive , bearded @entity4 has lost none of his enthusiasm for " playing with conceptions of authority "			1
last month he pretended to " curate " an exhibition in @entity64 called the @entity65 , which mixed genuine photographs from the @entity67 and @entity68 with his own pastiche , passing it all off as a single archive			1
from now to november , the @entity13 -- that bastion of empiricism -- is hosting a major retrospective exhibition of @entity4 's work , entitled @entity76			1
it starts with taxidermy , including a squirrel with a snake 's tail and a winged goat ; moves on to photographs of " constellations " that are actually specks of dust on a car windscreen ; and ends with pictures of the artist himself performing " miracles " , such as levitation , in the garb of a @entity90 monk			1
the exhibition is visually arresting , subversively humorous , and infernally clever			1
it is also deeply unsettling			2
so what is it about @entity4 that makes him so intent on fooling the world ? explosive moment " when i was 13 , i was experimenting in chemistry and i blew up my hand , " he says , sipping espresso			1
" i was interested in testing things , and was building rockets with gunpowder			2
it was wonderful , very effective			2
but one sunday my parents were away traveling , and i was alone with my cousin			2
" and i blew up my hand			2
" psychologically , this was very strong			2
it changed my whole life			2
i started hiding my hand so people did n't see my problem , which produced very complex human relationships			2
life became about multiple truths			2
" because of his damaged hand , he continues , he was excluded from military service , giving him " time to play with photography "			1
as he could n't handle the camera quickly , photojournalism was out			2
so he became a " meditative photographic artist "			1
he shows me the stump of his left index finger			0
he has told other journalists that he lost his finger while building a " homemade bomb "			0
is he taking me for a ride -- or them ? ( or has this interview made me paranoid ? ) " well , you could consider it a bomb , " he says			0
i used to make explosive artifacts and throw them out of the window			0
i also did underwater explosives with sodium			0
i made miniature submarines and ships , and blew them up with mines			0
" the world of @entity4 is strange indeed			1
propaganda machine bombs and rockets aside , it was the political climate in which he came of age that informed @entity4 's career			1
prior to 1975 , @entity155 ruled @entity10 as a dictatorship			0
the climate of repression and the ubiquity of propaganda in @entity4 's childhood led him to a preoccupation with challenging authority in all its forms			1
" @entity155 is no longer the enemy , but to me he was just one particular historical manifestation of authoritarianism , " he says			0
" i struggle against every type of authority , in religion , science , politics , and art. i do n't believe in hierarchies			1
" does that make him a @entity173 ? " i am a bizarre combination of socialism with anarchy thrown in , " he says			0
" but i 'm also a pragmatist			0
i recognize that a representative democracy is necessary			0
but it has risks , and we must keep paying attention to the system			0
that 's why i call myself an anarchist			1
i 'm trying to fix the problems of authoritarianism that might occur in a representative democracy			0
" an irreverent eye he illustrates this by citing photography			1
documentary photojournalism , he says , is valuable as an " eye in the distance " , showing people things to which they otherwise would never be exposed			0
his role is that of the " oculist " , ensuring that the eye remains accurate by questioning the veracity of what it shows us			0
religion is a favorite target			0
although he was brought up a @entity209 , as a teenager he experimented with @entity210 and other alternative religions , before becoming a committed agnostic			0
" the reason i often joke about religious belief is that it brings us to dogma , and to me dogma is stupidity , " he says			0
" i do n't agree with faith			0
i think we should keep a questioning mind			1
" so what next for @entity225 ? " i have lots of ideas and not enough time , " he says			0
" people often get angry with me , and accuse me of being a liar			0
i just create ambiguities and encourage people to question things			0
" he sighs , and drains his coffee			0
" my mother is always warning me that one day i will finish in jail			0
but i have more trust in humanity than that			0
" @entity4 : stranger than @entity238 is showing at the @entity13 , @entity14 , from 23 july -- 9 november 2014 touch it , you know you want to			1
