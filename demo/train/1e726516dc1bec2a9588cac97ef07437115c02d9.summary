@entity0 , @entity1 -- do a series of photos of gun - toting men wearing green uniforms prove @entity8 forces are operating in eastern @entity1 ? @entity1 officials point to the pictures in a dossier obtained monday by @entity2 , arguing that the images show @entity8 " sabotage - reconnaissance groups " acting in @entity1 towns			1
the images , @entity1 officials say , prove organized @entity8 activity in the region			1
@entity2 can not independently confirm the photographs , some of which were first published in the @entity20			0
the dossier shows what @entity1 officials say are images of well - equipped gunmen in eastern @entity1 who look similar to photographs of @entity8 forces taken in @entity27 , @entity8 and during @entity8 's 2008 invasion of @entity29			1
last week , @entity1 security officials told @entity2 they had arrested a @entity8 military officer and a woman @entity1 officials said is a @entity8 intelligence agent			1
@entity33 has disavowed involvement in the takeover of government buildings in eastern @entity1 or other acts by often - masked @entity39 gunmen			1
but the photos , accepted as genuine by the @entity42 administration , appeared to lend credence to allegations by @entity1 officials that @entity8 forces have been dispatched in eastern @entity1 to provoke a military confrontation			1
if genuine , the photos also back up @entity49 leaders who have claimed @entity8 's involvement			2
last week , @entity52 commander gen. @entity51 wrote on the alliance 's blog that what pro-russian groups have described as an organic uprising is in reality a " well - planned and organized " military operation orchestrated by @entity33			0
" there has been broad unity in the international community about the connection between @entity8 and some of the armed militants in eastern @entity1 , and the photos presented by the @entity1 last week only further confirm this , which is why @entity70 officials have continued to make that case , " @entity61 spokesman @entity60 told @entity2 on monday			1
the question of whether @entity8 is involved in the unrest roiling eastern @entity1 is crucial as @entity75 observers try to enforce an agreement reached last week to lower tensions in the region by organizing the withdrawal of forces from government buildings and other facilities			1
officials who brokered the deal in @entity85 said they hoped it would ease tensions			2
but there were some signs monday that tensions are mounting			0
residents told @entity2 that armed militants seized the police station in @entity92 , @entity1 , late monday			1
the police station had been stormed on april 12 before being handed back to local officials two days later			1
amateur video from the scene shows masked , armed men escorting the local police chief to a car after seizing the building			2
the video , in addition to the photos released by @entity1 officials , seemed to show that at least some forces in @entity1 show no sign of backing down			1
@entity1 provided the photos to those observers from the @entity108 , according to the briefing dossier obtained by @entity2 's @entity110			2
one image shows a gunman with a long beard during an assault on a police station in @entity92 who appears similar to a @entity8 special forces member photographed during the @entity8 invasion of @entity29			1
another shows gunmen photographed occupying administrative buildings in @entity0 who appear similar to men pictured in what @entity1 officials described as a " family photo " of a @entity8 sabotage and reconnaissance unit			1
@entity128 , deputy spokeswoman for the @entity108 , declined to comment on the images and referred questions to @entity1 authorities			2
@entity1 maintain that @entity8 involvement in the east is widespread			1
@entity2 has heard @entity8 accents among the " men in green , " as they are known , well armed and uniformed groups who have appeared in towns like @entity0 and @entity92			1
one told @entity2 he had come up from @entity27			0
but @entity2 has not seen any evidence that these men are operating under orders from the @entity144			0
@entity8 's foreign minister scoffed at the accusations , saying that @entity147 and its patrons , the @entity70 and the @entity149 , are trying to blame his country for everything			1
@entity0 's self - declared mayor , a former military man himself , says the explanation is simple : he put out an appeal to his old comrades			0
" when i called on my friends , practically all of whom are ex military , they came to our rescue , not only from @entity8 but also from @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 , " he said			2
but on monday , he insisted there are no active duty @entity8 soldiers in his town			2
diplomatic efforts the government of acting @entity1 president @entity170 has talked tough but done little to curb @entity39 activities in the east , possibly afraid that a crackdown could send @entity8 forces across the border			1
the occupation of buildings continued in about a dozen towns and cities across eastern @entity1			1
international monitors from the @entity108 met monday with @entity39 leaders in @entity0 , but no breakthroughs were reported			0
the monitors were called for in the agreement among @entity8 , the @entity70 and the @entity149 last week that was meant to reduce tensions in the region , which while part of @entity1 has long looked toward @entity8 for cultural and economic ties			1
in three towns , @entity39 protesters and militants have made it clear to @entity2 they have no intention of moving until the " illegal " government in @entity147 also moves out of official buildings			2
@entity8 foreign minister @entity196 echoed those sentiments monday , saying that @entity1 officials were not implementing the agreement negotiated in @entity85 , @entity200			1
" on the contrary , not a single step has been taken by those who have seized power in @entity147 to eliminate the reasons of this deep crisis inside @entity1 , " he said			1
@entity8 has said before that it holds no sway over @entity39 protesters and militants			2
@entity209 , the @entity70 ambassador to @entity1 , told @entity2 's @entity210 on sunday that he has seen progress			2
he had just met with @entity1 foreign minister @entity212 and the ambassador who heads the @entity108 's special monitoring mission , along with his @entity149 and @entity8 counterparts			1
" i think we all reaffirmed today in this setting our collective commitment to trying to make the @entity85 framework a success , " he said on @entity2 's " @entity216			2
" " there are obviously some real challenges at this point , " including the violence in @entity0			0
" but we also believe that there has been some progress			0
i 'm seeing reports this morning that at least one of these ( occupied ) government buildings now has a @entity1 flag flying over it , " he said			2
" and the @entity108 has monitors on the ground who are reaching out , engaging with local political elites , seeing if there 's a way to de-escalate the crisis			0
" there is " no military solution " to the crisis , @entity209 said			0
" it has to be solved through diplomacy			0
" @entity243 visits @entity147 meanwhile , @entity70 vice president @entity243 arrived monday in @entity147 to discuss the situation in eastern @entity1 and deliver a new aid package aimed at shoring up the @entity1 government			1
the bundle includes new economic and energy aid as well as governance assistance , a senior administration official told reporters in a background briefing monday			0
it 's likely to sit well with @entity1 leaders struggling to keep their country going amid widespread financial problems and a growing showdown with @entity8 over that country 's annexation of @entity27 and troubles in @entity1 's @entity39 east			1
on the streets of @entity147 , ordinary citizens said they know there 's only so much the @entity70 can do			0
some said they 'd like to see the @entity70 send troops			0
" our army is very bad			0
maybe the @entity70 can give us some military help , " one @entity1 said			0
but others say that 's too much , even with @entity39 forces occupying government buildings in the east and thousands of @entity8 troops massed along the @entity1 border			1
" i think we want consultations , but no @entity70 troops , " another @entity1 citizen told @entity2			2
@entity70 officials have ruled out the possibility of deploying @entity70 forces to @entity1			0
but some @entity70 lawmakers have argued that the @entity70 should send weapons			0
that would n't help the situation and might make it worse , @entity70 deputy national security adviser @entity285 told @entity2 's " the lead with @entity290 " on monday			0
it wo n't take sending weapons , @entity285 said , to send a message to @entity8			0
" we 've signaled how we can escalate our sanctions , " he said			0
" in the long run , if @entity8 runs this play , they 're going to lose a lot			0
" speaking to @entity2 from @entity147 on monday , rep. @entity300 said the @entity70 needs to do more to reduce @entity1 's reliance on natural gas and oil from @entity8 by exporting fuel there from the @entity70			1
" what has put @entity306 in the driver 's seat over here is the fact that he controls oil and gas			0
he 's got a monopoly on it , " the @entity314 @entity313 said			0
" and that would be something we could upset			0
" defense secretary @entity320 said last week that the @entity70 , however , will continue its beefed - up presence in @entity322 because of the crisis			0
among fellow members of @entity52 , @entity322 has expressed particular concern about @entity8 plans in @entity1			1
the @entity327 is also sending some nonlethal aid to @entity1 security forces , including medical supplies , helmets , shelters and water purification equipment			2
@entity2 's @entity334 , @entity335 , @entity336 , @entity337 , @entity338 , @entity339 and @entity340 contributed to this report .			0
