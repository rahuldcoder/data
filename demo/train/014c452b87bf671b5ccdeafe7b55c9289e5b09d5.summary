-- the @entity2 government has admitted it has 153 people , including children , in custody at sea while it fights a @entity8 challenge to any plans to send them back to @entity10			1
until tuesday 's court hearing in @entity13 , the government had refused to confirm or deny it was holding the suspected asylum seekers , in line with its policy of not commenting on operational matters under " @entity18			1
" all those on board are thought to be tamils who left the @entity23 port of @entity24 on a 72 - foot boat in mid-june			0
they include three - year - old @entity27 , whose image was released by a worried relative who has n't heard from his family for more than a week			0
" i am desperate to know where my family is			0
i ca n't function at all not knowing			0
i know all of them would be in very big trouble if sent back to @entity10 , " he said , via an interpreter to the @entity36 in @entity2 , before tuesday 's hearing			1
the government launched @entity18 last september , a military - led campaign to " stop the boats , " referring to a steady stream of vessels crammed with asylum seekers trying to make it to @entity2 waters			1
critics , including human rights campaigners , have slammed the policy , which advocates " turn - backs " and the offshore processing of asylum claims , as cruel and unnecessary			1
' culture of secrecy ' on tuesday , they also took aim at the " culture of secrecy , " which created days of uncertainty for family members whose relatives were presumably lost at sea , and resulted in a vacuum of official information to back up claims that a boat had gone missing			2
" it took getting a case to the @entity8 before the government would admit that they did have those people in custody and that they were on the high seas , that 's not good enough , " said @entity65 , from the @entity66			2
@entity74 , executive director of the @entity75 ( @entity76 ) , said the government 's silence raised " profound concerns " about whether their rights and @entity2 's obligations under international law were being breached			1
" our system of constitutional democracy is meant to deal with such grave matters with checks and balances under rule of law , not under a government - imposed shroud of secrecy with sweeping assertions that our international obligations are being met when the circumstances strongly suggest they are , in fact , being breached , " he told @entity0			2
@entity98 senator @entity97 said : " the ugly truth is that the government has been keeping dozens of children detained out on the high seas			0
these families have been at sea for over three weeks ; they are anxious and frightened			0
" the government has shown total contempt for the truth and for the rights of the @entity2 people to know what is being done in their name			1
thankfully the courts have been able to shed some light on this immoral behavior , " she added			0
why was the matter before the @entity8 ? on tuesday , lawyers acting for 50 passengers on board the boat -- including 21 women and eight children from as young as two years old -- were seeking to extend a 24 - hour injunction granted monday to stop the @entity2 government from handing them over to @entity10 authorities			1
fears they would be returned to face potential persecution intensified earlier monday when the government confirmed it had on sunday returned 41 @entity10 nationals found aboard a boat west of the @entity130 in late june			1
according to a statement from @entity2 immigration minister @entity133 , 38 @entity131 and four tamil @entity10 had been subject to an " enhanced screening process " at sea			1
it found only one @entity131 @entity10 had a possible case for refugee status , but that person had asked to return with the others , the statement said			2
human rights advocates said evaluating asylum seekers at sea was not an appropriate way to deal with serious claims			1
" it sounds as though three or four or five questions are being asked by video conference , snap judgments are being ( made ) , and they 're simply being returned , " said @entity146 , president of the @entity147			0
" there is an obligation with international law to have a proper process , " she added			0
in a statement , the @entity156 high commissioner for refugees ( @entity156 ) said , " @entity156 's experience over the years with shipboard processing has generally not been positive			0
such an would rarely afford an appropriate venue for a fair procedure			0
" on tuesday , the returned @entity10 faced court in the city of @entity164 , charged with illegally departing the country			2
what does the government say ? the government has repeatedly defended @entity18 as the only way to put people smugglers out of business and to prevent lives being lost at sea			0
in a radio interview last week , immigration minister @entity133 said : " i know there 's a lot of people out there who feel uncomfortable about elements of this , i get that ... but this is how you stop the boats			0
this is how it has to be done because this is what works			0
this is why we 're sticking to it			0
" ministers often refer to the 1,200 people thought to have been lost at sea while trying to make the dangerous journey through seas to @entity2 during the previous @entity200 government 's tenure			1
the @entity202 government boasts that not one person has drowned in the 202 days since the last successful people smuggling venture arrived in @entity2			2
in a statement on tuesday , acting immigration minister @entity205 said : " the government provided the @entity8 with the information it requested			2
however , in accordance with the policy established by the @entity212 , the government will not provide commentary about on - water matters under @entity18			2
" " the government will act in accordance with undertakings made before the @entity8 , " she added			2
@entity8 ruling on tuesday , the government agreed to give 72 hours ' written notice before any move to hand the asylum seekers back to @entity10			1
lawyers for the government revealed for the first time that the boat had been intercepted in @entity2 's contiguous zone , the area stretching beyond its territorial waters			1
because the boat was not in @entity2 waters , the people on board were not able to seek protection under the country 's @entity237 , the court heard			2
however , the presiding judge , justice @entity239 , said there was no barrier to the government moving the asylum seekers to another location for processing , presumably one of its two controversial offshore processing centers on @entity247 in @entity248 or @entity249			1
how did advocates know about the boat ? until tuesday , most of the details known about the boat and those on board came from the vessel itself			0
on thursday , someone claiming to be a passenger called a well - known human rights advocate			1
" we 're on our way to @entity2 , " the caller said , according to @entity263 from the @entity2 @entity264 , which represents the country 's @entity266 community			0
the caller said the boat had left the @entity23 port of @entity24 , with 153 people on board , all @entity266 , including women and children			0
other phone calls were made before communication with the boat suddenly ceased on saturday morning , @entity263 said , who passed the information to local media who called the @entity284 ( @entity284 )			0
asked how he thought the asylum seekers might be feeling about being held , @entity263 said : " the only thing i can think of is they 'd be very happy			1
why not ? not all of them know the government policy ( of offshore processing ) , some of them might			1
" but , at the end of the day , they would think ' if we prove we are real refugees then the government will take us			0
' that 's the mindset everyone has , is n't it ? " the @entity2 government has been returning asylum seekers to @entity10 , a country @entity2 prime minister @entity302 has said is " at peace " , despite reports of the abuse and mistreatment of @entity266 since the end of the civil war in 2009			1
