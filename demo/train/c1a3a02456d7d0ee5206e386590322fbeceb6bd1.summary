@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 on wednesday proposed a package of measures that would provide at least $ 58 million in additional funding for oil spill relief efforts and raise the tax that oil companies pay to maintain an emergency fund			1
in a letter to house speaker @entity12 requesting congressional approval of the package , @entity3 said oil giant @entity15 -- which owns the leaking well in the @entity16 -- was responsible for all cleanup costs			1
in addition , @entity3 said , the government would seek full compensation for all damages from @entity15			1
" we can not allow the potentially protracted pursuit of claims to prevent us from swift action to help those harmed by this spill , " @entity3 said in the letter			2
the proposals would increase by 1 cent the current tax of 8 cents a barrel that oil companies pay into the @entity32 , and also increase the amounts that could be spent from that fund on single incidents			0
efforts to staunch the gusher continued wednesday			0
the " top - hat " oil containment device has reached the sea floor and should be in position over the wellhead and operational by the end of the week , @entity15 said			1
a larger containment vessel was unsuccessful in stopping the flow of oil from the gusher about 5,000 feet underwater			0
the spill is sending 210,000 gallons of crude into the @entity16 each day			2
the " top - hat " cofferdam , a 5 - foot - tall , 4 - foot - diameter structure , weighs less than 2 tons			1
the structure was deployed by the drill ship enterprise			0
@entity15 built the smaller dome after a much larger , four - story containment vessel , designed to cap the larger of two leaks in the well , developed glitches saturday			1
ice - like hydrate crystals formed when gas combined with water and blocked the top of the dome , making it buoyant			2
the new device would keep most of the water out at the beginning of the capping process and would allow engineers to pump in methanol to keep the hydrates from forming , said @entity70 , @entity15 's chief operating officer for exploration and production			1
methanol is a simple alcohol that can be used as an antifreeze			0
secretary of the interior @entity76 said the success of this latest attempt to cap the well could be known in the next few days			1
" on this thursday , we should know whether or not this alternative top - hat cofferdam is going to work , " @entity76 said on @entity2 's " @entity81			1
" " and then the next key date is saturday , because by saturday they will have the diagnostics completed through x-rays and gamma rays and pressure ratings to be able to make decisions about what the next steps are			0
" if attempts to cap the well fail , @entity15 may try to plug the leak by shooting debris -- shredded tires , golf balls and similar objects -- under extremely high pressure into the well 's blowout preventer in an attempt to clog it and stop the leak			1
the blowout preventer has been partially successful in sealing the well , but did not fully close when the rig exploded and sank			0
@entity70 said @entity15 also is drilling a relief well to try to divert the flow to another pipe			2
" that started about a week ago , " @entity70 said			0
the well is at about 9,000 feet			0
" it may take up to three months to reach the target area , and progress will slow the deeper the drill bit goes , said @entity116 , executive vice president of @entity15			2
federal investigators are still trying to determine what caused the explosion that sank the @entity120 , which was owned by @entity15 contractor @entity121 the oil rig exploded april 20 and sank two days later , about 50 miles off the southeast coast of @entity1			1
@entity15 is legally required to cover economic damages from the spill up to $ 75 million			1
but @entity127 sen. @entity126 has introduced legislation that would raise the liability cap to $ 10 billion			0
@entity130 : share images from the @entity16 " if this gusher continues for several months , it 's going to cover up the @entity134 and it 's going to get down into the loop current , and that 's going to take it down the @entity138 and up the east coast of @entity127 , " @entity126 said sunday on @entity2 's " @entity139			2
" and you are talking about massive economic loss to our tourism , our beaches , to our fisheries , very possibly disruption of our military testing and training , " he said			0
@entity2 's @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
