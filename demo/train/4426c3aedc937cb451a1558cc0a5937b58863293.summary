following is a transcript of @entity1 's opening statement : chairman [ @entity22 ] @entity21 , [ @entity23 ] , @entity26 [ @entity25 ] @entity24 , [ @entity27 ] , members of the committee , my name is @entity28 , and i am the chairman and ceo of the @entity1 and @entity3			1
@entity3 's a team of dedicated professionals who provide training to @entity32 's military and law enforcement communities and risk their lives to protect @entity32 in harm 's way overseas			1
under the direction and oversight of the @entity32 government , @entity3 provides an opportunity for military and law enforcement veterans with a record of honorable service to continue their support to the @entity32			1
words alone can not express the respect i have for these brave men and women who defend -- who volunteer to defend @entity32 personnel facilities and diplomatic missions			2
i am proud to be there to represent them today			0
after almost five years in active service as a @entity55 , i founded @entity3 in 1997			1
i wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world - class training venues			0
ten years later , @entity3 trains approximately 500 members of the @entity32 military and law enforcement agencies every day			1
after 9/11 , when the @entity32 began its stabilization efforts in @entity64 and then @entity14 , the @entity32 government called upon @entity3 to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas			1
we are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country			0
@entity3 personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans , many of whom have recent military deployments			1
no individual ever protected by @entity3 has ever been killed or seriously injured			1
there is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men			0
at the same time , 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for @entity3 and its affiliates			1
numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed			0
the entire @entity3 family mourns the loss of these brave lives			1
our thoughts and our prayers are with their families			0
the areas of @entity14 in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging			0
@entity3 personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within @entity14			1
we 're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 @entity32 military personnel and thousands of innocent @entity14			0
any incident where @entity32 are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep @entity32 officials and dignitaries safe , including visiting members of @entity108			0
in doing so , more @entity32 service members are available to fight the enemy			0
@entity3 shares the committee 's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting @entity32 operations			1
the company 's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes , treaties and regulations of the @entity32			0
@entity3 looks forward to working with @entity108 and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented			2
the worldwide personnel protection services contract , which has been provided to this committee , was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance , including the hiring , vetting guidelines , background checks , screening , training standards , rules of force and conduct standards			0
in @entity14 , @entity3 reports to the embassy 's regional security officer , or @entity142			2
all @entity3 movements and operations are directed by the @entity142			2
in conjunction with internal company procedures and controls , the @entity142 ensures that @entity3 complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions , as well as any applicable laws and regulations			2
we have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in @entity14 as part of our nation 's total force			0
@entity3 does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions			2
my understanding of the september 16 incident is that the @entity162 and the @entity9 are conducting a full investigation , but those results are not yet available			2
we at @entity3 welcome the @entity9 review announced yesterday , and we will cooperate fully and look forward to receiving their conclusions			1
i just want to put some other things in perspective			0
a recent report from the @entity162 stated that in 2007 @entity3 conducted 1,873 security details for diplomatic visits to the red zone , areas outside the @entity175 in @entity14 , and there have been only 56 incidences in which weapons were discharged , or less than 3 percent of all movements			2
in 2006 , @entity3 conducted over 6,500 diplomatic movements in the @entity181			2
weapons were discharged in less than 1 percent of those missions			0
to the extent there is any loss of innocent life , ever , let me be clear that i consider that tragic			0
every life , whether @entity32 or @entity14 , is precious			0
i stress to the committee and to the @entity32 public , however , that i believe we acted appropriately at all times			1
i am prepared to answer your questions			0
