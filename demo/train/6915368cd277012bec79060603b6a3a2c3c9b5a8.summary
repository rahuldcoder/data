-- three officials in a @entity7 suburb whose high salaries sparked statewide outrage will step down from their jobs , the city 's mayor said friday			1
@entity10 , the mayor of @entity11 , @entity12 , said the @entity13 accepted the resignations of city manager @entity15 , assistant city manager @entity17 , and police chief @entity18 , who reportedly had a combined salary of more than $ 1.6 million			1
he added that the three will not get severance pay			0
" today , our city council took the quick and decisive action that is in the best interest of our city so that we may return our attention to delivering outstanding city services , " the mayor said in a statement posted on the city clerk 's website			2
" we recognize that today 's economic climate and the financial hardships so many families are suffering put our past compensation decisions in a new light			0
to the residents of @entity11 , we apologize			0
we are confident that your pride in our great city endures and that the city 's financial health and superior public services demonstrate that our priorities remain intact			2
" but @entity10 also praised @entity46 and called the @entity48 story and the resulting uproar that led to the resignations " unfair and unwarranted			2
" the salaries have infuriated many in @entity12			0
@entity53 , @entity12 's attorney general , issued a statement thursday saying that his office had launched a investigation into the salaries			1
the @entity48 reported that @entity46 had an annual salary of nearly $ 800,000 a year , " making him the highest - paid city manager in the state			1
" citing the newspaper , @entity53 's statement said @entity18 had an annual salary of $ 457,000 and @entity17 received $ 376,288 a year			1
" most city council members are paid nearly $ 100,000 for their part - time jobs , " the attorney general said			1
" these outrageous salaries in @entity11 are shocking and beyond belief , " he said			2
" with record deficits and painful budget cuts facing @entity12 cities , astronomical local government salaries raise serious questions and demand a thorough investigation			0
" " it 's shocking			0
how did they get it ? " @entity78 , a resident of the city , said to @entity0 affiliate @entity80			0
" they 're making more than the president -- it 's totally not fair , " @entity12 assemblyman @entity84 , who represents the district that encompasses @entity11 , also voiced outrage			0
" the city council salaries and the outrageous salaries for the staff have really riled up the community , " he told @entity0 recently			2
" ... it 's a working class community			0
they 're busy just trying to survive in this tough economic climate			0
" @entity84 said the median yearly income in the southern @entity12 town is under $ 35,000 a year			1
" just to put it in context , the general fund for the city of @entity11 is $ 15 million			1
so , mr. @entity46 with his salary and compensation package , around $ 800,000 is about one - fifteenth of the budget for the city of @entity11 , " @entity84 said			1
" and mr. @entity46 is obviously a little delusional about what the private sector would be ( able ) to pay anybody , certainly not $ 800,000			1
certainly not double what the president of the @entity108 " makes			0
in his statement , @entity10 said the @entity48 ' " coverage and the contrived uproar the @entity48 sought to provoke are unfair and unwarranted " and praised @entity46			2
@entity10 said the salaries " have been in line with similar positions over the period of their tenure " and that @entity46 gave the town 15 years of balanced budgets after a $ 20 million shortfall			1
" while other cities are defaulting on their commitments , borrowing to maintain city services or even threatening bankruptcy , @entity11 has a healthy surplus that has enabled us to ride out the nation 's fiscal storm and even expand services to meet the growing needs of our low - income residents through the city food bank and programs for youth and seniors			2
" while other municipalities are shuttering their libraries and shutting down their parks and services , @entity11 's parents know their children have access to services and activities that keep them safe -- especially during the summer months when school is out and working parents are not at home during the day			0
" @entity10 appointed @entity148 , assistant to the city manager , to be the interim city manager			1
" we acknowledge that the actions taken today are not a panacea , but a first step towards healing our city and getting back to business that ensures the safety and well - being of our residents , " the mayor said .			0
