-- a woman who claims polygamist sect leader @entity2 forced her as a 14 - year - old to marry her 19 - year - old cousin said she is not giving up , despite the @entity6 's overturning @entity2 ' convictions and ordering a new trial			1
" this is not the end , and i by no means am backing down , " @entity9 said after the ruling at a news conference , portions of which were posted on the website of @entity0 affiliate @entity15			1
@entity2 , the " prophet " of the @entity19 , or @entity19 , was sentenced to two consecutive terms of five years to life after he was convicted on two counts of rape as an accomplice in september 2007			1
he was accused of using his influence to force @entity9 to marry her cousin @entity27 in 2001			2
the @entity6 ruled wednesday that the jury instructions in @entity2 ' 2007 trial were flawed			1
the first count of rape as an accomplice against @entity2 was alleged to have occurred shortly after @entity9 and @entity27 were married , when the two first had sex , the @entity6 opinion said			1
the second was alleged to have occurred after @entity2 refused to " release " @entity9 from her marriage and told her to " give herself to [ @entity38 ] ... mind , body and soul			1
" prosecutors relied on three separate portions of the law defining the circumstances under which sex is non-consensual , the opinion said			0
under those portions , the victim must express a lack of consent through words or conduct , the victim must be younger than 18 , and " the actor " must be in a position of special trust in relation to the victim			0
" @entity2 argues that the instruction erroneously focused the jury on @entity2 ' actions and position of special trust , rather than on @entity27 's , for the purpose of determining whether @entity9 consented , " the opinion said			1
the justices agreed , saying in the unanimous ruling that the jurors should have been asked to consider whether @entity27 was in a position of special trust and whether @entity27 lured or induced @entity9 into having sex			2
" the state interprets the term ' actor ' to mean the ' defendant , ' " the opinion said			0
" we conclude that the state 's interpretation is erroneous			0
" also , the jurors should have been instructed that in order to convict , they must find that @entity2 intended that @entity27 would sexually assault @entity9 as a result of his conduct			1
@entity9 told " @entity84 " on tuesday night that she was in " disbelief " after hearing that the convictions were overturned			1
" what i know is this : i would never have married my first husband unless @entity2 wanted it , " she said			2
" i would never had had unwanted sex with my first husband unless @entity2 demanded it			2
" she told @entity15 that she has no regrets about her testimony in the case			0
" if i had to do this again , i would n't change a thing , because i stood up for what i believe in , " @entity9 said tuesday			1
she is now 24 and has remarried and left the @entity19			0
her attorneys made her name public after the @entity2 trial , with her consent			2
according to @entity15 , she is in a witness protection program			0
she said she feared retribution for her testimony against @entity2			2
" he controlled thousands of people in fear for many , many years , " she said , and " many abominable sins and many things ... have occurred to thousands of people because of his influence			0
" the justices sent the case back to the lower court for a new trial			0
defense attorney @entity116 said tuesday that he expects the @entity118 , @entity119 , district attorney to decide quickly on whether @entity2 will be retried			1
@entity120 , senior deputy attorney for @entity118 , said wednesday that the district attorney 's office is still analyzing the @entity6 's ruling and consulting with the victim and others involved in the case before deciding to retry @entity2			1
@entity2 will be transferred , however , from the @entity127 just south of @entity128 to @entity118 in southern @entity119 -- closer to the @entity19 communities of @entity130 , @entity119 , and @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity116 said			1
@entity116 said tuesday that he will be requesting bail for @entity2 when a hearing is held in the lower court			2
but @entity2 remains under federal indictment for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution in 2006			2
federal detainers remain in place , said @entity141 , spokeswoman for the @entity144 attorney 's office in @entity119			2
if @entity2 is not held on state charges , he will be taken into federal custody , she said			1
however , @entity2 ' biggest legal challenge still awaits him			2
he is awaiting trial in @entity149 , where he was indicted in 2008 on a felony charge of sexual assault of a child			0
the indictment accuses him of assaulting a child " younger than 17 years of age and not legally married to the defendant " in january 2005			0
if convicted on those charges , he could face a maximum penalty of five to 99 years or life in prison			0
an extradition hearing on the @entity149 matter was canceled tuesday after the @entity6 ruling			1
but the @entity149 attorney general 's office began new proceedings wednesday to extradite @entity2 , spokesman @entity164 told the @entity167			1
@entity2 had been awaiting trial in @entity132 on four charges of being an accomplice to sexual conduct with a minor			1
but last month , a judge dismissed those charges			0
the @entity175 , @entity132 , prosecutor , had asked the court to throw out the charges , citing " much more serious charges " against @entity2 in @entity149 and the desire of his alleged victims that he " face these more serious charges as soon as possible			1
" the @entity19 drew national attention when @entity2 was arrested during a routine traffic stop in august 2006			0
at the time , he was on the @entity186 's @entity185			0
the @entity19 is a 10,000 - member offshoot of the mainstream @entity189 church , which renounced polygamy a century ago			0
@entity19 members openly practice polygamy at the @entity193 in @entity194 , @entity149 , and the two towns straddling the @entity119 - @entity132 state line			1
critics of the sect say young girls are forced into " spiritual " marriages with older men and are sexually abused			0
sect members have denied that any sexual abuse takes place			0
@entity2 had led the sect since his father 's death in 2002			0
@entity0 's @entity208 and " @entity84 's " @entity209 contributed to this report .			0
