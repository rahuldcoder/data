-- from his neatly - trimmed goatee to his love of fast cars and flight , it 's not hard to see why @entity8 industrialist @entity7 is often referred to as his country 's @entity9			1
he 's immensely rich and is frequently photographed at lavish events promoting his @entity13 brand as a lifestyle choice for @entity8 's younger , mobile middle classes			1
like @entity9 , @entity7 's stable of businesses also includes an airline -- @entity13 -- which risks nose - diving into a sea of debt unless the billionaire can cut costs and lighten its loans			1
on tuesday , @entity7 said recent flight cancellations reflected the airline 's move out of loss - making routes and should not be interpreted as a sign of impending doom , despite a doubling of the airline 's second quarter losses announced earlier in the day			1
who is @entity7 ? the fast - living playboy son of one of @entity8 's most successful industrialists was just 28 when he took over the chairmanship of his father 's massive beer company in the early 1980s			1
" everybody thought that i 'd fritter away what i had inherited			0
but i was determined to prove people wrong , " @entity7 told @entity0 in 2007			2
@entity45 is now one of the world 's biggest brewers			0
it holds about half of the market share for beer in @entity8 and claims that every single one of the country 's tens of thousands of beer outlets stocks at least one of its brands			1
@entity58 is also sold in 52 countries worldwide			0
but @entity45 is about much more than beer			0
as well as @entity13 , the holding company includes the world 's biggest spirits group , @entity63 , as well as interests in the fertilizer business , engineering , property and broadcasting			1
of all its brands , @entity13 is the most iconic			2
it 's the name of a discontinued beer label that the young @entity7 stumbled upon when he was going through the @entity45 archives after his father bought the company in 1947			1
" something excited me about @entity13 , you know , the bird			2
i saw color , i saw vibrancy , i saw movement , i saw a bit of cheekiness , you know , the kingfisher sort of fishing , " @entity7 said			2
he revived the beer and later put the bird on the tail of @entity13 , which was launched in 2005 and has so far failed to fly into profit			2
what 's up with the airline ? results released tuesday show the airline 's second quarter net loss doubled to 4.69 billion rupees ( $ 93 million )			2
revenue rose 11 % as the company sought to cut costs , but it was nowhere near enough to deal with the airline 's reported debt of 65 billion rupees ( $ 1.3b )			1
anxious investors have been ditching @entity13 shares , prompting the company to deny on november 11 that it had sought government aid			2
it admitted it had asked banks to raise its lending limits , but added that " @entity13 does not see any risk to its future or long term viability			2
" flights have been canceled as the company tries desperately to reduce operating costs inflated by rising fuel prices			1
the cuts have angered travelers as well as employees whose pay was delayed			0
despite soaring costs , @entity8 airlines have been slashing fares to compete with discount prices offered by state - owned @entity123			1
@entity13 has also invested heavily in the future , ordering five @entity125 , the first of which is due to be delivered in 2016			0
is it just @entity13 ? despite a huge rise in the number of @entity8 taking to the skies , the extra traffic has failed to translate into profits			1
private airlines are engaged in a price war with @entity123 , which is being propped up by government funds			0
@entity123 is reported to have asked for another 65 billion rupees ( $ 1.3b ) in federal aid , and to have agreed with lenders to cut its annual interest payments by 13 billion rupees , according to @entity138			0
@entity139 is also reported to be seeking to raise up to $ 350 million from the sale and leaseback of aircraft this quarter and other asset sales , according to @entity144			0
the industry 's struggles come despite impressive figures for passenger growth			0
according to the @entity149 , @entity8 had the fastest growing domestic airline market as of september 2011 , recording year - on - year growth of 18.4 %			1
strong growth is expected to continue as the country 's young population becomes wealthier and takes advantage of the fierce competition for their cash			0
outside @entity8 , high fuel prices are also taking their toll on the global airline industry			1
the @entity162 expects the industry to make just $ 4 billion profit in 2011 , down 78 % from the figure of $ 18 billion recorded in 2010			0
what does @entity13 plan to do ? hours after announcing the second quarter loss , @entity7 again insisted the company was not seeking a government bailout			1
" we have never done it , we will never do it , " he said			0
he said the company had asked its lenders to help with its short - term capital needs and for concessions on interest repayments			0
quoting @entity45 's chief financial officer , @entity179 reported that the airline would launch a rights issue of up to 20 billion rupees ( $ 398m ) sometime before march 2013			0
as one of @entity8 's richest men , @entity7 has plenty of financial clout behind him			1
as well as dominating the drinks industry , he 's a familiar face in the world of sport			0
he sponsors @entity8 's @entity192 team , @entity191 , and owns a cricket team in the @entity194			1
his garages house some 200 vintage cars and he owns the luxury @entity198 shopping mall in @entity200 , which is filled with top - notch @entity202 brands including @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205			0
it 's on a street named after @entity7 's father , @entity209			2
further down the street , you 'll find @entity211 , " a super luxury residential project " boasting 75 flats and a rooftop helipad			0
the troubles at @entity13 mark a low point for the flamboyant billionaire , who is often referred to as the " @entity218 "			2
it remains to be seen whether @entity7 's airline can ride out these rough times and stay in the air			1
@entity7 certainly believes it can .			0
