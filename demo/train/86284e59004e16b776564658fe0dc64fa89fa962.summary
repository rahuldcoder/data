the @entity2 administration monday announced a goal of accelerating changes to @entity5 so that within four years , half the program 's traditional spending will go to doctors , hospitals and other providers that coordinate their patient care , stressing quality and frugality			1
the announcement by @entity16 secretary @entity15 is intended to spur efforts to supplant @entity5 's traditional fee - for - service medicine , in which doctors , hospitals and other medical providers are paid for each case or service without regard to how the patient fares			1
@entity5 is the federal insurance program that provides health care to the elderly			1
since the passage of the @entity31 in 2010 , the administration has been designing new programs and underwriting experiments to come up with alternate payment models			0
last year , 20 % of traditional @entity5 spending , about $ 72 billion , went to models such as accountable care organizations , or @entity39 , where doctors and others band together to care for patients with the promise of getting a piece of any savings they bring to @entity5 , administration officials said			1
there are now 424 @entity48 , and 105 hospitals and other health care groups that accept bundled payments , where @entity5 gives them a fixed sum for each patient , which is supposed to cover not only the initial treatment for a specific ailment but also all the follow - up care			1
we need to rethink dying other @entity5 - funded pilot projects give doctors extra money to coordinate patient care among specialists and seek to get @entity5 to work more in harmony with @entity66 , the state - federal health insurer for low - income people			1
@entity15 's targets are for 30 % , or about $ 113 billion , of @entity5 's traditional spending to go to these kind of endeavors by the end of president @entity2 's term in 2016 , and 50 % , about $ 215 billion , to be spent by the end of 2018			1
the administration also wants @entity5 spending with any quality component , such as bonuses and penalties on top of traditional fee - for - service payments , to increase , so that by the end of 2018 , 90 % of @entity5 spending has some sort of link to quality			1
these figures do not include the money that now goes to private insurers in the @entity90 program , which enrolls about a third of all @entity5 beneficiaries			2
monday 's announcement did not include any new policies or funding to encourage providers , but @entity15 said setting a concrete goal alone would prompt changes not only in @entity5 but also in private insurance , where some of these alternative models are also being tried			1
@entity101 , a consulting firm , counts 317 commercial acos and 40 in the @entity66 program			0
@entity104 " for the first time we 're actually going to set clear goals and establish a clear timeline for moving from volume to value in the @entity5 system , " @entity15 said at an announcement at the department 's headquarters , where she was joined by leading physicians and leaders from the insurance and hospital industries			1
" so today what we want to do is measure our progress and we want to hold ourselves in the federal government accountable			0
" some providers have eagerly embraced the new payment models , with success			0
roughly a quarter of @entity48 saved @entity5 enough money to win bonuses last year			2
others are wary , particularly since they could lose money if they fall short on either saving @entity5 money or achieving the dozens of quality benchmarks the government has established			2
" acos are quite expensive to set up , " said @entity134 , a program officer at the @entity135 , a @entity136 charity that is funding research into @entity48 performance			0
" there 's a significant upfront investment and if you 're not sure you 're going to make it back , there 's a pause			0
" in the largest @entity48 experiment , the @entity146 , 53 @entity48 saved enough money in 2013 to get bonuses from the government , but 41 spent more than the government estimated they should have			0
transgender woman feels ' complete ' thanks to @entity31 those @entity48 did not have to repay any money , but in future years @entity5 intends to require reimbursements from those who fall short			2
providers have been pushing @entity5 to increase the cut they get from these programs and lessen the financial risks in @entity48 and the other programs			0
" @entity168 needs to do more to make sure there 's more shared savings going back to the providers , " said @entity162 , an executive with @entity163 , a company that assists hospitals and providers in establishing acos and other models			0
it is still too early to know whether these alternate payment models improve health of patients and whether the savings that have been achieved so far , often by focusing on the most expensive patients , will plateau			0
studies on the success of these programs have shown mixed results			0
" we still have very little evidence about which payment methods are going to be successful in getting the results we want , which are better quality care and more affordable care , " said @entity180 , executive director of @entity181 , a @entity182 - based nonprofit that has been tracking the spread of alternative payment models in the private sector			2
" we 're just wanting to avoid a situation where a few years from now , where we 've completely gotten rid of fee - for - service , " @entity180 said			1
" we do n't want to wake up and say , ' oh my gosh , we did it and we 're no better off			0

@entity2 administration plan to *redirect* spending to health care provides that stress quality , frugality
the plan would change @entity5 's traditional fee - for - service strategy
