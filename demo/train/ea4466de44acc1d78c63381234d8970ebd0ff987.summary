-- " i went through a few roller coasters , " says @entity3 , reflecting on her relationships over the past two years			1
she channeled the turmoil into her fourth studio @entity6 , " @entity7 , " out october 22			1
" trying to chronicle each step of the way was challenging , because you go to some really dark places with the lyrics			0
then in the next track , you 're talking about how amazing it is to meet somebody new			0
" after writing 2010 's smash " @entity22 " by herself , @entity3 veered in the opposite direction , co-writing with pop hitmakers such as @entity19 and @entity21 collaborator @entity20			1
she wound up with nearly 40 potential songs ; in between stops on the yearlong world tour that she wrapped in march , @entity3 joined her writing partners in @entity28 and @entity29			2
" i felt like an apprentice , " @entity3 says			2
" they taught me so much about melodic sense , and they let me do what i love , which is the lyrics			0
" the result is @entity3 's most eclectic set ever , ranging from " @entity41 , " a howling , @entity44 - style epic with reverb - drenched guitars , to a sweet acoustic duet with @entity40 singer @entity39			1
another key track even features a dubstep - inspired bass breakdown			2
so far , the new direction is n't hurting @entity3 's career : @entity54 , " a bitter breakup anthem with a hip - hop - flavored @entity19 beat , has shattered chart records , selling a stunning 623,000 digital singles in its first week			1
@entity3 to @entity55 in october to @entity3 , the musical excursions are n't surprising , given how much hip - hop and r&b she listens to			1
" i have so many play - lists full of @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , " she says			2
" lyrically , the album is full of @entity3 's usual themes of romance and heartbreak			1
" i know general things about love , " she says			0
" how to treat people well , what you deserve and when to walk away			0
other than that , love is a complete mystery -- and that 's why i like to write about it			2
" @entity3 : my fourth album is about ' @entity81 ' @entity3 has spent much of the summer with her new boyfriend , @entity82 ( the son of @entity84 ) , in @entity85 , @entity86			1
she 's even looked into buying a house near the @entity84 compound			0
" that would be so amazing , " she says			0
but @entity3 wo n't be resting for long : she 's already thinking about how to top her last tour , which featured aerialists , costume changes and a mock wedding onstage every night			1
" i really want to go out on the road in the spring , " she says			0
" after i write a song , i always end up laying awake at night thinking , ' what are the lighting cues going to be on this ? how big is the pit going to be ? ' i have been thinking of some big moments that are going to happen			0
