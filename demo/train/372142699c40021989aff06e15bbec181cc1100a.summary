-- when @entity2 lines up at the start gates in @entity4 later this month , she will do so with form and , perhaps , the fates in her favor			1
as the reigning women 's ski cross world champion , the 21 - year - old will be one of the favorites for gold , but it 's a minor miracle that she is racing at all			1
in december 2011 , at the start of the @entity18 season , the @entity15 athlete suffered a serious knee injury			1
" i broke everything -- my mcl ( medial collateral ligament ) , @entity25 ( lateral collateral ligament ) , two meniscus in the front of the knee , " she told @entity0 's human to @entity21			2
there was worse news to come when the knee surgeon walked into her room following the operation			2
" he said , ' @entity2 , i think you ca n't ski anymore			1
i think racing is finished for you , " she recalls			0
it was a brutal assessment , but it did n't deter @entity2 -- who used it as the catalyst for the start of a remarkable recovery			1
" i was so upset			0
but in my head i said to myself , ' you will see next year and shut your mouth ! ' " eleven long months followed but , with the help of staff at the @entity48 , @entity2 's defied her doctor 's predictions , returning to action with renewed vigor at the start of the 2012 - 13 season			1
" everybody says , after an injury you become more strong			2
after my injury was the best season of my life , " she says			2
@entity2 won the first three races of the year and four overall			2
with a total of six podiums from 10 starts , she cruised to her first ski cross @entity18 title before capping her incredible comeback with gold at the world championships in @entity72 , @entity73 last march			1

but to win the other cup , the @entity81 ( the prize for the top ranked ski cross racer throughout a season ) , it 's like you 've been carrying on your good races , race after race			1
so it 's more satisfying , " she says			0
child 's play ski cross -- a madcap race between four skiers over a narrow 1,000 - meter course containing turns , jumps and bumps -- made its debut at the @entity102 , seven years after it became an official @entity104 discipline			1
" i 'm not old , but it feels like when you are a kid and you race your friends to the car -- the first to this , the first to that			0
in ski cross , it 's actually completely that , it 's who comes down first , " @entity2 says			1
she strapped on her first set of skis at the age of two , growing up on the slopes of @entity121 and @entity122 in the @entity123 , and tried ski cross for the first time when she was 12			1
" i fell in love with the sport , " she says			0
" it was the perfect combination of what i like -- alpine spirit and freestyle			0
you have so many things to do			0
" are your kids potential future olympians ? send us your pictures in 2006 , aged 14 , she won a place at a @entity15 sports school in @entity140 -- a popular destination with winter sport athletes -- and it was n't long before she began seriously thinking about becoming a professional ski crosser			1
" the first time i actually decided i wanted to ski cross was at a race in @entity15			1
it was the day ( november 28 , 2006 ) that ski cross was accepted into the @entity76 in @entity149 , " she says			1
" ( me and my dad ) were up in a gondola and he asked me , ' @entity2 , do you want to go to the @entity76 ? ' so , like a young kid , i was like , ' yes ! i want to go , ' but you do n't really know what it means			2
" @entity15 had a ski cross team at that time but it was impossible for @entity2 to commit full time			1
" i was almost the youngest girl to start ski cross -- they could n't carry me			1
i had no driving license and my parents worked so they could n't drive me everywhere , " she said			0
@entity4 : the numbers game @entity167 , her father set about finding sponsors and a trainer , and by the time she was 16 @entity2 was part of the @entity15 national team			1
a year later in 2009 , she entered her first @entity18 race			2
it was n't all plain sailing			0
" i broke a tooth so , you know , it was fun			0
i was laughing and i was like so happy with a big smile			0
my dad said , ' are you okay ' and i was like , ' yes ! i love it ! i want to continue			0
" with her gleaming smile restored , @entity2 did n't have to wait long before she had secured her first podium			2
a second place at a @entity18 event in @entity187 in january 2010 was followed by a maiden victory at @entity189 , @entity190 the following december			2
in between those results , a 17 - year - old @entity2 skied to a seventh place finish in @entity149 -- but fast forward four years and she will be gunning for gold at @entity194 when the women 's ski cross starts on february 21			1
" i think the big pressure is from the media and your country and after for me , " she says			0
" i 'm just trying to , you know , be myself , enjoy the present moment of being in the @entity76 and do my best			0
" surprisingly , for someone who has spent half a lifetime up a mountain , she draws inspiration from a sporting hero who hails from lower altitudes			0
" i really like the spirit of @entity211			2
it 's not because he 's @entity15 , it 's just because i think it is so incredible how he can be at the top and be so good for a long time and have not so much injury , " she says			2
" he needs to know his body so well			0
when he 's old he will have a good body and not be in pain			0
so , i think he 's someone who 's done everything right			0
" much like the great tennis champion , @entity2 , it seems , manages to combine a competitive edge -- " i like to win " -- with a more relaxed outlook on life away from the frantic twists and turns of the ski cross circuit			1
" i try to always be positive , " she says			0
" just live your life 100 % and have no regrets			0
