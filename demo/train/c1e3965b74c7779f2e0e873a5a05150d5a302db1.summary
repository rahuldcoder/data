@entity0 -- they never got to run their race because of @entity6 , but @entity8 entrants can now at least recoup their entry fee , organizers of the marquee 26 - mile test of human endurance said thursday			1
citing " extraordinary circumstances , " the @entity11 organization is offering runners the option of getting a full refund of their entry fee			1
entry fees for the canceled 2012 race varied from $ 216 for members of the @entity11 and $ 255 for non-members to $ 347 for runners from outside the @entity22			1
the refund offer exclude an $ 11 processing fee , race organizers said			1
race organizers also offered two other options -- a guaranteed place in the always - crowded field for the @entity8 one year during the next three years , or guaranteed entry into the @entity31 in march			1
but in those cases , runners would not get back their fees for this year 's race and they would have to pay fees for whichever future race they chose			2
runners vented frustrations about the latter two options on the marathon 's @entity42 page , complaining that they unfairly created a one - race - for - two - fees deal			2
meanwhile , @entity45 , captain of the @entity38 , told @entity1 the offers by marathon organizers gave runners " a decent range of options to choose from			0
" the situation is " really good for people who are leaning toward option one ( refund of 2012 entry fee )			0
" @entity45 , a copy editor for @entity56 , said thursday			0
but the other two options make for " an income maximizer for the @entity11 in terms of all those people who feel like they really have to do another race ... it 's a way of getting double payment for one actual race			0
" whichever options runners choose , a considerable total amount of money is involved			0
for the 2011 @entity8 , more than 47,000 runners paid their fees and pounded the pavements on a 26.2 - mile course that snaked through all five of the city 's boroughs			1
the 2012 marathon , scheduled for november 4,was canceled for the first time in its history so as not to draw resources and attention away from the response to @entity6 , which had blasted the @entity0 and @entity82 areas only days before			2
by the scheduled race day , many areas were still without electricity and thousands of people were in need of aid			0
just as the cancellation marked a first for the marathon in its 42 - year history , race organizers pointed out that the refund offer also was a first			1
" we started with the premise that despite ( organizers ' ) no - refund policy , we needed to be able to offer runners that choice			2
beyond that , we wanted to make sure they had as full options to run again as possible , " @entity100 , president and ceo of @entity11 told @entity1 in an e-mail			0
@entity100 said while race organizers would have liked to have offered waived entry fees for other events , " we could n't do that protect our other races and running programs			1
" runners have until january 25 to choose an option .			0

the @entity8 was canceled in the wake of @entity6
race organizers say runners can now get refund for their entry fees
or runners can opt for guaranteed entry into an *upcoming* race
