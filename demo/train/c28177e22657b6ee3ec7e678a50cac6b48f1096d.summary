-- movies are an especially fluid form of art. a person 's feelings about a particular film are based on many factors , including his or her mood when watching			1
on a more cynical day , i might not have enjoyed @entity11 's " @entity12 " as much as i did			2
letting a film sink in over time can change things , too			0
for example , in a relatively short period , " @entity19 " moved from no. 10 to no. 6 on my own personal list of the year 's best films			1
however , i 'm not going to rank this list in a strict one through 10 fashion			0
it 's not fair to the films			1
this has been a truly excellent year in the cinema			0
i could easily include 25 " top " films on my list , not to mention the films i have n't had a chance to see that are appearing on " best of " lists around the @entity32			2
still , my favorite film of the year has remained the same since the moment i saw it at the @entity36			0
i wo n't say that @entity39 's " @entity38 " is a better film than any other released this year , but i will say it 's my favorite			1
it 's as honest a film as i have seen in many years			2
and , without getting into specifics , i can relate to some of the issues and emotions that make up the core of this film			0
sometimes when a loved one is dying , you have to laugh because there 's no more crying to be done			2
sometimes you do get angry at them			0
angry for doing something foolish that made them sick in the first place ( drinking , smoking , etc. ) or even angry at them for doing something as " selfish " as leaving you			0
@entity62 's performance is also my favorite by a male actor this year			1
over the years , @entity62 has worked to overcome his heartthrob image and expand his range			1
as the cuckolded husband dealing with his dying wife , he suddenly becomes the only parent to two girls			0
he 's also dealing with a major business deal that affects the entire state of @entity73			2
@entity62 works with all these emotions and more			1
i 'm not sure he could have played this role as convincingly 10 years ago , but he has matured and grown as an actor to the point where he 's got about as much range as anyone out there			1
which brings me to my favorite supporting role of the year : @entity83 in " @entity38			1
" she plays the rebellious elder daughter forced by life to grow up exactly when she needs to			1
she 's dealing with many of the same emotions as her father , but , at 17 , has n't learned to control them as well			2
she wears them on her sleeve and has to try and put them in check while serving as a co-parent for 10 - year - old little sis @entity95 ( @entity97 )			0
it 's hard enough being a teenager , but dealing with such a dramatic upheaval at the same time is a double whammy			1
her progress from drunk , night - golfing truant to responsible older sister is not without bumps , but @entity83 is natural and a joy to watch			1
another reason i 'm touting the strength of the cinema this year is the acting , especially by women			0
@entity114 ( " @entity126 " ) , @entity115 ( " @entity116 " ) , @entity117 ( " @entity118 " ) , @entity119 ( " @entity19 " ) , @entity120 ( " @entity121 " ) , @entity122 ( " @entity127 " ) , @entity123 ( " @entity128 " ) , @entity124 ( " @entity129 " ) and @entity125 ( " @entity130 " ) are collectively an astonishingly good group of performances			0
that does n't even include @entity134 in " @entity135 " or anyone in " the help , " as i have n't seen them yet			0
@entity139 deserves special praise , however			1
she was in seven ( yes , seven ! ) films in 2011 : " @entity142 , " " @entity143 , " " @entity144 , " " the help , " " @entity146 , " " @entity147 " and " @entity148			1
" i 'm still making my way through all seven , but this gives me an opportunity to mention a film that just missed my top 10 : @entity154 ' " @entity148			0
this one pretty much blew me away and nothing would make me happier than if @entity156 and co-star @entity157 ( " @entity158 " ) were to receive @entity160 nominations			0
@entity157 gives a magnificent performance as husband and father @entity162 , who may just be going out of his mind and who is deeply aware of that possibility			0
( his mother was institutionalized for paranoid schizophrenia when he was a child )			0
we 've all seen actors portray someone going mad , but watching @entity157 walk the tightrope between having delusions and recognizing them as such -- while being powerless against believing them as the truth -- is truly harrowing			2

@entity62 has worked hard at overcoming his heartthrob image and expanding his range
@entity139 deserves special praise -- she was in seven films in 2011
@entity83 plays @entity62 's rebellious daughter in " @entity38 "
