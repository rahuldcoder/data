@entity1 , @entity0 -- the swanky and exclusive super-yacht market is bracing itself for a storm -- off the water			1
pondering his boats ? despite a softening of the super-yacht market , @entity8 will likely keep his fleet			1
the industry has bucked trends of other sectors with massive growth in recent years , but , the current international financial woes mean the uber - rich are poised to leave the plain rich behind as the market tightens			1
with estimations that hundreds of billions , or even trillions , of dollars will be wiped from the assets of the world 's wealthiest businessmen and women , the super-yacht industry is sure to be one market that suffers			1
although it is reserved mainly for the wealthy , dire predictions for the super-yacht world should be of concern to many , given that @entity29 @entity28 estimates the industry is worth more than £ 350 million and provides employment to over 3,500 people			1
so , could the credit crisis be enough to crunch the industry altogether ? @entity29 @entity28 's international development manager @entity35 told @entity2 the answer was " no " , but it could have an impact at the lower end of the market			1
chant said there were some signs that demand was " softening " for smaller super-yachts -- boats in the range of 30 to 40 meters long and usually worth anywhere between £ 1 million and £ 5 million			1
" there has been a softening of demand for smaller super-yachts			1
these people are usually immune to these sorts of things			0
but now , maybe it has finally filtered all the way to the top , " he said			0
the softening in this area of the market could also affect re-sale prices , which until now had been very stable , he said			1
the lower to middle market received a further blow recently when @entity28 super-yacht building company @entity64 , announced its closure			1
however , at the other end of the scale , things are n't looking so worrisome			0
recent figures suggest that the top end of the super-yacht market is holding firm -- at least for now			2
a @entity73 compiled by @entity74 with yacht broker and charter company @entity75 , found that new orders for yachts over 130 feet are up nearly 20 percent in 2008			2
see pictures of the world 's top super-yachts these figures continue a longer - term trend within the market			2
last year there were 254 new orders for super-yachts over 130 - feet , up from 134 orders in 2005			2
this increase is even more drastic when looking back a decade to 1997			0
then , there were just 241 yachts longer than 80 foot being built across the globe			0
by 2007 this number had soared to 916 vessels			2
@entity35 said the credit crisis was n't an issue for the attendees of the @entity98 in september			0
" at the @entity101 show we had the first news of the credit crunch really hitting then			0
people did n't really raise an eyebrow , " he said			0
and despite the weakening in the lower end of the market , @entity35 said the 60 meter - plus category was still " very strong " , with most of the build slots at major ship - builders still full			2
so , it seems likely the super wealthy owners such as @entity115 owner @entity8 , @entity117 's @entity116 , and @entity119 's @entity118 should be shielded			0
there 's no greater evidence of this than @entity8 's latest project			0
reportedly named the @entity125 , the super-yacht is expected to be about 160 meters long and become the biggest on the planet			0
although no firm details have been released about the project , rumors have included a £ 250 million price tag , and the inclusion of two helicopter pads			2
however , not all super-yacht owners possess the fortune @entity8 does , and those without such giant financial backing may be forced to leave the market			1
@entity35 said some owners of smaller vessels may look to share ownership or charter their vessel out more often in order to maintain possession			1
" chartering is the big way to make money ... it is a good way to get some money back , " he said			1
@entity150 , director and sales broker at international yacht company @entity152 , said the chartering market was expected to stay reasonably strong , although it could be affected by people wanting to spend less money on holidays			1
" we certainly have n't seen a crash			0
we are looking at people being more concerned about how they spend their money , so we may see a price realignment			0
" but the demand will be there			0
there are plenty of people on the planet that want to go boating			0
some people may not want to buy and may charter instead , " he said			0
so , if the financial crisis does n't worsen too much in the coming six months , the lower end super-yacht owners may yet be able to stay in the market .			1

the super-yacht industry is *believed* to be worth £ 350 million in the @entity28
sales of large super-yachts are steady while the smaller yacht market is softening
super-yacht owners can make money by chartering or sharing their vessels
