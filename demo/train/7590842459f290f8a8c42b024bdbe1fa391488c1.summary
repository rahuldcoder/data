former president @entity0 has a new mission : helping those with the least in @entity3			1
he has stayed largely out of the limelight since his second term as @entity7 president ended in 2008			2
but on another continent , thousands of miles from the politics and infighting of @entity11 , @entity0 is quietly burnishing a humanitarian legacy that may in some people 's eyes outweigh the controversies sparked by his time in office			1
opinion : @entity0 's legacy is on the mend he and his wife , @entity22 , are in @entity3 this week , where they helped renovate a cancer screening clinic in @entity25			1
the clinic , which is designed help women fight cervical cancer , builds on the former president 's work fighting @entity31 on the continent			1
while he was in office , @entity0 set up a plan -- the president 's @entity35 for @entity37 -- that made a massive investment in antiretroviral drugs and dramatically reduced the number of @entity31 deaths in @entity3			1
" i 'm really proud of the @entity7 people for their generosity , " he told @entity42 in an exclusive interview			0
" i wish @entity7 knew how many lives were saved			0
" @entity42 exclusive : @entity0 on @entity31 , @entity49 , @entity50 @entity0 got his own hands dirty working on the refurbishment of the clinic -- a sign , he said , of his commitment to the cause			1
" i 'm here to serve and i believe strongly that with power and wealth comes a duty to serve the least , " he said			1
" our purpose is to elevate the need for screening for cervical cancer throughout the continent of @entity3			1
" the renovated clinic opened monday as a cervical cancer screening and treatment center , and the @entity68 hope it will help save the lives of thousands of women			1
" it breaks your heart to realize that such hope was given to communities throughout the continent of @entity3 because of antiretrovirals and then women are dying of cervical cancer -- so there 's hope and then there 's despondency , " @entity0 said			1
" we wanted to help make sure that despondency did n't settle in			0
" @entity0 at his best @entity0 's harshest critics might be surprised by this side of the former president			1
his shirt splattered with paint from the project , he appeared genuinely happy about doing manual labor			0
he was joking , jovial and genuinely happy to be there			0
@entity0 was relaxed as he spoke with @entity42 , saying that after an extended period out of the limelight he feels like a tortoise sticking its head out of its shell			1
the former president is aware that his legacy will be tied to the @entity98 , but he wants people to know what he is doing in @entity3 , too			1
' history will judge ' in his comments , @entity0 also touched on the subject of @entity49 , who is on life support in a @entity106 hospital			2
" sometimes , there are leaders who come and go			0
his legacy will last for a long time , " he said of the ailing anti-apartheid icon			2
@entity49 had criticized him publicly about the war in @entity112 , @entity0 said he does n't bear a grudge			2
" he was n't the only guy , " he said			0
i made decisions that were the right decisions			0
i never held someone 's opinion against him ; i did n't look at him differently because he did n't agree with me on an issue			0
" @entity0 also initially said he was n't bothered about his ratings in opinion polls , even if some of them now put him at a similar level to @entity126			2
" the only time i really cared was on @entity128 , " he said			0
then , drawing laughter from his wife , he checked himself and said , " you know , i guess it 's nice			2
i mean , let me rephrase that : thank you for bringing it up			0
" in any case , the former president said he does n't expect a fair assessment of his legacy in his lifetime			2
" i wo n't be around , because it will take a while for the objective historians to show up , " he said			0
" so i 'm pretty comfortable with it			0
i did what i did ; i know the spirit in which i did it			0

former president @entity0 is in @entity25 with his wife , @entity22
they have helped renovate a cancer screening clinic there
@entity0 : " i believe strongly that with power and wealth comes a duty to serve the least "
" i did what i did ; i know the spirit in which i did it , " says @entity0 of his legacy
