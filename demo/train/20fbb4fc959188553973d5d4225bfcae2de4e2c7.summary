@entity0 -- most of the provisions in a landmark food safety law which passed 16 months ago still have n't gone into effect and are stuck in a rule - making process at the @entity7 , four months overdue			1
that leaves 80 % of the @entity10 food supply operating largely under safety laws dating from the @entity12 , and safety advocates and the food industry alike are puzzled			0
" it 's still unclear what 's holding them up , " said @entity15 , who directs food policy for the @entity17			1
the @entity21 was signed by president @entity22 on january 4 , 2011			1
it allows the @entity24 to take action to prevent outbreaks , increase the number of inspections and mandate recalls			1
experts : third - deadliest @entity10 food outbreak was preventable many of the provisions , however , have n't been implemented because the @entity34 has n't released the rules which the law created , which were due on january 4 , 2012			1
" we are back basically operating mostly under the law that is 70 years old because the new protections , the new safeguards in these rules have not been put in place , " said @entity37 , director of food programs for the @entity39			1
" we are very worried all the effort that was put into this by all of these @entity49 and @entity50 and independents in @entity52 by the business community and the health community will really be for naught if we do n't move forward with these protections			2
" the @entity24 defended the speed of the review			1
" these are four big rules that set a framework for a really important change for food safety , " said @entity58 , deputy commissioner for @entity59 at the @entity24			1
" each rule is complicated in its own right ; they also have many interconnections			2
" the agency also points to parts of the law that have gone into effect , like the ability to hold food that may have been adulterated or mis - branded and requiring companies importing food to let the @entity24 know whether another country refused to allow it in			1
" if you look at normal standards for how long it takes to get rules out , it has n't taken very long at all , " @entity58 said			2
" i 'm proud of this process and the pace of the work			0
" but food industry lobbyists and safety advocates contacted by @entity1 say it may have more to do with politics			0
" i think it 's an administration criticized for being involved in the nanny state			0
they 're worried about that , " said one lobbyist who has been in @entity7 meetings and spoke on the condition his name would not be used			0
" i do think there is some concern			0
will the @entity100 and others who stood with the president turn on him ? " the @entity7 says this is about making good rules , not playing politics			0
" the administration is working as expeditiously as possible to implement this legislation we fought so hard for , " said @entity106 , @entity34 spokeswoman			2
" when it comes to rules with this degree of importance and complexity , it is critical that we get it right			0
" the @entity117 and prevention estimates that one in six @entity10 gets sick from consuming contaminated foods or beverages			0
foodborne diseases cause about 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths each year , the @entity117 estimates .			0

the @entity21 became law in 2011
it was to be implemented on january 4 , but @entity34 has n't released rules
" it 's still unclear what 's holding them up , " says one consumer advocate
@entity24 and @entity34 say the pace is n't *unusual* given the complicated nature of the rules
