-- children of the ' 80s and ' 90s fondly remember a time when @entity5 actually played music videos			1
it was an era filled with art and glory and rebellion , and our parents were convinced this devil channel would surely encourage us to snort drugs and murder puppies and alter our report cards so that a d in math looked like a @entity19 truth be told , i almost got away with that last one			1
it was definitely worth a shot			2
but i hardly fault @entity24 for my dishonesty			2
of course , these days , @entity5 is known for its reality programming , and the network has basically become a giant bouncy castle for @entity30 's drunk , tanned , and pregnant			1
as a viewer , it 's kind of like virtually enrolling at @entity33			2
however , on thursday , to celebrate the @entity34 , @entity5 and @entity35 decided to go with 12 straight hours of music video programming			1
and news of this decision played out nicely all over the web as excitement built for a short taste of that bygone era			2
though , to be fair , the online anticipation rather reeked of moth balls			2
the younger generation probably did n't care			2
after reading a few of the many trending articles about the upcoming " @entity51 , " i actually spent some time wednesday afternoon nostalgically searching @entity52 for old videos from what many argue were @entity5 's glory years -- when @entity56 competed for airtime with @entity58 and @entity59 and @entity60 and @entity61 and sir @entity62			1
yes , those were the days			2
or maybe these are the days			2
the very thing i was doing -- instantly calling up videos on @entity52 -- is part of the reason why @entity5 does n't air them in the first place			1
we 've got everything we want just one mouse click and @entity76 link away			2
so , do n't hate on @entity5			1
and if there was money in music videos , that 's what they would show			1
the real money is in watching rich kids try to boink each other on @entity88			0
however , not during @entity30 's @entity34 ! thus , as a civic duty to my generation , i decided to dedicate one full hour of my afternoon to channel surfing between @entity5 and @entity35 just to see what the music video experience feels like in 2013			1
yes , it was tough investigative journalism			0
but at least it did n't require pants			0
my mission started just around 1 p.m. when , after several minutes of cable box confusion , i finally clicked over to the low - numbered @entity102 channel for @entity5			1
apparently , i do n't get it in high def. and i have to say that being out of the 800s felt dirty and weird			0
" people actually watch this crap ? " nevertheless , i bravely entered a proletariat cave of low technology , and the first video already playing was ' @entity112 's " @entity111 " from the late ' 90s			0
of course , it was that absolutely terrible boy band music , but at least it was fun to see a young @entity117 in the early stages of his world domination			1
the next video was @entity122 's " @entity121 , " at which point i promptly moved like @entity124 over to @entity35			1
mind you , the song is totally fine , but there 's just a whole lot going on in the video -- too much movement -- and i was fairly certain i was about to have a seizure			0
@entity5 's sister network , on the other hand , seemed to be dedicating the bulk of its airtime to emerging indie bands , and i was immediately introduced to a duo called @entity138 and their video for " @entity140			1
" it was decent , actually			0
thus , i was no longer foaming from the mouth			0
so , things were looking up			0
throughout the rest of the hour , i surfed back and forth , catching videos from artists i 'd never heard of like @entity147 and @entity148			1
and i also saw some hits from more mainstream talent like @entity151 , @entity152 , and @entity153			0
the highlight was actually @entity156 's " @entity155			1
" and i ca n't believe i just wrote that			0
but it 's a video that simply does n't disappoint			0
it 's colorful and happy and absurd , and somehow it just fixes any situation			0
" i 'm afraid the test results show you have syphilis			0
" " it 's all good , doc. everyday i 'm shufflin ' ! " " right			1
you 're gon na need some penicillin			1
" in the end , my hour of modern music videos definitely was n't what i remembered from my youth , but it was still interesting and fun while it lasted			1
that said , i admit i was more than happy to turn off the tv and move on to other things			0
i 'm a busy man , and it 's not like i can outsource my regularly scheduled 2 p.m. nap			0
not that it matters , what with all the noise coming from outside			0
get off my lawn .			0

for @entity34 , @entity5 and @entity35 dedicated 12 hours to music videos
@entity52 and other new media have changed the music *landscape*
" @entity155 " is as good as penicillin
