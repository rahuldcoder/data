a custody battle could be brewing over the @entity3 cat that was supposedly thought to be dead , buried and found alive several days later			1
the latest in the thickening plot line ripped from an animal version of " @entity6 " : the executive director of the @entity8 announced the group would not be returning the cat to its owner			2
@entity12 , or " @entity14 , " as he has been called on social media , was discovered " unresponsive " by his owner last week lying in a pool of blood			1
his body was cold and his face was severely disfigured , representatives from the @entity8 said			0
the cat 's owner , @entity21 , told the @entity23 that he buried his pet with the help of a neighbor			1
" if we 'd seen that cat on the road , we 'd assumed he was dead , " said @entity27 , marketing coordinator with the @entity8			2
five days later , a different neighbor said she found @entity12 walking in her yard , presumably after he clawed his way out of the grave			1
the neighbor returned the cat to @entity21 , who brought the cat , who was covered in open wounds and dehydrated , to the @entity23 for help			1
but remarkably , @entity27 said , the kitty had no internal injuries , and on wednesday , @entity12 underwent surgery to remove his left eye and have his jaw wired shut			1
he had a blood transfusion thursday , according to the @entity8 's website			1
since the attention @entity12 received after he allegedly " rose from the dead , " more information has surfaced about @entity12 's " home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial , " @entity49 , executive director of the @entity8 said in a release			2
according to @entity57 , @entity3 , court documents , @entity21 was arrested in 1998 and charged with cruelty to animals			0
the nature of the charges is unclear , and the charges were later thrown out			0
a video of a man administering first aid to the cat , along with a @entity69 page set up by the neighbor despite the @entity23 's promise to pay for the cat 's treatment , have raised doubts about whether @entity12 was injured the way his owner said			1
but @entity49 said she has no reason to believe the story she was told is n't true			0
" all of @entity12 's injuries are consistent with him being hit by a car , " @entity49 said			0
likewise , @entity23 veterinarians believe the feline was buried for a time			2
" he had dirt in every orifice of his body , and maggots covering his open wounds , " @entity49 said			0
@entity49 said she also believes that @entity12 was well taken care of before being injured , because he was a good weight and is a very friendly cat			2
" he likes human beings and is n't skittish at all , " @entity49 said			0
still , after meeting with @entity12 's owner thursday for about 40 minutes , @entity49 said she has to act in the best interest of the cat , which in her opinion means keeping the cat at the @entity23			1
@entity21 , however , has refused to sign over his rights to the cat , she said			0
" i believe [ @entity21 ] cares about the cat , " @entity49 said , but " we are prepared to fight to keep the cat			0
" calls to @entity21 were not immediately returned .			0

@entity23 says it no longer plans to return " @entity14 " to his owner
@entity12 the cat underwent jaw *reconstruction* , eye removal and a blood transfusion
cat was *nicknamed* " @entity14 " because he was found dead , was buried , then found alive
