@entity0 , @entity1 -- negotiations between @entity5 powers and @entity6 to reach a permanent agreement on the future of @entity10 's nuclear ambitions are likely to be extended beyond the july 20 deadline , a senior @entity13 official and a @entity5 diplomat told @entity2 on tuesday			1
the sources , who did not speak for full attribution , said the @entity13 and its partners in the negotiations -- @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 -- had not started talking about an extension with the @entity6			1
but there are a number of potential time frames being discussed among the @entity13 and its partners , ranging up to six months , the sources said			0
secretary of state @entity28 said on tuesday in @entity0 the negotiations have not yet bridged some " very real gaps			1
" @entity28 told reporters there had been " tangible progress on key issues , " but negotiators have yet to arrive at a " workable formula			1
" he said he would return to @entity37 to consult with the @entity38 and lawmakers on options for moving forward , including whether to extend the talks beyond the deadline			0
" our team will continue working very hard to try to reach a comprehensive agreement that resolves the international community 's concerns , " @entity28 said of the negotiators			2
despite the continued differences , @entity28 said he believed there was a way ahead			2
" but -- and this is a critical point -- while there is a path forward , @entity6 needs to choose to take it			0
and our goal now is to determine the precise contours of that path , and i believe we can , " he said			0
responding to reporters ' questions , he added that trust has to be built because of @entity6 's past track record in pursuing a secret nuclear program			2
@entity10 insists its nuclear ambitions are peaceful , but the world powers fear it plans to build nuclear weapons			1
" we do n't see any benefit in @entity6 developing a nuclear weapon , " @entity6 's foreign minister @entity66 told @entity70 's " @entity69 " on sunday			2
he said @entity6 has a number of advantages over its neighbors , including " the fact that we have better technology , " which @entity6 does n't need to augment with nuclear weapons			1
possible extension while a six - month extension would give them the maximum negotiating time , the @entity79 administration has domestic considerations to weigh , including a november deadline after which new sanctions on @entity6 would have to be imposed under @entity13 law			1
there are also opponents in @entity88 who could use the chance for an extension to try to torpedo a deal			0
when asked about prospects for an extension , @entity38 spokesman @entity92 said he was " not in a position to speculate about which path will be taken			0
" an interim deal that took effect in january required @entity6 to dismantle or freeze some of its nuclear program and open it to more international inspections in return for limited relief from crippling international sanctions			1
that set the stage for the current talks on a permanent accord			0
@entity2 's @entity109 contributed to this report			0
