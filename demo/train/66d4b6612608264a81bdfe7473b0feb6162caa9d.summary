" this is the silliest thing i 've done in my life , " @entity0 says as she emerges from her tent			2
" i should have done it when i was much younger			2
" " tomorrow you 'll think it was worth the effort , " @entity5 responds			2
it 's a bitterly cold night in january			1
i 'm at @entity11 on @entity12 in @entity13 , with @entity14 , a 69 - year - old @entity15 and @entity16 , 55 , from @entity17			1
in the midnight darkness i watch them join a line of 200 headlamps , slowly ascending the last slope to reach the highest point in @entity24 -- 5,895 meters ( 19,340 feet ) above sea level			1
( @entity12 's official elevation is the subject of dispute -- the preceding figures are the most commonly cited			1
) but i 'm waiting			2
i 'd learned from a local that while most groups trek to the summit overnight , hundreds at a time , to catch the sunrise from the top , the best time to climb is around 10 a.m. when the crowds , and the clouds , clear			1
" i know the mountain , this is my mountain , " @entity36 tells me			1
it 's a good decision			1
we 're alone on @entity12 , the highest point on @entity42 , one of the three volcanic cones that comprise the mountain			1
three champagne corks are the only sign that others had been here earlier			2
without @entity36 's local knowledge , however , it could have been different			1
tourism impact the @entity52 ( odi ) , a @entity54 think tank , estimates that every year 40,000 people attempt to climb @entity12 , bringing with them tons of waste and other environmental threats , including water contamination and soil erosion			1
the crowds threaten the beauty of the place , which cultural narratives depict as a symbol of solitude and peace			1
the glaciers are disappearing , changing the face of @entity12			1
local porters are often underpaid and climb without adequate equipment			1
hearing these stories , i 'm skeptical about the place -- other destinations are described as " purer " natural experiences			2
however , i soon discover that much has changed since the days of horrific reports of camps among open - air latrines , trash littering the landscape and congested trails			2
i find a clean mountain , with toilets at camps and along the routes			1
the environmental challenges are significant but the initiatives implemented by the @entity88 seem to be paying off			1
the odi calculated in 2009 that tourists spend just less than $ 50 million per year around the @entity12 experience			1
some 28 % , $ 13 million , is considered to directly benefit the poor			0
the odi says this is the most successful transfer of resources from international tourists to impoverished locals they 've witnessed			0
the local view take , for instance , my local guide			1
@entity36 comes from a poor farming family that lived by a road used by tourists			0
in previous years , he 'd rush toward the jeeps that drove by , hoping to receive gifts			0
" we dreamed of owning those cars , " he told me			0
" but the reality is poverty , few jobs , often unstable and underpaid			0
" the dreams get easily forgotten			0
i tried to keep mine : to live a better life , to start my own business and to be able to support others			0
" i begged guides to take me on the mountain , even for free			1
they told me i was too thin , incapable of carrying the weight			0
" they asked for my climbing equipment , and laughed as i did not have any			0
i persisted and found a guide who employed me			0
" @entity36 became a porter in 1999			0
he went back to school to study tour guiding and botany			0
in 2006 , he passed the government examination and became a licensed guide			0
" i soon thought that with my experience of the mountain i could be a better tour operator , as most of the existing ones have never been on the mountain			2
" he set up us his own company			0
" i sent hundreds of messages to people announcing my new company , and gradually people started to respond			0
@entity12 is offering entrepreneurial opportunities that were impossible a decade ago			1
conquest vs. experience the highlight of a @entity12 experience , in my view , is n't reaching the top			1
a simple , aimless wander on a mountain trail might not seem to have the drama of a summit ascent			2
but mountains are regarded as spiritual places by many cultures , not least for their natural attributes			0
this view is especially evident on @entity12 as climbers venture through five ecosystems in the space of few kilometers			1
at the base is a dense rainforest			0
it ends abruptly at 3,000 meters , giving way to alpine heathland , abundant with giant heathers			0
further up the weather changes -- low clouds envelop the slopes , which become covered with tussock grass and sporadic giant lobelias			0
here the greens are less vibrant but more varied than in the brighter forest below			0
i count 12 shades of verdant green in a three - meter radius from where i stand			0
above 4,000 meters is the highland desert : gravel , stones , rocks and cliffs			0
finally you climb into an arctic - like zone , with permanent snow and the glaciers that may soon disappear			2
clean climb does @entity12 deserve its reputation as a crowded mountain with long lines of tourists spoiling the atmosphere of solitude ? i found the opposite to be true			1
throughout my climb the trails were empty and , on the summit , i was alone			2
my secret , of course , was the local knowledge provided by @entity36 and tailor - making my own climb			1
the tourism industry sells standardized packages : everyone follows the same route , does the same thing , walks at the same time			2
i did n't -- my sense of satisfaction came from the connection with the spirit of a beautiful and legendary place			0
end of march to early june is low season around @entity12 , often marked by heavy rains			1
january , february , august and september are the busiest months .			0

@entity12 , @entity24 's highest mountain , was once *plagued* by *ecological* problems , a result of tourism
initiatives have returned the mountain close to its former *pristine* state
local knowledge , such as when to climb , can help you avoid crowds
