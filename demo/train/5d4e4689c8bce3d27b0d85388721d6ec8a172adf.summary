@entity0 , @entity1 -- many kids dream of being in the @entity4 one day			2
when @entity7 bobsledder @entity6 was a child in @entity8 , @entity9 , he had no idea the @entity4 even existed			1
all he knew was his parents were drug addicts , that his mother was a prostitute who was often beaten in front of him			1
he knew that if he was going to survive , he had to do whatever it took to make it			2
he stole from people ; he ate from garbage cans ; he got locked up in juvenile detention for breaking into a bike shop when he was trying to get something he could sell for money so he could eat			2
he had few friends , most of them acquaintances of his mother or the other street kids , many of whom were in gangs			1
his mom and stepfather were constantly getting evicted			1
when he was n't homeless and living in a park , he lived in foster homes			1
he skipped school a lot			2
he drank and got high on weed			1
life was hard and at times terrifying , and he dreamed of finding a real home			2
" i knew that there was something better , " @entity6 , 36 , said last week as he readied for his third @entity4			1
" and although there were a lot of horrible things that happened , it 's made me a stronger person			1
" just around the time he was entering junior high , @entity6 's maternal grandmother , @entity48 , took him			1
she lived in the town of @entity51 , @entity9 , about 30 minutes north of @entity8			1
as tears began to build , he talked about her steadying influence and how she was always there to pull him up or pull him back when he started messing up again			2
" she reminded me to never give up and always push on , " he said			2
inspired by her , he began to go to school regularly , even though this multi-ethnic kid stuck out because of his big afro and his shabby clothes			2
he had one thing that helped him fit in			2
something he had relied on to escape the dangers of the streets -- and the cops -- would lead him away from his terrible past			1
track and field was to be a turning point ; he had real friends now and the parents of one of his teammates eventually would adopt him			1
his coaches told him he had the talent to be an @entity75			0
fueled by that dream , he worked hard in school and in becoming a decathlete			2
he went to @entity79 and while there he won the junior nationals in 1992			1
in 2000 he was preparing for the @entity4 trials when his track career came to a painful end			1
an oft - injured ankle failed him again , and hurting so bad he could n't walk , he had to give up on his dream of going to @entity87			0
he was crushed , but as he will often remind you , his upbringing , or lack thereof , taught him to be strong			0
his conversion to bobsledder came thanks to a friend who told him there was a new track in @entity97 where the @entity7 team was training for the @entity99			1
he went down there to check it out and kept going back until the bobsledders noticed the 6 - foot , 200 - pounder and asked him if he wanted to try out as a pusher			0
he joined the team and raced periodically but was n't a regular member until fate seemingly stepped in			2
one of the @entity4 team members on the top @entity7 four - man team tested positive for steroids , so @entity6 was called into duty			1
that crew , piloted by @entity112 , won a silver medal at the @entity114			1
@entity6 retired from bobsledding after the 2006 @entity116 , where he was part of the two - man team that finished 14th			1
he had two children and a girlfriend , @entity120 , whom he met in 2004 , and he felt responsible for them			0
supporting a family on the meager money bobsledders get was impossible , and it was time to find a job and settle down in @entity9			0
that worked for two years , until the desire to compete came back when he saw the team racing at @entity97			2
he became obsessed with going to @entity0			0
he and @entity120 had to solve a dilemma : either he would give up on the idea of another @entity4 or he would go back to full - time training with the team			2
it was a risky move ; if he left he was n't guaranteed a spot on an @entity4 sled			0
now in his mid- 30s , he 'd be challenged by pushers much younger than him			0
" it 's been amazing that she 's been able to stand by me , " he said of @entity120 , now his fianc√©e			0
" she 's the financial supporter of my life			0
she 's having to sacrifice to make my dreams come true			0
" but @entity120 is a nurse , and her salary was n't enough to pay the mortgage on the home they bought shortly after they first met			0
they were n't able to pay the loan on one of their cars either			0
the bank kicked them out , and @entity120 and the kids moved into a rental while @entity6 went away for seven months at a time			1
@entity6 tried raising money from sponsors			1
the owners of the store where he was caught stealing as a youth offered him one of their bikes to raffle off			0
but with the economy in free fall , he barely sold any tickets			0
there are still tickets available on his web site , billschuffenhauer.com			0
and other companies did n't have the extra funds to give			0
at the beginning of the 2008 - 2009 season , @entity6 suffered a serious injury , two herniated disks in his neck , that made it difficult to use his arms to push the sled			1
he remained resolute that he would make the @entity4 even though he was now an alternate			0
he worked closely with a chiropractor and a team physician to get back on track			1
in january , a healthy @entity6 and his @entity185 teammates went to a race in @entity187 , @entity188 , with a very outside chance of qualifying for the @entity4			1
they finished sixth in the event , and @entity6 's dream was realized			1
" the dream is happening right now			0
that 's all i wanted , " he said			0
then he added , " it would be nice to get a medal of any color			0
" it is improbable his team will medal in the four - man competition , which begins friday			2
but @entity6 has faced improbable many times before			1
and even though many people come up to him to tell him how he is a hero , he ca n't see it that way			0
he figures himself just a regular guy who had a goal and was able to achieve it			0
heroes are teachers and doctors , he said			0
after the @entity4 , @entity6 plans to return home , find work , take online classes towards a sports science degree and move to the next chapter of his life			1
asked if those chapters will take written form one day , he said he had considered it , but right now he has a family to return to			0
and family is what matters most of all .			0

as a child , bobsledder @entity6 often lived on the streets
his mother and stepfather were addicts
he turned to athletics in junior high and became a star decathlete
after his track career ended , he tried out and made bobsled team that won silver in 2002
