-- the threat of violence against feminist and gaming critic @entity3 , which led her to cancel a speaking appearance this week at @entity7 , has refocused attention on a recent and often - misunderstood debate			1
it 's called @entity11 , with or without the hashtag , and it has triggered ongoing , online barrages between a wide variety of disgruntled people : video gamers , feminists , internet trolls , scholars , misogynists , gaming - industry journalists and almost anyone else with web access and an ax to grind			1
" it 's been the talk of video game professionals for the past two months , " gaming critic @entity26 said			1
" the culture wars that ... hit other creative media ( are ) hitting video games now			1
" even to those involved , # @entity33 is a confusing , unwieldy topic			0
so let 's try to simplify it for you			0
what is # @entity33 ? at its most basic level , it 's a heated debate over journalistic integrity , the definition of video games and the identity of those who play them			1
on one side are the so - called hardcore gamers , most of them male , who make and play adrenaline - fueled games such as the " @entity51 " and " @entity52 " shooter series			1
on another side are a new wave of gaming enthusiasts , many of them women , who are making and playing games that do n't involve a shootout , a chase or sometimes even a quest of any kind			1
then there are the others ( see above ) who smell a fight and have piled on			0
the vitriol , much of it aimed against women , has spilled from the internet into the physical world			2
in recent months several women in the gaming industry say they received rape and death threats so specific they were forced to leave their homes			1
some gamers have adopted " @entity33 " as the term for a loosely defined movement defending hardcore games against criticisms from feminists and others			1
how did it start ? the roots of the dispute go back years			0
but the current debate began in late august , when @entity87 released the latest of her videos called " @entity90 , " in which she critiques games that portray women as victims , ornamental eye candy and other archetypes			1
about the same time , game designer @entity98 was attacked online by an ex-boyfriend who alleged in lengthy blog posts that she cheated on him with a journalist from gaming - news site @entity104 to further her career			0
@entity106 denied the claim , and @entity104 's investigation found no wrongdoing			0
but furious gamers took to @entity111 , @entity112 and other places to complain about ethical lapses in gaming journalism			2
and both @entity106 and @entity3 found themselves subject to violent online threats			2
actor @entity118 , best known for roles in " @entity120 " and the " @entity122 " tv series , was credited with coining the # @entity33 hashtag later that month on @entity111			0
opponents who feel the harassment of women has gone too far have countered with # @entity127 , which was trending wednesday			2
the arguments on both sides have expanded to include such other topics as free speech and perceived media bias against core gamers			2
share your view on @entity33 why are people so angry ? the gaming universe has expanded beyond consoles in recent years to include players -- many of them women -- of casual and social games such as " @entity142 " and " @entity143			1
" according to one survey , 48 % of gamers are now female			2
more women also are entering gaming as developers or game reviewers			0
and increasingly they 're speaking out about what they perceive as sexism in the industry			0
" for 30 years now video games have really been perceived as a boys ' club			1
you 've had video games made by men , for men , " game designer @entity157 said this week			1
" and i think in 2014 , when almost half of the video game players are women ... you 're seeing some very insecure guys feeling threatened by that and lashing out			1
" of course , many male gamers are horrified by the recent harassment of women			2
others , though , say that feminist attacks on games are akin to censorship and they are tired of being lectured to by politically correct " social justice warriors			1
" " there are now two , bitterly opposed , factions in the industry			0
journalists and activists , who care more about gender politics than the video games they are supposed to be reporting on , and gamers , mocked , derided and bullied ... but unbowed , " wrote @entity178 in a september 1 @entity180 column titled " @entity181			1
" can we resolve this ? maybe , but it will take time			0
the @entity191 is an unruly place			0
just last weekend , @entity157 said she fled her @entity193 home after receiving threats on @entity111			0
as with any vast and diverse group , it will be difficult to get video gamers to agree on any strictures on their art form or community			2
but the ongoing threats against female gamers appear to be rallying support to the @entity205 side			2
on wednesday the leading trade group for the video game industry weighed in			0
" threats of violence and harassment are wrong , " said a spokesman for the @entity209 in a statement sent to the @entity211			0
" they have to stop			0
there is no place in the video game community -- or our society -- for personal attacks and threats			1
" ultimately , everyone will benefit by trying to defuse tensions between the two sides			0
and if gaming executives perceive the treatment of female gamers reflects poorly on the industry and is affecting their bottom line , they may have no choice .			0
