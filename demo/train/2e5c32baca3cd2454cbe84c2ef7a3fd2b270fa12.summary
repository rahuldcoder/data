-- when blogger @entity2 began urging readers to support his online venture , i could hear journalists everywhere slapping their foreheads and saying : hey , why do n't i try that ? lots of luck			1
but all the chatter about whether @entity2 can get his followers to part with $ 19.99 a year to read his provocative posts on politics and life misses the larger point			1
he is doing what most journalists must do to survive in this digital age , and that is building a personal brand			2
sure , few are as well known , as prolific and as possessed of sheer writing talent -- not to mention a taste for picking fights -- as @entity2			1
but in ways that are starting to look inescapable , he is determined to turn his relationship with readers into cash flow			1
watch : does @entity30 still have the cultural clout to save @entity32 ? first , the back story			0
@entity2 , a former editor of the @entity34 , was blogging 's first breakout star a dozen years ago , when the term was still associated with strange people in their pajamas			1
i followed him closely because i was , at the time , the first blogger at the @entity41			2
@entity2 has since taken his @entity43 site to @entity44 , the @entity45 and , most recently , the @entity46 , where i work			1
his decision to leave the @entity46 when his contract expired at the end of 2012 has drawn plenty of attention , especially since he says he has already raised $ 440,000 from his fans			0
watch : did @entity53 go too far in praising @entity56 quarterback 's girlfriend ? " we felt more and more that getting readers to pay a small amount for content was the only truly solid future for online journalism , " @entity2 writes			1
he plans to use the money not only for himself but also to pay his small staff			0
as a @entity67 , @entity66 , gay writer with @entity68 who has morphed from a conservative intellectual to an @entity71 - boosting intellectual , @entity2 crosses lots of lines and has an unusually passionate following			1
he is n't putting most of his content behind a pay wall , so he 's essentially asking folks to pay up out of loyalty			1
and he does n't plan to accept advertising			0
in a very real sense , though , most journalists these days are advertising themselves ( and yours truly is no exception )			2
when you see them on @entity89 , posting thoughts and witticisms and links to their work , they are doing more than representing their employers in public			1
when they pop up in cable news segments or on radio shows , sounding off about their stories , or just sounding off , they are promoting themselves			1
watch : how mainstream media fell for @entity89 hoax about @entity103 we are seeing the rise of hybrid journalists , like @entity107 , who blogs for the @entity41 , is an @entity109 contributor and writes a column for @entity111			1
or @entity112 , who writes a column for the @entity114 , runs its @entity116 blog and co-hosts @entity117 's @entity118			2
but below the level of the brightest stars , there is a survival strategy at work			0
newspapers and magazines are shrinking			0
i 've lost count of the number of reporters , columnists and critics who have been laid off or taken buyouts , only to launch blogs , join websites , churn out e-books or otherwise seek a foothold in the digital economy			0
news organizations used to frown on this sort of thing ; now they have bookers to get their folks on tv and social media editors to push their stars on @entity146 and @entity89			2
the @entity114 once discouraged its people from going on television ; now , like most newspapers , it has its own studio			0
if there was once a line that stopped journalists from engaging in blatant self - promotion , it long ago vanished			0
but here 's why that 's not a bad thing			0
most print journalists were once viewed as remote figures engaged in one - way communication			0
now they 've been forced to engage in a dialogue with their readers , responding to tweets , posting pictures , sharing more of themselves with those who consume the news			0
the walls of the fortress have been breached			0
" there 's nothing tawdry about offering your wares on the street			0
it 's how magazines and newspapers started , " @entity2 told @entity114			1
@entity2 has been a trailblazer on this front			2
and while it 's hard to imagine that many others could get people to pay for their scribblings , it was once unthinkable that millions would buy individual songs on @entity186 or pay for online access to a newspaper			1
join us on @entity146 / @entity190 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

blogger @entity2 *switched* to *independence* and charging a *fee* for content
@entity193 : it 's all about branding , turning a relationship with readers into cash
as papers fail , journalists advertise themselves on @entity89 , cable , radio , he says
@entity193 : will people buy blogs ? well , selling songs on @entity186 was *improbable* once
