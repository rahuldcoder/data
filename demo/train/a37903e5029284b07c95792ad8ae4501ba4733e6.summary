-- a @entity2 woman and the @entity4 chapter of the @entity5 sued a judge wednesday for allegedly ordering the woman to remove her hijab , or religious head covering , in court			1
@entity11 , of @entity12 , @entity4 , contends that judge @entity13 told her to remove her hijab on june 16 when she was petitioning for a name change , according to the lawsuit , which was filed wednesday in a @entity18 district court in @entity4			1
@entity12 is also listed as a defendant in the suit			0
@entity21 and the 3rd @entity22 of @entity4 said in a written statement that they had not seen the complaint and could not comment on the lawsuit			2
however , they said that @entity11 did not object to removing her head covering and that she had not informed the judge that she wore it for religious reasons			1
the lawsuit says @entity21 " insisted " that @entity11 , a naturalized citizen , remove her hijab and that she eventually complied			1
it says the judge denied @entity11 's petition for a name change , saying that she had filed her petition five days too early			0
no further details were offered			0
the lawsuit seeks an order declaring the practice of " forcing @entity2 women to remove their hijab as a precondition to appearing in court " unconstitutional and illegal			1
it asks that the judge and @entity12 not be allowed to " take similar unconstitutional actions			2
" the @entity4 @entity50 relations council released a partial video of the incident tuesday on @entity53			1
in the 30 - second video , the judge can be heard saying , " the head piece ? no hats allowed in the courtroom			1
" the statement from @entity21 and the @entity60 said that the @entity53 video was " missing some critical footage			0
" " in response to judge @entity21 's direction , ' no hats allowed in the courtroom , ' ms. @entity11 responded , " okay , it does n't matter , ' and immediately removed her head covering , without protest or explanation , " the statement said			1
" @entity21 and the court have the greatest respect for spiritual practices and all religious preferences			0
had he been informed that the head covering had some religious significance , the judge would have permitted ms. @entity11 to continue wearing it in court , " it said			1
the suit comes a day after the state 's @entity83 issued an order allowing lower state courts to " exercise reasonable control " over the appearance of witnesses and parties to lawsuits , a rule change that had been proposed after a @entity2 woman refused to remove an @entity50 garment in a small claims court			1
the order allows courts " reasonable control over the appearance of parties and witnesses " so as to " ensure that the demeanor of such persons may be observed and assessed by the fact - finder and ensure the accurate identification of such person			2
" the order , which amends a rule of the @entity107 , is effective september 1			0
the justices had voted earlier this summer to change it			0
the amendment was prompted by a 2006 small claims case in @entity4 filed by @entity112 , who wore a niqab -- a garment that covers the entire face and head , except for the eyes -- to court , the order said			1
the judge asked her to remove her niqab , saying he needed to be able to see her face to tell whether she was telling the truth , according to court documents			2
@entity112 refused , saying she was a practicing @entity2 and would take off the veil only in front of a female judge			0
the judge said a female judge was not available and told @entity112 she could remove the niqab or have her case dismissed			2
she chose the latter , according to court documents			0
she sued the judge in federal district court , which declined to exercise jurisdiction over the case			0
@entity112 has since appealed to the 6th @entity18 @entity139 , according to court documents			2
@entity4 is home to about 600,000 muslims , and close to 500,000 live in the southeastern part of the state , according to the @entity4 office of the @entity18 - @entity50 relations council			1
the @entity147 area , in @entity12 , ranks fifth nationwide for the number of @entity2 , it said			0
last month , the @entity149 of @entity150 adopted a policy allowing religious head coverings in the state 's courtrooms			1
@entity155 , the director of litigation for the @entity158 's @entity157 , said wednesday the issue has " come up in a variety of states			0
" " we are concerned about the growing number of incidents restricting religious expression in the courtroom , " he said			0
" ... this is an issue that affects a variety of religious faiths and others			0
