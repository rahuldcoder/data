@entity0 -- as with any @entity4 address , president @entity2 this year had several audiences and there were multiple aims for the @entity8 : to show that he understands the economy is still struggling and that he will do more to help the unemployed find jobs , and to portray a different side of himself than what was seen on @entity14 -- one willing to reach out to the other party			1
while the president did offer some new proposals -- including increasing the minimum wage and guaranteeing preschool -- many of the ideas he pushed were repeating what he had previously offered but went nowhere in divided @entity0			2
and we saw a president trying to expand the use of executive power to help push his agenda			2
@entity4 brings out more of the ' same old , same old ' here are five things we learned tuesday night : 1			2
it 's still the economy , stupid it very well could have been a campaign speech given last year -- the president talking about the need for a balanced approach to deficit reduction , at least four references to protecting the middle class , the need to reignite " the true engine of @entity39 's economic growth			1
" with the recovery still weak , unemployment at 7.9 % and the nation 's growth rate shrinking the last three months of 2012 , the president and his team know much of his legacy may be dependent on helping reignite the economy			2
the president pushed for 15 manufacturing hubs to help spur high tech job growth			0
with $ 85 billion in automatic across - the - board spending cuts set to take effect on march 1 , @entity2 pushed for a replacement of them because some economists warn they could lead to a recession			2
however , he did not give any ground on what he would accept as an alternative -- setting up the next major fiscal fight with @entity61			1
53 % of those watching speech give @entity2 thumbs up 2			1
mr. @entity64 ? facing hundreds of members of the opposing party , @entity2 took a decidedly different approach than he did in his aggressive inaugural address			1
" they do expect us to put the nation 's interests before party			2
they do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can			0
for they know that @entity39 moves forward only when we do so together and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all , " the president said early on in the address			2
he even praised some @entity61 -- he pointed to how sen. @entity82 , his 2008 opponent , worked with then - sen. @entity83 , a @entity84 turned @entity85 , on climate change			2
he mentioned his 2012 opponent , @entity87 , and said we should try his idea of tying the minimum wage to the cost of living			0
@entity61 's @entity91 rips @entity2 , says his plans will hurt middle class while he talked about how chances are good for bipartisan approaches on tax and immigration reform , @entity61 can be expected to say they have n't seen a different approach so far from the president on many key issues : he wants more tax revenues and more government spending on his priorities , which are non-starters among @entity61			1
fifty - three percent of those surveyed in a @entity1 / @entity106 instant poll of speech - watchers said they did not believe the address would lead to bipartisan cooperation while 39 % said they thought it would			0
@entity2 hearts @entity87 in @entity4 3			1
show me the money proposals he floated would make high - quality preschool available to every child , provide tax credits for businesses to hire and invest , promote more scientific research and development , further shift cars and trucks away from gasoline , and invest in infrastructure			0
" nothing i 'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime			0
" it 's not a bigger government we need , but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad - based growth			0
" but @entity8 officials refuse to put a price tag on the programs -- or to reveal how , in fact , they would be paid for			0
they promised more details when the @entity8 's budget proposal is released in a few weeks			0
@entity1 @entity144 : @entity2 on fuel economy -- your mileage may vary 4			0
if they wo n't , i will the president demonstrated clearly how he plans to aggressively use executive actions to push policy if @entity153 thwarts him and he announced action on climate change and cybersecurity			1
" if @entity153 wo n't act soon to protect future generations , i will , " he said			1
" i will direct my cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take , now and in the future , to reduce pollution , prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change , and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy			0
" after efforts dealing with cybersecurity failed to pass @entity153 , the president signed an executive order to increase information - sharing and to help the private sector develop standards			1
these moves came after the president last month approved 23 executive actions dealing with gun control			0
@entity2 also used the speech to make his base happy by emphasizing such liberal priorities as climate change and equal treatment and benefits for gay @entity39 as well as announcing a bipartisan commission to improve the voting system and pushing for a hike in the minimum wage			1
@entity189 : the impact of a $ 9 minimum wage 5			0
even presidents ca n't control the news while the @entity8 tried to build up suspense around what the president would say , as soon as news broke tuesday afternoon that accused cop - killer @entity198 was believed to be holed up in a cabin in the @entity201 mountains , much of the media immediately switched gears			0
what would have been hours of coverage of what was expected from the speech , what @entity2 's message might be and discussion of his agenda did not happen			1
would this be another split - screen @entity4 similar to when networks flashed news of the verdict in @entity217 's civil trial during @entity219 's 1997 address ? that did not happen this time but as soon as @entity2 wrapped up most news organizations quickly updated viewers on the @entity198 story			1
but the president might have gotten an unintended benefit from the other story of the day -- interest in @entity198 might have helped boost the audience for the address			0
opinion : @entity2 dares @entity153 to get the job done			1

@entity2 's @entity4 address could have been a campaign speech from last year
while he did give a *nod* to the opposing party , some of his proposals are non-starters with @entity61
@entity2 says proposals wo n't increase debt , but officials wo n't say how they **'ll** be paid for
president made it clear that if @entity153 wo n't deal with issues , he **'ll** do it by executive order
