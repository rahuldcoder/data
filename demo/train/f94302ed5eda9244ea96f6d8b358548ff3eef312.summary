-- there 's no question about it -- i hate to lose			0
on tuesday , @entity5 , a great @entity6 running in a special congressional election in @entity8 , lost			1
when a campaign does n't go my way , i always take a step back , look at the facts and try to figure out what we could learn from that experience			0
and we definitely learned some lessons from the @entity8 special election			1
first off , let 's put this in perspective			0
republicans held this congressional district for six decades			0
in the past decade , congressman @entity23 won his seat by anywhere from 15 % to 38 %			0
public polling in the run - up to @entity28 showed that the electorate was going to skew toward @entity21 by around 10 %			1
the actual @entity21 margin of victory ? about 2 %			1
i do n't like losing any race , but let 's not overstate what this was			0
we saw a @entity21 win in a district that is traditionally held by @entity21 -- by a significantly lower margin than in the past 60 years			1
so , what did we learn ? there 's the @entity21 dogma , bought by beltway pundits and some in the mainstream media , that it was a referendum on @entity46			1
the appeal to repeal worked , so they say			0
but , as a great @entity51 once sang , " it ai n't necessarily so			0
" according to @entity55 at @entity56 , both @entity57 , the @entity21 , and @entity5 , the @entity6 , " rejected the national ' narrative ' that the race was a clear referendum on @entity46			1
" by a strong majority , @entity58 sided with the @entity6 who was committed to fixing and improving @entity46 over the @entity21 who wants to repeal it			2
that was n't enough to change the advantage republicans held going into @entity28 , but we came really close			0
how about money ? yes , @entity21 pumped money into this race			2
@entity21 special interest groups are still committed to throwing money behind any candidate running with an " r " as a suffix			1
in this race outside @entity21 groups dumped in $ 5 million to squeak out a win in a district they carried by 15 % in 2012			1
money might have been a factor , but third party groups aligned with @entity79 also poured in money to help get out the vote			2
so @entity79 ca n't entirely say we lost because we were outspent			2
what , then , was it about ? what are the real lessons ? i think there are three : the message , boots on the ground and motivating the base			1
do n't be afraid : the @entity21 message was , as is so often , " be afraid			1
" republicans accused @entity79 of $ 716 billion in @entity94 cuts			2
this was the same theme , as progressive activist @entity97 pointed out , that shifted the 2010 election to @entity21 , and it helped again			1
it 's ironic , of course , because @entity79 want to fix healthcare , make it better and more affordable			2
it 's ironic because , by a strong majority , independents sided with the @entity6 who was committed to fixing and improving @entity46 over the @entity21 who wants to repeal it			2
it 's ironic because from the start , @entity79 introduced , pushed for , defended and protected @entity94			2
but the " be afraid " message works well for @entity21 , in part because the @entity79 do n't counter it			1
" do n't be afraid " is just not that good of a message			0
hit the ground : the second thing we learned , not surprisingly , is that @entity79 can not win without a good ground game -- and turnout still matters			1
let 's face it , more @entity21 voters filed and submitted absentee ballots than @entity79 , and more turned out on @entity28			1
as @entity97 pointed out , 58 % in precincts @entity121 won in 2012 , and 48.5 % in precincts @entity123 won			0
about 49,000 fewer people voted in this election than in the 2010 general midterm election ( down 21 % ) , and 158,500 fewer than in the 2012 presidential election ( down 46 % )			0
we saw yet again that when fewer people participate in the process , when fewer people vote , @entity21 win			1
@entity79 believe that when more people vote , it 's not just good for our party , it 's good for democracy			2
it 's all about the base : the third lesson is @entity79 must motivate the base and not rely in traditional methods to reach voters			1
in this week 's election , turnout was lower than it was in the 2010 midterm elections , and much lower than it was in the 2012 presidential race			0
low turnout in off - year races is always a challenge for @entity79			0
many of our voters require information and must be contacted way ahead of @entity28 -- and reminded of what 's at stake			0
yes , a little red meat helps because these voters tend not to be as seasoned when it comes to knowing the issues , like raising the minimum wage and creating good paying jobs			0
luckily , we 'll have another chance to win this seat back in november -- and with more people voting , we 'll have an even better shot at picking up the seat			0
while we learned important lessons that will help us win in november , we wo n't fret over this loss too much			1
after all , the @entity21 in charge of electing republicans to @entity171 said before the election , " special elections are n't too predictive for either side going forward			1
" that was true before @entity28 , and it 's true today			0
join us on @entity178 / @entity177			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			0

@entity181 says @entity79 loss in @entity8 special election was closer than expected
still , she says , there are lessons to be learned
a message of fear , activating base voters and a better ground game helped the @entity21 win
