-- this is the time of the year when @entity3 executives may get a little religious , praying that the ping pong balls in wednesday 's @entity3 draft lottery fall in their favor			1
nobody may be praying harder than @entity8 , whose @entity9 is the losingest team in @entity3 history			1
the @entity9 ended the season with a record of 7 - 59 and finished with an all - time worst .106 winning percentage			2
for the lottery , the league assigns ping pong balls to the worst performing teams			1
the poorer a team performed in the season , the more balls it gets			2
the idea is to help the team get first dibs in the draft and pick up a promising player			1
the @entity9 ' dismal distinction means it will have a 25 % chance of getting the top pick in wednesday 's draft lottery -- and the greatest chance at picking @entity32 's all - world big man @entity31			1
@entity31 , a 6 - foot - 10 power forward who led @entity32 to a @entity34 national championship this year , is believed to be the top prospect for any team who wins the first pick in the @entity3 draft			1
last year 's big winner was the @entity41 , which won the first pick despite having the second best odds of getting it			1
the draft lottery , which determines the order of the first 14 teams drafting in the june 28 draft , will be held in @entity49 wednesday night and will be televised			1
here are the odds of getting the first pick for the 14 teams in the draft lottery , according to the @entity3 : 1			1
@entity9 , 25 % 2			2
@entity54 , 19.9 % 3			2
