@entity0 , @entity1 -- at 65 , @entity3 is one of the youngest ones left			1
" can you believe it ? " he says , adjusting a borrowed yarmulke in a now - empty synagogue			2
his eyes scan the glittering stained glass , the blue - domed ceiling and the rows of dark wood and wicker benches , still arranged the way they were when , decades ago on the @entity18 , @entity17 was teeming			2
his mind races back to his childhood , when he occupied a seat in the back left - hand corner and much to his father 's chagrin , gazed upward to the second floor gallery where the girls and women sat. but a hush has fallen within @entity17 's walls			2
there have not been prayers said here in a long time , for the lack of 10 able - bodied men needed to form the minyan , the quorum required for a @entity39 service			1
@entity3 's heart feels empty like the synagogue 's pews			2
he knows the end is near for the @entity44			2
once a thriving community of 6,000 , their numbers can be counted on fingers now			1
@entity3 says fewer than 30 @entity39 are left in this bustling eastern @entity50 metropolis			1
many @entity39 began leaving @entity0 , the city formerly known as @entity0 , after @entity50 independence in 1947 ; those who remained are slowly dying off			1
@entity3 , a stalwart of the dwindling community , serves on practically every @entity39 administrative board			1
there are simply not enough people left to go around			2
" things have to be kept going , " he says of the cultural burden weighing heavy on his shoulders			2
" we 're not lying down and waiting for the sunset			2
" he runs his fingers over the cold outdoor oven at @entity17 that once turned out fresh unleavened bread			2
he peers through a window into the basement where vats of wine were stored			0
from a wooden box , he picks up a book of prayer , the pages eaten with precision by bookworms			0
" i always thought someone should take these away			0
they are all in terrible shape			0
" @entity3 's ancestors arrived in @entity1 in the 18th century from the @entity80 cities of @entity81 and @entity82			1
others came from @entity84 and @entity85			1
all of them came to be known as @entity87 in @entity1			1
they came to @entity1 to trade -- in jewels , spices , textiles , tobacco , tea			1
they made a name as exporters and real - estate dealers and bakers			0
@entity1 , said @entity100 scholar @entity99 , was one of the few places in the world that was inherently hospitable to its @entity39			1
in @entity0 , @entity39 families settled in what was known as " gray town , " the central city neighborhoods that separated the whites from the " coloreds			1
" they built graceful buildings that lined @entity112 in the heart of what is today @entity115 , @entity0 's largest wholesale market			1
jewish settlers to @entity0 eventually built five synagogues , at least two schools and a hospital			1
the schools are still operational , though not one student is @entity39			1
the @entity124 and @entity17 synagogues exist today more as memorials to a former era than as functional @entity39 temples			1
they established a landmark bakery , @entity130 and sons , in @entity132 , a favorite among @entity39 and gentiles alike who craved its fruit cake , cream rolls and lemon tarts			1
it , too , like every other @entity39 institution , faces a perilous future -- the last of the family in @entity0 , @entity130 , is 84 and frail			1
" they were so well integrated into the upper class of @entity150 culture , " said @entity99 , a professor of religious studies at @entity144 who has done extensive research on the @entity39 communities of @entity1			1
but then came @entity50 independence and the birth of @entity153 the following year			2
the @entity39 began their exodus			1
" a new social and economic order came to into being and their prospects began to dry up , " @entity99 said			2
by his estimate , the 12,000 @entity87 in all of @entity1 in 1947 have now dwindled down to less than 100			1
in a nation of 1.1 billion people , they do n't even qualify as a minority group anymore -- barely a blip			0
" it was a beautiful culture , " @entity99 said			0
" i find it terribly sad			0
" @entity99 said @entity39 communities have died violent and forced deaths in other places			1
ironically , in @entity1 , where they did not face persecution , they left of their own accord			1
that 's what makes the tale more poignant			0
it 's not that someone forced the clock on the @entity17 tower to stop -- it just did one day			0
no one knows the date , though the typewritten notices posted for a board meeting give a clue			0
the paper is yellow and frayed			0
" 21st may , 1989			0
" it was probably that way when @entity186 journeyed back to @entity0 in 1997 to cement the shadowy images of a way of life she had heard about			1
her father , @entity190 , 82 , was a rabbi at @entity17 who saw prospects for his family dry up			0
" it was very difficult to leave			0
but what can a rabbi do in a community that was dying ? " he asked			2
he began a new life in @entity198 , @entity199 , in 1964 , determined to carry on the music , the food , the spiritual norms that had taken root from a mix of @entity206 and @entity50 traditions			2
@entity186 , a 52 - year - old freelance writer who lives in @entity207 , @entity208 , recalled her parents speaking @entity210 at home and celebrating birthdays with rasagollahs , a sugary @entity150 confection			0
women in the synagogue taught her mother -- who had relied on a cook in @entity0 -- to prepare @entity220 dishes including chopped liver , brisket and matzo balls			1
she also learned to replicate the @entity225 - @entity50 specialties that her family craved			0
the stories @entity228 heard about @entity0 finally drew her back to the house at 11 @entity230 that bore her grandfather 's name : @entity228			1
her great - aunt @entity233 was the only one left in the house			2
@entity186 wandered around the dark rooms of the ancestral home , filled with heavy rosewood furniture and photographs of generations gone by			0
there , among the wedding pictures of her grandparents and aunts , she found her own			0
@entity186 sipped tea from butter - yellow cups with her aging @entity233 and feasted on deep - fried kachuris and heart - shaped " queen cakes " from @entity130 's			0
on the sabbath , she sat in dim morning light at @entity17 , closed her eyes and tried to imagine her grandparents and all the people who had come before her			0
she tried to picture what was still vivid in her father 's mind			0
" what sadness for my father to sit and walk where in his bones , in his heart and soul , he felt the closeness of everyone he loved			0
... all dead now , " she wrote in an article about her trip			0
@entity186 returned to @entity0 one other time with her sister several years ago			1
two months after that trip , her @entity233 died , severing her last link to that culture			0
she retrieved the wooden sign from the house bearing her grandfather 's name			0
it now hangs in her home , above her grandparents ' portraits			0
the @entity39 who are left in @entity0 can do little but watch a way of life disappear			1
@entity3 thinks he might devote time to establishing a museum showcasing @entity39 history ; he wants to ensure that the @entity287 preserves standing synagogues			1
" i do n't think there will be a next generation , " he says			0
@entity0 , he says , was the kind of place that absorbed everyone			1
evidence of that tolerance can be found on the same corner as @entity17 , where land is shared by a @entity299 church , a @entity301 shrine and a @entity303 mosque			0
when it was over here , they left , " @entity3 says			2
it is 1 p.m. and at that hour , @entity3 's voice gives way to the muezzin 's call to prayer .			0
