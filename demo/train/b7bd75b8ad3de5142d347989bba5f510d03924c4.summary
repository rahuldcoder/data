-- people often ask me , especially after another young celebrity takes a fall , " how did you raise two talented artists , both wonderful fathers , who both do such good work in the world ? " ( one of my sons is the actor @entity4 , the other , @entity6 , is a sculptor )			1
so many young stars seem to struggle and stumble under the pressure of their fame			0
why do some handle it well while others go off the rails ? there 's no simple answer to this question			0
a lot happens in our children 's lives that we parents ca n't control			1
from the beginning , children come to us with different personalities and temperaments ; they are born into different cultures and economic circumstances			0
but we parents are the most important influence in their early lives , and what we do affects how our kids learn to handle the stresses life brings , whatever paths their lives take			1
one dimension of healthy childhood that gives kids a solid footing in life is having lots of child - centered play throughout the early years and even into grade school			1
play is the most important vehicle children have for coping with life and making sense of it			1
@entity4 played pretend games for hours every day for many years -- making up stories , taking on roles and re-working his experiences in creative ways			1
not only did all this play help build a strong sense of inner security in @entity4 , it also built up his capacity to imagine , create and invent ideas			1
i believe these years of child - centered play helped @entity4 become the actor and grounded person he is today			1
it is of great concern to me that there is less play in children 's lives today than a generation ago			1
the hours spent in front of screens have replaced playtime outside school , and too much focus on academics and testing has eroded playtime inside schools			0
when kids are confused or scared or they do n't understand things , they work it out in their play			1
using their imagination , they rework things until they feel some sense of mastery			0
this is kids ' ongoing way of coping with life and it is crucial for building inner resilience and security			2
that inner strength and resilience begins to develop at birth			0
it is first felt as a sense of trust in others -- adults who respond to cries of hunger and who can provide a home , safety and health			0
as time goes on , kids start to carry that security with them on the inside			0
@entity116 will grow or weaken in childhood depending a lot on how we adults relate to our children in everyday interactions			0
when we are too heavy - handed with our authority , kids often feel insecure or fearful			2
when we punish them or use threats and timeouts or other coercive tactics , they might try to obey on the surface , but they are n't building the inner strength and confidence that will be their moral compass when we are not there			2
we do n't really have to over-use our adult authority with children			2
we can work out most things with them -- listening to their feelings and needs and taking these into account as much as possible			0
when we listen to kids with our full attention and try to say back to them what we heard without judging it or giving our own opinion , they feel great trust in us and in themselves			0
and this kind of listening prevents many conflicts from escalating or from happening in the first place			0
of course children need limits , but not the kind that are imposed by " do as i say			0
" recently i was walking on busy streets with my 5 - year - old grandson @entity160			0
he pulled his hand from mine			0
i asked , " you do n't want to hold my hand ? " " no , " he said , " i want to walk by myself			2
" i said , " how about this : on the sidewalk you walk alone and when we cross the street , you hold my hand , because there are so many cars zooming around			0
" @entity160 nodded yes and took my hand when we got to the street			0
this simple example shows a way of being with children , of being on the same side with them , working things out with them -- something we can do almost all the time			2
it is a way of being that helps to strengthen children 's inner security and confidence in their own ideas			2
schools are the other big influence in our children 's lives			1
children spend about half their waking hours in school and what happens there has a big part to play in the inner confidence and social responsibility they develop			2
i sent my sons @entity6 and @entity4 to a public high school where community participation , respect for differences , learning empathy and concern for others were part of daily school life			1
the school had an excellent drama program , another reason why i wanted to send @entity4 there			1
all kids who wanted to participate in the school 's stellar ensemble productions could			2
@entity4 was n't a " star			1
" he was on equal footing with all the other kids			2
stardom can be confusing for a teen -- it 's a time of figuring out who you are and how you fit into what suddenly seems like a much bigger world			0
@entity4 's high school drama experiences gave him a rock solid start in theater -- he worked hard at his craft and found delight and meaning in collaboration			1
@entity4 : together we can solve the world water crisis i believe that schools should be places not only for academic learning , but also where young people build confidence , a sense of self , and learn to become responsible citizens			1
it is one of the great tragedies of our day that our schools , excessively driven by data and standardized tests , have no time for activities that ca n't be tested			1
no time for the arts and play and the social and emotional learning that will help children handle what life has in store			1
although we parents ca n't control everything that happens in our kids ' lives , we can do a lot to help them build inner security , confidence and a strong inner moral compass that will guide them through challenges they will face when we are no longer there			1
and our schools should build on this foundation			0
we should insist that our schools address not just academics , but the whole child -- so that all our children can become healthy and strong and enter adulthood as responsible and caring citizens			1

@entity280 - @entity280 , @entity4 's mom , is often asked how she raised her children
she says kids get a a solid footing in life with lots of child - centered play in the early years
parents can give children inner strength ; she says . tough punishment *instills* fear
@entity280 - @entity280 : schools must offer children arts , drama -- activities that ca n't be tested
