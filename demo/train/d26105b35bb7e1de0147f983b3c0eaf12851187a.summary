most of boxing 's great rivalries produced three memorable fights , trilogies of spectacular action			0
they were entertaining fights that demanded sequels , then sequels that demanded sequels			0
rare is the case when it takes a fourth fight to satisfy the fighters , the fans and the press			1
boxers often have other rivals to battle , and younger fighters come along deserving their shots			2
but for @entity29 ( 54 - 4 - 2 , 38 @entity27 ) and @entity28 ( 54 - 6 - 1 , 39 @entity27 ) , their legacies require one more battle in the ring , a fourth fight that will give one a chance to finally hear his name pronounced the winner and a match that could allow the other to push aside the controversial decisions of the past			1
that comes saturday night at the @entity42 in @entity43 when the two meet in a non-title fight			1
@entity29 has , in the eyes of the judges , won two of the previous matches			2
the first was ruled a tie			0
he believes he won all three			0
@entity28 fervently believes he won all three			2
public sentiment and the opinion of sports media fall mostly in the middle			0
@entity56 : @entity57 deserves fourth @entity59 fight what everyone agrees on is that the fights have been great			1
@entity29 comes hard after @entity28 , who counterpunches superbly			1
@entity29 has knocked @entity28 down four times , three of which came in the first round of the first fight			1
had the referee stopped the fight , as they often do after a boxer falls three times , the trilogy would have been a quick one - night stand , or one - night fall , as it were			1
now the two fighters are forever linked			0
@entity28 , 39 , thinks that even though they are fierce rivals now , that might change			2
he told reporters they might even become friends			0
" because of the great rivalry we had in the ring			0
i have nothing against him except for the decisions , " @entity28 , who is @entity81 , said , according to an interpreter			2
" i do n't see why we ca n't have a personal relationship and not just a professional relationship			0
" but on @entity89 's 24/7 documentary series , he admits there is some animosity , at least on his part			0
" as professionals , we respect each other , " @entity28 said			2
" but after everything that 's happened , it 's starting to get personal			0
that 's how the fourth fight will be			1
" the soft - spoken @entity29 , a @entity102 legend , always carefully chooses his words			1
" i never hate my opponent outside of the ring , " he said			0
" it is just my job to fight , and there is nothing personal			0
i guess we are kind of friends because i look at all of my opponents as a friend			0
" @entity29 's last fight gave him a taste of what @entity28 has felt during the reading of the scorecards for their battles			1
it appeared @entity29 dominated @entity121 in a 12 - round welterweight title fight in june , but he lost the decision on two of the three judges ' scorecards			1
naturally everyone predicted a fall rematch , but it did n't materialize			0
it has a lot to do with money , as @entity28 is a better name on the marquee and saturday 's fight stands to draw more viewers to pay per view			1
according to @entity137 , @entity29 stands to make at least $ 8 million guaranteed and as much as $ 30 million if the pay - per - view sells well			1
@entity28 is guaranteed $ 3 million , @entity137 reported			2
@entity29 , 33 , is more diplomatic about why he is fighting @entity28 instead of @entity121			1
" i am giving him a chance			0
i am giving him a chance to prove he can win the fight because he thought he has won all three and he keeps talking about it , " he said			2
" so it is very important to me to win this fight , especially since @entity28 really wanted this fight			1
" ' @entity29 ' loss leaves @entity102 fans stunned some people have speculated that despite two previous wins , @entity29 might need a clear victory over @entity28 this time to avoid the judges rewarding him for past perceived injustice			1
@entity29 's long - time trainer @entity56 has even said that they ca n't win if they do n't get a knockout			1
at a press conference announcing the fight , @entity29 used his thumb to scratch into the tablecloth , " we need to win by knockout " for @entity56 to see			1
" i said , ' yes , we do , ' " @entity56 said			0
" that is the best news i 've seen yet			0
usually it 's @entity165 will decide or it 'll be a close fight or i 'm not going to predict anything			2
" and the thing is , who is going to give @entity29 the fourth fight if it 's another close call ? " @entity28 said he also feels the need to knockout his opponent to clearly win			1
he wo n't change his style , but he said he will fight " with intelligence " and more aggression , @entity28 said			2
@entity56 said his fighter will make sure the pace is more up - tempo			0
" i think it 's going to be a sensational fight			0
@entity28 is the most difficult fighter that @entity29 has ever faced , " @entity28 's trainer , @entity181 , said .			1
