@entity0 has almost everything a nature lover could desire : glorious waterfalls , spectacular meadows and valleys , groves of ancient sequoias and the wildlife that call the park home			1
of course , @entity11 looms large for visitors			1
each year , thousands of seasoned hikers make it to the summit 8,800 feet above sea level , climbing the last 400 feet on metal cables installed to allow hikers to reach the peak without rock climbing gear			1
the round trip takes most hikers 10 to 12 hours and permits are required			1
but as seasonal ranger @entity25 can attest , the park offers many stunning settings beyond this granite dome			2
@entity0 exists because president @entity28 signed a bill creating the @entity30 on june 30 , 1864			1
the legislation , which included @entity32 and the @entity33 , marks the first time the federal government had set aside a piece of land purely for preservation			2
that act is generally believed to mark the worldwide birth of the national parks idea			2
@entity0 was officially created in 1890 , although the @entity32 and @entity42 were still managed by the state of @entity44 at that time			1
these two areas were ceded to the federal government in 1906 , creating the park much as it exists today			0
summer in the park : @entity50 @entity0 stats : @entity0 is the third most visited national park in the country with 3.8 million visitors last year ( behind @entity54 and @entity56 national parks )			1
the park encompasses nearly 1,200 square miles			0
the location : the @entity60 mountain range in eastern @entity44			0
if you go : the park entrance fee is $ 20 per private car , van , pickup or @entity66			0
the fee is $ 10 a person if arriving on foot , horseback , bicycle , motorcycle or noncommercial bus			0
visitors 15 and younger can enter for free			1
campground fees vary and reservations for campgrounds that require them go fast and are strongly recommended			0
meet our ranger : @entity80 did n't grow up watching television or playing video games			0
instead , @entity83 played outside with her sister and family in @entity87 , @entity88 , visiting @entity89 and other national parks for their vacations			0
" i thought how neat it would be to live and work in a national park someday , " said @entity83 , 26			0
" the rangers at all the parks seemed to be pretty cool			0
" she started at @entity0 as an intern , working on young visitor programming			1
after interning and volunteering for a full year , she got hired as a seasonal park ranger			0
she does n't see herself leaving anytime soon			0
" @entity0 provides a unique opportunity to enjoy nature and wildlife and have interaction with visitors , " she says			1
" i love witnessing how a first - time visitor connects with this place			0
" summer in the park : @entity110 for a day trip , do n't miss : @entity112			0
you can take the one - mile @entity115 's @entity114 through the meadow			1
then make make your way to the base of @entity119 on the @entity120			0
take a drive to see the iconic view at @entity123 to see how large @entity0 is and catch an impressive view of @entity11			1
during the summer , drive along @entity125 , where the habitat is very different because you 're so high in elevation			0
@entity129 into one of the sequoia groves , such as @entity42 or the less visited @entity133 or @entity134 groves			1
favorite less - traveled spot : take the free park shuttle to stop 16 ( at @entity137 ) and walk to a marshy meadow called the @entity139			0
" there 's a little bit of a spring underneath that keeps it green all year round , " says @entity83			1
" it 's possible to see wildlife all year around this green meadow near @entity123			1
" favorite spot to view wildlife : @entity115 's @entity149 is where @entity83 saw her first bear on the job and where she spotted a rare @entity155 rail bird			1
even though it 's in the middle of everything , " animals are still drawn to it around sunset or at night , " she says			2
" our wildlife do n't like to be out in the hot sun any more than we do			2
" 7 stunning spots for @entity167 wildlife most magical moment in the park : no surprise that it 's @entity112 ( again ) for this ranger : two months ago , that 's where her fiance , a park law enforcement officer , proposed to her in the lush green grasses growing in spring			1
" @entity119 and @entity11 were in the background , " she says			1
favorite other park to visit : @entity178 ( @entity44 )			2
set aside as a national monument by @entity180 in 1908 , @entity178 was elevated to become the nation 's 59th national park ( and @entity44 's ninth national park ) on february 11 , 2013			2
if you visit , you might see endangered @entity44 condors , as @entity83 did when she and her fiance went camping there last fall			2
that 's because the 27,000 - acre park is home to 63 @entity44 condors and is one of four condor release sites in the country			2
