@entity1 , @entity0 -- as the first splinters of sunlight spread their warmth on the south bank of the @entity8 on thursday , it became clear that after more than a century , the vision of @entity11 engineer @entity9 had finally been realized			1
the @entity12 lets @entity13 and @entity14 see each other in real time			1
in all its optical brilliance and brass and wood , there stood the @entity12 : an 11.2 - meter - ( 37 feet ) long by 3.3 - meter - ( 11 feet ) tall dream of a device allowing people on one side of the @entity26 to look into its person - size lens and , in real time , see those on the other side via a recently completed tunnel running under the ocean			1
( think 19th - century @entity33			0
or maybe @entity11 - age video phone			1
) and all the credit goes to @entity37 artist @entity36			2
if he had not been rummaging through great - grandpa @entity38 's personal effects a few years ago , the @entity12 might still exist only on paper , hidden away deep inside some old box			2
but fortunately , @entity42 could not bear that thought and thus decided he should be the one to finish what his great - grandfather had started			2
it was quite simply the right thing to do			0
plus , it would make a pretty cool public art exhibit			0
send us your videos , images or stories during the twilight hours tuesday , massive dirt - covered metal drill bits miraculously emerged -- one by the @entity8 near the @entity58 and the other on @entity60 by the @entity61 in @entity14 -- completing the final sections of great - grandfather @entity38 's transatlantic tunnel			2
the drills were removed wednesday night and replaced with identical @entity65 at both ends , allowing @entity13 and @entity14 to wake up thursday , look over to the far and distant shore and stare at each other for a while ( the telescope - like contraption permits visual but not vocal communication )			1
of course , only part of this story is true			0
@entity42 is an artist in @entity37 who does have a grandfather -- minus the great prefix -- named @entity38			1
and the trans - @entity26 tunnel is really a trans - @entity26 broadband network rounded off on each end with hd cameras , according to @entity83 , an @entity85 internet provider handling the technical side of the project			2
as for the @entity12 , well , it was a fanciful idea that , according to @entity42 , came about from a typo made by a 19th - century reporter who misspelled @entity91 , a device used to measure electrostatic charges - as @entity12			1
" the journalist also misunderstood what it was about and wrote in the article that it was a device for the suppression of absence , " @entity9 said			0
" the accidental hope captured their imagination , and lots of people at the end of the 19th century thought it was a great idea			0
" the @entity12 captured @entity42 's imagination five years ago , when he began pondering how to do a project on the childhood fantasy of digging a hole to the opposite side of the @entity113			1
and because the artist also happens to have an expertise in @entity11 chronophotography -- a precursor to cinematography -- he had a slight idea of where to look for the proper equipment			1
" we all have that idea in our head if we could make a tunnel to the other side of the @entity113 , " @entity9 said			1
" but we are not all crazy enough to actually try and do it			0
" @entity42 was crazy enough to actually try and do it , but he realized he could not do the digging alone			2
so about two years ago , he pitched the idea to @entity132 , the @entity37 arts group responsible for taking the @entity134 -- a 42 - ton mechanical creature -- for a stroll through central @entity1 in 2006			0
the company was immediately taken by @entity42 's idea			2
" the whole thing is about seeing what is real and what is n't real and how the world is , " said @entity139 , a co-founder of @entity132			0
" is it nighttime when we are in daytime , and does it look familiar to us or not ? " when the sun illuminated the lens of the @entity12 next to the @entity8 , it was , of course , still nighttime in @entity14			1
so the screen inside the scope broadcast back only an empty sidewalk silently framed by the @entity61 and the @entity153			0
but then something miraculous occurred			0
a police officer and a street cleaner walked into the frame			0
the @entity12 will be on display and open to the public 24 hours a day in @entity1 and @entity14 until june 15			1
artichoke is arranging requests to synchronize special reunions between friends and family or , the company hopes , maybe even a marriage proposal .			0

@entity12 allows @entity13 , @entity14 to see each other in real time
giant scope was @entity11 age idea , came about when reporter made typo
artist @entity42 *inspired* by childhood notion of digging to other side of @entity113
