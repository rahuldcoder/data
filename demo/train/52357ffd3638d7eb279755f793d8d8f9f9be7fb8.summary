-- the holiday season is always a win for video gamers , as software makers jockey to one - up each other with slicker graphics , deeper play and more expansive @entity9 worlds			2
but the larger and more complex modern - day epics like " @entity11 " and " @entity12 : @entity15 " become , the more it often pays to keep things simple			1
classics such as " @entity17 " and " @entity18 " clearly illustrate this principle			1
as engaging today as they were when first launched decades back , it 's these titles ' sheer approachability and user - friendliness that make them timeless			2
even the most sprawling modern - day gaming experiences , such as " @entity26 " and " @entity27 : @entity31 , " still bow to the classic game design principle of keeping play easy to learn but hard to master			0
the successful games observe two vital rules : 1 ) find clever ways to spin the same basic concept ( swapping tiles , stomping enemy heads , etc. ) multiple times 2 ) tip learning curves in the players ' favor by slowly introducing added depth at a comfortable pace there 's a reason why social games , including " @entity48 " and " @entity49 , " and @entity51 apps such as " @entity52 " and " @entity53 " continue to rack up millions of plays			1
it 's not that these titles are revolutionary in design			2
it 's that although the games are easy to start playing and enjoying , they increase in depth and complexity as the player gains more skill			2
this makes it less intimidating for players of all levels to try these games , which slowly entice us into their web			1
( admittedly , the games ' low price points , on - demand access and ample personality do n't hurt either			0
) make no mistake : hardcore gaming enthusiasts do demand more value and substance from their titles than casual gamers			1
so designers are creating more robust virtual realms and expanding titles ' value and scope through downloadable updates			0
games in role - playing , simulation and strategy genres also thrive by adding greater intricacy , not less			0
in short , we 'd weep for a world without the latest " civilization " or " @entity96			0
" instead of piling on pointless game variants or needlessly complicated controls , the most popular mass - appeal games often focus on executing a few simple features well -- and presenting them in endlessly novel contexts			1
what is " torchlight " if not a smartly - placed series of mouse clicks , " @entity105 " a simple slider puzzle or " guitar hero : @entity111 " a more high - tech version of @entity110 ? no player likes to feel as if their favorite titles have been dumbed down			1
no designer appreciates admitting that behind all the fancy mission types , play modes and monsters , their basic play concept amounts to " checkers with a twist , " or simply tapping the right keys on cue			0
still , why overcomplicate matters ? freeform missions , jaw - dropping graphics and extensive online multiplayer support make excellent window dressing			0
but even in the era of sprawling odysseys like " @entity132 " and " @entity133 , " they remain secondary to a fun , engaging and approachable core game experience .			0

the most popular games often focus on executing a few simple features well
