@entity0 -- the beating by a @entity4 judge of his daughter in 2004 that has provoked a storm of outrage in the @entity10 has made me reflect on how the situation with regard to corporal punishment in schools has changed during my career as a schoolmaster and head teacher			1
let me tell you about one boy , let 's call him will			2
one day , some 30 years ago , @entity22 , a 14 - year - old boy at the school at which i was headmaster , told his home economics teacher to f * * * off			2
she marched @entity22 along to my office			2
this was the punishment which his teacher desired			1
it was the punishment which the rest of the class expected			1
it was what @entity22 expected			2
he did not swear at her again			0
i might add that every now and again my deputy and i beat boys for bullying , damage to property , insolence to staff and petty theft			0
my deputy , who hit much harder than me due to my injured wrist incurred during military service , claimed that boys never came back for more , but this did not prevent him from being widely liked and respected			0
i do not think that my action in beating @entity22 was at all similar to judge @entity49 ' action			1
whereas he had clearly lost control of himself , i am confident i was in complete control			0
whereas a male chastising a female may well be motivated by sexual desire , including a father beating his daughter , i derived no gratification whatsoever from chastising @entity22			1
i did n't lose my temper : i was merely doing my job in upholding the discipline of the school and supporting a member of my staff			0
as a consequence i feel no shame for hurting a child			0
@entity22 knew what the punishment for his insolence would be			1
in the climate of the time it would have been remiss of me not to have beaten him			0
as a boy i myself was beaten at my boarding school for idleness and disobedience , for talking after lights out for instance			0
it did not occur to me that i was treated unjustly , and indeed i continued to admire and like the teachers who punished me			1
however , all that has changed now			1
enlightened , liberal opinion is unanimous that chastising children is wicked , and consequently , since approximately the millennium , corporal punishment in all @entity89 schools has been illegal			1
most teachers would probably regard this as a good thing			1
i myself am not so sure			0
i do recognize that the onset of co-education had made corporal punishment problematical , in that male teachers can not be allowed to belabor girls			1
while alternative punishments can be devised , it is not a coherent , satisfactory situation though			0
ideally , girls and boys should be treated the same			0
what has happened is that a disciplinary option has been denied to the authorities in a school			0
yes , it is always better to reward good behavior than punish misdemeanors			2
but there was something to be said for the punishment of bad behavior with prompt , clear - cut action that was over and done with quickly			2
i suspect that discipline in schools has declined overall as a result of the abolition of corporal punishment , and that it would be improved if corporal punishment were to be restored			1
but i very much doubt if it will happen .			0
