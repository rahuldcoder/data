-- @entity1 on wednesday said it will build 4,600 electric vehicle charging stations in nine regions of the @entity4 , funded by $ 37 million in grants			1
more than half of the charging stations in the program called @entity9 will go in public locations , such as overnight parking spaces , offices , or retail locations			1
about 2,000 going into people 's homes as part of the purchase of an electric vehicle			1
the goal of the charging network and others like it is to make electric vehicles more accessible to consumers , as these cars come to market in the coming months , said @entity26 , the ceo of @entity27 , @entity29 - based @entity1 during a press conference			1
the program differs from other electric vehicle charging networks in that @entity32 is working with @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35 on the roll out , @entity26 said			1
@entity33 will release an electric @entity38 utility van and electric @entity40 sedan in 2011 , @entity34 plans to release the volt by november , and the electric @entity42 will begin pilot testing in the @entity4 by 2011			1
the stations themselves will be equipped with 220 - volt service at either 16 or 30 amps , which enables faster charging than regular home electrical service			2
@entity26 said that an electric car with a large battery could charge from empty in under four hours			2
drivers will be able to find available charging stations using either an @entity54 or @entity56 application , which can also send alerts if a car battery is running low or if a connected car is unplugged			1
the system includes software for station owners to set billing rates			0
regions are considering cheaper off - peak rates to encourage drivers to charge overnight			0
utilities can see available energy electric vehicles or run demand - response programs to slow charging rates during peak times if needed			2
" our stations are unique in that they are all networked			0
that allows them to support a bunch of software applications which are important to different constituents , " @entity73 said , adding that installation will begin immediately and continue for 18 months			0
the nine regions are : the @entity81 and @entity82 , @entity83 area ; @entity84 , @entity29 ; the @entity85 and @entity86 , @entity29			0
region ; @entity88 ; @entity89 , @entity90 ; @entity83 ; @entity91 ; @entity92 , @entity93 ; and @entity94 , @entity95			0
of the total in grants , $ 15 million will come from the @entity98 as part of the stimulus act and another $ 22 million will come from other sources , @entity26 said			1
as part of project , @entity32 will gather data on driver usage patterns and report it to the @entity98 until october 2013			2
