editor 's note : @entity2 is the author of a new book , " @entity4 : getting down to the business of @entity6			1
" he provides commentary on @entity10 's " @entity9 " daily from 4 to 7 p.m. et. you can also visit @entity2 's @entity13 blog			1
@entity10 's @entity2 says " the pain wo n't go away " until @entity17 administration 's misdeeds are addressed			1
( @entity10 ) -- it does n't go away by itself			0
@entity18 " went away " when @entity19 resigned the presidency in disgrace and left town never to be heard from in an official capacity again			2
the @entity17 presidency is thankfully over ... but the damage he and @entity26 did continues to press on the nerve of the @entity29 people like an impacted wisdom tooth			1
and until the questions surrounding arguably the most arrogant and perhaps most corrupt administration in our history are addressed , the pain wo n't go away			1
from @entity38 ( " impeachment is off the table " ) @entity39 to president @entity40 ( " i want to look forward , not backward " ) @entity40 , the country is being poorly served by their @entity43 government			1
and on this subject president @entity40 is dead wrong			1
@entity17 and his accomplices damaged this country like it 's never been damaged before			1
and it 's not just the phony war in @entity48 or the torture memos that justified waterboarding			0
it 's millions of missing emails and the constant use of executive privilege and signing statements			0
it 's the secretive meetings with @entity58 and other energy executives and the wholesale firing of federal prosecutors			0
it 's trying to get the president 's personal attorney seated on the @entity65 and that despicable @entity67 sitting in front of congressional investigators whining , " i do n't remember , i do n't know , i.			0
. etc. " it 's the domestic eavesdropping in violation of the @entity72 , the rendition prisons , and the lying			0
it 's looking the other way while the @entity77 drowned and its people were left to fend for themselves			2
it 's the violations of the @entity81 , the soiling of our international reputation and the shredding of the @entity29 @entity86			0
it 's the handing over of $ 700 billion to the @entity90 fat cats last fall , no questions asked			0
where is that money ? what was it used for ? it 's the no - bid contracts to firms like @entity99 and @entity100 and the shoddy construction and lack of oversight of reconstruction in @entity48 that cost @entity29 taxpayers untold billions			0
if the @entity107 were serious about restoring their reputation , they would join the call for a special prosecutor to be appointed so that at long last justice can be done			1
it 's too late for @entity17 to resign the presidency			2
but it 's not too late to put the people responsible for this national disgrace in prison			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity17 administration left behind a trail of misdeeds
@entity2 : @entity40 is wrong to say he only wants to look forward , not back
@entity2 : damage will last until @entity26 deeds are addressed
@entity2 : a special prosecutor should be named to investigate
