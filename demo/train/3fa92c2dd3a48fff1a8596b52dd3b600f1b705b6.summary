-- just as the sun peeked over the horizon , @entity1 arrived at work			1
eight floors up , he opened a @entity6 , looked out his office window at the frozen @entity9 plains and smiled			1
maybe the rest of @entity11 is tired of this winter 's punishing snows , but @entity1 and his colleagues are thrilled			1
" yeah , realistically we do like seeing that snow accumulation , " he says , " because that water will go into the water cycle			2
there is a lot of moisture going into lakes and reservoirs and that is a good thing			2
" @entity1 is with the @entity26 based in @entity27			2
for the past decade , the center staff has watched dry conditions hurt farming , tourism and even city water supplies , so they can see good in this winter 's storms , and even in the catastrophic floods that ravaged @entity36 in september			1
last year at this time , well over half the country was in drought			1
" now , it 's 37.6 % , " @entity1 says , " so we 've had some improvement over that time			2
" whether a big snowfall is seen as lovely , treacherous or both depends , like beauty , on the beholder			2
certainly , millions of @entity11 who have been pounded by storms are not pleased			2
schools have lost days of education , airlines have lost millions of dollars , cars have been wrecked , houses plunged into darkness , and the entire industry of @entity55 has been thrown into a heart stopping tailspin			2
i ca n't even guess how many young lovers in the @entity60 were scrambling to find flowers and chocolates after being snowed in for the critical days before the holiday			2
it could be worse , of course			2
modern meteorology gives us better warning about bad weather than mankind has ever known			0
sure , the @entity72 - @entity71 dustup suggests there is still room for disagreement about forecasts			1
but back in 1888 , when the @entity78 was in its infancy , an unexpected blizzard on the @entity81 left more than 200 people dead , many of them children who were trying to get home from rural schools			0
it was a national tragedy , unimaginable today			0
yet greatness grows beneath the drifts , too			0
at the same time as that disaster in the @entity93 , some of @entity91 's greatest impressionist painters were enthralled with winter scenes			1
@entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and many others stood in the freezing cold to capture landscapes of snow and ice			1
although the whites , blues and grays of the winter scenes are often overlooked even by art enthusiasts , who tend to favor the bold colors of spring and summer , the artists themselves were fascinated by the delicate interplay of light on the luminous , frozen surfaces			1
well before the impressionists took off , acclaimed painter @entity116 , from @entity117 , unveiled a winter masterpiece			1
" the @entity121 " is huge , powerful and cools the @entity120 even on the steamiest days			0
the @entity123 , of course , would love to have more snow at @entity125 , where soaring temperatures have threatened to turn ski slopes into mudslides			0
but in @entity133 , at the famed @entity132 , one of the world 's most treasured paintings is a winter scene			1
no one knows the identity of the beautiful young woman riding in a sleigh in @entity140 's " @entity139 , " but it captures something of the rare spirit of people around the world who find beauty and contentedness living in cold climes			0
brutal snow and cold have informed many of the arts , and sometimes in ways that produce visceral reactions			0
read @entity155 's short story , " to build a fire , " about a man freezing to death in the @entity160 , and chances are you 'll start to shiver			0
recall the frosted face of @entity163 at the end of " @entity165 , " and the cold fairly seeps into your bones			0
@entity168 also enjoys the cold			0
core samples of ice from the poles tell us volumes about climate change , natural history and perhaps even the origins of the @entity178 itself			1
tiny bubbles , sealed in the ice , allow us to sample the air of the ancients			1
mammoths and men alike , frozen in time , have been preserved in remarkable ways , giving us glimpses of life on @entity178 long , long ago			0
in the early 1990s , a @entity189 couple hiking around the @entity190 found the head and shoulders of a frozen man poking up from the ice			1
turns out he was something of a time traveler			0
researchers concluded he died during the @entity197 , some 3,000 years before @entity198			0
yet the perpetual winter of the mountains preserved him so well , scientists knew he ate venison not long before dying , and they could even tell the color of his eyes			1
greatness has come in from the cold			0
polar explorer sir @entity210 's ship , @entity212 , was crushed by @entity214 ice in the early 1900s			1
his expedition was a failure			0
but the daring journey he and his men made in an open boat to escape the savage cold made him into a hero			0
like i said , as hard as this winter has been , it 's all in how you see it			1
so , with much of the @entity93 still hurting for water , maybe it 's not surprising that back in @entity27 , @entity1 and his pals look at reports of blizzards blanketing much of the nation and say , " from our perspective here , we wish we 'd seen a little bit more			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			1

@entity238 : @entity240 has many *benefits* , especially for the drought - *stricken* @entity242
winter has been the subject for many artists , from @entity95 to @entity96
@entity240 and ice serve as *important* indicators for scientists
