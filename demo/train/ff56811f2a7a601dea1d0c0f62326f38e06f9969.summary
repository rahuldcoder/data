-- the failed - startup story is familiar by now			2
a pair of @entity4 grads come up with a million - dollar idea , let 's say @entity7 for cats			0
" @entity18 " joins a startup accelerator , builds an @entity11 app , gets a few million dollars from a venture capital firm , moves into a hip office in @entity15 and hires a handful of bright 20 - something employees			2
then they discover that cats hate cars , rarely have important appointments they need to keep and are all mysteriously using @entity26 devices			0
the product fails , and @entity18 shuts down			0
@entity28 is a @entity29 - based startup studio that does things differently			1
instead of going all - in on one product , @entity28 gives multiple ideas room to grow , and even die , in order to single out the most promising sites , apps and tools			1
" we try to fail fast and small , " explained founder and ceo @entity41			0
@entity41 describes @entity28 as a creative company of builders			1
its employees work together in a studio atmosphere to conceive , build and grow multiple products at a time			1
if one idea is n't working , they can refocus their energies on something new			1
" every place i 've worked before has always been trying to make a specific product or company work , so you had no alternatives , " said @entity53 , @entity28 ' senior vice president of product , who formerly worked at @entity54 and @entity55			1
" we do n't have that constraint here			2
" many of @entity28 ' more popular offerings help people discover or organize news and other content , like @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and most recently @entity72			2
and the 6 - year - old company recently branched out into games with the release of " dots , " a deceptively simple game that requires players to connect colored dots with swipes of a finger			1
the abstract and addictive @entity11 game shot up @entity84 's charts , attracting a million users in its first four days and 3 million users in the month since it launched			2
@entity28 says 250 million games of " dots " have been played			1
the company is moving fast to capitalize on the buzz and on thursday released an @entity93 version of the game			1
like most of @entity28 ' offerings , " dots " was created quickly ( the team started in january ) , and its design was kept minimal			1
to come up with a product , the team starts with a running list of about 80 things they feel should just be better , from weather apps to business cards			0
every four to six months , they 'll go through the list and pick up to a dozen things that they want to prototype			0
after one month , they 'll look at the first version of the app or site and , if it addresses a need , get it into the hands of 100 beta testers			0
in the past four months the company has been focused on launching five small companies , part of its " @entity123 " program			0
in addition to " dots , " there is @entity127 , a search engine for @entity129 ; @entity130 , a personalized weather app ; @entity131 , which allows musicians to collaborate on music online ; and @entity134 , which lumps @entity136 videos together based on the viewer 's specific interests			0
even once they 're launched , these products can be shut down by @entity28 at any time			1
killing off an app is n't a big deal for @entity28 , unlike a startup that 's pouring all its energy into a single idea			1
and instead of losing their jobs , the developers and designers just move on to the next @entity28 idea			2
" what makes it easier for us is , we sort of celebrate the ones we kill off as much as the one we spin off , " @entity53 said			0
the company also buys and rebuilds established tech properties such as @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity72			2
when it bought the once - mighty @entity69 , that site cost $ 230,000 a month to run			0
@entity28 stripped @entity69 down and rebuilt it completely in just six weeks , creating a far simpler version of the curated - news site that costs only $ 19,000 a month to operate			1
" if you think about the dynamic of what @entity69 was , a crowd - sourced news site , i think @entity162 figured out a more scalable mechanism , " @entity41 said			0
" what @entity69 was needed to be rethought from the ground up			0
" some products are spun off into standalone companies , like traffic - analytics tool @entity168 and url shortener @entity171			0
others have been sold off to large tech companies such as @entity174 , @entity162 , @entity54 and @entity175 for a tidy sum			0
@entity28 also invests seed money in young startups , many of which , like @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 , have gone on to be hugely successful			1
the business model and minimalist approach to apps is working out swimmingly for @entity28			1
according to @entity41 , the company is " wildly " profitable .			0

@entity29 startup studio behind the hit game " dots " has a unique business model
@entity28 develops its own ideas and buys interesting startups to grow them
because the company is working on multiple products , it can kill the ones that do n't work
on thursday , @entity28 released an @entity93 version of its " dots " game
