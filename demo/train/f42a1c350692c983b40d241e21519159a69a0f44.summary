@entity0 -- president @entity2 on wednesday proposed a package of measures intended to reduce gun violence in the wake of the @entity8 school massacre last month			0
some of the steps have been tried before and others are expansions of laws and policies already in place			0
some face high hurdles in @entity17			2
will they work ? here 's a look at some of the key measures : @entity21 on assault weapons the @entity23 , a provision of anti-crime legislation president @entity25 signed into law in 1994 , outlawed military style semiautomatic weapons that fire one round per trigger pull and automatically eject the shell casing and reload the chamber			1
in addition to these weapons , the ban also limited semiautomatic rifles , semiautomatic pistols and semiautomatic shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine and have at least two military style features			1
@entity17 allowed the prohibition to expire in 2004			2
sen. @entity42 said in december that she would introduce a bill to ban assault weapons			1
did it work ? : two studies point to too little evidence or too little time having passed to calculate the impact of the ban			1
a provision in the 1994 law required the attorney general to deliver a report to @entity17 within 30 months of the ban evaluating its effects			2
the summary of that report , conducted by the @entity58 , said that " the public safety benefits of the 1994 ban have not been demonstrated			2
" the authors of the study suggested further tests of enforcement techniques , including " strategic crackdowns on ' hotspots ' for gun crime and strategic crackdowns on perpetrators of gun violence			0
the authors suggested these techniques might be " more immediately effective , and certainly less controversial , than regulatory approaches alone			0
" a june 2004 @entity75 study found that the ban succeeded in reducing crimes involving assault weapons			1
but the benefits at the time were outweighed by increased use of non-semiautomatic weapons , which the study said were used more frequently in crime			2
the researchers could not credit the ban with a drop in overall gun violence over the same period			2
the study did point out that since assault weapons were used no more than " 8 % of gun crimes , even before the ban , " its impact was likely too small to reliably measure			1
@entity2 - backed gun bills considered a long shot in @entity17 high - capacity magazines the same 1994 anti-crime bill also banned magazines that held more than 10 rounds of ammunition			1
but it , too , expired after 10 years			2
following a 2011 attack in @entity104 that killed six people and seriously wounded former rep. @entity106 , congressional leaders called for a ban on high - capacity magazines			1
the shooter in that attack used a semi-automatic pistol with a 33 - round magazine			0
sen. @entity113 , @entity114 , announced a proposal to limit high - capacity magazines			1
after the @entity8 shooting in @entity8 , @entity113 announced plans to re-introduce legislation to ban high - capacity magazines			1
other legislators are pursuing requirements for background checks on the purchase of ammunition as well as seeking to ban the online sale of ammunition			1
@entity129 rep. @entity128 told @entity1 on tuesday that a ban on high - capacity magazines could garner @entity133 support , but a full - scale prohibition on assault weapons would be difficult to get through the @entity133 - controlled @entity136			1
did it work ? : the 2004 @entity75 study noted that guns with high - capacity magazines were used in up to 25 % of gun crimes , but it was not clear how often the outcome of the attack depended on the capacity of the magazine			1
the study did note that since the rate of a shooter hitting intended victims is low in gun crimes , the ability to fire more shots more quickly increases the likelihood of a target being hit			0
a @entity157 analysis also found that during the10 - year ban on high - capacity magazines , those seized by police in @entity160 dropped during that span			1
when the ban was lifted in 2004 , the seizures rose " sharply			2
" researchers interviewed by the @entity157 note that the ban could have helped limit the availability of the magazines			2
but the @entity157 analysis also notes that the impact of the ban is " hard to measure			2
" a look at @entity175 gun laws @entity177 background checks sen. @entity178 , the chief supporter of legislation to impose universal background checks , calls them the " sweet spot " for curbing gun violence and the likelihood of getting legislation passed			1
@entity175 law requires that any time someone buys a gun from a federally licensed gun dealer , the dealer is required to run a check on the potential buyer for possible criminal and mental issues			0
records are kept by state and federal agencies			0
convicted felons , people convicted of violent domestic crimes and those determined by courts to be dangerously mentally ill are prohibited by federal law from buying firearms			1
however , federal law does not require background checks for what are considered private transactions			1
and there are gaps in the existing system -- many states do n't report the names of people who have been labeled dangerously mentally ill. and there are huge gaps in the database			0
for instance , the @entity218 shooter who killed 33 people in 2007 passed two background checks when buying guns because @entity160 did n't submit his mentally ill status to the database			1
would they work : achieving this goal will take a combination of the executive action the president took on wednesday and legislation to change existing laws on the requirement of background checks			1
@entity2 said wednesday that he has taken action to address legal barriers to states sharing relevant information to the database and other measures like ensuring that physicians can ask patients about guns in their homes			0
the legislation @entity178 is considering would encourage states to comply with sharing relevant information to the database by withholding federal funds for their law enforcement initiatives -- the federal government ca n't require the states to comply , but it can make it worth their while			2
it would also make it a crime for someone to sell a firearm without taking the buyer to a place where a background check can be performed			0
enforcement would be an issue though -- it could be difficult to prove whether a firearm already on the market was sold before or after the requirement was implemented			0
across the country , more than a million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records , drug use or mental health issues , according to @entity268 figures			1
that figure , however , is a small fraction of overall gun sales			0
mental illness measures four of the 23 executive actions that @entity2 announced on wednesday address access to mental health care through @entity283 and @entity284			0
@entity283 is the largest provider of mental health care in the country and the @entity284 opens access to millions of other @entity175 covered by the federal government			0
another executive action was to open a national dialogue on mental health led by health secretary @entity292 and education secretary @entity293			0
@entity2 also clarified that a provision in @entity284 does not prohibit doctors from asking their patients about guns in their homes			0
a number of mass shootings have been committed by people known to have struggled with mental illness which has renewed calls to address mental illness in a more comprehensive manner			0
federal legislation restricting access to guns for the mentally ill was firs enacted in 1968			1
would it help ? : a number of mental health advocacy groups came out in support of the president 's announcement			0
the @entity316 released a statement applauding the initiatives put forth from vice president @entity320 's task force , calling it the chance to fix the broken health care system , " an opportunity that comes only once in a generation			0
" the group also supported that the president " correctly noted " that many of the mentally ill were not violent			1
@entity316 expressed its hope that the attention could help fill gaps in the mental health system			0
@entity268 statistics showed about 1 percent of applicants who failed a background check were turned down for reasons related to mental health			0

a federal assault weapons ban and ban on high - capacity magazines expired in 2004
research looking at the impact of the assault weapons ban is *inconclusive*
a 2007 law *strengthened* background checks for the mentally ill
@entity177 background checks would close *loopholes* but could be difficult to enforce
