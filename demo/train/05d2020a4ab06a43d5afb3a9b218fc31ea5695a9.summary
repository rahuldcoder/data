-- @entity2 coach @entity1 signed off in style on friday , securing yet another slice of silverware for the @entity7 club before embarking on his self - enforced sabbatical			1
a 3 - 0 victory over @entity10 in the @entity12 final saw the all - conquering @entity14 coach take his haul of trophies to 14 during his four - year tenure , and even if he decides never to return he will have left an indelible print on the sport			1
his final match underlined his approach to the game ; the manner of the triumph important as the result			1
@entity2 were 3 - 0 up inside 25 minutes as @entity10 were forced to chase shadows , like so many teams that have gone before them			1
@entity1 has built on @entity2 's pure football principles with a totalitarian approach to " tiki taka , " a style reliant on short passing and dynamic movement , and the results have helped an already successful unit transcend a higher plane			1
@entity1 signs off in style as @entity2 win @entity12 @entity1 's vision has been enshrined by fellow disciples of @entity2 's famed @entity46 youth academy , players like influential @entity7 pair @entity40 and @entity41 , as well as prolific striker @entity42			1
they have helped him deliver three successive @entity49 titles , two @entity50 crowns , two @entity7 cups , two @entity53 titles and five further trophies with a soulful swagger that has had many a pundit purring that this is one of the greatest club sides of all time			0
@entity1 's masterstroke has been to morph the basics of @entity2 's philosophy into a new style of soccer that has confronted convention , according to @entity7 football expert @entity66			1
" what @entity1 has done to some extent is challenge some of the truisms and @entity70 © s of football , such as defending is about sitting deep and denying space for teams , " @entity66 told @entity0			2
" @entity2 have done the opposite , they 've gone and looked for teams , defended with possession which teams perhaps have n't done before			2
guardiola -- the greatest soccer artist ever ? " the challenge , for example , on the use of the word practical or pragmatic , to talk about what is essentially a long ball game , but what could be more pragmatic than winning what @entity2 have won in the last four years ? " @entity88 played with @entity1 during a golden era for @entity2 , when legendary @entity91 coach @entity90 led the club to three consecutive league titles and their first @entity50 triumph in the early 1990s			1
@entity88 believes @entity1 's innovative , progressive approach to the game was born during that period under @entity90 , himself a staunch defender of @entity2 's cherished attacking philosophy			1
" @entity1 tried to play simple football , " said @entity88 of his friend , also @entity14 born and bred			1
" he created the philosophy where if you can play an easy pass why would you play a difficult one ? " @entity2 are one of the few teams who always had 70 - 75 % possession in games because of the players they had and the philosophy of keeping the ball			1
he was very demanding of that -- not giving the ball away			0
" all the teams now defend against @entity2 and he had to adapt to those solutions			2
he did n't always play the same system -- with three defenders or four , playing with a ' 9 ' ( a traditional striker ) or without a ' 9 ' -- always making things difficult for the opposition			0
" all the movements he created , with the two full backs pushed forward and the center backs very wide , all started with him			0
" @entity127 , from the @entity129 website , attributes the development of @entity1 's coaching philosophy to how the former @entity2 captain 's own playing career panned out -- where there was a general loss of faith in the deep - lying midfield position @entity1 used to occupy in favor of more aggressive midfielders " he had to leave @entity2 as a player and take quite a big drop down to @entity143 ( in @entity144 ) because , frankly , no good club wanted a player in that mold			1
everyone wanted big battlers deep in midfield , like @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154			0
" now , he 's managed to construct a team featuring four players who looked up to him when they were in the @entity2 youth team : @entity158 , @entity41 , @entity40 , @entity159			2
" i think almost every big club in @entity161 has copied @entity2 's way of playing , to a certain extent , in recent years			1
it 's remarkable that that is now the way to play football , considering his struggles towards the end of his playing career as a deep - lying passer			2
" as ever in the often fickle world of football , @entity1 has his detractors , who attribute his success as a masterstroke of timing , claiming his tenure conveniently began just as a clutch of great players rolled off the famed @entity2 production line			1
and while there may be truth in that argument , @entity66 believes it was the way @entity1 allied the likes of @entity41 , @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity158 and @entity159 to his own football philosophy that was more pertinent			2
" @entity1 has been the most zealous defender of a certain type of identity -- he has n't been the creator of that identity , " said @entity66			2
" there 's an almost puritanical conviction about how you 've got to do things			0
that mindset has its flaws but @entity2 stick to it			0
" he was absolutely the right man at the right time with the right squad , the right players around him			0
it has been a culmination of circumstance but without that identity it would n't have been as clear or as unshakable			0
" this unflinching devotion to @entity2 's cause and the all - consuming nature of the job has taken its toll on @entity1			1
as well as his own meticulous nature combined with the weight of responsibility that comes with being @entity2 manager , another explosive element -- @entity216 manager @entity215 -- only added to the pressures on the 41 - year - old			2
" people close to him have said they 've been worried about him for a long time , " said @entity66			0
" that he does n't eat as well , he looks skinnier , he 's lost his hair			0
" @entity1 has struggled to understand the depth of tension that has been created by this rivalry with @entity215 over the last year			0
i think he has found that genuinely unpleasant at times and has n't known how to deal with it			0
" i think those things have all come together to put us in a position where @entity1 thinks , ' i 've had too much , it just is n't enjoyable any more			0
' " in typical @entity2 style , at the press conference to confirm @entity1 's departure , the club announced his erstwhile assistant @entity237 , another pupil of the club 's famous school , would replace him			1
@entity88 , who describes his former teammate as a relaxed individual , thinks @entity1 is calling time on his @entity2 tenure at just the right moment			1
" he is the manager who has changed everything , " he said			0
" he 's been clever in choosing the moment to leave because in @entity2 he will always be welcome and he can have whatever position in the club he wants			2
" @entity1 's self - enforced break may only be in its embryonic stages but for those fearful he will be lost to football forever , his comments prior to his final match should provide reassurance that he will be back to reinvent the wheel again before too long			1
" for the next months i have to charge my batteries and charge my mind , " he said			0
" i am going to rest and i will wait			0
i will be ready once a club wants me , if they seduce me i will train again			0

@entity1 has enjoyed a trophy - laden spell as @entity2 coach
the former @entity2 player has led the @entity14 *giants* to 14 major *honors*
@entity1 has won *plaudits* for @entity2 's *devastating* passing style
his final match was friday 's 3 - 0 @entity12 final win over @entity10
