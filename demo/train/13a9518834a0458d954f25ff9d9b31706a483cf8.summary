-- when @entity2 sits across from the @entity3 to seek their presidential endorsement , i ca n't wait to hear his reaction to these men and women carrying guns and tasers when they ask him to explain why he does n't think the nation needs more of them on the streets			1
mr. @entity13 sounded like a completely out - of - touch guy when , in an effort to slam president @entity17 's news conference on the economy , said : " he wants another stimulus , he wants to hire more government workers			1
he says we need more firemen , more policemen , and more teachers			0
did he not get the message of @entity26 ? the @entity28 people did			2
it 's time for us to cut back on government and help the @entity28 people			1
" last i checked , teachers , firefighters and police officers are @entity28			1
in fact , if you have ever had your home broken into , i 'm sure the last thing you want the 911 operator to tell you is they will have to schedule a cop to drop by as if he 's an air conditioner repairman			0
when your house is going up in flames , i doubt there would be many chuckles if the 911 operator says , " @entity2 says you should be happy to have a smaller government , so we wo n't be able to send someone to put out the fire until monday morning			1
" this is the kind of ignorance that gets passed off to us as smart political thinking			0
trust me , i get the whole argument of downsizing government			0
but people like @entity2 act as if the essential services that makes our neighborhoods , towns , cities and states run is n't done by government employees			1
need that trash picked up ? yeah , it smells a bit funky , but suck it up , @entity2 says we can get by with fewer garbage collectors			2
tired of that pothole ? do n't complain			0
just drive around it since we do n't have the manpower to get them fixed in a timely manner			0
it 's real easy to take shots at government , but when it comes to determining what is essential to our daily lives , we must have a different conversation			1
when you 're a rich guy like @entity2 , public school teachers mean nothing to you since you can afford to send your kids to private schools , hire tutors and enjoy those small classrooms			1
but if you 're like most of " the @entity28 people " you ca n't stand overcrowded classrooms and few resources			2
but @entity2 does n't care			2
instead of separating the battle between union contracts and cities from actual people , he chose to make a ridiculous comment and dismiss the millions of hardworking @entity28 out there			2
that 's even more laughable considering republicans call themselves the law - and - order party , and are quick to tout their police endorsements			0
how many times have we seen @entity2 's party pals call @entity109 firefighters heroes after 9/11			1
so , @entity2 , should we not bother to expand the ranks of the men and women who keep us safe ? @entity2 does n't have to worry about the @entity17 campaign or the @entity114 running ads showing him to be an out - of - touch rich guy who does n't care about blue - collar workers			1
we just have to wait for him to open his mouth			0
and we wo n't have to wait long			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity120 .			0

@entity2 's slam on @entity17 's remarks was out of touch , says @entity120
teachers , firefighters and cops are @entity28 too , @entity120 says
@entity120 : we need a serious conversation about what we need in our daily lives
@entity2 does n't need the @entity17 camp to make him look out of touch , @entity120 says
