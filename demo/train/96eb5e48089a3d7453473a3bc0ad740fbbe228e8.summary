-- in a season of lows , golf 's @entity1 hit a new low as he simply walked off the course following a disastrous start to the second round of his defense of the @entity11 title in @entity12			1
@entity1 was seven over par for eight holes and about to drop more shots after hitting his approach to the 18th -- his ninth -- into the water at @entity20			1
the @entity21 shook hands with his playing partners @entity23 and @entity26 's @entity25 and beat a hasty retreat with his coach and his caddie			0
golf journalist @entity30 , tweeted that @entity1 " was near tears as his caddie placed his clubs into the trunk of his blue @entity35			2
" @entity1 later issued a statement apologizing for his " sudden withdrawal			1
" he added : " i have been suffering with a sore wisdom tooth , which is due to come out in the near future			1
it began bothering me again last night " it was very painful again this morning , and i was simply unable to concentrate			0
it was really bothering me and had begun to affect my playing partners			0
" i came here with every intention of defending my @entity11 title			1
even though my results have n't revealed it , i really felt like i was rounding a corner			0
" i regret having to make the decision to withdraw , but it was one i had to make			0
" @entity1 had battled to a level par first round at @entity54 -- six shots behind first round leader @entity56 of @entity57 -- but had to rely on his recovery play around the greens to preserve his score and he finished with a bogey six on the 18th			1
but he was in good spirits thursday night in a family occasion , tweeting : " having a great dinner celebrating my mums birthday ! " that optimistic mood would have been quickly shattered by his performance on the course friday morning			0
starting at the 10th hole , @entity1 was quickly in trouble , hitting his approach to the 11th into the water and running up a double bogey			2
a further bogey followed on the 13th before a disastrous display on the 16th where he found the water twice and ran up a triple bogey seven			2
three putts from 40 feet on the par - three 17th left him seven over for the tournament and with little chance of making the halfway cut before he found yet more water on the testing par - five finishing hole			2
it is the first time the 23 - year - old @entity1 has pulled out of a tournament			2
in later action , @entity88 battled to make the weekend on the cut line of level par after a second straight 70 with 23 - year - old rookie @entity91 leading the way on nine - under 131 after a superb seven - under 63			0
@entity93 slumped to a sorry 77 to miss the cut			0
@entity1 's stumbling start to 2013 is in sharp contrast to his dominant displays last year and comes in the wake of signing a lucrative 10 - year sponsorship deal with @entity100 , worth a reported $ 250 million			1
@entity11 : latest scores as part of the deal , @entity1 changed his golf clubs to play with @entity100 branded equipment , which is also endorsed by his great rival and @entity88			1
he has enjoyed his previous success , including two major victories , playing with rival @entity110 clubs			0
results since have not lived up to expectations and he missed the cut in @entity114 in his first tournament of the year			0
that was followed by a sorry first round exit -- @entity88 also went out on the same day -- at the @entity119 event in @entity120 last week			0
critics have also focused on the scale of @entity1 's new commercial ventures and three days before his @entity11 defense he signed a three - year deal with audio products and headphone manufacturers @entity128			1
on the eve of the tournament , @entity1 took to @entity131 again : " had a great time with the @entity128 crew at the launch of our exciting new partnership last night			2
looking forward to a great relationship			0
" @entity1 , who dates former @entity139 tennis player @entity138 , will get an early chance to silence the doubters as he is due to tee off next week in the @entity142 on @entity144 's daunting @entity143			1
it is all part of his preparation for a tilt at the @entity148 in @entity149 , one of his major targets for the year as he bids to build on a 2012 season when he topped the money lists on the @entity20 and @entity155 tours and claimed the @entity156 in stunning fashion .			1
