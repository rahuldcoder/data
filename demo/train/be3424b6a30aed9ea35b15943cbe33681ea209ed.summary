on march 19 , 2003 , @entity0 was invaded by an " alliance of willing states " headed by the @entity3 and @entity4			1
my @entity6 inspection team and i had seen it coming -- and i felt an emptiness when , three days before the invasion , an @entity3 official called me to " ask " that we withdraw from the country			1
while we were sad to be ushered out in the midst of a job entrusted to us by the @entity18 -- one that we were doing well -- there was a certain relief in knowing we had all made it out safely			0
we had worried that our inspectors might be taken hostage , but as it turned out the @entity0 had been very helpful during our time there			1
so it was that a few hundred unarmed @entity6 inspectors left @entity0 , to be replaced by hundreds of thousands of soldiers who began an occupation that would have a horrendous cost in lives , suffering and resources			1
full coverage : the @entity36 , 10 years on i headed the @entity6 inspections in @entity0 at the time of the war 10 years ago			1
today , i look again at the reasons why this terrible mistake -- and violation of the @entity6 charter -- took place and explore if any lessons be drawn			2
after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , @entity49 's administration felt a need to let the weight and wrath of the world 's only superpower fall on more evil actors than just @entity59 's @entity58 regime			0
no target could have seemed more worthy of being crushed than @entity0 's brutal dictator , @entity61			2
sadly , however , the elimination of this tyrant was perhaps the only positive result of the war			2
the war aimed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction , but there were n't any			1
the war aimed to eliminate @entity71 in @entity0 , but the terrorist group did n't exist in the country until after the invasion			1
the war aimed to make @entity0 a model democracy based on law , but it replaced tyranny with anarchy and led @entity3 to practices that violated the laws of war			1
the war aimed to transform @entity0 to a friendly base for @entity3 troops capable to act , if needed , against @entity85 -- but instead it gave @entity85 a new ally in @entity87			1
watch now : @entity0 's phantom @entity88 the @entity49 administration certainly wanted to go to war , and it advanced eradication of weapons of mass destruction as the main reason			1
as deputy secretary of defense @entity95 has since explained , it was the only rationale that was acceptable to all parts of the @entity3 administration			0
the @entity88 argument also carried weight with the public and with the @entity101			0
indeed , in the autumn of 2002 the threat seemed credible			0
while i never believed @entity61 could have concealed a continued nuclear program , i too thought there could still be some biological and chemical weapons left from @entity0 's war with @entity85			1
if not , why had @entity0 stopped @entity6 inspections at many places around the country throughout the 1990s ? however , suspicions are one thing and reality is quite another			1
@entity6 inspectors were asked to search for , report and destroy real weapons			1
as we found no weapons and no evidence supporting the suspicions , we reported this			0
but @entity3 defense secretary @entity122 dismissed our reports with one of his wittier retorts : " the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence			0
" @entity131 's logic was correct , i believe , but it was no excuse for the @entity3 and @entity4 governments to mislead themselves and the world , as they did , by giving credit to fake evidence or assuming that if weapons items were " unaccounted for " that they must exist			0
we inspected many hundred of sites , including dozens that had been suggested to us by various governments ' national intelligence organizations			0
in a few cases we found conventional weapons -- but no weapons of mass destruction			0
the governments that launched the war claimed to be 100 % convinced that there were such weapons , but they had 0 % knowledge of where these weapons were			0
i am not suggesting that governments should ignore information coming from their billion dollar intelligence programs			0
such information is indispensable and collected with many means that are not available to @entity6 inspectors			1
however , i think one lesson from the @entity0 war is that we should pay equal attention to the results of multimillion dollar international reports that are based on extensive professional inspections on the ground			1
in 2003 , the alliance of willing states did not do that			0
after the war it was reported that @entity175 and several others in @entity177 had had our offices bugged during this period			1
if i was bugged , as i find very likely , i regret that those listening in did not pay more attention to what i had to say			0
@entity183 : 5 lessons of the @entity36 fortunately , enough states did listen , and the @entity18 was saved from green - lighting a war that was justified by false evidence			2
the political leaders who have been criticized as responsible for launching the war on false premises have asserted that they acted in good faith , and that interrogation of leading @entity0 showed that the regime planned to revive its weapons program as soon as sanctions disappeared			1
i am not questioning the good faith of the political leaders , but rather their poor judgment in bringing war and death to a country on flimsy grounds			1
on february 11 -- less than five weeks before the invasion -- i told @entity3 national security adviser @entity204 i was n't terribly impressed by the intelligence we had received from the @entity3 , and that there had been no weapons of mass destruction at any of the sites we had been recommended by @entity3 forces			0
her response was that it was @entity0 , and not the intelligence , that was on trial			2
@entity215 : @entity0 suffocates in cloak of sorrow and during a telephone chat with @entity219 on february 20 , i told the @entity4 prime minister that it would be paradoxical and absurd if a quarter of a million troops were to invade @entity0 and find very little in the way of weapons			2
he responded by telling me intelligence was clear that @entity61 had reconstituted his weapons of mass destruction program			0
at any rate , whatever view one took of the evidence of weapons , no one could believe in 2003 that prostrate @entity0 was a threat to any other state			2
i can not judge whether @entity0 prisoners were sincere when they talked about @entity61 's intentions to revive weapons programs after the end of sanctions			2
they might have said what they thought their @entity244 interrogators wanted to hear			0
either way , the risk of a revived weapons program was remote and hypothetical -- and the @entity6 foresaw a system of reinforced monitoring to continue in @entity0 and to provide an alarm bell even after a lifting of sanctions			1
the most important lesson of the @entity36 , i think , has been that an overconfidence in military power has been replaced by an understanding that there are severe limitations on what can be achieved by military means			0
opinion : media 's failure on @entity0 still stings intervening swiftly with arms and crippling strikes might be easy for a great power , but achieving desired political aims is another matter and exiting may be hard -- the phrase " if you break it , you own it " comes to mind			1
@entity274 , @entity59 and @entity0 have been long and costly engagements with very mixed results			2
since then prudence has held the @entity3 back in the case of @entity279 and so far in @entity280			0
another important lesson is that today armed international interventions are likely to be condemned by much of the world unless they are clearly in self - defense or have been authorized by the @entity18			2
unless we remember this going forward , i fear there is nothing stopping this kind of tragedy from being repeated .			0

@entity294 : lead - up to war shows we must rely on international inspectors ' reports
war aimed to eliminate *non-existent* *wmd* , but ended up replacing tyranny with anarchy
@entity294 : invading a country is easy for great power , but achieving political aims is more difficult
@entity294 : it is likely my @entity6 office in @entity177 was bugged in lead - up to invasion of @entity0
