-- search - and - rescue dog handler @entity1 loves @entity3			1
that 's what the @entity5 calls its 52 - acre search and rescue training center in @entity8 , @entity9			1
@entity3 is a classroom for chaos -- a manufactured jungle of concrete , rebar and other rubble you might find in the aftermath of a hurricane or explosion or the 9/11 attacks			1
" it 's like a playground for first responders , " says @entity1 , a member of the @entity22 1 urban search and rescue team			1
" it 's like my second home			0
" @entity29 teams travel to the facility from around the nation to receive training certified by the @entity33			1
most of the trainees are human			0
hundreds of @entity33 canine teams have trained at @entity3			1
for 15 years , @entity1 has spent two weekends a month at the center working with dogs			2
that includes her golden retriever , @entity42 , one of the last surviving 9/11 search and rescue dogs			1
dogs and their handlers climb up and down the piles of concrete , hiding objects for canines to find			1
trainers teach and test the dogs to hone their smelling and searching skills by sending them down into simulated tornado shelters and up into second story buildings			2
back in 2001 , @entity1 and @entity42 ( pronounced , " @entity56 " ) were fresh graduates of @entity3 when they were deployed to @entity58 shortly after the @entity60 attacks			1
@entity1 joined hundreds of other search and rescue teams sent from around the world to find survivors at ground zero , working 12 hours a day for two weeks straight			1
we know now there were very few survivors found in the rubble of the twin towers , and @entity42 , like so many other searchers , worked hard -- only to find none			1
but @entity1 discovered something unexpected : rescuers and firefighters would approach @entity42 and pet her			1
soon they 'd be sharing their personal stories with @entity1 , describing the missing friends , loved ones and colleagues they were searching for			0
@entity42 had become a kind of therapy dog			1
" dogs can be so comforting , so it makes sense to me now , " she says			2
" i just did n't anticipate that , then			0
" @entity87 was only the first of many national disasters that called @entity42 and @entity1 into action			2
deployments followed for @entity92 , @entity93 and other storms			0
once @entity1 watched bretagne risk her own safety when the dog found herself standing on the end of a dangling staircase			2
" she walked to the edge of it and she stopped -- turned -- and she came back down , " @entity1 recalls			0
" she did exactly what she was supposed to do , but it scared me a bit			0
" despite all that training , @entity1 admits " there were still times when i held my breath and said , ' i hope she does this right			0
i hope she 's ok			0
' " pushy puppy it 's no coincidence that search and rescue dogs such as @entity42 succeed while working under such dangerous conditions			1
from the time they 're puppies , dogs must survive a rigid screening process before they can do this kind of work			0
when @entity1 spotted @entity42 , she had a feeling this dog might be right			1
sharing a plastic kennel with eight other puppies , @entity42 buffaloed her way through the pack from back to front , to greet @entity1			2
" that kind of pushy behavior helped her be the persistent do n't - give - up - style of working dog that i needed later , " says @entity1			0
a few other qualities @entity1 says are key to good search and rescue dogs : -- high toy drive : " their toy is their paycheck			1
we 're looking for the dog that 's going to be so over-the - top crazy for their toy that they 're going to be happy going over this rubble pile			0
" -- high prey drive : " they 've got to be persistent			0
they 're going to hunt for survivors , and continue to hunt , and not give up			0
" -- nerve strength : " we need dogs that are not going to be scared to climb a ladder up to the second story of a building -- alone without a handler â € ” or to go down into a dark tunnel			0
" -- focus : " the dog ca n't be concerned about a nearby jackhammer or loud truck or crane or emergency sirens			0
" @entity42 left @entity22 1 in 2009 to focus on her work as a local fire department search and rescue dog			1
then after a couple more years , it was time for her to retire altogether			0
but that did n't mean the end of @entity42 's public service			2
now 15 , @entity42 spends time once a week teaching kids how to read			2
she visits elementary school classrooms , where children , who " may be intimidated or uncomfortable reading out loud to their classmates , have an opportunity to develop reading skills by reading to her , " @entity1 says			0
@entity1 has raised and trained two other golden retriever search and rescue dogs : @entity177 , now 10 and retired , and @entity178 , age 3			1
@entity178 will continue the legacy that @entity177 and @entity42 have carried , dedicating their lives to helping people survive calamity			2
flying drones and other robotic technology provide new options for search and rescue teams , but @entity1 says dogs will always be a part of the toolbox , along with cameras and listening devices			1
" i do n't think there will ever be a substitute for their agility and sense of smell , " she says			0
" in that way , they 're better than any other tool that we have out there			0

@entity42 , one of the last living 9/11 search and rescue dogs , trained at @entity3
the @entity8 , @entity9 , facility is a realistic classroom for search and rescue teams
hundreds of dogs have and dog handlers have received @entity33 certification there
dogs must have *special* traits to succeed at search and rescue
