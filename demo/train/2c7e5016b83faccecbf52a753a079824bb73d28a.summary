imagine spending your entire career searching for something buried somewhere within the @entity5 -- and then when you miraculously find it , the federal government seizes your discovery			1
that 's the predicament paleontologist @entity8 found himself in after he and his team unearthed a nearly complete @entity11 skeleton in 1990 , preserved for some 67 million years in what is now the state of @entity14			1
it is the most intact @entity11 skeleton ever found			1
@entity8 and his team had permission from the rancher , @entity18 , to dig on his property			2
before they had fully unearthed the fossil and realized its significance , they paid @entity18 $ 5,000 for the discovery			1
" that was the most that any landowner had ever gotten ( for a dinosaur fossil in the ground ) , " @entity8 said			1
" we shook hands and he ( @entity18 ) was pretty excited about seeing it set up in the museum			0
" @entity8 and his team from the @entity35 in @entity14 had planned to showcase their discovery at the institute			1
but that never happened and @entity8 would soon find himself in the middle of a protracted legal battle that would result in him serving time in federal prison			1
flat tire leads to fossil find maybe if the 1975 @entity45 had n't gotten a flat tire			1
maybe if @entity47 had n't been so impatient -- or if she had n't gotten lost in the fog , the @entity11 skeleton would still be in that craggy @entity14 rockface			1
on the morning of august 12 , 1990 , the @entity52 fossil hunter team 's @entity45 broke down so @entity47 decided to venture out on her own on @entity18 ' ranch where the team had spent weeks searching for fossils			1
that foggy morning , she walked right into the discovery of a lifetime			2
" anybody who had any idea what a fossil versus a rock ( looked like ) would have seen it , " @entity47 said			2
" there ( were ) a lot of broken bones dribbling down ( and ) about 8 feet up the side of the cliff , there were three articulated vertebrae and a couple of other pieces of bone sticking out			0
" @entity47 immediately showed one of the vertebrae to her colleagues			0
amazed , @entity8 said he and the team " literally ran back to the site			0
" they nicknamed the @entity11 " @entity47 " after @entity47 , and spent the next few weeks carefully unearthing the fossilized skeleton after paying @entity18 for the find			1
the bones , still encased in plaster and earth , were transferred to the @entity35 where they began the long , arduous process of separating and preparing them for display -- a dream of @entity8 and his brother , @entity89 , also a member of his team			0
" ever since we created that little museum on our parents ' ranch , it 's always been our dream to have a museum here in @entity100 ( @entity14 ) , " @entity8 said , referring to the @entity35			0
" and finding @entity47 , the @entity11 -- here 's the anchor for the museum			1
" more than 80 % of the skeleton was recovered -- making " @entity47 " the most complete and largest @entity11 ever discovered			1
and the scientific impact was huge : one of the most interesting discoveries , according to @entity8 , was that the injuries to the bones indicated that @entity47 had died after being attacked by another @entity11			1
@entity8 said he and the entire town hoped that a public display of @entity47 would " put @entity100 on the map			0
" their excitement soon turned to outrage as federal agents arrived on the doorstep of the @entity35			1
whose fossil is it ? the morning of may 12 , 1992 , the @entity35 paleontology team was still riding high			2
they had just succeeded in separating the @entity11 's pelvis from its skull -- a process that took more than a year and , if done incorrectly , could have damaged the prized skull			1
" taking that hip off of @entity47 's skull was critical			0
... you do n't have a second chance , " said paleontologist @entity126			0
" one little movement ( and ) it could be cracking it all the way through inside			0
" around 7 that morning , @entity134 agents and the @entity135 arrived at the institute and seized @entity47 , the records related to the @entity11 and other documents from the @entity35			1
" i go down to the office and there 's two @entity134 agents sitting there ( saying ) ' you 've stolen this from federal land and we 're coming here to seize this , ' " @entity8 said			1
it took days for the federal agents to load up the fossil and during that time , @entity100 residents showed up to protest which attracted the attention of the national media			1
the " entire town of @entity100 ... was in mourning when they took that dinosaur away , " said @entity35 's office manager @entity156			0
even though the team had gotten permission and paid the landowner for the fossil find , @entity18 -- who died in 2011 -- had apparently changed his claim and said the fossil belonged to him , said @entity167 , author of " @entity168 " and @entity8 's ex-wife			2
in addition , it turned out @entity18 ' private ranch was part of @entity174 , which further complicated who owned @entity47			2
on top of that , five years before @entity47 's discovery , the @entity176 ( @entity176 ) had begun to investigate the @entity35 for illegally collecting fossils on public lands , said @entity176 senior geologist @entity182			2
" there was a civil matter that dealt with the ownership of @entity47 ... ( and ) there was a separate , criminal investigation that had very little to do with @entity47 , " @entity182 told @entity1			0
" i think ... the dinosaur overshadowed a lot of that discussion and ... created confusion			0
" navigating the tricky land laws were central to the federal case against the @entity35			2
for 18 months , @entity47 remained locked up as the federal government gathered enough evidence to charge @entity8 and the other members of the institute -- giving immunity deals to several employees and friends of the institute in exchange for their testimony			2
@entity47 was one of those given immunity -- but she said she had nothing incriminating to say because " they did n't do anything wrong			0
" the @entity209 and the @entity176 conducted the bulk of the federal investigation against @entity8 and the @entity35			2
@entity212 , the lead investigator for the @entity209 , said the evidence recovered at the institute was overwhelming			0
" there were so many bones , so many animals , so many invertebrates that were taken off of public lands , taken internationally , sold internationally			0
... there was way more than we ever could have investigated , " @entity212 said			0
he stressed that @entity47 " was n't ... what was being looked at as far as potential criminal violations			0
" @entity8 and his colleagues have denied taking fossils off of public lands			0
in november 1993 , a federal grand jury returned a 39 - count indictment containing 153 charges against @entity8 and five others linked to the @entity35 , including @entity126 and @entity8 's brother , @entity89			2
the 153 charges in the indictment included fossil theft , money laundering , and false statements to government agencies			2
none of the charges were directly related to @entity47			0
in fact , during the trial , the court instructed both sides and all witnesses to avoid discussing the @entity11			1
in the end , @entity18 made $ 7.6 million from the eventual auction of @entity47 , who was put on display at @entity249 's @entity248 -- and @entity8 served 18 months in federal prison for customs violations unrelated to the @entity11			1
after @entity47 today , @entity8 still runs the @entity252 in @entity100 , @entity14 , where his enthusiasm for @entity254 has n't abated			0
he and his team have found a total of 10 partial @entity11 skeletons			1
despite everything that happened to him and his team , @entity8 says he 's glad that @entity47 is on public display			0
he even went to the dinosaur 's 2000 unveiling in @entity249 as a guest of @entity47 's			0
he has n't given up on his dream of returning @entity47 " in some form " to @entity100 : he 's asking the @entity248 for a full research cast of the @entity11 " i think it 's probably the second best place she could have been , " he said , referring to @entity249			1
" people can see her and get the same excitement that i have for her			0
