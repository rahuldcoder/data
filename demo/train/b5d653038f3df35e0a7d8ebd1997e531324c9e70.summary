-- teams of investigators were out at daybreak wednesday examining damage to @entity2 's @entity7 after an unmanned rocket exploded shortly after launch on the @entity11 coast , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity1 told @entity0 via email			1
@entity2 is warning people in the area not to touch debris if they find any			1
the @entity19 rocket , built by @entity2 contractor @entity20 , and its @entity22 cargo spacecraft " suffered a catastrophic failure " shortly after liftoff tuesday evening , the company said			1
the crash caused a huge fire and scattered debris over a large area			1
@entity20 told @entity0 it would issue a statement on the status of the investigation later wednesday			0
the cargo module was carrying 5,000 pounds of supplies and experiments meant for the @entity34			1
officials say no one was injured or killed in the explosion , but @entity2 says debris may be scattered around the launch area and some may have fallen into the ocean			1
what happened ? the public is being warned to forget about grabbing up rocket debris as souvenirs			1
" it had a lot of hazardous materials on board that people should not be looking for or wanting to collect souvenirs over , " said @entity47 , a former @entity2 astronaut and now a manager at @entity20 " if you find anything that washes ashore in the local area or came down on your farm or in your yard ... definitely do not touch it and keep people away from it			1
" " there may be a possibility of debris washing up onto some of the beaches into some of the areas surrounding the island , " @entity62 , director of @entity2 's @entity7 , said a news conference tuesday			1
if people do find any debris , they 're being urged to call @entity2 at 757 - 824 - 1295			1
@entity2 says teams started assessing damage to @entity76 at daylight wednesday			1
" damage was contained to kind of the south end of @entity81 , " @entity62 said			2
" that 's predominately where many of the pieces came down			0
" opinion : @entity86 blow up ; we move on ' you see a big fireball ' the rocket lifted off at 6:22 p.m. et , but about six seconds after launch , there was an explosion and the rocket fell to the ground , engulfed in a huge fireball			2
it seemed to be going perfectly when @entity98 saw the launch brighten up the sky from his vantage point about 3 miles away			0
" and then , all of a sudden , you see a big fireball , " said @entity98 , a @entity102 reporter			0
he recalled a loud boom that caused " your feet ( to ) shake a little bit , " as well as flames enveloping a roughly 100 - yard area around the launchpad in a marshy area with brush			0
@entity114 , who watched from a drawbridge because the @entity2 visitors station was full , recalled a " breathtakingly beautiful " sight when the rocket ascended , followed by mass confusion as flames lit up the early nighttime sky moments later			1
" about 30 seconds later , we could hear and feel two booms reach us , and it was apparent the rocket had exploded , " she said			2
did you witness the rocket explosion ? please share your images @entity129 , a former @entity2 astronaut , said such a colossal fire was to be expected after the launch failure			1
" it takes a lot of propellant to take a spacecraft of that size moving 25 times the speed of sound , " @entity129 told @entity0 , explaining how fast the rocket should have gone on its way to the space station			2
" so when it fails , it 's usually pretty catastrophic			0
" @entity20 will lead the investigation into the explosion			0
@entity2 and the @entity144 will assist			1
" what we know so far is pretty much what everybody saw on the video , " @entity47 said			0
" the ascent stopped , there was some , let 's say disassembly , of the first stage , and then it fell to @entity155			0
... we do n't really have any early indications of exactly what might have failed , and we need some time to look at that			0
" they 'll examine debris and review video of the launch and telemetry from the spacecraft			2
" we have reams and reams of data that comes down from the rocket during launch , " @entity47 said			2
payload included student experiments the cargo included crew supplies , hardware for the space station , spacewalk equipment and several experiments designed by students			2
no classified payloads were on board the spacecraft , said @entity1 , the @entity2 spokeswoman			1
one experiment from @entity183 in @entity184 would have tested how pea shoots grow in space			0
the school said on its website that students , parents and teachers were shocked and disappointed by the explosion , but that it was n't a total loss			0
" the amount of learning that occurred as a result of being part of this program through the @entity200 ( @entity200 ) is incredible and the students and their teachers ... should always be proud of this accomplishment , " the school said			0
also lost in the blast was a study called @entity206 , which was designed to help learn more about blood flow in space , and an experiment called @entity210 , which may have helped find previously undetected meteor showers			0
the cargo also included more than 1,300 pounds of food for the space station			0
@entity2 four to six months ' worth of food is stashed on board , so there is no worry the crew will go hungry			1
also , a @entity221 progress resupply vehicle arrived at the space station wednesday			0
and @entity223 is scheduled to take up supplies in december			2
" the station is in great shape ; the crew is in good shape , " said @entity225 , the space station 's program manager			0
opinion : do n't overreact to rocket explosion @entity0 's @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 contributed to this report .			2
