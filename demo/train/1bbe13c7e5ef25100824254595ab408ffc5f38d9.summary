-- pope @entity1 has made clear that " wealth and income inequality is a moral issue " that needs addressing as a priority			1
expect president @entity6 to address that theme strongly during his @entity9 address tuesday -- but for very different political reasons			1
@entity6 will make economic inequality central to his 2014 agenda in his @entity9 on tuesday night			1
the president 's speech will be watched intensely not just in the @entity15 , but right across the world			1
this is because , right now , inequality is a very salient issue internationally			2
and , interestingly , it is not just politicians , but also other prominent figures ( including , most notably , @entity1 ) who are championing this agenda			2
less than a year into his papacy , @entity1 has already criticized what he sees as modern society 's " idolatry of money			1
" he has clearly stated that " wealth and income inequality is a moral issue " that needs addressing as a priority			1
and in a sign that @entity6 recognizes the growing international momentum behind this issue , the @entity32 last week announced that the president will travel to the @entity37 in late march			1
the talks will center around the " shared commitment [ of the @entity1 and president ] to fighting global poverty and growing inequality			1
" @entity6 's @entity9 address , and his march meeting with the @entity1 , will not just bring global attention to this agenda			1
it will also encourage campaigning on similar themes by politicians around the world , especially from the left of center			0
to date , mainstream left parties in many countries have failed to capitalize electorally , particularly in @entity55 , on the last few years of economic downturn that has been the most acute period of crisis since at least the 1930s			2
but , the fortunes of the center left could yet be on the turn			0
in @entity55 , for instance , @entity64 @entity63 leader @entity62 hopes to win office next year on a platform of voter discontent in the country over stagnant living standards			0
meanwhile , @entity73 's @entity72 leader @entity71 is championing a narrative of the struggling middle class in advance of the 2015 ballot in that country			2
and , in @entity80 , @entity63 leader @entity79 hopes to seize power by exploiting economic inequality issues in an election expected this year			1
meanwhile , in the @entity15 , the @entity32 calculates that a core economic fairness agenda has the potential to reboot @entity6 's flailing second term of office , and prove a winning national theme for the @entity89 in november 's mid-term congressional elections			1
to this end , @entity6 plans to use his address to build popular support , and also press for specific proposals to address income inequality , including extending jobless - benefits , and expanding the federal minimum wage to at least $ 10			1
professor @entity99 's fascinating research on the political consequences of the @entity101 , and the post 2008/09 @entity102 , is potentially illuminating about the left of center 's political prospects in coming years			0
he has shown that the electoral implications of both of these defining historical moments were similar to begin with : conservative parties generally performed stronger in ballots than the mainstream left soon after both economic crises began			0
as @entity99 asserts , this could be potentially explained , in part , by the fact that the initial trauma of both the @entity101 and @entity102 were widely perceived as so significant that many middle class voters cast their lot in with conservative parties which were seen as better able to tackle the crisis			0
in the two years after 2008/09 alone , for instance , center - left parties lost ground , or were jolted by significant electoral losses in countries in @entity126 ( @entity127 and @entity80 ) , to @entity55 ( @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , the @entity131 , @entity132 , the @entity64 ) and @entity133 ( in the 2010 @entity15 mid-term elections )			0
what is potentially even more interesting , however , is that @entity99 found that once the @entity101 was no longer seen by voters as a major continuing threat , the political pendulum tended to swing back toward parties of the center left			0
of course , it is by no means certain that history will repeat itself			0
@entity99 , for instance , notes that politicians of the mainstream left today have less new agenda setting ideas and policy options than in the 1930s when an era of expansionary fiscal policies and welfare programmes blossomed			0
nonetheless , the longer the legacy of the 2008/09 crisis continues to bite , from higher youth unemployment to stagnant living standards , the greater the opportunities could be for the centre left to benefit			0
now as in the 1930s , economic hardship is being felt in many countries not just by the poor , but also the middle classes			0
and , it is this discontent that left - of - center politicians , including @entity6 , @entity62 , @entity71 , and @entity79 , are seeking to tap into			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			2
