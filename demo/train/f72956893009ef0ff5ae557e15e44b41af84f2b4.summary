@entity1 journalist @entity0 began his last journey into @entity3 with a surprise gift for his fixer , @entity6			1
it was a small camera			0
" happy birthday ! " @entity0 told his guide , whom @entity0 had befriended a year earlier by interviewing @entity6 's father about the @entity3 civil war			1
then came the real surprise for the two men : about 15 masked @entity16 gunmen jumped out of three cars and took them captive , beginning a dark tale that eventually led to @entity6 's release , but ended in @entity0 's beheading			1
in an interview with @entity23 this week , @entity6 provided a detailed account of how he , @entity0 and three armed guards were abducted in @entity3 by @entity16 fighters in august 2013 , but since then , never once did @entity1 officials try to interview @entity6 about his first - hand experience with @entity16 and its captivity of @entity0			1
" no , nobody tried to contact me and i tried to help			0
nobody come to me and ask me any questions from the ( @entity1 ) government ...			2
nobody contact me or ask me about their conditions , " @entity6 said in occasionally broken @entity34			2
" and they can find me			0
but , no , nobody tried to contact me			0
" a @entity0 family representative who kept contact with @entity6 before and after his captivity reiterated the claims , saying @entity1 government or security agencies -- who were made aware of the fixer and his connection to @entity0 -- never talked to @entity6			1
" that was one of many mistakes , " @entity0 family spokesman @entity50 told @entity23			2
he declined to comment further			0
@entity6 's assertions that his abductors were @entity16 fighters could n't be independently verified by @entity23			1
@entity56 officials declined to comment directly on the accusations by @entity6 and @entity58 , but asserted they are investigating the @entity0 case			1
" the @entity56 is actively investigating the savage murder of @entity0 at the hands of terrorists and will not discuss investigative details at this time			1
we are committed to bringing the murderers of @entity0 to justice , " said @entity56 spokesman @entity64			1
@entity16 ' killing of @entity0 shocked the world because it was the second of three videotaped beheadings of @entity72 by @entity16 since last month			1
the first was another @entity1 journalist , @entity74 , last month			2
and then @entity76 aid worker @entity75 , this week			0
a survivor 's torment since @entity0 's decapitation , @entity6 has agonized over the fate of his journalist - friend and the fortune of his own release , as well as that of his brother and two cousins who went along as armed guards			1
" i was very angry , and after that i calmed down and was so , so sorry , " @entity6 said in an interview conducted in @entity89			2
" i put message on @entity92 ( to ) tell his mother i am so sorry ...			0
i did my best to save him ...			0
my feeling is so sorry , like i lost my brother			0
" he was nice man and good heart i just wish he can rest in peace now , " @entity6 added			2
@entity6 blamed a guard on the @entity89 - @entity3 border for possibly betraying @entity0 's whereabouts to an @entity16 contact			1
@entity23 contacted other journalists who worked with @entity6 , and they said he was an established fixer with a good reputation			2
" i think maybe one guard from the border , they call him on the radio , and he said he 's moved from here , you can wait for him : he has this kind of car , " @entity6 said			1
conscious of security , he did n't use his car that day and instead borrowed one , he said their harrowing abduction by @entity16 occurred just 20 minutes after @entity0 , @entity6 and his relatives as aides entered @entity3 , on august 4 , 2013 , @entity6 said			1
how it began the moment the journalistic team entered @entity3 , @entity6 called @entity58 to confirm the group was inside @entity3			2
@entity50 was staying in a hotel in @entity89			0
when asked why he did n't travel with @entity0 into @entity3 , @entity50 told @entity23 that " i can not go into details about that			2
" this trip was n't the first time that @entity6 worked as a journalistic " fixer " -- or a jack - of - all - trades guide who does translations and arranges interviews			2
he had 18 months of experience working with at least 100 other journalists , and he was charging @entity0 about $ 80 a day , he said			2
@entity6 had also been a rebel fighting for four or five months in @entity3 with the @entity138 brigade , a moderate @entity140 faction			2
he even got married in his combat fatigues in @entity142 , with comrades firing their weapons in celebration , in february 2013			0
that was six months before his ill - fated encounter with @entity16			2
when the masked @entity16 gunmen confronted @entity6 and his charges , @entity6 pulled out his gun , but he saw he was vastly outnumbered			1
" we were four people , and they are 15 , " @entity6 said			0
" we do n't have any chance to defend ( ourselves )			0
" how many more @entity72 captives is @entity16 holding ? knowing all the roads the @entity16 gunmen took @entity0 and his retinue to a textile factory on the outskirts of @entity142 , and that was the last time @entity6 saw @entity0			1
the captives were told to close their eyes , and one captor hit @entity0 with a gun and told him do n't look , @entity6 said			1
" i know all the roads			0
i know if they turn 500 meters , they turn left , they turn right ... , " @entity6 said			0
the captives were held individually in separate rooms , and @entity6 overheard one captor asked @entity0 for his passport , @entity6 said			1
at first , @entity6 did n't know who the abductors were because they had accents from @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 , he said			0
as days passed , he wondered whether he would survive the @entity179 extremists waging war in @entity3 and northeastern @entity181 in a quest to create a caliphate			0
" sometimes i say they will kill us all because i work with people from outside , " @entity6 said			0
after 15 days of captivity , @entity6 , his brother and their cousins were freed by their abductors			0
" they ask me , do you know who we are , and i said , yes , i think you are @entity16 , " @entity6 said			1
" and they said , yes , we should kill you			0
you are spy and work with @entity1 and @entity199 and @entity56 , but we leave you now because you work with ( @entity138 ) , because i have papers ...			1
but if we hear you work with journalist again , we will kill you for sure			0
" @entity0 's family believes @entity16 paid as much as $ 50,000 to rebels who alerted the militant group that the journalist had entered @entity3 , @entity50 said			1
@entity0 's family accuses @entity16 leader of violating @entity179 with execution apprising @entity0 's family once liberated , @entity6 met @entity50 several times to give him details about the abduction , @entity6 said			1
later , @entity6 often traveled between @entity89 and @entity3 , and he sometimes asked other former captives of @entity16 " if they know information about any journalist , " @entity6 said			1
" i go back inside ( @entity3 ) , and i try to make information , " he added			0
in fact , @entity6 heard one account that @entity0 was moved from the textile factory to an industrial center , also outside @entity142 , he said			1
he then heard another unsubstantiated account that @entity0 was moved again , this time to the @entity16 stronghold of @entity221 , he said			2
a year passed , and then @entity6 finally saw the news on the @entity223			0
@entity0 -- the journalist and one - time bearer of a birthday gift -- was barbarically killed by an @entity16 executioner masked in black			1
" i send message to world to say it 's not really @entity179 , " @entity0 said of the @entity16 killing			1
i say that to all the people			0
" @entity6 says he has now moved all of his family from @entity3 to @entity89			0
two months ago , he became a father for the first time			0
@entity0 has final word at his memorial service			0

@entity56 says it " is actively investigating the savage murder of @entity0 "
@entity6 says masked @entity16 gunmen outnumbered him , @entity0 , three armed guards
