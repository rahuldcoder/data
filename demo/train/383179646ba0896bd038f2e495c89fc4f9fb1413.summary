-- here 's a solid bet : at a few minutes after 6 p.m. on saturday , chef @entity2 will have goosebumps on his arms , and he 'll be in dire need of a nap			1
the 35 - year - old chef will have been at @entity7 since 5 a.m. , working with his teams to prep , among other @entity11 treats , 1,892 sheets of @entity13 , 18,000 barbecue sandwiches , 9,700 pounds of chicken , 11,520 @entity17 sausages ( including a bourbon version specially made for the event ) and 120,000 mint juleps to be served to more than 150,000 guests at the 136th annual @entity22			1
this is n't chef @entity2 's first time around the track , though			1
he 's worked in the @entity7 ' kitchens for four years , and this is his second stint as executive chef			1
he 's learned to pace himself			1
" it 's basically like a family reunion , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
" the food is coming in waves all day long			1
there 's breakfast , then second breakfast , then first lunch ... we 're taking our hats off to @entity40 here			1
you do n't know what to do with yourself , so you just keep eating , " @entity2 said			1
behind the scenes , hopefully , things will gallop right along			2
read preview of the @entity22 " i thrive on the energy in the kitchen , and i 've learned it 's like climbing a mountain			1
we train , test , pace , work and plan , " he said			0
that 's especially important this year , with his addition of some innovative new dishes alongside his family 's classic succotash recipe and the track 's standard barbecue , hot dogs and shrimp salad			1
the @entity67 native collaborates closely with nearby farmers to be able to introduce some fresh -- as in picked 15 to 20 minutes earlier -- new flavors in the form of " living greens , " which are sponge - grown lettuces plucked from their roots right before they 're served alongside @entity22 blue cheese			0
and " oh my goodness ! " he raves about local tomatoes from @entity76			0
i 'm taking what chefs are doing every day			1
i 'm just doing it for thousands and thousands of people			0
" he 's also thrilled to be working with meat supplier @entity17 , which raises all their animals hormone - free , humanely and sustainably on family farms			1
now about those juleps ... the track 's staff will go through approximately 475,000 pounds of shaved ice , 7,800 liters of bourbon and 2,250 pounds of mint to quench loads of thirsty racegoers			1
@entity2 notes that everyone has their own method			1
some people use simple syrup , and others steep mint on their bourbon			0
but when the silver cup is in his hand , he 'll grab a quantity of fresh @entity22 mint and , " i muddle really well with sugar -- which does a really good job of releasing the oils			0
and i like crushed ice because it makes it cold quicker			1
" and he 's got his crushing method down cold			1
no " chewy " little bits for him ; he takes a couple of cubes in the palm of his hand and strikes them with the back of an ice cream scoop			1
so when does he finally get a chance to chill out ? he 'll step out of the kitchen , right before post time and listen to the crowd sing " @entity121			2
" it 's his favorite part of the whole day , and he gets goosebumps every time			1
the moment it 's all over , it 's back to the races			2
he assesses the day 's performance and begins planning next year 's menu , without pausing to take a victory lap. like he says , " not everyone gets to be the chef at @entity7			1
" here are a few of the recipes used by @entity22 fans : simple @entity135 ingredients : 1 tsp sugar , handful of clean mint leaves and additional mint sprig , crushed ice , 3 oz of bourbon note : juleps are traditionally served in silver cups because they retain an even chill			2
if you do n't have one , a chilled tumbler will do just fine			0
spoon the sugar into the bottom of the cup			0
place the leaves on top of the sugar and crush , pushing down and twisting with a muddler or wooden spoon until slightly pulped			0
fill the cup with crushed ice , pour the bourbon over the ice , garnish with the mint sprig and serve			2
@entity164 's @entity163 @entity166 slush was standard on party buffet tables when i was growing up in @entity169 , @entity170 , but i 've rarely -- if ever -- seen it served outside of @entity170			2
that 's a real shame			2
here 's a fairly standard recipe that packs a solid , sneaky alcohol wallop , as it goes down so very smoothly			2
it 's easy to double , triple or quadruple , but fair warning -- you can never have enough on hand , because no one ever has just one			2
my husband and i sampled it at our annual @entity22 party as well as our wedding			0
now guests to subsequent soirees barely say hello upon arrival			0
even the most demure bee - line for the freezer to scoop out a drink and then start in with the pleasantries			0
ingredients : 12 ounces of lemonade , frozen concentrate ; 6 oz of orange juice , frozen concentrate ; 2 cups sugar ; 2 cups hot strong tea ; 2 cups bourbon ; 7 cups water ; ginger ale or lemon - lime soda to taste			0
in a lidded , freezer - proof container or two ( @entity206 and @entity207 pitchers work well ) , stir together all ingredients except ginger ale until thoroughly blended			0
the concentrate should not be prediluted with water , and plain tea like @entity213 or @entity214 works well			0
place the container ( s ) in the freezer overnight or for at least 4 - 6 hours depending on the make and model of your appliance			0
it should be firm all the way through , but it will not freeze completely solid			0
scoop around half to three quarters of a cup of the slush into a tumbler , top with ginger ale or lemon - lime soda to taste and serve			0
and did i mention how sneaky it is ? keep an eye on your guests , lest they slip too far into the slush pile			0
note : do n't splurge on the good stuff for this			0
save your @entity239 and @entity240 's for sipping and juleps ( and hand your @entity243 on over this way )			2
@entity246 is cheap , respectable and gets the job done .			0
