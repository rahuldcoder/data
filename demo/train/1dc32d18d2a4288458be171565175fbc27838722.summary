@entity0 -- federal health officials on thursday are unveiling a $ 54 million national media campaign to get smokers to quit and prevent anyone else , especially children , from starting			1
the campaign , called " tips from former smokers , " is intended to educate @entity10 about the dangers of smoking through the stories and graphic pictures of ex-smokers who have suffered severe health consequences of tobacco use			1
the former smokers profiled have suffered ailments such as stroke - related paralysis , limb amputation , lung removal and heart attack			2
one breathes through a stoma , a surgically created hole in the neck through which a person who has undergone larynx or voice box surgery can breathe			0
" hundreds of thousands of lives are lost each year due to smoking , and for every person who dies , 20 more @entity10 live with an illness caused by smoking , " @entity31 secretary @entity30 said in a statement			1
" we can not afford to continue watching the human and economic toll from tobacco rob our communities of parents and grandparents , aunts and uncles , friends and co-workers			0
we are committed to doing everything we can to help smokers quit and prevent young people from starting in the first place			0
" the ads are the brainchild of the @entity55 's @entity54			1
the agency says smoking remains the country 's leading cause of disease and preventable death , resulting in more than 443,000 fatalities annually			2
more than 8 million @entity10 live with a smoking - related illness or conditions , according to the disease agency			1
the combination of public service announcements and paid advertising for television , radio , newspapers and magazines also spotlights the dangers of exposure to secondhand smoke			2
the ads will also be featured on billboards , in theaters and online -- including on @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			0
" although they may be tough to watch , the ads show real people living with real , painful consequences from smoking , " said @entity55 director @entity83			1
" there is sound evidence that supports the use of these types of hard - hitting images and messages to encourage smokers to quit , to keep children from ever beginning to smoke , and to drastically reduce the harm caused by tobacco			0
" see the @entity55 anti-smoking campaign print ad ( @entity98 ) the campaign includes eight television ads ( one of them in @entity102 ) , seven radio spots in 30 - and 60 - second versions , seven print ads and five billboard and bus stop ads. the campaign marks the first time the @entity55 has run a paid , comprehensive national anti-tobacco advertising effort			1
the primary target is smokers ages 18 to 54 , but public health experts also said they hope it will dissuade children from adopting the habit			2
last week the surgeon general released a report on youth smoking , leading @entity30 to declare : " targeted marketing encourages more young people to take up this deadly addiction every day			1
this administration is committed to doing everything we can to prevent our children from using tobacco			0
" the agency said , " targeted messages and images that portray smoking as an acceptable , appealing activity for young people are widespread , and advertising for tobacco products is prominent in retail stores and online			2
" the need for such a campaign is urgent , according to the @entity140			0
" this media campaign is a smart investment that will reduce tobacco use , save lives and reduce tobacco - related health care costs , " @entity146 , president of the advocacy group			0
" the tobacco industry spends more than $ 1 million every hour on marketing that entices kids , discourages smokers from quitting and portrays its deadly and addictive products as normal and appealing			1
the @entity55 's campaign will counter the industry 's marketing with the harsh truth about tobacco use , told by former smokers themselves			1
" the @entity55 said the tobacco industry spends more than $ 27 million a day on marketing to kids and others -- about $ 10 billion a year			1
in two days , the industry spends about what the government has budgeted for the entire 12 - week campaign			2
the industry denies that it markets to children			0
tobacco giant @entity168 would not comment of the campaign , telling @entity1 : " @entity171 agrees smoking is addictive and causes serious disease			2
while we are not prepared to comment on @entity55 's anti-smoking campaign , preventing underage tobacco use , discouraging smoking initiation and promoting quitting remain important to reducing the harm from cigarette smoking			1
a complementary strategy , focused on the development of and appropriate communications about potentially lower risk tobacco products , may be one of the most meaningful actions that the @entity187 can take to reduce the health effects of smoking			0
" not in dispute is the deadly impact smoking can have on health			0
about a third of the smoking - related deaths in the @entity10 are linked to heart disease , according to the @entity196			1
" the ads highlight a shocking but very realistic fate that could await some current smokers if they continue their tobacco addiction , " said @entity197 , the association 's ceo			0
the ads note that smoking contributes to one in five strokes and increase the odds of having a heart attack			2
" @entity208 believes these graphic ads , coupled with vigorous tobacco control at the state level , will reach not only the adults who smoke , but also will break through to teens and discourage them from ever taking up this deadly habit , " she said			0
the @entity215 says nine of 10 smokers started before they turned 18			0
" combating tobacco use requires a multipronged approach , including federal regulation of tobacco products , increased tobacco taxes , smoke - free workplaces and sustained investment in prevention and cessation now and beyond the end of the @entity55 campaign , " said @entity217 , president of the @entity218 , in a statement			1
" this historic advertising campaign will help to combat @entity233 's unscrupulous efforts to addict new users and prevent existing users from trying to quit			1
" featured reader comments : should smokers be targeted ? the campaign begins less than a month after a federal mandate requiring tobacco companies to place graphic images on their products warning of the dangers of smoking was tossed out by a judge in @entity0 , who said the requirements were a violation of free speech			1
the @entity250 passed in 2009 would have required nine written warnings such as " cigarettes are addictive " and " tobacco smoke causes harm to children			0
" also included would have been alternating images of a corpse and smoke - infected lungs			0
@entity1 's @entity258 contributed to this report .			0
