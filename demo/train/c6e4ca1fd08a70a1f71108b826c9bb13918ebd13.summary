-- the president 's pick for @entity4 director -- @entity5 -- is one of a handful of @entity8 officials who understands @entity8 's covert drone campaign inside and out			1
nearly everyone else is in the dark about the whos , wheres and whys of the program , including most members of @entity18			0
but @entity5 is also one of the few @entity8 officials who 's stood in front of a public audience and tried to explain the targeting of terrorists outside recognized battlefields			1
and while overseeing a massive use of lethal force , @entity5 is also known inside the administration as a moderating voice in the fight against terrorism			1
the fact is , @entity5 's personal views are as opaque as the drone campaign itself			1
he may assume leadership of the @entity4 and decide a clandestine agency should not conduct what is an obvious military operation ( a stance i and many others would fully support ) ; after all , a veteran of the @entity4 may believe the agency should get back to gritty intelligence gathering			2
@entity0 explains : @entity8 drones or , maybe @entity5 believes that when it comes to the fight against @entity46 , the public and its @entity18 should trust the executive office to protect the @entity8 people by whatever means it sees fit			1
one way or the other , this week 's @entity52 confirmation hearings should be an opportunity to bring @entity5 's views out of the shadows , along with the basic attributes and justifications of the covert drone campaign			1
the man , the machine and the policy are inextricably linked			0
@entity63 : @entity5 , @entity8 's drone warrior @entity8 officials have consistently claimed that offering too many details about the covert drone program could threaten national security			1
fair enough ; some classification for national security is understandable			0
but the secrecy surrounding covert drone use is unduly excessive and not in keeping with the transparent government president @entity74 promised			0
since the bulk of @entity5 's hearing will be behind closed doors , the @entity75 has no reason to shy away from asking tough questions about the drone program			1
it matters that @entity18 is there to represent the @entity8 people			2
on their behalf , @entity18 has a duty to ensure the use of lethal force beyond our borders is being considered and carried out responsibly , with due consideration for the harm it may inflict on civilian populations			0
talk back : should @entity8 be able to kill @entity8 terrorist suspects without trial ? senators might ask a very basic question to @entity5 , one that is seldom clearly answered by the administration : " what impact is the drone campaign against @entity46 and its associates having ? " this is a fundamental question of accountability any @entity8 official involved in setting or carrying out counterterrorism policy should be able to answer			1
that answer may describe a dwindling kill list , but it must also put forward facts about what impact drones are having on civilians living under them			2
@entity8 armed forces in @entity114 and @entity115 learned that the positive or negative impacts of an operation on the local population are an important metric of mission effectiveness			2
commanders worked hard to reverse anti-american sentiment caused by a seemingly callous @entity8 attitude toward civilian deaths and injuries			2
in the case of counterterrorism operations , palpable anger toward @entity8 would be antithetical to the goal of decreasing the number of terrorists and those who support their cause			2
as it stands , it 's unclear whether anyone , including @entity5 , knows what negative consequences are emerging on the ground because of remote drones			1
rather , claims of low civilian casualties and drone precision capabilities paint a picture of extreme effectiveness in taking out terrorists while sparing civilians			2
it 's true that a drone is precise , meaning it will hit what it is aimed at -- a building , a bunker or a person			2
but there are valid concerns about whether the target hit is the right one			0
opinion : when are drone killings illegal ? remote drones likely rely on sources that may be questionable such as video and cell phone intercepts to identify a target			2
civilians may be mistakenly targeted as combatants and counted as such because there are no ground troops to conduct a battle damage assessment , interview witnesses or properly identify bodies			0
civilians may also get caught up in so - called " signature strikes " in which operators target individuals based on behavior , not on known identity			0
this is legally questionable but also has real ramifications for civilians living under drones			0
if a civilian in @entity182 does n't know what behavior makes him a target for @entity8 drones , he can not fully protect himself and his family			1
if a drone harms his family , even mistakenly , our research shows they wo n't receive an apology , explanation or any help from the @entity8			1
certainly there will be no love lost for @entity8			0
any deaths and injuries are compounded by psychological trauma , displacement and fear and suspicion among neighbors			0
one @entity182 told us , " we fear that the drones will strike us again			0
... my aged parents are often in a state of fear			0
we are depressed , anxious and constantly remembering our deceased family members			0
" gen. @entity211 , the former commander of international forces in @entity114 , recently noted , " what scares me about drone strikes is how they are perceived around the world			0
... ( @entity215 ) he resentment created by @entity8 use of unmanned strikes ... is much greater than the average @entity8 appreciates			0
they are hated on a visceral level , even by people who 've never seen one or seen the effects of one			0
" the drone program needs to come out of the shadows , with explanations about who is a civilian , who is a target , and how drone operators distinguish between the two			1
the @entity4 should get out of the drone operation business , handing it over to the @entity235 , which has a culture of learning lessons , accountability to @entity18 and a new openness about civilian protection after 10 years of war in @entity114 and @entity115			1
drone operators should be trained in civilian protection best practices , and any civilian harmed should receive recognition and help for their losses , in accordance with the values @entity8 policymakers have espoused about humanity even during times of war			1
the @entity52 may confirm @entity5 as head of the @entity4			1
it should also confirm where he stands on government accountability for lethal force and the @entity4 's role in the remote drone program			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .			0

@entity5 's confirmation hearing is a chance to ask about drone program , author says
@entity260 : @entity5 is one of a few officials who knows full story on drones
she says senators need to ask about damage drone program does to civilians , @entity8 *reputation*
@entity260 : @entity4 should hand over drone program to @entity235
