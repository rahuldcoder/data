-- fantasy role - playing takes a staggering step forward as " @entity3 : @entity7 " lurches along with uneven visuals and spotty artificial intelligence but a combat system that is easy to learn and even easier to use			1
the first @entity3 electronic game ( @entity9 , @entity10 ) that features use of the new @entity13 rules from @entity14 , " @entity7 " allows players to create and develop a character from first level , much like the classic tabletop version of @entity3			1
ability scores , hit points , attack and damage rolls are all part of making up your character , but without the use of any dice			1
there are four base characters : male human fighter , male dwarven cleric , female elven rogue and male halfling wizard			1
you can not mix and match : no female elven fighters or male human rogues			1
each race and class has its own bonuses and class abilities to help perform their actions			1
the adventure begins in a dwarven mine overrun by goblins			1
as with any @entity3 campaign , the story builds from there into a rousing battle with a major enemy at the end			1
there are major quests that help move the main plot along and minor quests that offer opportunities to earn more gold and experience points			1
experience points are the backbone of character development , allowing for increased abilities , powers and weapons			1
only one quest can be tackled at a time			2
once you start one , you need to complete that mission before moving on to the next			2
this often results in a lot of back and forth through some of the same areas			2
gold and weapons can be gathered from fallen enemies or from barrels that seem to be everywhere and in every setting			2
improved weapons , armor , rings , amulets and potions can also be purchased from local merchants			2
sounds like a typical @entity3 game , right ? visually , the game conveys the fantasy setting well			1
the dwarven mine appears foreboding but does n't quite reach the creepy darkness it could have			2
a jail also is well - lit when it could have been a better mood - setter with some lighting adjustments			2
a mini-map in the upper right - hand corner was very helpful in pointing to merchants , non-player characters who might send you on quests and the locations of those quests			1
a larger map was easily accessible using the character menu			2
player characters appear different as they don different armor and hold different weapons			2
enemies look unique from type to type ( e.g. , a minion looks different from a controller ) and can be readily identified by appearance alone			2
each enemy has a small box above its head that lists out what it is , what level of power it possesses , how many hit points it has and other information			2
of course , in a traditional tabletop @entity3 game , these things would be hidden so players would n't be able to target weaker foes first in order to whittle down the opposing forces			1
the information box would sometimes appear if the enemy were hidden around a corner , thus ruining any surprise that could have occurred			2
there were also instances in which there would be an info box but no enemy			0
enemy artificial - intelligence was also hit and miss. although the overall tactics of groups of enemies was good ( minions charged as their archers and magic - users pinged from afar ) , they would also stand in place as i lobbed fireball after fireball at them			1
those battles were less than epic			0
however , combat was pretty good all in all , and that 's where i thought the game shined over its table - top counterpart			1
i played through the single - player campaign as the halfling wizard , and switching from normal weapons to spells was incredibly easy			0
all four buttons on the controller can be mapped directly to weapons , spells or potions			0
there are four more locations that can be used by pressing the left trigger button ( @entity166 ) or the @entity168 button ( @entity169 ) and then utilizing the standard buttons			0
spells had cool - down times after casting , so you could either stand there and get pounded or find another way to attack as you powered back up			0
as i increased in levels , more spells became available so i could fire off spell after spell in a cycle			0
action was quick and intense			0
battles did n't last very long against weaker opponents and were appropriately longer against stronger opponents			0
there are some " boss " battles before the final conflict , and those required some use of tactics ( run - and - gun ) to be successful			0
my biggest gripe about the game has to do with when those tactics fail and you die			1
in single - player mode , there are healing potions you can carry with you to regain hit points			0
there are also clerics in the settlements who will heal you for free			0
however , there are occasions during a quest when an enemy gets some really good hits in , and , in the heat of battle , you lose track of your hit points , and you die			0
here is the gripe : no matter what stage you are at in the quest , you have to restart it from the beginning			0
there are no checkpoints during the quest			0
there are no " save and reload " points other than in between quests			1
although this is very much like the table - top version of the game ( dead is dead , after all ) , it was insanely frustrating from a video - gaming standpoint			1
on more than one occasion , i completed a rather lengthy fight , defeated multiple big bad guys and got killed on the way back to the quest - giver ( having forgotten to heal myself on the way )			0
this was particularly maddening during the climactic battle , in which you have to defeat multiple high - level characters in rapid succession			0
get through some but lose in the last one ? too bad			0
if playing with a party of characters is more your speed , there is a co-op mode that allows for up to four players to combine talents toward the common good			0
the enemies are stronger , and the loot gets better with more people			0
completing the game 's main quests can be done in less than four hours ( a good length for a @entity3 campaign ) , but doing all the side quests will add some time to your play			1
overall , " @entity7 " was enjoyable but a bit buggy			0
the story and combat were good and made for an exciting experience			0
the spotty visuals and enemy ai weighted down the overall fun , but not enough to make me want to stop playing			1
is it good enough to live up to the @entity3 name ? depends on how much actual roleplaying you like to do			1
there is little to none to be had here			0
interactions with other non-player characters happen largely in grunts and subtitles			0
no dialogue exists other than during cut - scene cinematics			0
it wo n't replace your tabletop game , but it might give you some good ideas how to run your next campaign while allowing you some enjoyment along the way			1
" @entity3 : @entity7 " is available now on the pc and through the @entity289 and the @entity290			1
this review was done playing the @entity289 version as a halfling wizard in the single - player campaign .			1

" @entity3 " has uneven visuals and spotty artificial intelligence
video game is much like the table top version of @entity3
completing the main quests can be done in less than 5 hours
