-- for those craving to look like the young rock star fashionistas lighting up the billboard charts , copycat fashion blogs may be the cure			1
as @entity8 sassily questions people trying to steal her style in her popular song , " @entity12 , " " did you copy that , copycat ? " female musicians of all genres have long been regarded as fashion icons , and today 's music scene is no exception			1
@entity20 , @entity8 , @entity21 and even wild child ke $ ha are inspiring trends tending toward the outrageous -- and people are looking for some outrageous in their life , it seems			1
" what i love about @entity8 's style is that she is not afraid to push the envelope , " says @entity26 , one of @entity8 's stylists			1
" she is less concerned with what people ' will think ' and more focused on how she is feeling at that moment -- how she wants to be seen for that event , rather than dressing for what she thinks people will want to see her in			0
i love that she has almost encouraged and used hair and makeup as an accessory			0
" want to wear a kaleidoscope of color like @entity8 ? start with the hair			1
according to @entity26 , wig sales , especially the bright color variety , are booming			0
" @entity8 never takes herself too seriously , which makes this outlandish fun style really approachable , " @entity26 says			1
" she incorporates tons of humor into her style , and is fearless in her approach , which i think people really admire and appreciate as an artist , a woman and a rising icon			2
" the fashions of rising icons are n't far from becoming your own street style reality			2
while copycat fashion is n't a new trend , the clothing inspiring these trends can feel unattainable or impossible			1
fortunately , " impossible " does n't exist for blogger @entity67			0
an interior design graduate of the @entity69 , @entity70 , 27 , is the founder of style with @entity67			2
" i love taking a crazy @entity20 outfit and translating it to daywear , " @entity70 says			1
" it looks great on stage , but most of us are n't on stage			0
this way , you can channel your own inner @entity20			1
" based out of @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity70 is no stranger to celebrity fashion			2
she began her blog two years ago to prove a point : the interior designer also knew as much about dressing people as she did staging a living room			0
because of her own obsession with @entity20 's fashion , @entity70 says she began posting " how to dress like " female musicians and celebrities			1
then came a flood of e-mails asking " can you do a ke $ ha post , too ? " and other similar requests			1
as someone who loves to dress other people , @entity70 jumped on the challenge of copycat fashion			1
@entity70 has the mind of a designer			0

for example , if @entity20 is wearing an outfit covered with feathers , @entity70 recommends finding a cool feather necklace to add some funk to your wardrobe			1
if an outfit completely mystifies you , just look at the fabric or material and base your search on that , @entity70 says			0
so what does @entity70 see as the drive behind all the requests she receives for her popular " how to @entity132 " posts ? " it 's fun to change up everyday style , " @entity70 says			2
" it takes the focus off everything else going on in the world			0
we can use what we already have in our closets and funk it up , even just with accessories , to express ourselves			0
people want something to be inspired by			0
" if you 're cautious about wearing @entity20 or ke $ ha swag in the workplace but still want to emulate a style icon , try for something that fits your tastes , @entity70 says			1
" for the average fashion - inclined person , @entity152 has a sophisticated style that is calm enough to translate to the normal working world , " @entity70 says			1
although a @entity20 fan , @entity70 does n't neglect other musicians in the name of being one of @entity162 's " little monsters , " the nickname given to @entity20 fans			1
under the @entity167 and @entity168 section , there are " how to dress like " collages for a multitude of artists and celebrities , and even a section for men under @entity69 for @entity175			0
however , some female rockers and songsters already wear styles that are easily attainable			2
even if " teenage dream " queen @entity21 attempts to be elusive , you can simply steal her style with @entity183 's blog			1
a fan of the band @entity185 , @entity183 wanted to create a website to show her appreciation , but not just another fan site			0

the latter has more than 60,000 unique visitors a month			0
" i never expected it to be a big thing , " @entity183 says			0

' so , i made a site for everyone , something that is all - encompassing			2
