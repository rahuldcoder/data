@entity0 , @entity1 -- it began as an annual festival to host local poets in and around @entity0 but thanks to the power of technology the ancient art of @entity1 story - telling is spreading around the world			1
a poetry collective decided to set up @entity13 , which in @entity14 means change			1
its aim is to celebrate the spoken and written word through online radio and live performance			1
broadcasting from @entity1 , poet @entity21 and her colleagues are spreading their reach far beyond this corner of the continent			0
" the reality is that even if you are doing fantastic work and nobody gets to read it or gets to hear you on a mic or gets to see it on a screen you might as well not be doing it , " @entity21 said			2
@entity21 says the project is the first of its kind			0
she explains that it is not just for fans of spoken word but also a meeting place for @entity43 poets			1
as well as the online radio , artists can submit work on the web and listen to others for inspiration			1
from @entity1 to @entity51 to everywhere in between there are more than a hundred pod - casts archived on the site in the hope of redefining the way people think about @entity1 poetry			2
@entity21 and her team work with the poets to help them upload the audio of their work			1
the archive of podcasts also features the poets profile along with the text of the poem			1
if it 's not in @entity68 it will come with a translation for the reader			0
@entity21 says until now there have not been enough spoken word role models and a lack of documentation of @entity1 poets			1
she hopes the group will inspire young poets and story - tellers across @entity1 , as well as providing them with a global stage			1
" i think what also @entity80 and a range of other poetry projects are doing is rectifying mis - education , in our continent especially we 've had a very @entity88 diet , on page and only from quite an academic perspective around what poetry is , " she explained			0
" learn from the pioneers and the skill and the trends that have been there but also what is your voice , what is your indigenous voice and the places you come from , your individuality , " she continued			0
@entity1 artist changing lives with street murals the idea began as a poetry festival in 2008 before becoming an online archive and later an internet radio channel in 2010			2
@entity21 says that the festival 's reach was too small and a bigger platform was needed			2
the main idea behind allowing poets to upload their own podcasts was to provide a global stage for @entity1 writers , an opportunity that @entity21 says they have n't had in the past			1
the group also tries to explore the poetic form as a tool for social activism and provide a space for discussion and debate through expression			0
" what i believe i am is a healer , using poetry as my first medium , i come from a theater background , i sing as well and perform with musicians and video artists who do projections , so poetry for me is a very holistic , multiple medium - kind of expression , " she said			0
@entity21 says when she and the other poets founded the collective a few years ago they never thought it would get as popular as it is today			0
she says she did n't realize there was such a need for an outlet like this			0
" @entity1 poetry on the @entity1 continent is thriving , it 's the visibility and the audibility of it that is something i 'm hoping we aspire to with @entity13 , " she said			2
" we ca n't all fly , we ca n't all be on every stage , we ca n't all be in the media spotlight , but how do we recognize the treasure and value of what is here and what is constantly evolving , this medium is immediate , it brings it home and to the globe at the same time , " she continued .			0

@entity13 broadcasts spoken word online from @entity0
the group also hosts a website for poets to upload their own podcasts
the *organizers* hope to give aspiring young poets a platform to *showcase* their work
