-- when the @entity3 app for the @entity4 had finally been released late wednesday night , there was a collective rejoicing from @entity7 fans worldwide -- many took to @entity9 and @entity10 to relish in the news and download it immediately			1
not at all surprisingly , the app quickly soared to the top of the free apps list in the @entity16			0
but with expectations beyond high for @entity3 to swoop in and save the day from @entity7 's unreliable , problematic maps app -- which replaced the existing @entity3 app in september with the rollout of the new @entity22 software -- many just hoped @entity3 's version would live up to promises of being a superior mapping platform for the @entity4			1
see also : @entity3 soars to @entity28 on the surface , it would n't have to take much to beat out the @entity31 app , which had been widely criticized for omitting transit directions , giving poor navigation and displaying incomplete @entity35 views that distort national monuments , such as the @entity37			1
not to mention the broken roads and satellite views that display nothing but clouds			0
the good news , however , is that the @entity3 app is excellent			1
but not perfect -- some are reporting issues with direction accuracy as well			1
overall , users will have to choose to access it over @entity31 which already comes on the platform			0
here 's a look at how the two stack up : accuracy @entity3 has years of experience perfecting data accuracy and the latest app shows it			1
when typing in an address in the @entity59 area , it quickly identified our location and presented us with the target destination , even when a vague address was used			0
however , some users have expressed frustration with direction accuracy so far , but the reports are nowhere near the inaccuracy outcry caused after the launch of the @entity31 app. @entity31 was slammed for accuracy issues right out of the gate in september			0
the hits just kept on coming , too -- police in @entity75 recently issued a warning not to rely on @entity31 since it was steering users to areas far from their destinations and in one case , misdirected a group of people who became stranded in dangerous terrain with no water			0
@entity7 worked for years to build trust in its users that its products just work ( always ) , but this set the company back a bit			2
now , people love to talk about how much they hate the @entity31 app. ( @entity7 ceo @entity91 has since fired the manager in charge of apps )			2
@entity95 a perk for both platforms : voice - assistant @entity98 can help users out with directions via @entity31 , while @entity3 's platform also features voice guided turn - by - turn navigation			1
this was rumored to be a big point of contention in why @entity3 was kicked off @entity107 in the first place , but now both services have it -- an effective draw			2
public transportation one of the biggest gripes about @entity31 was that it did n't come with public transportation directions			0
@entity3 not only provides detailed instructions on how to get from one point to another , it also gives estimated times of arrival for the next train and pinpoints when you will arrive at a destination			2
interface , @entity124 the @entity3 interface is sleek and more organized than ever before			2
users can select a home and work address within their profile to keep it on hand and quickly get directions			0
but say what you want about @entity31 and its accuracy issues , it 's hard to deny its interface is gorgeous and touts some impressive features			2
for example , by accessing the satellite view in @entity3 for cities such as @entity59 , @entity141 and @entity142 , users are treated to 3d imagery			0
attention to detail is so spot on that it almost looks like you 're flying through streets as though you were in a video game			0
although @entity3 incorporates @entity152 and @entity35 views via @entity153 , as well as the rotating and tilting of maps with gestures inside the app , we still prefer @entity7 's design			1
one - stop shop @entity3 has made a poignant effort to become a destination spot on the @entity4			1
typing in the name of a business not only reveals directions on how to get there , but additional information that may be of interest			0
for example , @entity3 has partnered with such as @entity169 and @entity170 to provide users with a full look at restaurant reviews , menus , photos and making reservations			0
this capability is not yet available via @entity31			0
developer integration as a bonus for developers -- and app users alike -- @entity3 announced @entity182 for @entity107 , which gives app developers the opportunity to use maps within apps for the @entity187 , @entity4 and @entity188			1
this will help users easily search and get the directions they want while using other apps and ultimately strengthen @entity3 's maps reach			1
final destination while @entity31 excels in some ways ( 3d rendering in particular ) there are just too many arrows in @entity3 ' quiver -- especially now that it 's brought turn - by - turn navigation to its @entity202 public transit , street view and easy searching propel @entity3 to a clear victory -- for now			1

review : new @entity3 for @entity4 puts @entity7 's maps to shame
new offering is superb , but not perfect
accuracy , navigation and public transit all better on @entity3 's tool
@entity7 *dumped* @entity3 on its newest operating *system* , @entity22 6
