-- @entity3 president @entity2 's ruling party paid the price for a weak economy in midterm elections as the opposition @entity7 rolled to victories in the lower legislative house as well as state and local posts			1
@entity3 president @entity2 was n't on sunday 's ballot and has three years left in his six - year term			1
with more than 99 percent of the votes counted , the @entity7 had 36.7 percent to 28 percent for @entity2 's @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , the state - run @entity15 news agency reported monday			1
the leftist @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , which nearly won the 2006 presidential election , came in a distant third with 12.2 percent of the vote			2
in response to the defeat , @entity17 president @entity23 @entity22 resigned from the top party post monday			1
on the ballot were seats for 500 federal legislators , six governors and about 500 mayors and local legislators in 11 states			0
though @entity2 has three years left in his six - year term and was not on the ballot , analysts said monday he was held responsible for @entity3 's problems amid the global economic downturn			1
" he got a beating because of the economy , " said @entity38 , a television and radio political commentator in @entity41			0
" the government in power pays for it , " said @entity44 , president of the @entity46 - based @entity45			0
besides the economy , @entity2 has had to face the consequences of a drug war he launched that has left more than 10,000 people dead since he came to office in december 2006			2
he also had to deal with the h1n1 flu pandemic that first became known in @entity3 this year			2
the @entity17 has the most seats in the @entity57 and the @entity58 , the lower house of @entity3 's @entity59 , but it does not have a majority in either			1
the party lost its lead in the lower house , as the @entity7 will hold more seats when the new delegates are seated in december			1
no seats were at stake in the @entity57 , which elects its members every six years			0
@entity2 acknowledged the setback in a late - night address to the nation sunday			2
" the federal government recognizes the new composition of the @entity58 since it is a sovereign decision of the citizens			0
i congratulate who they have chosen , " @entity2 said , adding he will work with the new representatives			2
he will have no choice but to work with the resurgent @entity7 , analysts said			1
but since the @entity17 did not have control of either house of @entity59 , @entity2 has been compromising and making deals with the @entity7 and other parties since coming to power			1
" i do n't think the job is much more difficult than it was at the outset , " @entity44 said			0
" it 's all a matter of degrees			0
yeah , it will make it a little more difficult			0
but he has had to work through negotiation anyway			0
" still , analysts said , the @entity7 now wields considerable more power			1
" they 're in a position to run @entity59 , " said @entity95 , director of the @entity97 's @entity96			0
by forming temporary coalitions with the @entity100 and other minor parties , the @entity7 can block presidential vetoes , @entity38 said			2
" they pretty much have control over the purse , " she said			0
much more is at stake for the @entity7 though			2
after having held the presidency from 1929 to 2000 and then losing it to the @entity17 in the last two elections , the party is looking for a path back to power			1
sunday 's results were particularly significant because the @entity7 finished third in the 2006 presidential election			1
" the presidential campaign has started as of today , monday , " @entity38 said			0
also significant was the @entity18 's apparent collapse as a major party , considering it came within 1 percent of winning the presidency in 2006			1
that race was so close that the results were not verified until a controversial decision two months later			0
losing candidate @entity122 refused to accept the results and announced himself the winner			0
fistfights broke out in the @entity58			0
the @entity7 drew away votes from the @entity18 in sunday 's election , @entity44 said , noting that may help @entity2 because the @entity18 is @entity2 's main foe in @entity59			1
working with a larger @entity7 may be easier			2
but @entity95 said @entity2 is on a deadline , until the 2012 presidential race really heats up			2
" his window of opportunity is for the next year and half , " @entity95 said			0
" the @entity7 wants to show that they can lead , that they 're a party of ideas			1
" no one knows if the @entity7 is up to the task			2
" the big question is whether the @entity7 will look forward only to the presidential elections , " @entity44 said			2
" the @entity7 has to show that they 're responsible and capable of governing again			1
" to do so , the @entity7 has to make sure that internal fighting over who will run as the presidential candidate in three years does not paralyze the party			1
" do n't underestimate the ability of the @entity7 to cannibalize itself , " @entity38 said			0
@entity7 leader @entity143 has emerged as a major power broker			0
as head of the party and newly elected member of the @entity58 , she will lead the @entity7 's legislative efforts			1
that 's good for @entity2 , @entity38 said , because it will be " much easier to negotiate with her than with other factions of the @entity7			1
" but if the @entity17 and @entity7 ca n't agree , @entity95 said , " there will be a breakdown of consensus politics			1
" @entity3 's leaders -- regardless of party affiliation -- also have to battle apparent disenchantment among everyday @entity3			1
voter participation sunday was about 30 percent , officials said , but more 5 percent of those were people who " annulled " their ballots			0
they turned in a ballot but did not vote for anyone or defaced the ballot			0
their intent was to show that they cared enough to vote , just not for anyone on the ballot			0
" it 's a repudiation of what is going on in @entity3 in general , " @entity38 said			1
@entity95 sees " a general skepticism , " saying , " @entity3 have tired of where things are going			0
