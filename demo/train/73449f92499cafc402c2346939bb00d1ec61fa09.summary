@entity3 outclassed their opponents from the first whistle and led after four minutes when @entity1 skipped away from @entity53 's challenge and blasted high into the net			0
goalkeeper @entity55 kept his side in it until halftime , making several saves as the @entity61 controlled possession and created chances at will			0

but the night belonged to @entity1 , who was restored to the starting lineup as @entity3 ditched the unusual 4 - 6 - 0 formation employed against @entity11			1

flamboyant striker @entity106 kept his place up front and looked dangerous , but he failed to convert the several half - chances that came his way before being substituted on 68 minutes			0
@entity11 's star performer was veteran midfielder @entity27 , who was at the heart of his side 's fluent passing game and gave them a deserved lead on 33 minutes			2
after @entity106 has been fouled 22 yards from goal , @entity27 stepped up to curl a wonderful free - kick over the wall , beating @entity22 goalkeeper @entity119 at his near post			1
