@entity3 forces committed egregious violent acts against ethnic @entity6 in the early 1990s , but they do n't equate to genocide , a @entity1 court ruled tuesday			1
the 153 - page ruling from the @entity9 means that modern - day @entity3 will not have to pay restitution to @entity6 , which in 1991 split from what was then @entity12			2
the decision relates only to the two national governments ' responsibility to one another , not the culpability of any individuals for targeting members of an ethnic group			0
such individual cases are handled by the @entity22 for the @entity12 ( @entity23 ) , another @entity1 court			2
" @entity6 has not established that the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the ( @entity3 ' ) pattern of conduct ... was the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , the @entity32 group , " the @entity9 ( or @entity9 ) ruled			2
" ... it follows ... @entity6 has failed to substantiate its allegation that genocide was committed			0
" in addition to dismissing @entity6 's case that its citizens had been victims of genocide , the @entity9 also rebuffed @entity3 's counterclaim that @entity6 forces had committed genocide against its own citizens			1
this all relates to what happened in the 1990s , in the bloody aftermath of @entity12 splintering into separate nations			0
many of the most horrific allegations have been levied against those aligned with the @entity12 government -- the closest equivalent to what is now the @entity3 -- for its actions in @entity55 and @entity56			0
in fact , several @entity3 have been charged with genocide , though none yet specifically tied to actions inside @entity6			2
they include @entity61 , sentenced to 46 years after the @entity23 convicted him in relation to a five - day slaughter of up to 8,000 @entity64 in the town of @entity66 in what 's been called the worst atrocity in @entity69 since @entity70 former @entity72 president @entity71 became the first sitting head of state to be indicted by a @entity1 tribunal when he was charged with 66 counts for crimes against humanity , genocide , and war crimes , though he was found dead in his cell before his years - long trial in front of the @entity23 finished			2
ex-bosnian @entity3 leader @entity83 is still on trial for two genocide charges and nine others related to ethnic violence during the breakup of @entity12 in the 1990s			0
when @entity93 's own trial on 11 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity opened in 2012 , the former general -- who is accused of orchestrating a horrific campaign of ethnic cleansing -- showed no remorse , even appearing to threaten victims in court			0
yet even as such individual cases push forward , courts have been reluctant to hold governments involved in the conflict directly responsible for genocide			0
in 2007 , for instance , the @entity9 acquitted @entity3 of committing genocide in @entity56			0
but , in the same ruling , the @entity1 court did find @entity3 guilty of failing to prevent genocide in @entity66			1
tuesday 's @entity9 ruling relates specifically to what @entity3 forces did in @entity6 between 1991 and 1995			1
the violence began when @entity3 troops went into @entity6 ostensibly to aid armed ethnic @entity3 trying to create their own autonomous states there			0
the @entity1 court considered reams of evidence , from both sides , about what happened in the years that followed			1
and some of what happened , the @entity1 court ruled , was consistent with genocide			1
for example , the @entity9 found @entity3 and allied forces responsible for a " large number of killings " that disproportionately affected @entity6 , " which suggests that they may have been systematically targeted			1
" the forces also " injured ( ethnic @entity6 ) and perpetrated acts of ill - treatment , torture , sexual violence and rape ( that contributed ) to the physical or biological destruction of the protected group , " according to the court			1
croats were singled out in other less lethal ways , like restricting their movement to create " a climate of coercion and terror " and spur them to leave , the @entity9 said			0
the court did n't find sufficient evidence , however , to implicate @entity3 forces on other grounds , like depriving @entity6 of food and medical care			1
but even if some of the acts could fall under the umbrella of genocide , there must be evidence of intent -- that the forces went in aiming to destroy a group of people -- in order for these actions to be labeled genocide under the so - called @entity162 , which dates to 1948			1
that was not proven , in the eyes of the @entity9			0
" in view of the fact that dolus specialis has been established by @entity6 , " the court said , using the legal term for a specific intent , " its claims of conspiracy to commit genocide , direct and public incitement to commit genocide and attempt to commit genocide also necessarily fail			1
" accordingly , @entity6 's claim must be dismissed in its entirety			0

a @entity1 court finds that @entity3 forces did commit large - *scale* killings , other violent acts
but there 's not enough evidence showing intent to commit genocide , the court rules
the same court dismisses @entity3 's counterclaim that @entity6 committed genocide
