-- from a distance , it is its shiny exterior that first catches the eye			0
as you step closer , a rooftop solar panel , an outdoor security light and a roof overhang make @entity10 's shack stand out amid the sprawling cluster of makeshift wooden structures and rusty corrugated iron dwellings where her neighbors live			1
welcome to the @entity16 , or improved shack , an innovative approach to housing that 's being tested in the windswept slum of @entity21 , just outside @entity22 , @entity23			1
the dwelling , developed by researchers at the @entity26 , is intended to raise the living standards of slum residents while improving their access to electricity and protecting them from extreme temperatures in an environmentally friendly way			2
read : ' solar sisters ' spreading light in @entity23 the @entity16 prototype is occupied by @entity36 and her three young children			1
it is fully equipped with a photovoltaic panel capable of producing enough electricity to power three lights , a mobile phone charger and an outdoor motion detector spotlight			1
its windows are strategically placed to achieve better air circulation and sunlight heating , while the roof is sloped so that rainwater can be harvested during the winter months			0
recycled cardboard boxes and old @entity53 containers are used for insulation between the exterior zinc surface and the interior , while a flame - retardant paint is used to lessen the risk of fires			0
inside the shack , rows of recycled bricks create a sturdy flooring base and act as " thermal mass , " protecting against temperature change			2
@entity67 , a domestic worker employed once a week , says her family 's life has improved a great deal after relocating to the ecologically designed @entity16			1
their previous home was a cold , damp shack hastily put together from disused pallets and corroded zinc sheets			2
a leaking roof , bare earth floor and lack of windows made conditions even tougher , while the shortage of electricity meant that @entity36 would often miss out on important calls about work as she could n't always walk long distances to charge her phone			1
" now i am available all the time and it is helping me to make more money , " @entity67 told @entity16 's developers			1
she added : " the solar [ lights ] are better			2
now we do n't need to go to sleep early anymore because now we have lights			2
my daughter must do her homework now , she does n't have any more excuses			0
and i like the light outside because we can see what is going on , i feel safer			0
" read : harnessing pedal power to light up @entity23 according to @entity104 , 62 % of the urban population in @entity103 lives in slums , which it describes as being typically characterized by deplorable living conditions , a feeling of insecurity and inadequate infrastructure for basic energy , sanitation and water services			1
in @entity23 , thousands of informal settlements have sprouted up in recent decades on the urban perimeter			0
to deal with the pressing housing problem , the government has shifted its emphasis from building new brick and mortar houses toward in - situ upgrading of existing informal settlements and providing access to services			0
but the @entity16 's developers say that slum dwellers usually have to wait for years for power and water grids or low - cost housing to arrive			1
they say that a growing housing backlog , coupled with budgetary constraints and a surge in urbanization rates , means that poorly serviced dwellings are likely to be part of urban living in @entity23 for years to come			2
" shacks are becoming the new norm , " explains @entity137 , one of the developers of @entity16			2
" so what can we do today in order to improve the living conditions of people through energy intervention , lighting , cell phones , communication , upping security ? " that 's where the planning comes in and the technology takes it one step further			1
" the developers say the project is a cost - effective solution that shows what communities can achieve in the short term			0
excluding the solar power system , the @entity16 costs about 5,600 rand ( $ 660 )			1
the typical cost of a shack in @entity21 can vary from a few rand , when somebody collects materials at the landfill and carries them back to the settlement , all the way up to 5,000 rand ( $ 582 ) on the informal real estate market , says @entity137			0
" the rationale is that over time the additional cost upfront will be recouped through reduced fuel bill [ and ] greater wellbeing , " he adds			0
read : @entity177 takes on @entity178 now , thanks to a grant by the @entity182 , the @entity16 project will be trialled over the next year			1
up to 100 shacks will either be built or retrofitted to determine whether the system can be applied on a larger scale			0
@entity137 says that as the project grows , community members trained in maintaining and repairing the solar power systems will be able to sell affordable energy to other residents			1
this will help them earn a living and also pay for new batteries for the @entity194			0
" we need to encourage the informal settlers , the slum dwellers , to invest into this infrastructure themselves , " says @entity137			0
" we can not rely on a passive population to simply sit there and expect governments to solve their problems , so we need to make sure that any investments that they 've made wo n't become redundant in the future			0

the @entity16 aims to improve living conditions for people in slums
the ' shack ' is equipped with a solar panel that can power lights and a mobile phone charger
the project will be scaled up using a grant from the @entity182
@entity219 *habitat* : more than 60 % of @entity103 's urban population lives in slums
