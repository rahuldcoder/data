-- the outrage over the @entity3 's conduct in targeting certain tax - exempt groups is based on a misunderstanding			1
obviously , mistakes were made in how the @entity3 examined the groups , but what should not get lost amid the resulting hue and cry is that this is fundamentally about disclosure of donors , not tax - exempt status			1
first of all , the @entity3 is to a certain extent in the " targeting " business			2
the agency 's job -- like it or not -- is as an enforcer			0
it is supposed to go after tax scofflaws			0
it has to look for clues in tax returns and other materials to find the cheaters and dodgers			0
in the current scandal , the method of the " targeting " -- searching returns for names like " tea party " as indicators of possible misfeasance -- was a mistake			0
but it does not follow that the @entity3 should not have been looking at these and other groups as a class , without regard to political affiliation			1
@entity41 is the question of what the @entity3 is looking for			2
because the @entity3 is the cop guarding tax - exempt status , we think that the @entity3 is supposed to be deciding whether a group should be granted the " privilege " of tax exemption			1
it follows that we would and should be outraged if the @entity3 grants or denies the " privilege " because of an organization 's political beliefs			1
this is not really what the @entity3 is doing when enforcing the tax laws in this context			1
to be clear : tax exemption here is not much of a privilege and is not the main issue			2
tax - exempt status is offered by many parts of the tax code and not primarily to bestow some special tax break on an organization because of its function			1
here 's a breakdown : 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) charity process for @entity71 : must apply to @entity3			2
scrutiny required because of other tax benefits charities receive			0
@entity75 : performs a public benefit , lessens burdens of government			0
501 ( c ) ( 4 ) social welfare , 501 ( c ) ( 5 ) labor union , 501 ( c ) ( 6 ) process for @entity71 : not required to apply to @entity3 but can self - declare exempt status			1
generally for a nonprofit purpose			0
527 political organization process for @entity71 : must notify @entity3 ( but approval not required )			2
@entity75 : historically always exempt on contributions -- seen as a pass - thru entity			2
the exception is for charitable organizations , i.e. , 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) s , which do have heightened standards for tax exemption			0
but the extra scrutiny here is less because of tax exemption and more because of other tax benefits that flow from tax - exempt status , such as the ability to receive tax - deductible contributions			1
importantly , charitable organizations are not allowed to engage in any political activity , because @entity103 long ago decided that charity and politics are incompatible			0
for noncharitable groups like the tea party groups , organized on a not - for - profit basis , tax exemption flows almost as a matter of course			2
tax exemption is not viewed primarily as a subsidy of the federal government but more as a matter of administrative convenience			0
many nonprofit groups do not have much income , would not owe much tax , and so tax exemption is not that much of a " benefit			2
" this is why such groups are not even required to apply for tax - exempt status but rather can just hold themselves out as tax exempt and simply start filing annual returns as an exempt group			1
if this is true , however , then why does the @entity3 care about any group applying for exemption as other than a charity ? well , the question for the @entity3 here is not really one of whether a group is tax exempt but under which part of the code the exemption will come from			1
will a group be " tax exempt " under one part of the tax code , e.g. , as a section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) " social welfare " organization , or under another part , e.g. , as a section 527 political organization ? both sections offer a form of tax exemption			1
but the big difference between the two has nothing to do with taxes			0
rather , it has to do with the disclosure of donors			0
for reasons of campaign finance law ( not tax law ) , public disclosure of donors is required for political organizations but not for social welfare organizations			1
and this brings us to the current scandal			0
after the @entity170 's @entity169 decision , it became possible for a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organization to engage in unlimited amounts of political spending			0
it thus also became possible for a political organization to use the tax law to hide the identity of donors			1
after @entity169 , the abuse the @entity3 is tasked with policing is whether an organization that claims to be a " social welfare " organization is in reality a political organization in disguise			2
so the @entity3 , when faced with a deluge of new applications for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) status , rightly had to decide whether some or many of these groups were actually political organizations , tax - exempt under section 527 , and so subject to disclosure rules			1
primarily for reasons of campaign finance law , the @entity3 has been put in the position of deciding whether a group is primarily political			1
this is not a job the @entity3 is good at or ever will be good at			0
and as we have seen , it is not a job that we want the @entity3 to have			0
@entity103 has the power to level the playing field on disclosure and should take action to do so			0
this will allow legitimate nonpolitical social welfare organizations to enjoy their appropriate tax status and return section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) to the backwater of exempt law it once was			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			0

@entity218 : the outrage over the @entity3 's conduct is based on a misunderstanding
@entity218 : the issue is fundamentally about disclosure of donors , not tax - exempt status
he says that after ruling , political groups can use the tax law to hide identity of donors
@entity218 : the @entity3 should not be put in the position of deciding whether a group is political
