" all right , good night			2
" those are the last words heard from the cockpit of @entity2			1
who said them ? was it the captain or his first mate ? or someone else in the cockpit with them ? officials in @entity12 suspect it was either of the pilots -- and that one or both was involved in @entity2 's disappearance on march 8			1
and according to the @entity20 prime minister 's account of events , by the time those words were spoken , someone had likely already taken steps to alter the flight 's path -- intentionally			1
@entity20 investigators are not ruling out a hijacking by other actors			2
but they have searched the homes of the pilot and co-pilot			1
information from international and @entity20 officials indicate that the @entity35 passenger jet may have flown for hours after that last voice contact with the pilots			1
the duty of all pilots is to aviate , navigate and communicate , in that order , an aviation expert has told @entity42			1
someone may have kept aviating , but either they could n't -- or would n't -- communicate			1
this is what we know about the 53 - year - old pilot captain and his 27 - year - old first mate			1
capt. @entity51 police had been outside his @entity20 home every day since the plane vanished , a source told @entity42			2
but had not gone inside until recently			2
when they did , they probably found a flight simulator there			2
in a @entity61 video he apparently posted , @entity51 can be seen sitting in front of one			0
and in a @entity67 online forum for simulator enthusiasts , @entity65 , there is a post from november 2012 in his name that says he built it himself			0
" about a month ago i finish assembly of @entity72 and @entity73 with 6 monitors			0
" the message was signed capt. @entity51 boeing 777 malaysia airlines			0
@entity72 and @entity73 are over-the - counter flight simulator games made by @entity78			0
on friday , the ceo of @entity80 said that everyone is allowed to pursue their hobbies			0
@entity51 , a pilot with 18,365 flight hours under his belt , is reportedly also a flight instructor			1
on the same @entity61 channel , @entity51 gives workman 's tips on tinkering with a refrigerator and an air conditioner			1
@entity42 can not verify the authenticity of the social media posts			0
1st officer @entity94 @entity42 's aviation correspondent @entity95 once visited @entity2 's 1st officer @entity94 in a @entity80 cockpit , when he was training			1
@entity97 watched him land the plane under supervision of a senior pilot in february			1
the captain described @entity94 's landing as textbook perfect			1
@entity94 joined @entity80 in 2007			0
he has 2,763 flying hours behind him and was transitioning to the @entity35 777 - 200 after finishing training in a flight simulator			1
as with @entity51 , not much is known to the public about @entity94			0
but @entity97 was not the only guest who had joined him in the cockpit			1
passenger @entity110 got an invitation to check out the cockpit during a flight from @entity114 to @entity20 -- one that @entity94 was flying with another pilot			1
she took photos and said @entity117 and his colleague smoked in the cockpit			1
after @entity2 's disappearance , she reported her experience to journalists			1
" we are shocked by these allegations , " the airline said			0
such a practice would be illegal on @entity127 carriers after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , but not necessarily so on international ones , @entity97 said			1
exploring the possibilities does @entity132 ' story open up the possibility that a third or fourth person could have joined @entity51 and @entity94 in the cockpit ? like the exact whereabouts of flight 370 , that 's yet unknown			1
but investigators believe that somebody must have done something			0
not long after the flight took off from @entity147 communications systems were disabled , the plane 's transponder was turned off , @entity20 prime minister @entity142 said saturday			2
that last device is situated between the pilots and can be shut off with a twist of the wrist			2
for a pilot to turn it off would seem reckless because the information it transmits gives the plane vital protection			2
it helps people on the ground locate the plane			0
someone would have to know how to do it and also know the plane would lose that protection			0
then someone in the cockpit said good night			2
and the apparent lack of visibility on radar ? " airline pilots are not trained for radar avoidance , " said aviation expert @entity168 , a former 777 pilot			1
they like to stay on the radar , because -- again -- it protects their plane			0
only military pilots , he said , are usually keen on avoiding radar			2
the father of a passenger on the missing plane is hoping for an outcome that would sound shocking under normal circumstances			0
" i hope the plane was hijacked , because then , at least , there is hope , " @entity183 from @entity184 said			0
he did not give his full name			0
@entity183 is waiting at a @entity190 hotel with dozens of other passengers ' family members awaiting word on the fate of their loved ones			0
" but if the worst happened then i will have no meaning in my life			0
this is my only son , " @entity183 said			0
as he walked away , he bent his head and cried			0
@entity201 : what happened to @entity2 ?			0

by the time of last voice contact , something was likely already awry
@entity127 officials indicated the jet may have flown for hours after last contact with the pilots
pilot 's duties : @entity216 , navigate , communicate ; communication cut off
was a third person with them in the cockpit ? one pilot has let visitors in before
