-- the first time , it happened almost by accident			0
just hours after delivery , a baby born with @entity5 in @entity6 was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs			1
more than three years later , doctors say the little girl has no evidence of the life - threatening disease in her blood , despite being off medication for nearly two years			0
now doctors say another child born with the virus appears to be free of @entity5 after receiving similar treatment			1
the case report was presented at the annual @entity20 in @entity21 this week			0
the girl was delivered at @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , last summer to a mother with @entity5 who had not received antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy			1
doctors gave the baby high doses of three drugs -- @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 -- four hours after birth			1
eleven days later , the virus was undetectable in her body and remained undetectable eight months later			0
the @entity25 baby is still on antiretroviral treatment , so it 's too soon to tell if the child is actually in remission			1
" taking kids off antiretroviral therapy intentionally is not standard of care , " said dr. @entity45 , a virologist with @entity46 who has been involved in both cases			0
" at this time , there is no plan to stop treatment			0
" while doctors around the world are trying to duplicate the @entity6 case , more research needs to be done before new standards are implemented for treating babies born with @entity5			1
" this has to be done in a clinical trial setting , because really the only way we can prove that we 've accomplished remission in these cases is by taking them off treatment , and that 's not without risks , " @entity45 said during her presentation at the conference			1
a clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of early treatment on infants born to hiv - positive mothers is set to begin in the next couple of months , she said			1
infants will be started on a combination of antiretroviral therapy within 48 hours of birth and followed " for an extended period of time to determine if the virus can be eradicated from their bodies , " according to the @entity86			1
the results could be a game changer in the fight against @entity90			0
timeline : @entity90 moments to remember the @entity6 baby the child in @entity6 was born to a mother who received no prenatal care and was not diagnosed as hiv - positive herself until just before delivery , according to a case report published in october in the @entity100			1
researchers : toddler cured of @entity5 " we did n't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able to do , to prevent transmission to the baby , " said dr. @entity103 , a pediatric @entity5 specialist at the @entity104			1
doctors administered the antiretroviral drugs 30 hours after the girl was born in hopes of controlling the virus			1
within a couple of days , @entity103 confirmed the child was @entity5 - positive			2
she said the baby had probably been infected in the womb			0
the child remained on antiretroviral drugs for approximately 15 months			1
her mother then stopped administering the drug for some reason , @entity103 said			0
in march 2013 , researchers announced that the girl was the first child to be " functionally cured " of @entity5			1
a " functional cure " is when the presence of the virus is so small , lifelong treatment is not necessary and standard clinical tests can not detect the virus in the blood			1
@entity103 told @entity0 the timing of intervention -- before the baby 's hiv diagnosis -- may deserve " more emphasis than the particular drugs or number of drugs used			2
" the researchers believe " the very early therapy is blocking the spread of @entity5 into viral reservoirs that hold the virus for a lifetime , " @entity45 explained			2
high - risk exposure researchers have long known that treating hiv - positive mothers early on is important , because they pass antibodies on to their babies			0
all hiv - positive moms will pass on those antibodies , but only 30 % will transmit the actual virus , said dr. @entity155 , an immunologist at the @entity156 who worked closely with @entity103			0
and @entity5 - positive mothers who are given appropriate treatment pass on the virus in less than 2 % of cases			1
" so all babies are born antibody - positive , but only a fraction of babies born to hiv - positive women will actually get the virus , and that fraction depends on whether the mom and baby are getting antiviral prophylaxis ( preventive treatment ) or not			1
" newborns are considered high - risk if their mothers ' hiv infections are not under control or if the mothers are found to be @entity5 - positive when they 're close to delivering			2
usually , these infants would get antiviral drugs at preventive doses for six weeks to prevent infection , then start antiretroviral therapy , or @entity178 , if @entity5 is diagnosed			1
@entity178 is a combination of at least three drugs used to suppress the virus and stop the progression of the disease			2
but they do not kill the virus			0
tests showed the virus in the @entity6 baby 's blood continued to decrease and reached undetectable levels within 29 days of the initial treatment			1
@entity5 may be ' functionally cured ' in some the ' @entity190 patient ' researchers say the only other documented case of an @entity5 cure is that of @entity194 , known as the " @entity190 patient			1
" in 2007 , @entity194 , an @entity5 - positive @entity196 living in @entity197 , was battling both leukemia and @entity5 when he underwent a bone marrow transplant that cured not only his cancer but his @entity5			2
in an interview last year , @entity194 told dr. @entity202 , @entity0 's chief medical correspondent , that he was still @entity5 - free			2
" i 've been tested everywhere possible , " said @entity194 , who now lives in @entity203			0
" my blood 's been tested by many , many agencies			0
i 've had two colonoscopies to test to see if they could find @entity5 in my colon , and they have n't been able to find any			2
" but @entity194 's case is apparently unique			0
and the procedure , which is extremely dangerous , wo n't work in most patients because the bone marrow he received had a special genetic mutation that made the stem cells in it naturally resistant to the virus			0
researchers tell @entity0 only 1 % of @entity218 -- mostly @entity220 @entity219 -- and no african - americans or @entity222 have this particular mutation			0
in june , five years after he was " cured , " reports surfaced that " traces " of the virus had been found in @entity194 's blood			0
even then , some @entity5 experts said that does n't matter , that he 's been cured			2
in fact , many @entity90 experts said they believe @entity194 has experienced what 's called a " sterilizing " cure , meaning the virus has been eliminated from the body entirely			0
in july , @entity21 researchers said two @entity5 patients showed no sign of the virus in their blood following bone marrow transplants			2
however , researcher dr. @entity240 said in december that the virus had returned .			0

baby born with @entity5 in @entity25 appears to be free of the virus
she was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs shortly after birth
case is similar to @entity6 baby " functionally cured " of @entity5
a clinical trial designed to test effectiveness of this treatment is starting soon
