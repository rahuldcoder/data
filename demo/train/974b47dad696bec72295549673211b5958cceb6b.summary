-- when the ground began to shake in @entity3 on march 11 , 2011 , @entity1 was in the office of his creative management agency			2
some 200 miles north , a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake had struck off the coast of the @entity8 , triggering dozens of aftershocks and a tsunami that sent 30 - feet high walls of water crashing across fields , flattening entire towns and propelling debris miles inland			1
more than 15,000 people died and over 20 times that number were displaced by the disaster			1
it was the largest ever earthquake to hit @entity20 and the fourth biggest on record worldwide			1
@entity1 spent much of that day checking on his loved ones and colleagues -- professional photographers , makeup artists and models , many of whom had family or friends in @entity8			1
" i strongly felt i had to do something and anything i could possibly do , " the father of two said			2
in the days that followed , his employees returned to their hometowns and confronted the aftermath			0
@entity1 's own grandparents lived in @entity37 , a coastal city in @entity38 that was completely wiped out by the waves			0
" of course , we did something for our families , but at the same time , we started to think about what we could do for others , " he said			0
two months later , on may 14 , @entity1 and some of his colleagues began what would become known as the @entity46 -- or " @entity47 in @entity48 -- traveling to the worst - hit areas of @entity20 to pamper the tsunami survivors who had been left to live in temporary evacuation shelters			1
the group , which organizes activities like hair and makeup sessions and face painting for children , has helped to bring smiles to the faces of those who have endured extraordinary hardships			2
the volunteers capture these small moments of joy in photographs , hoping the survivors ' remarkable resilience will serve as an inspiration to others			1
over the last three years , the group has visited around 180 shelters across @entity8			1
they have a core group of several dozen volunteers who visit the region twice a month , but as many as 2,000 people have contributed to their mission			1
community building @entity46 donates the photographs to the survivors , many of whom lost their possessions in the disaster , but the activities have also helped build a sense of community among those living in the shelters , according to @entity1			1
for him , one of the most memorable images was taken on the group 's first visit to the region , on may 14 , 2011			1
it 's an image of two middle - aged women with beaming faces , embracing -- their two enormous grins forming creases around their eyes			0
" they seem to be very close friends , " @entity1 said			0
it was only later that his team learned the pair had never met before that day			0
one woman lost her house in the tsunami and the other , whose home was spared , had visited the shelter to assist			2
it was only through the @entity46 's activities that they crossed paths and became good friends			0
the project seeks to draw attention to the plight of the people of @entity8 , more than 200,000 of whom still live in temporary accommodation three and a half years after the earthquake struck			1
" in summer or winter it 's really quite harsh -- even inside of the housing it gets really cold , " said @entity123 , a volunteer responsible for event planning and promotion			0
" they do n't even know how much longer they have to live ( like this ) , because the housing situation in @entity8 is not progressing as easily as initially planned , so they 're living in quite a challenging , harsh environment			1
" @entity1 says that many of those living in the shelters are " tired , stressed , physically and mentally exhausted			2
" " but from our experience , we know that our activities can lighten up their day a little and make them smile , even for a few seconds			0
" " if we know we can do something positive , we just have to do it and ( not give up ) , " he said			0
scars remain the group 's work is far from over			0
six months ago , when a team of @entity46 volunteers visited one of the shelters , a girl approached them and said : " how can i smile when i lost my dad and grandpa ? i really do n't like photographs			1
" " it was quite a shock , " said @entity1			0
" after three years of project activities and more than 5,000 smile photographs , we thought that people ( were starting ) to recover slowly but surely			2
but the fact was , there are scars on many people 's hearts still			2
" @entity1 and his team are determined to keep the project going " until everyone can get their smile back , " even if that takes decades			0
" we will not do it for them , but we will do it together with them , " he said .			0
