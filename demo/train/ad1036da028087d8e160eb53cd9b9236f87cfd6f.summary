-- @entity1 snicker over the sordid details of rep. @entity4 's internet escapades			2
but they pity his wife , @entity5			2
they see an accomplished and beautiful woman betrayed by her husband 's @entity9 posts			1
and she 's pregnant ? the details just get worse and worse			2
@entity5 and other political wives before her have been forced to face the public flogging of their husbands , heightened in this case by the technological evidence that @entity4 left behind and by the helpful testimony of his correspondents			1
@entity1 love to debate the role of the wronged political wife			1
what will @entity22 , @entity23 , or @entity25 's wives ( pick one ) do ? what should they do ? actress @entity29 was nominated for an @entity30 for her portrayal of " @entity32 " on @entity33			1
will she ever leave her fictional cheating husband ? to which author @entity35 says , " stop			1
" stop calling these women victims			1
unless there are threats to her physical safety or financial security , only @entity5 decides if she is a victim			2
( and she 's not talking publicly			2
) when her own husband , suffering through a midlife crisis , threatened to break up their marriage to end his pain , @entity35 chose not to play the victim			1
instead she planned a summer of joy for herself and her two kids -- and her husband when he wanted to join them			1
she gave him six months to work through his crisis			1
how did she stop herself from pleading with him or simply dumping him just to get it over with ? how did she choose a third way ? @entity35 , author of the memoir " this is not the story you think it is , " had recently committed to the end of suffering			1
after years of writing novels that were n't published , the death of her father , and therapy , she decided that she -- not anyone else -- would decide her own happiness			1
the same philosophy can apply to not - so - famous women facing infidelity or other crises that destroy their dreams and upend their lives			0
these crises can be opportunities to find your true calling , says @entity76 , author of " the wisdom of a @entity78			1
" if you do n't remember what makes you happy , imagine figuring it out and starting the seeds of a new life			1
( again , this advice does n't apply if you are facing threats to your safety			2
) wait to make big decisions			0
if you 're not facing financial ruin or the threat of violence , wait at least a few months for the pain and anxiety to settle down			0
in the fog of pain , people make rash decisions			0
one of @entity35 's friends was so unhappy in her life that she decided she had to get out of her marriage			1
she did n't realize she did n't really want out until she was gone			2
you need to figure out what you want			0
focus on the present moment			0
when the crazy thoughts are going through your head about who did what to who , and why did n't you say that perfect comeback line , @entity103 suggests taking out a piece of paper and writing down five things that you notice are actually happening around you			2
they 're usually pretty ordinary -- cars driving by , the dog barking , a child playing with dolls			0
go a little deeper and notice three things a little more carefully			0
that list , part of a group of exercises in her book , is n't ever as crazy as what 's in your head			1
it can have a calming effect			0
take charge of your own joy			0
@entity35 did n't simply plan a summer of fun for her family			1
she thought deliberately about what she could do to make herself and her two children happy during their financially strapped summer in their @entity139 town			0
it was often as simple as taking three deep breaths or walking down the block			0
sometimes she walked to a beautiful place or visited friends who helped keep the focus on herself , instead of trashing the husband			2
she turned on the sprinklers and watched her kids get soaked			0
she bought many tomatoes and canned tomato sauce			0
" do something that is positive and nurturing to you , " she says			0
give up on the dream			0
many people create a storyline or myth for their lives that says they will be powerful when they are pretty or handsome , skinny , married , a parent , or have the " right " job or salary			0
" if you 're only powerful when it goes a certain way , then what happens when you lose your job ? " asks @entity35			1
do you not matter anymore ? figure out the myths you tell yourself about your definition of success before you can move on			0
take some quiet time in prayer or meditation to get through other people 's voices , and what the culture says about what your life should be like , to your essential truth			0
" the advice for anyone going through a trauma is to allow the sorrow and vision for what you thought life should be to dissolve and see what 's left , " says @entity76			0
" you have all the knowledge you need to solve your problems inside of you			0
" choose your own feelings			2
it 's incredibly hard to do , but @entity35 says it 's essential			1
after all , we only truly believe other people 's mean comments about ourselves when we think they 're true -- that we 're unlovable or fat or nagging or mean - spirited			2
" what if someone told you when you were 12 that nobody can make you feel mad , make you cry just by what they say ? " she asks			0
" what if we had really understood that no one could make you feel emotionally anything ? " repeat after me : those barbs are not necessarily true			1
do not play the victim			0
you are only a victim in an emotional crisis if you choose to be			1
" when we get into reaction and escalating the drama , it only hurts us , " says @entity35			1
" there is a time and place for anger , but i want to powerfully choose those moments -- i do n't want to feel like they 're choosing me			1

@entity35 wrote a book on her own refusal to suffer when husband wanted *divorce*
she says do n't listen to or believe the mean barbs others will toss your way
*expert* : a crisis can push you toward a true calling and more happiness
