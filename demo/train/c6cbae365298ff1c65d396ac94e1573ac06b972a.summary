-- if you are pregnant , ask your doctor questions about their delivery habits long before you go into labor			0
several studies now suggest doctors may be performing too many cesarean sections			2
doctors may be performing them based more out of habit , training , expediency or worry about lawsuits than out of medical necessity , according to the studies			0
a surgical birth , while generally safe , does carry more health risks and more expense			1
if a woman has a c - section once , it also increases the chances she 'll need another if she gets pregnant again			1
risks go up with each procedure			2
the latest information comes from @entity26			2
the nonprofit ranked hospitals based on the number of c - sections performed at each			1
looking at hospital billing records the authors found the number of procedures performed vary wildly -- even at hospitals in the same town			1
in @entity42 , for instance , 15 % of births at @entity40 's @entity39 are c - sections ; four miles away , at @entity44 , the rate is more than double that at 37 %			1
the @entity46 earned @entity26 's highest rating for low rate of c - sections			1
doctors delivered 8 % of babies by c - section ; at @entity57 's @entity56 - @entity55 , by comparison , 20 % of the low - risk deliveries were c - sections			1
the report looked at more than 1,500 hospitals in 22 states			2
not all states make such information available -- something @entity26 said it hopes will change			2
overall , 66 % of the hospitals in the report earned the organization 's lowest or second - lowest rating for a high rate of c - sections			1
only 12 % got either of the organization 's top scores for a low rate			0
nation gets " c " for preterm birth rates " the variation is what gets you , that really is the thing , " said @entity76 , director of @entity26 ' @entity77			1
" if you compare peer hospitals in urban areas that treat the same kind of patients -- meaning they share similar socioeconomic issues -- to have wildly different rates suggests that there is a problem here			2
" sometimes c - sections are medically necessary , meaning either the life of the mother or her fetus would be endangered by a vaginal birth			1
but several studies found surgical births are being performed for low - risk pregnancies , too			2
c - sections are generally considered safe , compared with vaginal births , but the surgery carries risks , including infection , increased bleeding , reactions to anesthesia and blood clots , according to the @entity106			1
the rates vary regionally as well , according to the @entity108			1
more c - sections are performed in the @entity110 compared with the @entity111 , the @entity112 and the @entity113 , which tend to have the lowest rates			1
the @entity110 does have higher diabetes and obesity rates			2
both lead to more medically challenged deliveries , as does the mother 's age			0
the older she is , the more complications she may have			0
overall nearly one out of three women now give birth by c - section , according to the @entity108			1
that number has made medical associations uncomfortable			0
making note of other studies that look at regional variations in surgical birth rates , the @entity128 issued guidelines in march			2
these are intended to help doctors make more informed decisions about which mothers need c - sections			1
the high number of surgical births , plus the fact that fewer women or children die these days during the childbirth process , " raises significant concern that cesarean delivery is overused , " according to the recommendations			2
definition of " term " pregnancy changing dr. @entity150 , lead author of the report and recommendations , said he hopes these guidelines will raise awareness about this issue			0
" over the next five years , i would hope we will see a slow decline in the rate , " @entity150 said			0
but it " will be contingent on more people embracing the message and will have to involve people at the grass - roots level doing things in their practice that changes this trend			0
" the medical community started to see the number of c - sections going up during the 1970s when there was an increase in the ability to monitor the fetus ' heartbeat			1
" we did n't always know precisely how to interpret the data , " @entity150 said , adding at the time there was a " general abandonment of more aggressive vaginal deliveries			0
" the medical community still needs better research on fetal heart rates , he said			0
monitoring the heart rate can tell a doctor if a fetus is in distress			0
doctors also do c - sections if they believe labor is " going on too long , " according to the recommendations			1
however , that decision may be based on outdated research , according to @entity26 and other studies			2
the @entity128 do recommend that " normal " labor should be a longer process than initially thought , and concluded doctors " should be more patient in the first and second phase of labor			0
" doctors should not induce labor unless " it 's an absolute medical necessity , " according to the recommendations			0
encouraging a woman to give birth before her body is ready increases the likelihood she 'll need a surgical birth			0
doctors often perform c - sections if there is a possibility the baby will be large			1
the new guidelines said that may not always be warranted			0
a baby should be more than 11 pounds before inducing labor			0
" everyone can do better , " @entity150 said			0
@entity26 ' @entity212 agrees , saying that the women she talks to often do n't know the extra health risks of having a c - section			1
the best and worst place to give birth " we want to get a dialogue going , " @entity212 said			0
" we want the patient to go to her doctor and say , ' i 'd like for us to find ways to avoid a c - section if possible			1
' find a doctor that meets your needs in all practice patterns			0
" most doctors likely will not know the number of c - sections they perform , @entity150 said			2
even if a doctor does know it , the rate of the surgical deliveries they perform still may not give patients the perspective they would need			0
a doctor doing general rounds , for instance , could have to finish up a procedure another doctor started			0
or a doctor could be seeing a disproportionately older , heavier and sicker population , which would affect his or her rates of c - sections			1
@entity150 suggests women ask doctors about their general philosophy on c - sections			1
" i think a healthy dialogue is always important for any kind of medical care , " he said .			0

c - section rates vary wildly among hospitals , @entity26 finds
nearly one out of three women gives birth by c - section , the @entity108 says
c - sections carry higher health risks and expenses
