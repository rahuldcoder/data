walking through the 400 - acre @entity1 on the outskirts of @entity3 can be a curious experience			1
two perfectly geometric hills rise from the pancake - flat landscape , trees planted in rows form a circular copse , while a glass and steel pyramid looms nearby and three huge stainless steel columns point out of the ground like the antenna of a giant subterranean satellite dish			0
seen from above the layout is less recognizable as a park and more akin to the ancient line drawings in the @entity22 @entity21 desert			0
and all this built on top of a former sewage works			0
as far as municipal parks go , it might be one of the world 's most understated yet intriguing -- a fusion of classic @entity32 principles of quiet , natural beauty with 20th - century modernist art. it was the final act of @entity32 - @entity37 sculptor @entity36 whose career spanned seven decades -- much of it spent fusing art , architecture and public spaces			1
but @entity36 did not live to see the park built			2
more than sculpture @entity36 drew up plans for the park in november 1988 , but died , aged 84 , just one month later			2
it then took 17 years to complete his final project			1
" it was thrilling to finally see all the ideas that had n't been realized during his life , " says @entity50 , curator of the @entity51 in @entity52 , who was at the park 's opening ceremony in 2005			0
some of the concepts used in the park go back to some of @entity36 's ideas from the 1930s			1
@entity36 's training with celebrated @entity67 sculptor @entity66 in the 1920s helped fix his desire to be a sculptor , but it was n't until the 1940s that he found critical acclaim and larger commissions			1
far from being solely an abstract sculptor , @entity36 designed playgrounds and gardens , turned his hand to industrial design ( creating what 's now regarded as a classic table top and lamp ) and even designed sets and costumes for celebrated 20th - century dancer and choreographer @entity86			1
" this was very much at a time when the canon was either you 're a painter or you 're a sculptor and only that			0
he very much wanted to prove that wrong , " says @entity50			0
as well as moving across media he straddled two cultures			0
with an @entity96 - @entity37 mother and @entity32 father , he spent much of his life promoting artist exchange between the two countries , often at times when relations between them were tense or downright hostile			1
@entity105 disruptions when @entity32 - @entity37 were sent to internment camps in the @entity37 during the @entity107 , he volunteered to live in one in @entity108			1
showing solidarity with those forcibly moved there , he tried to design camp equipment to make them better places to live			2
however it proved easier getting in than out , and after seven months he moved back to @entity52			0
after the war he was one of the first @entity37 artists to visit and engage with @entity32 architects and artists , which led to an invitation to design the railings for the @entity123 in @entity124 in 1951			2
later he went on to collaborate with @entity125 , the architect who left a huge impression on the skylines of @entity32 cities in the 1960s and 70s			0
' i do not hide ' like other planned @entity32 gardens , @entity1 changes with the seasons			2
in winter it 's buried under deep @entity135 snow , where skiers hurtle down 62 - meter - tall @entity137 or ski cross-country throughout the grounds			0
cherry trees blossom in spring and in summer the whitewashed concrete " music shell " provide a stage for concerts and organized events			0
another example of @entity36 's emphasis on fusing the natural world with the manufactured lies inside the pyramid with a summertime cooling system that uses snow stored underground during the winter months			1
on his respect for nature and his own modern ethos @entity36 said : " the art of stone in a @entity32 garden is that of placement			1
its ideal does not deviate from that of nature ... but i am also a sculptor of the @entity162			0
i place my mark and do not hide			0
" despite his work appearing in 17 cities across the @entity37 and around the world , @entity50 believes @entity36 is appreciated more in @entity32 than in the @entity37 , citing hundreds of thousands of visitors to an exhibition of his work just 10 years ago in @entity170			1
" i think in @entity32 he 's seen much more as a hero , " she says			2
