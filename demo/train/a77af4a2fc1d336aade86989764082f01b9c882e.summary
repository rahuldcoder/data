-- the candidate who will face @entity3 president @entity2 in a runoff election next month has said he will not join @entity2 's government if the incumbent wins another term , but instead will remain in opposition			1
@entity9 , who served as foreign minister in @entity2 's government until quitting nearly four years ago , said he would congratulate @entity2 if he " is elected through a transparent and credible process			1
" " my trust in becoming a candidate was not to be part of the same government , part of the same deteriorating situation , " told @entity0 's @entity12 in an interview taped for broadcast on sunday 's " @entity15			1
" " @entity21 was for a change in this country			0
@entity21 was for bringing hopes for the people of this country , and making the people of @entity3 true participants in their politics , in the governance , in the developmental process , in the security situation and as a whole			0
" @entity9 and others charged massive fraud in the august 20 vote			1
the initial results gave @entity2 the win , but a subsequent review by a @entity41 - backed panel of election monitors threw out nearly one - third of @entity2 's votes because of " clear and convincing evidence of fraud			1
" the result left @entity2 short of the 50 percent need to avoid a runoff			1
after a flurry of meetings with @entity54 and @entity41 officials , the @entity3 president agreed to the november 7 vote			1
in a separate @entity0 interview to be broadcast sunday on " @entity57 , " @entity2 insisted that while there were " mistakes " and " some incidents of fraud " in the election , " the election as a whole was clean			1
" @entity9 rejected that notion			1
" to call this as clean elections , i think this , with all due respect to mr. @entity2 , it 's a bit of ignorance , " he told @entity12 , adding that " unfortunately , the government was involved			1
" " yes , it was a step forward that the people of @entity3 participated in the elections , " he said			0
" one chapter is behind us , " he said			0
" it led to the runoff			2
and we need to get it corrected in order to open the door for the new chapter			0
so denying it is not a solution			0
rather admitting it and correcting it , that will be responsible leadership			0
" @entity2 said the second round of voting must take place or else " we would be insulting democracy			1
" but he also said he had decided after agreeing to the runoff that " all that was said ( about fraud in the election ) was mostly wrong			1
" " there were some mistakes			0
there were some instances of fraud , but the nation as a whole was clean and the result was clear			2
i decided for peace , for stability and for the future of democracy in @entity3 and for the future of institutional order in @entity3 to call for a runoff , " he said			2
the @entity117 called for a boycott saturday of @entity3 's upcoming presidential run - off election and repeated threats to disrupt the vote			2
" the @entity123 is once again warning all the compatriots to not participate in that @entity54 fraud process , and like the first round , they have to listen to their consciences , " said a @entity117 statement			2
it said the @entity117 is ready to " collapse " the electoral process and any participant who gets hurt will only have themselves to blame			0
meanwhile , in @entity135 , @entity54 president @entity133 's special representative to @entity134 and @entity3 , @entity132 , said that the election process had worked as it was supposed to			2
" from the beginning ... i said publicly that this election would be imperfect , " @entity132 said			0
" i said it on the record			0
and there were many irregularities			0
but in the end , the process worked , and i want to stress that			0
the @entity146 declared that neither candidate got 50 percent , although one came very close , and that the top two candidates were president @entity2 and dr. @entity9 and they should have a runoff			1
" @entity132 added that it was " reasonable to hope " for fewer irregularities in a runoff			2
