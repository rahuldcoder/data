past , present and future came together on a thunderstorm - filled sunday , as president @entity2 received an honorary doctorate and gave the commencement speech at historically black , all - male @entity5 , where the rev. @entity6 and many other prominent african - americans spent their formative years			1
after opening with several one - liners , and more smiles than we 've seen from him in the damage - control - filled recent weeks , @entity2 delivered a serious message to the class of 2013			1
during a speech rife with both personal and historical references , the president invoked a past full of challenges , often resulting from racism , but noted that african - americans need to break free from that past to succeed in a globally competitive economy			1
" i understand that there 's a common fraternity creed here at @entity5 : ' excuses are tools of the incompetent , used to build bridges to nowhere and monuments of nothingness , ' " @entity2 said			1
" we 've got no time for excuses -- not because the bitter legacies of slavery and segregation have vanished entirely ; they have not			1
not because racism and discrimination no longer exist ; we know those are still out there			2
it 's just that in today 's hyperconnected , hypercompetitive world , with millions of young people from @entity44 and @entity45 and @entity46 -- many of whom started with a whole lot less than all of you did -- all of them entering the global workforce alongside you , nobody is going to give you anything that you have not earned , " he said			2
opinion : what @entity2 must say to @entity60 - @entity59 grads " nobody cares how tough your upbringing was			1
nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination			2
and moreover , you have to remember that whatever you 've gone through , it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured -- and they overcame them			2
and if they overcame them , you can overcome them , too , " he said			2
@entity5 valedictorian @entity76 praised @entity2 for setting a strong example			1
" there is no impossible			2
there is no unachievable , if you have the audacity to hope , " @entity76 said , paraphrasing the name of the president 's 2006 book , " @entity85			1
" following @entity76 -- whom @entity2 jokingly called " a skinny guy with a funny name " -- @entity2 reflected on how being an @entity60 has affected his personal journey			1
" whatever success i have achieved , whatever positions of leadership i 've held , have depended less on @entity94 degrees or sat scores or @entity96 , and have instead been due to that sense of connection and empathy , the special obligation i felt , as a black man like you , to help those who need it most ; people who did n't have the opportunities that i had -- because there , but for the grace of @entity109 , go i. i might have been in their shoes			1
i might have been in prison			0
i might have been unemployed			0
i might not have been able to support a family			0
and that motivates me , " the president said			1
big - name college commencement speakers of 2013 the president 's repeated mention of connection to the black community comes after blunt criticism from @entity5 alumnus @entity122 , a pastor from @entity123 , who criticized @entity2 in an april 14 editorial in the @entity125 , calling him " a president for everyone , except black people			1
" @entity122 gave a baccalaureate sermon on saturday as part of @entity5 's graduation weekend			1
the president 's speech on sunday was well - received , though the crowd had to brave some thunder and lightning and endure pouring rain			1
one awkward silence came when @entity2 slightly deviated from his prepared remarks			1
he was expected to say , " be the best husband to your wife , or boyfriend to your partner			0
" however , instead , he said " be the best husband to your wife , or your boyfriend , or your partner , " eliciting some clearly confused responses from the crowd			0
later , he noted that @entity5 men can set examples for other groups that have been subjected to discrimination : hispanics , gays and lesbians , @entity157 , and women			0
" it is not just the @entity60 - @entity59 community that needs you			1
as @entity5 men , many of you know what it 's like to be an outsider ; know what it 's like to be marginalized ; know what it 's like to feel the sting of discrimination			0
and that 's an experience that a lot of @entity59 share , " he said			0
@entity2 said his job , as president , is to advocate for policies that generate more opportunity for everyone , and he implored the @entity5 grads -- and all @entity59 -- to " advocate for an @entity59 where everyone has a fair shot in life			1
" " there are some things , as black men , we can only do for ourselves			2
there are some things , as @entity5 men , that you are obliged to do for those still left behind			0
as graduates -- as @entity5 men -- you now wield something even more powerful than the diploma you are about to collect			0
and that 's the power of your example , " he said			0
students scarred by war earn college degrees @entity2 finished his speech with another message not just to the newly minted @entity5 grads , but to all @entity59 -- a message based on @entity6 's refusal to be afraid			1
" that 's what being an @entity59 is all about			0
success may not come quickly or easily			2
but if you strive to do what 's right ; if you work harder and dream bigger ; if you set an example in your own lives and do your part to help meet the challenges of our times , then i am confident that , together , we will continue the never - ending task of perfecting our union , " he said			2
and despite lots of big - picture talk about success and giving back , @entity2 made it clear that without appropriate focus on those closest to you , big - picture accomplishments mean little			1
" everything else is unfulfilled if we fail at family -- if we fail at that responsibility			0
i know that when i am on my deathbed someday , i will not be thinking about any particular legislation i passed			0
i will not be thinking about a policy i promoted			0
i will not be thinking about the speech i gave			2
i will not be speaking about the @entity238 i received			0
i will be thinking about that walk i took with my daughters			0
i 'll be thinking about a lazy afternoon with my wife			0
i 'll be thinking about sitting around the dinner table , and seeing them happy and healthy and knowing they were loved			0
and i 'll be thinking about whether i did right by all of them			0
