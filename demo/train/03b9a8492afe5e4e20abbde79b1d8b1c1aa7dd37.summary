-- the first of twin research spacecraft entered the moon 's orbit saturday , part of an effort to learn more about how it and other terrestrial bodies formed , @entity1 said			1
the @entity10 -- which launched from @entity12 's @entity11 on september 10 , along with its sister spacecraft @entity10 -- began a " lunar orbit insertion burn " at about 4:30 p.m. et , @entity1 said on an associated @entity16 feed			1
that burn was set to finish around 5 p.m. the second in the pair , @entity10 , will follow suit sunday			2
" burn complete ! # grail - a is now orbiting the moon and awaiting the arrival of its twin @entity24 on @entity26 , " @entity1 's @entity21 announced on @entity16			1
the two orbiters , each 3 1/2 feet high and 2 1/2 feet deep , are named for @entity1 's @entity10			1
they will fly in tandem orbits , measuring the gravity field and ideally answering " longstanding questions about the moon and ( giving ) scientists a better understanding of how @entity35 and other rocky planets in the solar system formed , " according to @entity1			1
the moon is about 250,000 miles from @entity35 , a distance that @entity1 's @entity41 crews reached in about three days			1
but the grail spacecrafts took much longer , namely 3Â½ months , because they covered more than 2.5 million miles " reshaping and merging their orbits " so that they could be better positioned and coordinated to study the moon , @entity1 said			1
the orbiters , whose mission was timed to miss lunar eclipses in december and june , are expected to collect data for 82 days			1
@entity51 , principal investigator for @entity10 , said the moon remains mysterious in many ways and little is known about the process of how it was formed			1
scientists theorize that the moon formed when a @entity59 - sized object crashed into @entity35			2
it remains unknown why the near side of the moon is so different from the far side			0
the basins are flooded with volcanic material on one side , and the other side has mountainous highlands			0
why did these sides evolve differently ? " we think the answer is locked in the interior , " @entity51 said at a @entity1 news briefing wednesday			0
a study published in the journal nature over the summer suggested that there may have been a second moon moving at about the same speed as our moon , and in the same orbit			0
the second moon bumped into the original moon , the theory goes , and caused the formation of a mountain instead of a crater			0
this model predicts the whole exterior of the moon was once molten and cooled from the outside in such a way that when the second moon hit our moon , it pushed all of that molten material to the near side			0
@entity10 can help test this hypothesis			0
the spacecraft are designed to help scientists explore the interior of the moon indirectly by measuring the pull of gravity as they fly over the surface			1
with data about these changes in gravity and topography , scientists will be able to construct a map of what 's inside our celestial neighbor			2
scientists wanted the spacecraft to be as small as possible so they could launch in one rocket			0
but they were n't sure if the orbiters would make it through eclipses that happen at the moon every six months , since their technology depends on lithium - ion batteries and solar panels			0
a lunar eclipse occurred in early december , and the next one is in june			0
based on the current performance , scientists think @entity10 can continue through the june eclipse			2
should one of the orbiters completely fail , scientists could not get the high precision they would get from the two spacecraft ; the mission depends on having both , @entity51 said			2
if the lunar orbit insertion does n't happen for one of the spacecraft , there would be another opportunity to try again in late april .			0

new : one of two @entity1 research spacecraft begins orbiting the moon
new : grail - a and @entity10 will collect data for 82 days
the mission will help scientists determine what goes on *beneath* the moon 's surface
