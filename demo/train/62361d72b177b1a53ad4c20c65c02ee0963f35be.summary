-- @entity1 demolished the notion that @entity3 , which tends to vote @entity4 in presidential elections , is a bastion of the brand of progressive politics embodied by @entity10 's sometime - rival , the high - profile mayor of @entity12 , @entity13			1
@entity10 , @entity12 's governor , won re-election with 53 % of the vote on the same day gubernatorial candidates were getting trounced in @entity4 strongholds , including @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , which is a solid victory he can brag about			1
in fact , his victory sets the stage for what @entity10 's aides have quietly hinted could be the prelude to a run for president			0
but at the same time , @entity12 @entity31 flexed political muscles -- and @entity4 engaged in destructive infighting -- in a way that suggests the @entity35 , which might seem solid @entity4 blue on the outside , has deep streaks of @entity31 red on the inside			2
even as @entity10 and his @entity4 ticket mates for lieutenant governor , attorney general and state comptroller were racking up wins , the @entity31 flipped three congressional seats from @entity4 to @entity31 -- nearly a quarter of the estimated 14 to 18 seats @entity31 added to their @entity49 majority nationwide -- and unexpectedly came so close to ousting rep. @entity50 , a 14 - term @entity51 , that the race remains too close to call			1
equally important , republicans deposed enough state legislators to take firm control of the @entity56			0
that will make it hard , if not impossible , for @entity13 to win an increase in the minimum wage , college scholarships for undocumented immigrants , legal limits on rent increases , equal - pay legislation and other state - controlled policies loudly championed by the @entity12 mayor and his allies among labor leaders and community activists			1
@entity10 , a centrist in many respects , shows no signs of objecting to this state of affairs			0
although the governor pushed through @entity12 's same - sex marriage law and a tough gun - control measure , he remains a fiscal conservative dedicated to tax cuts and limited government spending			2
that has n't sat well with progressives , such as @entity13 's allies			0
earlier this year , @entity10 fended off a challenge from the left wing of the @entity4 when an upstart law professor , @entity87 , came from nowhere to win 30 of @entity12 's 62 counties			1
@entity10 ignored @entity89 , going to sometimes comical lengths to avoid debating her , speaking her name or shaking her hand			0
the governor also went on to publicly disparage and weaken the influence of the @entity95 , the political organization that recruited @entity89			0
and in a masterpiece of political payback , @entity10 created a new ballot line , the @entity99 , that siphoned off votes from the @entity95 group and clearly gave @entity31 a chance to take advantage of @entity4 infighting			2
" @entity10 promised to take back the @entity105			2
instead , he squandered millions on a fake party , and left millions more in his campaign account as @entity12 @entity4 in the legislature and in @entity112 withered on the vine , " said @entity106 , the executive director of @entity95 , in a blistering statement hours after election results became clear			0
@entity10 will now face a tough legislative session , with angry liberals clamoring for an agenda that the @entity31 - dominated state @entity56 will likely stall or block altogether			1
@entity10 will also be pressed by progressives who believe that @entity13 's management of @entity12 represents a national turning point			1
in an article titled " the @entity126 @entity13 , " one of the mayor 's labor allies claimed that @entity12 progressive politics were in tune with the spirit of the age ( the zeitgeist ) , and that " shifting demographics and the social liberalism of young people portend a long period of @entity4 dominance in national politics			1
" the midterm elections results suggest that judgment may be premature			0
as @entity10 , the victorious centrist , has been saying all along .			0

@entity143 : election *upended* idea @entity12 is bastion of @entity13 - like progressive politics
@entity10 , @entity51 with presidential sights , re-elected , but @entity31 took 3 @entity49 seats
he says @entity31 *tightened* grip on @entity105 ; progressive initiatives will have trouble
