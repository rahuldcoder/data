-- if voters in the @entity3 were offered the chance tomorrow , in a snap referendum , to change the name of the nation to " @entity8 " the result would hardly be in doubt			2
such is the mood of euphoria fostered by the country 's gold medal - winning performers , and @entity16 's successful staging of an @entity17 that some had predicted would become the latest in a long tradition of great @entity3 cockups , that a country more used to wallowing in sporting failure is waking up to the unfamiliar feeling of giving itself a collective pat on the back			1
a little more than two weeks ago , @entity16 was a city pregnant with angst , the final preparations dogged by a security scandal that required 18,000 military personnel -- almost double the number of @entity3 troops currently deployed in @entity31 -- to be drafted in to guard venues , fears of transport meltdown and lingering arguments over spiralling costs and an uncertain legacy			1
now all of that has largely been pushed aside			2
even self - styled sporting skeptics have been forced to abandon all pretense of curmudgeonliness as the nation basks in a self - congratulatory golden glow			2
" admittedly i 'm the guy who wrote that i 'd rather drink paint than have to sit in a stand and watch this stuff , but that was last week and the world has since changed , " wrote @entity46 , summing up the endorphin - fueled mood swing in the @entity49 newspaper			2
at a constellation of sites clustered around the @entity58 , @entity16 delivered a stellar spectacle that largely ran like clockwork			1
the showcase @entity62 proved an elegant setting as @entity64 cemented his claim to be the all - conquering , swaggering sporting icon of his generation by defending his 100 - and 200 - meter sprint titles , and @entity70 confirmed his status as the greatest olympian in history , adding four golds and two silvers to his total haul of 22 medals			2
elsewhere , beach volleyball , played out incongruously amid austere ministries of government and not a little sniggering from the stands , served up a novelty hit in a country where beaches are more associated with donkey rides than bikinis , while the city 's landmarks and parks offered telegenic backdrops and enthusiastic crowds whenever the games ventured onto the streets , culminating sunday in a men 's marathon bathed in sunshine			1
these were an open - minded and progressive games , in which a handful of women from @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 competed for the first time , and where the double amputee @entity105 , nicknamed @entity106 , bestrode the gap between @entity17 and @entity108 , by representing @entity109 on the track			2
yet the ultimate success and atmosphere of any major sporting event inevitably hangs on the fortunes of the hosts , and in this regard @entity3 competitors could hardly have delivered more			0
a tally of 29 gold medals and third place in the medals table represented @entity8 's best performance at an olympiad since 1908 , leaving the country 's traditional sporting antagonists such as @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 flailing in its wake			0
in cycling , @entity16 's homegrown hero @entity130 achieved cult status by riding to victory in the time trial just days after he had become the first @entity3 winner of the @entity136			1
in the velodrome , home riders raced to seven of the 10 gold medals on offer , prompting frenzied @entity128 speculation that the @entity3 had developed " magic wheels			0
" but it was a glorious saturday night in the main stadium that would be @entity8 's defining moment , as heptathlete @entity146 , long jumper @entity147 and 10,000 - meter runner @entity149 all won gold in quick succession			0
in the disparate backgrounds of the country 's champions , some saw further proof of the sort of self - confident , inclusive society that @entity159 had sought to capture in an opening ceremony widely acclaimed as " bonkers and eccentric " but dismissed as " multicultural crap " by one right - wing lawmaker			2
asked by a journalist whether he would prefer to be representing his country of birth , @entity167 , who left war - torn @entity169 for @entity16 when he was a young boy and who would subsequently also stride to gold in the 5,000 meters , seemed to sum it up : " look , mate , this is my country			1
this is where i grew up , this is where i started life			0
this is my country and when i put on my @entity183 vest , i 'm proud			1
" still , others also drew quiet inspiration from the performance of the flame - haired and freckled @entity147			0
" seeing a ginger in the @entity17 # hope , " one teenager posted on @entity189			0
even some of the @entity17 ' gaffes would prove triumphant vignettes			0
if all that was missing from the faux - green and pleasant land of @entity159 's tone - setting re-imagining of @entity3 history was a village idiot , the @entity194 soon found a ready - made one in the bumbling figure of @entity202			0
photographed stranded on a zipwire high over east @entity16 , wearing an unflattering blue safety helmet and clutching a pair of @entity208 flags , @entity16 's maverick mayor proved himself immune to politics ' normal gravitational laws , returning to @entity211 to dodge questions about whether his " good @entity17 " had fueled prime ministerial ambitions			1
" how could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck on a zip wire ? " was @entity202 's knowingly self - deprecating reply			0
for a city of @entity16 's stature and international reputation , it might have surprised some observers that pessimists and doomsayers had been so confidently vocal in the buildup to the games			1
but @entity3 administrators had previous history of delivering dismally on grand projects , from the debacle of the unloved @entity233 -- re-purposed for the games as a basketball and gymnastics arena -- to the lengthy , budget - busting delays in rebuilding the @entity239 football stadium , and the scrapping of plans to host the 2005 world athletics championships			1
even @entity244 's rain - soaked @entity243 in june , endured with stiff upper lip stoicism by monarch and monarchists alike , appeared to offer a foretaste of grim gray skies and the embarrassing spectacle of a once mighty imperial power in perpetual decline			0
more seriously , preparations for the games were inextricably linked to the 2005 @entity16 bombings that killed 52 people just one day after the city had celebrated winning hosting rights			1
nagging fears of a further atrocity would justify a heavy - handed security operation that included the deployment of warships in the @entity264 , rocket batteries on rooftops and a no - fly zone in the skies overhead , and the confiscation of family picnics at the entry to @entity17 sites			2
ultimately though , the games can be judged to have delivered a cathartic and regenerative moment for a city which just one year ago found itself under scrutiny for the wrong reasons amid the worst urban unrest in decades			1
if the face of @entity16 then was of a hooded looter clutching a stolen television , now the legions of purple - shirted volunteers , widely hailed as the heart and soul of the games , have become ambassadors for a society seemingly more at ease with itself in all its colors and contradictions			1
whether that spirit of goodwill can be kept alive when the afterglow has faded and @entity3 wake up to headlines about their worsening economic problems and a coalition government in deepening disarray remains to be seen			0
the wider @entity3 , which mostly seemed to put regional rivalries and @entity16 - bashing aside for the duration of the games , still faces the existential threat posed by the 2014 referendum on @entity305 independence , though the sight of gold medal - winning @entity305 such as @entity308 and @entity309 posing with @entity208 flags will have done no favours to the nationalist cause north of the @entity314 border			1
attempting to make snap historical sense of seemingly seismic shifts in national mood is also a notoriously fickle business , and in the @entity3 in particular there should be a wariness of getting caught up too exuberantly in the moment			0
the collective outpouring of grief that followed the death of princess @entity325 in 1997 is now looked back on by many with bemusement , as is the brief " @entity336 " moment of the mid- 1990s , dubbed " @entity335 " by @entity330 magazine , which soon lost its lustre , exposed as a feeble parody of @entity3 music 's 60s heyday			0
other countries to have experienced a similar bounce in fortunes on the back of sporting triumph have also struggled to cling to the moment			0
@entity128 's celebrated victory on home soil at the @entity345 , achieved by a team of black , white and @entity348 footballers , was widely hailed as a watershed moment for multiculturalism there , but few were still talking so complacently about social integration by the time the banlieues exploded into rioting in 2005			1
@entity16 's organizers , keen to distance themselves from the awesome projection of @entity359 's growing power put on by @entity360 in 2008 , were always modest about their expectations , choosing to draw instead on the spirit of the city 's post-war " @entity363 " in 1948 by pledging to host an event humbler in scale than its predecessor but warmer in tone			1
but , above and beyond that , the city triumphed in putting on a show rich in human spirit at its most optimistic that will shine with luminosity in the collective memory long after the extinguishing of the flame .			0

@entity183 widely hailed for its staging of 2012 games , says @entity381
@entity381 : all previous doubts over security and cost were *brushed* aside
2012 saw great achievements by male and *female* athletes
olympics have *revitalized* @entity16 , one year after riots , @entity381 argues
