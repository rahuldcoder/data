-- @entity2 's life reads like a boy 's own adventure tale with a modern eco-twist			2
@entity2 was the first man to walk to both the @entity6			1
inspired by the daring age of @entity9 exploration , @entity2 followed in the footsteps of his heroes ; the men who risked , and lost , their lives to reach the @entity14			1
at the age of 29 he embarked on an expedition to the @entity14 that was unsupported -- a trek that required him to pull his own sleigh and that lacked medical support crews			0
by the time he was 33 he had become the first man to walk to both the @entity23 poles unsupported			0
but for @entity2 , the epic journeys to the @entity25 , and the sailing and overland adventures that have followed , unearthed more than just a spirit for adventure			1
he experienced firsthand the impact of humanity on the environment when under the hole in the ozone layer at the @entity14 , the harsh ultraviolet rays from the sun burned his skin and permanently changed the color of his eyes			0
it firmed a desire to preserve the fragile natural world and to educate and inspire others , particularly the next generation of decision - makers to do the same			0
" as the last unspoiled wilderness on @entity47 , @entity9 is currently protected by the treaty prohibiting drilling and mining until 2041			0
decisions made by today 's youth will impact our entire planet 's ecosystem and the future of life on earth , " he says on 2041.com			0
his polar icewalks gained international attention and in 1992 he was asked to speak at the @entity63 @entity62 in @entity64 , later gaining an obe and being appointed @entity66 to the director general of @entity68 in recognition of his work			0
at the @entity62 in @entity64 he committed to a " global mission " to remove 1,500 tons of waste from @entity9			0
@entity2 and a team of young people from across the world were successful in cleaning up the @entity77 @entity9 base of @entity78 by 2000 , making it inhabitable for wildlife again			1
foresight , planning and determination then are not alien to a man who spent five years sourcing the funding for his first @entity9 expedition , and @entity2 's latest project is taking an even longer - term view			1
@entity2 founded his organization " 2041 " in 2003 in order to further his mission of action and education			2
named after the year in which @entity9 's protection against mineral exploitation ends , @entity2 regularly takes business people , teachers and students on expeditions to @entity9 to impress on those with the capacity to enact change that preservation of the environment is essential and achievable			1
continuing the green mission on the continent by minimizing the human footprint in the region , his international teams have helped design and build the world 's first education station in @entity9 that is run solely on renewable energy			2
add to the expeditions , ocean voyages on a boat with sails made from recycled plastic bottles , and it 's clear that the veteran polar explorer is a man who is doing all he can to protect and preserve the @entity9 .			1
