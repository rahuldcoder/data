@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration has dramatically ratcheted up the @entity5 drone warfare program in @entity6			1
since president @entity3 took office , @entity5 drone strikes have killed about a half - dozen militant leaders along with hundreds of other people , a quarter of whom were civilians			1
as a result of the unprecedented 42 strikes by drone aircraft into @entity6 authorized by the @entity3 administration , aimed at @entity18 and @entity19 networks based there , about a half - dozen leaders of militant organizations have been killed			1
the dead include two heads of @entity26 terrorist groups allied with @entity19 and @entity27 , the leader of the @entity6 @entity18 , in addition to hundreds of lower - level militants and civilians , according to our analysis			1
the number of civilian deaths caused by the drones is an important issue , because in the charged political atmosphere of today 's @entity6 , where @entity39 is rampant , the drone program is a particular cause of anger among those who see it as an infringement on @entity6 's sovereignty			1
a @entity47 poll in august found that only 9 percent of @entity6 favored the strikes , and two - thirds opposed them			2
and , according to @entity55 , a @entity56 human rights investigator , the use of drones to carry out targeted assassinations that end up killing civilians may well violate international law			0
on tuesday at a news conference in @entity59 , @entity55 publicly warned that unless the @entity3 administration explains what the legal basis is for selecting the individuals targeted by drone attacks , " it will increasingly be perceived as carrying out indiscriminate killings in violation of international law			1
" an important factor in the controversy over the drones , put forth by some commentators , is the widespread perception that they kill large numbers of @entity6 civilians			2
@entity76 , a leading @entity6 journalist , wrote in @entity77 in april that since january 2006 , @entity5 drone attacks had killed " 687 innocent @entity6 civilians			1
" a month later , a similar claim was made in the @entity81 by counterinsurgency experts @entity83 and @entity84 , who wrote that drone strikes had " killed some 700 civilians			2
this is 50 civilians for every militant killed , a hit rate of 2 percent			2
" in other words , in their analysis , 98 percent of those killed in drone attacks were civilians			1
@entity83 and @entity84 advocated a moratorium on the strikes because of the " public outrage " they arouse			0
a very different picture was presented this month by the @entity102 , an @entity5 blog that closely tracks terrorist groups , in particular @entity19 and the @entity18			2
@entity105 , the editor of @entity102 , concluded that according to his close analysis of the drone strikes , only 10 percent of those killed were civilians			2
our analysis suggests quite different conclusions than those of either @entity83 and @entity84 or the @entity102			0
but first , a word on our methodology			0
our analysis of the drone campaign is based only on accounts from reliable media organizations with substantial reporting capabilities in @entity6			2
we restricted our analysis to reports in the @entity81 , @entity122 and @entity123 ; accounts by major news services and networks -- the @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity1 and the @entity129 -- and reports in the leading @entity132 - language newspapers in @entity6 -- the @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity77 -- as well as those from @entity136 , the largest independent @entity6 television network			0
( links to all those individual reports can be found here			0
) the news organizations we relied upon collectively for our data cover the drone strikes as accurately and aggressively as possible			0
and though we do n't pretend that our study is accurate down to the last civilian death in every drone strike , we posit that our research has generated some quite reliable data on the number of militant leaders killed , a fairly good estimate of the number of lower - level militants killed and a reliable sense of the real civilian death rate			2
since 2006 , our analysis indicates , 83 @entity5 drone attacks in @entity6 have killed between 760 and 1,050 people			1
among them were about 20 leaders of @entity19 , the @entity18 and allied groups , all of whom have been killed since january 2008			0
it is not possible to differentiate precisely between militant and civilian casualties , because the militants live among the population and do n't wear uniforms and because the militants have the incentive to claim that all the casualties were civilians , but government sources tend to claim the opposite			0
however , of those killed in drone attacks from 2006 through mid-october 2009 , approximately 500 to 720 were described in reliable press reports as militants , or roughly two - thirds of the total killed			1
based on our count of the estimated number of militants killed , the real total of civilian deaths since 2006 appears to be in the range of 260 to 320 , or one - third of those killed			0
that finding tracks with polling by the @entity189 , described by @entity77 of @entity6 as " a think tank of researchers and political activists " that works in the @entity6 tribal region along the @entity195 border , where the drone attacks have consistently taken place			1
it found that more than half the people surveyed in winter 2008 in this region , known as the @entity201 , said the drone strikes were accurate and were damaging the militant organizations based there			0
under president @entity3 , the strikes have taken out at most half a dozen militant leaders while killing approximately 450 other people			1
of those , about 75 percent are reported to have been lower - level militants , and about a quarter appear to have been civilians			2
the strikes appear to have killed a slightly lower percentage of civilians in the past nine months than during the earlier years of the @entity5 drone campaign in @entity6			1
@entity3 , far from curtailing the drone program he inherited from president @entity217 , has dramatically increased the number of @entity219 and reaper drone strikes			1
there have been 44 strikes in @entity6 this year ( two while @entity217 was still in office ) , compared with 34 in all of 2008			0
none of the strikes under either @entity217 or @entity3 has targeted @entity226 , who seems to have vanished like a wraith			0
the leader of the @entity6 @entity18 , @entity27 , the mastermind of @entity230 's december 2007 assassination and many of the suicide bombings in @entity195 , was a frequent target of the drone attacks			1
under @entity3 , according to our analysis , 15 drone strikes specifically targeted @entity27			2
but he still did n't see it coming			0
on august 5 , @entity27 , a diabetic former gym instructor , was receiving a leg massage on the roof of a house in @entity242 when a missile from a drone slammed into his hideout , killing one of his wives , her father and the terrorist chief himself			0
the @entity6 press was jubilant			0
" @entity253 , @entity254 " was the lead headline in the quality @entity134			0
much of the previous coverage in @entity6 of @entity5 drone strikes in the tribal region had ranged from critical to downright hostile			1
but in the case of @entity27 , @entity5 strategic interests and @entity6 interests were closely aligned because the @entity6 @entity18 's victims included not only @entity230 , the country 's most popular politician , but hundreds of @entity6 policemen , soldiers and civilians			1
as the drone attacks have put @entity19 and allied groups under increased pressure , law enforcement authorities have uncovered few serious plots against @entity5 or @entity274 targets that are traceable back to militants who had trained in @entity6 's tribal regions since summer 2008 , when the drone program was first expanded			1
a major exception is @entity279 , a onetime coffee - cart operator on @entity281 who later worked as a shuttle van driver at the @entity284 , @entity285 , airport			0
authorities say @entity279 , an @entity195 immigrant , was planning to launch this fall what could have been the deadliest terrorist attack in the @entity5 since september 11			0
he had traveled in late august 2008 to @entity6 , where by his own admission he was trained in explosives by @entity19 members in a tribal area along the @entity195 border			0
the @entity295 found pages of handwritten notes on @entity279 's laptop computer about the manufacture and initiation of explosives and the components of various detonators and fusing systems , technical know - how he had picked up at one of @entity19 's training facilities between late summer 2008 and january 2009 , a period of intensified drone attacks			1
drone strikes are an important tool to disrupt @entity19 and @entity18 operations and to kill the leaders of these organizations , but they also consistently kill @entity6 civilians , angering the population and prompting violent acts of revenge from the @entity6 @entity18			1
for the time being , however , they appear to be the least bad option the @entity5 has for reducing the threat from @entity6 's militants , given that an @entity5 ground assault into @entity6 's tribal regions is out of the question and that @entity5 and @entity6 strategic interests are more closely aligned today than they have been in years because of the two countries ' shared interest in attacking the @entity6 @entity18 and their @entity19 allies			1
