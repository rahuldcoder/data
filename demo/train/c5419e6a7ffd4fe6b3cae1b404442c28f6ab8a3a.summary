-- it 's honeymooners ' heaven and a surfer 's dream			1
it 's @entity6 's most remote capital and perhaps its most exotic			1
home to hula skirts and palm trees and some of the world 's most breathtaking beaches , @entity7 may well be a @entity6 paradise			1
but paradise is n't cheap			2
the @entity15 capital and the surrounding island of @entity17 are among the most expensive places in the @entity6 , and it can feel intimidating to find reasonably priced meals and activities as a budget - conscious tourist			1
luckily , there are some monetary oases within this @entity6 paradise that will bring a smile to the heart ( and wallet ) of travelers on a budget			2
" @entity30 -- yes , it 's actually called @entity30 -- is @entity17 's public transportation system , and it has stops throughout the island			1
one - way fares for adults are $ 2.50 and $ 1.25 for kids			2
( you can also get a four - day pass for $ 25.00 and a monthly pass for $ 60.00 )			2
@entity30 is a great way to get around @entity17 without busting the piggy bank on a rental car			1
plus , because it 's the driver 's responsibility to worry about traffic , all tourists have to do is soak in the sights			1
to luau or not to luau ? your @entity50 tips taste @entity15 cuisine			2
no trip to @entity17 is complete without some native hawaiian fare like kalua pork ( smoked pork slow - cooked underground ) , lomi lomi salmon ( fresh tomato and salmon salad ) , chicken long rice ( chicken broth with glass noodles ) and poi ( mashed taro )			1
@entity67 's @entity66 -- winner of the @entity69 run by @entity50 's @entity70 -- offers a variety of native hawaiian dishes for under $ 10			1
the family - run restaurant has been in business since the 1950s , and the sisters who currently run it are happy to answer questions about dishes with an enthusiastic smile			0
@entity81 's @entity66 is a short 20 - minute bus ride from @entity83 on the 13 bus ; the restaurant is closed on mondays			1
to sample some of the best short ribs on the island , visit another family - run local favorite , @entity89 's @entity15 , which has been around since 1946 and was featured on the @entity91 's " @entity90			1
the b or 2 buses go to @entity89 's from @entity83 , and the ride takes about 40 minutes			1
it 's also closed on mondays			1
@entity50 : dos and don'ts climb @entity99			0
work off that @entity101 pig by climbing @entity99 crater			0
one of the most iconic sites on @entity17 , it was formed about 300,000 years ago after a volcanic eruption			1
the trail to the summit was built in 1908 and used by the military to defend @entity17 from invaders , but today , guests can climb it to see some of the most spectacular views of the island			1
trekkers should allow 1Â½ - 2 hours for the climb and should wear comfortable shoes			0
some parts of the ascent can be strenuous , and near the summit , there is a 225 - foot narrow tunnel ; those suffering from claustrophobia should ask for the alternate route to the top			0

@entity99 is also accessible via a short ride on the 22 , 23 and 24 buses from @entity83			0
cost of admission is $ 1.00 for pedestrians			0
pick up souvenirs at the @entity133			1
take the 20 or 42 bus from downtown @entity7 to the @entity135 where a huge swap meet -- kind of like a flea market -- takes place wednesdays , saturdays and sundays			1
here , everything from macadamia nuts to @entity15 shirts and local crafts to junk that residents are trying to unload from their attics are sold at prices well below what 's to be found in @entity83			1
while some selling their wares at the swap meet are regular vendors offering deals on beach towels or souvenir magnets , be sure to check out locals selling used items on blankets near their cars , which may be more unique			1
entrance to the swap meet is $ 1.00 , and the best time to arrive is between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning			0
do n't miss the opportunity to pay your respects to those who died at @entity159 on december 7 , 1941			0
the mood is a somber , peaceful contrast to the frenetic activity of @entity83 , and the museum offers a unique opportunity to learn about the @entity159 attack from personal accounts of people who were there			0
while there is a charge to tour some areas of @entity159 , many of the most moving parts of this historic site are free			0
there is no charge to visit the @entity181 in the @entity182 or to tour the @entity183			0
note : tours of the @entity183 must be reserved			0
to reserve online there is a $ 1.50 reservation fee per ticket			0
it is not uncommon for tours to be booked solid several days in advance , though some tickets may be available up until noon on the same day of the tour			0
the 20 , 40 , @entity195 , 42 and 62 buses from @entity83 all make stops at @entity159 ; the ride takes about an hour			0
no visit to @entity50 is complete without an afternoon shave ice			1
this @entity15 treat is somewhat like a snow cone , only with smaller ice slivers that hold syrup better			1
for a really authentic incarnation of this treat , ask for a splash of @entity209 powder on top -- a kind of sweet and sour topping made from dried plums -- or condensed milk			0
azuki beans ( sweet red beans ) and ice cream are also delicious accompaniments			1
while it 's sure to be delectable just about anywhere on the island , @entity219 in @entity220 is particularly yummy			2
expect to spend $ 4 to $ 6 , depending on size , for your sugary treat			0
cheer as surfer dudes conquer the @entity228			0
@entity17 is a surfer 's paradise and home to some of the most exhilarating -- and dangerous -- waves in the world			1
here , it 's not unusual to see daring surfers sliding underneath curling waves of the variety normally reserved for magazine covers and " @entity239			2
" surfers ride waves all day , though they 're usually most impressive before 11 a.m. located on the less developed north side of @entity17 , the @entity228 is near the @entity242 ( coming up next )			1
the 52 bus from @entity7 goes to the pipeline ; the ride takes a little over two hours			2
to get to @entity242 from the pipeline , take the 52 bus back toward @entity7 for approximately 15 minutes			2
get lost in awe at " lost " locations			0
most of the hit television series " @entity253 " was filmed on @entity17 and fans can visit everywhere from the mental institution where @entity256 lived to the home of the mysterious @entity258			1
many of these sites are free : for a quick infusion of " @entity253 " mystique , visit the @entity263 in downtown @entity7 to see where the cast filmed scenes that supposedly took place in the @entity267			0
for the quintessential " lost " experience , visit the site of the fictional @entity253 crash			0
@entity242 , the filming site for most of season one , is on the north shore of @entity17 , and a great place to visit along with the @entity228			1
the north side of @entity17 is less developed as a tourist destination than the south side where @entity83 is , so it 's not unusual for the beach to be empty ( though do n't be surprised to see a sea turtle napping on the shore )			1
beware that the intense surf on @entity17 's northern beaches often makes swimming dangerous , and no lifeguards are on duty			1
by bus , take the 52 to the @entity287 and transfer onto the 55			2
get off at the @entity289 stop on @entity290			0
make a left onto @entity289 and walk about five minutes to the public access point for the " lost " beach			2
it opened as a fruit stand in 1950 , but today , the @entity294 is a well - trodden tourist attraction that pays homage to one of the island 's most iconic foods : the pineapple			2

for a bit more of a splurge , the @entity309 is $ 5 for adults and $ 4.25 for children , and access to the world 's largest maze -- complete with a pineapple at its center -- is $ 6 for adults and $ 4 for children			2
a ride aboard the 20 - minute pineapple express train is a little steeper , costing $ 8 for adults and $ 6 for children			0

to get to the @entity294 , take bus 8 , 19 , 20 , 47 or 58 from @entity83 and transfer onto the 52 at @entity332 ; ride time is approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes			2
after a hard day of touring , a hearty meal is always needed			0
@entity338 , located right in @entity83 , is a @entity340 cafeteria - style restaurant known for its homemade udon noodles -- a kind of thick , chewy spaghetti -- and the line out the door			1
many of the noodle dishes cost under $ 5 and , for an extra splurge , individual pieces of tempura -- deep - fried shrimp or vegetables -- are available for about $ 1.50			0
( note : @entity338 does not take credit cards )			0
