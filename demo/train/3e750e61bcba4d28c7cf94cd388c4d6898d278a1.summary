" a senior government official , not authorized to speak on the record , provided @entity1 with the full list of 14 countries that fall under the @entity2 's " countries of interest " label -- which will automatically trigger the enhanced screening			1

the @entity25 compiles the annual " @entity59 " report , which details terrorism trends in countries around the world			2

" the @entity2 did not elaborate on what those enhanced security procedures might entail			1
the directive was issued to domestic and international air carriers			0
in addition , the directive also keeps in place a mandate -- issued after an attempted @entity90 terror attack on a @entity5 - bound flight -- giving pilots discretion to prevent passengers from keeping pillows and blankets on their laps during certain international flights , the official said			2
also retained is the option for pilots to limit movement in the cabin on those international flights			0
