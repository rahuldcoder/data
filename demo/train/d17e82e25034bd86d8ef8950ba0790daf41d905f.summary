@entity0 -- @entity2 only has good things to say about the @entity4 , where she served a total of 14 years before leaving in 2009			1
it 's the only profession she 's ever known			2
" i love the @entity4 , " she said during a recent interview in suburban @entity8			1
" if you split me open , i 'm blue and gold			2
" @entity2 , a former lieutenant and medical service corps officer , first enlisted right after college but by the time she left had earned two master 's degrees , deployed to @entity15 and racked up substantial experience in healthcare and administration -- experience she thought would impress potential civilian employers			1
i was an @entity21 manager			2
i was a logistics manager , " she said			2
but despite all that , @entity2 now is unemployed -- two years after leaving the military			1
a single mother with two teenage children , she lost her home to foreclosure in september and is currently living in transitional housing			1
" i 'm a female homeless vet with children , and i mean that , that 's horrible , that 's the worst , i think			1
you go from being self - supportive , having a great income to now serving your country , fighting for your country , and then you get out , and now i 'm homeless , all because i ca n't find a job			2
" @entity2 is not alone			1
in september , the unemployment rate for post- 9/11 veterans was 11.7 % , higher than the national average of 9.1 % , according to the @entity40			1
for female veterans in particular , the number is even worse -- 14.7 % last month			1
it 's not entirely clear why the picture appears worse for female vets			1
veterans advocates point to challenges like child care and dealing with a @entity50 system -- and a civilian world -- still relatively unaccustomed to dealing with female combat veterans			1
" a lot of people in this country do n't understand or appreciate that women are in combat , that women are even in the military in the scope that they are			2
so , 15 % of returning veterans are women , they are on the frontlines , they are getting shot at , they are leading tough missions , " @entity61 , executive director of @entity62 , said			1
" and they , too , need the same training and skills that their male counterparts do			2
" skills like how to create a resume			2
" i really did n't know how to do a resume			0
i never had to do one			0
so , that was a challenge , " @entity2 said			1
" also a challenge was taking all of my military experience and putting it in layman 's terms so a civilian employer could understand what i did			0
" @entity2 has since worked with professional resume writers , attended job fairs and sent out her resume dozens of times			1
but she 's gotten few call backs and only two interviews			0
one of them was at @entity94			0
she did n't get that job and surmises it 's because she was overqualified -- perhaps , but she needed a job			0
" there were not a lot of jobs , and jobs i was applying for i was actually overqualified for , which led of course to depression and all things that come along with , you know , being unemployed			1
it was difficult because when you live in a town that is not necessarily a military town , people do n't honor the fact that , yes , you were fighting for your country , and now here you are trying to fight for a job and fight to hold onto your house and all of that			0
" @entity2 said she left the @entity4 for health reasons , and while re-enlistment might be an option , she is not sure she would meet the enlistment requirements			1
in recent weeks , she has pursued a new tack : " i want to take the advice of one person , who said , ' apply up			0
do n't apply for administrative assistant when you should really be applying for director or project manager or supervisor			0
' " she remains hopeful			0
" my faith gets me through a lot			0
i truly believe that @entity131 does n't take anything away without bringing you something better			0
so , my faith keeps me going			0
and my children , they 're very positive and upbeat , but not only that , they 're very understanding			0
they know this is temporary			0
i know this is just temporary , i know something will turn around , soon			0
" but for sure , @entity2 is under pressure to find something soon			1
she and her kids must move out of their temporary housing in just two weeks , on november 11 -- @entity145			0
