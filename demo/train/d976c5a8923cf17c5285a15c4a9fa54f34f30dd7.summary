@entity1 , @entity0 -- a web site that encourages girls as young as seven to give virtual dolls breast implants and put them on crash diets has caused concern among parents and children 's activists			1
the provocatively named " @entity13 " web site launched in the @entity14 last month and is described as a " virtual fashion game for girls			1
" girls are encouraged to compete against each other to become the " hottest , coolest , most famous bimbo in the whole world			1
" when a girl signs up , they are given a naked virtual character to look after and pitted against other girls to earn " bimbo " dollars so they can dress her in sexy outfits and take her clubbing			1
sound off : what do you think about the " @entity13 " web site ? they are told " stop at nothing , " even " meds or plastic surgery , " to ensure their dolls win			1
users are given missions , including securing plastic surgery at the game 's clinic to give their dolls bigger breasts , and they have to keep her at her target weight with diet pills , which cost 100 bimbo dollars			2
breast implants sell at 11,500 bimbo dollars and net the buyer 2,000 bimbo attitudes , making her more popular on the site			1
and bagging a billionaire boyfriend is the most desirable way to earn the all important " mula " or bimbo dollars			2
@entity57 , it seems , is a bit of a chore in bimbo world			0
the site says : " @entity62 dollars is ' the cabbage , ' ' bread , ' the ' mula ' you 'll need to buy nice things and to get by in bimbo world			2
to earn some bimbo cash you will have to ( gasp ) work or find a boyfriend to be your sugar daddy and hook you up with a phat expense account ! " the advice on feeding the dolls is even more spurious , encouraging them to feed the dolls " every now and then " even though they want to keep their bimbos " waif thin			2
" the @entity14 version already has nearly 200,000 players , most of whom are girls aged between 7 and 17 , according to the web site			1
although it is free to play , when the contestants run out of virtual dollars they have to send cell phone text messages costing $ 3 each or use @entity89 to top up their accounts			0
in @entity92 , where " @entity13 's " sister web site , " @entity13 , " was criticized by dieticians and parents when it began last year , one parent threatened the creators with legal action after his daughter ran up a $ 200 mobile bill sending texts without his knowledge , according to the @entity103 newspaper			1
parents ' groups are horrified that the game is taking off in @entity14 , fearing it could send the wrong message about eating disorders and plastic surgery to young girls @entity111 , of parents ' rights group @entity114 , told the @entity103 the game sends a dangerous message to young girls			1
he said : " it is one thing if a child recognizes it as a silly and stupid game			0
" but the danger is that a nine - year - old fails to appreciate the irony and sees the @entity62 as a cool role model			0
then the game becomes a hazard and a menace			0
" one parent also told @entity103 the creators were irresponsible			0
@entity128 said he was appalled when he saw his daughters @entity130 , nine , and @entity131 , 14 , playing the game			0
@entity128 , 42 , an accountant , said : " i noticed them looking at possible breast operations and facelifts for their bimbos at the game 's plastic surgery clinic			0
" @entity130 is far too young for that kind of thing and it is irresponsible of the site 's creators to be leading young girls astray			1
they are easily influenced at that age as to what is cool			0
" however , the creators of " @entity13 " claim it is " harmless fun			2
" @entity150 , the 23 - year - old web designer from @entity151 , south @entity1 , who created it was quoted in the @entity153 as saying : " it is not a bad influence for young children			2
they learn to take care of their bimbos			0
the missions and goals are morally sound and teach children about the real world			0
" he added : " the breast operations are just one part of the game and we are not encouraging young girls to have them , just reflecting real life			1
