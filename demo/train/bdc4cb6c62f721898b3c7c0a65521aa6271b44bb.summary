-- in a rare interview with an @entity5 television network , @entity2 's embattled president @entity1 denied he is responsible for the violence engulfing his country and distanced himself from the behavior of his armed forces			1
" they are not my forces , " @entity1 told @entity11 's @entity10 in an interview that was broadcast wednesday			1
he was responding to a question about whether he thought his forces had cracked down too hard on protesters over the past nine months			0
" they are forces for the government			2
i do n't own them			0
i do n't own the country			0
so they are not my forces			0
" would n't @entity1 , the commander in chief , have had to give the order for any military actions ? " no , no no , " he said			2
not by your command ? " no , " he said , " on no one 's command			2
there was no command to kill or to be brutal			0
" @entity31 said those members of the armed forces who " went too far " have been disciplined			2
" every ' brute reaction ' was by an individual , not by an institution , that 's what you have to know , " he said in the interview			0
" there is a difference between having a policy to crack down and between having some mistakes committed by some officials			0
there is a big difference			0
" " we do n't kill , " @entity1 said			1
" it 's impossible for anyone in this state to give orders to kill			2
" " no government in the world kills its people , unless it 's led by a crazy person , " @entity1 said			1
defections continued wednesday from @entity1 's forces , some of whom rose up against the regime in a counterattack in @entity64 province , near the @entity66 border , according to the opposition @entity67 , which said it had seized and destroyed a number of military vehicles , including three tanks			1
two @entity1 soldiers were killed and more than 50 were wounded , it said			2
instability and violence have been raging in @entity2 since mid-march , when the @entity1 regime responded brutally to peaceful protests			1
@entity79 @entity78 ban ki - moon , citing 4,000 deaths in @entity2 , told @entity0 he thought @entity1 had gone too far and pledged that the world body was prepared to help			1
" it is important , first of all , that he stops killing people , and he engage immediately with all political forces and their own people , including opposition to find a way out , so that all the people of @entity2 can enjoy genuine freedom and democracy			1
" reports and images of violence have led powers such as the @entity94 , @entity66 , the @entity5 and the @entity95 to impose sanctions against the regime			0
a @entity79 report said the security and military forces have committed crimes against humanity , and several observers , including @entity105 @entity104 , have urged the @entity106 to take up the issue			0
despite international outrage , violence continues as deaths have mounted			0
the @entity110 , an opposition group that organizes and documents protests , said at least 16 people were killed wednesday by security forces			0
@entity0 is unable to verify the reports because @entity2 officials have restricted access to the country by reporters			2
while activist groups blame @entity2 's military and security for deadly violence , @entity2 officials have said they are battling " armed terrorist gangs " that target civilians			1
@entity31 says that most of the people killed , including 1,100 soldiers and police , have been government backers			1
@entity129 , a @entity2 - @entity5 activist with the opposition @entity130 , said @entity1 's denial that he controls the army -- despite the fact that he is @entity2 's commander in chief -- " signals that he is prepping himself for a defense in case of a criminal indictment			1
" @entity140 , a @entity2 expert with the @entity141 , told @entity0 , " the interview clearly shows , we 've actually known this for a while ... this is a man who is just on another planet			1
he 's just in denial of reality			0
we 've been trying to devise a strategy that deals with him as a rational player			0
" " it 's now clear he is a madman in complete denial of the situation in @entity2 , as thousands of videos and journalist reports clearly demonstrate			1
the question is : what is the most efficient way for the @entity2 people and the international community to deal with such a madman ? " @entity164 , @entity165 deputy spokesman , said he finds it " ludicrous that he is attempting to hide behind some sort of shell game , but also some sort of claim that he does n't exercise authority in his own country			1
" @entity176 spokesman @entity175 said , " the increase in death and body counts this month highlights that the @entity2 government relies increasingly on its security and military apparatus as its only solution in the face of increasing isolation at home and overseas			1
" @entity2 is among the @entity188 and @entity189 countries wracked by the " @entity194 " demonstrations that arose after the revolt that toppled @entity193 's longtime strongman in january			2
subsequent uprisings ousted two of the region 's longtime autocrats , @entity196 in @entity199 and @entity200 in @entity201 , and @entity203 's @entity202 has agreed to step down by february			0
@entity0 's @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 contributed to this report			0

the @entity211 says @entity1 's comments not " *credible* "
@entity214 *raises* *specter* of *sectarian* strife
@entity31 : a government that would kill its people is " led by a crazy person "
one @entity2 expert calls @entity1 a " madman "
