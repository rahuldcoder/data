-- @entity1 expelled the @entity3 ambassador and scaled back diplomatic relations at the weekend over @entity3 's prime minister @entity6 's vocal and persistent criticism of the interim government that replaced the former short - lived presidency of @entity9 , who hailed from the @entity10			1
the decision marks the demise of attempts by @entity6 to play a leading role in the @entity15			1
his ideological affinity to the @entity10 was a staging post to influence other @entity20 parties across the @entity22 world in order to restore the regional prestige of @entity3			0
that plan has come crashing down			0
besides @entity1 , @entity3 is now at odds with the majority of the @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and neighboring @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
it is mistrusted by @entity37 and is largely bypassed by the @entity38			0
@entity39 is disappointed by the deepening isolation of this strategically - located republic straddling @entity42 and @entity43			0
to break out of this self - imposed exile , @entity3 has recently sought to mend relations with newly elected @entity33 president @entity46 and @entity34 prime minister @entity47			1
@entity3 foreign minister @entity48 has visited @entity49 and met key @entity51 and @entity52 leaders while also cultivating ties with @entity33			1
@entity3 is seeking the assistance of both countries to contain the fallout from the @entity35 quagmire , including the reduction of the ceaseless flow of refugees along the porous 910km @entity3 - @entity35 border			1
nonetheless , the abrupt change of direction will probably not repair the tensions on a durable basis			0
countries in the region suspect that @entity3 is merely reacting to developments and is not committed to a balanced foreign policy			0
after all , @entity3 's rapid shifts in the past -- from befriending to outright hostility towards @entity47 and @entity35 president @entity73 , for example -- will most likely reinforce those perceptions			1
moreover , the volatility of @entity3 's external posture seems to significantly undermine the once - unassailable appeal of @entity6 to @entity22			2
just two years ago , at the peak of " @entity83 " fever , a @entity80 poll showed that his popularity ratings standing at 80 per cent in @entity32 and above 90 per cent in @entity86 and @entity87			0
similarly , a 2011 survey by @entity89 revealed that his favourability ratings as 78 per cent , 72 per cent and 64 per cent in @entity1 , @entity31 and @entity86 respectively			2
any contemporary polling will , however , arguably reveal plummeting support for @entity3 and @entity6			0
@entity3 is no longer viewed as a template for democratic pluralism , civil liberties and economic rejuvenation after the disproportionate security response to the mainly peaceful @entity100 protests in central @entity101 during may - june of this year			0
@entity102 ranks @entity3 154th in the world in terms of media freedoms compared to 98th several years ago			0
in addition , the golden age marked by a debt - fuelled consumer - driven economic boom , one of @entity3 's crowning achievements , is at an end : as slow " recessionary " growth becomes the new normal for @entity3 , as estimated by the @entity116 , it needs to urgently implement major structural reforms , which does not look likely in the foreseeable future			2
despite the growing challenges to @entity3 's regional position , its @entity120 membership and strategic geographic location ensure that it can not be ignored in the @entity15			1
but that reality is a far cry from the euphoria and expectations that surrounded the rise of @entity3 's regional and global profile over the last decade			2

@entity1 scales back diplomatic relations with @entity3 over criticism of interim government
@entity3 expert @entity133 says @entity3 pm 's attempt to play leading role in @entity15 has failed
@entity133 : @entity3 at odds with most @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35
despite change in circumstances , @entity3 can not be ignored , says @entity133
