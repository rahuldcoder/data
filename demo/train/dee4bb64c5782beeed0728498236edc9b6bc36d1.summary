@entity0 -- six picture frames hang inside a firehouse in @entity4 , each displaying a photograph of a man who died in the aftermath of the worst terrorist attack in @entity11 history			1
" we always say never forget , " said one firefighter from @entity0 's @entity13			2
the grizzled middle - aged man , who did not want to share his name , said president @entity18 's visit to @entity0 was an acknowledgement of " what we 're going through			1
" after nearly a decade of war prompted by the horrific events of september 11 , 2001 , the president traveled to @entity4 thursday to meet with 9/11 survivors and lay a wreath at ground zero , four days after the killing of @entity29 leader @entity28			1
" i wanted to just come up here to thank you , " @entity18 said in prepared remarks , after eating lunch with firefighters and former @entity0 mayor @entity33			1
" this is a symbolic site of the extraordinary sacrifice that was made on that terrible day almost 10 years ago			0
" the president visited with members of @entity40 54 , @entity41 , which lost 15 men after hijackers flew two fully - fueled commercial airliners into the @entity46 's twin towers			2
" obviously we ca n't bring back your friends that were lost , " the president said			0
" i know that each and every one of you not only grieve for them , but have also over the last 10 years dealt with their family			0
" the men of @entity57 left behind 28 children			0
meetings with firefighters were private exchanges , @entity63 officials said , during which the president sought to mark a clear end to a near decade - long hunt for the @entity29 leader			2
" it was a wonderful gesture , based on the news that we got of @entity28 's death , " @entity0 fire chief @entity69 told reporters			1
" for him to come here to see the faces of those killed in 9/11 , " @entity69 said , referring to photographs that hung inside the firehouse of the men who died , " i think it really meant something to him			2
" in a pre-dawn raid in @entity86 monday , a @entity84 seal team fired two bullets that killed @entity28 , the @entity29 leader behind the attacks in @entity0 , @entity90 and @entity91 , which left nearly 3,000 people dead			1
" when those guys took those extraordinary risks going into @entity86 ... they were doing it in the name of your brothers that were lost , " the president told the firefighters			0
@entity63 press secretary @entity102 said thursday 's visit to ground zero -- the former site of the @entity46 -- was intended to " help @entity0 and @entity11 everywhere achieve a sense of closure			2
" it included a moment of silence and a wreath - laying ceremony at the foot of the @entity113 , badly damaged during the attacks and replanted after it was discovered beneath piles of smoldering rubble			0
the solemn ceremony evoked memories of previous presidents reaching out to the @entity11 public at emotional times -- @entity122 after the space shuttle challenger disaster in 1986 , @entity128 after the @entity113 bombing in 1995 , and @entity124 at the same spot in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks			2
" he is trying to bring the country together			0
he is trying to rally spirits and show that when we do come together , we can do anything , " said @entity1 senior political analyst @entity131 , adding that @entity18 was " doing this with a quiet dignity " that " fits well with him " and " fits well with the moment			2
" in addition to @entity33 , the president was accompanied by @entity0 gov. @entity141 , @entity143 gov. @entity142 , @entity0 mayor @entity144 , and @entity146 chairman @entity145			1
@entity131 noted that the presence of @entity33 helped " bring it back full circle , because he became the face of 9/11 of a defiant @entity11 , of an @entity11 that was courageous in the face of adversity			0
" in a separate moment thursday , @entity18 walked over and hugged @entity156 , a 14 - year - old girl who wrote the president a letter explaining how she was handling the loss of her father , @entity160 , who was killed in the attacks			1
behind the president 's security detail -- a small army of secret service members clad in dark suits and sunglasses -- camera - wielding tourists and news crews snapped images of the motorcade as it rumbled through @entity4 , and later of @entity18 's meeting with the friends and family members of those killed during the attacks			1
onlookers meanwhile posed for photographs with firefighters in what appeared to be a day of mixed emotions -- satisfaction at @entity28 's death , but renewed grief for what was lost on 9/11			1
across the city , @entity0 and visitors thought of where they were on that fateful tuesday in september			0
others more quietly remembered friends and family who died			0
" my husband 's here in spirit , " said @entity192 , whose husband , @entity193 , was a bond trader who worked in the @entity46			0
" we 'll never forget what happened here			0
" " i 'm proud today , " she said			0
former president @entity124 , who was in office at the time of the 9/11 attacks , did not appear alongside his successor during thursday 's visit to @entity0			1
a spokesman for @entity124 said he turned down an invitation to attend , citing his desire to remain out of the public spotlight			0
the image of the former president beside firefighters at ground zero once became an emblem of @entity11 's resolve in the war on terror , a term the @entity18 administration has since tried to distance itself from			1
meanwhile , @entity18 's visit to the hallowed site nearly 10 years later left many @entity0 eager to witness the closing chapter of a man once considered the world 's most wanted terrorist .			1
