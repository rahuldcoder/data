-- president @entity1 arrives in @entity2 saturday morning for three days of deal making , cultural engagements and talks on regional and global security			1
he and @entity7 , the @entity8 prime minister , have much to discuss			2
@entity9 is the world 's most powerful democracy ; @entity8 is its largest and most vibrant			1
@entity9 needs @entity8 to stabilize a rough neighborhood ; @entity8 needs @entity9 to counter @entity14 's growing power			1
@entity9 wants to develop a strategic military alliance by arming @entity8 with the modern tools of war ; @entity18 prefers a more limited transactional relationship with @entity20 to replace its depleted @entity22 - era fleet that avoids making @entity8 the operating base of a future conflict			1
@entity9 wants less outsourcing and more trade to create badly needed new jobs at home ; @entity8 , whose protectionist economic tendencies have given way to a meritocracy driven by entrepreneurial spirit , wants more @entity9 visas to train its bright minds and ca n't understand why @entity9 innovation has given way to a defeatist closed - door , anti-immigration mentality			1
president @entity1 's electoral defeat in tuesday 's midterm elections assures domestic gridlock for the remainder of his first term in office			2
prime minister @entity7 's government -- racked by corruption and a bloated bureaucracy -- has shown little interest in executing the reform mandate it was elected to undertake last year			0
roads have not been built			0
taxes have not been streamlined or collected			0
health care is no better			0
a hallmark nuclear pact reached with @entity20 in 2005 to make @entity8 energy self - sufficient threatens to be derailed five years on by reactionary legislation introduced in @entity7 's own party			2
@entity60 separatists riot in the north			0
maoist rebels surge in the east			0
@entity8 , @entity7 must think to himself at times , is nearly ungovernable			2
yet crippled domestic agendas offer both men an opportunity to lead in foreign policy			0
@entity1 must strike a grand bargain with @entity7 that commits both leaders to take steps that create an open - architecture security environment for @entity73			1
intelligence needs to be gathered , analyzed and shared communally to combat threats facing the entire region , not just any one country within it , so the landscape for economic revitalization and political reconciliation improves			2
@entity8 , president @entity1 should tell his hosts , must now assume the responsibilities imposed upon it by its growing political stature and economic power			1
@entity89 , the epicenter of @entity92 extremism , is the obvious place to start			0
@entity7 refuses to engage @entity89 beyond superficial matters because he argues , with cause , that whatever is left of his political clout would evaporate if one more @entity2 - style terror attack was launched from @entity89 soil			0
as @entity101 often did during the course of @entity105 - @entity104 peace negotiations , @entity73 's terror groups would surely attack at any sign of rapprochement between @entity108 and @entity18			0
what are peacemakers to do ? @entity1 must offer to bridge the trust gap that keeps @entity8 and @entity89 apart on security , economic and political issues			1
he should start by asking his military commanders to bring @entity8 and @entity89 army and intelligence chiefs together in secret at a neutral location ( @entity119 , @entity120 ; @entity121 , @entity122 ; or @entity123 , @entity124 ) so they can reformulate conditions for sharing critical intelligence			1
the countries ' former intelligence chiefs , @entity129 of @entity8 and gen. @entity130 of @entity89 , did just that from 2003 until 2005 with stunningly effective results			2
@entity135 military and intelligence officials could join in after the primary @entity8 - @entity89 relationship is framed			1
through such cooperation , @entity8 might find grounds for taking @entity89 into confidence on its operations to stabilize @entity135 's economy and to assist in rebuilding its domestic police and paramilitary forces , allaying @entity89 army enmity and fears of an east - west squeeze play on their borders by @entity18			2
@entity89 could commit , in return , to close down or starve from an operational standpoint camps that support the @entity153 terrorist network in northern waziristan , from which many who would attack @entity8 are trained and ideologically nurtured			2
@entity8 might also get significant , albeit nonpublic , assistance from @entity89 to douse the flames of revolt in @entity160 by encouraging @entity89 - backed separatist leaders to engage with @entity18 in dialogue -- at a minimum , fewer people would then die			0
done correctly , such earnest dialogue could form the basis for a long - term peace contract in the @entity168 enclave			0
@entity1 could then offer @entity9 support for @entity8 's permanent seat at the @entity172 @entity171 if @entity8 demonstrated it was ready to play a major regional role as economic big brother to lesser economies , starting with a trade pact for @entity89			1
jobs to employ today 's extremists in @entity89 through bilateral trade would reduce tomorrow 's pool of would - be bombers who could threaten @entity8 centers of commerce			0
to incent @entity89 to open up , @entity1 could ask his friends in the @entity9 - @entity185 to lobby for congressional passage of textile tariff relief for @entity89 that fuels growth in an industry critical to @entity8 - @entity89 trade : @entity8 - @entity9 helping @entity89 trade get off the ground -- detente indeed			1
finally , @entity1 could lean on his @entity8 host to invite @entity89 's president over for a summit			1
@entity197 , inept and ineffective as he might seem to outsiders , is perhaps in greater control of @entity89 's political machinery than most give him credit for			0
and while @entity89 's generals despise what they consider his corrupt ways , @entity197 's commercial instincts will serve him well in using trade as a cornerstone for peace with his eastern neighbors			0
if @entity7 reaches across the divide and offers a political breakthrough that gives @entity197 a face - saving reason to say " yes " to peace , he might be surprised at how fast the @entity89 leader accepts the chance to rise above the politics of distrust and dissension and engage in making peace across the array of issues that divide both nations			1
@entity8 must learn , as @entity9 did long ago , that with power comes responsibility to take care of those less fortunate around it			1
in a region where ultra-power ( @entity14 ) and ultra-poverty ( @entity135 ) co-exist , @entity8 must take advantage of @entity9 's experience and its energetic president to bring peace and prosperity to the region in a manner befitting its rising global stature			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			0

@entity1 will visit @entity8 with a group of @entity9 business executives
@entity240 says trip offers opportunity for a grand bargain with @entity8
by striking a deal on economic , military , security issues , the two nations would benefit , he says
@entity240 : progress on peace in the region and in the fight against terrorism could result
