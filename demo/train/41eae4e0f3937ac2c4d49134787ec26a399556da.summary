@entity0 is a foreign affairs analyst who hosts " @entity1 " on @entity2 at 1 and 5 p.m. et sundays			2
@entity0 says granting autonomy to groups generally produces peace and stability			2
( @entity2 ) -- the @entity7 says the key to stopping violence around the world is to stop " destructive emotion			0
" in an interview to air sunday on @entity2 's " gps , " he tells @entity0 that he does n't think even @entity14 wished for violence when he was a child but that it grew of out hatred and frustration			0
the @entity7 also addressed relations between @entity19 and @entity20 in the interview , which @entity0 discussed with @entity2			1
@entity2 : why is @entity19 such a hot - button issue for @entity20 ? @entity0 : @entity20 sees the issue as a separatist movement , as president @entity24 did when the @entity25 wanted to secede from the @entity26			1
they feel their territorial integrity is being threatened			0
and @entity29 see their culture , language and religion as being slowly but surely extinguished by the @entity20			1
@entity2 : so who 's right ? @entity0 : well , that depends on who you ask			0
you need to look at the history to get a complete picture			1
it all goes back to @entity40 , who captured @entity19 in 1207			0
he united @entity19 Â» with @entity20 under the @entity41			1
the @entity20 have claimed an unbroken line of sovereignty over @entity19 ever since			1
the @entity29 , however , reject that claim , saying they have been an independent kingdom for many periods during that time , some centuries long			2
that was the situation until 1912 , when @entity19 declared itself an independent republic			1
@entity20 never recognized it , nor did the @entity51 or any major western power			2
@entity2 : well , that seems to indicate that @entity20 has a point			0
does it ? @entity0 : it 's not so simple , because although @entity20 never recognized an independent @entity19 , neither did it exercise any control of @entity19			1
that is , until 1950 , when chairman @entity59 sent the @entity60 in to liberate -- as the @entity20 saw it -- the @entity29 people from the feudal serfdom they were living under			1
however , the @entity29 saw the act as an invasion , and in 1959 , the political and spiritual leader of the @entity29 people , the @entity7 , fled to @entity68 , where he set up a government in exile			2
@entity2 : so we 've been with the current situation since 1959			0
why has n't there been any resolution ? @entity0 : well , the @entity20 are hoping to wait it out			2
by letting the issue drag on , they are hoping more and more ethnic @entity78 move into the region and slowly let the @entity29 freedom movement die out			0
@entity2 : will it work ? @entity0 : that could happen -- and has worked with other regions			0
but , it could also work the other way			0
the @entity20 sometimes use force , as they did last year against the @entity29 monks , which causes a huge backlash in @entity19 and outside			1
this has resulted in some @entity29 becoming more strident in their calls for independence and aggressive in their demands			2
however , the @entity7 has repeatedly said that he does not seek independence , only cultural autonomy , and urged his followers to engage in no violent protests whatsoever			1
if there were ever a leader of a separatist group whom one could negotiate with , he 's it			0
and once the 72 - year - old @entity7 passes from the scene , @entity102 might have to deal with a far more unpredictable and radical @entity29 movement			2
@entity2 : do you think granting what the @entity7 is asking for makes sense ? @entity0 : if you look at other cases , such as in @entity111 and @entity68 , granting autonomy to groups that press for it has in the end produced a more stable and peaceful national climate			1
but that is a lesson the @entity20 government will have to learn for itself ; it is unlikely to take instruction from outsiders			0
@entity2 : what ultimately causes this age - old mistrust between the @entity20 and the @entity7 ? what 's the stumbling block that keeps them from finding resolution ? @entity0 : the @entity20 government has always believed that when the @entity7 speaks of " autonomy , " what he really means is independence , a sovereign nation for @entity19			1
i asked the @entity7 about this , and he denied it vehemently			0
he insists that @entity29 would truly be content to live within the @entity20 system , as citizens of its government , as long as they are allowed to preserve their culture and practice their religion			1
it is difficult to see how this gap -- the difference in perception between the two sides -- can be bridged			0
e-mail me gps@cnn.com to let me know your thoughts .			0
