-- why do we laugh ? if you believe @entity4 , it 's the same reason why we dream : to satisfy unconscious desires that society usually forbids			1
so there must be a wink behind the strange and wonderful new season of " @entity10 , " which often uses dream logic in place of jokes			1
the second episode , " model , " finds @entity10 ( @entity16 ) hooking up with a rich young beauty ( @entity18 ) whose astronaut father walked on the moon			1
when he admits that things like this do n't usually happen to him , the woman shrugs , " well , maybe it 's not really happening			2
" @entity25 proves @entity16 's ' inside the @entity27 ' theory wrong " @entity31 ″ opens with @entity10 's daughter @entity28 ( @entity28 ) waking from a nightmare , and @entity10 assuring her that the scary dream is over			1
" no , " she insists , " i 'm still dreaming , but ... i 'm having a nice dream now			0
" later , we 're reminded that @entity28 's mother ( @entity35 ) is black , even though @entity28 is blond - haired and blue - eyed , which might make us suspect that we 're dreaming too			0
this is what makes " @entity10 " so brilliant : it takes the type of mundane , familiar moment that fuels so much observational comedy — a random hookup , a rough night with the kids — and pushes it so far past its rational outcome it ends up challenging the idea that the " naturalism " we love from comedians is any less of a false construction than surrealism			2
even the structure of " @entity10 " has always felt like a dream , mixing real - life clips of @entity16 's stand - up with semi-fictionalized moments from his life , cameos from people he knows ( @entity64 and @entity65 pop up this season ) , and references to movies he 's seen — from @entity71 films to @entity73 classics			1
no doubt , @entity16 knows about oneiric theory , which claims that cinema is like dreaming too : it requires us to spend hours in the dark , with our fantasies projected before us , and emerge later into the real world as if we 've just woken up			0
@entity16 releases 1998 film ' tomorrow night ' on website but this is n't just art - house pretension			0
like the gnarliest stuff that your subconscious coughs up at night , its main purpose is to confront the taboo , and whether that means exploring just how far @entity10 will go into the " experimental " side of masturbation in the season premiere or simply digging into his ugliest prejudices about overweight women , the show can be revelatory			1
the third episode , " so did the @entity99 , " might be the most poignant one here , as @entity10 fends off the advances of a self - proclaimed " fat girl " ( @entity98 )			2
her thoughts about what dating is like for plus - size women are so filled with truth , i found myself nodding at the tv , mumbling the kind of " mmm - hmms ! " you hear in church			0
fans can debate whether the very last scene of that episode is too optimistic , but realism is n't the point on a show that once found @entity10 taking fuzzy ducklings on a magical journey to @entity120			1
it 's like the astronaut 's daughter says : none of this is happening			0
but it 's a nice dream just the same			2
