@entity0 , @entity1 -- they 'd gone to @entity5 's dentist office in a @entity0 , @entity1 , suburb to have a wisdom tooth pulled or perhaps have their jaw realigned			1
on saturday , scores of his patients were waiting to be checked once again -- this time not to replace missing teeth , say , but to find out whether they 'd been exposed to hepatitis or @entity15			1
by 3 p.m. local time saturday , one hour later than planned , some 420 people -- out of 7,000 of @entity5 's patients from the past six years who health authorities reached out to -- had been screened for hepatitis b , hepatitis c and @entity15 at the @entity23			1
they came after investigators discovered unsanitary , unprofessional conditions at @entity5 's office in @entity27 , 14 miles northeast of @entity0 , that one official said created a " perfect storm " for infections			1
within two weeks , those tested saturday ( and when the screenings resume starting monday ) should get the results back -- all because they 'd gone to see an oral surgeon with 35 years of experience			2
" how do you say you 're sorry to 7,000 people that you could possibly have infected ? " said @entity36 , whose daughter -- a patient of @entity5 's -- spent part of her 18th birthday getting tested			1
@entity5 , 64 , surrendered his dental license on march 20 after health investigators found sterilization , staffing and other infractions			1
" i will tell you that when ... we left , we were just physically kind of sick , " @entity47 , executive director of the @entity48 , said earlier this week			0
" that 's how bad it was , and i 've seen a lot of bad stuff over the years			2
" the dentistry board launched its probe after one of @entity5 's patients came down with hepatitis @entity58 that patient originally tested positive for @entity15 , too , but a subsequent test came back negative , the @entity23 said			1
while other states conduct random inspections of dentist offices with some regularity , @entity62 told the @entity68 newspaper that dentists ' offices in @entity1 are inspected only after a complaint is filed			0
5 things to check at the dentist 's office investigators raised a number of sterilization and " cross-contamination " alarms -- such as " unauthorized , unlicensed " employees using ivs to sedate patients and that needles were n't handled properly			1
the outward cleanliness of the office belied the mess elsewhere , @entity62 said , noting that " just basic universal precautions for blood - borne pathogens " were n't followed			0
besides being " unlocked and unattended , " the drug cabinet was rife with issues -- containing , for example , a drug that expired in 1993 -- according to the official complaint filed before the state dental board			2
other records showed that morphine had been used in patients throughout 2012 , even though the dentist had not received a morphine delivery since 2009			2
@entity5 and his attorney have not returned multiple calls from @entity2			1
and the oral surgeon was n't home when a @entity2 crew went there on saturday			0
" he seems highly competent to me , just a smart guy , " said @entity105 , one of @entity5 's neighbors			1
" i was just shocked when i heard it			0
and i feel badly for him			0
i feel badly for his patients			0
" a teenage patient , who asked not to be named , told @entity2 he had a bad experience at @entity5 's office a year ago			1
during a surgery to remove three molars , he awoke momentarily to see profuse bleeding			0
he said he became alarmed but was told to " shut up " and hold gauze in place			0
when he awoke a second time , he was tied up on the floor			0
@entity5 's staff explained that he had been " combative " during the operation , he said			1
@entity126 's office a ' perfect storm ' for @entity15 , hepatitis exposure " i felt when i got out of there and went through all i went through , i felt they did n't know much of what they were doing at all , " he said			1
@entity134 's teenage daughter , @entity133 , said she finds it " horrifying " that her june 2011 visit to get her wisdom teeth extracted may have put her at risk for @entity15 or hepatitis			1
she remembered thinking of @entity5 as a " really nice guy " -- but that was then			2
" i 'm angry , " she said			0
" i feel like he 's ... let us down			0
i feel like he 's let a lot of people down			2
" the @entity147 provides national guidelines for dental offices to help prevent the spread of infections			0
they include cleaning and sterilizing all nondisposable items such as dental tools between patients , disinfecting surfaces and requiring staff members to wear protective masks , gloves and eye wear			0
since 1991 , only three cases of dental infection in patients have been documented -- two with hepatitis b and one with @entity15 , according to the @entity147			1
no cases of hepatitis c have been reported			0
" this is exceedingly rare , " said dr. @entity168 , a consumer adviser and spokesman for the @entity171 , of the allegations levied against @entity5			2
" i 'm just angry , because this is a case , i think , so far outside of the bounds of normal that it makes it remarkable			0
" the infection risks are compounded given that @entity5 told investigators he had a higher - than - normal population proportionally of @entity15 and hepatitis patients , @entity62 said			1
@entity15 is a condition that over time destroys a body 's immune system , thus its ability to fight infections			1
if not treated , nearly all those infected with @entity15 will develop @entity186 , according to the @entity187			2
hepatitis -- the most common types being hepatitis a , @entity191 -- refers to inflammation or viral infections of one 's liver			2
some 4.4 million @entity196 have chronic hepatitis , though most of them do n't know it , the @entity147 says			0
@entity1 dentist let unlicensed staffers give @entity201 , state official says @entity2 's @entity202 and @entity203 contributed to this report .			0
