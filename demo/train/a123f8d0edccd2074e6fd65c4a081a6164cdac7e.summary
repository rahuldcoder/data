-- a federal judge has stayed what would be the nation 's first military execution since 1961 , saying the @entity6 soldier -- who was convicted of rape and murder two decades ago -- should have more time to pursue a federal appeal			1
pvt. @entity10 has been on the military 's death row at @entity13 , @entity14 , since 1988			1
a court - martial panel sitting at @entity16 , @entity17 , unanimously convicted him of committing two murders and other crimes in the @entity21 , @entity17 , area and sentenced him to death			1
last month , the @entity23 said @entity10 was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection december 10 at the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			1
but in an order issued november 26 , @entity6 district judge @entity28 of @entity14 said that a stay is necessary so @entity10 can pursue his federal appeal			1
@entity28 ruled on a motion filed by @entity10 's attorneys , who asked for time to challenge the legality of his convictions and sentence			2
government attorneys have asked @entity28 to reconsider his decision , saying that @entity10 seeks a stay " apparently based on the premise that at some point he will identify a new legal issue or discover new evidence " upon which to appeal and that @entity10 " continues to delay unnecessarily			2
" @entity10 has had ample time to appeal , the @entity47 attorneys said			1
in a response filed tuesday , @entity10 's defense attorneys point out that the @entity6 @entity51 declined to hear his appeal in march 2001 , and " since then , it has taken the @entity53 , the @entity55 , the @entity47 and the @entity54 over seven years to approve as final private @entity10 's sentence of death			1
the significant constitutional issues presented on the face of private @entity10 's case ... have obviously troubled the decision - makers , as evidenced by the years they had his case under advisement			2
" president @entity66 approved @entity10 's death sentence in july , making it final , defense attorneys write in the filing			2
inmates sentenced to death in state and federal courts are given a year to file federal appeals after their death sentence becomes final , they claim , and members of the military under death sentences should receive the same consideration			0
" private @entity10 is seeking federal habeas court review for the first time and he has not delayed commencing this action , " defense attorney @entity81 wrote			1
" in fact , until the president approved his death sentence , there was no action available			0
" @entity10 was convicted of raping and killing a female @entity23 private and a civilian near his post at @entity16			2
he also was convicted of the rape and attempted murder of another fellow soldier in her barracks at the post			0
military and civilian courts both found @entity10 responsible for the crimes , which were committed between april 1986 and january 1987			0
@entity10 pleaded guilty to two murders and five rapes in a civilian court and was sentenced to three consecutive and five concurrent life terms			0
the general court - martial at @entity16 then tried him and in april 1988 convicted him of two murders , an attempted murder and three rapes			0
@entity66 's july action , the @entity23 said in a statement at the time , followed " completion of a full appellate process , which upheld the conviction and sentence to death			0
" members of the @entity6 military have been executed throughout history , but just 10 have been executed with presidential approval since 1951 under the @entity121 , the military 's modern - day legal system			0
the @entity23 has also sought @entity66 's authorization to execute another condemned soldier , pvt. @entity124 , who was convicted of killing and robbing two cab drivers in 1988			0
the last @entity6 military execution was in 1961 , when @entity23 pvt. @entity127 was hanged for raping and attempting to kill an 11 - year - old @entity129 girl			1
@entity127 was sentenced in 1955			0
the @entity6 military has n't actively pursued an execution for a military prisoner since president @entity132 commuted a death sentence in 1962			1
nine men are currently on military death row			2
@entity0 's @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
