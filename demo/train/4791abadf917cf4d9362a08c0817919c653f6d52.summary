@entity0 -- for much of this year , we 've read about the @entity4 uprisings , leading to the downfall of leaders in @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
now , we 're facing the prospect of a more fundamental overhaul in western nations : a @entity13			2
the ongoing fiscal crisis in the eurozone is taking its political toll on the leaders of the troubled economies			1
one by one , they fall			2
in the south , developments are accompanied by drama			2
@entity24 's @entity23 resigned , after two years in office , as a precondition for the creation of a coalition government in @entity24			1
@entity30 's @entity29 , whose fall has been predicted for years because of his business dealings and private life choices , has stepped down			2
but the dominoes do n't stop with these @entity35 countries			0
@entity36 of @entity37 faces a close to impossible re-election in the spring			0
the @entity37 are weary of austerity , but their country will continue to have to make cuts in order to withstand market pressures and hope for a return to growth			2
chancellor @entity47 of @entity48 is faring badly in the polls as the economy there slows down and the money for bailouts will most likely need to increase			0
@entity55 prime minister @entity54 , is not even seeking a third term in the november 20 elections			0
unemployment is at 21 % and the economic downturn there continues			0
regardless of the fates of these leaders , several overriding questions remain			2
what will citizens need to understand in order to accept a significant change in lifestyle and prospects ? after ousting one set of politicians will they then be willing to go through the pain of more austerity and elusive growth , or will each new government face even stronger opposition ? is there a realistic way out of this financial crisis that does not entail hardship for the people ? citizens do not appreciate experimentation			1
they value a clear road map they can understand : it has a beginning , a middle and an end			0
conflicting opinions , the residue of a democracy , nonetheless breed confusion and a false sense that somewhere , someone is hiding the easy way out			0
people then search for scapegoats and saviors , identify conspiracies and blame the powers that be			2
coalition governments alone will not be sufficient for people to get on board			1
a clear pan-european plan that will unite the continent should be immediately under way			1
the largest political groups , such as the @entity109 , the @entity110 , @entity112 @entity111 and the @entity113 , to name a few , must come together with the @entity114 and undertake this challenge			1
the commission has been working on economic proposals to address the fiscal crisis and the economic governance in the @entity114			0
there are talks about treaty revisions			0
but there are also , concurrently , discussions about moving to a two - speed @entity125			0
this only heightens insecurity and resentment			0
but there is some good news			0
many of the unifying elements are already in place			0
across the @entity13 there is consensus on the transition to a low - carbon economy , to create green jobs , protect the environment , invest in education and r&d and to manage resources more efficiently			0
the @entity114 has treaties binding members together , and over the decades a strong @entity112 identity has emerged that helps citizens feel at home throughout the @entity114 and adds value to their national identity and heritage			1
sadly , the current fiscal crisis has wreaked havoc and obscured all these positive policies that helped make @entity112 what it is today : a modern society that provides political , economic and personal security to its many peoples			1
@entity112 has strengthened its democratic institutions , provided funding for its weaker members , incorporated new members after the fall of the @entity164 , given voice to its citizens and led the way in reversing the effects of climate change , the greatest challenge of our time			1
what @entity112 needs now is more , not less , @entity112			1
in a world where size matters , @entity112 need to re-start the engines and not allow the fiscal crisis or the markets to send them back to the days when borders , national enmities , national currencies and nationalism itself ruled the day			1
today 's world requires cooperation on every front , and the economy is just one more test we need to pass , one challenge we have to face in order to move confidently into the future as @entity112 who are writing a new chapter in our common history			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			1

one by one , leaders in @entity112 's troubled economies are falling , says @entity203
@entity199 : will each country 's new government face even stronger opposition ?
coalition governments alone will not be sufficient for people to get on board , she says
a pan-european plan that will unite the continent should be *urgently* under way , she says
