-- i am a product of the " @entity2			1
" it shaped me into who i am today : a @entity7 pastor aware of @entity9 's amazing grace and love			1
when i announced i was gay , the church limited that grace and love			1
although i had no doubt that @entity9 loved me , i discovered that @entity9 's love and the church 's love can be two different things			1
to be @entity7 is to be inclusive of people who love one another			1
this is why i support same - sex marriage			2
as a pastor , i have counseled countless heterosexual and homosexual couples , and have observed that no matter the race , background or sexual orientation of the couple , a healthy relationship requires commitment , genuine respect and mutual love			1
though my partner and i had a commitment ceremony in 2003 , and obtained a marriage license this past july in @entity37 , we learned that marriage is more than our religious convictions and our commitment , but also about laws that will protect us			1
marriage equality is not about religious rights , but the right to equal benefits			1
at the end of 2003 , the @entity46 identified 1,138 federal provisions where marital status is a factor in determining or receiving benefits , rights and privileges			2
these include next - of - kin hospital visits and medical decisions where one partner is too ill to be competent ; automatic inheritance in the absence of a will and inheritance of jointly owned real and personal property through the right of survivorship			2
these benefits allow all marriages access to the social and emotional supports that can produce healthy families and communities			2
i affirm the role of religion in our society			0
but no matter how powerful religion is , in the @entity79 , the laws of the church and the laws of the government are intentionally separate			2
another view from the pulpit : same - sex marriages will hurt families in 1968 , 73 percent of @entity79 disapproved of marriage between blacks and whites			2
then , it was argued that interracial marriage would hurt families and dismantle societal structures			0
in 1967 , the supreme court ended race - based restrictions on marriage in loving vs. @entity94			0
today , support of interracial marriage is stronger than it has ever been			0
so is support of same - sex marriage			0
like interracial couples , gay couples are seeking equality under the law , asking their government for these rights , not individuals , or religious bodies			1
if same - sex marriage is about love and religion is about love , then in this debate , love must go both ways			1
we must not be hateful in our disagreements over marriage			0
verbal and emotional abuse should have no place in our sacred places of worship			0
the pulpit should not be used as a place of abuse even if one disagrees with same - sex marriage			0
@entity124 never mentioned homosexuality in his 33 years of life			0
but in @entity127 , he did emphasize , " ... thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself			0
there is none other commandment greater than these			0
" the apostle @entity136 said : " be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love ; in honor preferring one another			0
" i wonder what the debate over same - sex - marriage would be like if we applied this basic scripture ? true equality can begin when we see others as we see ourselves			0
i believe there is room to disagree , but just because we do n't agree on my legal rights does not mean i am not entitled to them			0
the gay community must also learn how to love those who disagree with them			1
if heterosexual couples and gay couples could see their commonality , equality would not just be the law of the land , but it could be a new law for humanity that governs our fragile future			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			1

@entity166 says he is a product of " the @entity2 , " which helped shape him into a pastor
when he announced he was gay , he found that @entity9 's love and the church 's love can differ
he and partner married ; he says he realized marriage about right to equal benefits under law
@entity166 : gay and heterosexual couples must see their commonality
