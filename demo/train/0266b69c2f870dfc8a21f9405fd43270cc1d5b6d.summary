the sale of the old house , the purchase of the new house , the packing , the good - bye parties			2
it was all so overwhelming for me			2
i ca n't imagine what it was like for my toddler , leaving the only home , neighborhood and sitter she had ever known in the city where she was born			2
fortunately , i got a little bit of help from the @entity18 to give my daughter some answers			1
in that classic tale " @entity26 , " @entity21 asked the questions about moving that my daughter asked : " what about my toys ? " " and what about my friends ? " she 'd carry that book around like a teddy bear			1
the answer for the toys was easy : " we 'll take them along , of course			2
" @entity36 to hear : " you 'll be leaving your friends behind			2
" " but you can keep in touch with them			2
you can write , even visit perhaps			2
and besides , you can make lots of new friends			0
" it 's no wonder that i could find a @entity46 book for almost any new or difficult situation			1
when co-author @entity46 died last month , she had written more than 330 " @entity18 " books , first with her husband , @entity50 ( who died in 2005 ) , and later with her son , @entity51			1
more than 260 million copies have been sold over the past 50 years , making it one of the best - selling children 's book series in history , @entity52 said			1
mirroring all types of families growing up in a house filled with books , i turned to children 's literature to explore and learn about worlds beyond my experience			1
now , i turn to the classics of children 's literature for assistance in parenting my way through the basic struggles in our lives , such as feelings , friendships , sharing , courtesy , differences and loss , among others			1
if the @entity18 did n't have the answers , maybe dr. @entity78 , " @entity79 , " " @entity80 " or " @entity81 " could do the trick			1
the classics explained essential subjects to a young mind better than i ever could , and they reassured me , too			0
still , some of the classics did n't represent our experience or the lives of many of the families we know and love			1
my child has two moms			1
her neighborhood friend has one mom who adopted her			0
her friend across the street has a mom and dad			0
" as families have changed over the past decades , that means that there 's opportunity for books to serve families who may not be made up of @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , " said @entity102 , children 's reviews editor for @entity104			1
" there 's certainly a need for books that portray , mirror and show the value in all kinds of families : same - sex families , mixed - race families , stepfamilies , families with grandparents as guardians			1
" just as interesting are the children 's books that include a diversity of families not as the point of the story but as a reflection of the reality of our world			1
" that sort of subtle , offhand inclusion and portrayal of a diversity of families in picture books -- as well as books for older readers -- is , in my view , as valuable , if not more so , as having an increased number of message - focused books out there on those topics , though there will always be a place and a need for those , too , " says @entity102			1
here are some of my family 's modern favorites			1
it 's ok to be different the bright visuals of writer and illustrator @entity161 's books jumped out at my daughter before we ever guessed the subject matter			1
in @entity161 's world , there are different types of mommies , families and feelings -- all of them valuable and filled with love -- without getting hit over the head by the message			1
" @entity179 " shows all the families on my block and beyond , and portrays them as different in appearance but equal and loving and kind			1
" @entity193 " teaches my kid that mommies come in all shapes and sizes ; some work outside the home , and some work inside the home ; some cook , and others order pizza ; and some camp , and some shop			0
a visual learner and slow reader , @entity161 remembers having trouble learning when schools did n't know how to help him			0
" when i started writing books , i based them on my own struggles as a kid and feeling like an outsider , " said @entity161 , whose favorite books as child included classics such as @entity203 's " @entity202 , " dr. @entity78 's " @entity204 " and " @entity205 " from @entity206			1
" i wanted them to be silly and fun and simple but yet be something strong that could help kids feel good about themselves			0
i wanted it to be matter of fact that everyone is important and special and different			0
" why not let your child drive the bus ? after i became a parent in @entity224 , my daughter and i loved that we could identify the locations that @entity228 featured in " @entity229 : a @entity230			0
" yes , we lived across the street from the actual @entity232 featured in the book			0
for a city kid , the idea of sitting on a stoop , @entity232 across the street and parks within walking distance made sense in the whimsical pictures drawn by the former @entity206 writer			0
" do n't let the @entity243 " and " do n't let the @entity244 " play with the neverending asking that a child does for what she wants , with increasingly sophisticated reasons why we parents should give in			0
it 's daytime in @entity252 ? really ? but children are not trying to drive us nuts , @entity253 gently reminds the reader			1
adults forget how hard it can be to be a child , where nothing is built to your size and grownups demand that you learn new things every single day			0
why not throw a tantrum over not getting to drive a bus or go to bed whenever you want ? " i do n't see my books as ends but as beginnings , " said @entity253 , who as a child loved the work of @entity276 illustrator @entity275 and " sneetches on the @entity278 " by dr. @entity78			2
" i put as much air in as possible so kids can put in their own ideas			0
draw my characters and put as few words and background as possible so kids can create them themselves			0
" while @entity253 is grateful that children identify with his work , he says he writes to understand things he does n't understand , such as friendship , love and jealousy			2
( " the @entity295 gets a cookie ! ? " which comes out in april , turns jealousy on its head			0
) " i 'll write a book and take it very seriously for a year or two , " he said			0
in " goldilocks and the @entity305 , " out this fall , " i find my past self telling my present self how to deal with some present relationships in my life			0
" you do n't have a mommy and a daddy ? " @entity310 " author and poet @entity312 started writing children 's books featuring families with two mommies or two daddies after a friend stopped her on the street and demanded that she write books featuring families like hers			1
my daughter had never heard a story with two mommies			0
she grabbed at the picture book " @entity329 , " and memorized all the words			0
( the companion , " @entity332 " works for the two - daddy family			0
) she gravitated to " @entity334 has two mommies " as she got older			0
although her books have been attacked as political , @entity312 says she does n't write with an agenda or mission			2
" i write to tell a story , " said @entity312 , who remembers reading dr. @entity78 , @entity339 , @entity340 the elephant and " @entity342 " as favorites			0
" i write to find out what i do n't know			0
if pressed , i 'd say my goal would be to produce a children 's book that would help any child reading that book to feel good about herself			1
" we 're all connected a sweet summer day in the life of an interracial family is the setting for @entity356 's picture book " @entity361 , " featuring the art of @entity358 ( who received a @entity359 for this book )			2
the book is about global connectivity , showing families and partners of all ages and races			2
as she started writing for children , @entity356 noticed themes of nature and community emerging in her work			2
" i also really think about a child 's perspective : how would they envision friendship ? what would they notice about places or parties or food or trees ? " said @entity356 , whose favorite books growing up were " @entity377 , " " @entity295 " and " @entity378			1
" " kids are relatively disempowered			0
they 're just not the big people in charge			0
so i really try to think about how children 's books can give some of the power back to them , just by granting importance to their perspective			1
" read about @entity395 staffers ' favorite children 's books .			1

the @entity18 often had the answers to children 's questions
many moms and dads turn to classic books for assistance in parenting
children 's books now include a diversity of families as a reflection of our world
