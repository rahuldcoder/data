-- @entity4 - @entity3 sniping over @entity6 's growing conflict is n't the early frost of a new @entity8 , but it highlights the chilly spots that remain between the onetime foes , longtime observers say			1
the @entity12 administration came into office promising a " reset " of relations with @entity22 after the 2008 conflict between @entity3 and the former @entity16 republic of @entity17 , a prospective @entity19 ally			2
that helped pave the way for a new strategic arms control treaty , a revamping of @entity4 missile defense plans that @entity3 opposed and greater @entity3 support for sanctions aimed at curbing @entity31 's nuclear development			1
" i think that the good ties that are associated with the reset came from an analysis from both sides that there were issues where both sides had a set of common interests , and both sides could pursue those interests and do business with one another , " said @entity32 , the dean of the @entity33 and a veteran @entity3 analyst			1
@entity49 nations must ' do what 's necessary ' to boost world economy , @entity12 says however , @entity32 added , " what we 've seen recently is there are still issues that divide the @entity4 and @entity3 , on issues where there are n't common interests			1
" and topping that list today is @entity6 , where president @entity60 's crackdown on a popular uprising spawned by the " @entity64 " revolts across the region now threatens to become a full - blown civil war			2
at least 10,000 people have been killed -- opposition groups say 13,000 -- and a @entity70 - @entity69 cease - fire plan has all but collapsed			0
the @entity4 , its western allies and leading @entity73 states have condemned @entity60 , whose family has ruled @entity6 since 1971			1
but @entity3 has stood behind its longtime allies in @entity76 , blocking action in the @entity78 and warning against outside intervention on behalf of the opposition			2
president @entity12 and @entity3 president @entity82 met monday on the sidelines of the @entity49 in @entity84 , @entity85 , and discussed the @entity6 conflict			1
it was the first face - to - face talk between the two leaders since @entity82 returned to the president 's office this year			0
after the nearly two - hour talk , @entity12 said the two had " agreed that we need to see a cessation of the violence , that a political process has to be created to prevent civil war			0
" about a third of the session was devoted to @entity6 , said @entity100 , @entity4 ambassador to @entity3			1
both @entity12 and @entity82 " wanted to make sure the other side of the table understood the true motivations for what they 're trying to do and what they 're trying not to do			0
" the tension between @entity107 and @entity22 flared last week when @entity4 secretary of state @entity108 accused @entity3 of shipping helicopters to @entity6 , where opposition groups say they are being used against civilians			1
@entity3 foreign minister @entity112 said thursday that his government is n't selling @entity60 any equipment that could be used against protesters , just delivering air defense systems under contracts struck years ago -- though another @entity3 official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told @entity0 that @entity3 is refurbishing older copters it had sold previously			2
on monday , @entity123 marine insurer @entity122 said it had stopped coverage for @entity3 operator @entity126 's cargo ship , @entity127 , amid allegations that the ship is carrying weapons to @entity6			2
ship - tracking data showed the @entity127 was off the northern coast of @entity133 on monday			0
@entity4 officials have said the ship is heading for @entity6 with attack helicopters and munitions			2
@entity4 officials said friday they were tracking the @entity139 , a @entity3 military cargo ship believed to be bound for @entity6			1
@entity141 , @entity3 's state - run news agency , denied the report monday , citing a source in the @entity144 as saying the @entity139 remained docked at its base in @entity147			2
@entity3 stood aside as the @entity78 authorized international intervention in the @entity150 revolt that toppled longtime strongman @entity151 in 2011			2
but @entity6 " is a place where @entity3 has real interests at stake , " said @entity152 , deputy director of the @entity3 - @entity154 program at the @entity155 in @entity107			1
" the problem for the @entity3 is @entity60 just is n't very effective , " he said			2
rather than crushing the revolt against him , " it seems that everything he does just inflames it even more			0
" that gives the @entity4 and its allies the opening to put more pressure on @entity60 , who took power after his father 's death in 2000			0
" the @entity3 would love to see those arguments go away and get back to geopolitics , " @entity152 said			0
" but those arguments are not going to go away while more civilians are getting killed , and the @entity3 understand that			0
" ' entire families trapped under the rubble , ' @entity6 opposition says meanwhile , he said officials in @entity22 see @entity4 support for the @entity6 opposition as another " encroachment " on their backyard			2
" they see this in part of the same continuum of what 's been happening in post-soviet states over the past decade , " @entity152 said			0
previous @entity4 support for reform movements in former @entity16 republics " creates a bunch of problems in the neighborhood , " while the @entity4 stance against @entity31 's nuclear program is seen as another push for " regime change , " he said			1
and @entity202 , a former @entity4 ambassador to @entity203 and assistant secretary of state in the @entity206 administration , told @entity0 's " @entity212 " program that the top @entity3 priority is " that at the end of the day , @entity6 not be taken out from the @entity3 column and put in the @entity4 column			1
" " we do n't have a very good track record on reassuring them of that , because essentially , that 's what we 've gone around doing since the @entity8 , " he said			0
" so , there 's a real mistrust of our intentions there , notwithstanding assurances that we might be trying to give there			0
" but neither side wants to see the @entity6 conflict spread to neighboring countries such as @entity227 , which has been torn between pro- and @entity229 factions in recent years			0
and the @entity4 needs @entity3 help with @entity31 , which has defied @entity70 demands that it stop producing nuclear fuel amid @entity233 and @entity203 accusations that it is driving toward nuclear weapons			1
opinion : why @entity82 ca n't be forced to deal that could leave @entity107 in a grim position , @entity202 said			0
" it is a real irony that on the one hand , we 're expecting @entity112 to go off to @entity242 in these coming days and deliver a more flexible position on the part of @entity31 towards the offer that 's on the table in the nuclear talks that are going to take place in @entity22 , in which we 're heavily dependent on the @entity3 to cooperate with us and pressure the @entity31 , " he said			1
" and at the same time , we 're beating them over the head for being too supportive of the @entity60 regime , particularly by providing these attack helicopters			0
" it 's a very hard balancing game , and there is this tension between them that is not easily reconciled , " @entity202 said			0
" so , ultimately , i think we 're going to have to decide which one is more important to us			0
and i suspect that , at the end of the day , it will be the @entity31 issue and the nuclear weapons programs we run that trumps concern about what 's happening in @entity6			1
" and @entity32 said the @entity6 crisis is a reminder that " fundamental differences " remain between the former @entity8 antagonists , " and what 's happening in @entity6 exposes the limits of the relationship between @entity4 and @entity3			1
" " it 's not the @entity8			0
it 's not going to be the @entity8 , " he said			0
but the dispute over @entity6 " could be as serious as the @entity17 war , because it does expose a @entity3 approach that is fundamentally at odds with @entity233 interests -- really , in this case everyone else 's interests			1
" @entity6 - bound @entity3 cargo ship loses insurance @entity0 's @entity288 contributed to this report .			1

@entity6 may strain @entity4 - @entity3 ties , but they still need each other , observers say
@entity6 " is a place where @entity3 has real interests at stake , " @entity155 analyst says
the @entity4 needs @entity3 help in the @entity31 nuclear talks , former *diplomat* says
