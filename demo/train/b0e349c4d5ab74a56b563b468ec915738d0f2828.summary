@entity0 , @entity1 -- in their new apartment in @entity0 , the vibrant and cosmopolitan capital of @entity1 , @entity5 and his girlfriend unpack their last suitcases , still trying to settle in their new surroundings			1
the @entity12 couple relocated to the southeastern @entity14 country a few months ago , making a deliberate career move to swap the economic uncertainty of their crisis - hit country for the prospect of a better future abroad			1
they are part of a growing @entity12 community fleeing the severe eurozone crisis in search for jobs and economic opportunities in their country 's former colony			1
" in @entity32 everybody is a little bit afraid with their own future because ( of ) the crisis , worldwide crisis , in terms of economics , " says @entity5 , a marketing director who has head - hunted to work in @entity0			0
" once we start to enter the labor business , once we start to work , we understand that to plan the future is a little bit more difficult than what you expected			0
" although @entity1 gained its independence from @entity12 in 1975 , and retains @entity12 as its national language , many in the @entity14 country continued until recently to see the former colonial power as a land of opportunity			1
but now , with @entity12 mired in financial woes amid a worsening @entity32 debt crisis , that notion is increasingly being reversed			1
how @entity1 turned from war zone to tourist hotspot in the @entity12 consulate in @entity0 , consul general @entity56 says she 's seen a rise in experienced , university - educated @entity12 migrating to @entity1 looking for a brighter future			1
" in the last two or three years , people began to come increasingly , " she says			0
" lots of people for small investments , some others working with the companies , some others working contract by other people			0
so a variety of people			0
" in addition to the common language , the familiar architecture and the rich culture , the main draw for @entity12 in @entity1 is the country 's impressive economic performance in recent years			1
in 2011 , @entity1 's real gross domestic product grew by 7.2 % , boosted by the country 's first overseas export of coal , as well as strong performances by the transport , communications , construction and financial services sectors , according to the @entity86			1
the country 's economy is also forecast to grow by 7.5 % and 7.9 % in 2012 and 2013 respectively -- an alluring incentive for those @entity12 wishing to escape the lack of opportunity back home			1
locals in @entity0 say the new arrivals from @entity12 fly into @entity1 nearly every day			1
" none of us is facing financial difficulties or is unemployed , " says @entity12 entrepreneur @entity95			1
" what we envisage is to find places for the future because in the next five to 10 years @entity12 will slow down and stagnate			2
" we want to find places like @entity1 where there is the reverse , where we have sustainable growth for the next five to 10 years			2
" the @entity106 looking to make it in @entity108 one of many new @entity12 immigrants in @entity0 is @entity110			2
the 32 - year - old left @entity112 in january and now she is working for @entity113 , a successful @entity14 consumer goods company , helping to promote and sell tea , biscuits and coffee to @entity1 's growing middle class			2
she says she 's now earning more than she did back home , works shorter hours , and can afford a car , cell phone and insurance			0
" new life , new country , " says @entity123 , explaining that she can now build her future -- something she did n't dare to do in @entity12 where many are struggling under the weight of austerity and unemployment is at around 15 %			1
" we have jobs here and the language is the same , " adds @entity123			0
" we have opportunity here			0
" yet it 's not only the cosmopolitan @entity0 that 's attracting large numbers of @entity12			2
the recent discoveries of vast reserves of coal and gas off @entity1 's northern coast have also sparked a big swell of investment in the country as well as the emergence of second industries in the towns around the mines			1
according to the consul general , there are many @entity12 who are bypassing @entity0 to set up restaurants , join small companies or offer skills in these frontier towns			2
" people are moving outside @entity0 and are even beginning their businesses outside of @entity0 , " says @entity157			0
" so it is very interesting			0
it could be very useful also			0
" why @entity163 giants scent opportunity in @entity106 as for the @entity1 , locals say there has been little backlash to the return of the @entity12 to the country -- this time , however , under very different circumstances compared to the colonial era			1
" yes , they 're coming but i think ( it 's ) really positive , " says economist @entity172			0
he explains that the new businesses that are being set up create jobs for local @entity1 , while the influx of foreign skills help the country 's development			1
also , government quotas on the number of foreigners that a company can hire ensure that local jobs are protected			0
yet , notwithstanding the recent improvements , life in @entity1 , which is still one of the poorest countries in the world , is not without challenges			2
@entity123 says her biggest concern in @entity0 is security while @entity5 notes that he is frustrated with the slow pace of life compared to @entity32			0
" it 's a little bit more difficult to make things happen than it is in @entity32 , " he says			0
" @entity1 is a challenge every day			2
" but despite all the difficulties , it is here where @entity5 and many of his compatriots have chosen to develop their careers			0
and if @entity12 's economy remains stuck in turmoil , many others could follow them , lured by @entity1 's growing and untapped opportunity			1
