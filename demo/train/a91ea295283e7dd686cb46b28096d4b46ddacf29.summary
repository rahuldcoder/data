following talks with the @entity3 government , secretary of state @entity0 said the @entity4 is making progress in the war on terror , and hopes to end the use of drone strikes " very soon			1
" the secretary of state told a @entity3 television station that president @entity11 has a " very real timeline " for ending the strikes			1
he did not provide specifics on the timeline			0
" we hope it 's going to be very , very soon , " @entity0 said thursday , according to a transcript provided by the @entity17			1
" i believe that we 're on a good track			0
i think the program will end as we have eliminated most of the threat and continue to eliminate it , " @entity0 said			2
he added that the cessation depends on " a number of factors " and that @entity27 is working on it with the @entity3 government			2
a @entity17 statement later addressed @entity0 's remarks			2
" today , the secretary referenced the changes that we expect to take place in that program over the course of time , but there is no exact timeline to provide , " the statement said			2
however , it said , the goal is to get to a place where threats are eliminated and drones are not needed			0
" now , we 're all realistic about the fact that there is a threat that remains and that we have to keep up ... the fight in this and other places around the world , " @entity44 , a @entity17 spokeswoman , said			0
" so this was in no way indicating a change in policy			0
it 's really been reinforcing things i think we 've said for months on this			0
" the @entity4 ramped up strikes in the tribal region in the first few years of @entity11 's presidency			1
but the number of strikes in @entity3 has since dropped partly because of @entity66 's decline in the country and more @entity4 focus on threats from @entity66 groups in other countries , such as @entity72			1
in may , @entity11 defended the use of drone strikes as a necessary evil , but one that must be used with more temperance as the @entity4 ' security situation evolves			1
@entity4 prefers to capture , interrogate and prosecute terrorists , but there are times when this is n't possible , @entity11 said in a speech at the @entity82 in @entity27			2
terrorists intentionally hide in remote locations and putting boots on the ground is often out of the question , he said			0
however , he urged caution and discipline			0
" to say a military tactic is legal , or even effective , is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance , " @entity11 said at the time			0
" for the same progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power -- or risk abusing it			0
" increased oversight is important , but not easy , @entity11 said			1
drone strikes in the tribal regions bordering @entity104 have drawn heated opposition in @entity3 because of civilian casualties			1
the drone strikes have further roiled relations between the two nations , which flared following a 2011 raid by @entity4 commandos on a compound in @entity113 , @entity3 , that killed @entity66 leader @entity114 .			1

@entity11 has a " very real timeline " for ending the strikes , @entity0 says
but the @entity17 says " there is no exact timeline "
@entity11 : increased oversight is important , but not easy
the number of @entity4 drone strikes in @entity3 has dropped in recent years
