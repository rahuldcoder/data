-- the @entity1 is expected to meet tuesday to consider a proposed resolution to authorize more sanctions against @entity4 following the secretive regime 's controversial nuclear test last month			1
@entity7 said the underground nuclear blast it conducted on february 12 was more powerful than its two previous detonations and used a smaller , lighter device , suggesting advances in its weapons program			0
it was the first nuclear test the isolated state has carried out since its young leader , @entity17 , inherited power in december 2011 after the death of his father , @entity20 , who made building up @entity4 's military strength the focus of his 17 - year rule			1
like the regime 's previous tests in 2006 and 2009 , the move prompted widespread international condemnation , as well as a promise of tough action at the @entity30			2
the @entity31 and @entity32 , a key @entity4 ally , have been negotiating for weeks on the wording of the proposed resolution			1
@entity32 's ' dissatisfaction ' @entity37 's government on tuesday said it strives for a " nuclear free peninsula			2
" it repeated its support for the @entity1 's condemnation of @entity4 's nuclear tests but also called for a muted response to it			1
" @entity32 suggests the @entity1 to keep a discreet , proper reaction to avoid the situation from escalating , " the @entity45 said at a media briefing tuesday			2
@entity4 's government regularly rails vehemently against sanctions imposed on it			1
as a permanent member of the @entity1 with veto power , @entity32 can strongly influence the body 's decisions and has previously resisted strong sanctions on the @entity20 regime , which it props up economically			2
the two communist countries have been close allies , since @entity32 backed the @entity4 in the @entity61 in the 1950s			2
the @entity31 backed the @entity62 in the conflict , fighting side by side with its troops			0
the two koreas are still officially in a state of war , though an armistice signed in 1953 ended the bloodshed			0
analysts say @entity37 wants to maintain the @entity4 as a buffer between its border and @entity74 , a @entity31 ally			0
immediately after @entity7 's nuclear test , @entity37 expressed its " dissatisfaction , " noting that it took place " despite the international community 's widespread opposition			1
" details of the proposed resolution remained unclear late monday in @entity83			0
@entity85 , another veto holder , will support a resolution on @entity4 if it does n't go beyond " missile and nuclear issues , " @entity85 deputy foreign minister @entity84 said tuesday , according to the @entity85 news agency @entity90			1
" a text focused on missile and nuclear issues linked to @entity4 will be acceptable for us , " @entity84 told @entity90			0
the meeting tuesday at which the text is expected to be presented is set to begin at 11 a.m. , according to the @entity30 media office			1
a previous @entity1 resolution in january that broadened sanctions on @entity4 in response to a long - range rocket launch angered @entity7			1
two days after that resolution was passed , the regime announced it would carry out the nuclear test			2
the rocket launch in december apparently succeeded in putting a satellite in orbit , a move @entity4 said was for peaceful purposes			0
but the launch was widely considered to be a test of ballistic missile technology			0
@entity7 has said its nuclear tests and other weapons programs are a deterrent against the @entity31 and its allies			0
but @entity4 state media regularly publish articles directing aggressive rhetoric against @entity118 and @entity119			0
" @entity4 's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs constitute a threat to @entity31 national security and to international peace and security , " president @entity120 said after the @entity4 's nuclear test last month			1
@entity0 's @entity128 contributed to this report .			0
