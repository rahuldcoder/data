@entity0 have once again blocked an extension of benefits intended to aid the long - term unemployed			1
thursday 's vote in the @entity4 was third time @entity5 have attempted unsuccessfully to pass legislation intended to help some 1.7 million people who have had their benefits cut off since the recession - era program expired on december 28			1
it has been extended 11 times since 2008 and doing so again is popular with 60 % of @entity12 behind it , according to national polls			1
but the @entity0 - led @entity15 has yet to take any action and the majority of @entity0 members in the @entity4 do n't want it renewed			1
it does n't seem like good politics but it is a position @entity0 are sticking to			1
why ? the deficit they commonly point to the deficit			0
" the better way to go is to not add to the deficit in an irresponsible way , " @entity0 sen. @entity23 of @entity24 said			1
" i obviously have people in my state who would benefit			0
" @entity23 supports an extension , but says he wants it paid for			0
in the @entity4 proposal , which would cost about $ 6 billion for three months , @entity5 offered a way to pay for the program that involved increased employee contribution to pension programs			1
" we compromised on how to pay for it			0
we compromised on the offset that we would use , that is acceptable , i think , to both sides now , " @entity5 sen. @entity38 of @entity39 said			1
but @entity0 have moved the goal post			2
now they have another demand			0
they want an increase to military retiree cost - of - living payments , which would add more to the deficit , requiring additional cuts to the federal budget			0
" if @entity4 @entity5 allow a vote on my amendment , we 'd have a solution that could immediately deliver temporary help to those looking for work , prevent military retirement benefit cuts , and reduce the deficit , " @entity51 sen. @entity50 said			2
2.3 million children have a long - term unemployed parent amendments it 's wonky			0
but it 's common parlance in the @entity4			0
republicans and @entity5 are constantly fighting over amendments			2
in short , the @entity0 want to offer them to alter bills but complain that @entity5 wo n't allow them			1
unfortunately , this one is hard to referee because it all comes down to perspective			0
@entity5 say they are offering @entity0 plenty of opportunity to amend the unemployment bill and @entity0 disagree			1
" we said , ' @entity74			0
let both sides offer amendments -- a whole lot of amendments			0
then bring up the bill for a vote			0
' so throughout this process , we 've moved toward our colleagues across the aisle , time and time again , " said sen. @entity81 of @entity82			0
but according to @entity88 , sen. @entity86 , @entity87 , said " the unemployment insurance bill has been blocked , again , because we 're not allowed amendments			1
" unemployment benefits breeds unemployment the conservative group , @entity93 , says unemployment benefits simply offer an incentive to remain unemployed			1
opinion : jobless benefits do n't cause unemployment " the policy is bad , " a spokesman for the group , @entity100 , said			2
in december , sen. @entity102 of @entity103 said that extended unemployment benefits result in people becoming " part of this perpetual unemployed group in our economy			1
and it really - while it seems good , it actually does a disservice to the people you 're trying to help			0
" @entity5 have a bit of a different perspective , believing that people do n't chose to be unemployed			2
" what ( @entity0 ) want is to know what the 57 - year - old woman in @entity118 is going to do to stop couch surfing , " senate majority leader @entity116 said			2
ineffective ineffective is another word used in @entity0 circles			2
@entity124 , scholar at the @entity125 , said unemployment insurance does n't help workers gain new skills or move to areas with jobs			2
he said it has " failed to deliver demonstrable results			0
" " @entity135 should recognize the inherent ineffectiveness of trying to help people find work through a program that has evolved into a poorly operating welfare program , " @entity124 said in a recent column for @entity134			0
@entity141 , spokesman for the @entity4 @entity0 campaign arm , said unemployment insurance is n't working as millions of frustrated long - term jobless have stopped looking for work			1
" here 's the dirty little secret : it is n't working because people are n't finding jobs , " @entity141 said			0
" we need to focus on solutions to end long - term unemployment and focus on jobs - and president @entity155 and @entity4 @entity5 simply are n't up to the task			1
" @entity5 argue that this is not meant to be a job placement program but a critical safety net .			1
