-- it 's every @entity3 parent 's nightmare : seeing your son being led away in handcuffs when you know he 's done nothing wrong			1
the surreal scene happened to me one recent morning			1
while sitting in my backyard i heard adult male voices around the side of the house			1
i opened the gate and saw a white police officer handcuffing my 13 - year - old son			1
the plainclothes @entity19 , @entity20 , officer and his partner did not identify themselves as police			1
they did not ask our son 's age or where he lived			1
they told him first to put his hands up and then handcuffed him			1
they assumed he was guilty , of what we did n't know			0
his crime appeared to be that he was a black male			1
later , we would listen to the 911 tape of what preceded the incident			0
it was apparent police had targeted my son while he was riding his bike home from a friend 's house			1
why ? according to officers , he fit the description of a burglary suspect who had allegedly entered a nearby home			0
the description they offered : a black male wearing cargo shorts			1
our son was wearing cargo shorts , but that identification could have applied to hundreds of black males in @entity19 on that particular day			1
why did n't the 911 dispatcher ask for a more detailed description of his skin color ? his build ? whether he had facial hair ? ( he does n't			0
) whether he had a tattoo or piercings ? ( he does n't			0
) or whether he was wearing a hat ? ( he was			0
) authorities on the scene did n't care about my son 's other attributes			1
he is an honor roll student , saxophone player , basketball player and law - abiding teenager			0
all they saw was his gender and race			0
to make matters worse , after handcuffing him , police paraded him to the front of our house in full view of neighbors and passersby , and at least three other armed , uniformed officers surrounded him and me			1
they leaned him against a cop car , his hands still cuffed behind him , and made him wait so the alleged victim could be driven over to identify him in what 's known as a " show up			1
" when i protested , asking why my son needed to be handcuffed , they told me he might flee			1
give me a break ! he 's going to try to run with five armed cops and his mother standing near him ? the humiliation of being forced to participate in a quasi-lineup was unconscionable			1
when the alleged victim said our son was not the intruder , the officer uncuffed him and his partners left almost as quickly as they had swarmed in			1
but before the officer who handcuffed our son left , i demanded an apology			1
the halfhearted response seemed insincere at best			0
he did n't even look either of us in the eyes			0
these officers clearly did not like it that i verbally resisted my son 's detainment or my telling them it seemed like racial profiling			1
that police could handcuff a fully cooperating , nonresisting 13 - year - old boy at his home with his mother in plain sight ought to leave all @entity118 shaking in their boots			1
it was unfair -- un-american			0
but it happens more often than we know , particularly to young african - americans , who often do n't have the resources to advocate for themselves			0
this is the @entity118 , where one is supposed to be innocent until proven guilty			0
but this rarely applies if you 're a male of @entity3 descent			0
@entity132 's killer has claimed self - defense , but did @entity132 deserve to be approached by a neighborhood watchman and shot to death ? he was carrying a bag with soda and some @entity139 candy , not a weapon			1
i 'm reminded of the 2009 incident involving @entity144 professor @entity143 , one of the nation 's top @entity3 - @entity3 scholars			1
@entity143 returned home to find his key would n't work because his lock was jammed			0
initially , police thought he was breaking into his own home			1
even though he produced identification to prove he lived in the house , he was ultimately arrested for disorderly conduct after he angrily accused officers of racial profiling			1
i teach at @entity159 , which is home to the @entity161 , a program whose work has overturned wrongful convictions and influenced @entity20 gov. @entity167 's effort to end the state 's death penalty			2
it 's not surprising that many of those exonerated are @entity3 men			2
in fact , the @entity173 of @entity174 tracked 958 former convicts exonerated in the @entity118			0
of that total , 45 % were @entity3 - @entity3 men , even though they make up only about 6 % -7 % of the country 's population			2
racial profiling has a long history in the @entity118 and there seems to be little relief in the so - called " age of @entity186			0
" a 2009 @entity188 report called racial and ethnic profiling " a widespread and pervasive problem throughout the @entity118 , impacting the lives of millions of people in @entity3 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity196 communities			0
" in 2012 it continues to be a common rite of passage for young black males			2
just ask any black male you know and he will tell you a story			2
no wonder some hate the police			2
my husband and i can not undo what happened to our son			1
at 13 he is now officially inducted into black manhood			1
i shudder to think what could have happened if i had not been home			2
thank @entity214 we had taught him at around age 10 to cooperate with police			2
he complied in every way			0
but what if he 'd gotten scared and run ? what if he had reached for his cell phone and police thought it was a weapon ? the officers never patted him down			2
what if police had planted something on him ? what if the victim had lied and said my son was the perpetrator ? to be sure , police officers have a tough and dangerous job and are vulnerable to injury at a moment 's notice			1
they should try to catch criminals , but not at the expense of treating people with respect and dignity			0
we have to fight crime without automatically indicting black males			2
the @entity188 report concluded that alienating marginalized groups would ultimately prevent police from reducing crime			2
when police make mistakes , they must own up to them			2
they could have identified themselves first and politely asked my son some questions with me present			2
they also could have profusely apologized			0
despite our harrowing experience , i know we are lucky			0
it was 10 minutes of our lives			0
the truth prevailed and we will move on			0
but we will never be the same			0
the incident is forever seared into my brain and is giving me sleepless nights			0
the worry i already had for my son being away from home or school is now magnified right at the time he wants to be more independent			2
we 've told our son that he should n't think all police officers are bad			1
however , it is clear more training of @entity19 dispatchers and police officers is needed			2
to parents of @entity3 youth , as your children ( particularly males ) return to the routine of classes and homework , remember to school them about the police			0
they are not always their friends			0
it 's unfair that black parents have to teach this lesson while most white parents do n't			1
but if we do n't educate them early and often we may be sending them to an early grave			0

@entity294 : recently her son , 13 , was stopped , handcuffed by police
she says it happened next to her house , she *objected* , they said they were seeking burglar
she says her son was stopped because he was black
