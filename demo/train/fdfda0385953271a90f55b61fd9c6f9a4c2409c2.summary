@entity0 , @entity1 -- doctors prescribed 2,360 pills to @entity10 in the month before her death , a number that prosecutors told jurors tuesday was evidence of a conspiracy to feed her drug addiction			1
" you 've all heard she was a strong gal , " said @entity0 deputy district attorney @entity15 during her closing argument tuesday			1
" but when she 's medicated , she 's way more compliant			0
" @entity15 argued that her boyfriend - lawyer @entity19 conspired with two doctors to keep the reality tv star drugged much of the last three years of her life			1
on the judge 's advice , @entity15 kept her closing arguments to four hours , less than the full day she had predicted she would use tuesday			1
defense lawyers began their closing arguments tuesday afternoon , making it likely the jury would begin deliberations in the two - month trial by thursday			1
in their closing arguments monday , prosecutors portrayed the actress as a lying , drug - seeking , out - of - control addict who manipulated two doctors to write excessive prescriptions for dangerous drugs over the last three years of her life			1
@entity39 deputy district attorney @entity38 used two @entity41 portraits to show jurors " what doctors should do , " while painting drs. @entity43 and @entity44 as physicians who fed @entity10 's addiction instead of treating her illnesses			1
doctors have a responsibility to protect patients " even from themselves , " @entity38 said			0
@entity19 and the doctors are accused of conspiring to feed the reality tv star and @entity58 model 's drug addiction and using false names to obtain the drugs			1
the defendants are not charged in @entity10 's february 2007 death , which a @entity64 medical examiner ruled was from an accidental overdose of a sleep aid , a lethal mix of prescription drugs and a viral flu			1
judge @entity70 has been highly critical of the prosecution 's case , suggesting it was built from " a dead celebrity and a bunch of low - level misdemeanors			1
" the judge said he decided to allow the case to go forward after another respected judge advised him to trust the jury system			2
@entity70 has questioned whether the prosecution has proved that @entity10 was an addict , as defined by @entity1 law , and not just dependent on drugs to relieve chronic pain			1
" if she 's being treated for pain , it 's not illegal , " @entity70 said last week			0
@entity38 , the first of two prosecutors to deliver closing arguments , said that at some point during the last three years of @entity10 's life , @entity43 and @entity44 were no longer treating @entity10 's pain , " but were prescribing to treat her addiction			1
" " there is not a single physical test done on @entity10 during the time dr. @entity44 is treating her , " @entity38 said			2
he also said that @entity43 kept no medical records of her care for @entity10 , but simply used her " prescription pad power " to provide controlled drugs to her			2
both doctors crossed ethical lines by developing personal friendships with @entity10 , @entity38 told jurors			1
" a doctor ca n't be both a physician and a friend , " @entity38 said			0
he reminded jurors of photos shown earlier of @entity43 naked with @entity10 in a hot tub at her @entity113 home months before her death			2
" she is writing prescriptions to keep @entity10 euphoric , not to treat a medical condition , " the prosecutor said			2
he also read entries from @entity44 's personal diary , written after he and @entity10 attended a gay pride event			1
" i was making out with @entity10 , my patient , blurring the lines , " @entity44 's diary said			1
another diary entry was evidence @entity44 knew his prescriptions for @entity10 were illegal , @entity38 said			2
" i give her methadone , @entity128			0
can she ruin me ? " evidence that @entity10 was an addict dates back to 1996 , when she voluntarily entered the @entity130 , he argued			0
@entity44 should have recognized that @entity10 was an addict when she first came to his office in april 2004 and asked for one of the most powerful painkillers available , @entity38 said			0
" @entity10 liked @entity134 , " he said			0
" she asked for what she liked			0
" @entity44 gave her another prescription for @entity134 six weeks later , when @entity10 complained of pain from two ribs broken in a may 27 , 2004 , @entity140 accident			0
" if she was on @entity134 at the time she cracked her ribs , certainly she should n't be on a @entity140 , " @entity38 said			0
@entity44 ordered no x-rays or tests and did not take the time to call another doctor who treated her the day of the accident , he said			0
@entity10 got @entity134 from four different doctors that month , he said			1
a doctor who treated @entity10 at @entity149 in june 2006 testified that she concluded @entity10 was addicted to drugs , @entity38 told jurors			0
when dr. @entity152 asked @entity44 then if @entity10 had any addiction issues , @entity44 laughed and said there have been some issues , @entity38 said			2
two charges against @entity19 were thrown out by @entity70 , who questioned the evidence that @entity19 , a lawyer , knew it was illegal to get drugs in multiple names			0
" it has all the hallmarks of a kitchen sink prosecution , " @entity70 said last week			0
" it looks like the prosecution is throwing everything in with the hope that something will survive			0
" @entity70 hinted that if the defendants are found guilty , he would consider " possible selective prosecution issues " when sentencing them			0
during the trial , prosecutors showed a 13 - minute video of @entity10 bathing with her infant daughter months before her death to support their argument that @entity10 's speech was slurred and her mind was groggy from drugs			1
jurors were not allowed to see the video , which also shows @entity10 talking in a childlike manner during a birthday party for a 9 - year - old girl			2
the defense does not deny that @entity10 took a lot of drugs , but it says the doctors were treating her for chronic pain that other doctors had also diagnosed			2
the prosecution 's case was hampered by several key witnesses ' recanting details of earlier statements , including a former nanny who said she never saw @entity19 injecting @entity10 with a needle			1
