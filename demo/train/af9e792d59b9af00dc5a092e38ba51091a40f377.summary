-- there 's a fine line between success and failure in top - level sports , perhaps nowhere more so than in track and field sprint events			1
@entity7 knows how true that is			2
the @entity8 was a triple world champion in 2007 , but since then has seen @entity10 usurp him in the most spectacular way with records and titles galore			1
however , the difference between them is still only a few hundredths of a second			0
" it 's a huge difference -- not on paper , but in the race it is			2
in a race , a loss is a loss and you can see it clearly			0
so that 's why i want to get what 's on paper a lot closer , " @entity7 told @entity0 's aiming for @entity25 show			1
his quickest time over the 100 meters is 9.69 seconds , set in @entity31 in 2009			2
that matched @entity10 's effort in winning @entity35 gold in @entity36 the previous year			1
when they went head to head at the 2009 world championships , @entity7 clocked 9.71 -- good enough for second place only as the @entity42 took his title with a new record 9.58			1
" if i do my best and i do n't win then i have to be satisfied with that , " the 29 - year - old @entity46 native said			2
" so when i ran 9.71 , i was mad i did n't run 9.69 , but it was so close that it was almost like i could n't be mad because i knew that we worked to do what we tried to do , and i just took the loss			2
" gay has only beaten @entity10 once in a 100m final , in 2010 , and also had the edge in the 200m final at the 2007 worlds			1
but a hamstring injury suffered in the 2008 @entity8 @entity35 trials sent his performances into a spiral , and he did not qualify for the 100m final in @entity36			1
overcoming adversity " it was like coming off a high and going to the lowest point of my life in a span of 12 months , " he said			2
" being a champion i wanted to follow up with an @entity35 medal , and after going through the trials and having the @entity8 record in the 100m dash i was feeling good , and then i pulled my hamstring in the 200m and that 's when things just changed			1
" i was down trying to rehab it , trying to go through a lot of things , ups and downs , struggles mentally trying to get my mind together			0
" it was very tough			0
i believe when you run track and field , you 're on that thin line between running too fast in practice , running too fast in meets , not having enough time to recover and so forth -- and that 's just something i had to learn to deal with over the years			0
" gay insists he is in much better shape to finally achieve his dream at this year 's @entity35 in @entity98			0
" i really believe that i 'm going to be healthy this year and that 's what i 'm looking forward to , " he said			0
" last year for me to run with basically one leg , i ran 9.7			0
i can be a lot more dangerous , as long as i stay healthy and get a lot stronger in the weight room			0
" off - track issues the @entity42 sprint team was hit by a doping scandal ahead of the 2009 world championships which saw five members -- not including @entity10 -- under scrutiny , and last year their compatriot @entity111 was handed a lifetime ban after testing positive for a masking agent			1
gay 's fellow @entity8 , former world and @entity35 champion @entity115 , is on the comeback trail after serving a four - year ban for steroid use			1
with that context , @entity98 2012 organizers have said that this @entity121 will be heavily scrutinized to make sure illegal doping does not occur			0
" that 's one thing i respect about having the @entity121 here in @entity98 , they do n't play no games and they were big on the anti-doping thing , " @entity7 said			1
" there 's a possibility that they 're a little bit less forgiving than @entity8 is when it comes to that and i really respect them for that			1
" family man gay is only too aware that he is a role model for aspiring athletes -- including his daughter @entity139			0
" she is not a little girl anymore and she is at the age when she understands what i 'm doing , so now i 'm at a point where i want to be involved in more of her sports , " he said			0
" last year was one of the first times going to one of her track meets and it was pretty amazing to watch her run and compete and still keep her spirits up high you when she did n't win			0
" in that sense i am trying to balance my time so i can watch her career and i can finish up my career			0
" with that in mind , @entity7 is aware that @entity98 may provide his best chance to achieve his @entity35 goals and leave a golden legacy			2
" i really believe this is going to be one of the most exciting @entity35 ever in history , and i like a challenge			0
i want to run with the best , run against the best ; that 's how i 've always lived , " said @entity7 , who has strong ideas of how he 'd like to be recalled in the history books			1
" as a great runner , as a clean runner , someone who accomplished things without going the other route			1
being remembered as someone who gave his all , who ran with his heart			1
i want to capitalize that with a medal in the @entity35 -- a gold medal			0

@entity8 sprinter @entity7 is **hoping** to prove a point at the @entity184
the 2007 triple world champion missed the @entity36 100 meter final after struggling with injury
he is **hoping** to prevent @entity42 's world record - *holder* @entity10 defending his three titles
@entity7 says he wants to be remembered as a clean runner , " someone who ran with his heart "
