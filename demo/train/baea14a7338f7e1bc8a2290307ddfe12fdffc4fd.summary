-- a dna link may signal a break in a 36 - year - old investigation into the slaying of four children , the @entity2 , @entity3 , prosecutor 's office announced tuesday			1
the so - called @entity9 is believed to be responsible for the deaths of @entity11 , 12 , @entity12 , 12 , @entity13 , 10 , and @entity14 , 11 , who were kidnapped and found dead between 1976 and 1977			1
using technology unavailable to investigators at the time of the crimes , the @entity18 dna unit at @entity19 tested and analyzed human hairs found on the bodies of @entity11 and @entity14 , the prosecutor 's office said			1
investigators were able to establish a mitochondrial dna , or @entity28 , profile link between the hairs , establishing they came from the same person , essentially proving the two crimes were connected			1
source : dna at @entity34 protest similar to material on victim 's cd player " this is the first piece of evidence that actually links any of the victims together			1
it was always believed that these two killings were linked to the same person , however that was an assumption based on the similarities in the crime , " said @entity42 , @entity43			1
armed with proof the boys ' death was connected , authorities pulled up more evidence from the 1970s investigation			1
at the time , police had found a person of interest and were able to search his car			2
the car was a 1966 @entity60			0
the investigators took samples from the interior of the car and found small hairs , fibers and fur			2
they were placed in evidence where they remained for decades , until this material , too , was submitted to the @entity18 dna unit for testing and analysis			1
according to prosecutors , the testing revealed that the hairs recovered from the @entity60 had the same @entity28 profile as the hairs recovered from the boys ' bodies			2
the owner of the car , 70 - year - old @entity80 , is serving a life sentence for two counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree			0
@entity80 was tested for a dna match , but it was determined he did not share the same dna profile : the hairs found on the boys and in the car were not his			1
" it is believed that @entity80 would allow others to use his 1966 @entity60 , as well as the other described vehicles , so investigators are looking for information concerning any other people who may have used this car , or had access to any of these vehicles			0
finding anyone like this who turns out to be the donor of the hair may be the key to solving these two murders , " @entity100 said			0
cold case : ' @entity109 ' suspect pleads not guilty the @entity28 results are not absolute			2
according to prosecutors , the hairs recovered from the boys ' bodies were not suitable for autosomal dna testing , or nuclear dna testing , the testing most commonly referred to in movies and television			1
investigators had to use @entity28 testing , which is less definitive than autosomal dna testing			1
" with nuclear , autosomal dna ... you 're dealing with absolute identification			2
it 's like a fingerprint , unique to each person except twins , " said dr. @entity126 , forensic scientist at @entity127 , " @entity28 is completely different			0
if you have a hair from a person , that person 's siblings and all maternal relatives would share that mitochondrial profile			0
it 's not unique to a particular person			0
" on the other hand , @entity126 said an @entity28 link is still significant , and enough to cast suspicion on anyone who shares the @entity28 profile , " people have been convicted on @entity28 evidence alone , " he said			0
authorities are hopeful the new evidence will help them catch the killer			0
" we are excited about this new opportunity , " said @entity2 sheriff @entity150 , " this haunts every police officer who was around then and is around today			0
" authorities encourage anyone with information to call the tip line at 1 - 800 - 442 - 7766			0
tv movie on ' @entity160 ' leads to @entity161 of remains of woman missing since ' 82			0

@entity9 thought responsible in four ' 70s deaths
@entity18 used *modern* dna testing to study hairs found in the investigation
officials say the results give solid evidence the killings are linked
