-- federal officials postponed poisoning a mile - long stretch of the @entity4 's banks this week after residents complained that doing so posed health and environmental risks on both sides of the @entity11 - @entity10 border			1
a @entity12 agent moves through dense cane on the banks of the @entity4 near @entity15 , @entity16 , last year			1
@entity17 said it wants to eradicate the invasive @entity19 cane infesting many portions of the @entity4 's banks between @entity16 and @entity10			1
the lanky cane provides cover for immigrants crossing the border illegally and poses a danger to @entity12 agents trying to stop them , said @entity28 , spokesman for @entity17 's @entity15 sector			1
" someone can be in the cane and be 3 feet away from them , and you can not see them , " @entity28 said during a wednesday phone interview			2
" [ a @entity12 agent ] could literally be surrounded and have no idea			1
" the controversy over the test project comes as secretary of state @entity39 visits @entity10 to discuss border security and other issues concerning @entity11 - @entity10 relations			2
applying herbicides on a 1.1 - mile stretch of the @entity11 side of the river was part of a test project , @entity28 said , but the @entity17 decided to postpone the $ 2.1 million experiment to address community concerns			1
residents of two @entity53 communities near @entity15 , @entity16 -- @entity54 and @entity55 -- filed a lawsuit late tuesday asking a federal court to intervene			1
@entity28 said wednesday morning he was unaware of the lawsuit			0
among the complaints in the lawsuit , the communities allege the @entity17 failed to assess the environmental impact adequately , failed to consider reasonable alternatives and failed to notify the public adequately			2
though three herbicides were originally proposed , the @entity65 settled on imazapyr for the test project , @entity28 said			0
the @entity11 @entity69 said there is " reasonable certainty of no harm from aggregate exposure to imazapyr residues			0
" " @entity76 technical is relatively nontoxic via the oral route of exposure , and only slightly toxic via the dermal and inhalation routes of exposure , " the agency has said			0
@entity81 , a vocal opponent of the project and executive director of the @entity84 , said the studies on the herbicide are insufficient			0
" i 've lived long enough to know what the government says is safe is n't always safe , " he said			0
the 1.1 - mile test stretch of the @entity4 forms a sharp bend between @entity15 and @entity15 , @entity10			1
the river serves as a water source for both			2
@entity15 mayor @entity94 said he believes the federal officials have good intentions and that some misinformation has been disseminated regarding the proposal			1
he said he welcomes the delay so that the @entity17 can address community concerns			0
" i 'm going to make sure we protect our police officers and @entity12 , " said @entity94 , a former @entity101 agent			1
" i just want to make sure it will have zero impact on humans , the water , our environment			0
" the @entity17 seeks to use three methods of @entity111 along the stretch of the river : manually cutting the cane and topically applying herbicide to the stalks ; using shovels , pickaxes , excavators and backhoes to dig the cane up by its roots ; and using helicopters to spray the bank aerially			1
the latter is the most troubling , said @entity126 , because aerially spraying could affect more than just the @entity19			1
the @entity17 would evaluate the products of each method before proposing an eradication program for a 16 - mile stretch of the river , @entity28 said , adding that the @entity17 is considering other options as well			1
one option could involve the import of tiny @entity136 wasps , which feed on the cane and lay eggs in it , stunting the cane 's growth			2
@entity19 , which can grow up to 30 feet high , is a @entity143 transplant to @entity16			1
the wasp is a @entity146 native			0
the @entity11 @entity147 is experimenting with the wasp on a different section of the @entity4 and is sharing its data with the @entity17 , @entity28 said			0
the @entity147 has concerns that @entity19 chokes off native plants and has an insatiable thirst , capable of annually sucking up 500 gallons of water per square yard			1
@entity28 said the @entity17 wants to re-evaluate its test proposal because it does n't want to eradicate the cane at " the expense of the environment or anyone who lives in the area			2
" " i own a house in @entity15			1
i drink the water that comes out of the tap , " @entity28 said			0
" we 're trying to do the right thing for everybody involved			0
" in addition to concerns from the @entity11 side of the border , @entity28 said the city of @entity15 also expressed reservations -- namely that the stretch hosting the experiment is near the intake point for @entity15 's water supply			1
@entity126 of the @entity84 said the concerns of @entity15 citizens are warranted because the effects of such widespread use of imazapyr are unclear			1
not only are humans at risk , he said , but there are about 1,000 species residing in the area slated for testing , and the nesting season for migrant birds is quickly approaching			0
opponents are n't against eradicating the @entity19 , @entity126 said			2
they 're not even opposed to using herbicides			0
they just want to make sure that herbicides are used responsibly and in a targeted manner and that the @entity17 considers all options for mitigating the cane			2
for instance , he said , donkeys and goats enjoy eating the cane			2
and earlier this month , about 70 students from @entity203 manually were able to clear about an acre of cane in fewer than three hours			0
" let 's get down to reasonableness , logic and fairness here			0
it 's an issue of morality on one side and of science on the other side , " @entity126 said			0
" we do n't think citizens of either country should be @entity217 pigs			0

@entity219 was to be sprayed on cane along 1.1 - mile stretch of river
tall , thick @entity19 cane provides cover for illegal immigrants , @entity12 says
*hispanic* communities near @entity15 , @entity16 , file suit to stop spraying
residents want consideration of other methods to eliminate cane
