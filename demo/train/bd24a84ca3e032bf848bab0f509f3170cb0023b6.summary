-- when i first started traveling , i was delighted by refrigerator magnets , t - shirts , embroidered patches and snow globes -- all the usual gift - shop kitsch			1
at some point , however , it struck me as a shortcut , celebrating a destination 's clichés rather than the place itself			1
so i moved up to items that were unavailable on every other corner and , ideally , handmade			1
i felt good about supporting craftspeople , and the objects had more personal resonance			1
though when i got them home , many of them turned into dust - catching clutter -- one - of - a - kind clutter , but still			2
moreover , i questioned their authenticity			2
i make every effort to eat at restaurants frequented by locals			2
why would i shop for souvenirs in stores where residents never tread ? now , i hunt for what i call " unsouvenirs			1
" the word souvenir is @entity33 for " remembering , " and unsouvenirs , despite the prefix , must also be able to trigger a memory			2
but they 're different from souvenirs in that they capture the essence of a place not simply because they were purchased there , but because -- this is the important part -- locals actually use them			1
@entity0 : @entity47 's strangest @entity46 souvenirs that 's the best definition for cultural authenticity that i can come up with			1
while i prefer that my unsouvenirs originate in the destination ( " made in @entity53 " is only appealing if you 're in @entity53 ) , i do n't mind if they come from a factory			1
few of us can claim that we incorporate many handmade items into our day - to - day lives			1
i just visited @entity60 for the first time -- ridiculous , i know -- and i was surprised by how rife with kitsch the historic center is			2
rare is the block that does n't have a store selling i © @entity60 t - shirts			1
my customs form , in contrast , looked as if i had run errands on a saturday afternoon			2
i bought a plastic container designed to hold the unsliced part of an onion , premixed @entity74 and soda in @entity77 bottles , a package of assorted paper from an art - supply shop , @entity82 toothpaste , and a lip balm called @entity84			2
they 'll remind me of @entity60 every time i use them ( though i have n't yet been brave enough to whip out the lip balm in public )			1
@entity0 : @entity47 's most beautiful airports certain kinds of stores are more reliable for unsouvenirs			2
supermarkets and pharmacies are always interesting			1
cookware purveyors are also a consistently rich source : you might score @entity100 espresso pots from coffee - crazy @entity101 or elegant woven place mats from understated @entity103			0
at a @entity105 hardware store you could come upon a miniature scythe - style weeder ; or you might spot a cowbell and collar in northern @entity101			0
( part of the fun is repurposing : that bell could be a doorbell			0
) stationery shops , whether you 're in @entity115 or @entity116 , tend to have schoolkids ' notebooks , which make for quirky journals back home			1
also worth a look are stores that sell hobby or restaurant supplies , sporting goods , garden equipment , bike gear ...			0
" you have to get off the map , " agrees the queen of unsouvenirs , @entity128 , co-owner of @entity129 , a store in @entity132 's @entity131 that stocks workaday objects from around the world ( usually one country at a time , displayed in four - to - six - month " exhibitions " ) , all acquired during @entity128 's peripatetic travels			1
highlights from @entity144 included egg cups , a pencil sharpener and a doorstop ; from @entity148 , a mailbox , green twine and a calculator			0
individually , the items are idiosyncratic and well designed ; gathered together , they convey the spirit of a country , in both their utility and their aesthetics			0
( to see what i mean , visit @entity159			0
) i assumed that @entity128 had the same wander - and - hope strategy that i do , but she and her husband and co-owner @entity161 actually do a ton of prep work			0
they research each destination , reading up on the history , culture , museums , food , crafts , anything			0
and they network like mad : " we ask ourselves , ' who do we know from there ? who has relatives there ? ' " most important , they 're usually in a country for two to six weeks , which means they stay -- and shop -- in residential neighborhoods			1
just as the ideal unsouvenir reflects locals ' daily existence , the best way to shop for unsouvenirs is by practicing a bit of cultural immersion -- in other words , when in @entity60 , shop as the @entity192 do			0
as @entity128 and i chatted , i bragged about my onion container , which i consider a symbol of my victory in tourist - clogged @entity60			0
if any other @entity197 traveler brought home a plastic onion this year , i 'll eat mine -- washed down with more than one bottle of @entity202			0
@entity128 's eyes lit up			0
" that 's brilliant , " she said			0
" how does it open ? can you send me a photo ? " maybe someday @entity129 will tackle @entity101 , and my little onion holder will be part of the exhibition			0
that would be fantastic -- as long as we all remember who found it first			0

" @entity227 " is only appealing if you 're in @entity53 , author says
but handmade objects are n't always the best reminders of your trip
supermarkets and pharmacies are interesting places to hunt for useful souvenirs
