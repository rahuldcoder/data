-- @entity1 has rebutted @entity3 's explanation for not checking an international database of lost and stolen passports when passengers boarded @entity7 , an omission that may have allowed two @entity9 men with stolen passports onto the plane			1
@entity3 home minister datuk seri @entity12 told the @entity13 this week that using @entity1 's @entity16 ( @entity15 ) database might have slowed down the process of immigration checks at airport counters			1
he said the country 's immigration 's equipment could not handle the global database of 40.2 million lost passports			2
@entity1 fired back on friday , saying the problem can not be blamed on technology or @entity1			0
" @entity1 's @entity15 database takes just seconds to reveal whether a passport is listed , with recent tests providing results in 0.2 seconds , " the international law enforcement agency said in a statement			1
" the fact is that the @entity33 consults this database more than 230 million times per year ; the @entity37 more than 140 million times ; the @entity39 more than 100 million times and @entity40 more than 29 million times			0
not one of these countries , or indeed any @entity1 member country , has ever stated that the response time is too slow			0
" @entity1 earlier said two @entity9 men , @entity47 , 18 , and @entity48 , 29 , used stolen @entity50 and @entity51 passports to board flight 370			1
the men entered @entity3 using valid @entity9 passports			2
the men have not been linked to terrorism			0
@entity57 is a hub for the sale of stolen or fake passports .			0

two @entity9 men boarded @entity7 with stolen passports
@entity3 says checking passports against @entity1 's database would take too long
@entity1 responds , saying the process is very *speedy*
