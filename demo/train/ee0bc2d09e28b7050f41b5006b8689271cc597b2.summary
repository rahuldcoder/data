it 's a view of the @entity2 shooting we had n't seen before , but could it be enough to shape the way a grand jury handles the controversial case ? an exclusive video first broadcast wednesday on @entity9 shows two construction workers ' reactions just after a police officer shot the unarmed african - american 18 - year - old last month in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the contractors shown in the short video clip told @entity9 they saw @entity2 with his hands up as officer @entity19 pursued him and opened fire			1
several legal analysts describe the video as a " game changer			1
" others said it might not make much of a dent in the case			2
â€‹ here are three reasons legal analysts told @entity9 the video could be important : 1			1
the witnesses it depicts are white and do n't live in @entity14			0
the race of the witnesses should n't matter , but it could for the grand jury that 's investigating the case , said @entity36 , a @entity9 legal analyst and criminal defense attorney			1
there are nine whites and three african - americans on the 12 - member panel tasked with deciding whether @entity19 , who is white , should be charged			0
" you now have some witnesses who the majority of this grand jury are going to better relate to			0
i hate to say it , but that 's the reality of it , and that 's why it 's a game changer to me , " @entity36 said			1
it shows their reactions shortly after the shooting			2
lots of people have come forward with their accounts of what happened the day @entity19 shot @entity2			2
but it 's significant to have the immediate reactions of two witnesses on tape , said @entity9 senior legal analyst @entity64			1
in the video , one of the construction workers raises his arms in the air -- just as , the contractor says , @entity2 was doing when he was shot			1
" you have practically in real time someone discussing what they saw , and that 's just good evidence , " @entity64 said			2
their observations echo other witness descriptions			0
some witnesses say the teenager assaulted the white officer at the outset and tried to grab his gun ; other witnesses say @entity19 was the aggressor			0
this is n't the first time we 've heard witnesses say @entity2 's hands were up			1
when eyewitnesses ' accounts coincide , that 's a key part of building a case for prosecutors , said @entity98 , a @entity9 legal analyst and former federal prosecutor			1
" they 're saying that he was running from the police officer and that his hands were up , " she said			0
" i do n't know what other witness testimony at this point or account we have to hear			0
the bottom line is having your hands up is the universal sign for surrender			0
" but she criticized claims that the testimony of white witnesses from outside the community would be more valuable			0
" five other witnesses from the community said the exact same thing , and it is befuddling to me how with these two witnesses , suddenly this is a game changer , " she said			1
analysts also gave several reasons to be skeptical the video will have much of an impact : 1			1
the witnesses did n't see how it all started			0
the men depicted in the video , who asked not to be identified after @entity9 contacted them , say they were standing about 50 feet away from @entity2 and @entity19			1
they say they could n't see how the altercation between the teenager and the police officer began			0
" you have to look at where they 're standing , " said @entity136 , general counsel for the @entity137			0
the angle the video was shot from is important , he said , adding that it seemed like the witnesses were more like 100 feet away from the shooting			1
" they could n't have seen everything , " he said			0
there 's a lot more evidence we have n't seen			2
officials have said it could take months for the grand jury to review all the evidence in the controversial case			2
and there 's a lot of things that could shape the direction the case takes , @entity36 said , such as @entity19 's initial account immediately after the shooting and forensic investigations about where the shell casings from his gun fell			2
" somebody 's going to go through and do a detailed analysis of all that , " @entity36 said			0
it does n't show the shooting			0
even though it 's valuable to see the aftermath , the video does n't show the shooting itself			2
if @entity19 's charged , that could give his defense an opening , @entity36 said			0
an attorney for the man who filmed the video told @entity9 he started recording about 40 seconds after the shooting			2
the video shows an officer putting up crime scene tape -- a sign , @entity136 says , that it could have been made " well after the shooting			1
" " what you have is a conversation that 's occurring after the fact , " he says			0
