-- president @entity1 has had the weight of the free world on his shoulders for 2Â½ years , and he might be starting to look like it			1
at 50 , which he turns thursday , his hair is a little grayer , and his face and neck are a little more creased , than on the day he took office in january 2009			1
you 'd expect some of that -- he is older			0
but @entity1 , like his predecessors , has had plenty to do			1
he 's waged battles over economic stimulus , health care and the debt ceiling			0
he 's juggled wars in @entity22 and @entity23 ; he committed to a campaign over @entity26 's skies ; he chased @entity27 ; and he dealt with a massive oil disaster off the @entity29			0
@entity1 's 50th birthday bash it 's tempting to think the office makes presidents look older than they are			1
the @entity34 who left office in 2009 was not the youthful @entity34 before 9/11			1
@entity37 's hair was significantly whiter and his eyes baggier after eight years			0
dr. @entity39 holds on to what he 's said for a while : that presidents effectively age twice as fast while in office			1
@entity39 , a chief wellness officer at the @entity44 and co-founder of @entity46 , said he based his opinion on his research of medical records of previous presidents , back to @entity51			1
examining factors such as lifestyle habits , diet , blood pressure and physical activity , he said a person who has been president eight years has the risk of disability or dying of someone who is 16 years older			1
got ta watch : @entity63 , mr. president " the main cause is what we call unrequited stress -- they do n't have enough friends to mitigate the stress , " @entity39 , who also co-authored " you : the @entity73 " with dr. @entity74 , said wednesday			1
" the major way most of us handle stress is through a number of techniques , but the most prominent way is to discuss it with friends			2
" @entity39 added , " the problem with presidents is , some of them lose friends , and the closest friend they have is usually the spouse			2
look at what ( @entity1 ) has been under with the debt ceiling			1
even his friends spoke ill of him			0
" read more on what @entity39 says about presidential aging @entity39 , who also wrote " realage : are you as @entity99 as you can be ? " said he has n't calculated @entity1 's " real age , " because of a lack of medial records			1
but records released in 2009 and 2010 show he effectively aged two years in one , in part because of his cholesterol values , he said			1
not everyone who studies aging believes the office accelerates age appearance or risk of death			1
@entity110 , who holds the @entity112 chair at the @entity114 's @entity113 , said research shows leaders in control of circumstances are less negatively affected by stress than people with less control over their environment -- such as poorer people and those with low - status jobs			2
@entity110 said presidents certainly face tons of stress , but they 're also likely to be people who thrive on it , and who have subordinates to help them manage stress			1
she also said presidents are high - status people who 've lived generally healthy lives before they became president			1
" @entity1 is a smoker ... and it 's going to cost him			2
but aside from that , he 's a skinny man who went to @entity137 and @entity138 , " she said , arguing he benefits healthwise from his upbringing and status			0
and she said presidents generally exceed the life expectancy of their cohorts			0
@entity147 made it to 93 ( although with @entity149 's )			0
" they 're the cream of the socioeconomic crop			0
generally they 've had pretty good lives and already made it to a fairly old age , so they 're going to live relatively long almost by definition , " @entity110 said			0
not so fast , said dr. @entity160 , director of the @entity161 at the @entity162			0
@entity160 , whose center studies how the mind and body influence each other , said it 's " unequivocal that significant life stress perceived by a person does accelerate aging			1
" both aging and stress produce similar stages in inflammation , the biological pathway that contributes to age - related diseases such as cardiovascular disease , dementia and some cancers , he said			1
" a person under significant stress is essentially accelerating the aging process at a biological level , and also at a genetic level , " @entity160 said			1
" it 's activating the genes that drive inflammation			0
" research by molecular biologist @entity188 also has shown that as people age , telomeres -- areas at the end of chromosomes -- shorten , and that this shortening along with inflammation is " highly predictive of death , " @entity160 said			2
" stress also produces accelerated shortening of telomeres , " @entity160 said			0
" if we look at a middle - aged person who is not under stress , compared to a ( similar ) person who has been under five years of stress , we 'd find an increase in inflammation and a shortening of these telomeres in the second person			2
both changes are indicative of increased risk of death , " @entity160 said			2
and stress can induce changes in appearance such as creased faces , @entity160 and @entity39 said			2
@entity160 said presidents do have advantages -- generally they 're brought up in a good environment and healthy way			0
presidents and everyone else can dampen the effects of stress with good lifestyle practices , strong social circles and proper sleep patterns , @entity160 said			2
and some effects of accelerated aging -- beyond those that have changed certain physical appearances and caused permanent structural damage -- are reversible , @entity39 said			0
" the good news for presidents is , like everyone else , it 's reversible if you change your habits , " @entity39 said			0
and , presumably , lessen that stress			0
@entity0 's @entity235 contributed to this report .			0
