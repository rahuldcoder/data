editor 's note : @entity2 is deputy editor for the @entity3			1
before joining the newspaper , she was a senior adviser for the @entity5 and was named a public affairs director in the @entity7 by president @entity8			0
@entity2 says @entity13 's " nation of cowards " comment struck the wrong tone			1
@entity14 ( @entity15 ) -- first , we 're a nation of whiners ; now , we 're a nation of cowards			1
the coward comment comes from none other than president @entity24 's newly minted attorney general , @entity13			1
the remarks were part of a speech @entity13 delivered for @entity28			2
yet , even in that context , the words came across as arrogant , condescending and not at all becoming a statesman			0
one dictionary definition of coward is " lacking courage			0
" stinging words for a country at war , where white and black soldiers are shedding the same color blood			2
are they cowards ? ironic too that @entity13 's remarks come at a time when the nation has just elected its first black president and witnessed the confirmation of its first black attorney general ( @entity13 himself )			1
forget that more whites than blacks cast their ballots for a black man to lead the nation			2
so this is how @entity13 says thanks ? did the attorney general not think about the weight his words would carry ? was he simply trying to be provocative ? is this his way of bringing the races together ? does his position or his color give him the bravado to think that he can get away with calling us cowards ? imagine for a moment if @entity65 or @entity8 uttered those words			1
the criticism would have known no bounds			0
i - report.com : share your thoughts on @entity13 's comments you 'll recall , it was just a few months back that a media frenzy erupted when former sen. @entity75 called national leaders ( not the nation ) a bunch of " whiners			1
" media pundits and broadcasters blasted @entity75 for weeks , until he was forced off @entity65 's campaign			0
@entity75 's words , while true , were mild in comparison to @entity13 's			1
where is that same outrage and moral condemnation over @entity13 's loose lips ? it 's a rhetorical question , of course			1
and as much as we are constantly reminded of the past " mistakes " this country has made , is there nothing worth celebrating , no times when racial harmony brought racial reconciliation ? @entity99 of that made it to @entity13 's speech			1
instead , he chose the celebratory occasion to exact punishment by way of guilt			0
it makes one wonder , why does every race speech by those on the left have to begin ( and end ) with repudiation and insult ? why must there be a constant reminder of what went wrong without giving due recognition to what went right ? i will acknowledge that the country can always do better when it comes to race , but as much as @entity123 are accused of refusing to admit racism exists , assuredly @entity125 exploit it for every inch of territory they can garner			0
they point fingers , threaten and name - call without offering real solutions or substantive conversation			0
one regular reader of the @entity3 , a @entity135 , forwarded me a letter he sent to @entity13 , telling the attorney general how much he " applauds " his remarks but saying he had one request : " i would like to recommend that your office take the lead in ensuring the appointment of at least one @entity143 on every committee and task force that is created by the @entity146 and current cabinet secretary 's			1
" how 's that for affirmative action on demand ? more like affirmative extortion			0
the writer also stated in closing : " let us ( by " us , " he means black folks ) take advantage of every opportunity that is before us			0
" i was particularly struck by the words " take advantage			0
" it is a line of thinking and supposed reasoning to justify black @entity166 getting what 's " due			1
" this was just one person 's opinion , but it reflects a sentiment shared by many liberals			0
it also reveals a get - it - all - while - you - can mentality that has nothing to do with parity , equality or justice but rather with guilt trips , paybacks and quotas			0
this is not how the " case for race " should be made			0
to be fair , there are some points @entity13 made with which i do agree ( at least in part )			2
" we , average @entity166 , simply do not talk enough with each other about race , " @entity13 stated			1
it is a challenge for each of us , black , white , @entity196 , @entity197 , to go outside our comfort zone and reach out to someone " different " from ourselves ( though i 've done it my whole life )			0
it is an observation that , while true , should n't just apply to white people			0
it applies to black folks , too			0
yet that 's where the discussion of race loses traction among liberals			0
@entity13 does n't really want to " talk " about race , because that would entail not only encouraging blacks to reach out , but it would mean addressing black racism -- which we 've seen in the likes of one rev. @entity219 -- in addition to white racism ( and all racism )			1
yes , we are sometimes too " socially segregated , " as @entity13 put it , but cowards we are not			2
and mere rhetoric and rancor does nothing to elevate the discussion			0
in contrast to @entity13 's bombastic speech , president @entity8 's @entity28 speech last year was refreshingly retrospective without being pretentious			1
while condemning present - day acts of racism ( i.e. hanging nooses ) , @entity8 also offered a way forward			0
" we renew our commitment to securing liberty and justice for every @entity166 , " @entity8 said , focusing on the present instead of the past : " we honor four @entity166 who ... are leading the way toward ending racial injustice across our land			2
" rhetoric aside , what was lacking from @entity13 's remarks was a way forward			1
instead of " hope , " @entity13 offered more hate veiled in subtle anger			1
last year , @entity24 gave a famous speech on race , addressing the controversy about the remarks of his former pastor , @entity219 , and urging people not to wallow in resentment : @entity24 said , " the profound mistake of @entity219 's sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society			1
it 's that he spoke as if our society was static , as if no progress had been made , as if this country -- a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black , @entity269 and @entity197 , rich and poor , young and old -- is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past			2
" @entity24 's speech sums it all up			2
@entity13 's is a contradiction			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity13 's remark that we 're a " nation of cowards " was wrong
she says he ignores the millions of votes @entity24 got from white *voters*
instead of hope , she says , @entity13 offered anger and resentment
@entity24 has urged @entity166 to focus on the racial progress that 's occurred
