@entity0 -- @entity0 mayor @entity2 on tuesday fired back at the president of @entity4 and others who have suggested city police went too far in their surveillance of @entity8			1
" we have to keep this country safe , " the mayor told reporters , addressing questions about an @entity12 report that said the @entity13 was closely monitoring @entity8 student associations in schools across the @entity16			1
" if people put things on websites and make them available to everybody , of course the @entity13 is going to look at anything that 's publicly available in the public domain , " @entity2 said			1
" and given we 've had a dozen people arrested or convicted of terrorist acts who 've come from similar organizations , we have an obligation to do so			0
" the @entity12 article said police have tracked websites , and on one occasion sent an undercover officer with students from @entity36 on a whitewater rafting trip			2
" the police department goes where there are allegations , " the mayor said , adding that the city 's officers are seeking to protect " the very things that allow @entity4 to survive			1
" but @entity4 president @entity46 described @entity0 's surveillance program as " antithetical to the values " of the @entity49 , @entity50 , university and those of the nation			1
when asked by a reporter if police had gone too far by sending the agent on the rafting trip , @entity2 responded " no. " @entity59 spokesman @entity58 told @entity1 that his agency does not monitor students directly , but confirmed it does monitor the websites they use			2
" in any case where you see an @entity13 officer present , it 's an indication that we were looking at an individual , " he said			0
@entity70 accused the @entity12 of " hyping these stories " to sensationalize them			2
he provided a list of 12 people arrested or convicted on terrorism - related charges in the @entity16 who were once members of @entity8 student associations			0
the @entity78 condemned the police practice in a statement tuesday			0
" we are concerned that news reports about @entity13 's presence on our campus have a chilling effect on the intellectual freedom necessary for a vibrant academic community , " it read			0
in december , a prominent group of @entity8 leaders boycotted @entity92 's annual interfaith breakfast in protest of the controversial program			1
the move stemmed from a series of earlier news reports that raised questions about the nature of a @entity101 partnership with the @entity13 that allegedly helped to build city intelligence programs to spy on @entity8			0
the boycott stood in a stark contrast to the goodwill the mayor earned among @entity8 leaders when he defended plans for a controversial @entity109 community center near the former site of the @entity111 in @entity112			2
the @entity101 later announced its internal watchdog found no issue or evidence of wrongdoing in the spy agency 's partnership with the @entity13 .			0
