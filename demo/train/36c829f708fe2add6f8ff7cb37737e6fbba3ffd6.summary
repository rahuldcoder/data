-- a veteran @entity2 human rights activist has warned that @entity3 , a mother of two , could be stoned to death at any moment under the terms of a death sentence handed down by @entity2 authorities			1
only an international campaign designed to pressure the regime in @entity11 can save her life , according to @entity13 , head of the @entity14 and the @entity15			1
" legally it 's all over , " @entity13 said sunday			2
" it 's a done deal			2
@entity3 can be stoned at any minute			2
" " that is why we have decided to start a very broad , international public movement			1
" @entity3 , 42 , will be buried up to her chest , according to an @entity24 report citing the @entity2 penal code			2
the stones that will be hurled at her will be large enough to cause pain but not so large as to kill her immediately			2
@entity3 , who is from the northern city of @entity30 , was convicted of adultery in 2006			1
she was forced to confess after being subjected to 99 lashes , human rights lawyer @entity32 said thursday in a telephone interview from @entity11			1
she later retracted that confession and has denied wrongdoing			0
her conviction was based not on evidence but on the determination of three out of five judges , @entity32 said			0
she has asked forgiveness from the court but the judges refused to grant clemency			0
@entity2 's supreme court upheld the conviction in 2007			0
@entity32 believes a language barrier prevented his client from fully comprehending court proceedings			0
@entity3 is of @entity51 descent and speaks @entity52 , not @entity53			0
the circumstances of @entity3 's case make it not an exception but the rule in @entity2 , according to @entity24 , which tracks death penalty cases around the world			1
" the majority of those sentenced to death by stoning are women , who suffer disproportionately from such punishment , " the human rights group said in a 2008 report			1
on wednesday , @entity24 made a new call to the @entity2 government to immediately halt all executions and commute all death sentences			1
the group has recorded 126 executions in @entity2 from the start of this year to june 6			0
" the organization is also urging the authorities to review and repeal death penalty laws , to disclose full details of all death sentences and executions and to join the growing international trend towards abolition , " the statement said			1
@entity13 , who fled @entity2 in the early 1980s , told @entity0 that pressure from @entity24 and other organizations and individuals is likely the only way to save @entity3			1
" experience shows ( that ) ... when the pressure gets very high , the @entity91 government starts to say something different , " she said			2
in @entity94 , the @entity93 has criticized the scheduled stoning , saying it raised serious concerns about human rights violations by the @entity2 government			1
" we have grave concerns that the punishment does not fit the alleged crime , " assistant secretary of state @entity98 said thursday			0
" for a modern society such as @entity2 , we think this raises significant human rights concerns			1
" calling @entity2 's judicial system " disproportionate " in its treatment of women , @entity98 said , " from the @entity110 ' standpoint , we do n't think putting women to death for adultery is an appropriate punishment			1
" human rights activists have been pushing the @entity91 government to abolish stoning , arguing that women are not treated equally before the law in @entity2 and are especially vulnerable in the judicial system			1
a woman 's testimony is worth half that of a man , they say			0
article 74 of the @entity2 penal code requires at least four witnesses -- four men or three men and two women -- for an adulterer to receive a stoning sentence , said @entity13 , of the @entity131			0
but there were no witnesses in @entity3 's case			0
often , said @entity13 , husbands turn wives in to get out of a marriage			0
@entity32 said he could not understand how such a savage method of death could exist in the year 2010 or how an innocent woman could be taken from her son and daughter , who have written to the court pleading for their mother 's life			1
the public wo n't be allowed to witness the stoning , @entity32 said , for fear of condemnation of such a brutal method			2
he is hoping there wo n't be an execution			0
@entity32 , who himself did jail time in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections in june 2009 , said he realizes the risk of speaking out for @entity3 , for fighting for human rights			1
but he does n't let that deter him			0
he last saw @entity3 five months ago behind bars in @entity30			0
since then , he said , he has been searching for a way to save her from the stones			2
@entity0 's @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
