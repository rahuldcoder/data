-- for incoming prime minister @entity3 , securing @entity2 's energy needs over the next decade ranks among his greatest challenges and one that will likely see him both compete and cooperate with @entity6 , the @entity7 and @entity8			1
these three are the world 's biggest energy consumers , with @entity2 in fourth spot			1
for all of them , energy security is a constant goal , driving their search for new resources , new technology and new investment opportunities around the globe			0
the @entity7 has its shale bonanza , while @entity6 has led the way with an aggressive array of international deals , covering everything from shale gas in @entity27 , pipelines across @entity32 , stakes in @entity8 liquefied natural gas ( @entity28 ) projects and @entity35 oil and gas			0
@entity2 has been able to secure coal assets in @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , and some good oil and gas assets in the @entity42 and the @entity43			0
but @entity6 companies such as @entity45 ( @entity45 ) have had the muscle and the money to outbid @entity2 rival @entity49 ( @entity49 ) for some of the most prospective oil and gas opportunities			2
in energy infrastructure such as international pipelines , @entity6 is way ahead of @entity2 , with a network of lines from @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity8 and @entity32 that delivers a steady supply of oil and gas			1
how @entity3 handles @entity2 's energy situation and the relationships he forges with @entity8 , @entity6 and the @entity7 may well define his administration			1
keeping up with demand according to the @entity67 's latest @entity66 , @entity2 will overtake @entity6 in the 2020s as the principal source of growth in global energy demand			1
by 2025 @entity2 will be the world 's biggest coal importer			0
@entity3 prides himself that electricity is always on in his home state of @entity76 , where large coal - fired power stations run by groups such as @entity79 and @entity80 help deliver a surplus of power			0
that is certainly not the case for many other parts of the country -- more than 300 million people lack access to electricity , and a massive outage in july 2012 saw another 600 million across the northern , eastern and central parts of @entity2 lose power for two days			0
there are constant problems with energy infrastructure , ranging from the stability of the grid to supply - demand imbalances and illegal connections			0
@entity3 's @entity100 ( @entity100 ) identifies energy as a " national security issue " in its policy manifesto , and says economic growth must not be " negatively impacted " by energy supply issues			1
if @entity3 is to achieve his goal of every @entity2 citizen having access to a house with water and power by 2022 - 23 , then energy security becomes of paramount importance			1
the role of renewables such as solar and wind is expected to grow in @entity2 's energy mix , but coal will remain the backbone of power generation until at least 2025 , supported by oil and gas , hydro and nuclear power			1
even with extensive coal deposits at home -- state - owned @entity128 is the world 's single biggest coal producer with an output of 462 million metric tons in the financial year that ended on march 31 -- @entity2 's domestic energy sources run well below demand			1
that means it must import thermal coal from suppliers such as @entity38 and @entity39 , oil and gas from the @entity42 and @entity40 , and uranium from @entity8 , @entity141 and @entity59			0
by the end of this decade , lng from @entity27 will enter @entity2 's supply equation			1
divide and conquer diversity of fuel types and suppliers is a key part of @entity3 's energy security platform , which is why he wants to explore options such as a gas pipeline from @entity8			1
there is a long - standing proposal to bring in gas from the @entity155 nation of @entity58 through a pipeline that would cross @entity157 and @entity158			0
this is the @entity160 pipeline , which has been on the books for almost 20 years but has been stalled by the geopolitics of @entity2 - @entity157 hostility and the long - running conflict in @entity158			0
another proposed pipeline from @entity166 to @entity2 would also have to cross @entity157 , rendering both projects problematic for now			0
that makes a @entity8 pipeline running through its @entity170 into northwest @entity6 and then to northern @entity2 a possibility , albeit a costly one			2
during their annual summit in @entity177 last october , @entity8 president @entity173 and @entity3 's prime ministerial predecessor @entity174 agreed to delve further into land - based hydrocarbon supply options such as the pipeline			1
@entity3 says @entity2 - @entity8 relations have stood the test of time , and he wants to further strengthen them , which suggests that @entity2 may be keen to buy more @entity8 oil and gas in future			2
@entity189 and delivery options will be the usual sticking points			0
@entity3 says @entity6 is a country he can do business with , but energy competition between the two is likely to remain high			2
@entity2 is partnering with @entity194 to explore for oil in the same @entity197 waters where @entity6 's recent oil rig movements have brought @entity6 - @entity194 relations to an unhappy low			2
for its part , @entity6 says it is willing to make joint efforts with the new @entity2 government and " bring the @entity6 - @entity2 strategic partnership to a new height			0
" @entity2 - @entity7 relations should improve under @entity3 's pro-business outlook			2
his " minimum government , maximum governance " approach resonates with president @entity211 , who has already invited @entity3 to visit the @entity7 domestic supply @entity2 companies such as @entity215 's @entity214 and state - run gas utility @entity216 have invested in the @entity7 shale sector to gain exposure to the new technologies being used there			1
some of this may be translated back to @entity2 's nascent shale gas sector , where recent estimates by the @entity225 suggest @entity2 has 2.7 trillion cubic meters ( tcm ) of risked , technically recoverable resources			2
in comparison , the @entity7 has 33 tcm and @entity6 31.5 tcm			0
@entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity38 also have potentially large fields , as do @entity8 , @entity236 and @entity40			0
the reality is that the hydraulic fracturing or " fracking " technique used to unlock shale reserves is highly water - intensive , meaning that @entity2 's chronic water shortage will have a big bearing on how many shale fields are developed			2
still , @entity3 's policy is clear : @entity2 will not put all its energy eggs in one basket , and developing its domestic supply capacity is a priority .			1

how @entity2 's new *pm* handles the nation 's energy may define his administration , says @entity255
@entity3 is likely to compete and cooperate with other major energy consumers
@entity2 is expected to overtake @entity6 as the main source of growth in global energy demand
developing @entity2 's domestic supply capacity is a priority for the prime minister
