-- the @entity1 finally claimed a gold medal in figure skating ice dance as @entity4 and @entity5 produced a stunning world record display in @entity7 on the tenth day of action			1
having taken team bronze on day two of the @entity11 , and a silver in @entity13 four years ago , @entity9 and @entity5 saved the best for last as they completed their @entity16 medal set			1
the two - time world champions scored 116.63 points for their free skate , to @entity21 's ' @entity20 ' , which created an overall total of 195.52 when added to their record display in the short dance on sunday			1
" we 're so excited we 're kind of in shock a little			0
i 'm not sure what we 're feeling			0
we 're kind of in disbelief , " @entity9 , 27 , told reporters afterwards			2
" i 've never skated and visualized the performance at the same time and tonight that 's kind of how it felt			2
" the @entity1 had won 14 figure skating gold medals before , all of which came in either the men 's or women 's singles			1
" 17 years of hard work was justified , " said @entity5 , 26 , referring to the fact that he first started skating with @entity9 as a child			1
" to come away with a gold medal is amazing			0
" " we were well prepared by our coach @entity46 ( @entity47 ) in coming here and doing our job			0
i felt like we had done everything we could from the beginning of this competition -- in practice , team event , this event			1
" rather unusually , the @entity1 duo have the same coach -- @entity59 - born @entity58 -- as the @entity61 couple who took silver : 2010 @entity16 champions @entity64 and @entity65			1
the quartet even train together in @entity67			0
" that was our best performance of the year for that program , " said @entity65			0
" we do n't know what our plans are for the future from an amateur standpoint			0
we know we 're doing ' @entity74 ' in the spring ! " to the delight of an enraptured home crowd , @entity59 's @entity76 and @entity77 -- who had already won gold in the team event at @entity7 -- won bronze at the @entity81			1
myth busters yet the host nation was not to be denied in the bobsleigh as @entity85 and @entity7 - born @entity86 took a historic gold , @entity59 's first at the @entity88			1
having regularly trained in @entity7 , the pair set a track record of 56.08 in their third run -- and @entity85 was delighted to have also beaten a different kind of record			2
for the pilot disproved local belief that whoever carries the flag in the opening ceremony does not win a medal			0
" now you see it 's just superstition , " said the @entity59 team 's flag bearer from ten days ago			1
@entity105 took silver in the race , while @entity108 and @entity109 became the first pair from the @entity1 to win a medal in the two - man competition since 1952			1
" when we do well in two - man , we typically do well in four - man , " said @entity108 , who took gold in the four - man four years ago			2
" the medals for the four - man bobsleigh will be decided on sunday , ahead of the closing ceremony later that night			0
meanwhile , @entity123 duo @entity122 and @entity124 failed to make it into the top 20 of the two - man event and went out after the third run			0
double delight for belarus in many ways , the day belonged to @entity131 -- a country of less than 10 million inhabitants that is lying seventh on the medals table , albeit with the same number of golds ( five ) as second - placed @entity59			1
three of these have gone to the woman who is now the most successful olympian in @entity131 ' history , with @entity142 having also won a bronze in @entity13 2010			2
having triumphed in the 10 km pursuit and the 15 km individual , @entity142 blitzed the field in the women 's 12.5 km mass start as well -- spending over half the race skiing alone after opening up a healthy lead by the second lap. she finished 20 seconds ahead of @entity154 's @entity153 , with @entity155 of @entity156 taking bronze			1
" it 's amazing to be here because i dreamed about it , to be an @entity16 champion , from my childhood			0
but to get three - dreams do come true , " said the 27 - year - old @entity142			0
" @entity59 family , @entity165 family			2
all these nations , @entity59 , @entity167 , we are like brothers and sisters			2
for me , i feel this country is really native for me			0
" @entity172 , meanwhile , emulated the feats of her mother , who won a silver medal in cross country at the @entity179 in @entity180			0
" it is one of the best moments of my life , " the 24 - year - old told reporters			0
" it 's a really big pleasure to win silver here			2
i hope my mum is happy that i am as successful as her			0
" there was a double celebration for @entity131 as @entity191 ensured that his nation took gold in both the men 's and women 's freestyle skiing , after compatriot @entity199 's triumph on friday			1
@entity131 has a proud record in aerials , having won a medal in the men 's competition five times in a row while their total tally of three golds is superior to any other nation			1
their twin success in @entity7 is only the second time that one nation has won both the men 's and women 's events , with the @entity1 previously achieving the feat in 1998			1
@entity191 's jump in the ' super final ' was as supreme in its execution as it was in its ambition and he said he took extra incentive from having his family , including his two - year - old son , watch him in @entity7			2
" i am so happy that they came here			0
it is so great that when i see them i can jump longer and with more power , " he said			0
" five gold medals is so great for us and all of our country			0
" @entity231 took a shock silver as @entity233 won its first medal in the men 's event , with @entity237 winning bronze for @entity239			2
table toppers the fifth and final gold medal of the day went to @entity243 's ski jumpers in the men 's team event			1
the @entity243 managed to end an incredible winning streak in the event , with @entity248 not only having won gold in the last two @entity88 but also failing to lose a team large hill event since 2005			1
they had to settle for silver , while @entity254 finished third			0
@entity243 's success took them to seven golds , two more than their nearest rivals at the top of the medals table			1
in other action on monday , the @entity1 and @entity61 beat @entity262 and @entity263 respectively to set up their fourth meeting in the final in five @entity88			1
originally earmarked for monday morning , the men 's 15 km mass start biathlon final and snowboard cross qualification were postponed to tuesday because of thick fog .			0
