-- after 13 - year - old @entity2 had a tonsillectomy , she suffered cardiac arrest and loss of blood flow to her brain			1
her doctors pronounced her " brain dead			1
" but what happened next tragically exposed the challenges and confusion in @entity14 medicine over defining death			1
is it when the brain stops functioning , or when circulation stops ? by @entity22 law , if the brain is dead , the person is dead			1
according to the law in all @entity14 jurisdictions , it does n't matter how death is measured			2
doctors who persist in calling patients " brain dead " are asking for trouble			1
these doctors have gotten it			0
@entity2 is on a ventilator			1
her parents wanted a second opinion on whether she met the standard tests for the death of the brain			1
after the second physician confirmed that the criteria were met , the normal next step would have been to pronounce her dead and stop ventilation			2
but her parents continued to fight , and another extension on turning off her machines was granted			0
they are scrambling to move her to a facility that will treat her before the court - imposed deadline of january 7			0
now the family of @entity51 has joined the battle			0
@entity51 's case was another high - profile example of the devastation that happens when there are differences on whether someone is alive and whether to keep that person on support			1
@entity51 , who was not brain - dead but was severely brain damaged , died in 2005 after her feeding tube was disconnected			1
her parents fought for years to keep her alive against her wishes , as expressed by her husband			0
the standard tests for the death of the brain are fairly straightforward			1
it is not a vegetative state -- it is absence of brain activity , and constitutes a legal measure of death in all states			2
and no law prohibits continued ventilation of a dead body			0
we do it routinely to preserve organs for transplant			0
@entity2 's parents have decided to try to continue ventilation -- if you call it life - support you are taking a stand on whether she is dead -- so the issues become who will provide the treatment and who will pay			1
a significant minority in the medical profession continue to believe people with dead brains and beating hearts are still alive			0
believers include some of our wisest minds -- a @entity101 professor , an @entity103 theorist , a chief of neurology at @entity106 , and the former chair of the @entity14 president 's @entity108 all reject brain - based death pronouncement			1
they agree with @entity2 's parents that death is linked to circulatory loss			1
others take a position more liberal than the standard law that defines brain death			2
they favor pronouncing death in some cases even when some parts of the lower brain are still functioning			2
i have defended that view since 1973			0
why , then , does @entity14 law continue to force one standard of death on @entity2 's parents and others who have plausible alternative definitions ? once one realizes that the choice among the options is not a cut - and - dried matter of medical science , why not let people have some choice based on their personal religious and cultural views ? this is a " conscience - based " approach to defining death			1
we need to have a default public policy -- the brain - based definition currently in law -- but people like @entity2 's parents should have the option to record their conscientiously held positions and allow pronouncements of death to be based on those beliefs			1
that 's the law in @entity151 and @entity152			0
that would mean @entity2 could be classified as alive if that is what her parents choose			1
that , of course , does n't end the controversy			0
just like it is not illegal to provide medical support for dead people , it is not necessarily illegal to stop life - support on someone who is still alive			2
we do that every day , particularly for those who are permanently unconscious			0
the trouble arises when physicians want to stop life - support , perhaps because they believe the case is hopeless , and the patient or family insist that life support continue			0
we call this the " futile care problem			0
" i defended in court the mother of a severely brain - damaged baby referred to as @entity180 who wanted life support to continue even though her doctors wanted to stop			2
@entity183 should show sympathy for mothers who want their children to be kept alive			0
if preserving life requires high - tech support like a ventilator , doctors are the ones who should provide it			2
the costs should n't be borne by the hospital			0
the health insurance company or @entity197 should n't pay			0
but if the family can raise the funds , like @entity2 's parents are doing , and the patient is beyond feeling pain , no harm is done by continuing , especially if they can find a facility willing to take the case			1
whether this right to medical support should extend to those considered dead by one standard , but alive by another is the question we face with @entity2			1
if the patient does not suffer , and private funding is available , people should have the right to make this decision for their loved ones			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			2

@entity2 has been *declared* brain dead but parents want her to remain on ventilator
@entity219 : some define death when brain stops , some say it 's when circulation stops
**veatch** : tragedy shows the confusion around defining death ; we need a public policy
**veatch** : parents should be able to keep her on support if it can be privately funded
