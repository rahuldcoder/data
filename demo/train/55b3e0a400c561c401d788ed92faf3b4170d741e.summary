-- for thirty - two years i have been actively involved in the ongoing efforts to help bring @entity4 war criminals to justice -- and the most common question i am asked concerns the age of the perpetrators			1
is it still worthwhile to prosecute elderly @entity12 perpetrators ? personally , i never doubted the validity of these efforts , but because the question is understandable and deserves a serious answer , i want to present the case for continued prosecution			1
firstly , the passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of those who participated in the @entity12			2
had these criminals been prosecuted decades ago , when they were far younger , the importance of the effort to bring them to justice would not have been questioned			1
they are just as guilty today as the day they committed their crime -- and they do not deserve a prize for eluding justice for so long			0
@entity30 seeks to prosecute former @entity4 camp guard living in @entity32 second , old age should not grant protection to murderers			1
reaching the age of 85 or 90 does not turn a mass murderer into a @entity38			0
the only issue of concern is a person 's mental and physical health			0
there is no reason to ignore someone 's crimes simply because they were born in 1915 -- as was @entity48 , who at least until recently was still driving his car			0
third , every victim of the @entity51 deserves that an effort be made to find the person ( s ) who turned them -- innocent men , women and children -- into victims , simply because they were classified as " enemies of the @entity4			1
" ignoring any of the perpetrators simply because of age would be a betrayal of their victims			0
the continuing pursuit of @entity4 war criminals sends a powerful message about the importance of holding genocidists accountable			1
if we want to prevent future crimes of the scope of the @entity12 , it has to be crystal - clear that persons who commit such crimes will almost certainly be caught and punished			2
unfortunately , that has not been the case for all those who committed @entity12 crimes -- a reality which made tragedies like @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 much more possible			2
lastly , the trials of @entity4 war criminals and collaborators are a very powerful tool in the ongoing fight against @entity12 denial and distortion			1
they are an important addition to the existing documentation of the mass murders and emphasize the necessity of identifying those responsible			0
in that respect , the significance of the @entity12 , or the @entity12 , and the reason its lessons are so crucial for mankind is that it was not an earthquake , tsunami or volcano , but rather a manmade tragedy carried out by human beings against their fellow humans			2
there are two other elements that often surface in discussing the continued prosecution of @entity4 war criminals			1
the first concerns the issue of " superior orders " and the second relates to the question of regret			0
the cartoonist who kickstarted career in @entity30 pow camp ever since the @entity125 , international law -- created in the wake of @entity124 and the @entity12 -- has rejected the alibi of superior orders and emphasized individual criminal responsibility , that every individual is responsible for his or her deeds , and must bear the consequences , even if they were ordered to do so by a person with a higher rank			1
thus , @entity136 for example , was convicted of " accessory to murder " in a @entity30 court in may 2011 , for his service as an armed @entity142 guard in the @entity144 death camp , where he was part of the group which carried out the murders under the orders of their superiors			1
what of the mindset of the accused ? many people have suggested that since many years have passed since the crimes were committed , the perpetrators probably regret their misdeeds , a factor which would ostensibly weaken the rationale for prosecution			0
while there may have been a few such cases of this , i have never encountered a single regretful or remorseful one in decades of dealing with dozens of @entity4 murderers of many different nationalities , religions , occupations and walks of life			0
if anything my experience has taught me just the opposite			0
even 50 and 60 years after the events , and with so much information easily available on the @entity12 in their countries of origin and / or residence , they remain proud of the murder of so many innocent @entity181 and other enemies of the @entity4			2
the views expressed in this piece are solely those of dr. @entity185 .			0
