@entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 -- a year ago , historians held their breath as archaeologist @entity6 painstakingly dusted centuries of dirt and debris from the curved spine and staved - in skull of a skeleton uncovered under a parking lot in the @entity2 city of @entity1			1
the story of the long - lost king buried beneath a car park made headlines around the world -- but 12 months on , excitement has given way to anger , as enthusiasts and experts argue over what should happen to @entity27 's remains			1
the once - missing monarch -- best known as the @entity32 villain accused of murdering his nephews , the @entity28 , to take the throne -- faces one final battle before he can be left to rest in peace : the increasingly bitter fight over where his bones ( minus his feet , lost at some point during the past 500 years ) will be interred			1
the judge in the case , mr. @entity40 has even gone so far as to plead with all concerned " to avoid embarking on the ( legal ) @entity43 , part two , " warning that such legal wrangling would be " unseemly , undignified and unedifying , " and urging them to call in an independent panel of experts to rule on the burial			2
the original @entity43 was a bloody civil war which divided @entity2 for decades , and eventually saw @entity27 's family , the @entity52 , swept from power			1
while the experts who carried out the search for @entity27 's remains are keen to see him reinterred in @entity1 , others believe it was the medieval king 's wish to be buried in @entity0 -- the city they claim was closest to his heart			1
@entity2 rules and regulations governing exhumations should mean that the decision is a straightforward one -- such bodies are usually reburied in the nearest consecrated ground to the archaeological dig site -- but in fact it is proving anything but , with the launch of legal action to try and halt the plans			2

back then @entity87 , lead archaeologist on what he admits to initially thinking of as a " harebrained scheme , " told @entity3 how he had applied for a license to exhume any human remains with the words " in the unlikely event that we find the remains of @entity27			2
. " but it is this very license that now finds itself at the center of a court battle between the authorities in @entity1 and a group calling itself the @entity102 , who say more thought should have gone into the reburial			2
the @entity102 -- made up of people who claim to be distantly related to @entity27 , and headed by @entity107 , his 17th great nephew -- objects to the lack of consultation over where the newly - rediscovered king 's bones should be laid to rest			1
they say that given the remains ' royal status , it should not be a simple case of " finders keepers			0
" instead , they believe that the location of the new grave should be up for discussion			0
" what we 're saying is that for a significant historical figure such as @entity27 , his remains should be the subject of a broad consultation , " explains @entity122 , the lawyer representing the @entity102			2
" all the interested parties should be able to have their say , state their case as to where the bones should be buried ... it should n't be a closed decision			0
" read more : new coffin mystery at @entity27 site the @entity102 eventually wants to see the bones taken to @entity0 , a northern city packed to the gills with historic sites and , the group says , with links to @entity27 it is a plea backed up by others in the city			1
" @entity27 was the last northern king , " explains @entity147 , of @entity0 's @entity148			1
" he had lots of estates and he was constantly moving around , but certainly he would identify himself as northern , and @entity0 was a city that was very close to his heart ... he was very much part of the civic fabric			0
" by contrast , say the " @entity162 , " the ill - fated monarch had little or no connection to @entity1 -- other than the fact he was slung into a hastily - dug grave there following his death at the @entity161 in 1485			2
not true , say those in the @entity1 camp			0
" there 's considerable historical evidence that @entity27 spent quite a lot of time at his castle here in @entity1 , " says the city 's mayor , @entity165			1
" it was from @entity1 that he chose to ride out to what would prove to be his last battle , and it was to @entity1 that he was returned , and where he was buried on the orders of the new king , @entity177			1
" and frankly , to be buried by royal command in a city is pretty powerful evidence that this is where he ought to remain			0
" read more : is this the face that launched 1,000 myths ? @entity165 insists that the events of more recent times offer all the more reason for the monarch to be laid to rest in @entity1			0
" @entity1 's people have honored @entity27 for many generations : we have a @entity190 , a @entity27 's school , we even have pubs called after @entity27			1
" it 's not just the history that compels us -- it is also the fact that it was the amazing skill of @entity198 's archaeologists that actually rediscovered the remains , and their incredible forensic work that confirmed they were the remains of @entity27			1
" @entity1 is where he 's been for 500 years , and @entity1 is where he deserves to be reburied , with proper ceremony , and in a tomb fit for a king			1
" indeed , the city is speeding full - steam ahead with plans for a new tomb in the cathedral , where a memorial stone has long paid tribute to the last @entity102 king , and for a visitor center on the site of the @entity218 car park , telling the story of @entity27 's life , his death , and his rediscovery			1
the council has already bought an old school which is being turned into a museum , and it is clear that there is a commercial aspect to the battle for the bones , since whichever city they end up in is likely to see a tourism boost			0

it is said that the foot - fall at @entity243 has increased 20-fold since the discovery			0
" sitting in a quiet corner of the @entity246 with his wife @entity247 , waiting for a tour to begin , @entity250 local -- but @entity252 native -- @entity253 believes that 's another reason why the bones should stay close to where they were found			0
" @entity0 has oodles and oodles of tourist attractions , " he explained			0
" @entity1 does n't have many , and if it loses @entity27 , it will have one less			2
" the @entity102 , though , insist that money has nothing to do with their case			0
" my clients have no commercial interest in it , " says @entity122			0
" they wo n't gain out of any tourism , but they have a very strong view that @entity27 's links to the north of @entity2 , and to @entity0 in particular , mean that he should be buried here			1
" for @entity147 , it comes down to the question of what the king himself would have wanted			0
" as far as we can tell , as far as we have any idea of where he wanted to be buried himself , it seems to be in @entity0 , " he told @entity3			0
" there 's a sense that @entity27 is a king who has had a bad press -- an unfair bad press -- and that responding as far as we can to his known wishes would slightly even things up a bit			0
