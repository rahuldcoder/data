-- @entity1 is n't getting rid of mainstay " @entity3 , " but the network is rethinking its approach			1
that was one of the highlights of @entity1 's unveiling of its 2014 - 2015 schedule on monday , during which the network placed a spotlight on new series such as " @entity14 , " its highly publicized @entity16 prequel , and " @entity17 , " a sometimes comedic drama starring @entity20 winner @entity19			1
