" " our assistance will help stem migration flows as well as address the root cause of the migration , " the statement said			0
the @entity1 administration has accused syndicates in @entity35 of waging a deliberate campaign of misinformation that has caused people in poor @entity13 countries and @entity6 to risk their lives to head for the @entity7 , where they expect to stay			1
@entity20 press secretary @entity41 said the administration is addressing the problem in several ways			0
" we 're going to open up some additional detention facilities that can accommodate adults that show up on the border with their children			2

" some of that is an information campaign and countering this intentional misinformation campaign that 's being propagated by criminal syndicates			0

@entity72 's objective in the meeting with leaders from @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity6 was to emphasize that " children and adults arriving with their children ( in the @entity7 ) are not eligible to benefit from the passage of immigration reform legislation or from the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) process			1

the federal government does not have the processing capabilities to handle this kind of influx of illegal human traffic			0

the @entity158 and the @entity159 are also taking additional steps to try and mitigate the still unfolding immigration crisis			0
the agencies are " surging government enforcement resources to increase ( the ) capacity to detain individuals and adults who bring their children with them and to handle immigration court hearings as quickly and efficiently as possible while also while protecting those who are seeking asylum			0
" " this is an extraordinary interagency effort to deal with an urgent humanitarian situation , " said @entity170 , the @entity20 director of domestic policy , in a conference call on the new administration plan			0

" " this facility is designed for our soldiers to train and prepare to protect our nation , " said @entity179			0
" instead , the federal government is using it as a cross between a boarding school and detention center for illegal immigrants			0
president @entity1 should not be using our military facilities as a tool to cover up his failed immigration policies			0
" the @entity1 administration aims to close the @entity182 housing facility for undocumented children in the next 120 days			0
