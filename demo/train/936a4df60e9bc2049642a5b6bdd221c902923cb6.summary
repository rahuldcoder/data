-- the whole world is watching how @entity2 picks his cabinet , but he and his wife @entity4 have a much more personal choice to make at home -- and it 's very political too			1
@entity7 , left , and @entity8 will make the @entity10 home come january 20			0
when they move to @entity13 , will their daughters @entity8 , 10 , and @entity7 , 7 , go to public or private school ? for many @entity17 parents , that decision is more revealing than the ones they make at the ballot box			1
what do you think the @entity2 family should do ? @entity17 of a certain income who choose public school are demonstrating that they trust the government to educate their children			1
@entity17 who send their children to private school are saying that the government has n't earned that trust			1
in some areas , it 's also been a way for white families to avoid sending their children to school with black children			2
@entity38 tend to favor giving poor families subsidies so they can afford private schools too			0
most democrats , including @entity2 , are opposed to the idea , because they think it undermines the public school system			1
it 's not an issue every president faces			0
@entity49 's twin daughters , @entity50 and @entity51 , were both college students by the time he took office			2

this week , mrs. @entity8 took the girls to visit some of @entity13 's elite private schools , with tuition of about $ 28,000			2
in an interview with @entity84 , she resorted to the kind of careful phrasing that practiced politicians use to avoid controversy			0
" what we have asked people to understand is that the decision that we make will be based on the best interests of the girls			0
we have n't made that decision yet			0
we want that to be a personal process , and people have been really good about respecting that			1
" they ca n't avoid the decision for long			0
the @entity2 's move to @entity13 in january , just in time for the second half of the school year to begin .			1

@entity17 president - elect @entity2 takes office in @entity13 in january
much *debate* about whether @entity2 's daughters will *attend* public or private school
where parents decide to send children often indicates their views on education
@entity116 : this is a personal process , we ask that people respect that
