-- the @entity2 military said late friday it is calling off the search for bodies of passengers and crew from the @entity8 plane that crashed into the @entity9 earlier this month			1
wreckage from @entity10 spotted by search teams in the @entity9 last week			1
it was unlikely that any more bodies would be found , the military said			2
so far , search teams have found 51 of the 228 people who died when @entity10 plunged into the sea june 1 , according to the military			1
they have also found more than 600 parts and structural components of the plane , along with luggage , the military said			2
the bodies were handed to @entity2 authorities for identification while the debris and luggage were given to @entity27 aviation investigators , the military said			1
in the 26 days of the search operation , the @entity2 air force used 12 planes along with aircraft from @entity27 , the @entity32 and @entity33 , the military said			1
the @entity2 navy used 11 ships			2
ships remain in the search area hundreds of miles northeast of @entity2 in an effort to find the flight data recorders , the @entity2 military said			1
last week investigators said they were running out of time to find the recorders which could prove crucial to working out what caused the disaster			1
officials remain in the dark about what caused the airliner to plunge into the sea off the coast of @entity2			2
the wreckage is believed to be about 15,000 feet ( 4,500 meters ) deep , amid underwater mountains and mixed in with tons of sea trash			1
a @entity27 submarine and other vessels are searching for black boxes by attempting to trace their locator beacons , which send out acoustic pulses , or " pings , " to searchers			0
the @entity63 has contributed two high - tech acoustic devices -- known as towed pinger locators -- which have been attached to @entity27 tug boats and can search to a maximum depth of 20,000ft ( 6,100 meters )			0
the firm which makes the recorders , @entity68 , has told @entity0 it has a 100 percent recovery record from air accidents			0
@entity68 said it was hard to estimate how much battery life the locator beacon on the recorders had , as it depended on the conditions , but it is typically around 30 days			0
one recorder taped radio transmissions and sounds in the cockpit , such as the pilot 's voices and engine noises			0
sounds of interest could be engine noise , stall warnings , landing gear extension and retraction , and other clicks and pops			0
from these sounds engine revs per minute , system failures , speed and the time at which certain events occurred could often be determined , according to the @entity97			0
@entity0 's @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 , contributed to this report .			0
