two of my eldest son 's first words were " @entity5 " and " @entity6			1
" ( or " @entity7 , " at least			0
) that should have clued me in that @entity9 was following in his @entity11 's footsteps ; he was a superhero fan in the making			2
from dancing and singing to the " @entity6 " theme song at age 1 to creating his own super-characters from everyday items around him , he 's been completely enthralled with superheroes			1
as he grows up , his superheroes are shaping the person he 's becoming			1
a fascination with superheroes can benefit a child in many ways , including boosting his self - confidence and making him feel powerful			1
( and what better day than @entity27 , april 28 , to celebrate that ? ) @entity9 is n't the only example of the positive powers of superhero worship			2
in some cases , superheroes can teach children how to be strong			2
@entity35 of @entity36 , @entity37 , has also encouraged her son , @entity38 , to explore superheroes for years , because of the way they changed her childhood for the better			1
before she admired @entity43 and princess @entity44 , @entity35 was bullied by other kids for her first heroic inspiration , @entity47			1
" my two oldest brothers and their neighborhood friends squelched my dreams , " she said			0
" their mockery drove me to find comfort in the arms of my mother			0
" her mother encouraged her to pursue a more " daring " character , and soon she discovered @entity43 and tv 's @entity57			1
@entity43 gave her confidence : " she was powerful , beautiful and never broke a sweat ! " even today , she credits these heroes with some of the things she has accomplished in life			1
" i have completed four half - ironman races ( 70.3 miles ) in the past two years , " she said			2
" each time i envision my success , i think of the @entity57 or @entity43 , and i feel invincible			1
when i take that first stroke and glide across the water i am energized			0
" now she sees 11 - year - old @entity38 finding strength to deal with his problems at school			1
" sometimes @entity38 says that he gets bullied and superheroes give him the confidence to stand up , and tell the teacher , " she said			1
" one of his favorites is the @entity77 , " she said			0
" ' i like that @entity77 gets angry at the bad guys and he uses kung - fu ! ' " he told his mother			2
the recent " @entity83 " movie has made the patriotic hero one of @entity38 's favorites , as well			2
when asked by his mother why he likes superheroes so much , he said , " they have super powers , strength , and they are brave			1
they always do the right things			0
superheroes give you strength ! " @entity97 , social psychology professor at the @entity98 , sees this -- superheroes giving strength and power -- as the key to why kids love superheroes			1
" we adults forget how vulnerable we all were as young children , " he said			0
" we were little and lacked the physical size and strength and knowledge to protect ourselves and function effectively on our own , " he said			2
children first depend on their parents for love and protection			0
but as they grow up , they start looking to role models who embody the same power and positivity , @entity97 said			0
" by identifying with the culture 's heroes and superheroes , children can begin to feel like they are aligning with what is good and can develop their own agency , power , and value in the world , " he said			1
of course , there are always the classic arguments against kids having an interest in superheroes			2
they take children out of reality			0
superheroes come with a heaping helping of violence ( even if it 's usually " cartoon violence " )			1
and there are also concerns that boys are getting the wrong idea , seeing their future selves as either heroes or victims			0
@entity97 said these are valid concerns , but he still sees superheroes as the good guys when it comes to their influence on children			1
the answer is n't to try to control your child 's preferences			0
@entity97 encourages parents to " be a guiding force by sharing their enjoyment of superheroes , and in age appropriate ways			0
" once children understand that these are fictional characters , they can begin to distinguish between how things work in superhero land and how they work in the real world , he said			0
@entity35 said superheroes teach her son good lessons on a smaller scale : " i think he is learning that everyone is capable of being extraordinary			1
" as my son @entity9 's superhero playtime has evolved , not only has he developed a sense of morality , his inner positivity has also come out			1
he sees the villains as capable of turning over a new leaf			0
he describes them as turning good at times			0
@entity9 's fascination has not gone without some encouragement on my part			0
i have been a fan of superheroes ever since @entity185 taught me how to read on " @entity186			0
" it really never left me , from the @entity188 of the late ' 80s and early ' 90s to the resurgence of superhero cinema with " x-men " and " @entity185 , " and i 've been a comics collector off and on for decades			0
as far as i 'm concerned , i hope superheroes continue to take @entity9 's imagination up , up and away !			2
