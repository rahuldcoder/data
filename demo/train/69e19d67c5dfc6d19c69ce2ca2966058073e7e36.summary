@entity0 -- seven @entity3 presidential candidates engaged in a sometimes contentious debate tuesday in @entity5 , @entity6 , as bad blood boiled between front - runners and the surging @entity9 found his opponents taking aim at his tax plan			1
here are five things we learned from the debate : why 9 - 9 - 9 was no. 1 : a rise in the polls brings more scrutiny , so we knew that @entity9 's " 9 - 9 - 9 " tax plan would come under attack from his rivals			1
and we did n't have to wait long for the full frontal assault			0
in response to the first question of the debate , from an audience member asking the candidates their " position on replacing the federal income tax with a federal sales tax , " the other candidates were quick to pile on and rip apart @entity9 's much - touted proposal to reform the country 's tax code , a plan which has helped the former @entity40 ceo surge in the polls			1
the six other candidates sharing the stage with @entity9 fired away , terming the plan as risky and simplistic			1
" anytime you give the @entity49 a brand - new tax , it does n't go away , " said rep. @entity45 of @entity46			2
" @entity9 's well - meaning , and i love his boldness , " said former sen. @entity51 of @entity52			1
" i give him credit for -- for starting a debate , but it 's not good for families			2
" " @entity9 , i love you , brother , but let me tell you something , you do n't need to have a big analysis to figure this thing out			2
go to @entity65 , where they do n't have a sales tax , and you 're fixing to give them one , " said @entity64 gov. @entity63			1
it 's not going to fly			0
" said rep. @entity70 of @entity64			2
" it 's very , very dangerous			0
and it will raise more revenues , " said rep. @entity70 of @entity64			2
" the analysis i did , person by person , return by return , is that middle - income people see higher taxes under your plan , " said former @entity76 gov. @entity75			1
@entity9 repeatedly defended his plan , saying it would not raise taxes on poor people , and said his opponents were misrepresenting his proposal			1
" the reason that our plan is being attacked so much is because lobbyists , accountants , politicians -- they do n't want to throw out the current tax code and put in something that 's simple and fair , " responded @entity9			1
after the debate , @entity9 said he was happy with his defense of his plan , but promised a more comprehensive proposal would follow , and he added that the attacks on him are proof that he 's now a front - runner in the race for the nomination			1
@entity75 gave as good as he got : we knew @entity75 would be under the microscope , but the attacks from his fellow candidates seemed a bit more vicious in @entity5			2
call it a @entity113 shootout along the @entity114 , with @entity75 the target			2
@entity75 and @entity51 got into a shouting match over the @entity76 health care measure passed when @entity75 was governor			2
the plan , known as ' @entity119 , ' has been attacked by fellow @entity3 as the genesis for the much - hated national health care law pushed by president @entity122 and passed by a @entity123 - controlled @entity49			1
" you ca n't change the facts , " shouted @entity51			0
" @entity51 , you had your chance			0
let me speak , " fired back @entity75			2
" you 're out of time			0
you 're out of time , " responded @entity51			0
@entity75 and @entity63 were involved in another dust - up a few minutes later , with @entity63 saying on the issue of illegal immigration , " @entity75 , you lose all of your standing , from my perspective , because you hired illegals in your home and you knew about it for a year			1
and the idea that you stand here before us and talk about that you 're strong on immigration is , on its face , the height of hypocrisy			0
" a shouting match ensued , with @entity63 interrupting @entity75 and @entity75 firing back " @entity51 , again , @entity51 again , i 'm speaking , " and adding this zinger : " this has been a tough couple of debates for @entity51 , and i understand that			1
and so you 're going to get testy			0
" @entity75 gave as good as he got , but the fact that " @entity119 " keeps coming up must be frustrating for him and a concern for his campaign			2
@entity155 more impressed with @entity3 field after debate @entity63 finally woke up : @entity63 's poor debate performances over the past month are a major reason why he 's faded in national polling			1
the @entity5 debate may be the moment when he started to turn things around			0
one thing 's for sure , @entity63 's still got plenty of fight left in him			1
@entity63 did n't even wait for the questioning to begin to start going on the attack			2
he zinged @entity75 during the candidate self - introductions , saying that he was " an authentic conservative , not a conservative of convenience			2
" as mentioned , @entity63 and @entity75 got into a shouting match over illegal immigration , and they also battled over jobs			1
" @entity75 , while you were the governor of @entity76 in that period of time , you were 47th in the nation in job creation			0
during that same period of time , we created 20 times more jobs , " charged @entity63			0
@entity184 , @entity63 's communications director , told reporters in the post-debate spin room that the @entity64 governor was n't too aggressive in his attacks against @entity75 , adding that " i think the governor spoke from the heart			1
" asked if @entity63 was presidential in his approach at the debate , @entity184 said " i think he was @entity63 in his approach and that 's a good thing for us			1
" @entity197 , @entity75 's senior adviser , disagreed , telling reporters that " @entity63 had a strategy coming into this debate to kill @entity75 , and he ended up killing himself			1
" @entity155 wants more attention paid to @entity70 @entity51 's the fighter : he 's low in the polls and he is n't rich with campaign cash , but @entity51 's excelling at going on the attack and grabbing attention at the debates			0
@entity51 hammered @entity75 over the @entity76 health care law , saying " you just do n't have credibility			0
your consultants helped craft @entity212			0
" he slammed @entity9 over the " 9 - 9 - 9 " plan , saying " @entity9 's well - meaning , and i love his boldness , and it 's great			1
but the fact of the matter is , i mean , reports are now out that 84 percent of @entity220 would pay more taxes under his plan			0
" plus , he went after both @entity63 and @entity75 over the @entity224 , known as the @entity226 bailout , which is despised by conservatives			1
" the problem is -- in the first place , is that several people up here , the , quote , " businesspeople , " supported the @entity224 , supported the bailout			0
@entity233 , @entity75 , " said @entity51			0
@entity51 may be low down in the field , but the good news for him is that there are plenty of debates ahead , including three next month			0
ireporter saw very little new immigration questions not going away : this was supposed to be an election about jobs and the economy , but the topic of illegal immigration continues to rear its head on the campaign trail and in debates			0
@entity63 's poll numbers cratered in september after he defended a law in @entity64 that offers in - state college tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants -- a clear sign that @entity3 primary voters continue to be deeply concerned about the issue			1
@entity63 tried to throw the issue back at @entity75 on tuesday by criticizing his rival for hiring illegal immigrants to do work on his lawn , a controversy uncovered by the @entity263 during @entity75 's first presidential bid in 2008			1
" @entity75 , you lose all of your standing , from my perspective , because you hired illegals in your home and you knew about it for a year , " @entity63 said , turning straight to @entity75			1
" and the idea that you stand here before us and talk about that you 're strong on immigration is on its face the height of hypocrisy			0
" @entity75 admitted that a landscaping company he hired did employ illegal immigrants , but he said he fired the company when he found out			0
keen on scoring points with @entity3 voters , the candidates were united in saying that @entity122 has failed to fix the immigration system			0
i think the person who really has a problem with illegal immigration in the country is president @entity122 , " @entity45 said			0
" it 's his uncle and his aunt who are illegal aliens who 've been allowed to stay in this country , despite the fact that they 're illegal			0
