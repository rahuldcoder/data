@entity0 says he has " no problems " pushing policies in a 2016 @entity4 presidential primary that would allow more legal immigrants			1
the former @entity7 governor discussed his position tuesday on what could be a key issue for conservative voters in a brief interview with @entity15 's @entity14 affiliate , just hours after announcing on social media that he will " actively explore " a run for the @entity18			1
" you 've got ta protect the borders , enforce the law , be respectful of the rule of law , and at the same time , be able to encourage young , aspirational people to come to our country			1
it 's a win - win , " @entity0 said			1
" i have no problems advancing that idea			0
" asked whether much of the @entity4 's conservative base disagrees with @entity0 's position , he responded : " well , we 'll see			2
if i run , we 'll see			0
" @entity0 offered no more details on his timeline for a decision , saying that will come " at the proper time			2
" he said he plans to " listen to people and see if my message can resonate , and that will be beginning next year			0
" @entity0 is n't the only @entity4 to call for some expansions of @entity42 immigration policies			1
incoming senate majority leader @entity43 said this month that the @entity42 needs more @entity45 visas , which allow companies to bring skilled workers into the country			2
but calling for expanded immigration is problematic for many conservatives after a summer of reports of an influx of minors across the @entity42 - @entity55 border , and after president @entity57 's november decision to halt deportations for millions of undocumented parents of @entity42 citizens			1
@entity0 blasted @entity57 's immigration move last month , tweeting that it is an " abuse of power " and going to @entity66 to say his " ill - advised unilateral action on illegal immigration undermines all efforts to forge a permanent solution to this crisis			2
action must come in the form of bipartisan comprehensive reform passed through @entity72			0
" related : potential @entity0 bid sways none in @entity4 field those comments could put @entity0 uncomfortably at odds with similar moves -- though smaller in scope -- by both his father , @entity81 , whose " @entity83 " policy allowed 1.5 million relatives of newly legalized immigrants to avoid deportation while pursuing legal status , and his brother , @entity89 , who protected 150,000 @entity90 from deportation in 2001			1
the issue blew up on another candidate , @entity94 gov. @entity93 , during his 2012 run for the @entity18			0
defending a @entity94 law granting in - state tuition to undocumented immigrants , @entity93 said : " if you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they 've been brought there by no fault of their own , i do n't think you have a heart			0
" he was eviscerated by the right , where many conservatives called his position an endorsement of amnesty			0
it was among several issues that ultimately sank @entity93 's candidacy			0
another potential 2016 @entity4 candidate , @entity7 sen. @entity116 , could have problems with immigration , as well , after his push for comprehensive legislation drew conservatives ' ire			1
judge : @entity57 's immigration move unconstitutional			0

former @entity7 gov. @entity0 says he *'d* have " no problems " defending his call for " young , aspirational people " to legally immigrate to the @entity42
his comments came the day he announced on social media that he will " actively explore " a run for president in 2016
