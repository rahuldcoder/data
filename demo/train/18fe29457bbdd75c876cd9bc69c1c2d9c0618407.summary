-- @entity1 and her legal team began fighting for her life tuesday when a new jury heard opening arguments on whether she should receive a life or death sentence for her murder conviction			1
it 's been a long legal journey for @entity13 , 34 , whom a jury found guilty last year of first - degree murder in the gruesome killing of ex-boyfriend @entity1 , 30			1
this week 's court proceeding in @entity19 is a retrial of the penalty phase			0
in 2013 , the same jury that convicted her became deadlocked later on whether she should be executed for the 2008 murder of @entity25 , who was stabbed 29 times , shot in the face and had his neck slit from ear to ear			2
the impasse came when the jury voted 8 - 4 in favor of the death penalty for @entity13 , a source with knowledge of the jury 's vote said at the time			1
" the tale of this relationship is one of infinite sadness , " @entity13 's lawyer , @entity41 , told the jury @entity42			1
" the story of this relationship is one of tragedy , friendship , spirituality , lust , passion , forbidden sex , abuse and violence			0
" @entity41 said @entity13 went through an abusive childhood and developed a personality disorder early in life but had never committed a crime before the killing			1
she also suffered emotional abuse at the hands of @entity25 , he said			0
she is very remorseful and is punishing herself , he said			0
the only appropriate sentence is life in prison , @entity41 concluded			1
the prosecutor in the case , @entity73 , cast doubt on @entity13 's feelings toward @entity25 , saying " she loved him so much that after she slaughtered him she showed up at his memorial service			1
" @entity73 described the brutality of the slaying , telling the jury that @entity13 stabbed @entity25 first in the chest while he was nude in the shower , then continued to stab him in the back when he was already bleeding and leaning over the bathroom sink			1
after making his opening argument , @entity73 called police officers as the first witnesses			0
they showed the jury photos of the bloody scene in the bathroom			1
a death penalty requires a unanimous vote by the 12 jurors , and during the penalty retrial , a similar 12 - 0 vote will be required if @entity13 is to die by lethal injection , said @entity98 , spokesman for the @entity99			1
during the retrial , if all 12 jurors ca n't vote for death , then @entity13 will be eligible for one of two life sentences : life without the possibility of release or life with the possibility of release after 25 calendar years , @entity98 said			1
that means @entity13 and her legal team will need to persuade only one of the 12 jurors to vote against the death penalty for her to be spared from execution , @entity98 said			1
the judge swore in six men and 12 women as jurors for the penalty phase			2
nobody knows , not even the jurors , which of them will be the 12 to actually make a decision about @entity13 's life			1
graphic testimony expected the 12 jurors and eight alternates are expected to hear evidence for three to six weeks , @entity98 said			2
that testimony wo n't rehash whether @entity13 committed murder			1
that 's already been decided			0
rather , the jury will hear evidence from the prosecution on why a death sentence is warranted and from the defense on how @entity13 ' background and relationship with @entity25 pose mitigations favoring a life sentence , @entity98 said			1
nevertheless , the testimony is expected to be gruesome and grisly because prosecutors must show the murder was done in a " cruel , depraved or heinous " manner , among other factors , @entity98 said			0
" the state will be arguing and building on that theme , " @entity98 said			0
@entity13 ' legal team is arguing that life is " the appropriate penalty " for the convicted murderer for a number of reasons , according to court papers they filed this month			1
her legal team notes that @entity13 has no prior criminal history			1
she was only 27 when she killed @entity25 and has since been remorseful , according to court papers			0
she also has a psychological makeup that " impaired her ability to cope with the tumultuous relationship she had with mr. @entity25 , " court papers said			0
no live telecast until verdict unlike the 2013 trial , the penalty retrial wo n't be televised live			0
rather , judge @entity172 , who will preside over the retrial as she did in the 2013 trial , has ruled that while tv cameras will be permitted in the retrial , no video can be aired until a verdict has been rendered			0
the judge 's decision came after the defense argued that live tv coverage would keep their witnesses from testifying			0
the 2013 trial was sensational , attracting a media circus and a national audience riveted by themes of sex , violence and 18 days of testimony by @entity13 , who detailed what she called an abusive relationship with @entity25 but claimed she remembered nothing of his killing			1
public fascination the trial also featured phone sex conversations between @entity13 and her boyfriend as well as video of her interrogation by police			2
the public also became fascinated with @entity13 because she took the stand in her defense			1
more recently , she sought to act as her own attorney in the penalty phase retrial and was initially granted permission in august			0
but @entity13 changed her mind in september			2
during last year 's trial , jurors and the public saw @entity13 on video making a number of declarations to police investigating the murder			2
" i 'm not a murderer , " she told detectives			0
" if i killed @entity220 , i would beg for the death penalty			0
" the police video also showed her doing bizarre behavior when left alone in a police room : she began stretching and doing handstands			0
in another police interview , @entity13 blamed @entity25 's killing on intruders			2
" they did n't discuss much , they just argued , " @entity13 told a detective			2
" about what ? " the detective said			0
" about whether or not to kill me			0
" " for what reason ? " " because i 'm a witness , " @entity13 said on video			2
then came a moment of high courtroom drama : the packed gallery sat in stunned disbelief when @entity13 took the stand in her defense			1
" did you kill @entity1 on june 4th , 2008 ? " the attorney asked her			0
" yes , i did , " she said			0
" why ? " " um , the simple answer is that he attacked me , and i defended myself , " @entity13 said			2
but the jury did n't buy it and convicted her of first - degree murder .			2

new : defense lawyer says @entity13 had abusive childhood , personality disorder
new : prosecutor describes the bloody slaying in a bathroom
a 12 - 0 vote by jury is required to execute @entity13 by lethal injection
this means @entity13 ' lawyers need to convince only one juror to support a life sentence
