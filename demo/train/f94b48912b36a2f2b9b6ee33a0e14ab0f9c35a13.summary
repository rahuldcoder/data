-- a sharp increase in the price of @entity4 oil helped drive @entity6 gasoline prices up about 12 cents a gallon since late january , according to a new nationwide survey			1
the latest @entity10 found the average price of regular gasoline rose to $ 3.51 per gallon , publisher @entity9 said sunday			1
the survey canvasses about 2,500 filling stations in the continental @entity6 twice a month			0
@entity16 crude , the @entity6 benchmark fuel , remained largely flat between january 20 and friday , when the most recent survey was conducted			0
there 's a glut of the fuel on @entity6 markets , so its price went up only 21 cents a barrel between surveys , @entity9 said			2
but @entity28 's benchmark @entity27 crude -- another fuel commonly used in @entity6 gasoline -- traded up by $ 7.45 per barrel over the same period			1
@entity9 blamed the jump on reduced production from @entity4 platforms , tensions among @entity35 , its @entity37 neighbors and western powers and a dispute between @entity40 and newly independent @entity41 that has cut off southern oil from global markets			0
" @entity27 is highly sensitive to these events , " she said			0
meanwhile , @entity6 retailers have little margin to absorb the increased fuel prices , meaning pump prices may edge up " a few more pennies " in the coming weeks , @entity9 said			2
the lowest prices in the latest survey were in @entity52 , where regular gas cost an average of $ 3.01 a gallon			1
the highest were on @entity57 's @entity56 , at $ 3.82			2
