@entity0 -- the man who rescued an 11 - year - old girl lost in a dense @entity5 swamp said wednesday that @entity6 led him directly to her and that finding her was no surprise			1
@entity8 said he set out on his own to look for @entity9 on tuesday , trusting that he was going in the right direction even when that meant through water or dense brush			1
" i was expecting to hear her voice , " @entity8 told @entity1			2
" so i 'm yelling , ' @entity9 ! ' and at one point , i yell , ' @entity9 ! ' and i hear ' what ? ' and i said that way -- right there			2
" @entity19 , @entity9 's mother , said later wednesday that the family is " so fortunate @entity6 used him to bring her back			1
" " she 's doing remarkably well , " @entity9 said			1
" she has swollen feet and lots of bug bites and scratches , but she 's doing great			2
" dr. @entity26 , who treated the girl when she arrived at the hospital , said that @entity9 was in good shape but that she would remain hospitalized a little longer because of a bacterial infection			1
" when she got here , she was a little bit dehydrated but she had been resuscitated pretty well , " @entity31 said , " and she looked remarkably well considering she had been out for four and half days			0
" @entity8 said he was surprised at the good shape @entity9 was in			1
she had been missing since friday			0
shoeless and covered in insect bites , she was in otherwise good condition , he said			0
" she was not panicked			0
she looked like she had been sitting there , waiting on me , " he said			0
the two of them then stayed in the swamp , near @entity39 in central @entity5 , while @entity8 called authorities			1
when he got hold of the 911 dispatcher , he put @entity9 on the phone			2
i 'm the girl who got lost , " came the little girl 's voice			2
@entity8 said it took him " two hours of rough time " trekking through the swamp to find @entity9			1
he said he figures it took @entity9 just as long to reach the same spot			2
she told @entity8 that she had gone on a nature walk and simply got lost			2
" we are so , so grateful , " @entity9 's father , @entity54 , said			1
" i ca n't even express how we felt when she was found -- beyond words			0
" the swamp was so dense , @entity8 said , that the rescuers who carried @entity9 out on a black cloth stretcher tuesday had to use machetes to cut through the brush , bushes and trees			1
" i see it as an answer to a lot of people 's prayers , " @entity8 told @entity1			1
" i 'm just very thankful , i 'm thankful that @entity6 used me as a part of it to be able to find her			0
it 's definitely a miracle			0
" i did n't know where she was			0
the only person who knew where she was was @entity6 , and i asked him and he led me directly to her , straight -- well , as straight as you can go through the swamp			0
" @entity8 said he prayed the whole time he was searching , even when it seemed like he was going in the wrong direction			1
in one case , he said , there was water all around and he did n't know where to go			0
" he said , ' go that way			0
' and i 'm looking at water			0
i said , ' lord , are you sure ? ' he said			0
' and as soon as i start walking , the ground under the water is solid			0
it 's only about a foot and a half deep			0
he took care of me all the way there			0
" the disappearance of @entity9 , described as mildly autistic , had sparked an @entity102 that was canceled when @entity8 found her			1
both @entity8 and @entity9 's family at one time attended the same church , @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity5 , but they did n't know one another -- though @entity8 said @entity9 did seem to register him as a friendly face when she was found			1
the church held an open - air thanksgiving service to celebrate @entity9 's return tuesday evening			1
" give the glory to @entity6 , " @entity9 's father told reporters after seeing his daughter tuesday			1
@entity8 had brought trail mix and drinks to give to @entity9 if he found her , but he also brought another important item -- toilet paper			1
the swamp vegetation was so thick that the helicopter that came to retrieve @entity9 and @entity8 could n't see them on the ground			1
@entity8 said he heard the chopper overhead and tried to give the dispatcher directions for the pilot , but it still did n't work			1
" i had brought toilet paper for signaling , and so i covered the top of a couple of bushes that were in more of an open area than i was in , " @entity8 told @entity1			2
" they still had a hard time finding me , but i used that on the top ( of the bushes ) and they finally were able to locate it			0
" authorities questioned @entity8 after they got to safety , something @entity8 said was unexpected but understandable , especially given his ability to find @entity9 so quickly			1
" they also have a job to do , " he said			0
" they have a responsibility to the community to make sure there is no foul play			0
and so i understand that , i understood it completely			0
" coming out of the swamp was a blur with lots of hugs and praise , @entity8 said			2
he said he hopes to be able to see the @entity9 family again , and that @entity9 even hinted he 'd be welcome : " she said she might invite me to her pizza party			2
