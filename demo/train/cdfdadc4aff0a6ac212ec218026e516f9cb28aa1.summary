this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity15 , @entity16 : hi , i 'm @entity18			2
this is @entity0 , coming to you from @entity21 , @entity22 , where we saw some unseasonal snowflakes over the weekend ... in @entity22 ! some parts of the country , though , are dealing with much worse conditions than we are			2
first up : @entity29 @entity30 : especially the midwestern @entity32 a powerful snowstorm plowed through that part of the country over the weekend			2
parts of @entity36 got more than a foot and a half of snow , the state 's governor declaring a state of emergency for more than 70 counties			1
what that does is help free up emergency workers and resources to help deal with it			2
@entity5 got hit pretty badly , too			2
in @entity4 , the hometown @entity50 were supposed to play an @entity53 game against the @entity54 yesterday			2
but this before - and - after picture shows you why that could n't happen			2
that is the @entity59 , the @entity50 ' stadium			2
on the left is what the roof is supposed to look like			2
on the right : what it looked like yesterday			2
the roof caved in ! this is a dome that 's held up by air pressure			1
and after it got more than 17 inches of snow , just too much extra weight caused it to fail			1
some workers were up on top , trying to shovel off the snow			1
they 're not sure how long it 's gon na take for the building to open back up			1
the @entity50 game got moved back until tonight , and it 'll be played in @entity78			2
@entity79 @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 : i took my time and then , after i laid the wreath , i said thank you for your service			2
and i think it 's just awesome being here laying these wreaths			1
@entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 : i read whose name was there and their dates and said a thank you			2
these are men and women who have given the ultimate			0
all gave some , some gave all			0
@entity30 : two of the hundreds of volunteers who helped lay wreaths on the gravesites of @entity32 troops at @entity110 this weekend			0
it 's a tradition that 's been going on for nearly 20 years , and it happened at hundreds of other cemeteries across the country			1
@entity114 @entity115 , @entity16 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm a @entity118 nation located between @entity119 and @entity120			0
i gained my independence from @entity123 in 1960			0
my official name is @entity6			1
many people know me as @entity6 , and i 'm home to around 21 million people			1
political crisis @entity30 : @entity6 , or @entity6 , is in the middle of a political crisis			1
after a run - off in the country 's recent presidential election , both candidates -- the current president and one of his opponents -- declared victory			1
that 's not gon na work			1
the heads of other @entity118 countries say the idea of two leaders just is n't for @entity6			1
@entity144 gets us up to speed on the situation			0
( begin video ) @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 : sworn in as president of @entity6 , @entity151 stands defiant			1
the @entity6 people did not elect him president , says the international community			1
this man , @entity156 , who has also sworn himself in , is the true president , according to the independent electoral commission @entity32 secretary of state hillary clinton : we are in full agreement that @entity156 is the rightfully - elected president of @entity6 , and that former president @entity151 should respect the results of the election and peacefully transfer power to his successor			1
@entity166 : since the election results were announced this month , there has been a dangerous stalemate in @entity6 , a standoff threatening to degenerate into civil war			1
in the early 1990s , @entity6 , or @entity6 , was the economic powerhouse of @entity118 and attracted immigrants from across the region			1
but as that economic success began to falter , people in the south of the country turned on what they saw as immigrants in the north			0
and in 2002 , the country was split by civil war			0
but now , it seems that weeks of regional and international pressure are forcing @entity151 to the negotiating table			0
@entity151 , incumbent president of @entity6 [ @entity188 ] : there 's no war , and we need to sit down and talk			1
if there 's a problem , we 'll talk about it			1
but men do n't hold discussions when things are still hot			0
they wait for things to cool down to start			0
so when it 'll cool down , we 'll talk			0
so , there wo n't be a war			0
i thank you for all that you have done for the @entity6			1
we are together and the problems you see now , we will resolve them			0
@entity166 : whatever the discussions , other influential @entity118 leaders say a unity government that includes both leaders is unacceptable			1
@entity210 , president of @entity212 : it 's immediate , it 's immediate			1
elections have been declared , somebody has won , so he has to hand over			1
@entity166 : but talks do not mean action , and for now , the uneasy standoff between the two presidents continues			0
@entity144 , @entity0 , @entity150 , @entity212			0
( @entity221 ) @entity222 @entity30 : okay , from @entity118 , we 're heading over to @entity7 , @entity8 , where a two - week conference on climate change ended with an agreement			0
representatives from around the world came up with a plan that @entity8 's president is calling the start of " a new era of cooperation in climate change			1
" among other things , the agreement will create a $ 100 billion fund to help developing countries deal with climate change			1
you see a lot of people clapping here , but not everyone likes this deal			0
the government of @entity246 says the agreement wo n't be effective			0
and @entity246 claims that wealthier nations bullied other countries into accepting the deal			0
this day in history [ @entity251 ] december 13 , 2000 -- @entity252 concedes defeat to @entity254 in the @entity32 presidential election december 13 , 2003 -- former @entity257 leader @entity256 is captured by @entity32 soldiers december 13 , 2007 -- the @entity259 on the use of performance enhancing drugs in @entity263 is released @entity264 @entity30 : in @entity269 , a school 's trying to get students to pull up their saggy pants by giving teachers zip ties that they 'll use as belts on the students ' pants			1
on our blog , 71 percent of you think the " no saggy pants " policy is a good idea			0
@entity280 likes it , but here 's what she has a problem with : " the wall of shame that shows photos of students with their pants hiked high			1
" most of you do n't agree with the photo board			0
@entity293 says that low riding defines certain people , and adds " if you do n't like it , do n't look at it			0
" and @entity299 argues , " teachers do n't have the right to decide what students wear ; it should be up to parents "			1
but @entity306 writes that " everywhere you turn , there are pants on the ground or someone 's underwear showing			1
" she bets 80 percent of her school does n't own a belt			0
@entity315 calls showing your underwear , " gross			0
it would be so embarrassing if a girl saw your underwear			0
" and @entity319 calls saggy pants very unattractive , saying , " i know i do n't wan na see boxers			0
" add your comment at @entity323			0
remember , it 's first names only ! @entity326 @entity327 , @entity16 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity330 ' history classes at @entity331 in @entity332 , @entity333 ! what is the name of this trophy ? is it the : a ) @entity339 , b ) @entity340 , c ) @entity342 or @entity343 ) @entity338 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! you 're looking at the @entity342 , the award for the most outstanding college football player			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity349 @entity30 : this year 's @entity342 winner is @entity351 , the quarterback from @entity352			1
he won the award on saturday night			0
@entity351 has thrown or run for 48 touchdowns this year , leading @entity352 to an undefeated season and a spot in the national championship game , and that 's coming up in january			1
but he 's also been the focus of some controversy			1
the @entity361 ruled that @entity351 's father was involved in a pay - for - play scandal			1
essentially , he told schools that they had to pay money for @entity351 to play football there			0
an @entity361 investigation determined that neither @entity351 nor @entity352 knew what @entity351 's father was doing , so he 's been cleared to play			1
original rules sold @entity30 : just how important are the rules in sports ? we 're about to show you a set of rules that sold for more than $ 4 million ! it 's the " @entity379 , " written by the man who 's considered the inventor of the game : @entity383			1
it 's a 119 - year - old document that was auctioned off last friday			1
in the original rules , players could pass the ball , but not run with it ; there was no provision for dribbling			1
and there was n't any physical contact			0
things have , of course , changed a bit since then			0
the couple who bought the rules is hoping to donate them to @entity400 , where @entity383 was a coach			2
before we go @entity30 : before we go , competitions are n't always fun and games			0
but here 's one that sure seems like it is			2
it 's a robotics competition in @entity410			2
but here 's the catch : the robots have to be built from @entity414			2
350 students participate in the event			2
they had to use @entity414 to build robots that could complete a series of tasks			0
by watching it , you 'd be pretty impressed			0
if we had to compete , i do n't even know what kind of robot we 'd design			0
goodbye @entity30 : there are a few ideas we could toy around with			0
not gon na share any of them , though			0
after all , we would n't want to @entity414 any of our secrets			0
whoo ! all right , it 's no secret that @entity0 returns tomorrow			2
we 'll look forward to seeing you then			0
remember , this is our last week on the air before the break			0
