-- @entity2 ' fall from grace culminated tuesday with a five - year sentence in the shooting death of his girlfriend			1
the sentence was imposed for the charge of culpable homicide , which in @entity9 means a person was killed unintentionally , but unlawfully			1
under @entity9 law , he will have to serve at least one - sixth of his sentence -- 10 months -- before he can ask to be placed under correctional supervision , usually house arrest , instead			2
@entity2 was also given a three - year sentence on a firearms charge , but it was suspended for five years on condition he 's not found guilty of another crime where there 's negligence involving a firearm during that period			1
that count related to an occasion when @entity2 discharged a handgun under a table in a busy restaurant			2
during his trial , the double - amputee sprinter often sobbed at the mention of his girlfriend @entity35 's name			1
he insisted that he mistook her for an intruder when he shot her through a toilet door on @entity39 2013			0
but there was very little visible reaction from @entity2 as the sentence was read out in the @entity44 court			1
speaking to @entity0 's @entity45 in the last few weeks before his sentencing , @entity2 told her that he would respect and accept the decision of the court and that he was not afraid of imprisonment			1
he said he hoped to contribute while in prison by teaching people how to read or start a gym or running club			0
" @entity2 will embrace this opportunity to pay back to society , " his uncle , @entity53 , told reporters			2
" as an uncle , i hope @entity2 will start his own healing process as he walks down the path of restoration			2
as a family , we are ready to support and guide @entity2 as he serves his sentence			1
" the @entity35 family 's lawyer , @entity64 , said in a statement : " the family is satisfied			1
they are glad that it is over and are satisfied that justice has been done			2
" is the @entity2 's career finished ? question of appeal the prosecution had asked for a minimum prison sentence of 10 years for @entity2			1
after the ruling tuesday , @entity9 's @entity75 said it had not yet decided whether to appeal judge @entity78 's verdict that he is not guilty of murder			1
@entity2 ' defense had called for a sentence of house arrest and community service			1
there was no immediate reaction from the defense team on the sentencing			0
both sides now have a 14 - day period in which they can choose to lodge any appeal , according to @entity0 legal analyst @entity91			0
on the eve of @entity2 ' sentencing , his sister told @entity45 that the lives of everyone close to the trial have already been changed forever , no matter the outcome			2
" no one who 's been close to the situation can just overcome it , " @entity100 said			0
" it 's something my brother will carry with him forever and ... regardless of what 's happening now , it 's just a certain phase in a journey that will never end			0
" ' mine and mine alone ' giving her reasoning tuesday , @entity78 emphasized that the decision on sentencing would be " mine and mine alone			2
" she pointed out that sentencing is not an exact science but relies on an assessment of elements , including the nature and seriousness of the crime , the personal circumstances of the accused and the interests of society			0
she said she would also take into account the factors in sentencing of retribution , deterrence and rehabilitation			0
in any case , she said , " sentencing is about achieving the right balance			0
" what will @entity2 face in prison ? prison not ' insurmountable challenge ' in her final remarks , @entity78 dismissed evidence given by probation officer @entity146 that prison would not be able to accommodate @entity2 ' disability , saying her testimony was based on outdated information and sketchy			1
she said @entity2 would not present the prison system with an " insurmountable challenge			1
" the judge added that she felt that @entity2 ' vulnerability had been overemphasized in the evidence given and that his excellent coping strategies -- shown in his ability to compete with able - bodied athletes -- had been overlooked			1
he would be able to continue treatment for physical problems and mental health issues while in prison , she said			0
factors in her decision in terms of the seriousness of the offense , @entity78 said @entity2 had shown gross negligence in shooting into a small toilet cubicle , knowing there was someone inside who could not escape			1
he also knew how to handle firearms , she said , adding that these were " very aggravating " factors			0
on the other hand , mitigating factors include that @entity2 is a first offender and remorseful , @entity78 said			1
she also mentioned his contribution to society in giving his time and money to charities and inspiring others with disabilities to believe they could succeed			0
perhaps seeking to preempt criticism from those who 'd like to see either a tougher or more lenient sentence , @entity78 pointed out that the purpose of the court is to serve the public interest , not make itself popular			1
she also indicated that her sentence was n't affected by @entity2 ' fame			1
" it would be a sad day for this country if the impression was to be created that there was one law for the poor and disadvantaged and another for the rich and famous , " she said			0
the judge also highlighted the loss suffered by @entity35 's family , which has had a negative effect on her father 's health			1
@entity35 was young , vivacious and full of life at the time of her death , she said			2
" the loss of life can not be reversed			0
nothing i say or do today can reverse what happened , " she said			0

he was born without the fibulae in his legs , which were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old			0
at the @entity222 , he ran on special carbon fiber blades that earned him the nickname " @entity2			2
" even though he did n't win a medal , he became an inspiration to the disabled and a national hero in @entity9			0
he took home three medals from the @entity233 , held shortly afterward			0
the @entity234 declined to say tuesday whether @entity2 would be allowed to compete again after being sentenced for @entity35 's killing			1
