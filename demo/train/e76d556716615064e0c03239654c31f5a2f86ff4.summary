@entity0 , @entity1 -- is it really safe ? @entity1 's governor is asking federal authorities to do further study on the possible health effects caused by last month 's chemical spill near @entity0			1
" it is critical this study is funded and that work begins immediately , " wrote gov. @entity9 in a letter tuesday to dr. @entity11 , director of the @entity12			1
on january 9 , the chemical -- 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol , or @entity18 -- was discovered leaking from a storage tank into the @entity20 and from there into @entity0 's water supply			1
its licorice smell alerted residents to the contamination and led to a do - not - use order for 300,000 @entity27 , some of whom could not drink or bathe in their water for more than a week			1
it also underscored that little is known about the health effects of the chemical , which is used to wash coal prior to market in order to reduce ash			1
the spill was originally estimated at about 7,500 gallons , but @entity39 said late last month that about 10,000 gallons of chemical had escaped			1
the company also told regulators that a second chemical -- a mix of polyglycol ethers , known as @entity46 -- was part of the leak			2
" i am committed to the health and well - being of @entity27 and believe there is a pressing need to further study the potential health effects resulting from exposure to water contaminated with crude @entity18 and @entity46 , " @entity9 said			1
an independent water test conducted early this month at @entity2 's request found trace levels of @entity18 , both in untreated river water and in tap water from two homes in @entity0			1
the amounts ranged from less than 0.5 parts per billion to 1.6 parts per billion -- well below the 1 part per million that the @entity12 has said it considers unlikely to be associated with any adverse health effects			1
" we stand willing to continue to assist and will be discussing with officials there what additional toxicology and epidemiology studies may be needed , " said @entity67 , a @entity12 spokeswoman			1
dr. @entity73 , the health officer and executive director of the @entity0 and @entity76 health departments , has called for a long - term study to be carried out " in a manner able to capture any long - term impact			1
" in the wake of the spill , two waves of patients sought treatment from private doctors and 10 emergency rooms in a nine - county area for non-specific symptoms such as rash , nausea , vomiting and cough , @entity73 told @entity2 on wednesday			2
the first peak -- about 250 patients -- occurred in the first three days after the spill was reported on january 9 , he said			2
a lull ensued during the several days of the do - not - use advisory , followed by a second peak -- about the same number -- during the first few days after the advisory was lifted on january 13 , he said			0
there is widespread distrust of the water , with only about 1 % of the 200 people who attended town hall meetings in late january about the matter saying they were drinking it , he said			0
@entity73 , who has a masters degree in public health , acknowledged that his findings were " non-scientific " and that he did not know what the baseline incidence would be of patients appearing at an er with such symptoms , but said the anecdotes point to the need for further studies			0
" those two peaks are undeniable , " he said			0
" perhaps there is something going on here			0
" @entity73 said the water in his own house continues to smell of licorice , and that he avoids drinking tap water , though he would not be opposed to doing so			0
" the question becomes , is a pregnant mom going to drink it ? should developing brains of children be drinking it ? " the @entity12 has expressed similar concerns			1
" due to limited availability of data , and out of an abundance of caution , pregnant women may wish to consider an alternative drinking water source until the chemical is at non-detectable levels in the water distribution system , " it said in a paper dated february 5			2
" for mothers with babies , there is no research that suggests consuming water with these low levels of @entity18 poses any health risk to their baby			2
however , if you have any concerns , please consult your doctor			0
" but the @entity154 said in a posting on february 10 that some symptoms , such as nausea and headaches , may not indicate that the chemicals were harmful			0
" these symptoms are not due to toxic effects but are a body 's physical and real response to unusual smells / tastes , " it said , adding that the poison center received calls from more than 1,900 patients reporting chemical exposures related to the drinking water in the days after the spill was reported			1
" @entity174 reported symptoms included mild rashes and reddened skin from dermal exposure , or @entity180 distress ( nausea , vomiting and / or diarrhea ) from ingesting contaminated water			0
the symptoms tended to be mild and self - limiting			0
" it urged that anyone with continuing symptoms be evaluated for other medical conditions , and noted that viral gastroenteritis , influenza , the common cold and other infections are all common at this time of year			0
a spokeswoman for @entity193 said the company was continuing to flush the system to get rid of pockets of licorice smell that remain			2
" for us , it 's not over until we resolve the odor issue , " said @entity198			0
dr. @entity202 , the director of the @entity12 's @entity12 , told reporters on february 5 that repeated testing had shown the water to be acceptable for all uses			1
" what i can say is that with all the scientific evidence that we have , with everything that numerous people have worked on so far , i can say that you can use your water however you like , " @entity202 said			0
" you can drink it , you can bathe in it , you can use it how you like			0
" @entity9 said then that tests had shown levels of less than 10 parts per billion or too low to detect , and that he and his staff had been drinking the water " for the last couple of weeks			1
" but when asked whether he could declare it " 100 % safe , " he said , " no. " " the only thing that we can rely upon is what the experts tell us , and , you know , for all the tests done that 's who we 've got to depend upon , " @entity9 said			2
a federal grand jury is probing the spill at @entity39 , sources familiar with the grand jury 's activities have told @entity2			0
@entity2 's @entity237 and @entity238 reported from @entity0 , @entity239 reported and wrote from @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 contributed to this report .			0

" perhaps there is something going on here , " says county health officer
" we stand willing to continue to assist , " says @entity12 spokeswoman
a chemical spill last month led to continuing concerns about the safety of water
" it is critical this study is funded and that work begins immediately , " gov. @entity9 says
