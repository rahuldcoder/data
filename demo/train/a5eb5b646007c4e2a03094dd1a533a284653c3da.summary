-- the @entity2 family may be one of the few in the country who wo n't be too disappointed if it rains over the @entity6 weekend			2
joining family or friends at a vacation rental home is a great way to spend time together and save money			1
" we just play indoor games in the cabins , " says @entity12			1
for the last 20 years , she explains , her extended family -- 30 strong and including four generations -- has gathered at rustic cabins on @entity19 in @entity20 for some old - fashioned fun			1
they crowd into four cabins ( showers are a walk away ) , tote everything they need ( even toilet paper ) and divide all the chores			1
and they would n't have it any other way			2
maybe it 's the economy			2
maybe it 's the need to reconnect with friends and family			2
at beach houses and on sailboats , city condos and mountain cabins , families and friends are joining forces on vacation			1
according to a new survey from @entity49 of people with children , nearly a third report they will vacation with another family this year to save money -- a significant jump from 2008			1
" we get calls daily from family and friends who want to get together in our cabins , " says @entity52 from @entity53 in @entity54 where cabins that sleep nine or more start at $ 195			1
cabins can be rented for even less in @entity61 at the @entity62 of the @entity63 where my family has also shared quarters -- and cooking chores -- with relatives at a family reunion			1
more visitors to @entity71 are opting to split condos rather than get individual hotel rooms , adds @entity74 of @entity75 , which has hotels , condo resorts and villas all across @entity71			2
even @entity79 is getting into the act , with new @entity82 options that you can turn into your home away from home			2
in @entity90 , @entity86 at @entity87 and @entity88 at @entity89 are brand - new with a third villa resort slated to open later this summer			1
another resort is expected to open at @entity93 in @entity94 in the fall			2
you do the math. whether you are at rustic cabins or a luxurious beachfront rental house , you 'll spend less when splitting costs with another family			1
especially this year with rental owners -- 66 percent -- offering special deals to encourage business , according to a survey from @entity106 , the leading online vacation rental web site			1
they 're throwing in everything from a free night to free cleaning service , discounts , even tickets to a local attraction or food			1
no wonder families are joining forces on everything from city apartment rentals ( lots cheaper than a hotel ! ) to road trips to tours of @entity123			2
@entity124 and her son joined forced with another family and , says @entity124 , " stayed in several suites where we could cook our meals , had cereal breakfasts and packed picnic lunches when we could			2
" and they spent less than they would have on a cruise			2
" we saw everything we wanted ( except @entity136 stayed hidden behind clouds )			0
" when the kids were small , we met up every summer in @entity139 at @entity141 's @entity140 where we ate the fish we caught for dinner and the kids would chase frogs and ride in the special car that goes in the water			0
we 've shared @entity148 and @entity150 houses , and every winter , @entity61 ski condos with friends and family			0
our next trip may be our farthest afield shared trip -- a sailboat in @entity158 with another family and two of my daughter @entity164 's oldest camp friends -- the girls ' high school graduation present			0
but these trips are about much more than saving money			0
" i love that our group can get together once a year or every other year and feel like we have n't missed a beat , " says @entity169 , a geologist from @entity170 , @entity171			1
@entity169 gathers with her college friends and their children at a vacation home owned by one of the group			1
single mom @entity179 adds that it was much more relaxing to join forces with another single mom than to take her young daughter solo			0
besides sharing the cost of rent at a beach house in @entity171 , groceries and rental car , she was able to get a much - needed break -- far more relaxing than the solo trip she took to @entity71			1
" plus it was nice to sit with someone on the deck at night , drink wine and laugh about the day 's adventures			1
" " it helps with your sanity for sure , kids seem to play better when they have other kids to play with -- the more children , the busier they keep each other , " says @entity197 , the @entity198 mom of two young daughters who has rented condos in @entity201 and elsewhere with other families			0
" you truly feel you are on vacation , " she says			1
and that is n't easy to accomplish with young kids in tow			0
there are some rules to be sure			0
never discipline anyone else 's child , for one			0
that 's a parent 's prerogative			0
@entity220 , who rents vacation homes as a business ( www.seaestahomes.com ) and who hosts her college group of seven families , says the hardest part is choosing the date			1
make sure there are enough bedrooms , bathrooms and a common space where the kids can hang out in addition to the adults			1
" a swimming pool is mandatory , " she adds			0
" just remember that where you are is n't as important as the place you rent			0
" rates for some three - bedroom vacation homes start at just $ 99 per night , but sleep up to eight travelers , not just one or two , notes @entity242 , president of the @entity243			1
be clear how you are dividing the costs			0
in her case , each family takes a day of the week and gets groceries , cooks dinner and cleans up			0
other families simply split costs			0
some divide the rent based on the number of bedrooms they are using or split the cost straight down the middle			1
however you do it , suggests @entity169 , keep it simple			0
" there is no need to schedule a lot of activities for the children			0
" the beauty of a vacation like this is allowing the kids to entertain themselves			1
a pool or the beach may be all they need			0
and once the kids are in bed , says @entity275 , the grown - ups can enjoy some " adult " time			2
they 're not stuck staring at the wall in a hotel room watching the children sleep			2
there 's no corralling kids in restaurants , no getting dressed to feed the hungry preschoolers in an ( overpriced ) hotel dining room , no worrying about a tired toddler melting down in a hotel lobby			0
there 's no worrying about the rain either			0
" with a 30 - person family , we make up our own entertainment , " says @entity291			1
that 's the best kind			0
