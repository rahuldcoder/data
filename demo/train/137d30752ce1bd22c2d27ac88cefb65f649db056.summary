-- @entity1 is already the reigning queen of @entity2 , with her nearly 19 million followers topping those of anyone else on the site			1
now , she 's launching a site of her own			2
little monsters , now in invite - only beta testing , is the pop princess 's effort at creating a network built around her fan base -- which she 's dubbed the aforementioned " monsters			0
" an early look at the site suggests it will be designed a lot like @entity18 , the fast - emerging mobile app that lets users " pin " locations and items that they like			0
@entity1 's site also will emphasize sharing and creating photos and videos , as well as letting other users promote content from others that they like ( something similar to sites like @entity33 and @entity34 )			1
the site is the first project by @entity37 , the startup where @entity1 's manager , @entity39 , is one of four founders			1
the company will focus on online community - building			0
" backplane is about bringing together communities and @entity1 's community just so happens to be the community we 're using to learn about proper functionality , " ceo @entity43 said to @entity44 , a @entity0 content partner			2
" we think we can really change the world			0
" when other sites are launched , @entity37 allows user to switch back and forth among as many as they want			0
even with @entity1 's massive social - media presence ( she was the first artist to hit 1 billion @entity60 video views ) , it remains an open question whether a social site devoted almost exclusively to her fans will have a big enough user base to fly			1
at @entity65 , another @entity0 content partner , @entity67 imagines chat on the site this way : @entity71 1 : " @entity1 sure knows how to rock a bad - ass meat dress			1
" @entity73 : " i think that getup must have smelled horrible			0
" @entity75 : " @entity1 always smells like roses ! " ( squishes @entity73 ) " carry on with the idolatry you little monsters ! " what do you think ? does this site have a chance ?			2

@entity1 is launching her own social networking site
@entity1 is *geared* toward sharing and *rating* photos and other content
