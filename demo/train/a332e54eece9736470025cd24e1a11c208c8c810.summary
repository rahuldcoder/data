editor 's note : @entity2 prosecuted federal and local crime for 12 years in the @entity6 attorney 's offices for the @entity7 and for the @entity8 and is now the executive director of the @entity10 at @entity11			1
@entity12 says @entity13 would provide the perspective of a former prosecutor on the high court			1
( @entity17 ) -- many have noted judge @entity13 's personal story -- from being raised by a single mother in a public housing project in the @entity22 to top honors at @entity24 and @entity25 and now , potentially the @entity26 -- will give her a perspective that other justices lack			1
but commentators typically miss another life experience of @entity13 's that will bring diversity to the court			1
if she is confirmed , she would be the only justice with experience as a local prosecutor			1
for five years , @entity13 was an assistant district attorney in @entity37			1
in that position , she interacted with some of the poorest , most troubled residents of @entity40 and handled matters ranging from shoplifting , prostitution and petty drug offenses to robberies , child abuse and murders			0
@entity13 's experience on the front lines in a big city 's fight against crime will bring a much - needed perspective to the court			1
only justice @entity55 has any real background at all in criminal law			2
he was an assistant @entity6 attorney and was later @entity6 attorney in @entity59			0
it 's quite likely that , as a result , @entity55 may have disproportionate influence on his colleagues in criminal cases because he can refer to that experience			1
but @entity55 was never a local prosecutor and has deep exposure only to federal criminal law			1
federal criminal cases make up only about 6 percent of all criminal cases , and they typically involve complex white - collar crimes and large - scale narcotics trafficking			0
federal prosecutors do not typically see the day - to - day carnage in neighborhoods from murders , rapes , burglaries , robberies and assault , or interact with the victims of those crimes			0
nor do they see low - level vice crimes such as prostitution , small - time drug deals or gambling			2
the other justices are even further removed from the realities of street crime			0
the only other justice who has even a modicum of criminal justice experience is @entity93 , whose exposure to criminal law as an architect of the federal sentencing guidelines was not to victims and criminals but to data and number crunchers			2
the other justices ' professional experiences are even more insulated from life on the streets			0
they spent their time in lofty government appellate or legal counsel positions , working in the halls of @entity111 , devising litigation strategies at top law firms or public interest organizations , or pondering legal questions as academics			1
even the justices ' experiences on the bench isolated them from the real world of criminal law			0
not a single member of the current @entity26 served on a state court -- the courts that handle about 94 percent of criminal cases			1
for that matter , no one on the @entity26 served on a federal district court , the trial courts in the federal system that see federal criminal cases up close			1
here , too , @entity13 fills a critical gap			1
in addition to her time in the @entity135 's office , she was also a federal district court judge for six years			1
@entity13 would bring a much - needed dose of reality when it comes to criminal law issues			2
it is all too easy for someone who has not spent time working on these issues to caricature them			2
for conservatives , the risk is assuming all crimes are a failure of personal responsibility that lead to serious breaches of public order and demand incarceration and a tough response			0
for liberals , the risk is seeing every defendant as a victim of poverty or society 's failures			2
the reality , as @entity13 knows well , is far more complicated			2
she has seen the human condition up close and personal			0
she knows the pain of victims and has looked into the eyes of defendants who have committed unspeakable acts with no remorse and are unredeemable			0
she has also seen defendants who need treatment and jobs , not prison			0
many of these individuals may have committed petty crimes , such as shoplifting or drug possession , to feed an addiction			0
this interaction with the criminal justice system also showed @entity13 on a daily basis just how powerful the state is and the tragedy that is every single criminal case			2
in no other area is government more intrusive			0
this is the power to lock someone in a cell , or even to take away life			0
@entity13 's experience shows her that this government power is sometimes necessary -- and sometimes is n't			1
she also knows that , in every criminal case , people suffer , and not just victims and defendants			0
family members , children and entire communities pay the price when we send away too many people for too long or fail to pay attention and do n't provide neighborhoods enough protection			0
one never knows how personal experience will translate to life on the bench			0
but @entity13 's experience in a big - city prosecution office would likely to make a difference on a bench that deals with crime every day but has very little real - world exposure to it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity12 : @entity13 's experience would set her apart on top court
he says her time as a local prosecutor gave her *invaluable* experience
@entity2 says that background would be of great value to @entity26
