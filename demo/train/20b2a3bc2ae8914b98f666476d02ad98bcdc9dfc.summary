-- @entity1 may have surrendered his no. 1 ranking to @entity3 , but he was not about to tighten his grip on the @entity6 title			1
@entity3 ended the @entity8 's 11 - month reign at the top by reaching sunday 's final , but could not stop @entity1 winning in @entity11 for the fourth time in five years			1
" i needed this win today			0
i really wanted to get my hands on the trophy and win against @entity3 , who has been the best player so far in 2013 , " the 26 - year - old said			2
" it 's very important for my confidence			2
it 's very important mentally and emotionally for me			2
" @entity1 has yet to taste defeat at the tournament , having not taken part in 2011 due to injury			1

i just love the conditions , " he said			0
" i love the court and the atmosphere that goes around the tournament			0
center court is exceptional , and i enjoy it			0
i try to cherish every moment that i spend here every year			0
" @entity1 is still hoping to be the @entity32 's year - end no. 1 for the third successive time , but he faces a tough task to displace @entity3 -- who has won two grand slams this year after returning from long - term knee problems in february			1
@entity3 had been on a 22 - match winning streak since his shock first - round defeat at @entity41 , and had beaten @entity1 three times in a row including last month 's @entity45 final to take his career advantage to 22 - 15			1

when that 's happening against a player like @entity1 , you are dead			1
you do n't have one chance			0
" both players will next move on to @entity67 , where @entity1 will be defending his @entity69 title -- if he can not then @entity3 could take advantage and move further ahead in the standings , having not played there last year			1
@entity73 also returns to action , with the former world no. 1 needing points to ensure his participation at the season - ending championships in @entity79 next month			1
@entity80 , meanwhile , will be taking a break ahead of the @entity82 in @entity83 , having won the 56th title of her career in @entity11 on sunday and her 10th of this season -- the best tally since @entity88 in 2007			1
the world no. 1 crushed formerly top - ranked @entity90 6 - 2 6 - 2 despite suffering an apparent recurrence of a back problem from earlier in the tournament			1
she is now seventh on the all - time @entity82 list , having moved above @entity95 and @entity96			0
the @entity97 has 73 match wins this year , the best since @entity100 ' 90 and @entity88 's 75 in 2003			1
" i really love tennis so much and it 's fans like the ones here in @entity107 who are so exciting to come to , " she said after her second success in @entity11 -- the other being in 2004 when it moved to @entity11			0
" the fans make me want to play , they 're so great here , so coming here is such a great opportunity			0
" @entity90 , the only woman to play in all 10 editions of the event , was unable to repeat her 2008 success			2
" @entity80 was just too good today , and big congratulations to her , " said the @entity8 eighth seed , who is hoping to clinch one of the remaining places for the @entity119 showpiece			1
