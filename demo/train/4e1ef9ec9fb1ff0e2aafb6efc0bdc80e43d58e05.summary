-- if you fall off while riding a bike , get back on it as soon as you can			0
that 's what conventional wisdom suggests			0
so what would be the advice to a cricketer who has inadvertently killed an opponent while bowling a short - pitched delivery ? according to one former @entity14 cricketer , it 's to deliver exactly the same ball			1
and that 's what happened when @entity19 @entity18 returned to action , bowling competitively for the first time since delivering the ' bouncer ' that resulted in the death of @entity24 late last month			1
the @entity25 ( @entity27 ) player on tuesday came on at the 12th over to applause from the small crowd at the @entity30 ( @entity31 ) -- the same venue as the november 25 incident -- in the first session of a domestic four - day match against @entity36			1
the over included a bouncer , his fifth ball			2
@entity41 went on to take two wickets and @entity27 bowling coach @entity43 praised the 22 - year - old 's resilience			0
" he 's practiced well , he 's looked good but you never know what 's underneath the surface with young guys , " said @entity43			0
" but the proof is in the pudding -- he got onto this field and he did the business			2
he 's a young guy on the way up and he played like it today so i guess his mindset is a pretty good one			0
" @entity25 players had black armbands on , in memory of @entity24			1
" @entity18 is doing the right thing by getting back on the pitch as soon as possible , " @entity62 , who played for @entity14 between 2000 - 2008 , told @entity0 prior to the start of tuesday 's game			1
" if , in his first over , he can bowl a bouncer -- just to get rid of the stigma -- then he should			1
" it would help get the horrible memory out of his mind			0
" " the longer he goes on without bowling a bouncer , the worse it will get			2
he needs to get back to bowling like he did			0
" @entity75 and @entity76 pay tribute the @entity19 test team also took to the field competitively , as the postponed @entity80 against @entity76 also began on tuesday in @entity81			1
prior to the game , players and coaching staff from both sides assembled on the field to honor @entity87			2
@entity24 was named as the 13th man for the match			1
a tribute by former @entity19 cricket captain and legendary commentary @entity92 played out followed by 63 seconds of applause			0
@entity24 , who had been tipped to earn an international recall for the @entity96 , had made 63 runs when he received the delivery that shocked and rocked the cricketing world			1
the @entity19 players all wore @entity24 ' test cap number , 408 , on their shirts as well as black armbands			2
in the build up , one of @entity75 's lead bowlers has said he will not be changing his approach against @entity76 , following an incident that has been frequently been described as ' freak ' by those within the game			1
" i 've been bowling very aggressive for the last 18 months and i 'm not going to change that , " @entity112 told reporters			0
however , the paceman was left in a more quizzical mood when asked how he would react if one of his short - pitched deliveries were to hit an @entity120 batsman			0
" i 'm not sure , " he replied			0
" it might be ( a ) different ( reaction ) this time			2
" @entity24 ' domestic team , @entity75 , took on @entity124 in @entity125			1
it was the first time also his former teammates had taken to the field since his death			1
both teams paused for 63 seconds before the start of play to remember @entity24			2
according to local @entity135 media , the @entity19 playets had " @entity138 " etched on their shirts , in reference to @entity24 ' @entity19 cap number			2
a bouncer is an aggressive delivery , pitched short and fast with a good ball rearing up at the batsman 's upper torso and head			0
@entity18 's ball to @entity24 hit the batsman on the back of the head -- @entity24 slumped to the floor and lost consciousness seconds after he was hit near his left ear			1
he was stretchered off the ground , put into an induced coma at hospital and and later died			0
' appalling incident ' @entity18 has received nothing but support from the cricket family across the globe but @entity62 hopes it can go one step further on tuesday			1
now retired , the former bowler believes the onus is on @entity27 's opponents @entity36 to help the 22 - year - old through his mental battle especially as his return to the game is at the same venue as the @entity24 incident			1
" to be stood at the wicket and run over the same spot where your friend died makes it doubly hard , " opined @entity62			0
" the opposition has a big part to play as they need to tell @entity18 to be himself and to bowl the short ball			1
" " bowling bouncers is within the laws of the game and they are part of a bowler 's armory , so you have to bowl short pitch			0
" i 'm sure @entity87 would not have wanted those laws to change			0
" yet it 's not just @entity18 that @entity62 is worried about , since his teammates were bystanders to one of the most appalling incidents in cricketing history			2
after the impact of the ball severed a vertebral artery , prompting a massive bleed into @entity24 ' brain , a number of @entity25 players -- @entity18 included -- rushed to support the batsman 's head after his collapse			1
" they are all in the same boat , " said @entity62 , who shed a tear at @entity24 ' death despite not knowing him			1
" to have been holding their friend in their arms after the incident and then to find out later that he died , it would affect anybody			0
" it 's down to personality as to how they cope			0
