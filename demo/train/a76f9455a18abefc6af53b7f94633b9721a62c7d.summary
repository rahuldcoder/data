-- the lack of a cause of death , a lengthy trial and the possibility that @entity7 's death was accidental were probably factors in the acquittal of her mother , @entity10 , on the most serious charges , according to attorneys and analysts			1
defense attorney @entity15 said he , like many others , was initially surprised by the verdict , which came tuesday after less than 11 hours of deliberations by a @entity20 jury			1
but on reflection , he said , he realized jurors were given a circumstantial case			1
and , @entity15 said , there was no evidence of premeditation by @entity7			1
" she did n't have to kill the child , " he said			0
" her parents would have raised this child			0
" the jury found @entity32 not guilty of first - degree murder and the other most serious charges against her in the 2008 death of @entity7 , 2			1
but it convicted her on four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to law enforcement officers			0
jurors would not immediately comment on their decision			0
they apparently believed @entity32 was involved in an accidental death of her daughter and covered it up , but did not intend to kill her , according to @entity50 defense attorney @entity49			0
" this is a home run for the defense , " the former prosecutor said of the verdict			1
@entity55 , who prosecuted @entity56 in the 1994 drowning deaths of her two little boys , said the jury evidently took the state 's burden of proof seriously			1
" a high - profile case like this is exponentially more pressure on everybody , " said the attorney , who now serves in the @entity65 @entity64			1
@entity56 was convicted of two counts of murder , but @entity65 jurors opted to spare her the death penalty			1
she is serving a life sentence			0
" we do n't want to think mothers do this , " said @entity55 , who was @entity75 solicitor			0
@entity32 's defense attorneys maintained the child drowned in the @entity82 ' above - ground pool july 16 and that @entity32 and her father panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death			1
@entity32 denied that in his testimony			0
alternate juror @entity87 told @entity88 it appeared the @entity32 family did n't know how to deal with a " horrific accident " and that he believed that @entity10 's father , @entity92 , was " hiding something			1
" according to analysts , jurors got past @entity7 's questionable behavior after @entity7 disappeared : the defendant partied at @entity98 nightclubs and participated in a " hot body " contest at one point , according to testimony			1
jurors were able to focus on the evidence , or lack of it , @entity15 said			1
" it is just an extraordinary refutation of the prosecution , " @entity0 legal analyst @entity105 said			0
" @entity7 was convicted of extremely minor crimes , compared with the potential death penalty she faced			1
" @entity105 and @entity112 , an attorney in @entity114 , @entity115 , said they believed that the prosecution overcharged @entity32			0
" this was not a first - degree murder case			2
they should have charged her with more modest crimes and would have had a better chance , " @entity105 said			0
but @entity124 , a criminal defense investigator based in @entity125 , said the prosecution would have looked like it was not confident if it had done so			0
" in a capital case , you are generally going for it all , " @entity124 said , adding he believes the jury closely followed deliberation instructions from @entity130 chief judge @entity129 prosecutors alleged that @entity32 used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious and then duct - taped her mouth and nose to suffocate her			1
they alleged that she put the child 's body in the trunk of her car for a few days before disposing of it			2
forensics testimony centered on odor from the car trunk , garbage , stains and flies			0
@entity87 said he had a difficult time accepting that @entity7 's body had been in the car trunk			1
@entity154 , state attorney for the 9th district , praised the job done by prosecutors but said that proving the case was tough , as @entity7 's remains were skeletal when they were discovered and lacked any chemical evidence			1
" this was a dry - bones case , " @entity154 said			2
" the delay in recovering little @entity7 's remains worked to our considerable disadvantage			1
" jury selection was moved to @entity168 because of extensive publicity surrounding the case in the @entity98 area , and the jurors have been sequestered in an @entity98 hotel for the trial			1
they heard the case over 36 days			2
" you think jurors remember ( all ) that stuff ? " @entity15 asked			0
observers said that both prosecutors and defense attorneys were competent and that the state 's summation against @entity32 was particularly strong			1
@entity55 told @entity0 prosecutors " did what they had to do , " but " your evidence is what it is			2
" prosecutor @entity190 , who also played no role in the trial , told @entity0 's @entity193 he was " shocked and disappointed " with the verdict			1
but , he acknowledged , circumstantial cases like this one " are tough cases when you 're proving a homicide			0
" @entity15 said jurors appeared to take a liking during the trial to @entity201 , who greeted them each day			0
" it got to be where all 12 would in unison say ' good morning ' " in return , @entity15 said			0
although @entity201 was constantly challenged by prosecutors and lost many rulings , jurors saw none of those exchanges , observers said			0
@entity49 said she did n't believe jurors based their verdict on the attorneys			0
" i believe you win the case during the cross-examination of the witnesses , " she said			2
" i do n't think the trial was won or lost on the closings ( summations )			0
" @entity49 said she was not surprised by the verdict			0
she cited the lack of direct evidence , including any incriminating dna found on tape attached to the little girl 's skull			1
forensics evidence , she said , " backfired " on prosecutors			2
" i think that this verdict was the only logical verdict , " prominent defense attorney @entity233 told @entity0 's @entity193			2
" the prosecution woefully fell flat in this case at all times			2
they 're the ones who invested themselves in this guilt - by - character - assassination ... they did n't have actual evidence			2
" @entity124 said the state appeared to have a compelling point in questioning why it took 31 days for @entity32 to go to police if it were an accidental death			2
" that is pretty strong stuff to dispute , " he said			0
but publicity about wrongful convictions and post-conviction exonerations has made jurors increasingly wary in death penalty cases , @entity124 said			0
" jurors do n't want to be part of that mistake when someone 's life is on the line , " he said			2
in the end , observers said , it 's difficult to predict what a jury will do			1
for @entity15 , the verdict showed that the circumstances of @entity7 's fate never came to light			1
" the jury said , ' we do n't know how she died			0

alternate juror questions state 's evidence
