-- last week @entity1 announced that it is closing a serious security vulnerability in the @entity3			1
it used to be that the phone 's encryption only protected a small amount of the data , and @entity1 had the ability to bypass security on the rest of it			1
from now on , all the phone 's data is protected			2
it can no longer be accessed by criminals , governments , or rogue employees			1
access to it can no longer be demanded by totalitarian governments			2
a user 's @entity3 data is now more secure			1
to hear @entity25 law enforcement respond , you 'd think @entity1 's move heralded an unstoppable crime wave			1
see , the @entity28 had been using that vulnerability to get into peoples ' iphones			1
in the words of cyberlaw professor @entity36 , " how is the public interest served by a policy that only thwarts lawful search warrants ? " ah , but that 's the thing : you ca n't build a " back door " that only the good guys can walk through			2
encryption protects against cybercriminals , industrial competitors , the @entity45 secret police and the @entity28			1
you 're either vulnerable to eavesdropping by any of them , or you 're secure from eavesdropping from all of them			2
back - door access built for the good guys is routinely used by the bad guys			2
in 2005 , some unknown group surreptitiously used the lawful - intercept capabilities built into the @entity56 cell phone system			2
the same thing happened in @entity58 in 2006			2
in 2010 , @entity45 hackers subverted an intercept system @entity61 had put into @entity62 to comply with @entity25 government surveillance requests			0
back doors in our cell phone system are currently being exploited by the @entity28 and unknown others			0
this does n't stop the @entity28 and @entity69 from pumping up the fear			0
attorney general @entity71 threatened us with kidnappers and sexual predators			0
the former head of the @entity28 's criminal investigative division went even further , conjuring up kidnappers who are also sexual predators			0
and , of course , terrorists			0
fbi director @entity79 claimed that @entity1 's move allows people to place themselves beyond the law " and also invoked that now overworked " child kidnapper			1
" @entity84 , chief of detectives for the @entity87 police department now holds the title of most hysterical : " @entity1 will become the phone of choice for the pedophile			1
" it 's all bluster			0
of the 3,576 major offenses for which warrants were granted for communications interception in 2013 , exactly one involved kidnapping			1
and , more importantly , there 's no evidence that encryption hampers criminal investigations in any serious way			1
in 2013 , encryption foiled the police nine times , up from four in 2012 -- and the investigations proceeded in some other way			1
this is why the @entity28 's scare stories tend to wither after public scrutiny			0
a former @entity28 assistant director wrote about a kidnapped man who would never have been found without the ability of the @entity28 to decrypt an @entity3 , only to retract the point hours later because it was n't true			1
we 've seen this game before			0
during the crypto wars of the 1990s , fbi director @entity117 and others would repeatedly use the example of mobster @entity121 to illustrate why the ability to tap telephones was so vital			0
but the @entity121 evidence was collected using a room bug , not a telephone tap			0
and those same scary criminal tropes were trotted out then , too			0
back then we called them the @entity129 of the @entity130 : pedophiles , kidnappers , drug dealers , and terrorists			0
strong encryption has been around for years			1
both @entity1 's @entity137 and @entity139 's @entity138 encrypt the data on computer hard drives			1
off - the - record encrypts chat sessions			0
@entity146 everywhere encrypts your browsing			0
@entity150 phones already come with encryption built - in			1
there are literally thousands of encryption products without back doors for sale , and some have been around for decades			1
even if the @entity25 bans the stuff , foreign companies will corner the market because many of us have legitimate needs for security			1
law enforcement has been complaining about " going dark " for decades now			1
in the 1990s , they convinced @entity167 to pass a law requiring phone companies to ensure that phone calls would remain tappable even as they became digital			1
they tried and failed to ban strong encryption and mandate back doors for their use			1
the @entity28 tried and failed again to ban strong encryption in 2010			2
now , in the @entity177 era , they 're about to try again			0
we need to fight this			0
strong encryption protects us from a panoply of threats			2
it protects us from hackers and criminals			2
it protects our businesses from competitors and foreign spies			0
it protects people in totalitarian governments from arrest and detention			0
this is n't just me talking : the @entity28 also recommends you encrypt your data for security			2
as for law enforcement ? the recent decades have given them an unprecedented ability to put us under surveillance and access our data			1
our cell phones provide them with a detailed history of our movements			0
our call records , email history , buddy lists , and @entity214 pages tell them who we associate with			0
the hundreds of companies that track us on the @entity218 tell them what we 're thinking about			0
ubiquitous cameras capture our faces everywhere			0
and most of us back up our @entity3 data on @entity225 , which the @entity28 can still get a warrant for			1
it truly is the golden age of surveillance			0
after considering the issue , @entity36 rethought his position , looking at this in terms of a technological - legal trade - off			0
i think he 's right			0
given everything that has made it easier for governments and others to intrude on our private lives , we need both technological security and legal restrictions to restore the traditional balance between government access and our security / privacy			1
more companies should follow @entity1 's lead and make encryption the easy - to - use default			1
and let 's wait for some actual evidence of harm before we acquiesce to police demands for reduced security .			2

@entity255 : @entity1 closed serious security vulnerability in the @entity3 , enabling wide encryption
he says law enforcement *overreacted* in saying it is a major form of protection for criminals
law enforcement always complains about encryption but is little *stymied* by it , he says
@entity255 : the benefits in protecting privacy far *outweigh* the costs
