@entity0 , @entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 wrapped up his trip to the @entity5 on saturday with a walking tour of the ancient city of @entity0 in @entity0			1
the city 's breathtaking architecture features buildings partly carved into stone cliffs and combines eastern culture with ancient @entity14 constructions			2
it is a @entity16 world heritage site			0
@entity2 was accompanied on a leisurely tour through @entity0 's steep red - rock formations by a @entity20 tourism professor , with all other visitors kept well away -- except for a few stray cats			1
soon after his stroll through the arid landscape , renowned for its colorful interplay of light and shadow , the president headed back to @entity29 , where he arrived saturday night			2
a last - minute success just before departing for @entity0 on friday , @entity2 scored a diplomatic coup when prime minister @entity32 apologized to @entity33 for a 2010 commando raid that killed nine activists on a @entity33 vessel in a @entity38 - bound flotilla			1
@entity39 to @entity33 : sorry for the deadly raid the apology , long sought by @entity33 prime minister @entity42 , eased strained feelings between @entity33 and @entity39 , two vital @entity3 allies in the @entity5			0
it happened in a phone call to @entity42 during a final meeting between @entity2 and @entity32 at an international airport in @entity50 , minutes before @entity45 departed for @entity0 to complete the president 's @entity5 swing			1
@entity2 hailed the development as an important step forward for both countries			0
questions fly around any plan to attack @entity58 @entity60 's refugee influx friday in @entity0 , @entity2 focused on the civil war in neighboring @entity62 , with @entity63 telling reporters that the conflict has already caused 460,000 refugees to flood his country and more are on the way			1
that is equivalent to 10 % of @entity0 's population , and the total could double by the end of the year , the king said			0
he asked for more help from the international community as his country also deals with internal reforms in response to economic woes that are raising public dissatisfaction			0
@entity2 said he was working with @entity80 to provide an additional $ 200 million to @entity0 this year to help deal with the refugee influx , but he remained steadfast in his refusal to pledge @entity3 military assistance to the @entity62 opposition movement			2
refugees flood @entity0 town however , @entity2 repeated past warnings that his stance on military involvement could change if @entity62 uses chemical weapons			1
@entity60 is suffering from refugee fatigue			0
masses of people have fled there from neighboring countries whenever conflict was rife			0
the @entity62 conflict comes on top of the flood of refugees that came from @entity103 just a decade ago			2
the country is a close @entity3 ally and has been one of the most stable in the region , but it has seen recent internal turmoil and discontent			0
@entity63 has a reputation for benevolence , unlike autocratic rulers such as @entity62 's @entity113 or deposed @entity103 dictator @entity114			1
one house of the @entity60 parliament is democratically elected			0
however , a weak economy and allegations of corruption by public officials have stoked dissatisfaction with him			0
in november , crowds took to the streets calling for @entity63 's downfall because of rising gasoline prices			2
more recently , comments attributed to @entity63 in the @entity128 caused further anger toward the monarch , who was quoted as calling the opposition @entity131 a " masonic cult " and referring to tribal elders in his country as " old dinosaurs			0
" the royal court says some of @entity63 's comments in the magazine were taken out of context by local @entity60 and international media outlets who reported on the article			1
courting @entity39 in @entity39 , the last - minute diplomacy added a flourish to @entity2 's first visit to the jewish state as president			1
while the two nations have a key strategic partnership , with the @entity3 supplying military aid and diplomatic support as @entity39 's most vital ally , @entity2 and @entity32 had famously frosty relations during the president 's first term			1
with both beginning new terms after @entity2 's reelection last year and @entity32 's recent formation of a new government , the president 's visit was an opportunity to reset the relationship and signal unified positions on major issues such as the @entity5 peace process and @entity58 's efforts to develop a nuclear weapon			1
@entity2 and @entity32 met several times during the president 's three days in @entity39 , which also included a state dinner where @entity39 president @entity172 awarded him the country 's highest civilian honor			1
before leaving @entity39 , @entity2 paid tribute to the father of modern @entity177 in a symbolic visit to @entity180 's grave			2
joined by @entity172 , @entity32 and @entity181 , @entity2 also visited the grave of former prime minister @entity183 , who was assassinated in 1995			1
@entity2 placed a stone at each grave from the grounds of the @entity188 memorial in @entity29 in a gesture to link the @entity191 - @entity3 struggle for freedom with the struggle by the @entity39 people for a homeland			1
the president also visited the @entity198 memorial @entity199 , where he turned up the " eternal flame " of remembrance of the millions of @entity203 victims of @entity205 death camps in @entity206 fairness for the @entity208 in @entity39 , @entity2 urged young @entity39 in a speech to pressure their leaders to seek peace with @entity208			0
he asked @entity39 to empathize with the plight of @entity208 , and he drew applause when he criticized the @entity39 government 's controversial policy of building new settlements in disputed territories			0
walking through @entity219 and @entity38 , political differences become real during a visit with @entity222 in @entity219 , in the @entity220 , @entity2 stressed the need for direct talks between @entity39 and @entity208 for a two - state solution			1
" the @entity208 people deserve an end to occupation and the daily indignities that come with it , " he said at a news conference with @entity222 , adding that @entity208 deserve " a future of hope " and a " state of their own			0
" @entity222 said the @entity39 settlements are " more than a hurdle to peace , " calling them illegal and saying it was @entity39 's duty to stop building them			2
he envisioned a @entity208 state based on 1967 borders with @entity244 as capital -- a scenario unacceptable to @entity39			0
@entity1 's @entity247 and @entity248 reported @entity0 , and @entity1 's @entity249 contributed to this report from @entity29			2
@entity1 's @entity251 wrote the story in @entity253 .			0

@entity181 will meet with @entity32 and @entity222 , a @entity256 official says
