-- " hello , @entity1 ! " @entity2 called out to her hometown 's swanky new @entity3 early on in her three - plus hour concert			1
the last time she did a solo show in @entity1 , she told the cheering crowd , was when she was 8 and singing on a stoop on @entity9			1
remember that , she asked her brother who was in the audience ? ( in case you 're wondering , he scored good seats , not great			2
) she looked singularly streisandly , in a shiny black number that had enough sheer to show off those famous legs			1
" you like the dress ? " she asked the crowd			2
" good ! @entity20 ! " she complimented a member of the audience who must have been wearing a souvenir shirt			2
" did you buy it in the shop ? " she asked			2
" it 's cheaper online			2
" in other words , not much new material to be had tonight			0
but who wanted it ? certainly not concertgoers @entity33 ( who spent the intermission on her cell phone trying to find her friend 's seat ) , @entity38 , or @entity39 ( clad in a very @entity40 - meets - @entity42 ensemble )			1
despite waking up with a cold ( " i 'm drinking chicken soup " she told the crowd of what she was sipping in her mug that sat next to â € ” of course â € ” a vase of roses ) , @entity2 impressively powered through " @entity52 , " " @entity53 , " and " @entity54			1
" sometimes her voice sounded strained , but more often the rasp worked for her			0
her tribute to composer @entity58 , who recently passed away , managed to be extremely touching , even as she read scripted lines off a teleprompter			1
she honored him with a mashup of " @entity63 " and the completely awesome and underappreciated theme to @entity65			0
who knew @entity58 wrote that ? also , look out for the roses , @entity69 ! when @entity2 was n't singing or sipping chicken soup , there were other people to keep our ears busy			1
a lot of other people			0
first , @entity77 came out to remind us that @entity79 does n't have the monopoly on young @entity82 tenors			0
then hottie trumpet player @entity83 came out and jammed with the drummer			0
finally , @entity2 's son @entity85 showed up for some awkward banter ( " she likes to touch my hair , " he told the audience ) and a solo song			1
yes , @entity85 got to sing a solo song to thousands of people , though i 'm not entirely sure he 'd make it through @entity95 week on @entity96			0
" i am so proud of him , " beamed his mama			0
fans got to ask questions and we now know that @entity2 likes smooth and all natural peanut butter , instead of chunky and chemical - filled			1
other than that , she repeated her already - used " i hope no one tells [ @entity105 ] how to get to @entity106 or @entity107 " line			2
she also told the crowd she does n't sing @entity111 songs			0
come on , there 's only so much of @entity1 she can embrace			1
