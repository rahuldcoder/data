-- one half @entity2 , the other @entity4 , they are the most talked - about partnership in tennis			1
dubbed " the @entity16 , " @entity7 and @entity8 hope to end their breakthrough year with a showdown at the infamous @entity13 border that divides their countries			1
@entity7 , an @entity2 @entity17 , and @entity8 , a @entity18 also aged 30 , reached their first major doubles final at the @entity20 in september and climbed to eighth in the world rankings			1
yet their work off the court has attracted just as much attention as they try to soften the often - fractious relationship between their two nations since partition in 1947			2
the pair have been honored with a string of awards for their humanitarian work in the past 12 months , and are determined to start picking up tournament titles in 2011			1
can champion duo 's reunion spark an @entity2 tennis boom ? but a showpiece clash at the notorious border crossing that hosts a nightly pageant between @entity2 and @entity4 's border forces would be the perfect way to carry their " @entity46 , @entity47 " campaign into the new year			1
" we 're thinking how to get to a wider audience and spread the message of peace through our partnership and thought , " @entity8 told @entity0 's @entity48			0
" how about playing a match at the @entity13 border , with @entity7 playing on the @entity4 side and me on the @entity2 side for a gesture of friendship ? " at the @entity20 the ambassadors to the @entity62 for @entity4 and @entity2 both came to watch the semifinals and finals			1
that was a huge deal because normally you do n't see two diplomats cheering for one cause -- it was a really positive sign			0
i just hope in the near future we can have that match at the border , that would be great			0
" the village of @entity13 , near the @entity2 city of @entity77 and the @entity4 city of @entity79 , is the only road border crossing between the two countries , and the daily ceremony -- which includes a lot of strutting , stamping and saluting -- regularly attracts a crowd of thousands			1
a match there could be a watershed moment for a pairing that first emerged in 2003 but did not make a major impact until this season			0
their burgeoning partnership on court is allied to a deep - rooted desire to strengthen links between two countries which have a long and deep distrust of each other			1
" we 're both brand ambassadors for an organization called @entity101 , " @entity7 said			0
" right now we 're trying to see if we can help tennis in both our countries , promote it and keep the sport growing as much as we can			0
" as well as receiving the @entity107 award at the recent @entity108 in @entity109 , they were also given the @entity110 for 2010 at a glittering ceremony in @entity112			0
the citation read : " their commitment to promoting peace between the two countries and their conviction that peace was possible was shown amply during the year			0
" @entity120 , president of the @entity121 , added of the proposed @entity13 match : " the sport is ready for peace			0
will the two governments rise to the occasion ? " their partnership may have attracted plenty of headlines but for @entity8 , teaming up with his @entity2 counterpart made perfect sense			1
" i 've been playing with @entity2 players ever since i started playing tennis , " he said			2
" unfortunately there are not that many @entity4 on the tour , and playing with an @entity2 was actually the most natural thing that came to me -- having the same language , most of the time having the same dinner , @entity2 or @entity4 foods in the evening			2
" the first time i ever traveled to @entity2 when i was 16 , i was one of the top [ @entity4 ] juniors and he was one of the top juniors in @entity2 and that 's how i got to know him			2
" knowing his attacking style of play , i always knew if we played together we 'd be able to make a really good impact			0
i think results clearly show in that way i was right , though normally he tells me that i am always wrong ! " as well as their run to the final of the @entity20 , where they were beaten by the @entity159 brothers from @entity160 , they also enjoyed success at @entity162 which made them household names back home			2
" this year we made the quarterfinal at @entity162 and that was very , very big in @entity4 , " @entity8 said			1
" i 've always told him i think he 's the most popular @entity2 guy in @entity4 this year ! " i can thank him enough for that because obviously without him i would n't have been able to achieve all those goals , and with him being my best friend on the tour it makes it the icing on the cake			2
it 's been a great journey so far			0
