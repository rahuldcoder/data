-- @entity2 's 5 - year - old son may not be able to write his name yet , but he can tell you if your shoes are ratchet			1
ok , that 's not really true , but it 's funny , which is the point of @entity2 's @entity11 persona , @ @entity12 : to use humor to normalize the concept of gay parenting and show mainstream @entity16 that " gay is ok			1
" " i think when people are uncertain or uncomfortable about something , humor is the best way to break down some of those barriers , and gay parenting is definitely a new concept to a lot of people , " he said			1
not long ago , @entity2 was a fairly normal gay man working in fashion			1
then he moved to @entity29 with his partner , adopted their son , @entity31 , and became a stay - at - home dad			0
that 's when he transformed from a " bitchy gay guy " to a " bitchy gay dad " and began deploying sardonic wit in 140 characters on timely topics in parenting , pop culture and politics			1
@entity2 launched the @entity11 persona in 2012 in response to what he perceived as " a significant lack " of gay fathers in the media and pop culture , except for @entity46 on " @entity47			1
" to riff on the gay dad stereotype , he started @ @entity12 as both a " self - deprecating joke " and a way to encourage gay youth to be comfortable in their skin			2
it took off , thanks to the compelling username and outlandish comments such as " when my kid scrapes his knee , he gets a @entity69 band - aid , " or " as if i 'm going to ruin his hair using s * * * * y tears - free shampoo			0
" " i thought ' what 's funnier than an outlandishly crazy , lewd gay dad ? ' and literally there 's nothing , " he said			2
he also wants to put out the message to the gay community that being a gay parent does n't mean you have to be a perfect parent			2
" gay parents are expected to behave a certain way , because heaven forbid we mess this up , and i think that 's bulls * * *			2
i am definitely a lot more cautious now that i 'm a parent , but i still am the same person i was before having a kid			0
" his 81,000 followers seem to like his style , engaging in his musings on such topics as marriage equality , the ice bucket challenge and some of his favorite performers			1
and his range is growing , with a @entity98 channel and a feature on the " today " show			0
he also really likes " @entity104 , " especially @entity101 , whose presence imbues much of his time line			0
but @ @entity12 is an online persona , he says			0
the real @entity2 is a lot less brassy and flamboyant			1
" my sense of humor is still sharp and inappropriate , but i do n't walk around with resting bitch face , " he said			0
he 's gay , but he 's a father first and foremost â€” on @entity11 and in real life			1
" there is nothing like the relationship i have with my son , and i love him more than anything on this planet , " he said			0
" once we adopted him , i had to relinquish a lot of my selfish ways , and that was very cathartic and healthy			0
he constantly makes me want to be a better person and a better father			0

@entity2 is the " gay at @entity128 " on @entity11 , and his feed is a hoot
@entity2 has *amassed* 81,000 followers with his *acerbic* posts on culture and fatherhood
he uses humor to normalize the concept of gay parenting
