-- @entity1 has a reputation for being one of @entity5 's most expensive cities			1
@entity0 hits the streets of the fashionable capital and proves otherwise			2
@entity1 's @entity8 9:00 a.m. i plot my day over a complimentary breakfast of homemade yogurt and knäckebröd ( crispy bread ) at @entity13 1647 ( 3 @entity14 ; 46 - 8/442 - 1680 ) , housed in a former tobacco and clothing factory in the hip island neighborhood of @entity18			1
my room ( $ 170 ) , no. 21 , is small and peaceful , with rustic pine floors , an antique crystal chandelier , and , thankfully , blackout drapes -- essential in a city that gets 18 hours of sunlight a day in the summer			0
10:00 a.m. the hotel is around the corner from @entity27 , one of @entity1 's most seductive shopping strips			0
though it feels a little early to start spending , i ca n't resist a jar of cloudberry honey ( $ 6 ) from @entity34 ( 37 @entity27 ; 46 - 8/641 - 9190 ) , a store that specializes in handmade items by visually impaired artisans			1
i crave almost everything i see in @entity39 ( 31 @entity27 , 46 - 8/462 - 3520 ) , which carries an eclectic range of accessories by @entity43 designers , including hand - printed dish towels and colorful kids ' toys			1
but i force myself to move along			0
12:00 p.m. for lunch , i circle back to busy @entity49 square -- @entity1 's answer to @entity51			1
the main attraction here ( besides a major subway stop ) is the humble @entity55 ( fried herring ) wagon , encircled by picnic tables crowded with locals on their lunch breaks			1
i sidle up and order the signature dish ( $ 6.25 ) topped with a dollop of crème fraîche			0
from my bench , i can see the silhouette of @entity66 , the old section of the city just across the bridge			0
1:00 p.m. down along the harbor , a freckled blond girl at a candy cart snips off a sample of her salt licorice ( free ) , a delicious flavor called @entity71 -- " scream of the witch , " she translates			0
after a short stroll past the steamboats and @entity82 mansions of @entity83 , i arrive at the @entity84 ( 14 @entity85 ; 46 - 8/5195 - 4800 ) , a maritime museum built around a meticulously reconstructed boat that was shipwrecked in the 17th century			1
i buy a ticket ( $ 15 ) and explore the gigantic ship , feeling a little like an extra on the set of " @entity90			0
" 3:30 p.m. risking museum burnout , i head to the galleries ( $ 12.50 admission ) of the @entity94 ( @entity95 ; 46 - 8/5195 - 5200 ) , designed by the @entity97 architect @entity96 , to see its collection of 20th - century @entity5 and @entity101 art. here , i discover the contemporary @entity43 painter @entity102 , whose lush , layered paintings look like dreamscapes			1
i also find one of the city 's best photo ops -- the panoramic view of the port from the glass - walled museum café			1
5:00 p.m. i forgo a pricey taxi ride across the city in favor of an infinitely more charming and scenic walk toward @entity66 , which is touristy but irresistible once i 'm weaving through a knot of cobblestoned streets and storybook 17th - century houses			1
my reward is a hot chocolate ( $ 4.70 ) at @entity120 ( 18 - 20 @entity121 ; 46 - 8/203 - 170 ) , a candlelit cellar with tea - stained walls and low vaulted ceilings			2
7:00 p.m. while wandering the alleys of @entity66 , i stumble upon what may be the city 's top bargain : a classical music concert ( $ 11 ) at @entity130 , @entity1 's central cathedral ( 1 @entity131 , @entity66 ; 46 - 8/723 - 3016 )			2
i take a seat in a wooden pew as a local pianist fills the space with the music of @entity138			0
@entity140 evening light filters in through leaded glass windows and shimmers off the golden angels on the high brick ceiling			0
9:30 p.m. the lingering sunlight has affected my eating schedule , but i 'm finally hungry again			0
on the patio of @entity148 ( 4 @entity149 ; 46 - 8/640 - 8083 ) , surrounded by chattering clusters of young fashion plates and artist types , i wrap myself in one of the restaurant 's green fleece blankets and gobble down a late dinner of potatoes and röding ( $ 25.80 ) , a local fish			2
from my barstool , i watch skinny blond skateboarders dip and sail around a cement half - pipe in the adjacent park , and revel in a priceless travel high : the giddy feeling of having discovered the coolest place in town			2
total spent : $ 251.25 e-mail to a friend planning a beach getaway ? do n't miss @entity0 's guide to @entity173			0
