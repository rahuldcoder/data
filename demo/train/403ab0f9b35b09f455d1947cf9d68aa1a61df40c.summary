-- my son @entity1 died two and a half years ago from neuroblastoma , a common childhood cancer , after suffering through multiple surgeries , chemotherapy injections and painful radiation therapy			1
these treatments ( while standard for this type of cancer ) were so barbaric and horrifying i would not wish them on my worst enemy			2
nor would i wish him or her to have to live with the image of their child experiencing their gruesome side effects			0
@entity1 was just 5 years old			1
he left behind my wife @entity19 and i , a heartbroken twin brother named @entity21 and his loving big sister @entity22			2
our family has been devastated by this loss			0
i miss my son every second of every day			2
by talking to many other parents who have lost children to childhood cancer , i have come to understand that this pain will last until i am gone			1
a week before @entity1 died in our arms , he looked up at me and said , " i 'm not going to grow up to be or do anything			1
" can you imagine hearing your child speak such words ? fighting back tears , i promised my son he would do " something big " someday			1
for two years now i have been fighting around the clock to fulfill my promise to my son			2
i do this in hopes that greater awareness will lead to desperately needed funding and research , so children can receive more humane treatments and have a better chance of survival , with fewer future complications			2
pediatric cancer kills more kids in the @entity54 than any other disease			2
and more than 11,000 children are diagnosed with cancer each year			2
yet the @entity57 devotes just 4 % of its budget toward pediatric cancer research			0
surely these statistics speak of the dire need for increased funding to fight pediatric cancer			0
i began my mission to increase childhood cancer awareness in august 2012			1
my dream was to see as much gold in september for @entity68 as there is pink in october for @entity71			0
the awareness generated by the breast cancer community has led to earlier detection , newer and improved treatments , and higher survival rates for those fighting breast cancer			1
i just wanted the same for kids fighting cancer			0
i started reaching out to officials at bridges , buildings and landmarks across the @entity54 , asking that they light gold in september to help increase awareness			1
i was successful in getting many to agree : the @entity87 , the @entity88 and the @entity89 in @entity90 ; the battleship @entity91 and the @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95			0
many others across the @entity54 began to reach out to structures in their hometowns			0
our movement to go gold in september even took root in countries such as @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
last year , there was more gold displayed in september across the world than ever before , and we are just beginning			0
please display gold this september to help shed light on the monster that afflicts so many of our children			1
lighting gold is the first step toward greater awareness of childhood cancer -- awareness that will hopefully lead to increased funding , which will lead to more research , that will hopefully lead to a cure for all types of childhood cancer			1
but there is another reason to light gold : it helps to heal the hearts of parents such as myself who have lost children to cancer			1
it lets us know our children did not die in vain			0
it shows us our kids are not forgotten			0
my son received most of his treatments at @entity143 at @entity143 in @entity90			0
after my son died , i had a difficult time going back to @entity90 ; there were too many painful memories there			1
but last september , i returned to see many of the landmarks we had crossed and passed by so often illuminated with gold lights			0
i smiled , with tears streaming down my cheeks , looking at the buildings and bridges shining gold and thought : you are doing " something big " @entity1 !			1
