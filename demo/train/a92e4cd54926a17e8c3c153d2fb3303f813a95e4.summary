editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity5 ) -- in 2007 , we stood on the @entity19 side of the @entity20 , where we tried and failed to get into the @entity21			1
inside , a @entity23 civil war was taking place , pitting political and philosophical rivals @entity26 and @entity27 against each other			2
after a succession of assassinations , kidnappings and street battles , @entity26 took complete control of @entity21 , and for the first time in its history , had to figure out how to run a government			1
in 2011 , when the @entity38 government of @entity39 decided to start letting small numbers of folks into @entity21 through their @entity43 crossing , we knew it was our chance to finally get a rare glimpse of the embattled @entity21 and to see what life was like under the rule of @entity26			1
much of @entity26 ' popularity within @entity21 comes from the fact that they are seen as incorruptible , and when they took power they put a concerted effort into stomping out all forms of vice in on their turf			1
but the same tunnels that allow @entity26 to smuggle in weapons from @entity39 also allow for a steady flow of drugs			1
when we met the members of the @entity26 vice cops , they were eager to show off their " trophy case " which held a wide assortment of some of the drugs and paraphernalia they 've confiscated on raids on homes around the @entity21			1
skull - shaped bongs , cocaine , hash , even tall - boy cans of @entity39 beer ... they had it all			0
but what stood out among all the standard illicit drugs was one called @entity80			0
this prescription painkiller has become the drug of choice for young people looking to escape the reality of life in @entity21 , something we witnessed during an evening stroll through @entity91 's central park			1
see the rest of @entity93 in the @entity21 combine the widespread tramadol with @entity26 ' strict approach to law and order , and soon you have a lot of young men behind bars			1
we visited @entity21 's central prison , where drug users and drug smugglers alike are locked in a communal cell , their sentences ranging anywhere from one month , to death by hanging			2
elsewhere in the same facility we met a woman who was imprisoned for the crime of having a child out of wedlock and another for helping her son escape from @entity21			0
@entity26 ' firm hand seems to have resulted in a kind of orderliness that is not often seen in places that are as impoverished as @entity21			2
but it is order with a distinctly authoritarian flavor			0
the @entity26 government operates in an environment of paranoia that has them on guard not only against the outside world , but against their brothers and sisters in @entity27 , and against ordinary @entity133 whose poverty they fear could tempt them into spying for @entity19			0
an authoritarian government operating within prison walls and under economic siege ... it sounds like the setup for a @entity141 movie , except that it 's real .			0

@entity5 gets a rare glimpse inside the @entity21 to see what life is like under @entity26 rule
