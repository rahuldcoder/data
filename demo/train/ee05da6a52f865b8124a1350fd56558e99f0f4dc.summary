-- there 's a $ 33 million prize on offer -- but @entity5 's hopes of securing the cash are on the line			1
a goalless draw in @entity9 against @entity10 in the first leg of its @entity13 playoff means the pressure will be cranked up another level when the two teams face up at @entity17 next wednesday			1
reduced to 10 - men following the sending off of @entity19 , @entity5 will hope it can successfully see off a plucky @entity10 side and secure a 15th successive season in the group stage of @entity24 's top club competition			1
@entity5 had won all 12 of its previous playoff matches in the competition but @entity27 remains confident his side will progress and secure a healthy financial reward			2
" it was a difficult game played at a frenetic pace throughout , " @entity27 told @entity30			0
" we could have won it but they had chances as well			0
in the end we did n't lose and hopefully we will make it at home			0
" both yellow cards for @entity19 are unbelievable			2
when you see the fouls they have made today it 's not serious			0
" @entity19 's sending off , which came late on following a second yellow card , rules the midfielder out of next week 's second leg			1
and yet @entity5 still could have snatched victory with five minutes remaining when @entity51 's effort hit the post			2
aiming for a place in the group stage following last year 's last - 16 exit , @entity5 made a slow start and could have fallen behind inside the first minute			2
@entity57 , the former @entity58 and @entity59 forward , struck an effort straight from the kickoff which smashed against the crossbar			0
@entity57 then went close again , forcing @entity5 goalkeeper @entity63 into a sharp save with an ambitious volley			2
@entity5 , which left it late to win its opening @entity67 game of the season against @entity69 on saturday , appeared to struggle with the poor quality of the playing surface			0
both @entity72 and @entity73 wasted decent openings , while @entity57 fired just wide after running in behind the @entity5 defense			0
the second half , while just as frenetic , failed to provide a goal with neither side able to convert their chances			0
@entity80 wasted @entity10 ' best opportunity , curling his effort wide of the far post after he had worked his way into the @entity5 penalty area			1
with the game becoming ever more fractious , @entity19 was shown his second yellow card to leave @entity5 a man down for the remaining 10 minutes of the contest			1
but it was the visitors who came closest to snatching a dramatic victory when @entity92 weaved his way past a couple of challenges before lashing his effort against the post			0
elsewhere , @entity98 came from behind to claim a 1 - 1 draw against @entity100			1
@entity101 gave the visiting side a first - half lead before @entity104 leveled for the home side			0
in @entity107 , @entity106 was beaten 3 - 2 by @entity108 despite having taken the lead on two separate occasions			1
in the night 's other games , @entity111 defeated @entity113 2 - 1 and @entity114 saw off @entity115 1 - 0 .			1

@entity5 finish with 10 - men in 0 - 0 draw at @entity10
@entity19 sent off and will miss second leg
@entity98 held 1 - 1 by @entity100
@entity108 defeats @entity106 3 - 2 in @entity107
