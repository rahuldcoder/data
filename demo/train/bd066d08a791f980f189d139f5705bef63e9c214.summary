-- when she gets a look at the latest list on @entity5 , @entity1 wo n't be smiling anymore			2
the magazine ranked her first on its list of " @entity10 's @entity9 , " reporting that her films only bring in 40 cents for every dollar she is paid as an actress -- and that 's without taking into account the fall tv bust " @entity17 , " on which @entity1 served as an executive producer			1
@entity19 had the unenviable fate of taking second place , though his return ( $ 2.70 for every dollar he 's paid ) was significantly higher than @entity1 's			1
while the jury is still out whether " @entity27 " ( opening today ) and his stint as @entity30 host will bring @entity19 the gold in 2012 , his fate for 2011 is sealed			1
see what other big names made the list after the jump			0
for this list , @entity5 analyzed @entity10 's 40 top - earning actors and their respective compensation for their starring roles in the last five years and compared it to the operating income on those films			2
@entity42 ( # 6 ) might be the person on the list who is simultaneously the most predictable and unexpected entrant			1
as a go - to guy for huge action flicks , it seems like he 'd generate healthy revenue stream			0
then you remember his recent films include " @entity51 , " " @entity52 , " and more recently " trespass , " which earned a paltry $ 16,000 in its first weekend			2
yes , friends , that 's roughly the going rate for a @entity57			0
@entity42 's " trespass " co-star @entity58 also did n't fare well , landing in tenth place			1
her ex @entity60 -- another tentpole action star with a questionable ability to return on his asking price -- took ninth place , though perhaps december 's " mission : impossible " -- ghost protocol can turn things around for him next year			2
it was a tough year for funnymen , as @entity72 ( # 3 ) , @entity73 ( # 7 ) , and @entity74 ( # 8 ) all landed in the top 10			0
a silver lining for @entity72 : he took first place in 2009 and 2010 , so dropping to third is actually an improvement			0
@entity58 and @entity42 's fellow @entity30 winners @entity81 and @entity82 rounded out the pack in fourth and fifth place , respectively			1
perhaps it was less of a surprise for @entity81 , whom @entity5 also ranked in this year 's list of highest - paid actresses			1
she brought back $ 3.55 for every dollar she was paid			0
it seems even the high - profile fan draw of co-star @entity93 in april 's " @entity94 " could n't bring her back from romcom flop " @entity96			1
