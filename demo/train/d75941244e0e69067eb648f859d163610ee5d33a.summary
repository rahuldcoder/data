-- @entity1 became @entity3 's most decorated @entity2 of all time after his victory in the men 's keirin took his tally to six gold medals			1
@entity1 fought off a late charge from @entity12 's @entity11 in the final sprint to cross the line first and then confirmed he is " 99.9 % " certain never to race in the @entity15 again			1
the 36 - year - old was roared home by a vociferous crowd in the @entity19 to complete a dream games for @entity21 who won seven of the 10 track cycling gold medals on offer			1
earlier in the day @entity26 added to the gold she won in the women 's team pursuit with triumph in the omnium event , but home crowd favorite @entity32 was beaten to gold by @entity35 @entity34 in the individual sprint			1
follow the action on day eleven with our @entity39 live blog " i 'm in shock , you try and compose yourself but it 's surreal , " @entity1 told the host broadcaster after the race			1
" i wanted to win gold in front of my home crowd			2
i saw everyone stepping up to the plate and thankfully it worked out for me too			0
" the keirin is a lottery and you never take anything for granted in it			0
i ca n't describe the feelings i have at the moment			0
this is enough for me , this is the perfect end to my @entity15 career			0
" i ca n't put into words what it means to me			0
it 's one of the greatest feelings i have ever had			0
i 'm 99.9 % sure i wo n't be competing in @entity67 -- how can you top this ? " @entity70 ( for the 2014 @entity71 ) is another question , as that would be the dream ending for me			0
" @entity1 took the lead with two laps to go and though @entity11 briefly overtook him on the back straight , the @entity77 responded to power ahead and take the line			2
he has now eclipsed the five gold medals won by rower @entity81 to become @entity3 's most successful ever @entity2			1
behind @entity1 and @entity11 , @entity84 's @entity83 and @entity86 @entity85 could not be split by a photo finish and were both awarded bronze medals			1
in the women 's individual sprint final @entity34 gained revenge for defeat in the same event four years ago , as @entity32 had to settle for silver in her last race before retiring			1
but though the @entity35 won the best of three final 2 - 0 , it was a race tinged with controversy			2
@entity32 thought she had won the first leg by 0.001 of a second , only to be disqualified by the judges for straying out of the sprint lane			2
her coaches argued @entity34 had nudged into her , forcing the mistake but the decision stood			2
she was also disqualified from the women 's team sprint on thursday			1
in the second sprint @entity32 went off early but ran out of power as @entity34 surged past her to add another gold to the one she won in @entity111			1
it denied @entity32 a fairytale ending to a career in which she won two gold medals , including the women 's keirin at the @entity118			1
" i 'm so relieved and overwhelmed with emotion			0
i would have loved to have won on my final race but i 'm so glad it 's all done and i can move on , " she said			0
" i think @entity34 is the best rider of the field and it is the way it should have been , @entity34 and myself in the final , she 's a fantastic competitor			2
but i 'm very glad to be saying that 's the last time i 'm going to go through that			0
" i was really annoyed ( at being relegated ) because i 'm sure she touched me and it caused me to move up			0
i ca n't believe twice in the competition i 've been disqualified and relegated , it 's unheard of			0
" prior to @entity133 's farewell race , 20 - year - old @entity26 secured her second gold in her first ever @entity15 by winning the multi-discipline women 's omnium event			1
she set a new @entity15 record in the the 500m time trial event to beat @entity140 @entity139 and add to the gold she won in the women 's team pursuit			1
" i ca n't believe this has happened to me , " she said			0
" i 'm peaking at the right time and it 's all thanks to the coaches , and the support of the crowd and my family			0
