@entity0 -- as members of @entity4 point to problems with @entity6 , lawmakers are scrambling and , in and some cases , sparking cries of hypocrisy over how they 'll handle one piece of @entity12 under their control : whether their own staff members should be forced into the exchanges			1
members of @entity4 have until the end of the day on thursday to make up their minds , and @entity18 and @entity19 are divided internally on the politically tricky issue			1
" we just learned ( monday ) that we have to make the decision this week , " one @entity21 @entity19 leadership aide told @entity1			0
@entity24 foreign relations chairman @entity23 , @entity25 , told @entity1 on tuesday , " i 'm not sure where we 're at			0
" his staff was still unsure of his decision on wednesday night			2
meantime , despite @entity18 ' defense of @entity12 and @entity19 insistence that members of @entity4 and their staff should directly experience the law they passed , some powerful lawmakers plan to exempt their workers from the requirement that they enter the exchanges			1
example ? @entity39 chairman @entity38 wants to keep his entire staff -- committee and personal office -- out of the exchanges , according to a @entity21 @entity19 aide familiar with his thinking			1
the aide defended the idea as consistent , saying @entity38 believes that no @entity46 should have to enter @entity12 exchanges			1
interpreting the law and if lawmakers do nothing by the deadline thursday night , committee staff and leadership staff will be automatically exempted due to an interpretation by congressional administrators			1
part of the issue involves semantics and how @entity4 wrote the law			1
the @entity60 mandates that " members of @entity4 and congressional staff " must get health care through an @entity12 exchange			1
but the @entity65 has ruled that it 's up to individual members to designate which of their workers are " congressional staff			1
" most assume a member 's " personal " or district staff fit the definition			2
but there is a messy disagreement over what should happen with the more than 2,000 people who work for committees or leadership offices			0
some argue those workers are n't as directly tied to individual members			2
others insist that argument is just a giant loophole for staffers who are nervous and want to avoid the exchanges			2
but put aside the question of logic -- the bottom line is that each member of @entity4 can do what he or she wants			1
exempted by default and if lawmakers do n't act , many staffers will be exempted by default			1
an internal administrative policy provides that committee and leadership staff will be exempted from the exchange automatically , according to a @entity24 aide and an internal @entity21 e-mail obtained by @entity1			1
the @entity21 e-mail , sent by the chamber 's chief administrative officer ( @entity105 ) monday , said that office is interpreting " congressional staff " to mean individuals who are paid from the members ' individual office budgets , not leadership or committee funds			1
that gives some members their justification			2
" the committees are exempted ( from the exchange requirement ) , " @entity117 sen. @entity116 , the ranking @entity19 on the @entity118 , insisted to @entity1			0
because of @entity116 's view , his committee staff members can keep their current federal employee health plan			1
" i think it 's clear , " @entity116 said			0
but what some call clear , others see as self - serving or hypocritical			0
" i would submit that 's ludicrous on its face , " sen. @entity128 , @entity129 , said of the committee exemption argument on the floor on wednesday			0
" congressional staff are congressional staff			0
... anyone who works for us through the institution of @entity4			2
" on the other side , sen. @entity140 of @entity141 , the top @entity19 on the @entity142 , told @entity1 on tuesday that he thinks " we 're going to keep the committee staff " on the current federal employee plan			1
" i have n't made up my mind , " @entity140 said			0
@entity149 chairman @entity148 , @entity150 , will have her leadership and committee staff go into the exchange			0
but what about fellow @entity157 and @entity156 chairman @entity155 of @entity158 ? his office says he believes committee staff is exempt			0
the issue is a double - edged sword for lawmakers : exempt your staff and face accusations of granting them a special privilege or force your staff into the exchanges and risk losing good workers who fear the exchanges will provide weaker or costlier benefits			1
last - minute decisions many of the most powerful waited until this week to make the tough decision			0
@entity21 @entity19 leaders were still discussing options on tuesday			0
then by wednesday , speaker @entity179 and his top lieutenants decided to put their leadership staff into the exchanges , according to spokesmen for the various leaders			2
@entity24 @entity18 leaders may be less united			0
while @entity188 and @entity18 whip @entity189 , @entity190 , are both forcing their entire staff into the exchanges , @entity24 leader @entity187 's office did not answer @entity1 's questions about his plan			1
as for staffers themselves , feelings about joining the exchanges range from " meh " to sharp anxiety			0
none would speak on the record with @entity1 , saying they were not authorized to discuss their opinions with reporters			0
but several aides said they were extremely nervous about the exchange idea because it was untried			0
one indicated he had started thinking of looking for a new job because of the predicament			0
others insisted they either had not thought about the exchange idea much or felt that it would be similar to the federal health plan they have now			2
to try to and guarantee a plan equal to current federal benefits , the @entity65 requires that congressional staffers in the exchange buy a plan at the " gold " benefit level or above			2
the same rule also mandates that congressional staffers use the @entity0 , health exchange to find a plan			0
those rules will apply to some staffers and not others , depending on how individual members of @entity4 decide , one - by - one .			1

some members of @entity4 *undecided* on which staff will go into @entity12 exchanges
the way the law is written creates some *ambiguity* in which staff members are affected
if lawmakers fail to act , their staff members are automatically exempted and keep federal plan
