-- for gen. @entity1 , thursday 's move to open combat units in the @entity5 military to women had its roots nearly a decade ago , on the streets of @entity9			1
@entity1 took command of the @entity12 's @entity11 in june 2003 , when @entity14 insurgents were starting to target @entity5 troops with sniper fire , grenades and roadside bombs			1
as he prepared for a trip outside his headquarters , he took a moment to introduce himself to the crew of his humvee			0
" i slapped the turret gunner on the leg and i said , ' who are you ? ' and she leaned down and said , i 'm @entity29			2
' and i said , ' ah , ok , ' " @entity1 told reporters at the @entity31			0
opinion : will infantry men accept women as peers ? " so , female turret - gunner protecting division commander			1
it 's from that point on that i realized something had changed , and it was time to do something about it			2
" thursday , @entity1 -- now chairman of the @entity46 -- sat alongside defense secretary @entity47 as both men signed a directive that will open front - line posts to the roughly 200,000 women now serving in the active - duty military			1
@entity47 said the move is a bow to reality on the battlefield , where women in what are technically non-combat units already find themselves fighting alongside their male comrades			1
single mom fought alongside combat troops in @entity63 " the fact is , they have become an integral part of our ability to perform our mission , and for more than a decade of war they have demonstrated courage and skill and patriotism , " @entity47 said			1
women made up 67 of the nearly 3,500 @entity5 lost in hostile fire in @entity77 and 33 of the 1,700 - plus killed in combat in @entity63 ; more than 600 in @entity77 and 300 in @entity63 were wounded			1
the ban on women in specialties such as armor , artillery and infantry dates back to 1994			2
the @entity31 loosened some of those restrictions in 2012 , and @entity47 said the result " has been very positive			1
" " if members of our military can meet the qualifications for a job -- and let me be clear , i 'm not talking about reducing the qualifications for the job -- if they can meet the qualifications for the job , then they should have the right to serve , regardless of creed or color or gender or sexual orientation , " he said			2
several @entity5 allies , including @entity105 members @entity103 , @entity106 and @entity107 , allow women to serve in combat posts			1
earlier this month , the @entity12 opened the @entity110 to women , and it has begun recruiting female pilots and crew chiefs			1
the @entity114 put its first female officers on submarines in the past year , and certain female ground troops have been attached to combat units in @entity77 and @entity63			2
@entity1 said thursday 's announcement would be implemented " over time and with careful analysis , " but he added that the service chiefs were unanimous in their support for the move			0
by the numbers : women in the @entity5 military the move is one of the last significant policy decisions made by @entity47 , who is expected to leave in mid-february			1
it is not clear where former sen. @entity133 , the nominated replacement , stands , but officials say he was apprised of @entity47 's announcement			1
the @entity138 recently filed a federal lawsuit against the @entity31 , charging that combat exclusion is unfair and outdated			0
the plaintiffs , who include women awarded @entity143 , also say the exclusion places them at a disadvantage for promotion			2
@entity1 suggested allowing women into combat units may ease the military 's ongoing problem with sexual harassment : " i have to believe , the more we can treat people equally , the more likely they are to treat each other equally			1
" thursday 's announcement drew an early cheer from rep. @entity158 , @entity159 , who served in @entity77 as an officer in her state 's @entity161			0
" the first two women who earned @entity164 since @entity165 , one was a military police sergeant			1
another was a medic , " @entity158 told @entity0 ahead of thursday 's announcement			0
" and they both were operating on the front lines per se , under fire , under extreme duress , shoulder to shoulder with their male and female counterparts and exhibiting great courage and heroism and saving the lives of their brothers and sisters			2
" opinion : a more equal military ? bring back draft not every position will open at once , however			2
each service will have to examine its jobs and produce a timetable for integration			0
and gen. @entity191 , the chief of the @entity12 's @entity192 , said the services are developing new physical standards to make sure recruits are capable of meeting the physical demands of combat roles			1
" if you say , ' i want to be an infantryman , ' we 'll say , ' can you pick up 54 pounds , you know , three feet in the air ? can you carry 66 pounds on your back ? ' " @entity191 said			0
@entity191 said that 's the biggest concern he hears from soldiers			0
and it 's one echoed by @entity207 , a former infantry sergeant who now publishes a military blog , " this @entity209 n't @entity210			2
" @entity207 , who fought in the 1991 @entity211 , said he believes physical standards will be relaxed " in order to force the acceptance of women in the combat arms specialties			1
" " i know it 's an eventuality , because the social scientists at the @entity31 are going to want to see numbers that get accepted in there so they can show how just the whole thing is , " he said			0
readers skirmish over women in battle @entity1 said the services can still recommend closing a particular specialty or unit to women -- but " they have to explain why , and i think there will be the right amount of scrutiny on that			2
" and @entity207 said he was n't reassured by @entity1 's insistence that the brass is supportive			0
" i 'm sure they all stood and saluted and said ' yes sir ' and marched out smartly , but i do n't think they 're all 100 % behind it , " he said			0
but @entity158 said there will be women who qualify for combat units under today 's standards -- such as a friend of hers from @entity247 school			1
opinion : women in combat a dangerous experiment " she did 100 pushups in two minutes , " @entity158 said			0
" and she is a great example of one of our many fine women warriors that we have out there			0
" @entity47 is setting the goal of january 2016 for all assessments to be complete and women to be integrated as much as possible , a senior defense official said wednesday			1
the @entity31 must notify @entity264 of each job or unit as it is sent up to the secretary to be opened to women			0
then the @entity31 must wait 30 days while @entity264 is in session before implementing the change			0
it is a marked difference from the way the military ended the exclusion of gays serving openly , or the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			1
in that case , there were no stipulations attached to openly gay service members			0
there was no staggered approach that integrated openly gay troops into units			0
it was instead done all at once , across the board			0
former troops say time has come for women in combat units @entity0 @entity31 correspondent @entity290 contributed to this report .			0
