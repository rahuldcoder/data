the report , based on a fact - finding mission led by former @entity16 jurist @entity15 , was released last month and concluded that @entity6 and @entity7 had both committed " actions amounting to war crimes , possibly crimes against humanity			1
" speaking at the start of the meeting , @entity6 ambassador @entity21 blasted the @entity24 for even holding the special session			0
@entity21 said it " had nothing to do with human rights and everything to do with @entity30 politics			0
" he said adoption of the " biased " recommendations of the @entity35 report , which calls for further action by the @entity38 and @entity37 if both sides do not conduct credible investigations , would constitute a " reward for terror " that " will set back hopes for peace in the region			1
" previously , @entity6 prime minister @entity46 warned the @entity47 that pushing action on the @entity35 report would deal " a mortal blow " to the peace process			2
the council received the report september 29 but took no action , after a request by the @entity47 to defer discussion for six months			0
the @entity47 government of @entity57 came under withering domestic criticism for the move and was accused of succumbing to @entity6 and @entity61 pressure to drop the issue			0
@entity57 reversed course sunday and in a televised address told @entity30 that he was seeking immediate debate within the @entity66 and vowed to work " to punish everyone who was responsible for the hideous crimes committed against our children , our men and women -- especially in our dear @entity8			1
" @entity73 , the @entity47 's @entity1 ambassador in @entity74 , said @entity6 had rebuffed the @entity47 's conciliatory move to defer debate on the report and instead had answered " with even more grave violations of the rights of @entity30 " in the form of restrictions of movement and housing demolitions in @entity84			1
the 47 - member @entity66 is expected to vote on the resolution on friday			0
the draft resolution goes beyond the @entity8 conflict			0
it " strongly condemns " measures taken by @entity6 limiting @entity30 ' access to their properties and holy sites " on the basis of national origin , religion , sex , age or any other discriminatory ground			2
" it further condemns " @entity6 violations of human rights in @entity84 , particularly the confiscation of lands and properties , the demolishing of houses and private properties , the construction and expansion of settlements , the continuous construction of the separation wall , changing the demographic and geographic character of @entity84 , the restrictions on the freedom of movement of the @entity30 citizens of @entity84 , as well as the continuous digging and excavation works in and around @entity113 and its vicinity			2
" there is an ongoing dispute about the number of people killed in the three - week military offensive that @entity6 called @entity129 , which began december 27 and ended january 18			1
the @entity8 - based @entity130 put the death toll at 1,419 and said 1,167 of those were non-combatants			0
the @entity6 military released its own figures earlier this year , saying that 1,166 people were killed , 60 percent of whom were " terror operatives			0

report says both @entity6 and @entity7 took " actions amounting to war crimes "
