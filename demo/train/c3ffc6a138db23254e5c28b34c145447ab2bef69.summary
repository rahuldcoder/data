-- @entity1 scored twice , his first goals for @entity3 , to help his club comfortably defeat @entity5 3 - 0 in monday 's @entity7 encounter at @entity8			1
@entity5 , who needed a victory to move above @entity11 into third place in the table , were blown away by a devastating first half performance from @entity3 , who have consolidated sixth position with this result			2
@entity3 began brightly and nearly took a seventh - minute lead when @entity20 's fine strike was tipped onto the post by @entity5 's @entity23 goalkeeper @entity22			0
but the visiting defense was struggling to cope with @entity3 's wave of attacks and the hosts took a deserved lead six minutes later when @entity1 's superbly struck left - footed strike , from just outside the area , swerved past @entity22 for his first goal since joining the club for a @entity34 record transfer fee in january			1
@entity3 doubled their lead in the 34th minute when @entity5 failed to clear a succession of crosses and blocked shots , the ball eventually falling to the feet of @entity41 who fired through the legs of defender @entity44 and past @entity22			0
@entity3 made it 3 - 0 a minute later when @entity46 curled in an inviting cross from the left for @entity1 to outjump @entity44 and help the ball into the far corner of the net			1
@entity3 had chances to increase their lead after the break but @entity22 did well to keep out efforts from @entity46 and @entity41 , while @entity20 fired wide from an acute angle and @entity1 headed over the crossbar from a good position			0
@entity5 's defeat means they lie just three points ahead of @entity61 , who have a game in hand , in the race for the final @entity67 place , with the teams still to play each other this season			2
a bad night for @entity72 's side was made worse with the news that talismanic striker @entity74 is now doubtful for sunday 's @entity76 semifinal against rivals @entity77 at @entity78 , after limping off in the first half with a hamstring injury .			0

@entity1 scores his first @entity3 goals in a 3 - 0 win over @entity5
they are @entity1 's first goals since his records transfer from @entity87 in january
@entity41 also scores as @entity3 consolidate sixth place in the table
