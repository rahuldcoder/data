chocolate is on the menu and unity is the message as @entity5 head to @entity6 , @entity7 , for the first joint @entity9 and @entity10 retreat in 10 years			1
but as house speaker @entity11 and @entity10 majority leader @entity12 lay the groundwork for their agenda on @entity16 this year , tension from conservatives unhappy that their leaders are n't being bold enough could make things awkward			1
comedian @entity22 is slated to warm up the group on wednesday night			2
but even before boarding buses to @entity7 , some republicans clearly were n't ready to sing kumbaya			1
" i think the leadership is unified - unified in doing very little , " conservative rep. @entity27 told @entity0			1
the @entity30 @entity29 told @entity0 it was time to plot a way forward to repeal @entity33 and roll back the president 's actions on immigration -- not focus on finding compromises with president @entity38			2
" they want to all get along with the president , which is not the election results , " @entity27 said about @entity9 leaders , adding , " that 's misreading exactly the opposite of what november 2014 is about			1
" @entity27 was one of the 25 @entity5 who tried to deny @entity11 his third term as speaker , opposing him on a vote earlier this month			2
this vocal group is demanding that @entity11 and @entity51 go big and schedule votes on a variety of proposals to highlight a contrast with the president and congressional democrats , even if those things do n't have the chance of becoming law			0
other @entity9 @entity5 are fed up that this small bloc of conservatives has been able to force the debate to tack to the right , and start off the @entity65 with a focus on the divisions inside the party on hot button issues like immigration			1
" at some point our far right has got to understand that us ' regular conservatives ' are not necessarily on board with what they want to do , " @entity72 rep. @entity71 told @entity0			2
he noted , " our caucus has got to understand that sometimes the noisiest 25 in the caucus is not a majority			0
" in another potential headache for @entity9 leaders , a new group of @entity9 conservatives is setting up a formal structure to meet regularly and develop policy proposals			1
these members do n't believe the current group that already does this - known as the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) - is sufficiently independent of the leadership			2
the current @entity87 chair , @entity90 rep. @entity89 , told @entity0 his group was already influencing the agenda in the @entity9			1
" look at what we 've had on the floor - that 's nothing but a conservative agenda , " he said			0
the splits that have emerged in public are sure to be highlighted in closed door meetings in @entity6			0
organizers have planned breakout sessions on immigration , health care and the budget process			0
former @entity107 prime minister @entity106 , columnist @entity108 , and author @entity109 are also slated to address the group			0
but @entity71 warned " our flanks in the party have got to understand that when you work as a team and accomplish 70 % m it 's way better than what we had last week , " referring to the contentious debate over immigration			0
@entity29 leaders started out the year putting a priority on items conservatives wanted to tackle			2
the @entity9 voted on bills approving the @entity124 pipeline , repealing a key provision of @entity33 , and reversing some of the @entity127 reforms the president pushed for in 2010			1
right before members left for the retreat , the @entity9 approved a funding bill for the @entity132 that also attached a series of amendments nullifying the president 's most recent executive action on immigration			1
@entity9 leaders also allowed a vote on a measure that went even further -- it eliminated a program that deferred deportations for so - called " dreamers " - children of those who entered the @entity146 illegally			1
while the bill passed , a group of 26 @entity148 opposed that amendment dealing with deportations on young people , with many saying that proposal went too far			0
the president had already threatened vetoes on the bulk of the @entity9 bills the @entity9 was passing			1
but at a meeting with bipartisan congressional leaders with president @entity38 on wednesday there was a lot of talk about trying to focus on the things where both sides could agree			0
@entity29 aides are setting low expectations for the retreat - saying this is the beginning of discussions on the way forward on key priorities like getting rid of @entity33 , drafting major tax reform legislation , pushing jobs bills , and cutting federal spending			0
" it 's important that we get together , open up lines of communication and unify around some goals that we have for the upcoming @entity182 , " @entity176 chair @entity175 told @entity0			0
one controversial decision leaders are still grappling with is whether or not to use a procedure known as " budget reconciliation " to try to repeal @entity33			0
if they decide to use this process - one that is available for items that impact the debt and the deficit - @entity10 leaders would just need a simple majority to pass legislation , which gets around a likely @entity194 - led filibuster on @entity33			1
@entity90 sen. @entity197 , a tea - party favorite , in a speech before @entity196 this week , said @entity182 should use " every procedural tool available including reconciliation to repeal @entity33 with 51 votes in the @entity10			1
" but other congressional republicans argue it should be reserved for something the president could sign - like tax reform or a bill boosting infrastructure across the country			2
@entity27 said if leaders decided to use that process to do tax reform instead of repealing @entity33 that would be " a very stupid @entity29 decision - we 're going to help corporations and let the rest of these guys suffer ? " one potential complication for @entity51 is maneuvering his plans while three @entity219 , @entity221 senator @entity220 , and @entity223 senator @entity222 - are preparing possible presidential campaigns for 2016			0
but @entity220 and @entity222 are skipping the retreat .			0

@entity9 and @entity10 republicans will meet jointly for the first time in a decade
