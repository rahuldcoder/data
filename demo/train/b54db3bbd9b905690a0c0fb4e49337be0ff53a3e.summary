-- broken noses , black eyes , bent fingers -- rugby players wear their battle scars as badges of honor			1
" you 're never in danger of not being seen as a rugby player , " says @entity9 's @entity8 , who at 6 feet 8 inches ( 2.03 meters ) tall is never in danger of not being seen			1
" @entity15 you wear on your face , basically			0
" after a 15 - year international career , @entity8 has his fair share of bumps and bruises to take into his third @entity21 in @entity22			1
among the marks the game has left on his frame over the years is a classic rugby war wound , one that is increasingly rare in the modern , headgear - wearing era : a cauliflower ear			1
but his is a minor example compared to some former players			2
a bluffer 's guide to rugby union @entity9 scrum coach and former player @entity35 is naturally blessed with ears like taxi doors , but the former loosehead prop augmented them with years of hard service in front row of the scrum			1
as one of the ways to restart play , the set scrum is also one area of the game that can be hard to referee -- and what really goes on in there is only really known by the players themselves			1
but if the battle scars of rugby have n't changed much since @entity8 first started playing in 1990 , he says that pretty much every other part of the game has been transformed			1
@entity22 's @entity21 obsession professionalism , training regimes , nutritionists and physios have all combined to create the modern players ' physiques			1
" it amuses me that in adverts and in films that get made about rugby , often they 're blokes that are overweight and with beer bellies			2
that 's not the case anymore , " @entity8 says			1
" bumps and minor injuries are part and parcel of the game , given the strength and the speed of players playing now			1
but also guys now are conditioned more to take the hits			0
" it can look worse than it is as these days there are something like 15 tv cameras trained on every game			2
it can even be in @entity92 and you can watch it in slow motion			0
" that 's easy for @entity8 to say			1
his enduring toughness has given him the ability to play at the highest level for over 20 years			2
but for armchair spectators , the hard - hitting part of rugby they find so appealing remains best sampled vicariously			2
" i 've played with dislocated fingers			0
you often get ( injuries ) a couple of days before a game			1
you just tape them up and get on with it , " @entity8 says			1
the ultimate example of " getting on with it " must be former @entity22 captain @entity113			0
in a match against @entity116 in 1986 , his scrotum was ripped by an opponent 's studded boot			0
it 's a horrific injury that would make most never want to play again , but @entity113 went to the sideline , had it stitched up and amazingly went back on the field to play the rest of the match			0
@entity113 has said that he does n't remember the incident or the game itself , having also been knocked out and losing a few teeth as well			0
rules have tightened up against dangerous play to curb stray boots and flying fists			1
" the game is n't quite as ferocious nowadays , " says @entity8			1
" well , basically there are not quite as many fights			0
" @entity135 tackling and taking out players who are jumping for the ball are not allowed because of the potentially career or even life - threatening consequences			2
as well as tighter laws , having so many cameras at big matches has meant that players ca n't get away with any foul play behind the referee 's back			2
certainly nothing like the organized brawl that took place on the @entity151 tour to @entity152 in 1974 that has become a rugby legend			0
after some violent play in previous matches , @entity151 captain @entity154 decided before the match in @entity158 that his team would " get their retaliation in first " at the first sign of @entity164 aggression			0
when " 99 " was called at a lineout , each one of the 15 @entity151 players took a swing at an opponent , meaning the referee could n't identify the instigator of the fight			0
not one player was sent off			0
as he looks forward to what will probably be his last international appearances , @entity8 has no nostalgia for the old days			2
the game remains tough enough without too many of the extras			0
" the level of rucking ( a contest for the ball after a tackle ) has pretty much been eradicated from the game , which has made it a lot safer			0
you do n't come away from a game with a road map on your back made of ruck marks			0

physical nature of rugby means that bruises and injuries are common
players are fitter and stronger than ever *due* to modern training regimes

rules have tightened up against dangerous play to curb stray boots and flying fists
