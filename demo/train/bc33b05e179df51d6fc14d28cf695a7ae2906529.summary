@entity0 -- if there 's one thing you notice in the @entity7 ' sprawling office building on @entity0 's @entity8 it 's that there are newspapers ... everywhere			1
piles upon piles of trademark salmon pink paper , the fruit of endless days of hard work that even the most seasoned journalists ca n't bring themselves to recycle			2
they fill every gap between desks , there are stacks on the floor , and in corridors , next to the odd cursory pot plant			0
there 's a charm about it , that of a place with its priorities straight			2
inside the @entity7 : discover more editor @entity30 tells me that when he started the @entity7 , the newsroom was full of " cigarette smoke and typewriters making a lot of noise			1
" the typewriters are long gone and , with them , most of the noise			0
but , says @entity30 , " there is still something special about a newsroom			0
" twenty years ago the piles of newspapers may not have been so striking			2
hard to believe now , but @entity7 only launched in 1995			1
this year -- 17 years later -- digital subscriptions overtook print for the first time			1
this has undoubtedly changed the way the operation runs			0

@entity30 has an interesting view of this			0
" working for the print newspaper and for ft.com , " he says , " is a little like walking and chewing gum at the same time -- it is actually possible			1
" read more : print media hail @entity67 's potential possible , and profitable			1
in 2001 @entity7 became one of the first online newspapers to introduce a paywall , and charge users for its content			1
chief executive @entity74 says people thought they were " a little strange , to put it politely " , but they stuck with it , and it 's worked			2
the numbers are proof enough			0
over 300,000 digital subscribers and sales up 7 % in the first half of this year			0
and , @entity74 says , there 's an " accidental benefit " that has transformed the business			0
they do n't just know how many people are reading , they know who they are and what they are reading			0
that " enables us to do a much better job of developing products and services and being relevant to our readers , " he added			0
the @entity7 ' business is solid			2
the digital future , however , is not without collateral damage			0
@entity1 spent a day with the @entity7 in april , observing everything from the morning editorial meeting , to the evening frenzy at the east @entity0 print site			1
in september , the owners of that print site , @entity106 , went into administration , and the @entity7 ' subsidiary @entity109 's @entity108 had to step in to run the site			1
walking and chewing gum is possible , but not without risks .			1

@entity1 's @entity114 goes behind the scenes of the @entity7
she finds piles of newsprint , but an organization *focused* on the digital age
filing for print and digital is described as like ' walking and chewing gum ' at the same time
this can be done -- but it 's not without risks
