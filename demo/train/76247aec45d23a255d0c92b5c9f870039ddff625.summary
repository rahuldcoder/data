-- @entity1 once said , " in life , what counts is the size of a man 's heart , not the size of his disproportionate willie			1
" @entity10 , there was an awkward moment of silence among those standing in the open shower at the old @entity17 @entity16 gym , as the 16th president nervously added , " i 'm serious , guys			2
" but despite @entity1 's largely unknown and forgotten " @entity22 " -- which i may have just completely made up -- a recent study appears to have proven this belief scientifically incorrect			1
yes , gentlemen , when it comes to the preference of heterosexual women , perhaps our worst fear is true			1
at least according to a new study that quickly found its way around the @entity36			1
because , of course it did			2
we like this kind of stuff -- anything about genitals or cats			2
whereas , if they found a cure for cancer , maybe six people would give it a tweet			2
but check out this cat ! lol			2
# @entity52 " you 're all weirdo sinners			2
the big buzz about this study started when research results appeared this week in the @entity59			1
which is one of those fancy journals where normal people understand about every 15th word			2
and even fewer if you cheated your way through mr. @entity67 's high school physiology and anatomy class			1
what bone is this ? " " dude , @entity71 , that 's not a bone			2
" the point is that it 's a super-science - y journal			1
and it 's difficult to read			2
but , on the plus side , for those of us more intellectually suited to watching a good episode of " cops , " if you sound out the publication 's acronym , @entity59 , it makes a delightfully funny word that brings us right back to the topic at hand			2
@entity92 , an @entity93 biologist now at the @entity94 , was the lead author of the study , and conducted his research while in @entity97			1
which i believe completely invalidates the results			0
not for any particularly scientific reason , but it helps me sleep at night			0
even @entity102 took solace in the technicality : " the good news ? my wife is n't @entity97			1
" regardless , just how does one come to a scientific , unbiased conclusion on the importance of large manhood ? you know , without mixing in other result - skewing personal features like a lush ginger beard and a bald head			1
those kind of horrible things			0
well , that 's where the computer models come in			1
down in @entity97 , 105 lucky ladies were asked to rate the sexual attractiveness of about 50 life - sized computer - generated , naked male figures with different body structures			1
some of them may have been @entity128			0
( full images of the figures here			1
warning : @entity132 , gray full - frontal ) we 'll never know , because the gray - colored figures did not possess any other features			1
just unique body types and varying amounts of @entity140 filler			1
the figures were then projected on a screen so the women could rate them from 1 to 7			1
all rating scales should go to 10			0
i 'm a metric guy , and it 's just the natural order of things			0
especially when it comes to rating attractiveness			0
otherwise , there 's not enough wiggle room for minor beauty flaws			0
always a three - point deduction			1
but never mind such little things			0
for these women , overall height and body shape seemed to be the most important factors			1
which is n't a big surprise			0
however , a man 's nether region was definitely an important factor			1
and as the overall size down below increased , so , too , did the sexual attractiveness scores			1
the women also spent more time actually staring at the goods			1
hello ? our eyes are up here ! just kidding			0
we 'll just watch some baseball			0
but here 's the thing			0
for taller men , size was even more important			1
quite simply , it 's a matter of proportion			2
when your canvas is bigger , @entity181 is harder to find			2
that said , if it actually looks like @entity181 , you need to see a doctor			0
today , if they can schedule you in			0
( but put it on @entity189 first			0
mega up - votes ! ) now , for shorter men , being bigger downstairs was also important			1
but only when compared to other short men			0
if you bring a taller man into the mix , not even an actual @entity196 will help you compete			0
though you might make it on tv			0
sadly , even if the tall guy has but a sapling , he still has the advantage			0
so long as he 's fit			0
because , under these scientific conditions , that 's still the biggest factor			0
fortunately , though , humans are n't computer - generated gray figurines projected on walls			1
and courtside seats to the @entity217			0
and that 's what really counts			0
just as long as you do n't have fuzzy earlobes .			0

new study *confirms* that when it comes to male anatomy , " size does matter "
computer - generated male figures were shown to @entity97 women
overall body figure is still most important , but males with bigger *appendages* were rated higher
