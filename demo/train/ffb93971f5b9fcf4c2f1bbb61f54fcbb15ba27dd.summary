-- a @entity2 army general wednesday approved a possible death penalty in the future military trial of maj. @entity5 , the @entity6 accused of killing 13 people at @entity8 , @entity9 , in 2009			1
lt. gen. @entity10 , the @entity8 commander , formally announced that the charges against @entity5 will be tried as capital offenses in a general court - martial			1
his decision means that if a panel of military officers finds @entity5 guilty , they can consider the death penalty as a possible sentence			1
@entity10 's decision moves the case forward and also eliminates the possibility that @entity5 , a psychiatrist , could enter a guilty plea and prevent a costly and lengthy trial			1
a court - martial could be months away			0
" after a referral of a case to trial by court - martial , a military judge will receive the case and at some future date , set a schedule , " said a statement from @entity8 on wednesday			1
" the first likely matter for a military judge to schedule in this court - martial is the arraignment of @entity5			1
no military judge has been named to this case at this time			0
" a capital court - martial is highly unusual			0
the last military execution in the @entity2 took place in 1961			0
@entity5 is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 others in november 2009			1
witnesses at a preliminary hearing identified him as the man who calmly walked through a medical building on the country 's largest military base , shooting and frequently reloading his handgun as he shouted " @entity54 , " which means " @entity56 is great " in @entity57			0
@entity5 's government - appointed defense lawyer , @entity58 , had urged the military against allowing the death penalty as a possible sentence in a trial			1
@entity58 met behind closed doors with @entity66 officials in mid-may to argue that the case should not have the possibility of the death penalty , and described his meeting with @entity10 as very cordial			1
" the law accepts life without the opportunity of parole as an appropriate punishment for murder , " @entity58 said			0
" we had an opportunity to make our compelling argument that the ( @entity5 ) case should be referred noncapital			2
" @entity58 was at the jail wednesday morning , meeting his client , when the prosecution delivered papers to him informing him that the court - martial would proceed with a possible death penalty			1
the defense attorney said he was not properly informed in advance and was not provided with the necessary documents by the prosecution			0
" it is a sad , sad day to see how they are proceeding , " @entity58 told @entity0 by telephone			0
" they continue to use these tactics that are a denigration of the defendant 's right to due process			0
" @entity58 has previously said that a noncapital trial for his client would be quicker and cheaper			0
and he repeatedly has complained that he and his client have been denied full details of what @entity2 intelligence agencies knew about @entity5 's contacts with overseas terrorists , including @entity105 , an @entity2 - born cleric now believed to be in @entity106 and to be the target of @entity2 drone attacks			2
@entity5 , who is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair after being shot by police responding to the rampage , is being held in a county jail near @entity8			1
last week , the @entity115 administration 's top anti-terrorism official pointed to the @entity8 killings as an example of how extremists overseas were inspiring or assisting violent attacks inside the @entity2			2
" it is @entity128 's adherents -- individuals , sometimes with little or no direct physical contact with @entity128 , who have succumbed to its hateful ideology and who have engaged in , or facilitated , terrorist activities here in the @entity2 , " @entity120 , assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism , said in a speech in @entity125 on june 29			0
" these misguided individuals are spurred on by the likes of @entity128 's @entity138 and @entity105 in @entity106 , who speak @entity139 and preach violence in slick videos over the @entity142 , " @entity120 said			0
" and we have seen the tragic results , with the murder of a military recruiter in @entity147 two years ago and the attack on our servicemen and women at @entity8			2
" @entity120 said the shootings at @entity8 and the attempted bombing of an airliner in december 2009 had prompted new vigilance by @entity2 intelligence			1
" following the attack at @entity8 and the failed attack over @entity158 , we 've improved the analytic process , created new groups to track threat information , and enhanced cooperation among our intelligence agencies , including better information sharing so that all threats are acted upon quickly			2
" an investigation by two senior @entity2 senators called @entity5 " a ticking time bomb " and faulted both the military and federal agents for not raising the alarm sooner about his links to overseas terrorists and possible violence			2
" although neither the @entity177 nor the @entity178 had specific information concerning the time , place , or nature of the attack , they collectively had sufficient information to have detected @entity5 's radicalization to violent @entity186 extremism but failed both to understand and to act on it , " that report said the @entity66 admitted problems with how it had evaluated and promoted @entity5 and disciplined nine officers for " administrative and leadership failures " in not spreading the alarm about @entity5 before the attacks .			0
