-- @entity1 ushered @entity2 into a bedroom , shutting the door behind them			1
the room was pitch - black inside			2
@entity2 blindly turned toward @entity1 , uttering his name			1
at that same moment , she says , she detected movement in the room -- and felt someone bump into her			2
-- " a rape on @entity14 , " @entity12 the above scene is just the beginning			1
in the paragraphs that follow , writer @entity17 gives excruciatingly painful details of what allegedly happened to @entity2 , a freshman at the @entity21 , over the course of the next three hours as she was allegedly gang - raped by members of @entity1 's fraternity			1
" grab its motherf * * * ing leg , " one guy in the crowd said			0
" @entity2 was dehumanized in every sense imaginable			1
according to @entity12 , after a classmate penetrated @entity2 with a beer bottle , she passed out			1
she woke up at 3 a.m. , alone , her face beaten , her dress torn and spattered with blood			0
going barefoot down the stairs , past the frat party still in full swing , @entity2 left the building and called her friends			1
and this , if you can imagine it , is where the story gets worse			0
opinion : punish rapists , not fraternities the article continues : @entity2 's friends , two guys and one woman , ultimately decided she should n't be taken to the hospital or report the rape because if she did , " her reputation will be shot for the next four years			1
" @entity2 's female friend insisted , " she 's gon na be the girl who cried ' rape , ' and we 'll never be allowed into any frat party again			1
" this reaction is fairly unique to rape as compared with other crimes			2
after all , if someone is mugged or murdered , such crimes are generally reported to the police			0
for instance , the federal government estimates that 65 % of rape or sexual assault cases are unreported , while 17 % of car thefts are unreported			2
on the day the @entity12 article about @entity2 's alleged rape was published , @entity76 , a web producer at @entity77 , wrote a string of tweets imagining what it would look like if people responded to her wallet being stolen the way they respond to rape			1
" ' i think that guy i know stole my wallet , ' " @entity76 tweeted , followed by the hypothetical responses : " well , do you have proof ? were you drinking that night ? what were you wearing when this happened ? " " are you sure that you did n't just give him your wallet , and now you 're embarrassed about it ? maybe there was just some miscommunication			0
" " have you lost wallets before ? just curious , just trying to get a better sense of what 's going on here			0
he has such a bright future			0
" " nobody is going to want to hang out with the girl who cried stolen wallet			0
you should really think hard about what you 're saying here			0
" " all guys want wallets , it 's just in their nature			0
maybe you should n't have had a wallet in the first place			0
" @entity76 told @entity114 that her motivation for the tweets was " seeing so many people doubt victims , almost as a reflex , in ways that people who are victims ( of ) other crimes rarely seem to face			0
" the shaming of rape victims is especially stark in contrast to the attitude of nonchalance or even boastfulness used by rapists			1
in the @entity12 article , @entity2 describes how she ran into @entity1 ( not his real name ) during her lifeguard shift at a @entity21 pool , just two weeks after her alleged rape			1
" ' i wanted to thank you for the other night , ' @entity1 said			0
' i had a great time			0
' " could you imagine @entity1 parading around like nothing had happened if he 'd just committed a murder ? @entity2 reported her rape , plus two other similar gang rapes she learned about at the same @entity144 fraternity , to @entity145 , head of @entity21 's @entity146			1
@entity145 told @entity2 she could file a report with the police and that the university would support her if she did so , though the university did not exactly encourage her to report the crime			2
@entity2 still has not filed a criminal or civil suit			2
it was not until @entity12 started poking around and asking questions about the rape allegations that the university began to investigate the matter			1
opinion : @entity21 's answer to rape allegations a farce meanwhile @entity2 , once a promising student engaged in all sorts of extracurricular activities of campus life , was abandoned by her friends , became depressed , and at one point , suicidal , the article said			1
she slept for days on end and fell behind in her studies			0
on the other hand , @entity1 , as of the writing of the @entity12 article , was set to graduate , entirely untarnished -- as were the other men involved in the alleged rape			1
" rapists make us less uncomfortable than rape victims , " @entity176 recently wrote in @entity177			2
" predators demand so much less than victims ; they are n't as inconvenient			0
they do n't bleed or hurt or reveal their gaping wounds			0
if we do n't doubt them , we do not have to doubt ourselves			0
" murder and robbery , after all , are obviously aberrant and therefore easy to call out			2
but rape ? rape is so horribly common that talking about it , exploring why it happens , investigating the culture and context of it , would seem to indict every aspect of a school like the @entity21 that apparently has not done enough to address the problem			1
when will we come to terms with our naive illusions about what goes on in places like @entity21 and at frat parties in every corner of @entity202 ? if we do n't grapple with that reality , more young women will be destroyed			2
will @entity1 and @entity21 get off easily while @entity2 's life -- and other college women like her -- is shattered ? if @entity21 has any sense of moral rightness and wishes to remain a great university , it should conduct a thorough investigation into these and similar allegations and mete out appropriate punishment for the perpetuators			1
universities everywhere should take serious steps to address sexual assault on campuses rather than trying to cover them up .			0

@entity12 says a freshman , @entity2 , was allegedly gang - raped by members of a fraternity
@entity226 : when it comes to rape , there is so much shaming of the victim in our *society*
she asks if a person reports murder or robbery , she will likely be believed , so why not rape ?
@entity226 : @entity21 , and other colleges , should take rape allegations seriously and investigate
