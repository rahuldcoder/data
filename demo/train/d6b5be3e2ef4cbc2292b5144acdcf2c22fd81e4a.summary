-- so @entity1 was seven years old when she gave her first violin recital			0
she was in love with music , but at age 12 she had to make a tough decision			0
" i started playing golf in elementary school			0
one day my golf coach took the team to a golf course and i fell in love with it			0
i loved walking the course and being out in nature , " recalls @entity13 , now 22			1
she started to notice several professional golfers , like fellow @entity17			1
" she was fashionable , powerful and beautiful , " @entity13 says			1
her golf was getting so much better that her mother asked what everyone had been thinking : " do you want to become a violinist or a professional golfer ? " the moment of truth " it was one of the hardest decisions i have ever had to make			2
i always wanted to become violinist , " @entity13 acknowledges			1
by that time , she already had a role model : a girl who played on the elite @entity32 - based @entity31 , and who , at age 20 , became the first @entity17 to claim a major title : @entity36			1
" she is a great trailblazer for all @entity17 golfers			1
she played super great on the @entity31 and because of that we could dream about playing on the world stage , " @entity13 says			1
" but , this is not only her influence , we must be thankful to @entity43 , and @entity44 and other first generation @entity17 players on the @entity31			1
" with her mind solely on golf , @entity13 informed her family about her decision to put the violin to one side , though her mother was not convinced			1
" ' really ? no violin ? ' my mom was so disappointed with my decision because everybody said i had a talent for music			0
i think my mom enjoyed choosing my recital dresses and having me perform on stage			0
" the transition waking up early for practice was one of the toughest things in @entity13 's new life			1
little by little she got used to it and during the transition she discovered that her musical background would be very helpful			0
as a junior golfer , she had some trouble with her swing but her shots were good enough			2
" my swing tempo was consistently well and i think i got my good tempo from music , " she says			0
in 2006 , at age 16 , @entity13 represented @entity77 in the @entity78 in @entity79 and won gold in the individual and team events			1
having impressed as an amateur , @entity13 turned professional at the end of the following year and joined the @entity84 , the @entity17 women 's tour			1
she won her first tournament as a @entity84 member , triumphing by four strokes at the @entity91 in april 2008			2
her first winner 's check brought her back to her first love -- she bought a violin for her sister , who had decided to pursue music as a career			2
the 2009 season would be even better for @entity13			2
aged just 19 , she won five times , earned over $ 500,000 and finished second in the @entity103 race			0
but the real breakthrough came in 2011 , at the most prestigious tournament in the female game : the @entity105			1
after a shaky opening round that put her six strokes off the pace , @entity13 shot 69 on friday and saturday to share the lead going into the final day			2
the tournament ended in a showdown between @entity13 and her rival @entity114 -- who had beaten her to the @entity84 player of the year award two years earlier			1
this time it was @entity13 who prevailed			2
she forced a playoff with a birdie on the last regulation green before , after three extra holes , becoming just the fifth @entity17 to win the major			1
a sixth , @entity125 , will defend her title at @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 , this week			0
@entity13 emulated her hero @entity130 -- who 13 years earlier became the first @entity17 to win it -- and , along with the winner 's check of $ 585,000 , it prompted her to make the next big step in her career			1
" i transferred from the @entity84 to the @entity31 and people started to recognize me , " she says			2
" i moved to the @entity32 and i am now based in @entity137			0
that was a pretty big change , relocating to another country			0
" a keen student despite moving , @entity13 continued studying physical education at @entity142 , a private institution and the oldest of her country , and graduated in february this year with a bachelor 's degree in sports management			1
. " i could not and would not trade my university life for anything			0
it was such a great time for me , " she says			0
" sometimes i could n't sleep during a tournament because of assignments			0
i had to wake up early if i wanted to practice before going to class			0
physically , it was a hard job but it was worth it			0
" that work ethic goes some way to explaining the success of @entity17 women golfers and @entity13 is now hoping that she can inspire new generations of young players like @entity130 and @entity44 did for her			1
" i 'd love to be someone 's role model			0
i want to share my experience and heart , " says the golfer , who finished second behind compatriot and close friend @entity170 at this season 's opening major , the @entity173 in april ,			2
" i would like to donate to poor people or junior golfers			0
i really want to support young golfers , not as an instructor but as a manager			0
" the best decision @entity13 's determination at age 12 has led her to become one of the best players in women 's golf ; she currently sits fifth in the @entity188 world rankings , just behind @entity189 , while @entity17 is no. 1 after also winning this month 's @entity191			1
last weekend the two friends battled for victory at the @entity195 event , with @entity17 beating @entity13 in a playoff to claim her fifth win this season			1
" @entity170 and i practice together a lot so when we are standing at the 18th hole , it feels like just a practice round , " @entity13 told reporters			2
" i was n't really nervous			0
two players can not be champion , so she deserved it			0
" @entity13 was named 2012 's @entity208 , having won the 11th title of her pro career by a massive seven shots at the @entity213			1
her love for music is still alive , and @entity13 acknowledges that it " is too hard " to even think of trading her accomplishments in golf for a night as concertmaster of the @entity221 or @entity223 's @entity222			1
her mother , who once was not satisfied with her daughter 's decision , is now " so happy that i am a professional golfer			2
" and it was from her mom that she received the advice that has shaped her career : " enjoy your life			0
