@entity0 -- vice president @entity2 faces a very delicate task this week as he makes a diplomatic visit to @entity5 in hopes of turning down the volume on an increasingly noisy territorial tug of war			1
the spotlight also provides @entity2 with an opportunity to remind people why @entity12 chose him as his running mate and to tout his strong suit as he 's mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2016			1
@entity2 promises to press @entity16 on airspace dispute @entity2 has decades of experience in international relations			1
he served as chairman or the ranking @entity21 of the @entity22 from 1997 until he left @entity23 in 2008 following @entity12 's victory			1
" this trip , if nothing else , reinforces the notion of why @entity2 was put on the ticket in the first place and has emerged as one of the best vice presidents in history , " @entity25 , a longtime senior political adviser to the @entity21 , told @entity1			1
" he was equipped for this job before he got there			0
he 's not going to @entity16 for that reason , of course , but it certainly does n't hurt			2
" " it 's definitely his wheelhouse			0
he has the relationships , the global credibility			0
there 's no on - the - job training necessary			0
" @entity2 flies in to diplomatic turbulence in @entity5 the long - planned trip , which was originally to focus on economic issues , comes as tensions in @entity5 are on the rise			1
" the vice president 's trip comes at an important time for the country and therefore it makes him that more relevant and reminds @entity55 of his longtime role in the @entity22 and his experience with foreign policy , " @entity53 , editor and publisher of the non-partisan @entity53 , told @entity1			1
@entity16 's air defense zone : what you need to know @entity2 's first stop was @entity63 , where longtime ally @entity64 and the @entity55 are pushing back against @entity16 's recent declaration of a restricted flight zone over parts of the @entity69 that include some islands claimed by both @entity16 and @entity64			1
in a meeting on tuesday with @entity64 prime minister @entity72 , @entity2 said the @entity55 was " deeply concerned by the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the @entity69			2
" @entity2 reaffirmed that " the @entity55 looks to our alliance with @entity64 as the cornerstone of stability and security in @entity5 , and we are fully committed to our announced strategy of rebalancing as well in the @entity84 , " according to a @entity76 transcript of the meeting			1
and in an interview with the @entity87 daily newspaper , @entity2 rejected concerns that the @entity55 may not have staying power in the region , saying " economically , diplomatically , militarily , we have been , we are , and we will remain a resident @entity84 power			1
" the @entity76 highlighted @entity2 's experience in global diplomacy on monday			1
" he has an excellent relationship with the leaders of all three countries and he will underscore how important it is to avoid actions that raise tensions and to prevent miscalculations that could undermine peace , security and prosperity in the region , " @entity76 press secretary @entity94 told reporters			0
in @entity64 , @entity2 promises to press @entity16 on airspace dispute " this is an opportunity for vice president @entity2 to raise our concerns directly with policy makes in @entity113 and to seek clarity in regarding the @entity16 intentions in making this move at this time			1
it 's also an opportunity for us to confer with our allies , @entity64 and the @entity119 , both of whom are directly affected by @entity16 's actions , " @entity94 added			1
@entity25 said the most important thing for @entity2 right now , as it relates to any possible @entity76 run in 2016 , is to continue to serve as a strong no. 2			2
" the main thing that the vice president has to do is do his job , and do it well , " @entity25 added			0
@entity2 has not said whether he 'll make a third run for the @entity131 presidential nomination following unsuccessful bids in 1988 and 2008			2
" i can die a happy man never having been @entity134			0
but it does n't mean i wo n't run , " @entity2 said in a july interview with @entity136			2
his trip in september to @entity139 , the state that traditionally kicks off the presidential primary and caucus calendar , sparked more speculation about his ambitions			0
@entity2 , who went to the @entity139 to headline @entity131 sen. @entity148 's annual steak fry , a must stop for @entity131 @entity76 hopefuls , joked , " it 's amazing when you come to speak at the steak fry , a whole lot of people seem to take notice			1
i do n't know why the hell that is			0
" most of the speculation about possible 2016 @entity131 candidates is focused on whether former secretary of state @entity158 will run again			0
all polling suggests @entity160 would be the immediate and overwhelming frontrunner for the nomination if she does			0
the most recent national survey on a potential @entity131 field came from @entity1 / @entity165 two weeks ago and indicated that 63 % of @entity131 and @entity166 who lean towards the @entity131 said @entity160 was their early choice for the nomination , with @entity2 second at 12 %			0
@entity1 2016 poll : @entity160 favored for democrats but how would the race for the @entity131 nomination shape up if @entity160 forgoes another run for the @entity76 ? @entity158 and the sisterhood if that 's the case , the poll suggested that 43 % of @entity131 would support the vice president , with freshman sen. @entity180 of @entity181 at 17 % , and @entity183 gov. @entity182 at 15 %			0
of course , polls conducted this early in an election cycle , far before any possible contenders have declared their candidacy , are partially a reflection of name recognition			0
and @entity2 of course , has a lot of name recognition			0
crossfire : support for @entity2 , @entity195 in 2016 while the headlines this week from @entity2 's trip will add to that name recognition and further beef up his foreign policy and commander - in - chief credentials , @entity2 has a problem if @entity160 runs again			2
" clearly , @entity2 is not an amateur when it comes to @entity55 foreign policy , but unfortunately for him former secretary of state @entity158 's @entity160 's experience in that realm trumps his , " @entity53 added .			2

@entity5 trip gives @entity2 opportunity to remind people why @entity12 chose him as running mate
@entity2 was to *discuss* economic issues on trip but focus shifted to rising tensions with @entity16
@entity219 has decades of experience from his time on @entity22
@entity2 tells @entity224 allies -- and @entity16 -- that " we will remain a resident @entity84 power "
