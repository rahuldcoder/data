-- say these names as fast as you can : @entity4 , @entity5 , oh no it 's my mother - in - law , @entity7			1
it 's not a playground tongue twister , but a legitimate list of horse names , announced at speed by racing commentators adept at wrapping their lips around some of the most difficult -- and ridiculous -- titles on the planet			1
silly horse names are as much a part of the racing experience as ladies in hats or laying a bet			1
but naming a thoroughbred is also a fine art subject to strict international regulations , with the power to both sway punters and shape the horse 's legacy			1
" if you look at the big races , there are not many horses who win them without good names , " @entity32 racing commentator @entity31 said			1
" @entity40 ( the superstar colt who recently retired after an unblemished 14 - win career ) was a cracking name			1
it was very distinctive , strong and easy to pronounce -- it absolutely jumped out of the microphone			0
" added to that was the fairytale story of trainer sir @entity49 naming him after trainer @entity40 , who died from cancer			1
it created a certain mystique around the horse			2
" so why are many horse names downright weird ? it 's partly a way of getting around rules dictating that no professional thoroughbreds have the same name			1
that includes names which are spelled differently , but phonetically sound the same			2
names can be no longer than 18 characters , with up to seven syllables			2
each name is also protected for 20 years , and up to 35 years if the horse goes to stud after retiring			1
then there 's the holy grail of names considered so important , they can never be used again			1
when people say , " there 'll never be another @entity40 , " they are n't wrong			1
the @entity74 has put the champion horse on its eternally protected list , alongside such greats as @entity80 gelding @entity78 and @entity82 stallion @entity81			1
one loophole does allow horses from different countries to have the same name -- provided they include the nation 's prefix at the end			2
and if you want to name your horse after a person or company , you 've got to have their permission			0
@entity32 prime minister @entity97 famously turned down a request by the late @entity99 -- a former celebrity chef , politician and grandson of the famed psychoanalyst @entity102 -- to name his horse after her			0
he called it weareagrandmother instead			0
there 's also the minefield of names deemed too offensive for the track			1
among the risque suggestions which failed to get the seal of approval from the @entity32 @entity114 's administrative arm , @entity115 , are : @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			0
the names of terrorist organizations such as @entity122 and @entity123 have also been turned away , though @entity115 racing director @entity124 admitted suspect names had " slipped through the net " in the past			2
" you 've also got to take cultural differences into account			0
in @entity32 , people would generally be quite flattered to have a horse named after them , but in @entity134 it would more likely be seen as an insult , " he said			0
@entity136 commentator @entity31 has had to call some tongue - twisting horse names in a career spanning more than 30 years			1
" a few complicated names in a tight finish can get a bit frightening , " he said " if a few of the more difficult names go down in a race , i think deep down the commentator is thinking , ' thank @entity145 that one 's not involved anymore			2
' " thankfully for @entity31 , the most prolific winners in recent years have had sharp , easily pronounceable names -- think @entity40 or @entity80 supermare @entity149			1
" there 's also a certain trend now for short , real words , " he said			0
" @entity154 is renowned for naming her horses sensible , quite cleverly constructed words -- like @entity157			0
" but can a horse 's name affect its performance ? is it possible to have a champion horse called loser ? @entity31 believes a horse 's name can be self - prophesying -- to an extent			1
" @entity167 's owners reserved the name 10 years ago -- they thought it was a marvelous name but there was no horse that came up to scratch , " @entity31 said			2
" they wanted to wait and attach it to a really great horse who would live up to the mythical title			0
as it turned out , he did n't quite get there in the end			0
" @entity32 colt @entity167 came close to fulfilling his promise , winning this year 's @entity181 and @entity182 but failing to complete the @entity183 after finishing second at the @entity184			0
it 's difficult to pinpoint a link between names and performance			2
but that still has n't stopped horse names having an effect on punters ' betting habits			1
" i think it holds the most sway at something like the @entity197 in @entity32 , where you 've got a large proportion of inexpert betters , " @entity124 said			0
" you 'll have lots of small bets on appealing names -- things that have a human element people can associate with or are cleverly constructed			0
" as for the horse 's legacy , @entity124 puts it down to performance			1
" i think the degree people feel attached to certain names is dependent on the performance of the horse -- not the other way around , " he said			2
so if @entity124 had a horse , what would he name it ? " @entity220			0
it 's a name that just jumped out at me when i gave a talk in @entity223 , in the @entity224 , once			0
" it 's no @entity167			0
but then , as @entity226 's @entity225 famously said : " what 's in a name ? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet			0

silly horse names are a *traditional* part of the horse racing experience
but naming a thoroughbred is also fine art subject to strict international rules
a horse 's name can influence betting among *inexperienced* punters
important horse names , such as @entity40 , are put on a protected register
