-- lots of hotels have traditions			2
nightly happy hours or free check - in snacks are n't that unusual			2
but the rituals at the @entity7 lodgings we 've listed here stand out above the crowd in our book , for either their quirkiness or sheer longevity			2
we think you 'll want to join in on the fun			2
@entity16 , @entity17 & spa @entity18 , @entity19 the passing from day to night is also a cause for celebration at this southwest @entity19 beachfront retreat			1
each day at sunset , crowds gather by the beach to watch a spectacle that includes the ritual banging of the gong ( with one lucky guest chosen to do the honors ) , the traditional blowing of the conch shell and then a 15 - minute performance by a group of @entity37 fire dancers			2
what better way to start to wind down after a day of fun in the sun ? from $ 189 per night			2
@entity41 the @entity42 perhaps the most famous hotel tradition of them all is the twice - daily duck parade that waddles through the lobby of this historic downtown @entity48 property , as it has for the past 80 years			1
at 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. each day , five @entity50 mallards depart their palatial rooftop enclosure , hitch a ride on the elevator ( under the guidance of the official duck master ) and then strut their stuff across a red carpet and into a large marble fountain in the middle of the lobby , where they swim and splash for a bit until it 's time to head back to their lofty penthouse			1
the @entity42 's ducks are so famous , they 've appeared in everything from an episode of " @entity68 ! " to one of the @entity71 swimsuit issues			1
from $ 219 per night			2
@entity72 the @entity74 @entity73 this landmark @entity76 lodging also has a resident species its guests have come to know and love : a fetching feline named @entity82			1
a cat has been a fixture at the @entity74 since a stray wandered into the hotel looking for food and shelter in the 1930s			2
there have been 10 cats in all , the females all named @entity82 and the males all called @entity94 ( a moniker that reportedly came from famed actor @entity95 , who was playing the @entity97 prince at the time )			0
the current kitty , who was rescued from a local shelter in 2010 , is a fluffy , blue - eyed ragdoll who , despite having pretty much the run of the place , often opts to hang out by the front desk , chilling in the lobby 's plush chairs and greeting people as they check in			0
from $ 269 per night			0
@entity110 @entity111 the nightly tradition at this upscale @entity111 accommodation certainly has a lot of pop. that 's because every day at approximately 6 p.m. , either the hotel 's wine butler or the general manager holds court outside the @entity120 and ceremoniously sabers a bottle of champagne to help celebrate evening 's arrival			1
the practice of opening a bottle of bubbly with a military - style sword dates to the days of @entity127 and became a ritual here from the moment the doors opened in 2009			0
wine master @entity131 can even offer tips on how to saber your own bottle using an ordinary chef 's knife			0
from $ 650 per night			0
@entity138 @entity139 and @entity140 , @entity141 encompassing a 405 - acre swath along the banks of the @entity145 just outside @entity146 , this resort makes full use of the gorgeous @entity141 landscape , presenting guests with the opportunity to participate in everything from kayaking and horseback riding to archery and trap shooting			1
one of the most popular on - site activities , however , is the weekly meet and greet with the resort 's bovine mascots , a pair of longhorn steers named @entity161 and ribeye			0
on sundays from 10 a.m. to noon , guests who wander over to the @entity164 hitching post can saddle up atop the beasts for a unique photo op that makes the perfect @entity169 souvenir			1
from $ 199 per night			0
@entity170 @entity171 @entity172 may be known for menu items like beignets and jambalaya , but peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are what visitors look forward to at this historic property known affectionately as the @entity181			1
ever since 1988 , when a hungry guest got a late - night hankering for the nostalgic nosh , the hotel has put out a complimentary spread of pb&j sandwiches along with ice - cold milk and toasty hot chocolate			1
the snacking begins each evening at 10 p.m. from $ 159 per night			1
@entity190 @entity191 , @entity192 speaking of free food , this 238 - year - old hotel , which is one of the oldest continuously operated inns in the country , is home to a longstanding but little - known tradition that rewards anyone arriving on horseback or via horse and carriage a gratis lunch at one of its three dining venues			0
one local resident even has his own time - honored tradition of showing up with horse and buggy for his comp meal every two years after hitting the voting booth on @entity212			0

@entity213 @entity214 , @entity215 centuries ago , @entity217 royalty called this area of @entity221 home , including @entity222 , who ruled over the land from 1749 to 1794			1
he was known for mastering the ancient sport of @entity225 , which involved jumping feet - first into the ocean from rocky perches up to 400 feet high			0
in honor of the man known as the @entity231 , the @entity221 presents a nightly retelling of his story , which begins with a loincloth - clad warrior lighting torches set at the edge of a lofty promontory and proceeding with a lei offering to the ocean below before taking a daring plunge -- this time headfirst -- into the surf			1
from $ 359 per night			0
@entity240 @entity242 @entity241 as a one - of - a - kind amenity for its guests , this luxury property on popular @entity244 washes every single coin that makes its way into its coffers			1
the custom began in 1938 , when the general manager decided that all silver coins should be cleaned so as to keep the female guests ' white gloves from getting soiled			1
@entity255 , who was the official coin washer until he retired in the late 1980s , is said to have laundered an estimated $ 17 million in change throughout his tenure			0
today , the job belongs to @entity260 , who spends an hour or so each week running the coins through a silver - burnishing machine in a small room behind the registration desk			0
from $ 199 a night			0
