@entity0 -- they are losing the battle over higher taxes on the wealthy , so now @entity5 are threatening a political war next year when it comes time to raise the nation 's debt ceiling			1
with cracks appearing in their anti-tax facade and polls showing most americans favoring president @entity16 's stance in the fiscal cliff negotiations , @entity5 legislators are starting to advocate a tactical retreat to fight another day			1
conservative sen. @entity19 , @entity21 - @entity20 , promised the newly re-elected @entity16 " one hell of a fight " next year if the president forces through his plan for high - income earners to pay more taxes without agreeing to substantive steps to reduce the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt			1
" but there will come a time in february and march where we have to raise the debt ceiling , " @entity19 said tuesday on " @entity32 " on @entity1			1
" i will not raise the debt ceiling ever again until we get significant entitlement reforms , because if we do n't reform entitlements , we 're going to become @entity41 , " adding that the situation presented a chance for @entity16 to lead			1
" but if he does n't lead , there 's going to be one hell of a fight over raising the debt ceiling			1
" survey : 70 % want compromise @entity52 @entity5 leader @entity51 concurred on tuesday , telling reporters that " we are going to insist that we have another discussion about the future of our country in connection with his request of us to raise the debt ceiling			1
" meanwhile , @entity62 and @entity64 speaker @entity63 on tuesday called for @entity16 to make public the specific spending cuts he will offer in a deficit - reduction deal			1
both complained that @entity16 was deliberately holding up progress in negotiations by refusing to provide the details of his cost saving plans			2
" where are the president 's spending cuts ? " asked @entity63 , @entity72 , the lead @entity5 negotiator			1
" the longer the @entity64 slow walks this process , the closer our economy gets to the fiscal cliff			2
" in response , @entity64 spokesman @entity80 said @entity63 and @entity62 were wrong because @entity16 detailed his proposed spending cuts more than a year ago			1
he added that @entity5 negotiators had yet to offer any details of their own on how to raise more revenue from taxes , " and it would be helpful if they did			2
" @entity90 @entity89 , meanwhile , argued that the $ 1 trillion in spending cuts agreed to by @entity92 in the past two years should be counted toward deficit reduction in the current negotiations			0
" where are the cuts ? they 're in bills that you , mr. speaker , have voted for , " @entity89 , @entity97 , said tuesday			0
three weeks remain to cut a deal before the automatic tax increases and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff go into effect on january 1			0
without an agreement during the current lame - duck session of @entity92 , everyone 's taxes will go up , and economists warn the impact of the fiscal cliff could cause another recession			0
@entity16 , @entity63 speak by telephone after @entity5 counter-offer however , the administration has signaled it can delay some of the effects to allow time to work out an agreement when a new @entity92 convenes in january			1
@entity16 has held a campaign - style series of public events to back his call for extending @entity124 - era tax cuts for 98 % of @entity125 while allowing rates to return to higher 1990s levels on income over $ 250,000			1
the issue was central to his re-election in november , and @entity16 made clear on monday that he intended to adhere to his belief that the wealthy must contribute more			2
" i 'm willing to compromise a little bit , " @entity16 said at a @entity133 diesel engine plant			2
however , he said higher tax rates on the the top income brackets was " a principle i 'm not going to compromise on			0
" the president 's public push appears to be working as polls show that most @entity125 back the president 's position			1
a new @entity145 / @entity144 survey on monday said 60 % of respondents supported @entity16 's proposal compared with 38 % who opposed it			2
on tuesday , a @entity151 poll showed that 70 % of adult americans want @entity92 and the @entity64 to reach a compromise that would avoid the fiscal cliff			2
a similar @entity151 poll last week said 62 % wanted compromise			0
the deficit - reduction debate hinges on the tax issue , with republicans opposing any increase in tax rates in their quest to shrink government , while @entity16 and @entity164 want to secure more tax revenue as part of a broader package			2
@entity125 already making big decisions over fiscal cliff both sides call for eliminating tax deductions and loopholes to raise more revenue , but @entity16 also demands an end to the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 for the top brackets			1
@entity5 oppose the return to higher rates , saying it will inhibit job growth because small business owners declare their profits as personal income and therefore would face a tax increase			0
in response , @entity16 and @entity164 note that their plan -- already approved by the @entity52 and needing @entity64 approval to be signed into law by the president -- affects just 2 % of taxpayers and 3 % of small business owners			1
while @entity5 argue those small business owners account for about half of all business income , democrats say that 's because they include law firms , hedge funds traders and other high - income operations			0
@entity16 and @entity63 met face to face on sunday for the first time since november 16			1
it also was their first one - on - one meeting in more than a year , when deficit talks broke down			0
the outline for a deal has become clear in recent weeks			0
both sides agree that more revenue from taxes should be part of the equation , with @entity16 seeking $ 1.6 trillion and @entity5 offering $ 800 billion			1
a source close to the talks said tuesday that the @entity64 had floated the idea of dropping the revenue target to $ 1.2 trillion , then went up to $ 1.4 trillion on monday			0
later , @entity63 spokesman @entity217 said his side made a counteroffer to the @entity64 " that would achieve tax and entitlement reform to solve our looming debt crisis and create more @entity125 jobs			1
" @entity217 also said @entity63 and @entity16 spoke on the phone after the @entity5 proposal was floated			1
@entity227 provided no further details on the counteroffer or the phone conversation , and repeated @entity63 's earlier assertion that @entity5 were waiting for @entity16 to identify specific spending cuts he would be willing to make			1
@entity233 may buy more bonds @entity63 's side wants additional revenue to come from tax reform , such as eliminating some deductions and loopholes , while @entity16 demands the higher rates on income over $ 250,000 for families as part of the equation			1
republicans also seek savings from entitlement programs totaling another $ 800 billion or so , while @entity16 has proposed $ 400 billion in reduced entitlement costs			0
@entity249 would not be included in the president 's plan			0
another sticky issue -- whether the need to raise the federal debt ceiling early next year should be part of the discussion -- also remains unresolved			1
@entity16 says absolutely not , while @entity63 says that any increase in government borrowing to pay its bills must be offset by spending cuts			2
@entity19 's comments this week showed that @entity5 plan to regroup around negotiations to raise the debt ceiling			1
from my home to the house : how to fix the fiscal cliff he noted that @entity16 proposed making permanent a process originated by @entity62 that would allow the president to increase the debt ceiling and @entity92 to then try to block it , an unlikely scenario given @entity164 control of the @entity52			1
" that 's going nowhere , " @entity19 told @entity275 on monday , adding : " he 's not king			0
" however , a top @entity64 @entity278 said that exploiting the debt ceiling for political gain would backfire on republicans			1
" threatening to tank the entire economy , which is what would happen if we ever defaulted on our debt , is not a kind of negotiating strategy that is going to be popular with the @entity125 people , " rep. @entity282 told @entity283 on monday			2
it remains unclear if a deal will happen before the end of the year or if the negotiations will carry over into 2013 , after the fiscal cliff takes effect			0
without action now on the fiscal cliff , the nonpartisan @entity298 estimates that middle - class families would pay about $ 2,000 a year more in taxes			0
even with a deal , revisions in the tax code and other changes would mean everyone pays a bit more starting next year			0
all signs point toward a two - step approach sought by @entity16 , with initial agreement now on some version of his tax plan with targets set for comprehensive negotiations on a broader deficit reduction deal in the new @entity92 next year			2
opinion : generals , get real and cut @entity319 spending such an outcome would put off the main worry of the fiscal cliff , the expiration of the @entity124 - era tax cuts that would result in higher rates for everyone			0
@entity16 and @entity164 say they would then be ready to negotiate significant savings from entitlement programs , while @entity5 say they need to first see commitment on entitlement reforms before accepting any higher tax rates			2
@entity62 , @entity333 , warned on the @entity52 floor on tuesday that " until the president gets specific about cuts , nobody should trust @entity164 to put a dime in new revenue toward real deficit reduction or to stop their shakedown of the taxpayers at the top 2 %			0
" he and @entity63 want @entity16 to take some of the political heat for proposing cuts to entitlement programs and other government spending			2
on tuesday , congressional @entity164 rejected any cuts to the @entity349 health care system for poor and disabled @entity125 as part of a fiscal cliff deal			0
the opposition by @entity164 showed the pressure @entity16 faces from his liberal base to avoid significant changes to the entitlement program that benefits millions			0
some in @entity92 warn that the legislative process will need at least a week to work through potentially complex measures from any proposed deal , meaning there is a de facto deadline of @entity362 at the very latest for negotiators			0
retiring sen. @entity364 , @entity365 , predicted tuesday on @entity283 that a deal would get worked out in a week 's time			0
" it would be wise on their part not to come too quickly with a deal because that would give all the interest groups a chance to get organized and try to kill it , " @entity364 said			0
" and we know that on the right , on the left , special interest groups are just salivating at the chance to attack any agreement because , look , any agreement is going to have controversy attached to it			0
" @entity384 : how will the fiscal cliff affect you ? @entity1 's @entity387 , @entity388 , @entity389 and @entity390 contributed to this report .			0
