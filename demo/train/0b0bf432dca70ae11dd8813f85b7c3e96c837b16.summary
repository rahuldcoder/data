-- fourteen can be a time of total transformation			0
it is an age when gangly adolescent limbs may morph into lithe , stronger ones			2
it is when the first signs of adulthood -- breasts , hair ( on faces and other places ) -- start cropping up			0
@entity13 is also the soonest any child should be tackling on a football field , heading a soccer ball , or body checking an opponent on an ice hockey rink , according to a leading concussion expert			1
" if kids do n't have axillary ( underarm ) or pubic hair , they are n't ready to play , " said dr. @entity21 , a neurosurgeon at @entity22 in @entity23 and author of a new book , " concussion and our kids			1
" " and i have absolutely no problem with parents who want to hold a child out for longer , say 16 or 18			0
" no tackling ? no body checking before 14 ? heading a soccer ball before 14 in soccer might be sacrificed -- if studies eventually bear out the debatable link to concussion -- but tackling and body checking essentially define football and hockey			1
limit hits , limit concussions in young brains in @entity21 's words , " these are sports in which smashing into your opponent is n't just a possibility -- it 's the object of the game			2
" and there is some substance behind the argument for waiting until 14 , says @entity21 , not the least of which is protecting young , developing brains			2
at 14 , he says , several things enhance the body 's ability to protect against head trauma			1
before 14 , there is a size disparity between the head and the body , causing what concussion experts call a " bobble - head " effect -- the head snaps back dramatically after it is hit			1
" our youngsters have big heads on very weak necks and that combination sets up the brain for greater injury , " said @entity21 , a clinical professor of neurosurgery at @entity74			2
however , around age 14 , a child 's skull is about 90 % the size of an adult 's , and the neck and body are strong enough to steel the head against the force of a blow , according to @entity21			1
the more developed the neck muscles , the less dramatically the head ( and thus the brain ) is rocked after a tackle or a body check			1
and then there is the issue of brain development , and a protein called myelin			2
@entity102 acts as insulation , a sort of buffer , for nerve fibers in the brain			1
football player : are you ok ruining a kid 's brain for this game ? by 14 , @entity21 says children have a " better myelin - ated " brain , making them less vulnerable to injury			1
of course , such a bold proposition , one that would effectively change the way sports are played , causes a minor stir among experts			0
" i do n't know what is magic about the number 14 , " said dr. @entity123 , co-director of the @entity124			1
" people suggest radical solutions , but is it practical ? is it going to be done ? " @entity123 acknowledges the debate as complicated			0
on one hand is a real need to protect children , on the other the unavoidable and possibly insurmountable cultural questions that enter the discussion			0
" what does the sporting public want and what is something we can really accomplish ? " said @entity123 , who also is chairman of the @entity139 medical advisory board			0
" as a society , as sporting fans and participants , are we ready to say we 're not going to play football ? " apart from the cultural implications of placing broad limits on contact , there also is the question of what age - specific limits on hitting actually imply about a child 's long - term risk for brain damage			1
there is no definitive set of risk factors for diseases like chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a dementia - like illness that is associated with blows to the head -- although cases as young as 17 have been identified -- and no clues yet from the scientific community about when and precisely how it starts			2
suicide linked to brain disease and then there is the pesky question of science			1
" i would very clearly disagree with the concept that there is research to support ( no contact before age 14 ) , " said dr. @entity174 , chair of the @entity175 of the @entity176			1
" i do n't feel like we need to have all the science lined up before we make policy decisions , but those decisions should be made based on common sense and science rather than randomness			1
" yet even @entity174 has difficulty dismissing the idea outright			0
the reality , he says , is that brains do n't like to be hit a lot and younger brains are still developing , which could cause problems down the road			2
@entity174 says he advocates " diminishing versus outlawing " head contact , adding that waiting to tackle until age 14 sounds arbitrary			1
" some of the sports we 've introduced children to involve hundreds of hits to the head , " said @entity198 , a concussion expert and author of " @entity201			1
" " show me the scientific evidence that that 's a good idea			0
" what everyone seems to agree about is that hits to the developing brain are bad ; that agreement can dissolve once the emotionally charged conversation about the sanctity of sport begins			0
" i would love to debate anyone , anytime , anywhere about this , " said @entity21			0
" what the other side will say is you have to teach the kids the skills of a sport at a very young age otherwise they 're at a competitive disadvantage			1
it 's just plain @entity227 " " i 'm pro-sports			0
i just want them to be played more safely , " said @entity21 , adding that youth athletes have the least - experienced coaches and few medical personnel on the sidelines , putting them at a compelling disadvantage			0
what he wants is for parents to carefully consider the potential long - term consequences of brain blows in their children -- to advocate for their safety			0
" reform should be happening much faster at the youth level than it does , " said @entity198 , who is co-founder of the @entity240 with @entity21			0
" we 're saying wake up , your child has so many disadvantages			0
" your kids only have one life and you should think twice about putting your kid in a sport where they 're hitting their head repeatedly			2
" as for the magic number 14 ? @entity21 says that age matters less than maturity and that parents might even decide to wait until after age 14 to expose their children to contact			1
" the mantra of the book is that no head trauma is good head trauma , " said @entity21			0
the brain can not be conditioned to take head trauma so make it as little as possible			2
" questions lingers about long - term impact of subtle hits to the head			0

concussion expert says kids should n't be tackling , body checking until 14
before 14 , expert says , " bobble head " effect snaps back the brain
@entity102 acts as insulation for nerve fibers in the brain after the age of 14
@entity283 says the age is arbitrary and that science has n't backed up conclusions
