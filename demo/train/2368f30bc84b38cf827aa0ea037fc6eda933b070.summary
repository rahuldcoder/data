" police detained about 100 protesters in the nation 's capital of @entity0 , according to the @entity13			1
the league is one of the main opposition groups that organized the rallies -- unauthorized gatherings that came a day after embattled @entity20 president @entity19 stepped down			2
" we are here once again to tell this government that we want an @entity1 ( that is ) democratic , " one protester told @entity23 television			2
" that 's why we are here today and we will always be , as this power is still here , we will be always here too			2
" more than 3,000 demonstrators , including activists , students , doctors , and parliament members , joined the rally but were blocked by more than 30,000 police officers , said league president @entity37			1
" the police attacked the demonstrators , " @entity37 told @entity2			1
" many activists were beaten and over a hundred were taken into custody , including the parliament members from the @entity45			2
" @entity46 , the league 's general secretary , called the situation " very tense on the ground " and said police were preventing protesters from assembling , with authorities blocking all entrances to the capital			1
" we want this rally to break the wall of fear in the first place , " @entity46 said			2
" and to trigger change in order to reach our legitimate demands , like lifting the emergency law after all these years , liberating media , freedom of political expression			0
" @entity19 's ouster -- fueled by 18 days of angry protests -- was preceded by last month 's overthrowing of @entity72 leader @entity71 @entity70 , helping stoke demands for reform in the @entity76 world			1

experts have said the announcement is a clear attempt by the @entity1 leader to head off the kind of social unrest that toppled @entity70 and @entity19			0
the state of emergency was imposed in 1992 to quell a civil war that eroded the country 's resources and led to what the @entity87 says were the deaths of more than 150,000 people			0
" the @entity121 lasted well over a decade and pitted a corrupt military junta , which had ruled behind the facade of an elected government , against @entity125 who effectively won a popular election in the early 1990s , and were then deprived of power , " a paper by the @entity120 said in december			0
" when civil war broke out , violent extremist elements among these @entity125 quickly came to dominate the fighting , while the military increasingly relied on equally violent repression			0
" however , opponents of the regime say the @entity125 threat has long since diminished and that the law now exists only to muzzle critics of the government			0
