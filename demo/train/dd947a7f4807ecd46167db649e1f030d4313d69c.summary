the poster boy for the @entity1 is n't quite sure he is the right man for the job			1
for once , four - time winners @entity5 or @entity6 are not center stage , and tennis hunk @entity8 has been muscled out in @entity9			1
the face of the fortnight belongs to homegrown hope @entity12 -- the highest ranked @entity14 on the men 's tour			1
wearing fluorescent sneakers , mismatched socks and a sharp haircut , the world @entity17 exudes typical @entity14 surfer cool on court but he has mixed feelings about his new found status			1
" they could have chosen a lot more better - looking people than me , " @entity12 jokes to @entity27 presenter @entity26 in an interview before the first grand slam of the new tennis season started			1
" when i saw myself up on a poster here ... well , it 's just great to be play in front of a home crowd			2
" @entity40 first sent the green and gold clad home fans into a frenzy when he won the @entity1 boys ' singles title in 2013			1
a meteoric 2014 season then saw the @entity49 big - hitter rise from world @entity50 to @entity8 's vanquisher at @entity53			1
@entity12 became the first wild card in a decade to reach the quarterfinals of the grass court grand slam , firing a career high 37 aces past the two - time @entity53 champion and bamboozling him with an array of trick shots			1
tennis experts immediately picked him out as future champion , a successor to @entity14 's last grand slam star @entity65 , winner of the 2002 @entity53 crown			1
" that 's a match i 'm never going to forget , " smiles @entity12 , now ranked as world no. 50			1
" that was the best serving and returning performance i 've had in my life			2
" every time i get out on court i 'm always thinking about it			2
it is confidence and motivation to train hard			0
" when you 're injured , to know that you can play at that level , it 's motivation to get healthy and get back out on the court			0
" that 's a reference to when the @entity14 's season hit the rocks in september because of fatigue and a niggling back injury after his @entity53 whirlwind and a solid third round appearance at the @entity91 ,			1
those injuries might be another reason for @entity12 ' reluctance to get caught up in the hype ahead of the @entity1 , which began in @entity9 , monday			1
his competitive tour return at the @entity97 , five days before the start of the @entity1 , ended in a first round defeat by @entity101 's @entity100			1
the 19 - year - old @entity14 had little time to get match fit for his home grand slam , so a five - set slog past @entity108 's @entity107 was probably not what he needed in the first round			1
one of two @entity14 players to reach round four , @entity12 is determined not to get sucked into the pressure of home expectation			1
" geez , i 'm not going to put too much pressure on myself , " he says			1
" but i 'd love to go out there and make a run like at @entity53			1
" i definitely think i can make an impact if i 'm healthy and feeling good			0
i can definitely match up with some of the best			0
" there is a lot of expectation			0
i 'm still young , i 'm still maturing			0
i understand that it 's a long journey and i 'm ready for that			0
" life on the peripatetic professional tennis tour means the 19 - year - old is getting used to making personal sacrifices			2
he started playing tennis at seven , encouraged by his @entity129 mother @entity128 , who he promised to send a smiley face text to him after his victory over @entity8			1
his @entity134 and older sister @entity133 were in @entity135 to share in his success but his grandmother , who @entity40 describes as " a massive part of my life , " died just a week after his @entity53 breakthrough			2
@entity12 is beginning the new season with the number 74 , in homage to his grandmother , tattooed on his finger			2
" i 'm still trying to deal with some things in my life that have changed , " he explains			0
" sacrificing time at home , grinding out tournaments week after week			2
" i 'm still learning how to deal with being away from friends and family			0
i think i 'm dealing with it pretty well but i 'm still a kid			0
" the @entity14 may only be at the start of his senior career but he is already learning from the best -- his idol , @entity5			2
" if i was to build my game around someone it would be @entity5 , " adds @entity155			0
" he 's the greatest of all time			0
it 's extraordinary how consistent he 's been			0
" i got an opportunity to train with @entity5 in @entity162 for a week last year			0
" it was such a good opportunity to see what he would do on the practice court and his ability to create drills for himself , to develop his game			0
" he 's still striving to get so much better and develop his game			0
that 's what i learned so much from			0
" @entity5 entered the @entity1 as the men 's second seed , behind @entity6 , while @entity12 was relieved of some pressure by being unseeded			1
if he has doubts over this poster boy status , the @entity14 is looking forward to playing the role of crowd pleaser			2
" being able to get the crowd involved , hit shots they 're going to love , that 's what excites me most , " he smiles			0
" playing on courts like the @entity185 , it just gives me goosebumps thinking about it			0
i 'll try to keep the crowd going for as long as i can			0

*teenager* @entity12 is the top - ranked home player at the @entity1
the world @entity190 *fueled* @entity14 fever by knocking @entity8 out of @entity53
@entity12 says he wo n't put pressure on himself at first grand slam of 2015
