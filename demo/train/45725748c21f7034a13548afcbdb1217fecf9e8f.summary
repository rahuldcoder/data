-- you would think surgeon @entity2 might have a lot of doctors and hospitals gunning for him			1
his new book , " @entity8 : what hospitals wo n't tell you and how transparency can revolutionize health care , " is an eye - opening look at the culture of medicine			2
and it 's not pretty			0
@entity2 describes : -- dangerous doctors , who keep practicing because of a code of silence among their colleagues			1
-- " @entity26 " doctors , who are woefully behind the times in their skills , but wo n't tell you			2
-- profit - hungry doctors and hospitals , who take " sales commissions " from drug and medical device companies for using a certain drug , or implanting a certain device in patients			1
hear the stories behind the book on the @entity38 blog but for every doctor who has called him a traitor , @entity2 says , five have thanked him for telling the story behind the statistics , which show that one of every four patients who is hospitalized is harmed by a medical error			1
aside from errors , experts say 20 % to 30 % of medical care is unnecessary			2
@entity2 is a surgeon at @entity49 in @entity50 and a professor at @entity52			1
he says he wrote the book because he wants to change the system from the inside out			0
he does n't think the government can solve the broken health care system , and he does n't think the marketplace can either			0
" it 's the patients who can change it , " he says , by pushing to change the way doctors and hospitals do their jobs			1
patients can do that , he says , by becoming sharp consumers of health care -- the way they might be with any other product or service they buy			0
@entity2 gives some tips on how to do that : -- if you do n't know who 's a good doctor and who 's not , ask hospital employees			2
-- use the @entity79 to learn what you can about your condition , and your options			0
some helpful websites include @entity85 ; @entity86 ; and @entity87			0
-- when a doctor proposes surgery , ask questions : what happens if i do n't do this ? what other options do i have ? what are the risks and the benefits ? -- get a second opinion .			0

a surgeon at @entity49 has some ideas about what is wrong with medicine
@entity2 says doctors and hospitals should talk more openly about medical mistakes
patients should push doctors and hospitals for *information* to make *informed* *decisions*
