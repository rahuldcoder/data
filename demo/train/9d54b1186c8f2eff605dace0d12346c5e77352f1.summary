-- amid the firestorm over the decision to release five @entity6 detainees in exchange for captured @entity9 soldier @entity8 , the @entity2 administration is continuing its efforts to close the controversial prison in @entity12			1
recent efforts to do so are focusing on the establishment of a @entity15 to intermittently decide whether detainees not currently facing charges can be transferred to their home country or to a third - party country willing to take them			2
according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on thursday , the board ensures that detainees are " regularly getting a fresh look , " and getting the chance to have someone hear their case			2
@entity9 law currently does not allow @entity6 detainees to be moved to the @entity9 , a provision that has impeded the administration 's efforts to close the prison , since detainees can not be tried in civilian courts or moved to @entity9 prisons			1
the @entity15 was created by @entity39 in march of 2011 , and was launched in october of last year			0
so far , the board has conducted seven reviews , and three detainees have been approved by it for transfer			2
the board is made up of representatives from the @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , and @entity49 , as well as the @entity50 and the @entity51			2
they review detainees ' histories to determine whether they are likely to represent a continued threat to the @entity9			1
but the decision to approve a detainee for transfer does not lead to their immediate release			0
in fact , of the 149 detainees at the prison , 78 have already been approved for transfer but are still awaiting repatriation			1
most have been in this limbo for more than four years			0
that 's because the @entity9 must first work out a deal with a foreign country willing to take them , and the deal must satisfy certain security and humane treatment obligations , according to the official			1
once a deal has been reached , justification for the release must be submitted to members of congress for a mandatory 30 - day review period			0
the @entity2 administration decided to bypass this stage of the process in the @entity8 case , which has led critics to accuse the administration of violating the law			1
the administration insists it had an obligation to do so because intelligence suggested the @entity8 was in ill health , and might not survive the 30 days			1
moreover , a @entity91 aide took that further , telling @entity0 on condition of not being identified that senators were told by the administration that the @entity9 had credible information that leaked word of the deal ahead of time would result in @entity8 being killed			1
even with approval from government officials and the support of @entity103 , it can be difficult for the @entity9 to find foreign governments willing to take the detainees or able to provide the appropriate assurances			1
the @entity2 administration also has a blanket ban on the transfer of all detainees to @entity110			1
and critics have levied a wave of concerns over recidivism			0
a september 2013 report from the director of national intelligence found that 16.6 % of the approximately 600 released detainees were confirmed to have returned to the battlefield , and another 12.3 % were suspected of having done so			0
still , the administration says it is determined to reduce the @entity121 population , and points to data showing recidivism rates have been on the decline under @entity2			2
" we are very pleased with the progress we have been making , " the senior administration official said , adding that the government was appreciative of efforts by foreign governments to accommodate detainees			0
the official also cited cost as a big motivator , saying , " it simply does not make sense at this point in our history to be spending this type of money " on the prison			0
citing efforts by the @entity144 administration to reduce the detainee population , the official suggested there is room for bipartisan cooperation on transfers			0
more than 500 detainees were released under former president @entity144			0
according to the official , 71 of the @entity6 's remaining detainees have not been approved for transfer			1
of those , 10 are facing trial in front of the military commission system and are therefore ineligible to face the @entity15			0
twenty - three have been referred for prosecution and the remaining 38 remain under detention with no decision made on their status			0
the prison was opened in january of 2002 and has housed over 750 detainees since .			2

@entity9 captive @entity8 was exchanged for @entity167 detainees at @entity6
closing the prison housing terror suspects has long been an @entity2 pledge
battles with @entity103 and other *obstacles* have made shutting it down difficult
