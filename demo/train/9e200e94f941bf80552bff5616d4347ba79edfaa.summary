the staggering number of checks -- an average of almost three per second , nearly three times the daily average -- falls on the shoulders of 600 @entity6 and contract call center employees who will endure 17 - hour workdays in an attempt to complete the background reviews in three business days , as required by law , @entity6 spokesman @entity7 said			1
" traditionally , @entity21 is one of our busiest days for transaction volume , " @entity20 said			1

the highest day on record was december 21 , 2012 , with more than 177,000 background checks			1

employees of the background check agency , who work every day but @entity40 , worked through the weekend to vet friday 's purchases			2
" we are averaging three checks per second , " @entity20 said friday afternoon , before the final numbers were in			2
" the challenge is to have staff keep up with this volume			0
we do that by limiting personal leave , asking employees to work extra shifts and reutilizing former ... employees to serve in @entity33 during this busy period			0
" the agency brings in 100 extra employees to deal with the increase			2

the check sometimes involves calling courthouses to get records and dispositions			0
" we wo n't make a determination unless we are absolutely sure , " @entity20 said			0
