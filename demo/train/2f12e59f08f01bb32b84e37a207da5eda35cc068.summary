@entity0 , @entity1 -- the city of @entity4 and the @entity1 government are embroiled in a dispute -- again -- over who owns one of the world 's most famous statues , @entity11			1
the issue has been simmering for years			0
the @entity4 mayor 's office said the debate began in the early 1990 , and the city 's various mayors have brought it up from time to time			2
it 's mainly about the bottom line -- some 8 million euros a year in ticket sales at @entity4 's @entity21 , also simply known as @entity22 or the @entity23 , where @entity11 is displayed			1
that money , however , goes to the @entity1 government , and not the city			1
@entity4 mayor @entity27 recently asked that @entity11 's earnings go to @entity4 instead , because " after all , the @entity11 is ours , " ' said one of his press officers			1
while tourism brings money to @entity4 , it also brings a lot of costs , such as cleaning and security , said the press officer			2
the mayor does not feel it 's fair that the burden of maintaining the city and its centuries - old buildings should fall solely on its citizens			0
following the request , the @entity44 commissioned a study to determine who is the rightful owner of @entity11			2
the ministry 's lawyers recently concluded that according to documents they found in archives , @entity11 belongs to @entity1 , not the city of @entity4			1
the government bases that assumption on the fact that @entity1 paid for @entity11 to be moved from its original spot , in central @entity4 's @entity57 , to @entity58 , according to @entity27 's press officer			1
@entity60 , president of the @entity61 , said in a statement monday that " the opinion of the @entity68 lawyers is very dangerous , " noting all of the city 's " heritage " that fills state museums			0
he points out that @entity4 's city hall commissioned and paid for the statue 's creation in the 16th century			2
it stood at the @entity57 for nearly four centuries , until 1873 , when it was moved to @entity22 in order to better preserve it			0
when @entity1 was unified in 1871 , the @entity57 was returned to @entity4 under law , he said			2
@entity60 said his records show the new @entity0 - based @entity1 government paid to move @entity11 because it took the responsibility of " tutelage " over the new nation 's heritage			1
" the state did not for sure want to lay claim to the ownership of the @entity11 given two years ' prior law , " he said			0
" instead , it wanted to carry out a tutelage function , which is part of its competence to this day and by which the city of @entity4 had agreed to place the @entity11 at the @entity23			1
" many of the paintings and statues in @entity1 - run @entity4 museums such as the @entity95 belong to the city , @entity60 said			1
some of the proceeds should be given to @entity4 , he said : " the city of @entity4 has the right to partake in the profits			2
" @entity100 , who was a native of @entity4 , completed the sculpture in 1504			0
it has been a symbol of @entity4 's defiance against its enemies ever since			0
@entity27 told the @entity4 daily newspaper @entity108 " with all due respect to the @entity68 lawyers , the incontestable documents held in possession by the state administration are clear : the @entity11 belongs to the city of @entity4			1
" the @entity112 's @entity111 indicated in a statement monday he is not ready to hand over ownership of the statue			0
@entity111 said he found himself embroiled in " an absurd and inopportune " dispute about the statue " against ( his ) will			0
" his statement referred to the question of the statue 's ownership as " a petty matter " -- but one that also should " be addressed in a sharing , planning manner			0
" he said he would work with @entity4 representatives in such a manner , with a goal of avoiding controversy .			0

the city of @entity4 and the @entity1 government are in dispute
who owns @entity11 ?
the issue is who gets the 8 million euros tickets generate each year
