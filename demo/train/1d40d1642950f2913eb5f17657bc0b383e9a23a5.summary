-- there have been 108 goals scored in this @entity3			1
@entity4 has scored a total of 0			1
and yet , if things go its way today , it could make it to the knockout round			0
that 's one of five things we 'll be watching for and talking about tuesday : 1			1
@entity14 leaving on a jet plane : what a terrible , horrible , no good , very bad @entity3 it 's been for @entity17			1
sure , @entity18 scored that goal that had eluded him for three @entity20			2
but to what end ? the @entity17 still had their feast spoiled by @entity23 last week			1
today , @entity17 is hoping for at least a draw -- so it does n't leave with a goose egg for the first time			1
( @entity27 is already through			0
) update : well , @entity17 got its draw			1
but not a win or even a goal			2
the result meant @entity27 -- predicted by many to finish last in @entity34 -- instead came in first			0
@entity35 right down the line : this is the match to watch today			0
both @entity23 and @entity38 have 3 points in @entity40 is crucial for moving on up			1
here 's hoping the @entity42 coach gave the team a refresher course on staying onside			2
in its game with @entity27 , the @entity42 boys were caught offside 11 times ! fix that , and make opportunities for magic man @entity52 , and @entity38 may make it through			1
but watch out ! something 's gotten into @entity23			1
after a stunning loss to @entity27 , they were sizzling hot against @entity17 -- especially with the return of injury - plagued @entity58			1
update : @entity38 is out of the @entity3 , and it 's got to hurt in more ways than one			1
first , there 's their 1 - 0 loss to @entity23			1
but what everyone is talking about is star @entity66 striker @entity58 allegedly biting the shoulder of @entity42 defender @entity68 a few minutes before the game 's lone goal			1
@entity71 @entity72 all it takes is one : we get it , @entity4			1
you 're really great at defense			0
you proved that when you played with 10 players for most of the match with @entity81 , and still held them to a goalless draw			2
but it 's time to aim for the net now			2
like @entity4 , the @entity72 has n't ever made it to the @entity86			1
a win will change that			0
@entity89 and @entity90 have decided to stay with the squad as they mourn the death of another sibling , @entity93 , who passed away of cancer last week			0
update : @entity4 did it			1
they scored two goals , the last on a penalty kick in extra time to earn a 2 - 1 win and a berth in the knockout stages			1
the result also assured an end to the @entity3 hopes of @entity107 , @entity108 and their @entity72 cohorts			1
@entity111 @entity110 tangled up in blue : we want to love @entity81			0
they have the nicest fans			0
but the @entity115 have been meh			0
and we 're not sure they have a fighting chance today			0
they not only have to win against @entity120 , they 'll also have to hope that the @entity72 draws or loses the other game			1
@entity120 's sitting pretty at the top of the group			1
but we want to see their 22 - year - old phenom , @entity125 , score again			0
because that dude can give @entity128 a run for her money ( maker )			2
update : @entity120 has been unstoppable up until tuesday			1
against @entity4 , they gave their fans more reason to dance -- four goals worth , in fact , en route to a 4 - 1 win and a spot atop @entity141 5			1
@entity143 's recaps @entity145 - @entity144 : 3 - 1 the scouting report goes something like this : @entity149 is the target player for @entity145 on corner kicks			2
mark him with two players if you have to			0
he 'll make you pay if he gets his head to the ball			0
@entity144 missed that page and now @entity145 is moving on to the next round while the @entity158 are going home			0
@entity149 scored @entity145 's opener and assisted on the second			2
and if that was n't enough to watch the game , the @entity164 coach 's priceless expressions sure were			1
@entity168 - @entity167 : 4 - 1 if you 've been watching @entity170 play this @entity3 , know that you 're witnessing a legend in the making : @entity173			2
he scored his fourth goal in three games and booked his country a date with @entity178			2
just two more goals and he 'll be the top scorers in the tournament so far			2
and he 's only 22			2
@entity182 - @entity178 : 2 - 0 @entity184 fans wear their emotions on their sleeves , and their shoulders , and on their faces			0
so , losing to the @entity189 made you just want to give them all a big hug			0
and then remind them : stop it , you 're in the next round			0
the @entity182 showed again they can be @entity197 as @entity198 , in the counterattack , with the insightful cross to @entity201 , put @entity178 away			0
" it was a very good game to watch , " @entity198 said afterward			0
well , maybe for your team			0
@entity205 - @entity204 : 3 - 0 where was this @entity205 all this time ? three goals ! that 's two more than all the goals it scored in its other @entity3 games combined this year			1
this is how a defending champ should play			0
but clearly , @entity205 got the memo too late			0
it was the last international match for @entity218 , who spent the last two games on the bench watching @entity205 lose			0
he went out in style yesterday			0
@entity0 's @entity222 contributed to this report .			0
