-- it 's " very likely " that @entity6 leader @entity5 's powerful uncle , @entity4 , has been removed from his top - level position in government , two @entity2 lawmakers said tuesday , citing a briefing from their country 's intelligence service			1
and two close allies of @entity4 -- @entity13 and @entity14 -- have been publicly executed , one of the @entity2 lawmakers said at a news conference			1
the lawmakers , including @entity19 of the governing @entity20 , said this after receiving what they said was a briefing from @entity2 's @entity24			2
@entity0 has not been able to independently confirm the report			0
@entity4 was the brother - in - law of @entity6 's previous ruler , @entity5 's father , @entity27			1
when the elder @entity5 died and the son succeeded him , analysts told @entity0 that @entity4 would be a power behind the throne as the younger @entity5 took control of the reclusive nation			1
@entity4 was the vice chairman of @entity6 's top military body and has often been pictured beside @entity5			1
his removal would mark a major upheaval in @entity6 's leadership since @entity5 succeeded his father , who died in in 2011			1
some have said he may have been at the heart of an internal palace struggle , one which might have put him even at odds with his own wife , @entity44 , according to a @entity47 report two years ago			0
" if this is in fact true , the implications are pretty profound , " said @entity48 , a @entity49 analyst at @entity51 's @entity50			2
" some see this as perhaps the last part of the power consolidation phase , that @entity5 has in fact removed all of the old guard close to his father and is now finalizing the inserting of his own inner group , " @entity48 told @entity0			1
but he said @entity4 " was seen as a force of stability " by @entity66 , @entity6 's leading ally			1
" i think there will be a lot of concern in @entity70 right now , " @entity48 said			0
@entity4 cultivated extensive business ties with @entity66 , so his removal " also has implications in terms of making money for the regime			2
" but he said other analysts suspect @entity4 , who had fallen from favor several years ago for building his own patronage network , may have been caught trying to rebuild that system , resulting in his ouster			0
it has previously been reported that @entity82 -- father of @entity27 and architect of the @entity6 state -- disapproved of @entity4 's marriage into the family , according to @entity47			2
@entity6 , a state shrouded in secrecy , is involved in a protracted standoff with its neighbors and @entity91 powers over its nuclear weapons program			0
tensions between @entity94 soared this year as @entity95 reacted angrily to tightened @entity97 sanctions imposed in response to its latest nuclear test			0
the two sides are still technically at war after the 1950 - 1953 @entity102 ended in a mere truce , not a treaty			0
@entity0 's @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity107 in @entity108 and journalist @entity109 in @entity110 contributed to this report .			0
