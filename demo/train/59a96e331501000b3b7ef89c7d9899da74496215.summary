-- how will @entity1 affect hurricane season ? it depends on the ocean , forecasters say			1
forecasters announced thursday that the @entity8 hurricane season likely will have fewer storms than the average year , while in the @entity11 , the numbers might be higher			1
the outlook from the @entity13 forecast three to six hurricanes , with one or two major hurricanes for the @entity8 season , which begins june 1			2
there likely will be eight to 13 named storms in the @entity8			2
" it does n't matter whether we get one or a dozen , it matters which one ( s ) hit land and what land it hits , " @entity0 meteorologist and severe weather expert @entity19 said			1
about 40 % of @entity27 live in counties on a shoreline , said @entity30 , the assistant administrator for @entity32 's @entity31			0
@entity1 , characterized by warmer water in the equatorial @entity11 , increases strong wind shear in the @entity8 , which reduces the intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes and prevents other systems from becoming powerful enough to be named storms			1
the @entity8 is also cooler than in recent years			2
" we are currently seeing strong trade winds and wind shear over the tropical @entity8 , and @entity32 's climate models predict these conditions will persist , in part because of @entity1 , " said @entity40 , @entity32 's lead hurricane season forecaster			1
the @entity8 hurricane season runs through november 30			2
the region includes the @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity8			0
last year there were 11 tropical storms and two hurricanes			0
the center said there was a 70 % chance there would be 14 to 20 named storms for the @entity11 , with seven to 11 hurricanes , with the likelihood of three to six being category 3 hurricanes or stronger ( winds greater than 100 mph )			1
that would be near normal or above normal			0
" @entity1 decreases the vertical wind shear over the eastern tropical @entity11 , favoring more and stronger tropical storms and hurricanes , " @entity40 said			1
it is extremely rare for an @entity11 hurricane to affect the @entity27 mainland , though some do have an influence on @entity71			0
the @entity11 hurricane season runs from may 15 through november 30			0
last year there were nine tropical storms and nine hurricanes			0
there is a 65 % chance of an @entity1 forming , the center said on may 8 .			0

there is a *possibility* of more hurricanes in the @entity11 , fewer in the @entity8 , forecasters say
winds from @entity1 should lessen the intensity of storms in the @entity8
what counts is how many storms make *landfall* and where they hit , @entity0 meteorologist says
