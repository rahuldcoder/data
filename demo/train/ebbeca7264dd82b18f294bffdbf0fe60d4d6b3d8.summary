as the stars and stripes billowed in the @entity7 wind , @entity4 produced one of the most monumental triumphs in sporting history			1
for a team which had stared into the abyss , trailing 8 - 1 at one stage , @entity4 did what nobody outside of its catamaran believed it could do			1

the 69 - year - old , whose personal fortune is estimated at $ 41 billion by @entity42 , boarded the boat to take part in the celebrations following a titanic tussle			1
the @entity24 is the oldest trophy in international sport -- but rarely has sailing 's pinnacle event ever been so dramatic			1
it speaks volumes that even those who had barely heard of the event last week suddenly became hooked on a race which has been going since 1851			2
and yet this contest should have been all over before wednesday 's fantastic finale with @entity57 having stormed into an 8 - 1 lead			1
in fact , the challenger should have wrapped up the title with victory in race 13 only for it to be abandoned with its yacht just two minutes from the finish line because of a time limit rule			2
when the race was rescheduled , @entity4 picked up the win which kept its hopes of a historic comeback alive			1

racing in @entity93 catamarans , the first time these boats have been used in the competition , the crews expect to sail at around 40 knots or 74 kilometers an hour			2

only last march , @entity98 sailor @entity97 died after being trapped under a catamaran in an @entity24 training session with @entity102 team @entity101			2
last october , the @entity4 team came perilously close to an accident of their own , while the @entity106 boat has also had its own share of scary moments			2
but this past fortnight has brought sailing to the forefront of world sport with @entity4 's miraculous fightback set to go down as one of the greatest of all time			1
with both teams needing to win the race to get its hands on the trophy , a tight fought affair was expected			2
but despite a good start from @entity57 , it was the reigning champion which dominated			0
led by @entity98 's four time olympic gold medalist @entity124 , who replaced @entity125 as the team tactician with the score at 4 - 1 , @entity4 roared back in dramatic fashion			1
@entity129 is the first @entity130 to experience victory at the event since @entity133 led the @entity135 team @entity136 to three consecutive victories in 1899 , 1901 and 1903			0
the champagne was in full flow by the time @entity4 made it back to dry land with fans in raptures at the side of the port			1
" it really is all about the team , " added @entity27			0
" on your own you 're nothing , the team make you look great			0
