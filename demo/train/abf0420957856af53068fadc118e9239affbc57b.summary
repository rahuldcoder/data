in a few weeks , the @entity0 will begin the second round of @entity3 tests			1
earlier this spring , thousands of students refused to take the @entity3 @entity5 ( @entity5 ) exams			1
in @entity10 , as in states across the country , parents are telling administrators that their children will not sit for exams that pressure teachers to teach to the test and drain school budgets			1
ignore the baseless charge that families do n't want high academic standards for their kids or are afraid their kids wo n't live up to higher standards			0
parents and students want schools that offer a well - rounded curriculum and a sensible amount and way of testing			1
but the @entity3 seems to focus too much on testing			1
according to the 2014 @entity31 , parents may eventually review students ' responses to open - ended questions , but they are not allowed to look at the test itself			1
although educators are under a gag order from @entity45 and @entity46 that prohibits them from discussing specifics of the tests , principal @entity37 of @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 , and other educators across the state have decried the @entity5 exams as confusing and developmentally inappropriate			0
the situation may be the same in mathematics			0
@entity53 professor @entity52 argues that the @entity3 math standards do not command international respect and will not prepare students for @entity58 careers			1
if the state keeps hiding the exams from public scrutiny , then parents and educators have a right to doubt their pedagogical value			1
the @entity69 program awarded @entity10 $ 700 million on the condition that the state adopts a value added modeling teacher evaluation system , in this case , @entity75			1
put plainly -- the state may now fire teachers if test scores are low			1
that creates incredible pressure to teach to the test			2
additionally , @entity83 language learners must also take the tests , regardless of how well they can understand them , and teachers in impoverished school districts are more likely to be punished , despite taking on harder assignments			2
in the words of noted education scholar @entity91 : @entity92 is a sham			0
i recently attended an @entity96 rally held on @entity97			0
the poster for the event juxtaposes two silhouettes of a child 's head : one , under the title " learning , " is filled with images of @entity105 , a guitar , a flower , math equations and plants			0
the other , under the title " testing , " is filled with a multiple - choice exam			2
that is why parents are refusing -- they want school to be a place where children 's talents are cultivated and not harmed by tests whose main use is to fire teachers			1
in 1849 , the @entity129 philosopher @entity128 wrote a classic essay on civil disobedience that has inspired countless activists around the world , including @entity134 and @entity135 according to @entity128 , " it is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law , so much as for the right			0
" according to @entity128 , people are too inclined to respect the government rather than question whether the people who lead it are acting justly			0
today , a parent inspired by @entity128 would point out that the @entity142 is led by fallible human beings such as @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 , and the tests are created by @entity46 , a corporation that has been found to use its nonprofit foundation to produce curriculum materials and software for its for - profit business			2
such a parent would also object to the @entity155 's policy that " schools do not have any obligation to provide an alternative location or activities for individual students while the tests are being administered			0
" this sentence justifies the sit - and - stare policy whereby refusing children are not allowed to read or talk , but are forced to remain at their desks while their peers take the tests			2
in other words , this manual encourages administrators to employ the " silent treatment " on kids who do n't want their education to become endless test prep			2
this is bullying pure and simple			0
as a parent , what would you do if you wanted to refuse the upcoming math test for your child ? write a letter or e-mail to the board of education , superintendent , principals and teachers in your school district to formally notify them of your decision to refuse to allow your child to participate in any local assessments tied to @entity75 for the 2013 - 2014 school year			1
tell them that you want your child to be scored as a " refusal " with a final score of " 999 " and a standard achieved code of 96 , on all state testing			0
this ensures that schools and teachers are not impacted by the refusals			0
there is a chance that administrators will try to dissuade you			0
tell them that you are advocating for your children to receive a well - rounded , personalized education			1
tell everyone in your district that you are not fighting him or her , but rather political and corporate forces that are trying to centralize and standardize public education .			0

in @entity10 , as in other states , some parents oppose the @entity3 exams
@entity215 : @entity3 seems to focus too much on testing
he says teachers should not have to teach to the test and drain school budgets
@entity215 : children should receive a well - rounded curriculum and education
