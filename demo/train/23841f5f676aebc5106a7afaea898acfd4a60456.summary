-- in the star - studded world of supergroups , where musical acumen and bloated egos often co-exist , it 's not unheard of band members to not talk to each other			2
but in the case of @entity14 , the all - star band consisted of renowned @entity16 and @entity17 musicians , the reason for the group 's lack of verbal communication is much more straightforward : the band 's members simply do n't understand each other 's language			1
" we can not even speak together on stage , " says kora maestro @entity22 , one of @entity16 's premier musicians and a member of @entity14			1
" music has created its own language -- it 's the music message , and i think the message is true to the audiences [ and ] to the world also at the same time			0
" united by the universal language of music , the members of @entity14 , which also include legendary @entity17 musician @entity33 and @entity16 griot singer @entity34 blend the desert - inspired sounds of @entity39 with @entity17 's soul - stirring grooves			1
for @entity42 , one of @entity39 's most revered musicians , this is not the first time he fuses different sounds to break down musical barriers			1
the masterful musician is well - known internationally for his daring and innovative musical partnerships -- his long list of collaborators include @entity52 , @entity53 and the @entity54			0

" this meeting is like fighting but in a positive way			0
the old musicians from @entity16 , the old stars , it 's like , ' ok , i 'm here , i 'm playing , ' and the @entity17 also say the same			2
so , we take care of our culture , they are taking care of their culture ... so we put the both music together to become a new music			0
" yet , this cultural crossover took years to become a reality -- back in 1996 , a group of @entity16 musicians were invited to @entity76 to record with @entity17 singers and musicians			2
the musicians from @entity39 , however , never made it to @entity17 -- visa problems , lost passports or better - paid concerts elsewhere have all been cited as reasons over the years			1

the resulting album , the now - famous " @entity98 , " went on to become a global hit , winning several music awards and selling millions of albums			0
but some 14 years later , the @entity16 and @entity17 musicians finally got a chance to play and record together in @entity103 , @entity104			0
their 2010 long - awaited studio offering received a @entity107 nomination last year for " @entity108			1
" the band is currently on their second @entity111 tour , spreading their vibrant sounds to new audiences			0
on stage , @entity42 's masterful playing shines though as he brings the unique sound of the kora , a 21 - string harp - like instrument from @entity39 , to the forefront			1
" i tried to open a new door for the kora in the world , " he says			0
" today , i 'm very happy the kora can fit on electronic music , fit in folk music , blue grass , it 's fantastic			0

his mission today is to keep the thrilling sound of the kora alive , expanding its reach beyond the continent			1
" @entity17 and @entity16 , we are two number one culture countries in the world , " says @entity22			2
" in the 1960s a lot of countries in @entity39 got their independence and we had a very good relation with @entity17 -- musicians from @entity16 were taken from @entity16 , going to @entity17 to study how to write and to read the music -- not to play the music because we already knew how to play the music -- and we still have this kind of relation still running about culture and style			2
" watch : @entity16 kora master @entity42 at work @entity22 says @entity14 songs prove once again that music has the power to bring people together			1
" we are singing about love , we are singing about peace , we are singing about understanding and respect and spirituality , " he says			0
" they [ @entity17 musicians ] are happy 200 % in what they are playing when we play together and we , from @entity16 , are happy 200 % too -- we are enjoying , we are playing and then audience sees more and you can see in the face of the audience -- [ they are ] happy , very happy , dancing , enjoying themselves			0
