-- big spending @entity1 paid the price for the indiscretion of their fans last season when held to a goalless draw by @entity9 in @entity10 friday			1
@entity12 's men were playing in an empty @entity13 as punishment for scenes at their final home game of the 2012/13 campaign when flares where thrown and the pitch invaded			2
lacking atmosphere , @entity1 's players could find no inspiration after 2 - 0 wins over @entity24 and a 4 - 1 thumping of @entity26 in their opening matches			1
@entity28 , scorer of four goals in those games , and big money signing @entity33 drew blank , but the former did go close twice against his old side in the first half			0
a shot from @entity38 which struck the crossbar late on was the closest @entity1 came to scoring but they will top the @entity42 standings ahead of the weekend fixtures			2
@entity1 were taken over by @entity45 billionaire @entity44 and his cash injection saw them promoted from @entity48 to become one of the favorites for the title this term after bringing in a clutch of star players , including @entity33 from @entity55			2
@entity44 was among the few people allowed to watch friday night as well as @entity1 's @entity57 , who saw a game played out in a surreal atmosphere			0
meanwhile , @entity60 went three points clear at the top of the @entity63 with a 1 - 0 home win over @entity65			1
last season 's @entity67 finalists made it three wins from three games thanks to a goal from prolific @entity74 striker @entity73			0
he met @entity77 's cross in the 55th minute to score the only goal of the game			0
@entity63 and @entity81 champions @entity82 can draw level on points with a win over @entity86 saturday			0
@entity60 had the better of the match from the start , inflicting @entity65 's first defeat under new coach @entity90 .			1

@entity60 beat @entity65 1 - 0 in @entity63
@entity73 with the opener at @entity94
