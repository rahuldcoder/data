@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 said sunday his administration has mounted a " relentless response " to the oil spill unleashed by the sinking of an offshore drill rig in the @entity9			1
@entity3 met with local , state and federal officials involved in the cleanup in southeastern @entity1 , the closest stretch of coastline threatened by the massive spill			1
afterward , he said that despite " the most advanced technology available , " the spill may not be stopped for many days			2
" i 'm not going to rest , and none of the gentlemen and women who are here are going to rest or be satisfied , until the leak is stopped at the source , the oil on the @entity9 is contained and cleaned up and the people of this region are able to go back to their lives and their livelihoods , " he said			2
" we will spare no resource to clean up whatever damage is caused			1
" @entity3 met with the commandant of the @entity33 , adm. @entity34 ; @entity36 administrator @entity35 ; @entity1 gov. @entity39 ; and the presidents of several parish governments after arriving , @entity38 spokesman @entity37 said			1
the president 's briefing included an update on the procedures being attempted to cap the well and the economic and environmental impact of the spill , @entity37 said			1
after landing in @entity50 , @entity1 , on sunday , @entity3 joined @entity39 on a two - hour drive to @entity0 , a staging ground for efforts to fight the growing slick			1
appearing on @entity2 's " @entity57 , " homeland security secretary @entity55 , interior secretary @entity56 and @entity34 warned that the leaking oil from a rig explosion could continue for weeks with dire consequences			2
" it potentially is catastrophic , " @entity56 said			0
" i think we have to prepare for the worst			0
" that would mean oil damaging sensitive coastal wetlands and industries , including a vital fishing sector that was damaged by @entity68 in 2005			0
@entity3 initially planned to fly over the affected area by helicopter , but weather conditions prevented the flight			1
before his trip , @entity74 officials warned he would find a dire situation			0
officials warn of possible catastrophe @entity56 blamed the explosion that caused the spill on a failure in rig technology intended to prevent so - called blowouts			1
" there is no doubt at all here that what has happened is the blowout prevention mechanism at the bottom of the well ... is defective , " @entity56 said			0
" while there have been blowouts in the past , we have never seen anything that has been quite of this magnitude			0
" the well is owned by oil company @entity95			1
@entity95 , president of @entity95 , told @entity98 's " @entity97 " that the company does n't know why the blowout preventer failed			1
all three officials interviewed by @entity2 repeatedly emphasized that @entity95 is legally responsible for spill and clean - up efforts			1
they avoided direct criticism of the company , but said @entity95 must do more to try to cap the gushing well			1
@entity34 called the spill " one of the most complex things we 've ever dealt with , " and said it was impossible so far to predict how much oil will eventually leak			2
" if we lost a total well head , it could be 100,000 barrels or more a day , " he said			0
@entity95 said two @entity1 communities , @entity0 and @entity117 , will likely be the first places hit by the oil slick			1
nearly 1 million feet of booms have been deployed in an effort to protect precious estuaries and wildlife , even as thousands of barrels of crude oil continued gushing into the water			0
drilling new wells to stop the flow would take a month or two , and it was unclear if the leak could be contained or slowed before then			0
@entity131 : @entity132 to save @entity133 @entity134 said the company is building a containment system to prevent the leaking oil from spreading , but it may take another six to eight days to deploy it			0
meanwhile , the company is working to battle the slick offshore and to clean up any oil that reaches the coast			2
" we 're still working hard , still working hard on the blowout preventer and see if we can actuate this piece of evidently failed equipment , " he said			0
but he compared that to " doing open - heart surgery at 5,000 feet in the dark with robot - controlled submarines			0
" sen. @entity152 and rep. @entity153 , both of @entity1 , said they want the government to put more pressure on @entity95 to find a solution			1
" our government needs to get somewhere between ' drill , baby , drill ' and ' spill , baby , spill , ' " @entity153 said on @entity159 ' " @entity158			2
" @entity152 told the same program that the government should force @entity95 to immediately start drilling remedial wells at the site " and hope that one can fix this			1
" the slick has already taken a toll on life along the @entity174 , bringing fishing and tourism to a halt in many places and threatening to cripple those industries for weeks to come			0
" i 'm pretty much on pause right now			0
... it 's just a big waiting game , " said @entity182 , a fisherman who operates boat trips for tourists out of @entity0			1
@entity131 : oil spill causes empty shrimp nets @entity34 noted @entity95 was deploying its top technology such as the remote operation vehicles , which the government does n't have			1
at the same time , @entity191 and @entity56 said the @entity3 administration had reacted quickly to what they called an escalating situation			1
@entity191 noted the incident was first an explosion and fire , with a search - and - rescue effort for missing rig workers			0
it then worsened when the rig sank two days later , followed by the increasing oil leak , she said			0
while @entity95 was the first responder , the @entity33 reacted right away to the situation and deployed 70 vessels and 1 million feet of boom for possible service , @entity191 said			1
@entity56 noted that the @entity3 administration has ordered inspections of " blowout preventers " on other @entity9 rigs			2
the government 's job was to " keep the boot on the neck " of @entity95 to ensure it meets its obligations in stopping the spill , dealing with the oil slick and paying for all costs and damages			1
also on the @entity2 program sunday , @entity224 's @entity223 @entity222 candidate @entity221 called the oil slick a " crisis " but withheld judgment on the administration 's response			0
according to @entity221 , it appeared that much of the early information provided to the federal government by @entity95 had been " either inaccurate or shortcoming			2
" in recent days , @entity221 said , " we 've seen the administration move aggressively , and i hope aggressively enough			0
" @entity95 partnered with government officials to hold town hall meetings throughout the region saturday to respond to concerns about the spill 's consequences			1
but @entity1 gov. @entity39 suggested the response to the oil slick has so far been inadequate			1
" we continue to be concerned with @entity95 's ability to respond to this incident , " he said			2
environmentalist @entity249 of the @entity251 organization said the oil leak could cause damage that would last decades			2
" this event is a self - feeding fire , " @entity249 said			0
" it is so big and expanding so fast that it 's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective			0
" you 're looking at a long - term poisoning of the area , " he said			0
" ultimately , this will have a multidecade impact			2
" the oil spill started april 20 , after an explosion on the @entity95 contractor @entity270 's @entity269 drilling platform			1
eleven oil - rig workers remain missing and are presumed dead			0
the rig sank april 22 about 50 miles off the southeast coast of @entity1 , and the untapped wellhead is gushing oil into the @entity9			0
about 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion , the @entity33 said saturday .			0

new : president @entity3 briefed on procedures used to cap well , impact of the spill
@entity286 : " we will spare no resource to clean up whatever damage is caused , " @entity3 says
gov. @entity39 : residents can see the spill , which @entity95 could not contain last week
@entity0 and @entity117 expected to be the first areas affected
