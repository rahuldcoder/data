@entity0 , @entity1 -- where are the lost boys of @entity5 ? that 's what many people , in that country and around the world , want to know			1
the answer could say much about the new narrative that has been pushed about the country			0
this week , @entity13 , @entity5 's attorney general , issued arrest warrants for three people in connection with a shocking case that has captured the attention of the entire country : the disappearance of 43 students , who went missing after being confronted by police			1
more than four dozen people have been arrested , including police officers , local officials and members of a drug gang			0
for residents of the small town of @entity31 , which lies 120 miles southwest of @entity32 , the nightmare began on september 26 — just 10 days after the festivities celebrating @entity5 's @entity34			1
that 's when a group of young men , between the ages of 18 and 25 , who were studying at a nearby teachers college , traveled to @entity31 to protest what they claimed were the school 's discriminatory hiring practices			2
@entity5 prosecutors believe a small - town mayor named @entity46 and his wife , @entity49 @entity48 , might know the students ' whereabouts			1
unfortunately , we ca n't find out for sure because the couple is on the run			2
also missing is the town 's former police chief , @entity56			1
the investigation of the case has prompted speculation that @entity62 was so worried that the students might disrupt his wife 's speech that he ordered @entity67 to have police officers confront the students and stop the protest			1
( according to @entity13 , another protest had previously upset @entity62 )			0
police reportedly opened fire on the vehicles in which the students were traveling			2
six people were killed , and the 43 students went missing			1
eyewitnesses told prosecutors they saw the young men being crammed into police cars			0
according to the attorney general , the police quickly turned the students over to @entity85 , a local drug trafficking gang			2
the prosecutor claimed that @entity62 and his wife keep bad company			2
@entity48 's brothers are suspected drug traffickers			2
and , according to the attorney general , the first lady of @entity31 has been called " the main operator of criminal activities " in the town			2
the leader of @entity85 told officials that , once police turned over the students , he ordered his henchmen to make them disappear			2
the attorney general said the young men were loaded onto a pickup truck and driven to a remote location populated by mass graves			0
and that 's where the story ends — for now			0
since this is @entity5 we 're talking about , where people do n't trust their government and always assume there is a backstory , some people wo n't accept the official version of events			1
in fact , these days , young people in @entity5 hold hearings in a new court of public opinion : @entity123 and @entity124			1
and , on social media , the current debate is whether this mass abduction was , as the attorney general says , a case of criminal misconduct by a rogue local official or something more nefarious			0
was the federal government involved ? or was it at least aware that this was happening ? this being @entity5 , one has to ask			1
after all , this is the land of the desaparecidos			0
in the 1970s , there were at least 2,000 documented cases of people who simply disappeared after challenging government officials			0
those people were never found , and the cases never solved			0
even if this is an isolated incident — and that 's a big " if " given how closely intertwined drug gangs are with @entity5 officials — the blame is n't limited to the individuals who have been arrested or are being sought			1
it extends to the @entity5 people , many of whom long ago made a devil 's bargain with the drug traffickers who are threatening to tear the country apart			1
they built altars to @entity162 , the patron " saint " of drug lords , wrote corridos ( folkloric ballads ) praising the exploits of traffickers , and accepted the fruits of an illicit trade			0
the reality is that the modern @entity5 drug dealer is n't living in a camp in the mountains			1
he 's a @entity177 - speaking version of @entity178			0
he lives in the suburbs , drives a @entity180 , and spends weekends attending his kids ' soccer games — which are played on a field that he built			0
it 's no wonder that , when former @entity5 president @entity186 waged war against the cartels , he was ridiculed and criticized by many @entity5 for stirring the hornet 's nest			1
south of the border , drug traffickers are familia			0
it will be interesting to see if any of that changes in light of the disappearance of the students			0
for @entity5 , their most treasured institution is still the family			1
those who threaten it do so at their peril			0
already , the case has claimed a political casualty			0
on friday , @entity206 , the governor of @entity207 , appeared to yield to public pressure over the disappearances , requesting a leave of absence			0
by the way , much of this is not meant for the public consumption of @entity214			0
when you talk to @entity5 's elites on both sides of the border — lawyers , politicians , businessmen — what you hear again and again is that @entity5 had a makeover			1
desperate for @entity214 investment dollars — now more than ever , given @entity5 's recent and historic efforts to open up the country 's lucrative petroleum industry to foreign investment — the elites aggressively push a narrative that @entity5 is safe , democratic and open for business			1
now , due to events in a small @entity5 town , that narrative is being challenged by reality			1
unfortunately , the new version of @entity5 bears a resemblance to the old one .			2
