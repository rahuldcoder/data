-- in the cold , predawn hours of february 20 , 2007 , shortly after 4 a.m. , armed men stormed into the home i owned with my family and burst into my bedroom , shouting at me to show my hands			1
my husband had left for work , and our 4 - year - old son began to cry with fright			0
i stumbled out of bed in my nightclothes to the family living area , terrified and confused			2
two armed men were coming upstairs from our basement , having searched it without permission , and others were demanding that we tell them the location of my ex-husband , with whom i had not lived for several years			0
as i had reported to the immigration service on my daughters ' citizenship applications , i had been remarried for four years			0
the men acted as if they had the right to be in our home , but we knew to ask questions : who were they ? did they have a warrant ? they refused to identify themselves or show a warrant , and they put their hands on their guns when we tried to move			0
they interrogated my 12 - year - old daughter and ordered my brother , a @entity41 citizen since he was a teenager , to produce his papers			0
that 's when i realized the men were @entity45 agents			0
when they left , they threatened to return			0
the same scene was happening all over @entity49 : armed agents surrounding homes , pounding on doors and windows , ordering residents to open the door and storming in , sometimes damaging doors and walls , sometimes pointing guns as they entered			2
it did n't seem to matter to the agents whether they found the person they were looking for or if frightened people in the home could not produce papers			1
the agents arrested people even if they had n't been a target			2
the @entity69 agents had no judicial warrants ; instead , they claimed that the rudely awakened men , women and sometimes children in the homes had provided consent			1
we decided to sue and discovered that @entity69 had embarked on a nationwide program of warrantless immigration sweeps with names such as " @entity80 " and " @entity81 " to invade private homes in search of undocumented immigrants			1
last week , more than six years and many court battles later , our class - action suit @entity69 , which included 22 @entity49 men , women and children , was settled in @entity90 for a million dollars			1
@entity69 has also been required to change national training and policy to conform with existing law to avoid further abuses from home raids			1
we are proud of this accomplishment , even though we know that home raid operations have continued in the @entity99 era , most notably in @entity100 and @entity101 , where @entity102 report @entity69 engaging in the very same unconstitutional behavior that traumatized my family			1
during those raids in 2006 and 2007 , thousands of terrified people , mostly @entity107 , were pulled out of bed			1
@entity69 claimed it was looking for people not suspected of a crime , but merely those in violation of civil immigration laws			1
although @entity69 was supposedly seeking fugitives -- people who may have evaded a deportation order -- most of the people they arrested had never had any encounter with the agency before			1
they were arrested because many @entity69 agents were operating under a quota policy that gave credit for arrests of any undocumented person , not just the target			1
citizens and lawful permanent residents like us were not immune ; if @entity69 had an old address for someone they were looking for , that address was fair game			2
in the home of three of the other people in our case , @entity69 knew it had already deported the person it were seeking			1
but agents invaded anyway , storming inside after a 12 - year - old girl opened the door in her pajamas			0
@entity69 invaded the home of another family in our case twice in little more than a year , because when agents did n't find their target the first time , they did n't bother to record the mistake			1
it seemed that being @entity107 , and nothing more , was enough to arouse suspicion			0
@entity69 declined to enter the homes of white residents who opened their doors in shock			2
latino men and women were handcuffed before they were even asked about their status , and some agents even admitted to using the derogatory word " wet " to describe the @entity102 they encountered			0
i studied the @entity161 in order to naturalize			0
i knew that the government is not supposed to enter your home without a warrant or handcuff you only because you are @entity107			2
but that night in 2007 , and in the months after , i lost a sense of hope in our government 's ability to make its own agents obey the law			0
the fact that @entity69 has agreed to some changes helps me regain that hope			0
as the country debates immigration reform and enforcement , we owe it to ourselves to hold @entity69 's leaders and agents accountable and to make sure that they are subject to the same laws as everyone else			2
the opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the writers .			0

class - action suit brought by @entity189 requires @entity69 to change policy on home raids
agents had stormed into @entity107 homes in *middle* of night , pulling people out of bed
@entity199 : @entity69 agents terrified families and did not have permission or warrants
@entity199 : @entity69 must be held to the same legal *standards* as everyone else to avoid abuses
