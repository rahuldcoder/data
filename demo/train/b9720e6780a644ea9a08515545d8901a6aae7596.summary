" i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the @entity6			1
" -- @entity9 president @entity8 speaking before a joint session of @entity11 on may 25 , 1961			2
it was the height of the @entity13 and the @entity9 and the @entity14 were battling it out to be the first nation to put a man on the lunar surface			2
on july 20 , 1969 , eight years after president @entity8 implored the @entity9 congress for funding for space exploration , @entity20 's @entity19 spaceflight touched down on the moon			1
@entity9 astronauts @entity27 and @entity28 became the first humans in history to walk on the @entity6 's nearest neighbor			1
since then a further 10 men have left their footprints on the moon 's dusty surface , with the last being @entity37 astronaut @entity36 in 1972			1
but after this golden age , moon exploration was seen as not cost effective for international space agencies			1
then , last year , @entity41 sent its @entity43 explorer on a three - month mission to examine the moon 's crust			1
but it suffered a critical malfunction just half way through and bid farewell to humanity in a final report ( although it is still functioning , according to @entity41 press reports )			2
now @entity54 is shooting for the stars and calling for private organizations to participate in an international competition for innovators to go back to the moon			1
the @entity60 hopes to spur exploration on the moon and will see a hefty $ 20 million jackpot handed to the first team that puts a robot on the lunar surface			1
but that 's not all -- there are a few scientific objectives a team must complete in order to obtain the ultimate honors from @entity54			1
once on the moon , the robot must travel 500 meters and transmit hd video back to @entity6			1
and they 've got to do it all by december 31 , 2015			2
read more : do we need to go back to the moon ? inspiring innovators " competition leads to innovation , and the @entity60 has brought together some of the brightest and most talented minds to accelerate the private @entity86 sector , " says @entity81 , senior director of the @entity60			1
" we are encouraged to see this prize pushing the industry to take risks and invest in cutting - edge technologies to support lunar exploration , which will result in an entirely new economy around low - cost access to the moon and beyond			1
" it is now seven years after the prize was launched and 18 private teams remain in the running			1
working tirelessly to secure funding ( only 10 % of financing can come from government sources ) as well as designing and building their individual modules , these international innovators are finally moving into the testing phase			2
@entity9 - based company @entity105 was set up off the back of the competition 's announcement , said @entity109 , the company 's ceo			1
" the @entity60 is a catalyst to get started but it is not the end game			2
what we 're doing as a company is creating a long - term sustainable business of carrying payloads to the moon so it 's like @entity121 or a @entity123 truck that flies regularly to the moon			1
" in partnership with students from @entity127 , in @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity105 is building a lander and a rover as part of its @entity134 mission to travel to the rather dramatically named @entity135 -- meaning " @entity136			1
" the team hopes to explore a pit that it suspects could be linked to a larger cave network underneath the moon 's surface			1
journeying to the ' @entity136 ' " we think that the right way to settle the moon is underground first			1
you go underground , you pop up an inflatable or a small habitat under there and you have natural protection from the elements			0
you 're protected from micrometeorites that come in and the moon does n't have an atmosphere to burn them up			1
you 're protected from radiation , " says @entity109			0
" it 's much easier to sustain long - term life on the surface of the moon so it 's really a game - changer in the catalyst of the future of the moon			1
that 's why we go there for the first mission : to explore , to see what these [ pits ] are about , and to cast the vision for the future			0
" the @entity105 team will be going down to the wire as it works towards a tentative launch date at the end of 2015 -- right before the competition deadline			1
and it wo n't be the only team holding its breath			0
as part of its funding strategy , @entity105 has offered to bring up several other prize contenders , essentially creating a secondary moon race within the competition			1
@entity109 explains : " we 'll have other rovers that will deploy from our lander and those rovers will drive out and try to win the @entity60			0
it will be very much like @entity190 happening live on the moon now and the world will be able to watch , which will be incredibly exciting			1
" what you do n't want is a provider like us being incentivized to place first and everyone else to come in last			0
that 's not a good scenario for a partnership so the way we 've modeled it is in a way that the partners can win and it helps everyone			0
it 's really like a ' coop - petition , ' " he adds			0
despite millions of dollars at stake , the @entity134 mission comes before the competition , says @entity109			2
" the mission is more important for us			0
the @entity60 teams will be a small portion of the total payload that flies ... when we land we 'll have payloads from all over the world landing and doing various missions , sub-missions and objectives			2
" a moon bunny ? another team hoping to reach the lunar surface is @entity225 , which is building a hopper to bounce across the rocky terrain			2
" when you are on the moon you have one - sixth gravity and there 's no air resistance so we kind of use those to our advantage			2
and since we already have a spacecraft already designed to autonomously land , it 's pretty trivial for it to repeat that and just hop , " says the company 's public outreach liaison @entity235			0
competitions like this offer the opportunity to get closer to untapped resources as well as inspire future generations , adds @entity235			0
" it is recreating what we call the ' @entity252 effect , ' " he says			0
" during the @entity252 , we inspired a generation of children who grew up to build their own industries and companies and now these billionaires are reinvesting and building things , investing in space companies			0
" you have @entity261 from @entity262 , you have @entity263 -- all these people that are called ' @entity266 ' -- people who grew up thinking they would go to college in space and then once they got there , realizing that the space program kind of left them behind and so now they are using their own resources to reinvest in that and make the dreams they had when they were younger a reality			0
" ' it 's not about scientific discovery ' for space scientist @entity279 , this competition is more about technological payoff than scientific discovery			2
" these missions are always about process , " she says			0
" so the first mission is about technology -- can we get there ? can we build something that is robust enough to survive in the extreme environment of space ? and then the science comes later			0
so i think first of all , this is very much about a technology development			0
" @entity295 , who is a @entity296 based at the @entity297 at the @entity298 , uses @entity299 as an analogy to reveal why it is n't necessarily a bad thing that little scientific research will come out of this particular endeavor			0
" the first technology to land on the surface of @entity299 was primitive really			0
it was all about getting to the @entity299 surface and surviving and here we are several decades after the @entity310 landed and we 're still looking for life , we 're still looking at challenging questions			0
you go , you learn , you feedback			0
you develop new instrumentation that 's more capable , that can record more data , can transmit more data , and can be more sophisticated each time			2
" she adds : " so for me , this is -- i do n't want to say primitive because its not primitive -- but it 's not going to be the science be all and end all			0
this is the start of the process			0
" see : capturing the @entity326 through a lens explore : take a look under @entity330 's hood			0

@entity54 competition asks teams to send a module to the moon
once on moon , robot must travel 500m , transmit video back to @entity6
18 private teams are still in the running
