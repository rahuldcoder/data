-- the @entity1 issued a fresh burst of ominous rhetoric thursday , warning that @entity5 bases in @entity6 and @entity7 are within its " striking range			0
" the statement from the @entity10 of the @entity1 , carried by the @entity12 's state - run news agency , follows the announcement by the @entity5 this week that its b - 52 bombers were making flights over @entity16 as part of annual military exercises			1
" the @entity5 should not forget that the @entity21 on @entity6 where the b - 52s take off and naval bases in @entity7 proper and @entity25 where nuclear - powered submarines are launched are within the striking range of the @entity20 's precision strike means , " the @entity20 military said thursday			1
despite @entity32 's rhetoric , no @entity30 submarines are based in @entity25 or anywhere else in @entity7 , although they may make calls at @entity5 bases there			2
@entity20 is short for @entity20 , @entity20 's official name			0
interactive : nuclear weapons : who has what ? citing what it called the @entity5 ' " nuclear blackmail and threat , " the @entity12 said it that it , too , would " take corresponding military actions			1
" @entity32 had already reacted angrily to the @entity46 flights , warning wednesday of " strong military counteraction " if the planes made more sorties over the @entity50			2
angry words after new sanctions tensions have spiked in the region since @entity20 carried out its latest underground nuclear test last month , the first under its new young leader @entity57 , prompting the @entity59 @entity58 to respond by toughening sanctions on the secretive regime			1
the sanctions enraged the @entity12 further , and during the week when the @entity58 was voting on them , it ratcheted up its threats , suggesting it could carry out a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the @entity5 and @entity16			1
although analysts and @entity5 officials say @entity32 is still a long way from being able to carry out such an attack on the @entity5 mainland , the @entity5 ' bases in @entity7 and @entity6 appear to be within range of the @entity12 's conventional weapons			1
in its comments thursday , " the @entity57 regime is just firing back " at its enemies in response to the @entity46 flights and the military exercises of which they 're a part , said @entity74 , a professor of international relations at @entity76 in @entity77			1
he said that the @entity59 sanctions were also likely to be fueling the @entity12 's ire , but that the regime 's threats were largely driven by domestic concerns			2
" they 're doing all this to prop up the regime , " @entity74 said			0
the military first strategy since @entity57 took over from his father as the head of the @entity20 government in late 2011 , he appears to have maintained the pursuit of a stronger military deterrent rather than adopting a more conciliatory approach to relations with @entity16 and the @entity5			1
the result has been a major foreign policy headache for @entity5 president @entity103 , with @entity57 showing more interest in dialogue with the basketball star @entity106 than @entity5 diplomats			0
as well as the nuclear test , his government has conducted two long - range rocket launches -- one that failed and one that succeeded -- both of which were widely viewed as tests of ballistic missile technology			2
@entity57 has also revamped the military 's leadership , ousting some generals and promoting others			0
the nuclear test and rocket launches have shattered hopes of any new talks on the @entity12 's nuclear program in the near future			1
indeed , @entity32 has said recently that the program is not up for negotiation and announced that previous nonaggression treaties with @entity77 no longer apply			0
a new @entity20 the regime 's unabashed declarations about its nuclear weapons , which it had been much cagier about in the past , show that " it 's not the same @entity20 as 10 years ago , " @entity74 said			2
the @entity5 and other global powers need to " formulate a whole new strategy " to address the changed situation , according to @entity74			0
" the way we 've been dealing with it for the past two decades has failed , " he said of the regime			0
" it has become close to being able to deploy nuclear weapons			0
" although @entity5 officials say they do n't believe @entity20 is in a position to strike the @entity5 at the moment , defense secretary @entity142 last week announced plans to deploy additional ground - based missile interceptors on the @entity149 as part of efforts to enhance the nation 's ability to defend itself from attack			1
" the reason that we are doing what we are doing , and the reason we are advancing our program here for homeland security , is to not take any chances , is to stay ahead of the threat and to assure any contingency , " @entity155 said at the time .			0
