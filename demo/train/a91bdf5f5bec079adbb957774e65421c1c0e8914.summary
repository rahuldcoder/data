the fortunes of potential @entity2 allies among @entity4 rebel groups are ebbing fast as hardline @entity6 groups and especially @entity8 's affiliate go on the offensive			1
the past month has dealt further reverses to already - beleaguered moderate groups , whose presence in the critical northern provinces of @entity15 and @entity16 has further eroded			0
this is a growing headache for the @entity19 administration , which is trying to identify , train and " stand up " moderate rebel factions to take on the @entity21 in @entity22 and @entity4			2
@entity23 has announced a $ 500 million program to train 5,000 fighters over one year			0
but it is yet to begin , and some of these groups are now in retreat or on the verge of extinction			0
those that are n't are wary of being identified as " @entity23 's guys " because of the administration 's focus on degrading isis but not going after @entity4 government forces			1
tough road for moderate groups analysts say moderate groups are caught between a rock and a hard place , pilloried by radical factions for taking @entity44 weapons but failing to get enough of them ( or quickly enough ) to become serious players			0
@entity48 of the @entity49 writes in @entity50 , " for a rebel commander seeking to convince his fighters that cooperation with @entity23 is in the rebellion 's best interest , @entity2 strikes that ignore the @entity58 regime while hitting ( @entity60 rebels in ) @entity61 are extremely difficult to explain			1
" moderate groups also suffer from poor morale and a lack of resources			1
all in all , says @entity66 , president of the @entity67 , " the forces that the @entity2 has nominally been backing have suffered losses at the hands of the @entity21 , @entity71 ( @entity8 's @entity4 franchise ) and the regime			1
" the current trajectory , she says , means " the moderate opposition remains marginal and incapable of shaping the battlefield in any material way			0
" @entity48 said coalition airstrikes against @entity36 had allowed president @entity58 to refocus on hitting mainstream rebels , and the regime had made gains around @entity82 and @entity16			1
combined with @entity71 's advances in @entity15 and the threat of a renewed offensive by @entity36 , moderate groups were now in danger of a rapid decline			1
@entity88 , founder of the website @entity90 , agrees : " @entity2 policy freed up the regime to step up bombings of its own civilians , which we are seeing in areas across @entity4 such as @entity97 , @entity82 and @entity98			2
" @entity71 appears to have benefited from the limited strikes against its subsidiary , the @entity100 , which the @entity2 alleges is planning attacks on the @entity103			1
observers say the strikes , and reports of civilian casualties , have gained the group sympathy and support			0
making things still worse , there appears to be at least a truce between @entity71 and @entity36 , allowing each to focus on other enemies , whether moderate groups , the regime or the @entity116 , and consolidate control over their respective strongholds			1
the @entity2 director of national intelligence , @entity119 , last month spoke of " tactical accommodations " between the two groups			0
other sources say smaller @entity6 groups that share the jihadist outlook of @entity71 and @entity36 have helped broker local agreements			1
an @entity71 spokesman , @entity126 , told @entity90 last month that @entity71 is looking for a cease - fire , though not a larger merger with @entity36 , because it wants to focus on fighting " just the @entity129 ( regime )			1
" such a truce may allow @entity71 free rein in the northwest of @entity4 , while @entity36 focuses on its heartland in the northeast			1
in the past month , it has overwhelmed forces of the @entity137 and @entity138 in @entity15 , both supported by the @entity2 and @entity140			0
the @entity137 had been seen as a potential @entity2 ally since it helped expel @entity36 fighters from the region in january			2
dozens of @entity146 fighters defected to @entity71 , according to local activists			2
@entity71 fighters are within a few kilometers of border crossings into @entity150 , a source of revenue and resupply			2
local activists and analysts also see @entity71 developing a closer relationship with the most powerful group within the @entity158 : @entity61			2
@entity88 says @entity159 is popular in @entity15 as many of its members are from the province			0
" they have the popularity ; @entity167 has more of the military might , " she says			0
together , " they appear to be a formidable foe for anyone looking to take over @entity15			0
" @entity71 's propaganda machine has showcased the social services it is providing and its convoys parading through @entity15			1
to some analysts , @entity71 appears to be emulating @entity36 in building its own emirate in northern @entity4			1
in a recording leaked in july , @entity71 's leader , @entity177 , was heard saying the time had come to establish " an @entity158 emirate in the @entity181			1
" @entity48 says it has " withdrawn assets from key fronts with the regime and shifted them to establish unilateral control of other areas			0
" @entity71 has begun implementing sharia law and building local government , releasing images of its @entity191 ( @entity158 preaching ) offices in the town of @entity194 and elsewhere			2
but @entity88 says " they are moving slowly , because people still fear @entity167 is a version of @entity36			2
@entity167 is launching campaigns to create gardens , pick up trash and other measures that improve people 's quality of life			0
" even so , other factions are apprehensive that it 's on the way to emulating @entity36 and building its own caliphate , says @entity48			1
@entity208 choice in neighboring @entity16 province , an area the @entity58 regime has fought hard to control , the battlefield is even more complex			1
after @entity215 , the city of @entity16 remains the most important theater for both the regime and its opponents			0
@entity44 reporters who have managed to get into @entity16 say the @entity158 -- an umbrella group of @entity60 militia -- is in control of rebel - held neighborhoods , while @entity71 dominates in the countryside to the north			2
@entity71 and its allies are engaged in a bitter battle against the regime and fighters of the @entity231 militia @entity230 for control of two nearby towns -- @entity234 and @entity235 -- inhabited largely by pro-regime @entity236			2
videos and photographs uploaded in recent days suggest a sustained assault against @entity234 and @entity240 : in one instance , @entity71 appears to have used a captured armored troop carrier as a massive suicide bomb			1
success against the regime in these towns would secure a vital supply route for rebels clinging on in @entity16 in the face of aerial and artillery bombardment , but for now , the towns ' defenders are holding out			0
@entity71 is clearly taking territory while it can , perhaps wary of @entity36 suddenly turning on it ( as it did in august ) or the emergence of better - equipped groups supported by the @entity103			1
as the regime and rebels fight to a standstill around @entity16 , @entity36 waits in the wings , looking for an opportunity to take further territory ( if not the city itself ) from exhausted combatants			2
@entity36 holds rural areas near the town of @entity267 , 20 miles north of @entity16			0
among the groups lined up against it are fighters of the @entity270 , a mainstream outfit that has @entity2 support and claims to have about 6,000 fighters			0
but one of the group 's commanders , @entity276 , told @entity277 this week that only 50 men have received training in a @entity281 - sponsored program			0
they would be hard - pressed to resist a renewed @entity36 assault in the area			0
ultimately , @entity48 says , " to reverse jihadist gains , you need to strengthen moderate groups and get as many of them as possible on the same page			0
" the creation last week of the @entity290 , which includes a wide spectrum of rebel groups , could be significant -- if it survives and so long as it does n't become just a vehicle for @entity6 factions such as @entity61			1
so far , says @entity48 , " the bottom line is that the pace and scale of @entity2 support is not sufficient to halt , let alone reverse , the erosion of moderate forces			0
" most territory in @entity4 is essentially shared by the " big three " : @entity36 , @entity71 and its allies , and the regime			1
" the @entity2 have painted themselves into a corner , left to work only with so - called moderates , who at this point have mostly been kidnapped , killed , exiled or absorbed into @entity60 factions , " says @entity88			0
that fits the @entity58 regime 's game plan			2
kill off the mainstream groups and leave the @entity103 with a stark choice : @entity58 or @entity36 and other jihadist groups turning @entity4 into an @entity158 state			1
@entity317 , scenes of devastation everywhere			0

hardline @entity6 groups and especially @entity8 's affiliate on offensive in @entity4
moderates suffer from poor morale , lack of resources , allowing others to *prosper*
making things still worse , there appears to be at least truce between @entity71 and @entity36
@entity103 has stark choice : @entity58 or @entity36 and other jihadist groups
