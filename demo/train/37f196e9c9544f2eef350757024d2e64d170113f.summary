-- it did n't take a rocket scientist to predict that @entity4 's plan to pay @entity5 to launch @entity7 astronauts into orbit was n't going to turn out well			0
three years after @entity4 retired the space shuttle program , relations between the @entity7 and @entity5 are worse than at any point since the end of the @entity13			0
@entity7 have reportedly been paying @entity5 $ 70 million a seat to send our astronauts to the @entity17			0
that 's three and a half times what the @entity5 charge private space tourists for the same ride on their 1960s - era spacecraft			0
now @entity5 president @entity24 is reconstituting the @entity5 empire , and senior @entity5 officials have reacted to our economic sanctions by suggesting that @entity7 " bring their astronauts to the @entity17 using a trampoline			0
" @entity4 and our elected officials are to blame for this embarrassment			0
@entity4 has tried to replace the shuttle on its own before resorting to the commercial industry -- programs that were canceled after ludicrous cost overruns and technical setbacks			2
and worse , politicians and bureaucratic backscratchers repeatedly undermined the nascent commercial space industry , where new @entity7 companies are working to do less expensively what @entity4 was failing to do itself : develop a spacecraft capable of carrying humans into orbit			1
instead of accelerating the creation of a thriving commercial space industry , @entity4 's second choice -- after its own program failed -- was to pay the @entity5 government rather than @entity7 companies for tickets into orbit			1
but now that @entity4 's funding of the @entity5 space program has become unattractive politically , its 4 - year - old program to hire @entity7 companies to send crew to the @entity17 takes on new importance			0
on tuesday , @entity4 announced the winners of its " commercial crew " competition			2
which of the entrants did the agency award for the biggest contract ? was it @entity68 , a new leader in commercial spaceflight , which has gone from startup to multibillion dollar company in just over a decade , spent hundreds of millions of private investment designing and building three new rockets and a human - rated space capsule , completed more than a dozen launches and lined up dozens more for commercial customers , and proved itself more cost effective than its larger competition ? was it @entity81 , another private company that has developed a small , winged space plane that lands passengers returning to @entity85 comfortably on runways , rather than sending them hurdling into the ocean -- giving the design a unique commercial potential ? no. the largest contract in a program designed to boost competition within the commercial space industry went to @entity94 -- the gigantic , heavily subsidized government contractor with a history of huge cost overruns			1
although @entity68 did win a smaller prize of its own , the fact that the old incumbent is getting a contract to provide services to the space station is going to limit the promise of @entity7 's commercial space industry			1
but worse , despite committing to purchase some of these services from @entity94 and @entity68 , @entity4 is still reportedly at work on its own , vastly more expensive design , the @entity107 , in which @entity94 is also involved			1
to anyone who is n't a @entity4 employee , a @entity4 contractor or a @entity7 senator with a protected workforce in his state , this makes no sense			0
@entity4 should not be developing its own proprietary version of capabilities it could purchase commercially at much lower cost , especially when we know the agency 's bureaucratic tendencies will be to view the commercial versions as competitors to kill			0
instead , @entity126 should kill the @entity4 version and require the agency to purchase basic launch services from companies such as @entity68 , @entity81 , and even @entity94 -- if it can make its designs cost - competitive			2
commercial space advocates in @entity126 have been trying to do this for years , but bureaucracies -- both government agencies and their giant contractors -- are extraordinarily adept at protecting themselves and their interests			2
in addition , @entity126 should hold hearings on why @entity4 selected such an expensive proposal for its commercial crew program when potentially cheaper , more innovative designs were available			1
tuesday 's announcement was a modest step forward for the commercial space industry , since it will mark the first time @entity4 has bought tickets from @entity7 companies to send astronauts into space			1
but @entity4 will need to embrace new entrants and promote a lot more competition to make sure this one small step for @entity4 is n't one giant leap backward on the taxpayer dime .			1

@entity4 missed a chance to back cheaper , more innovative design in new contract , @entity158 says
*decision* to award @entity68 a contract was a modest step forward for the commercial space industry , he says
but @entity4 will need to embrace new entrants and promote a lot more competition , he adds
