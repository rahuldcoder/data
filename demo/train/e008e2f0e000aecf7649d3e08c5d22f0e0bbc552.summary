-- @entity2 foreign minister @entity1 insisted wednesday that the @entity4 administration mischaracterizes concessions by his side in the six - month nuclear deal with @entity2 , telling @entity0 in an exclusive interview that " we did not agree to dismantle anything			1
" @entity1 told @entity0 chief national security correspondent @entity11 that terminology used by the @entity13 to describe the agreement differed from the text agreed to by @entity2 and the other countries in the talks -- the @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
" the @entity13 version both underplays the concessions and overplays @entity2 commitments " under the agreement that took effect monday , @entity1 said in @entity24 , @entity25 , where he was attending the @entity26			1
as part of the accord , @entity2 was required to dilute its stockpile of uranium that had been enriched to 20 % , well above the 5 % level needed for power generation but still below the level for developing a nuclear weapon			1
in addition , the deal mandated that @entity2 halt all enrichment above 5 % and " dismantle the technical connections required to enrich above 5 % , " according to a @entity13 fact sheet issued in november after the initial agreement was reached			1
@entity1 accused the @entity4 administration of creating a false impression with such language			2
" the @entity13 tries to portray it as basically a dismantling of @entity2 's nuclear program			1
that is the word they use time and again , " he said , urging @entity11 to read the actual text of the agreement			0
" if you find a single , a single word , that even closely resembles dismantling or could be defined as dismantling in the entire text , then i would take back my comment			0
" he repeated that " we are not dismantling any centrifuges , we 're not dismantling any equipment , we 're simply not producing , not enriching over 5 %			0
" " you do n't need to over-emphasize it , " @entity1 said of the @entity13 language			1
a separate summary sent out by the @entity13 last week did not use the word dismantle			2
in an interview with @entity0 's @entity72 on wednesday , @entity2 president @entity70 echoed @entity1 's statement , saying the government will not destroy existing centrifuges			1
however , he added : " we are ready to provide confidence that there should be no concern about @entity2 's program			1
" responding to @entity1 's comments to @entity0 , a senior administration official said " we expected that the @entity2 would need to spin this for their domestic political purposes , and are not surprised they are doing just that			1
" @entity2 and @entity18 officials have tried to sell the nuclear agreement to domestic opponents in their respective countries who could scuttle it			1
@entity2 officials have called the interim pact a victory and said it failed to halt the nation 's nuclear development program , while @entity18 officials say the agreement essentially froze @entity2 's nuclear program and rolled back some capabilities			1
@entity1 noted the political pressure facing both sides , which includes a push in @entity103 for more sanctions against @entity2 that @entity105 warns would destroy any chance for success in talks on a long - range nuclear agreement intended to prevent development of an @entity2 nuclear weapon			1
" all of us are facing difficulties and oppositions and concerns and misgivings , " he said , noting he had been summoned wednesday to @entity2 's parliament to answer questions			2
asked about his relationship with secretary of state @entity120 , @entity1 called it " very difficult because we 're both going into these negotiations with a lot of baggage			0
" progress has been made , he said , but " it 's yet too early to talk about trust			0
" @entity1 and @entity70 traveled to @entity25 for annual gathering of world political and business leaders in @entity24 as a new round of @entity132 talks started in @entity133 before moving to @entity134			0
@entity2 , a major backer of @entity132 president @entity136 , was invited to the @entity132 talks by @entity138 secretary general ban ki - moon , then disinvited under pressure from the @entity18 because @entity105 refused to endorse conditions in a previous agreement setting up the talks			2
" we do not like the way @entity2 was treated , " he said , adding " it did not enhance the credibility of the @entity138 or the office of the secretary general			0
" @entity1 expressed hope that the @entity132 talks could succeed , but he criticized @entity132 opposition groups and their supporters that opposed @entity2 's participation in the talks for what he called spreading extremism and trying to impose their will on the @entity132 people			1
he explained @entity2 's support for the @entity132 government , a longtime ally , by saying " @entity2 finds itself in a situation where we see the very prominent and serious danger of terrorism , extremism , sectarian tension being fed from outside and creating a very dangerous environment in @entity132			0
" to @entity1 , an agreement among @entity132 that brings a democratically elected government is the only solution , and he dismissed concerns that a free and fair vote would be impossible with @entity136 in power and running as a candidate			2
@entity120 said earlier wednesday in @entity133 that there was " no way " @entity136 will be part of a transitional government sought by the @entity134 talks			0
" why do n't we talk about it ? " @entity1 asked			2
" and why do n't we allow the @entity132 to talk about how they can conduct a free and fair election ? why do people need to set an agenda and impose their agenda on the @entity132 people ? " @entity11 also asked @entity1 about his visit last week to lay a wreath at the grave of @entity192 leader @entity191 in @entity193			2
the @entity18 condemned the gesture , saying @entity191 was " responsible for heinous acts of terrorism that killed hundreds of innocent people , including @entity18 , " said a statement by @entity200 spokesperson @entity199			0
@entity1 responded that his visit should be seen in the same context as the @entity18 delegation that attended the recent funeral of @entity204 , the former @entity205 leader who was defense minister when mass killings occurred at refugee camps under his command in 1982			2
" it 's a decision based on national perceptions and national beliefs , " he said , describing @entity191 as a revered figure for resisting @entity205 occupation while calling @entity211 responsible for the massacre of @entity213 and @entity193 in the @entity215 camps			0
" i believe @entity219 and @entity220 were crimes against humanity , " @entity1 said			0
democracy : @entity225 's beautiful dream in the wrong hands opinion : will global elite listen to @entity228 of poor ? can @entity24 make a difference to global inequality ? opinion : @entity233 's leaders have failed the @entity234 @entity0 chief national security correspondent @entity11 reported this story from @entity24 , @entity25			0
