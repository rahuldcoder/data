-- solid support from registered democrats and women in @entity4 were crucial tuesday as sen. @entity5 rebounded from her third - place finish in last week 's @entity8 caucuses			1
sen. @entity5 has spent the past few days saying she has the experience to change @entity10			1
she narrowly defeated sen. @entity11 in the @entity4 primary , with 39 percent of the vote to @entity11 's 37			1
" last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , " the @entity15 senator said after her victory			0
" now let 's give @entity21 the kind of comeback that @entity4 has just given me			0
" forty - three percent of self - styled independents said they voted for @entity11 , and 31 percent said they backed @entity25			1
independents made up 43 percent of all voters polled			2
addressing his roaring supporters after the race was called , @entity11 congratulated @entity25			1
but he was a candidate determined to draw a distinction between @entity25 and himself			0
" but the reason our campaign has always been different , the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago , is because it 's not just about what i will do as president , " he said			0
" it is also about what you , the people who love this country , the citizens of the @entity21 , can do to change it			0
that 's what this election is all about			0
" but @entity25 was ahead of @entity11 45 percent to 34 percent among those who said they were registered @entity2			1
those voters made up a majority -- 54 percent -- of all respondents			2
@entity25 also claimed the majority of women 's votes , according to the polling			0
that 's in contrast to last week 's @entity8 caucuses , in which @entity11 surprised observers by stealing the female vote from @entity25			1
analysts say that shift among female voters was crucial to the @entity25 turnaround			2
" if i had a single word , the word would be ' women , ' " said @entity0 political analyst @entity67			1
" she got the women back			0
" and @entity67 said the support of union voters that put @entity25 over the top			0
" @entity78 voters have her a 10 point lead , " he said			0
@entity0 projected former sen. @entity81 to finish third			1
college graduates , who made up 29 percent of the electorate , opted narrowly for @entity25 -- 38 percent to @entity11 's 37 percent , according to the polling			1
those polled who called themselves very liberal , and moderate , went with @entity25 over @entity11 -- although by less than 2 percentage points in each -- and those who said they are somewhat liberal were evenly split			1
pundits also were citing the role of former president @entity25 in helping his wife recover from what pre-primary polls were suggesting was a deficit of 9 percentage points to @entity11 in @entity4			1
the former president spent tuesday in @entity94 -- home to @entity96 -- where @entity11 had been expected to win handily			1
" they dispatched him to the area that @entity11 was surging , " said @entity0 analyst @entity97 , who managed former vice president @entity99 's campaign in 2000			1
" i think it had the effect of tamping down @entity11 support and giving senator @entity25 a real reason to come back in this race			2
" @entity4 was considered crucial to @entity25 's campaign			0
if @entity11 had been able to sweep @entity8 and @entity4 -- after months of @entity25 being considered the front - runner among @entity2 -- it could have given him powerful momentum going into future primaries			2
" age is also playing a big factor -- older voters are overwhelmingly outnumbering younger voters -- a proportion that is clearly benefiting @entity25 , " @entity67 said			1
" sixty - seven percent of @entity2 primary voters are over the age of 40 , and they are breaking heavily for @entity25 over @entity11			1
" over the past several days , @entity25 has trumpeted her experience , saying that she has delivered change as both first lady and as a senator			0
after losing to @entity11 in last week 's @entity8 caucuses , it was unclear whether she could overcome what appeared to be @entity11 's ability to electrify @entity21 voters who had previously taken a sour and skeptical view of politicians and the political process			1
the duel between the @entity11 and @entity25 campaigns grew especially testy monday and tuesday			2
she said she had more experience than he , and was therefore more qualified			0
he accused her of representing the status quo of @entity10			0
and on the eve of the @entity4 primary , @entity25 criticized the media for not pressing @entity11 more fully on @entity141 , and accused the @entity143 senator of shifting his position to reflect changing attitudes about the war in @entity141			2
then , there was an issue unto itself -- @entity5 's almost - tears			2
@entity25 's eyes welled up this week while responding to a voter 's question about her health and appearance			0
pundits and voters alike questioned whether @entity25 's emotions were sincere or faked as part of some strategy to diminish criticism that she is too steely , too cold			0
in front of the crowd of mostly female @entity4 voters , an admittedly fatigued @entity25 responded to a question by saying : " this is very personal for me , it 's not just political , it 's [ that ] i see what 's happening , we have to reverse it			0
" her voice broke , and she was then applauded by the crowd			0
polls indicated the show of emotions fared well with male voters , according to @entity0 's @entity178 , but turned off some female voters			1
@entity81 was followed in votes by @entity182 gov. @entity181 and @entity184 rep. @entity183			2

sen. @entity11 has electrified younger voters
sen. @entity5 has maintained favor with voters older than 40
@entity0 has projected sen. @entity81 will finish in third place
