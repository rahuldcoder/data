@entity0 -- it must have been at least a little satisfying thursday for president @entity3			0
he had repeatedly warned @entity5 president @entity4 against annexing @entity6 from @entity7 , threatening tougher sanctions aimed at the @entity5 economy			0
following the @entity5 parliament 's vote to approve the annexation , @entity3 made a previously unscheduled appearance before tv cameras to essentially tell @entity4 : i told you i 'd do it			2
" these are all choices that the @entity5 government has made , choices that have been rejected by the international community , as well as the government of @entity7 , " @entity3 said			2
" and because of these choices , the @entity23 is today moving , as we said we would , to impose additional costs on @entity5			2
" ' we said we would ' his hastily arranged remarks signaled @entity29 allies that @entity3 would take a leading role on the issue , and also responded to pressure from political foes and some supporters at home for a tougher response to what vice president @entity36 called a " land grab " by @entity4			0
even @entity39 , @entity3 's former secretary of state who is the overwhelming favorite for the @entity42 presidential nomination in 2016 , said this week that the administration should do more to support @entity7			0
@entity5 lawmakers vote to annex @entity6 ; @entity23 steps up sanctions the steps announced thursday expanded on a previous @entity23 list of sanctions targets , adding more senior @entity5 officials and what officials called " cronies " of @entity4 as well as a bank controlled by a @entity4 associate			1
@entity3 also warned @entity55 that possible further sanctions would go after key sectors of the economy if @entity5 escalates the crisis in @entity7			2
a new executive order signed by @entity3 authorizes his administration to target @entity5 companies in the financial services , energy , metals and mining , defense and engineering industries -- all vital components of the @entity5 economy			1
@entity72 leaders met thursday to discuss their own steps , so @entity3 's immediate response gave him the mantle of leadership on the matter			1
@entity79 's minister for european affairs and @entity80 told @entity1 's @entity81 that the @entity72 will add as many as 10 more names to its previous list of targets , but wo n't hit any companies at this stage			1
so far , @entity29 powers such as @entity88 and @entity89 have been unwilling to embrace significant economic sanctions against @entity5 because of their strong trade and investment ties with @entity55			0
severe consequences in a briefing to reporters , senior @entity23 administration officials sounded further warnings against any @entity5 provocations in @entity7			1
" we believe that it is very important to signal that if @entity5 further escalates this situation they will be met with severe consequences , " one official said			1
the tough talk looked even more credible compared to @entity5 's almost comical response to the @entity23 announcement : sanctions against nine @entity23 political leaders and administration officials			2
on @entity7 , more must be done @entity55 's list included house speaker @entity109 , senate majority leader @entity110 , @entity112 sens. @entity111 and @entity113 , @entity42 sens. @entity114 and @entity115 , and some members of @entity3 's @entity118 team			0
" i guess this means my spring break in @entity122 is off , my @entity124 stock is lost , and my secret bank account in @entity55 is frozen , " @entity111 joked in response			0
' badge of honor ' @entity115 , who is facing a tough re-election battle this year in generally conservative @entity128 , called her sanction by @entity5 " a badge of honor			1
" @entity3 and @entity23 officials have made clear that the response to @entity5 will remain in the diplomatic and economic arenas , with one senior administration official essentially rejecting for now any direct @entity23 effort to bolster @entity7 's military forces for a ground war			1
" nobody wants the outcome here to be a full - bore military conflict between @entity5 and @entity7 , and in fact , the @entity7 government themselves have been quite restrained in not giving in to provocation and not having this go the way of bloodshed , " the official said , adding that " we do n't want to take steps to add to a momentum of further militarizing the situation			0
" @entity154 walks a ' fine line ' on @entity4 @entity157 's @entity156 and @entity1 's @entity158 and @entity159 contributed to this report .			0
