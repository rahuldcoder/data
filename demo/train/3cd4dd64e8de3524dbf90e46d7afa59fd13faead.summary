@entity1 's neighbors are preparing for the worst as the specter of potential @entity4 airstrikes hang heavily over a nervous @entity5			1
as @entity8 president @entity7 makes his case to @entity10 and the international community for a military response to an alleged chemical attack by @entity1 regime forces in a @entity16 suburb , @entity6 explores how the countries bordering war - torn @entity1 feel about @entity1 president @entity19 and the possibility of foreign intervention in the bloody conflict there			1
@entity24 security is tightening and there is a mood of growing worry and angst in the streets of @entity31 , where many are convinced that strikes on @entity16 , less than 70 miles from the @entity33 capital , will further destabilize the country that , aside from @entity1 , has suffered the most as a result of the war			1
@entity24 is inextricably linked to its larger neighbor , and sectarian divisions there mirror those in @entity1			1
but while politicians who support @entity19 say the proposed airstrikes are reminiscent of the lead - up to the war in @entity47 , those who oppose him are playing it safe for now			1
@entity49 , the @entity50 leader and a supporter of @entity19 , said accusations of chemical weapons use by regime forces in a @entity16 suburb were " a reminder of ( @entity8 's ) previous lies to invade @entity47			0
no one buys these lies any longer			0
" @entity33 mp @entity60 , a staunch ally of the @entity1 rebels who previously accused the @entity19 regime of killing his father in the early years of @entity24 's civil war in the 1970s , said strikes would not deal a fatal blow to the @entity1 regime : " the action will not be decisive , particularly in the absence of international consensus on strike or on the post-strike era			1
" @entity74 , an @entity75 member of the @entity33 parliament , said the ramifications of airstrikes would probably depend on the reaction of @entity80 , the @entity31 - based @entity81 militant group that has joined @entity1 's civil war on behalf of its patrons in @entity16 and @entity84			1
the government has mostly tried to stay out of the conflict , but that has n't stopped the bloodshed -- and those fleeing the fighting -- from spilling over @entity24 's borders			2
one in six people in @entity24 is now a @entity1 refugee , and tensions between @entity33 and @entity1 are rising			2
@entity80 was the target of deadly @entity31 bombings in recent weeks that killed dozens and left many in @entity24 believing that the country is now a proxy battlefield as @entity84 and @entity102 fight to control the outcome of @entity1 's civil war			1
but despite these deep divisions , many @entity33 are united in the belief that potential strikes are little more than a superficial show of power from an @entity8 president backed into a corner by his " red line " declaration about chemical weapons use in @entity1			2
@entity115 thousands of scared residents in cities across @entity115 made their way to gas - mask distribution centers amid fears that potential airstrikes on @entity1 could result in retaliatory chemical attacks			1
in 2011 , @entity115 president @entity123 insisted at a news conference that @entity19 " must go , " but the comments have been an exception for the @entity115 government			2
in may of 2013 , an @entity115 defense ministry official specifically denied that @entity115 had " done anything against @entity19 and his regime			2
" still , @entity115 has been accused three times this year of launching airstrikes inside @entity1			1
in january , a @entity8 official said @entity115 fighter jets bombed a @entity1 convoy suspected of moving weapons to @entity80			2
@entity115 's military has long said it would target any transfer of weapons to @entity80 or other terrorist groups as well as any effort to smuggle @entity1 weapons into @entity24 that could threaten @entity115			1
@entity142 in @entity148 , an hour 's drive from the @entity1 border and well within range of @entity1 missiles , there are fears that @entity142 's involvement in the civil war could lead to attacks on its own soil			1
@entity154 is one of the @entity156 's key allies in the region and was the first @entity159 leader to call for @entity19 to step down			0
the vast majority of the country 's citizens are @entity163 and sympathize with the plight of the @entity1 rebels trying to topple the country 's @entity167 regime			2
opinion : why strikes in @entity1 are a bad idea it is an open secret that @entity102 is using @entity142 to smuggle weapons into @entity1 for the rebels			1
@entity142 says it is doing all it can to prevent that and does not want to inflame the situation in @entity1			2
but despite the fact the world 's military leaders gathered last week in @entity142 to discuss @entity1 , the government insists it will not be a launchpad for a @entity4 strike on its neighbor			1
@entity187 spokesman @entity186 said : " our position regarding the @entity1 crisis is based on our concern for @entity142 's higher national interests and our unfailing policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of our neighbors			1
" " @entity142 renews its calls for a political solution in @entity1 and urges the international community to intensify efforts to reach such a solution			2
" @entity47 in @entity47 , where at least 30,000 @entity1 refugees fled over a five - day period in late august , the government has said in recent days that the country is on high alert in anticipation of a strike in @entity1			2
@entity47 is opposed to @entity4 military intervention in @entity1 and is deeply divided along sectarian lines			1
@entity47 's @entity81 - dominated government is wary that the @entity212 who 've been involved in fighting @entity19 's regime are targeting the government in @entity215			0
prime minister @entity216 called for unity in a statement : " what is happening in @entity1 threatens @entity47 and the region , and all @entity47 , especially politicians , should unite and reject sectarianism and place the national interest above all partisan interests in order to ward off the dangers and protect national unity and sovereignty			0
" @entity102 @entity102 , the region 's @entity163 powerhouse , is walking a very fine line on @entity1			1
while many observers believe the @entity102 tacitly approve of the strikes , the government has not come out publicly in support of @entity4 military intervention			1
@entity102 foreign minister prince @entity236 has called for the @entity237 to shoulder its responsibilities to the @entity1 people and said the @entity19 regime had lost sight of its @entity159 identity			1
a majority of @entity102 support the rebels and want @entity19 gone , but they 're also horrified about the plight of ordinary @entity1 and believe missile strikes could exacerbate their suffering			1
@entity248 , editor - in - chief of the @entity249 , told @entity6 : " people here are against any attack that will cause more bloodshed to the existing conflict in @entity1			0
they know what happened in @entity47 -- how many innocent people died in @entity47 , @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259 due to strikes			0
i hope and believe people are not excited at the prospect of hits on @entity1			0
" " i would not want to see any strike on @entity1 that will only add to the agony of the @entity1 people			0
arabs have had enough of collateral damage			0
" @entity269 in @entity269 , which remains embroiled in its own deadly crisis more than a month after the military deposed and detained president @entity272 , a number of political parties have stood against foreign intervention in @entity1			0
the @entity277 movement , which spearheaded the drive to remove @entity272 from office , ripped the @entity8 and called on the @entity269 government to act in the event of a @entity4 strike on @entity1			0
@entity277 spokesman @entity283 said : " the @entity8 is an imperial state that has destroyed @entity47 and aims to destroy @entity1 and intervene in @entity269 affairs			0
" @entity290 , another spokesman , " demanded the closure of the @entity287 " if there is any naval movement toward @entity1 , according to state - owned @entity269 news			0
@entity292 , @entity269 's minister of foreign affairs , said the only way forward in @entity1 is a political solution			0
@entity258 in @entity258 , a country living under the constant specter of @entity8 drone strikes targeting @entity300 militants , it is nearly impossible to find anyone who supports @entity4 bombs in @entity1 , despite mixed attitudes about the @entity19 regime			1
@entity305 of @entity258 's @entity306 told @entity6 that foreign intervention in @entity1 will only increase @entity258 and @entity159 resentment of the @entity8 he said : " arabs do not trust the @entity8 anymore because it is attacking numerous @entity159 countries -- but some @entity159 leaders are working against their people 's will			0
" while many @entity258 would like to see @entity19 deposed , others are worried about the @entity163 extremist groups that could replace him if he went			0
@entity300 in the @entity315 vastly expanded its base in @entity258 after the fall of president @entity318 during the @entity319 in 2011			0
and while @entity258 feel terrorized by the group , they also live in daily fear of @entity8 drone strikes			0
youth activist @entity324 said a @entity8 strike in @entity1 would merely create another generation of terrorists in the region			0
" the @entity8 will regret any attack in @entity1 ... @entity159 are peaceful , but they are being attacked by the @entity156			0
these attacks will make thousands of people join @entity300 to avenge the death of their loved ones			0

@entity24 : security tight amid fears @entity4 strikes in @entity1 will destabilize country
@entity115 : scared residents line up at gas - mask distribution centers ; @entity115 *pm* ' ready for anything '
@entity142 : despite world 's military officials meeting there , country says it wo n't be launching pad
@entity102 : many want @entity19 gone , but believe airstrikes will make @entity1 suffering worse
