-- some long - time @entity2 watchers expressed skepticism tuesday over a report by a former @entity6 foreign minister that communist leader @entity7 removed two top - ranking officials earlier this month because they were plotting to overthrow him with the support of @entity11 president @entity10			1
@entity12 , beset by illness , ceded power to his younger brother , @entity15 , pictured , last year			2
@entity16 , who served as @entity6 's foreign minister from 2000 - 2003 , wrote in the march 23 issue of @entity19 , which became public saturday , that deputy prime minister @entity20 and foreign minister @entity21 were concerned that @entity7 would make concessions that would betray the 50 - year - old @entity23			1
" for at least a month or so , @entity24 , @entity21 and others were apparently involved in a conspiracy , betrayal , coup or whatever term one prefers , to overthrow or displace @entity15 from his position , " @entity16 wrote			1
" in this endeavor , they recruited -- or were recruited by -- @entity11 's @entity10 , who in turn tried to enlist the support of other @entity36 leaders , starting with @entity37 of the @entity38 , who refused to get involved			1
" the @entity39 in @entity40 did not answer a verbal and written request for comment			2
the @entity43 in @entity40 did not answer telephones calls at various numbers			2
@entity46 , who served as a @entity36 national security adviser for president @entity48 in the late 1970s , returned saturday from a weeklong visit to @entity2			1
pastor said he wrote @entity16 a letter upon his return expressing his disbelief in @entity16 's contentions			1
" this is @entity16 at his most creative , " @entity50 said tuesday			0
@entity56 , a @entity2 scholar who has written 12 books on the nation , also expressed his doubts			1
" where is this coming from ? " @entity56 asked			0
" i operate with the idea that there has to be some standard of plausibility			0
is there discontent in @entity2 and was @entity24 seen as the heir apparent ? yeah , that 's the conventional wisdom since last year			1
but that there 's a conspiracy between @entity72 and @entity21 ? i do n't think so			1
it would be helpful if the people who write these reports cross the barrier of speculation			0
" @entity16 freely offers that he has no proof , calling his thesis " informed speculation			0
" " i have no way to substantiate any of this , " he said by telephone tuesday from @entity82			0
" i have no evidence of it			0
" instead , @entity16 points to an " enigmatic " comment former leader @entity12 made in a column after the two men were removed			1
" he resorted to a baseball metaphor on the occasion of the @entity92 to praise @entity38 for not participating ( the team 's plans had been unclear ) and to claim that @entity10 's baseball players , ' as good and young ' as they might be , were no match for ' @entity2 's seasoned all - stars , ' " @entity16 wrote in the @entity19 article			1
@entity16 says @entity7 was thanking @entity38 president @entity37 and sending a veiled message to @entity10			1
the former @entity6 official also points to @entity10 ' silence on the removal of the two men as further proof that he was involved			1
the two fired functionaries were acting out of loyalty to the revolution , @entity16 wrote			1
@entity12 , beset by illness , ceded power to his younger brother last year			0
most analysts see @entity12 as the more idealistic and doctrinaire of the two brothers , while @entity15 is viewed as more pragmatic			0
" their reasons for wishing to unseat @entity15 were mainly turf and power , " @entity16 wrote , " but they also feared that the leader was beginning to feel threatened by the reaction of the @entity2 people to excessive economic and social deprivation , and after his brother 's demise would be unable to control the flow of events			1
consequently , he would accept a series of economic and political reforms to normalize relations with the @entity126			0
... " they believed this to be a betrayal of the revolution , and @entity131 of its survival			2
" according to @entity16 , @entity7 detected the plot and went to his brother and gave him an ultimatum : support him or the plotters			1
@entity12 agreed to back his brother , @entity16 wrote			0
the @entity7 brothers then called in @entity10 and gave him a " devil 's alternative : back off , while maintaining economic support for the island , or lose his @entity2 security detail and intelligence apparatus , exposing himself to coups and assassination attempts from eventual @entity11 replacements			1
he chose to stick with the @entity148			0
" @entity16 acknowledges that @entity50 and others have criticized him but says , " i ask that they offer a better explanation			0
" says pastor , " most of them are quite conventional explanations			0
everyone knew he was going to change the @entity156			0
the only question was when the changes would be			0
" @entity7 was merely trying to make the government more efficient , @entity50 said			1
" what was he doing ? " he asked			0
" merging different ministries , trying to decentralize and strengthen the government 's capacity to undertake economic reforms			2
" but @entity16 points to the manner in which the two men were removed as proof that there was more to it than just a change in government			2
why were n't @entity24 and @entity21 given ambassadorships or other face - saving posts , as is often done in cases like this , he asked ? instead , @entity16 said , the men were stripped of all posts and made to sign letters in which they confessed to unspecified " mistakes			2
" and one day after the two men were removed , @entity12 wrote in his column that they were ousted after they became seduced by the " honey of power , " which led them to an " unworthy role			2
" @entity7 further said the two men had reawakened the illusions of " foreign powers " regarding @entity2 's future			1
@entity16 says @entity7 was worried about what would happen after @entity12 dies and was trying to avert a succession battle			1
@entity21 , 43 , might have been perceived as a threat			0
" @entity21 was popular in @entity2 ; his youth , his humble origins , his combative nature all brought him closer to the people than most @entity2 bureaucrats , " @entity16 wrote in @entity19			1
pastor notes that the decision to remove the two men was not popular			0
" there was pushback in @entity2 among the [ @entity203 ] cadres and the public who said , " we 've connected with these two people			1
why are they going ? " @entity50 said			0
" they did n't feel the government had given an adequate explanation for changing those individuals			0
they were concerned about the language of the resignations and about @entity12 's comments			2
" interestingly , @entity50 said , " they blamed @entity12 more than they seemed to blame @entity15			0
" @entity56 , the @entity2 scholar , also noted @entity12 's apparent passing from power			1
" nobody speaks of @entity12 anymore , " @entity56 said			0
" he 's a non-presence			2
out of sight , out of mind			0
the only time anyone speaks of him is when they are asked about him			2
