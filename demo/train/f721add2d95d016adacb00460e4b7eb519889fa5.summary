in 2010 , one of the announced games that drew the most favorable reaction was " @entity6 : uprising			1
" a follow - up to the original " @entity6 " title that came out 25 years ago , this new version offers updated graphics , classic boss battles and humorous dialogue that , unfortunately , quickly becomes cheesy and trite			1
the story harkens back to the original as the forces of light battle the forces of @entity17 with the player acting as the champion for @entity20			1
the angel hero , @entity22 , must set out once again with the help of the goddess of @entity20 , @entity6 , to defeat @entity25 and end the threat to the human race			1
players control pit with the device 's circle pad and use its stylus to aim and turn him			1
firing his weapon is done with the left shoulder button on the @entity1			1
fortunately , the game comes packed with a nifty stand , because trying to hold and maneuver gameplay was quite the contortion			1
even using the stylus after a while became painful in my wrist			0
the game does remind you from time to time to take a break , so perhaps the developers thought there might be a problem			2
combat is broken down into three sections for each chapter : flight battle , ground battle and boss battle			0
in the air , @entity22 attempts to shoot enemies while continuously flying forward			0
he is able to dodge around the screen but his motion is always moving ahead			0
on the ground ( because apparently this angel has a limit on how much he can fly ) , @entity22 navigates through a series of rooms and pathways , defeating enemies and collecting hearts			2
hearts are the currency by which players can obtain new weapons and skills			1
the boss battles close each chapter , involving classic characters and a combination of nimble dodging and intense firepower			0
the bosses are returning enemies from the original title , but offer new challenges for fans of the franchise			1
the intensity of each chapter can change as well , ramping up the enemies and the loot			0
a device called the @entity91 's @entity90 allows players to spend hearts to adjust the difficulty			1
want to make it easier ? that 'll cost you			0
if you want more , you bet hearts that you can complete the chapter , winning you more hearts			2
pit has nine weapon types at his disposal and can equip one before each chapter			0
ranging from rifles to clubs , each offers special advantages			0
one nice feature is that some weapons can be fused with other weapons to create even more powerful attacks			1
plus , some of the names are really quite charming			0
if there is a downside to the game , it is the dialogue			2
it starts off being funny and cute , but i get the feeling the writers were trying too hard in the later stages of the game			2
there are plenty of silly pop - culture references that do n't quite work in this mythological setting : " happy meal of pain " ? really ? the talk also clashes with the action			2
many times , the dialogue ran on so long that i completed the fight before the characters were done trash - talking each other			2
it ended up almost ruining the entire experience			0
overall , " @entity6 : uprising " does offer some solid combat , some great visuals and a good soundtrack			1
the gameplay is good , and the story does move along at a brisk pace			0
however , it 's hobbled by an uncomfortable playing configuration that cries out for a second circle pad ( @entity149 , anyone ? ) instead of the stylus pointer			0
. " @entity6 : uprising " is available now and only for the @entity1			1
it is rated e 10 + for everyone 10 years old and older due to comic mischief , fantasy violence , and mild suggestive themes			0
this review was done using the @entity1 with no extra hardware attachments .			1
