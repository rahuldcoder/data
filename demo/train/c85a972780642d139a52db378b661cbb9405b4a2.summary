how could that ref not call that ? ! 3			1
@entity5 , wow , man			1
a lot of bad ads. well , that 's basically it			1
did i leave out anything ? these would be your top five @entity15 talking points , would n't you agree ? because if something more interesting happened on @entity15 that 's still got you talking on monday , i would very much like to know what it was			1
f - words overheard in the winning team 's celebration , perhaps ? ( hey , watch your @entity25 mouth , pal ! ) or that guy going 108 yards with a kickoff ? how about a @entity29 mentioned every 10 or 20 seconds on tv ? oh , and that cute @entity31			1
and the losing team 's quarterback , @entity32			1
and there were those sweet kids from @entity37 , singing " @entity38 " so beautifully , alongside the increasingly beautiful @entity39			0
ok , i suppose somebody out there might be talking about some of these things , too			0
i personally thought @entity29 's @entity45 34 , @entity46 's 49ers 31 was a truly cool @entity15 , possibly one of the 10 best ever played			1
i have sat through quite a few bad , bad @entity15 in my day , including one inside this same @entity48 dome where a 49ers team beat the living gumbo out of a @entity52 team			1
compared to that clinker , trust me , sunday 's game between @entity45 and @entity54 was a classic			1
but it sure did n't start out that way			0
kickoff came in the late afternoon in @entity60 , where i watched @entity61 on a @entity63 - inch screen			1
it was still light outdoors out west as the game drew close to halftime , and the score was so one - sided -- @entity45 was up by 21 - 3 at one point -- i reached for the remote control of my tv			1
let 's see , what else was on ? @entity73 : " @entity75 " competition			2
@entity76 : @entity77 vs. @entity80 women 's gymnastics			1
@entity81 : a rerun of " @entity83 " ( what a surprise )			0
" no , i stuck with @entity88 , where , on their way to the locker room , the 49ers also appeared to be the walking dead			2
@entity5 came out next and sang -- really sang , not like at @entity94 's inauguration			1
and then her two old teammates from @entity96 sang along with her			0
i think they sang " @entity99 , " a song that i believe @entity5 was not asked to sing at @entity94 's inauguration			1
soon the second half began			0
it took approximately 12 seconds for a @entity103 named @entity102 to fly 108 yards for a touchdown			0
@entity45 was now up by 28 - 6 and mr. and mrs. @entity107 's son @entity106 was looking more and more like destiny 's child			2
i picked up that remote once more			0
" @entity112 : " @entity113			0
" @entity114 : " @entity115 and @entity116			0
" @entity117 : " @entity118			0
" @entity119 : " @entity120			0
" a tough choice , obviously			0
i decided no , i can not change this channel now , because i might miss a @entity15 commercial that everybody else will be buzzing about tomorrow			1
maybe a funny one with a talking baby or a chimpanzee			0
maybe a sexy one with somebody classy like @entity129 or @entity115 or @entity116			0
then the whole screen went dark			0
the players on my tv were suddenly harder to see than @entity134 's girlfriend			1
i sat there squinting until i realized that the @entity48 ' combination football stadium and hurricane shelter had just blown a fuse			0
a power blackout caused an interruption to the tv event everybody wanted to see , or at least everybody who did n't prefer watching @entity77 vs. @entity80 women 's gymnastics			1
a lot of perplexed , mixed - up people began running around in that dome , some of them probably calling @entity150 to make sure that the city had remembered to mail in the february payment			2
a number of lame jokes made the rounds -- yes , this is why the 49ers play their home games in a park called @entity159 -- and i was asked by more than one person what would happen if @entity48 failed to get the lights back on			1
i lied that the game would be moved to @entity164 and played on @entity15 tuesday			1
thirty - four long minutes later , lights , camera , action			0
it was ok to play			2
somebody ( maybe @entity169 ? ) did a heck of a job			0
up to then , everything had been going @entity45 's way			2
@entity25 was having a @entity178 kind of day at quarterback , @entity176 was throwing blocks the way @entity182 taught him to in that movie , @entity175 ran hard and @entity184 apparently made a lot of tackles , because those tv guys kept talking and talking and talking about @entity184 , even though i did n't actually see him make tackles			2
@entity189 , but as soon as @entity190 ( or whoever they called ) screwed in all the new light bulbs , the @entity15 looked entirely different			1
@entity194 began making great plays at quarterback for the 49ers , giving himself a great big kiss on the arm for a job well done			2
@entity194 's the kind of kid who would pour @entity203 over his own head after a win			2
we had ourselves a football game all of a sudden , @entity54 coming within two points , 31 - 29			2
i should have seen it coming because the 49ers never choke in a big game			1
i ca n't recall the @entity212 ever playing poorly in a @entity15 , just as i ca n't recall the @entity212 ever playing a good game before the @entity214 had a @entity15			1
could they actually win this game ? could they solve @entity45 's defense one more time -- as soon as @entity88 ran 20 or 30 more commercials ? @entity221 , as @entity222 almost never says to @entity223			1
he got the 49ers within striking distance			2
the @entity45 were trapped between a pit and a pendulum			0
a pass was thrown , lobbed high above @entity231 receiver @entity230 's head , but @entity232 of the @entity45 seemed to have @entity230 in his pincers			2
would it be called pass interference ? would it be a first down for the 49ers , a yard or two away from a winning touchdown ? would @entity194 run for a score and then kiss himself on the mouth ? nope , no flag			2
no call by the ref on that pass			1
maybe he lost it in the lights			0
it was a memorable ending			0
certainly more memorable than most of the commercials , which did n't even star any funny chimps			0
@entity45 's post-game celebration was colorful and wild			2
@entity25 apparently could be heard by tv viewers using some bad flaccin ' language			0
he also accepted an award for being voted the @entity256 of the game , but at least he did n't accidentally say that he was going to flaccin ' @entity258			0
another big game had come and gone			0
i am sure that many of you would agree that this was one of the best @entity15 that you have ever seen			1
you know , except for the dark part			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity269 .			1

@entity269 : @entity61 seemed headed for a blowout -- until the blackout
the @entity29 vs. @entity29 game suddenly got a lot closer as the 49ers came alive
among the *highlights* : @entity5 's halftime show , ref 's failure to call a *penalty* on a decisive play
@entity269 : overall , one of the ten best @entity15
