-- it was a year ago this month that @entity3 singer @entity2 died of alcohol poisoning at 27			1
the " @entity5 " singer had a very close relationship with her father , @entity7 , and he recently released a book , " @entity2 , my daughter			1
" it is a bracingly honest account of @entity2 's problems with heroin , alcohol and men			1
but it 's not all gloomy			1
the book is also an intimate and tender account of his daughter , who he says was cheeky , funny and a good , but troubled , soul			1
the elder @entity2 , a @entity22 taxi driver and sometime jazz singer , recently spoke to @entity0 about his only daughter			1
@entity0 : why did you write this book ? @entity2 : first of all , i felt that the book would help me with my recovery , and then there were lots of misconceptions about @entity2 after she passed away , so i wanted to set the record straight			1
i wanted people to see who the real @entity2 was , what a lovely girl she was			1
also we have set up a foundation in the @entity40 and the @entity3 , and we needed the money			2
a great way of raising money was to write a book			1
all the author proceeds go to the foundation			2
@entity0 : it must have been very difficult for you to write			2
winehouse : writing the book was n't too difficult actually			1
i was kind of in the zone , but when i had to read it back for the edits , that was really tough			2
that was more difficult than writing the book			1
@entity0 : what do you want people to know about @entity2 ? winehouse : certainly what a great wit she had , how funny she was , how generous she was			1
people still think she died of an overdose or that she committed suicide			2
i want people to know she had quit drugs for three years , that 's important to me			1
@entity0 : you really get a sense from reading your book how hard it is to deal with loved ones struggling with addiction			1
winehouse : i pretended to have heart attacks just to shock her , nothing worked until she was ready to quit			2
when she was ready , she told me and she quit in december 2008			2
she was clean from drugs for nearly three years			0
@entity0 : in the end , it was the alcohol that got her			0
winehouse : often one addiction can follow another			0
she was dealing with that			0
the last six weeks of her life she was abstinent			0
that 's even more difficult to deal with			1
that 's a typical pattern of someone moving toward total abstinence			1
she was on the course for full recovery			0
@entity98 will get you quicker than heroin			0
people think because it 's socially acceptable , it 's safe			1
what it does to people is just incredible			0
@entity0 : they say time heals all wounds , but i do n't think that 's true when you lose a child			2
winehouse : it 's pretty much like being a drug addict			2
you take every day as it comes			0
you 're never fully recovered			0
after a reasonable amount of time , you 're able to function like everybody else , but of course you 'll never fully recover from something like that			0
@entity0 : does it make you sad that she only released two albums ? winehouse : i 'm really not that displeased she did n't write any more albums			0
it might sound a ridiculous thing to say			0
the last album particularly took a lot out of her emotionally , every song was autobiographical , dragged from her soul , and i would n't want her to have made more albums like that because she would have been in constant turmoil			1
i 'm pleased that she did n't write more albums like that actually			0
@entity0 : she had a tattoo that read " @entity151			0
" winehouse : we had a great relationship			0
she had a great relationship with her mum and my wife and her brother and all her uncles and aunts			0
she was just a wonderful family girl			0
i want people to understand that she was just a normal girl who had an extraordinary talent .			0

@entity2 's father , @entity7 , has written a book about her
he says her last album took a lot out of her emotionally
this month marks the one - year *anniversary* of her death
