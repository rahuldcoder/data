" it is just amazing			0
i did n't really expect it after my first run that was far from perfect , " said @entity9 , who was sixth after the opening leg			0
" even after crossing the finish line in the second run , my feeling was n't that good			0
i thought that was not going to be enough for the win			2
the upper part did n't work out the way i wanted but i pushed in the lower section and it paid off			0
" it was the 2011 world champion 's second successive slalom victory after topping the podium in the @entity38 earlier this month			1
" tying the record in @entity41 took some pressure off , " she said			2
" but i was still very nervous today			0
it is always special to race at home			0
i am extremely happy right now			0
" @entity46 teenager @entity45 , who won the world title in february , followed up her third place in saturday 's giant slalom at the same venue by taking second ahead of @entity53 's @entity52			1

@entity73 's @entity72 , who won the last downhill in @entity75 , was third			0
" @entity66 is a tough race			1
usually it is decided on the last section ; when everyone is tired you have to try and push that bit extra , " @entity61 said			2
" i am going south to do some windsurfing and relax on the beach for four days over @entity84 's			0
i want to have some fun before the @entity11 continues in january			2
