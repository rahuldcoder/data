-- when i started the @entity3 program , i was a big guy			1
seven months later , i 'm still a big guy			1
i 've run endless miles , biked endless hills , swum endless laps			1
is there less of me ? yes			2
am i fitter ? yes			2
am i healthier ? absolutely			2
but am i finished ? no way ! there has been quite a debate raging in recent years about whether you can be " fat and fit			2
" there 's no easy answer to that question			2
perhaps the answer changes from person to person as our goals change			1
over the years , everyone in the @entity3 family has achieved great success , but in many cases , the pounds do n't always dramatically disappear			2
we 've all gained strength and improved our cardiovascular health , but i never thought of this as a weight - loss program			0
at least for me , the real changes have been in my body composition ( more muscle and less fat ) , my overall endurance and my mental toughness			1
i 've learned that being healthy is ultimately about being honest with myself			0
it 's about being honest about what i can accomplish and what i can expect to accomplish in the short - and long - term			1
i think i would be doing myself and my health a disservice if i accepted the premise that i could be fat and fit , or at least as fit as i want to and can be			0
while i 'm healthier now that i was at the beginning of the year , i still have improvements to make and fitness to gain			1
i hope to continue making gains for the rest of my life			0
good health : the best birthday present we all joined this program for different reasons , but the one thing that united us is that we wanted to take steps toward better health through a more active lifestyle , for ourselves and for the people we love			0
the one thing that @entity3 has taught me is that i now know where i want to go , and i feel like i 'm better prepared mentally and physically to get there			0
getting what you want does n't always come easily			0
i am about to achieve my short - term goal of finishing the @entity60			1
i did n't expect to cross the finish line as an elite racer , but i did expect to become healthier person			1
setting goals is really pretty simple , when you think about it			1
a goal is something for which you 're willing to work			1
and you get what you want by planning and putting that plan into action			0
i have more goals to set and more success to achieve			1
training for a tri : what i wish i 'd known the only true measure of my accomplishments is to compare myself to how far i 've come and to see how much farther i have to go			0
most importantly , i 've come to understand that fitness is a journey and not a destination			0
and i 'm just getting started			0
