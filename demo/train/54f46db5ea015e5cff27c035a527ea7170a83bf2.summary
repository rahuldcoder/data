-- is there a worse city in the world to be marked out as a tourist ? maybe , but we have n't been sneered at by a waiter there yet			1
but you do n't have to be the bumbling out of towner			2
stick to a few rules ( actually 11 ) and you 'll fit right in			1
bone up on the latest films and exhibitions dinner chat in @entity16 is dominated by culture and opinions , so read @entity19 or @entity20 for the latest			2
@entity19 comes out around 3 p.m. , so you can easily grab a copy and read the headlines en route to le diner -- nobody will pay that much attention to what you say , anyway , before interrupting			1
in october , you can join the strutting vernissage ( opening night ) of the @entity31 , a contemporary art fair and annual glam gathering			2
in the celluloid division , be sure to mention seeing an obscure independent film at the slick @entity36 ( @entity38 site only )			1
sort out the coffee minefield -- fast always drink a @entity16 espresso after lunch or dinner , never white coffee , ordering simply " un café " to designate the little black one			1
for breakfast , do n't ask for soupy café au lait , but rather the stronger crème , petit or grand			2
a noisette ( macchiato ) is also standard			2
unless you 're in or near one of the top patisseries , croissants in cafés are often tasteless sponges			2
but as a @entity16 you should be whippet thin , anyway , and rarely in need of bread products			2
to really do the coffee thing right , sit for a few hours over a black coffee , moodily flicking through a paperback or @entity19 , though in reality people - watching from behind your @entity66			1
treat waiters as equals @entity16 waiters are professionals , not students or unemployed actors , and they expect to be treated with respect			2
bark your order , make a smart insider joke ( reference latest political scandal ) and drop a few coins before you sweep onward			2
stand up to civil servants develop a snippy attitude toward any fonctionnaire ( civil servant ) , who are notoriously tough , even obstructive , nuts in @entity38			1
do n't be cowed -- keep the upper hand by using an assertive , informed tone			1
the fonctionnaire revels in the power they wield from desks on which a bottle of mineral water is firmly planted -- they believe it makes them lose weight			1
their jobs are for life , and resignation is unheard of			0
how to dress -- women wear primarily black , keeping a casual , just out of the sheets look by day and a more primed , predatory look by night			1
accessories are key so invest heavily in shoes and watches			0
perfumes follow , preferably something ethereally obscure from @entity107 or @entity108			0
kit yourself out at @entity110 ( 111 boulevard @entity111 , +33 01 42 77 00 33 ) , the cult concept store near the @entity114 , or at the style emporium @entity116 in the rue @entity117 ( no. 213 ; +33 1 55 35 33 90 )			0
adopt a younger lover for illicit coffees in the romantic backstreets of the @entity121 , and use a @entity123 ( hired bike ) to get around , no helmet of course			0
how to dress -- men like the iconic existentialist pinup , @entity128 , turn up your ( black ) coat or jacket collar , stick a gauloise in your mouth and puff away -- or pretend to			1
smoking is still cool and even in deep midwinter pavement café heaters cater to the inveterate nicotine fiend , environment be damned			0
@entity139 is another defunct role model , a poetic , rock ' n ' roll roué who managed to sing with a cigarette drooping from his lower lip and stiff drink in hand			0
the @entity16 celeb not to model yourself on is @entity149 , a perma - tanned crooner of beyond pensionable age			0
shun the suburbs only stay intramuros no respectable @entity16 lives outside the city , as the very word banlieue ( suburb ) brings shivers to their stylish souls			0
the faubourgs , once looked down upon as too prolo ( proletarian ) , are now considered ultra-hip , with more space at less cost			0
if you decide on an extended stay , first - floor apartments with high ceilings are tops , though a fifth floor walk - up is perfectly acceptable			0
kitchens are n't important , as you always eat out			0
learn to be a flâneur , i.e. stroll aimlessly you need no specific goal to your day , just cruise the boulevards , bookshops and cafés or drape an arm around your girl / boyfriend on the banks of the @entity180			1
in summer , stretch out on the sand of @entity182 to show off your toned body and ogle others			0
never stroll along the @entity185 , which is only for non-parisians and people eyeing up big cars			1
favored " bo bo " ( bourgeois bohemian ) ambling areas are the @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193			0
the @entity121 's @entity194 is for students and tourists , while @entity197 is for aging artists and moneyed " intellos " ( intellectuals ) , à la @entity199			1
get something going on the side you may not be in town long enough to pull it off , but attitudes toward sex are liberal in the extreme , so you might follow the example of @entity211 who commonly have lovers			0
women generally cultivate younger or married men -- the expression " de cinq à sept " ( from 5 to 7 p.m. ) refers to such after - work activities			1
president @entity217 had a mistress holed up with their love - child in an official apartment for years			1
@entity221 was known for a string of affairs , while even bland @entity224 doubled up on the mother of his children			0
@entity227 was so smitten with @entity228 he may have been the only @entity16 without a lover			0
develop an utter disdain for money for @entity211 money is n't a topic for discussion			0
never compare salaries or even refer to the exorbitant cost of a restaurant			1
it 's bad form to check a bill -- although it 's sometimes rewarding			1
it 's worth cultivating the maître d'hôtel of a grand brasserie to be sycophantically swept to your favorite table on arrival			2
that 's when you know you 're a true @entity16			2
learn @entity38 nobody will really accept you , of course , unless you speak @entity254			1
once you have the basics , sprinkle them liberally with @entity257 words such as " cool , " " look " ( as in a style ) , " weekend , " " design " and " trench " ( not warfare , but a belted raincoat )			0
remember that the innate sense of " les @entity264 " ( a catchphrase for the @entity266 and @entity267 ) is negative , while " @entity268 " ( treacherous @entity269 ) crops up regularly			0
@entity211 nonetheless show a grudging respect for @entity266 culture and history , particularly given that the @entity273 broke away from perfide @entity268			0
now resident in @entity276 , freelance travel writer @entity274 spent 18 years living in @entity16 .			1

writer who lived in @entity38 *capital* for almost 20 years reveals how to fit in
sort out the coffee minefield -- fast
learn to stroll aimlessly
never check a restaurant bill -- not when anyone 's looking , anyway
