after a grand jury decided in november not to indict police officer @entity3 in the fatal shooting of @entity5 in @entity6 , many shifted their attention to a federal investigation into the killing			1
but on wednesday , officials told @entity1 that federal investigators did n't find enough evidence and that @entity14 prosecutors wo n't recommend civil rights charges against @entity3			1
attorney general @entity16 , who has the final say in the matter , has said he will announce his decision before he leaves office , which is expected to be by the spring			2
the news that emerged wednesday is likely to upset those who saw the federal investigation as a way to pursue justice for @entity5 and his family			1
" i think you have a lot of people who will be disappointed if this does turn out to be the case , " said @entity27 , a @entity28 city alderman who lives near @entity6			2
" the community and the family wanted a day in court , an opportunity to see all the evidence laid out , cross-examined			0
and it looks like that 's not going to happen			0
" some legal experts , however , said the prosecutors ' decision was n't surprising in light of the laws involved			0
but this does n't mean that all legal avenues are closed off for the @entity5 family			1
first , let 's explore why analysts are n't surprised by the news			0
" these cases are very hard to bring , " said @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity52			1
" if someone is not prosecuted on state charges , the odds that they will be prosecuted on federal charges are substantially lower , " @entity52 told @entity1 's @entity54			1
@entity16 had already acknowledged at the situation in november , saying that " federal civil rights law imposes a high legal bar in these types of cases			1
" but he also may have raised some people hopes , according to @entity65 , an attorney			0
" @entity16 traveled to @entity6 , he talked to that community and he talked about how aggressive the @entity14 was going to be in its own independent investigation , " @entity65 told @entity1			1
the @entity5 family does n't appear to have been holding out much hope from the federal investigation			1
family attorney @entity70 had expressed pessimism in november about the probable outcome			1
" that is a very high standard and it 's not very likely , " @entity70 said			0
" the family understands if there is no indictment it is likely the killer of their child wo n't be held accountable and that 's heartbreaking to them			0
" @entity65 said the federal hate crimes statute was n't designed for cases like this one			0
" i think there 's a lot of confusion about the federal hate crimes statute and how it should be used , " she told @entity1			2
the key factor in the investigation was likely to be whether @entity3 exhibited " racial hostility , " @entity52 said in august			1
" the most important thing would be , did he say anything that indicates racial hostility , either before , or after , or during ( the shooting ) ? " @entity52 said			2
@entity3 is white , and @entity5 was african - american			2
but race did n't have to be a factor in the shooting for investigators to allege there was a federal civil rights violation , said @entity1 legal analyst @entity106			1
federal statute says it 's a crime for government officials " to willfully deprive a person of a right or privilege protected by the @entity112			0
" federal prosecutors could have argued that @entity5 's right to life was violated , @entity106 , a criminal defense attorney , said			2
but it 's a tough case to make			0
" they have to show that the officer intended to deprive somebody of that constitutional right , " he said			0
" they would have to show intent to kill ... which is not a particularly easy showing to make			0
" --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- -- so , what avenues are still open for the @entity5 family ? legal experts still expect @entity5 's family to file a civil lawsuit against @entity3 and the @entity130			1
@entity70 said in november that the family is considering the option of civil remedies to obtain " some sense of justice			2
" the family could file a wrongful death lawsuit against @entity3 and the @entity130 , @entity1 legal analyst @entity136 said at the time			1
he said @entity5 's family could file a lawsuit under @entity140 of the @entity141 -- a federal statute that permits damages against state officials for violations of legal or constitutional rights			1
another @entity1 legal analyst , @entity147 , noted in november that law enforcement officers are afforded certain legal protections			1
@entity3 's attorney , @entity150 , told @entity1 that he was expecting a civil suit from @entity5 's family			1
but he said he thought they would have a difficult case to make			0
" even though it 's a different standard , in a civil case , you still have elements you have to prove and they 're going to flow very closely to what you have to prove in a criminal case , " @entity150 said			0
" if you do n't have enough for a grand jury even to issue an indictment , it 's going to pretty hard , i think , in a civil suit , " he said			2
the @entity14 is also carrying out a civil rights investigation into the @entity130 's overall track record with minorities			2
that inquiry is examining accusations that the police department as a whole practiced racial profiling and heavy - handed tactics			0
but that type of investigation typically looks at possible reforms for a law enforcement agency , rather than punishing past alleged misconduct , analysts say			0
" people consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents , from general policing practices and from the lack of diversity on the @entity6 police force			1
these anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in @entity6 that has received a good deal of attention , " @entity16 said in september			0
" our investigation will assess the police department 's use of force , including deadly force			0
it will analyze stops , searches and arrests			0
and it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at @entity6 's city jail , " @entity16 said			0
@entity3 resigned from his position as a @entity6 police officer in november .			1

" these cases are very hard to bring , " says @entity1 legal analyst @entity52 .
