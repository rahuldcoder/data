-- the design of @entity3 's embassies overseas might seem at best a mere question of bricks and mortar or a relatively arcane issue in a time of big challenges			1
but as we wage a global battle for hearts and minds , embassies can send a powerful message to people everywhere about what @entity3 stands for			1
as the first impression many foreign people have of the @entity3 , embassies can be another force in our arsenal to convey who we really are , to bring allies closer to us , and , yes , even to make us safer			1
unfortunately , many of our embassies are not sending the right message			1
our diplomats are engaged in heroic and difficult work every day			0
but too often , their buildings -- cold concrete at a forbidding distance , hidden away from city life , with little regard for the local surroundings -- undermine our diplomats ' message and even their mission			1
we need to think creatively about how we can create embassies that protect our diplomats but also project our values			1
for decades , we hired world - class architects to design buildings that inspired people , conveyed our spirit of openness and represented the best of our country			1
tragically , that same symbolic power also attracted the attention of our enemies			2
from the @entity54 hostage crisis to the @entity56 embassy bombings , embassies have been a frequent and deadly target			2
our initial response to the dangers our diplomats faced was to hunker down			0
diplomats were shunted from urban settings and city centers , where our diplomatic partners reside , and placed in distant suburban locations -- often far from any government ministries or agencies			2
speeding up embassy construction and updating facilities to protect our diplomats against terrorist attacks was sorely needed			0
under secretary of state @entity73 's leadership , the department embarked on a construction program that has led to the completion of 71 new facilities and moved over 20,000 people to safer and more secure buildings since 2001			1
although this effort significantly improved the safety of our diplomats , unique architectural wonders built to last were replaced by a standardized " embassy in a box			0
" they are uniform in appearance and quickly assembled fortresses designed to meet security specifications in one of four sizes -- small , medium , large and extra-large , epitomized by our supersized embassy in @entity95			2
@entity96 , too , got into the act , putting speed and cost ahead of our support for the kinds of iconic embassies we built during the @entity102			2
this contributed to a system where embassy projects are evaluated first and foremost for cost efficiency , with design and location relegated to the status of afterthought			0
such designs and locations are sometimes necessary , but our foreign service officers will be the first to tell you that they make it much more difficult to reach deep into societies to conduct real diplomacy			0
let us be clear : our diplomats risk their lives daily			0
their security will always come first			2
but because diplomats are already taking such risks , we want to empower them to achieve their mission			0
if the job of diplomats is to reach out to people , promote @entity3 values , obtain and share information , and help advance our diplomatic agenda , then we have to build embassies that neither compromise our diplomats ' safety nor their work			1
many are coming to realize that justifiable concerns over security swung the pendulum too far			2
recently , the @entity137 announced the construction of a new embassy in @entity140 , @entity141 , after a highly publicized international architectural competition			0
unlike less welcoming @entity3 embassy designs in places like @entity146 , @entity147 , and @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity140 's facility will feature transparent glass encasing , cutting edge environmentally sustainable design and a central location immediately across the river from @entity155 and the @entity156			1
unfortunately , this innovative approach remains the exception , not the rule			0
we need to recalibrate our approach globally and reconnect our embassy construction with the core mission of diplomacy			0
the @entity164 is an important first step in a different direction			0
it establishes a design excellence program at the @entity137 to instill new thinking , and a design advisory board to provide recommendations on how to integrate the most modern security requirements with a new generation of bolder , more innovative , energy - efficient and sustainable high performance embassies			1
the bill also directs the @entity137 to ensure new embassies adhere to the highest standards of energy efficiency and sustainability			2
we ask countries to transform the way they use energy ; our overseas construction represents an important sign of our good faith and a chance to lead by example			0
above all , the legislation represents an explicit political commitment to an essential truth : inevitably , our embassies and consulates project our values			1
they should be public expressions of openness , innovation and boldness			0
every day , our enemies try to sell the world a distorted vision of an unwelcoming @entity3 indifferent to the concerns of people everywhere			1
our embassies need to help our diplomats to tell the world the truth			1

authors : @entity3 embassies are @entity3 's face in another country and **reflect** our values
they say distant concrete boxes with no regard for surroundings do *n't* win hearts and minds .
authors : enemies sell the world a distorted vision of an unwelcoming , indifferent @entity3
they write : security a must , but buildings must **reflect** innovation , welcome
