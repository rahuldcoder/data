-- @entity2 health officials said wednesday they have found a contaminant in a blood - thinning drug produced by @entity5 that has been linked to more than a dozen deaths in the @entity2			1
the drug can keep potentially life - threatening blood clots from forming in the veins , arteries , and lungs			1
in early february , the @entity12 launched an investigation and then a recall of some forms of the product			1
the scrutiny began after a spike in reports of health problems associated with heparin , a drug made by @entity5 from pig intestines at plants in @entity25 and @entity26			2
though the cause of the problems has not been determined , @entity12 investigators found " a heparin - like compound -- that is not heparin -- present in some of the active pharmaceutical ingredients " in both facilities , said dr. @entity35 , acting director of the @entity12 's @entity36			1
the contaminant , which made up 5 percent to 20 percent of each sample tested , " reacts like heparin in some of the conventional tests used for heparin , " which explains why it was not picked up , she told reporters in a conference call			1
no causal link between the contaminant and the adverse events has been established yet , @entity35 said			0
she added that it was not clear whether the contaminant was added accidentally , as part of the processing or deliberately			1
it also was not clear whether the contaminant was introduced in the company 's plant in @entity26 or the one in @entity25 , @entity35 said			1
though she said the exact structure of the contaminant has not been identified , " it is similar to heparin glycans			2
" glycans are polysaccharides , a complex class of carbohydrate			0
she added it was unclear whether other heparin products used outside the @entity2 might also contain the product			2
later this week , the agency will release recommendations on how manufacturers and regulators can screen for the contaminant , she said			0
last year , pet food made in @entity25 was found to be tainted with an ingredient that replaced more expensive protein and that initial tests did not identify as a contaminant			2
asked if the heparin contamination could be a similar case , @entity35 said , " it 's possible			2
" doctors have used the blood - thinner for 60 years with " no history of any problems whatsoever , " said the @entity12 commissioner , dr. @entity81			1
its intravenous use can keep potentially life - threatening blood clots from forming in the veins , arteries and lungs			0
@entity88 said it would be " disingenuous " to expect the agency would be able to inspect " every institution in every case			0
" over the last fiscal year , the agency reported having inspected more than 1,000 foreign plants , a record			0
since the agency issued its report that 19 deaths had been linked to the drug since january 1 , 2007 , it has received word of another 27 deaths , " but many of those do not fit our definition of this type of event , " @entity35 said			1
in all , the @entity12 has received 785 heparin - linked reports of adverse events -- including difficulty breathing , nausea , vomiting , excessive sweating and plummeting blood pressure that can lead to life - threatening shock			1
" they 're continuing to come in fairly rapidly because there has been a lot of reporting of this , " she said			0
in a written statement , @entity5 said its tests have suggested " that the root cause may be associated with the crude heparin , sourced from @entity25 , or from the subsequent processing of that product before it reaches @entity5			2
" meanwhile , @entity126 , which supplies the company with the active pharmaceutical ingredients , issued a statement saying it is working with the @entity12 , @entity5 and outside experts to identify the cause of the adverse events			0
" thus far , no conclusions have been reached about the root cause , " it said			0
" it is premature to conclude that the heparin active pharmaceutical ingredient sourced from @entity25 and provided by @entity137 to @entity5 is responsible for these adverse events			0
" it said that its voluntary recall of suspect product was being made as a precaution			0

@entity12 investigators find " a heparin - like compound -- that is not heparin "
tests did not pick up the contaminant because it reacts like heparin
@entity12 : it 's not clear whether the contaminant was added accidentally or deliberately
at least 19 deaths have been linked to the drug since 2007
