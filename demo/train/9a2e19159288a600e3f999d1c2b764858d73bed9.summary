-- @entity2 foreign ministers on monday imposed new sanctions on the @entity5 regime , urging it to adopt a @entity8 - backed peace plan that so far has failed to stop the mounting carnage			1
at the same time , effects of the @entity5 conflict are being felt in neighboring @entity12 , where clashes have killed at least seven people near @entity15			1
the @entity2 ministers froze the assets of two firms and imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on three people believed to provide funding for the regime , the @entity16 announced			0
it is the 15th time the @entity2 has imposed restrictions on @entity5 since a popular uprising began there early last year			2
" the continuing violence is appalling , " @entity2 foreign policy chief @entity27 said monday , adding that the sanctions are aimed at the regime and not the civilian population			2
" as long as the repression continues , we will continue to put pressure on those responsible for it , " she said in @entity31			0
inside @entity5 on monday , regime forces suffered heavy casualties during clashes in @entity41 , a city that has been pummeled by government forces , opposition activists said			1
the @entity43 said it received " preliminary information that three armored personnel carriers were destroyed and that at least 23 soldiers were killed			2
" elsewhere in @entity5 , at least four people were killed monday , said the @entity48 , an opposition network			1
the dead included a child struck by random gunfire from the regime 's army in @entity54 , the @entity48 said			0
the group also posted reports of the military aiming mortars and heavy artillery at the @entity61 village of @entity62			0
the @entity5 government on monday reported four deaths , including a colonel and lieutenant colonel killed by " armed terrorist groups " in @entity68 and @entity69 , according to the state - run @entity70			1
@entity0 can not independently verify reports of deaths and violence because the @entity5 government has severely restricted access by international media			1
the @entity5 conflict is playing a role in clashes that broke out sunday in neighboring @entity12 , where it has ignited historic divisions among residents of two @entity15 suburbs			1
the fighting in @entity12 pits residents of @entity87 , a @entity89 stronghold hostile to the @entity5 regime , against @entity92 residents of @entity15 , who support @entity5 president and fellow @entity92 @entity94			1
at least seven people have been killed and 45 others hurt in the two days of fighting , @entity12 's @entity95 reported monday			1
islamists in northern @entity12 , specifically @entity15 , have opposed the @entity5 regime for decades			1
but as @entity5 strengthened its control over @entity12 in the 1990s , it also strengthened elements of the @entity92 community , a @entity105 offshoot , in the north			1
the fighting in the @entity15 suburbs is part of the legacy of @entity5 intervention in northern @entity12 , according to @entity112 , associate fellow of the @entity113 and @entity115 program at the @entity117 think tank @entity116			2
it was the arrest of @entity120 activist @entity119 that sparked the current fighting			0
one of his cousins says @entity119 was supporting the @entity5 rebels and trying to help @entity5 refugees by providing shelter and food			0
though the @entity12 government accuses @entity119 of being an operative in an @entity131 - inspired group -- something his relatives deny -- it may have been @entity119 's help to the refugees that got him in trouble			2
helping @entity5 refugees puts the @entity12 government in a difficult position as it tries to stay out of the @entity5 conflict , @entity112 told @entity0			1
" the @entity12 government 's aim is to maintain neutrality and avoid spillover from @entity5 to @entity12 , but that 's an impossible objective to attain because if you help the refugees , you 're supporting the revolution , and if you do n't help the revolution , you 're supporting the regime			1
so in both cases , neutrality is impossible to maintain , " @entity112 said			0
a team of @entity8 monitors is in @entity5 to see how well both sides are implementing a six - point peace plan brokered by former @entity152 secretary - general @entity152			0
@entity152 said last week that the observers are the last hope for success of the plan , which involves a cease - fire by all parties and the withdrawal of @entity5 forces from populated areas			0
since the cease - fire went into effect on april 12 , the fighting and killing have continued , with the @entity48 reporting more than 1,000 deaths in the intervening weeks			0
the @entity8 estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the 14 - month crisis , while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000			0
despite the ongoing chaos , @entity5 state - run media announced that results from recent parliamentary elections will be announced tuesday			0
more than 7,000 candidates vied for 250 parliamentary seats			0
but members of the opposition had urged @entity5 to boycott the elections , saying a vote for any of the candidates amounted to a vote for @entity94 , whose family has ruled the country for 42 years			2
@entity0 's @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .			0
