-- just under ten years ago , the @entity3 - @entity2 physicist @entity1 stumbled across a substance that would revolutionize the way we understand matter and win him and his colleague @entity8 the 2010 @entity9			1
it was graphene -- a one atom thin substance			1
the professor of physics at @entity15 talks to @entity0 about discovering the first ever 2 - dimensional material			2
@entity0 : graphene has been described as a ' miracle material ' , but what exactly is it ? @entity1 : it 's the thinnest material you can get -- it 's only one atom thick			1
a tiny amount can cover a huge area , so one gram could cover a whole football pitch			0
it 's the strongest material we are aware of because you ca n't slice it any further			2
of course , we know that atoms can be divided into elementary particles , but you ca n't get any material that is thinner than one atom , or it would n't count as a material anymore			1
graphene is stronger than diamond ; it shows extraordinary heat conductance ; it conducts electricity a thousand times better than copper -- the list goes on			2
we 're talking about probably 20 superlatives which apply to graphene			2
another surprise is that you can just about see it with the naked eye , even though it 's only one atom thick ! @entity0 : your scotch - tape method for discovering the material has gone down in science history			1
ag : we were trying to make graphite as thin as possible using lab equipment and for many months we struggled to make it thinner than 10,000 layers			2
then we had a kind of @entity60 moment			0
we were using scotch tape on a regular basis in the lab to clean the surface of the graphite			1
we would look at what was happening on the surface of the graphite and throw the scotch tape in the bin			1
then we decided to take the tape out of the bin and look at it under the microscope and we saw really transparent pieces of graphite -- graphene			1
@entity0 : your discovery was certainly a surprise to the science world , but was it a surprise to you ? ag : yes			2
we live in a 3 - dimensional world			0
my physics intuition , developed over the last thirty years , told me that this material should n't exist			0
and if you had asked 99.9 % of scientists around the world they would have said the idea of a 2d material was rubbish and that graphene should n't exist			1
and in most cases they would have been right , but in the case of graphite or graphene , and a dozen other materials like it , our intuition was completely wrong			1
you can reach this limit of one - atom - thin layers			0
@entity0 : but what exactly is graphene useful for ? ag : because of its range of extraordinary properties , people are considering using graphene in a myriad of different applications			0
for example , because graphene is so strong , people want to use it to reinforce plastics , making them conductive at the same time			1
because it 's transparent and conducts electricity , people want to use it in applications like mobile phone screens , touch screens , tv screens and so on			0
people are also considering using it to go beyond silicon technology and make our integrated circuits even denser and speedier			0
those are just few examples			0
@entity0 : what is the future for graphene ? ag : i do n't dare try to predict the future , but if the speed of development of the last ten years is of any guidance we can expect to see graphene everywhere soon			0
typically it takes 40 years for a new material to move from an academic lab into a consumer product , but within less than ten years graphene has jumped from our lab into an industrial lab and now there are pilot products all over the world			1
governments around the world and probably more than 100 companies are spending billions on researching these materials			0
so , it probably deserves the superlative of the fastest developing material as well			0
' @entity148 ' chips away at silicon dominance @entity150 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 and @entity8 discovered graphene in 2004 .
at one atom thick , it is the thinnest material ever discovered .
they made their discovery by pulling scotch tape off graphite .
graphene is very strong , *flexible* and a good electrical conductor .
