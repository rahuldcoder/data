-- " even @entity1 has daddy issues			1
" @entity3 -- who , along with @entity4 , oversaw " @entity6 's " six - season run -- had that to say when asked to compare the story of @entity1 to the story of the tv series for which he 's best known			1
@entity3 is one of a dream team of writers contributing stories to the landmark 900th issue of " @entity16 , " in stores wednesday			1
the others include @entity19 , writer of " @entity20 " and the upcoming film " @entity22 " ; @entity23 , director of " @entity1 : the movie " ; @entity25 , @entity26 ' chief creative officer and one of its most popular writers ; @entity29 , best known for producing " @entity30 " and " @entity1 : the @entity31 " ; and @entity32 , who has been writing " action " since last year and is best known for his work on the " @entity37 " novels and tv series			1
nine hundred issues is the most any monthly comic book has ever published ( though it went weekly for a brief time in the 1980s ) , with the first issue of " action " having introduced the character of @entity1 in 1938			1
( that issue also recently sold for $ 1.5 million			2
) @entity0 recently interviewed @entity3 and @entity32 , separately , about the historic issue and @entity1 's legacy			1
they addressed a few topics of heated fan debate in the process			0
@entity0 : what can readers expect in this 900th issue ? lindelof : obviously , " @entity54 is a landmark issue -- one that covers @entity1 's past , present and future			1
i tried to ( write ) a little story that fits into the myth that we all know but looks at it from a different point of view			0
@entity32 : ( there 's ) an enormous lead story , closing @entity68 's adventure into ultimate power , setting him up against @entity1 in their fight of their lives and then continuing into @entity1 's new ongoing adventure against @entity74			1
with loads of extra features in the back ! @entity0 : what was it like writing for @entity1 ? lindelof : to actually play in a world that was so inspirational to me since i was a kid is nothing less than a dream come true			1
@entity0 : what did you hope to accomplish with your story ? lindelof : my hope was to drum up a little emotion : as heroic as @entity1 is , there is also an inherent sadness to his story			2
i wanted to try to tap that			0
@entity0 : is there anything that 's surprised you about writing the character ? @entity32 : i 've discovered he really needs thought balloons			2
he ca n't show doubt or fear to the world , because he wants to enthuse and support the people around him , but he can doubt and fear inside			0
@entity0 : what have you hoped to accomplish in all of your time writing for him ? @entity32 : to show his essential humanity , especially in comparison to the bad parenting that produced @entity68			2
@entity0 : did you grow up as a @entity1 fan ? @entity32 : i think we all did			1
he 's one of the most recognizable characters on @entity116 , and we all know many details of his life and supporting cast , far more than you would with virtually any other character			2
i think that 's the power of radio , that first mass medium , to establish details in the heads of a truly enormous audience , and it all got passed down from there			0
@entity0 : if you could have one of @entity1 's powers , what would it be ? @entity32 : flight , obviously			1
i 'd love to be able to take off and go visit people in the @entity135			0
customs might be a problem			0
lindelof : i 'm sure everyone picks flight , so in the spirit of being unique , i 'm gon na go with the ability to take the " s " insignia on his chest and make it grow to gargantuan proportions so i could throw it at people and ensnare them ( as demonstrated in " @entity150 " )			0
@entity0 : who is your favorite villain ? @entity32 : it 's obviously @entity68			2
i 've been living in his head for a dozen issues now			0
i think we have a lot in common			0
i just love everything about that guy			0
@entity0 : do you have a favorite incarnation of @entity1 , whether it be in the comics , tv , or movies through the years ? @entity32 : @entity167			1
he sorted it and balanced it so well that everyone else since has been influenced by him			0
lindelof : @entity171 will always be @entity1 to me ... but as far as comics go , you 're never gon na do better than @entity176 's " @entity175			2
" @entity0 : can you settle this ongoing debate : is superman @entity180 's secret identity , or the other way around ? @entity32 : @entity180 is a real person who acts slightly more bumbling at the @entity183 and has an interesting ethnic heritage			2
superman is the job he puts on a uniform to do , and like a cop , he 's a somewhat more serious person when he 's doing it			0
lindelof : as i 'm of the belief that everything uttered in " @entity193 " has to be right , i have to agree with @entity194 on that one			0
( @entity194 's character , @entity195 , argued that @entity180 was @entity1 's secret identity			1
) @entity0 : what can we expect beyond issue no. 900 ? @entity32 : a huge fight against @entity74 for the next several issues , with @entity1 and a bunch of his friends repeatedly saving the world			1
that 's what everyone 's after !			0
