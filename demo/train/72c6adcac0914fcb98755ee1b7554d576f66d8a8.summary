-- having been criticized by his great rival @entity2 for not taking a stand over players ' rights , @entity1 began his bid for a fifth @entity8 title with a comfortable straight - sets victory on monday			1
the 16 - time grand slam champion joined @entity2 in round two , matching the @entity13 's smooth progress in @entity14 with a 7 - 5 6 - 2 6 - 2 win over @entity17 's @entity16			1
@entity18 , making his tournament debut , matched the @entity21 third seed early on as he battled to 5 - 5 in the first set			1
but @entity1 shrugged off pre-tournament back concerns as he conceded only four more games to beat a player who won just three @entity27 matches last year			2
the 30 - year - old , whose last major title came in @entity14 in 2010 , will next play @entity31 's 93rd - ranked @entity30			2
" i really tried to put in an effort to every point , play as hard as i could , first to see how the back felt , try to get into it , hopefully win , and then see how i feel tomorrow , " @entity1 said , before insisting his relationship with @entity2 had not been affected			1
" things are fine between us , you know			0
i have no hard feelings towards him			0
it 's been a difficult last few months in terms of politics within the @entity27 , i guess , trying to find a new ceo and chairman			0
that can get frustrating sometimes			0
but for me , obviously nothing changes in terms of our relationship			0
" his fellow former world no. 1 @entity2 came into the tournament having announced to international reporters that he would no longer be making statements about grievances over scheduling and pay			1
he then told @entity58 media on sunday that he thought @entity27 player council president @entity1 should take more of a public role over issues such as where the @entity61 fits into the busy calendar			2
" his ( position ) is easy : do not say anything , all positive , i am a ' gentleman , ' others get burned			0
we each have our opinion and maybe he likes the circuit			0
me too , i like it , and i think it 's better than most sports			0
that does not mean you can not be better and that you should change things that are bad , " the 25 - year - old said ahead of monday 's 6 - 4 6 - 1 6 - 1 win over @entity77 - born @entity76 qualifier @entity75			1
" i say a lot of good things about tennis , because thanks to this sport i have had experiences in my life i could never have dreamed of , but to finish your career with pain in all areas of your body is not positive			0
" he finishes his career as fresh as a daisy because he is physically privileged , but neither @entity95 nor @entity96 and i are fresh as a daisy			2
" @entity2 , the 2009 champion , had hoped he was over his injury problems going into the two - week event , but revealed after his opening win that he needed an mri scan after hurting his right knee yet again in practice			1
" i was much more scared about the first match than the rest , because today now i have 48 hours to the next match , " said @entity2 , who retired hurt against @entity95 in 2010 and suffered a hamstring injury in last year 's quarterfinal defeat by @entity106			1
" so i am really confident that having had the worst feeling that i ever had in my knee yesterday and today was able to play -- i have fantastic hope that 's going to happen the same for after tomorrow			0
" he also admitted some remorse over his previous day 's attack on @entity1			2
" probably i am wrong telling that to you , especially because these things can stay , must stay in the locker room , " @entity2 said			2
" i always had a fantastic relationship with @entity1			0
i still have a fantastic relationship with @entity1			0
" @entity2 , who could meet @entity1 in the semifinals , will next play @entity31 's former world no. 2 @entity123			1
the 33 - year - old @entity123 , now ranked 190th after years of injury problems , beat @entity77 - born @entity76 resident @entity125 in four sets			2
@entity128 11th seed @entity127 , the last man outside of defending champion @entity96 , @entity2 and @entity1 to win a singles grand slam , progressed with a 2 - 6 6 - 1 7 - 5 6 - 4 win over @entity132 's 91st - ranked @entity131			1
the 2009 @entity134 champion will next play @entity137 's world no. 103 @entity135			1
@entity140 seventh seed @entity138 also went through to round two along with @entity76 no. 8 @entity141 and no. 16 @entity142 , @entity58 no. 10 @entity143 and no. 18 @entity146 , @entity77 's no. 13 @entity147 and @entity21 no. 21 @entity145			1
@entity142 will next play 2006 semifinalist @entity148 , whose @entity150 opponent @entity149 retired with a stomach muscle injury at 6 - 4 4 - 2 down the day after winning the rain - delayed @entity153 title			1
@entity145 will play @entity154 , the 2006 runner - up from @entity156 who lost in the @entity159 semis on friday			0
