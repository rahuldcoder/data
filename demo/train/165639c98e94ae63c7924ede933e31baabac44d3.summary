president @entity0 made a splash by announcing that @entity2 will ease its one - child policy and end its notorious policy of re-education through labor camps			1
this is good news and represents an important step forward in reducing human rights abuses			1
but it would be naive to think this effort will seriously address the human rights problems in @entity2			1
if human rights were the primary concern , more specific actions would have been taken			1
@entity0 and the @entity16 have other priorities			0
under the new family planning policy , couples will be able to have two children if one spouse is an only child			2
until now , both spouses need to be only children or they must be from the ethnic minorities to be allowed to have two children			0
this is a modest change that will mainly benefit the upwardly mobile middle class living in cities			0
the easing of the one - child policy can not end the main abuses associated with it since it does not put an end to forced termination of unauthorized pregnancies , even at very late term			1
nor does it remove power from the local authorities in enforcing the one - child policy , who have regularly been responsible for abuses			1
the changes introduced are meant to deal with the projected decline in population , which would threaten @entity2 's capacity to sustain its economic growth			1
they 're also meant to lessen the burden on the state in looking after the aging population before @entity2 becomes wealthy enough to handle the demands of its " pensioners			2
" the abolishment of the system of " re-education through labor " camps is a much more significant move			2
the existing policy gives local law enforcement agencies the power to detain " undesirables " -- people who are considered social misfits , prostitutes or troublemakers for authorities			2
the government can jail these people for several years and force them to work at next to no wage -- all without going through the judicial process and without receiving a conviction			0
there is absolutely no place for such a policy in any country in the 21st century			0
it 's about time that @entity2 do away with it			2
however , if the @entity16 were committed to tackle human rights abuses , it would have also outlawed other similar practices			1
many of those jailed in labor camps are individuals who had grievances and tried to seek redress			1
some of them were simply petitioners			0
they were deemed by local authorities to have challenged their power , or they were seen as destabilizing elements in society			0
unless the practice of putting petitioners in " black jails " ( informal detention facilities ) is abolished , ending the labor camps will have limited effect in reducing human rights abuses			1
there is no indication other similarly repressive measures will be terminated			0
what the party will achieve is removing a source of discontent toward the government			0
by doing so , @entity0 projects himself as a reformer who is going beyond where his predecessors were willing to do			0
but so far , he has done nothing to allow ordinary citizens to challenge the @entity16 's monopoly of power in any way , or acknowledge that the rights of dissidents or petitioners must be protected			2
what is obvious with these @entity0 reforms is that they are really meant for one purpose only			0
it is to strengthen the capacity of the @entity16 to govern more effectively and to reduce the reasons for the @entity2 population to find the party 's rule objectionable			1
these changes will not alter the nature of the political system at all			0
@entity2 's political system is anti-democratic in nature and is first and foremost dedicated to keeping the @entity16 in power .			1

@entity138 : it 's good that @entity2 ending one - child policy and system of labor camps
he says it would be naive to think that this will erase human rights problems
he says the changes do not *include* outlawing other serious abuses
@entity138 : changes are meant to reduce objections to rule of the party
