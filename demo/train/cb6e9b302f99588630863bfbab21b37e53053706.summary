@entity0 -- eight weeks after an explosion uncorked a massive oil spill into the @entity5 , @entity2 still does not know whether its efforts to stanch the flow will soon succeed , its ceo will testify thursday			1
" we can not guarantee the outcome of these operations , but we are working around the clock with the best experts from government and industry , " @entity9 says in prepared testimony to be delivered before the @entity11			2
@entity9 expresses regret over the disaster			0
" the explosion and fire aboard the @entity24 and the resulting oil spill in the @entity5 never should have happened -- and i am deeply sorry that they did , " he says in his prepared remarks			2
" none of us yet knows why it happened			0
but whatever the cause , we at @entity2 will do what we can to make certain that an incident like this does not happen again			1
" rep. @entity33 , @entity34 , appeared underwhelmed at @entity9 's planned appearance before his committee			2
@entity37 : @entity2 's @entity9 to strike emotional tone " look , he 's a corporate guy , " @entity33 said			1
" at the end of the day , he 's going to put his best foot forward			2
it 's not going to ring true with me or the @entity44 public			2
and we 've got a mess on our hands , a disaster , a catastrophic disaster for our environment and those people who lost their lives			0
he 's just going to say , ' i 'm sorry , it 's not going to happen again			2
' it 's not good enough			2
" @entity33 : lawmakers going to take @entity9 's ' hide off ' but @entity9 plans to say more than that			0
the drilling of two relief wells , " which we believe represents the ultimate solution to stopping the flow of oil and gas from the well , " has reached depths of 15,226 feet and 9,778 feet , respectively , he says , but they are not expected to be completed until august			0
" we have spent nearly $ 1.5 billion so far , and we will not stop until the job is done , " he says			1
day 58 : the latest on the oil disaster though the company has accepted that it is the " responsible party , " @entity9 adds a qualification : " it is important to understand that this ' responsible party ' designation is distinct from an assessment of legal liability for the actions that led to the spill , " he says			0
so far , more than 400,000 barrels of oily water mix have been recovered , and the company has paid more than $ 90 million on the more than 56,000 claims that have been submitted , he says			1
additionally , about $ 16 million is expected to be paid this week to businesses , he says			1
in all , 32 walk - in claims offices are open in @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
nearly 700 people have been assigned the task of handling claims , he says			0
how the oil - disaster flow estimates have evolved @entity9 adds that , though the cause of the disaster remains unclear , his company 's investigation suggests that the accident was caused by the apparent failure of " a number of processes , systems and equipment			1
" " investigations into the causes of the incident are ongoing , and issues of liability will be sorted out separately when the facts are clear and all the evidence is available			0
" the transcript of @entity9 's planned remarks was given to reporters hours after he and other @entity2 executives told president @entity116 that the company will set aside $ 20 billion in an escrow account to compensate oil spill victims			1
the fund " will not supersede individuals ' or states ' rights to present claims in court , " @entity116 said			1
@entity2 , he asserted , will remain liable for the environmental disaster in the @entity5			1
@entity2 chairman @entity126 said that the board of the oil giant has decided not to pay any further dividends this year			1
@entity2 also has agreed to create a $ 100 million fund to compensate oil rig workers now unemployed as a result of closure of other deep - water rigs after the april 20 @entity24 explosion , @entity116 said			1
after taking a beating in recent weeks , @entity2 's stock price closed wednesday at 31.85 , up 1.43 percent for the day			1
the @entity116 administration has tapped attorney @entity139 to mediate the claims process			2
@entity139 played the same role in compensation for the victims of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			0
anyone dissatisfied with @entity139 's handling of their claim will be able to appeal to a three - person panel , then to the federal oil spill liability trust fund and then to court , said @entity152 , the president 's point person on energy and climate change			1
@entity2 has also paid roughly $ 70 million to the @entity156 for cleanup operations , wire transfer receipts showed			1
@entity126 apologized to the @entity44 people for the disaster			0
he said he hoped the company could earn back the trust of the @entity44 people , because " we care about the small people			0
" a few hours later , he issued a statement apologizing for the remark			0
" i spoke clumsily this afternoon , and for that , i am very sorry , " he said			0
" what i was trying to say -- that @entity2 understands how deeply this affects the lives of people who live along the @entity5 and depend on it for their livelihood -- will best be conveyed not by any words but by the work we do to put things right for the families and businesses who 've been hurt			2
like president @entity116 , i believe we made some good progress toward that goal today			2
" @entity2 has been under intense political pressure to ensure that it can cover all costs related to the catastrophic oil spill , the largest in @entity44 history and one that @entity116 described as an " unprecedented environmental disaster			1
" @entity185 : share your views , solutions on @entity189 @entity2 has been siphoning oil from a containment cap placed atop the ruptured well			1
the company said wednesday that it has started collecting oil gushing into the @entity5 through a second containment system attached to the ruptured well			0
the new system is connected directly to the blowout preventer and carries oil up to a second ship , the @entity199			0
by the end of july , officials hope to be able to contain as many as 80,000 barrels of oil per day , said @entity156 adm. @entity204			0
by that time , he predicted , there will be only " minimal leakage " around the wellhead			0
on tuesday , government scientists increased their estimate of oil flowing into the @entity5 by 50 percent -- to between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day			0
that translates into 1.5 million gallons to 2.5 million gallons per day			0
the government 's previous estimate , issued last week , was 20,000 to 40,000 barrels per day			0
@entity116 said wednesday that @entity2 assured him that recovery efforts should capture up to 90 percent of the gushing oil in the coming days and weeks			1
" that is still not good enough , " @entity116 said			2
" we will continue to press @entity2 and draw on our best minds and resources to capture the rest of the oil until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that is expected to stop the leak completely			1
" the spill dwarfs the 11 million gallons that were dumped into @entity230 's @entity229 in 1989 when the tanker @entity232 ran aground , and oil in varying amounts and consistencies has hit the shores of @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity87 and @entity88 .			1
