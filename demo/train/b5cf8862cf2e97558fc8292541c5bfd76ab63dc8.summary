-- if @entity3 followed all of the advice she got about online dating , her username would be " @entity7			1
" @entity8 , a 42 - year - old administrative assistant , checked out a library book about online dating before creating her profile			1
the first step to creating the perfect profile is choosing a user name that reflects your personality , the book said			2
it suggested she combine two of her favorite things or activities			2
" shoes and doughnuts , " @entity8 said			2
" those are two things i feel passionate about			2
" but she did n't think " @entity7 " would strike the right chord			2
so she chose " @entity27			2
" " then i realized it sounded like , " so b * * * * y. " so began @entity8 's adventures in online dating where selecting a user name is only the beginning of an often unpredictable journey			1
online dating and a formula for love the online dating industry claims it 's working			1
one in six recently married couples met on an online dating site , according to a study commissioned by @entity42 in 2009			1
that year , more than twice as many marriages occurred between people who met on an online dating site than between people who met in bars , clubs and other social events , the study reported			1
but of course , all matches do n't lead to the altar			1
after the world learned that @entity56 linebacker @entity55 's online girlfriend never existed , @entity0 invited readers to share their own online dating ups and downs			1
while none were quite as dramatic as the @entity62 scandal , readers agreed : when looking for love in cyberspace , prepare for an adventure			1
@entity8 began online dating at the end of 2011 when she realized she was n't meeting anyone her own age in @entity71 , @entity72			1
the lost art of offline dating " when you 're 43 , it 's tough , " she said			1
" i had no idea where to meet anyone my own age in a college town			2
" so she turned to the @entity81			2
she was serious about potentially finding a match , but she was willing to give most people a chance ... and have a sense of humor about it			2
" i probably think about ' @entity91 ' more than anyone should , " @entity8 wrote in her @entity89 profile			2
@entity8 remembers one date with a news director ( or so she thought ) with vivid detail			1
after talking to the man for a few weeks via text and e-mail , she decided to meet him at a sports bar			2
even though they ordered the same kind of beer , @entity8 did not think they were a match made in heaven			2
" so the waitress brings our beers , and he reached around and he said , ' oh i forgot my wallet , ' " she said			1
" thank @entity110 i had money in my account at that point			0
" online dating : messages you should n't send when they walked out to the parking lot at the end of the date , he told her he did n't have a car			1
as @entity8 drove him home , he also admitted he was unemployed			0
" i 'm really not materialistic , but i just did n't think it would work out , " she said			0
@entity8 said her favorite part of the date was when she texted him later to tell him she did n't think it would work out between them			1
the text he sent her back read : " to think i gave you points for not wearing flip flops			0
" @entity134 met her ex-husband on a computer bulletin board in the 1990s when she still used a dial - up modem			0
in 2007 , @entity134 ended up online again without any romantic intentions			1
how technology has changed romance she started playing the @entity143 online game using an audio - only option on @entity145			1
@entity134 got close to one of the players whom she had never met			0
he was her shoulder to cry on as she was going through a divorce			0
" finally just one day on @entity145 , everybody else had kind of hung up and i said you know , i think i love you , " she said			0
@entity134 and her husband , @entity153 , got married in 2011 , and she attributes her success to the fact that they told each other the truth			0
" we got to know the real us , because we never lied , " @entity134 wrote in her @entity159			0
" i woke up and realized i was in love with a man that i knew better than anyone , yet never laid eyes on			0
" though her experience had a happy ending , she 's heard plenty of stories that did not work out well			0
@entity134 advised to be protective with personal information because it 's easy to lie online			1
" i 've had tons of friends that have fallen for scams or had quote unquote ' buddies ' who died and magically came back from the dead , " @entity134 said			0
" it happens way more often than you realize			0
it 's kind of ridiculous -- after 20 years , when i hear somebody [ online ] say , ' i have cancer ' or whatever , my first instinct is ' hmm , wonder if that 's true			1
' if you fall for it , it 's because you want fall for it			0
" @entity184 within 24 hours of registering on @entity42 in 2010 , @entity185 had three matches " who by all accounts were intelligent , good looking and well off			1
" too good to be true , she thought			0
opinion : what we do n't know about love and loneliness one of her matches said he was " an architect / construction manager who built and designed a building in @entity200 for orphans , " @entity194 , a 48 - year - old divorcee in @entity195 , wrote in her @entity159			1
they corresponded online for a few months , until the man asked @entity194 to pay for his ticket to the @entity206			1
the total would only come out to $ 2,700			0
when she saw the e-mail asking for money , she had a good laugh			0
@entity194 had become suspicious long before he asked for money			0
when she asked the man , who claimed he was an engineer , a physics question , he got it wrong			0
" he thought he had me hooked but little did he know , " she said			0
" after i realized he was a scammer , i decided a little taste of his own medicine was due			0
so i let him get to the ' ask for money ' part and then i shut the door on him			0
" but just when @entity194 thought she was done with online dating , she met her husband in 2011			1
" he looked at my profile , and i sent him a smiley face , " she said			0
" three days later , we had lunch			0
" they bonded over their online dating scammer stories and got married 14 months later			1
even though @entity194 was the victim of a scam , she said she was " extremely blessed " to have found her husband online			2
" for some reason i kept that one profile up and now i have a wonderful man in my life , " she said			0
psychologists highlight pitfalls of online dating whether people are looking to find their soul mate or just to have some fun , @entity8 said it helps to go into online dating with a sense of humor			1
" in online dating and in life , it 's nice to have thick skin , let things roll of your back and move on , " she said			1
" you have to be patient			0
you wo n't put your profile up and be struck by lightning with the perfect person for you			0
" do you have online dating horror stories ? share them in the comments below .			1
