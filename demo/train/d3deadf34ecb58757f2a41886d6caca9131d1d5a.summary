-- the heatwave may have passed at the @entity2 but in its place came shockwaves as women 's title favourite @entity6 crashed out			1
the @entity8 world @entity9 melted under pressure from resurgent @entity12 @entity11 in the fourth round sunday			1
@entity6 , who was chasing a sixth @entity2 crown and an 18th career grand slam , blamed the shock 6 - 4 3 - 6 3 - 6 defeat on an error - strewn display			1
" i made a tremendous amount of errors , shots i missed i normally do n't miss , i have n't missed since the @entity24 , " @entity6 told reporters			1
" i 'm just not used to missing those shots			0
" i just made way , way , a lot of unforced errors			2
" i know for a fact i can play so much better than what i did today , so with that , knowing that , i 'm not disappointed or anything			0
i just know that i can play ten times better			0
" @entity6 refused to blame a back injury for her defeat although the 32 - year - old did reveal that she had considered quitting the opening grand slam of the year before her match against @entity11			1
" i almost pulled out , " explained @entity6 , who last lost a match in august			2
" i 'm such a competitor			0
i mean , i probably should have			0
" maybe i was n't the best physically , but that had nothing to do with it			0
i do n't want to blame anything			0
" i feel like @entity11 deserves all the credit			2
i feel she played unbelievable today			0
" victory for @entity11 is a major boost for the @entity48 champion who is trying to get her career back on track after several seasons plagued by big - match nerves , serving troubles and a series of injuries			1
the 26 - year - old told @entity0 's @entity57 last month that she had effectively pressed the re-set button ahead of the 2014 season , swapping @entity61 coach @entity60 for new coach and hitting partner @entity63			2
" i 've been working really hard , " said @entity11 , who last reached a grand slam quarterfinal at the 2012 @entity65			1
" i have a new team with me since @entity67 and it 's a @entity12 team for me for the first time			1
" the restructure appears to be working as @entity11 won a warm - up tournament in @entity71 -- incidentally beating @entity72 -- before notching up her first - ever win over @entity72 ' younger sister @entity6			1
asked by reporters in @entity74 what the difference was between this match and her previous encounters with @entity6 , she said : " well , i actually believed			2
i had some confidence coming into today 's match			2
" this victory means so much to me			0
all the hard work , it 's paying off			2
" i had very tough fourth round matches in a grand slam , and this was probably the toughest of tough			1
i just went out there to play			0
i had nothing to lose			0
" to have that victory , you know , it 's amazing			2
we all know what kind of champion she is			0
" @entity11 goes on to meet @entity96 @entity95 in the quarterfinals and , after her giant - slaying performance against @entity6 , the @entity12 14th seed might just feel she has a chance of going all the way			1
in the men 's draw , @entity11 's childhood friend @entity102 eased into the quarterfinals with a straightforward 6 - 3 6 - 0 6 - 2 win over another close pal @entity108 @entity107			1
@entity109 , who said he had managed to watch two sets of @entity11 's match before taking to the court , faces @entity114 @entity113 next , who took him to five sets in the fourth round of last year 's @entity2			1
" i have to be ready to play another 12 - 10 in the fifth like last year , " @entity109 said			1
" i know that he 's playing the tennis of his life in the last 15 months			0
" you can not expect a clear favorite in that match			0
" in the same half of the draw , @entity124 @entity123 also advanced to the quarterfinals where he meets @entity129 third seed @entity128 .			0
