the reality is quite different			2
@entity5 was beloved by millions around the world			1
he changed the course of a continent and led a collective awakening of a people once silenced , once exploited and ignored			2
@entity5 was a grandiose visionary and a maker of dreams			1
an honest man from a humble background who lived in a mud hut as a child and sold candies on the streets to make money for his family , @entity5 dreamed of building a strong , sovereign nation , independent of foreign influence and dignified on the world scene			1
he dreamed of improving the lives of his people , of eradicating the misery of poverty and of offering everyone the chance of a better life -- the " good life " ( @entity37 ) , as he called it			2
president @entity5 made those dreams come true			1
during his nearly 14 years of governance , elected to three full six - year terms but only serving two due to his untimely death , @entity5 's policies reduced extreme poverty in @entity46 by more than 75 % , from 25 % to less than 7 % in a decade , according to statistics from the @entity48			1
and overall poverty was reduced by more than 50 % , from 60 % in 1998 when @entity5 first won office to 27 % by 2008			1
what 's next ? @entity5 's death leaves many questions this is not just numbers , this translates into profound changes in the lives of millions of @entity46 who today eat three meals a day , own their homes and have jobs or access to financial aid			1
but the dreams do n't stop there			2
@entity5 dreamed of a nation filled with educated , healthy people , and so he established free , quality public education from preschool through doctoral studies , accessible to all			1
in fact , for those in remote areas or places without educational facilities , schools were built and mobile educational facilities were created to bring education to the people			2
@entity5 also created a national public health system offering universal , free health care to all , with the help and solidarity of @entity87 , which sent thousands of doctors and medical workers to provide quality services to the @entity46 people , many who had never received medical care in their lives			1
to strengthen and empower communities , @entity5 propelled policies of inclusion and participatory governance , giving voice to those previously excluded from politics			1
he created grassroots community councils and networks to attend to local needs in neighborhoods across the nation , placing the power to govern in the joint hands of community groups			2
opinion : @entity5 used force of personality to win votes , influence leaders his vision of diversifying his nation and developing its full potential transformed into railways , new industries , satellite cities and innovative transport , such as @entity122 soaring high into the mountains of @entity124 to connect people in their steep hillside homes with the bustling city			1
the centuries - old dream of @entity130 hero @entity129 to build a unified " @entity132 " ( @entity133 ) in @entity131 became @entity5 's guiding light and he held it high , illuminating the path he paved			1
@entity5 was a driving force in unifying @entity137 , creating new regional organizations like the @entity139 ( @entity139 ) , the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) and the @entity141 ( @entity141 )			1
these entities have embraced integration , cooperation and solidarity as their principal method of exchange , rejecting competition , exploitation and domination , the main principles of @entity153 and western foreign policy			2
@entity5 inspired a 21st century world to fight for justice , to stand with dignity before bullying powers that seek to impose their will on others			1
he raised his voice when no others would and had no fear of consequence , because he knew that truth was on his side			2

he recognized the rights of the disabled , of indigenous peoples , all genders and sexualities			2
he broke down barriers of racism and classism and declared himself a socialist feminist			0
he not only made his own dreams come true , but he inspired us all to achieve our fullest potential			0
do n't get me wrong , things are not perfect in @entity46 by any stretch , but no one can honestly deny that they are much better than before @entity5 became president			1
and no one could deny that president @entity5 was larger than life			1
the first time i flew on president @entity5 's airplane , he invited me to breakfast in his private room			1
it was just me and him			0
i was nervous and felt anxious and rushed to tell him about the results of my investigations into the @entity153 government 's role in the coup d'etat against him in 2002			0
@entity5 leaves a revolutionary legacy after all , that 's why i was on the plane in the first place			1
i had been invited to participate in his regular sunday television show , @entity208 ( hello mr. president ) to present the hundreds of declassified documents i had obtained from @entity153 government agencies through the @entity211 that exposed @entity153 funding of coup participants			0
the date was april 11 , 2004 , exactly two years after the coup that nearly killed him and sent the nation into spiraling chaos			0
( @entity219 's note : the @entity153 government denied involvement in the 2002 coup			0
) as i began pulling out papers and spreading documents on the table that separated us , he stopped me			0
" have you had breakfast yet ? " he asked			0
" no , " i said , and continued fiddling with the revealing paper before me			0
" we can discuss that later , " he said			0
" for now , tell me about yourself			0
how is your mother ? " he asked me , as though we were old friends			0
a flight attendant came through the door of his private room with two trays and placed them on the table			0
i quickly gathered up the documents			0
" let 's eat , " he said			0
i started to protest , trying to explain that his time was so limited i wanted to take advantage of every minute			0
he stopped me and said : " this is a humble breakfast , a breakfast from the barracks , what i most love			0
" i looked at the tray for the first time			0
on it was a small plate with an arepa , a typical @entity46 corn patty , a few shreads of white cheese , a couple of pieces of canteloupe and some anchovies			1
beside the plate was a small cup of black coffee			0
no frills and not what you would expect on a presidential airplane			0
" after all , i am just a soldier , " he added			0
yes , @entity5 , you are a soldier , a glorious soldier of a dignified , proud and kind people			2
and you are a maker of dreams for millions around the world			2
@entity5 leaves @entity46 economy more equal , less stable			1
