tears streamed down 12 - year - old @entity2 's face in 2009 , as he recalled how members of a private suburban @entity5 swim club had hurled racial slurs and worried aloud if he and other mostly minority day campers might steal from them			1
today , @entity2 is just about to turn 15 and hit the gridiron as a running back on his high school football team			2
he has grown up in more ways than one -- including having experienced discrimination firsthand and seen the @entity15 justice system in action , its pursuit of justice driven in large part by his and other adolescents ' accounts of what they had seen and heard that summer			0
" i 'm glad that people saw and felt what i felt , " @entity2 , who is black , told @entity24			2
the @entity27 announced thursday that it and the @entity28 reached a settlement with the now - defunct @entity30 of @entity31 , two and a half years after filing a lawsuit against the club			1
under terms of the deal , the club -- which filed for bankruptcy in november 2009 a few months after the incident and had its property sold for $ 1.46 million the following june -- agreed to payouts to more than 50 children like @entity2 who were part of the @entity43 , their counselors and @entity43			1
the distributed money includes whatever " remaining assets " from the club 's property sale are left over , with $ 65,000 set aside to create a diversity council made up of former @entity30 members , @entity43 counselors , campers and their families to promote community healing , the @entity27 said			1
@entity2 ' mother , @entity55 , who owns @entity43 , told @entity24 on friday that her son grew up in a white neighborhood and goes to school with mostly white students			1
in his first 12 years , she said her son had n't had any problems			0
" this was a culture shock for him , because @entity2 did n't know racism existed , " @entity61 said			1
the day care center based out of northeast @entity5 had paid the @entity30 $ 1,950 in june of 2009 so its camp children could access its pool over the summer			2
but when young day campers came to the predominantly white club for the first time on june 29 , " the children reported hearing racial slurs , " the @entity27 said			1
on july 3 , 2009 , " the club refunded the day camp 's membership fee and prohibited the children from returning to swim " according to the federal agency -- a decision the @entity30 contended then was not due to the campers ' race but because " we underestimated the capacity of our facilities			1
" @entity2 , who was then 12 , told @entity24 soon after the incident that he 'd heard some club members say , " what are these black kids here ? they might steal from us			1
" " it 's kind of sad that people still thinking like this , " the tearful boy said			2
" i thought those days were over			0
" three years later , his mother said she feels that interview had an impact " because ( viewers ) saw a child			0
they did n't see an @entity99 - @entity15 child			0
they saw a child -- before the world -- being discriminated , and he innocently just wanted to take a swim			0
" the recently announced settlement could net each camper between $ 15,000 and $ 30,000 , depending on their involvement in the incident , according to lawyers			1
many of them plan to use the money to help pay for college , the day camp 's civil attorney @entity110 said			2
but not @entity2 , who said he has other plans			2
" i want to open my own business and do something like @entity120 did , " the teenager said			0
@entity61 , his mother , calls the settlement " bittersweet , " though she does feel " justice was served			0
" another civil lawyer involved in the case , @entity126 , said he believes the young campers involved get more than money from the case			0
" it 's a great life lesson for these kids , " @entity126 said			0
" they experienced something terrible and justice prevailed			0
