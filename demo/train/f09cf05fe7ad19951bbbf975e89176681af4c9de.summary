-- the @entity2 born actor @entity1 , who has died aged 81 , led a life that was rich in drama and eccentricity			1
he was nominated for an @entity6 a record eight times and never won			0
the sheer bloodymindedness with which he then rejected an honorary @entity6 in 2003 was characteristic of a man who juggled triumph and disaster with panache			0
@entity1 wrote to the @entity13 : " i am still in the game and might win the lovely bugger outright			1
would the @entity13 please defer the honor until i am 80 ? " he was persuaded to accept only when told that the likes of @entity18 and @entity19 had subsequently won the real thing			0
when receiving the award from @entity22 at the ceremony he quipped : " always the bridesmaid , never a bride my foot ! " it was the same unconventional streak that led to his refusal of a knighthood in 1987 and lent him a dangerous edge , which was also rather glamorous			2
he was a fantastic showman whose versatility was phenomenal			0
read more : ' giant of film and theater ' dies at 81 @entity1 will always be remembered for his brilliant , many - faceted depiction of @entity37 in @entity39 's classic 1962 film " @entity38 , " where he portrayed one of the most extraordinary human beings of the 20th century with amazing skill			1
@entity1 's physical beauty in the role , with his memorably penetrating blue eyes , was remarkable and created an indelible image forever associated with the actor			1
this role was deeply complex as he conveyed @entity37 's courage , vision and genius as well as the more disturbing aspects of his personality , his blood lust , sadomasochism and flamboyance			1
his abilities here were also mirrored elsewhere in a career which reached dizzying heights , fell to desperate lows and which spanned over five decades			0
in uniform @entity37 was comically ill at ease , and it remains ironic that @entity1 's excellent performance as the ramrod stiff guards officer in " @entity68 " was pivotal in @entity39 's choice of him for the role			1
@entity72 's superlatively succinct dialogue in " @entity37 " also contained much humor			0
@entity1 excelled in humorous roles in star vehicles such as " how to steal a million , " or playing a veteran actor who lusts after a friend 's young grandniece in " @entity79 , " his last @entity6 - nominated film			1
his performance as the gentle , much - loved schoolteacher mr @entity82 opposite @entity83 in the musical version of " @entity85 " was a revelation , and he also showed sensitivity as the kindly royal tutor in " @entity89			0
" ' worst shakespeare production of century ' in " @entity38 " the character of @entity37 suffers in an endless search for his identity and @entity1 used his expressive face in this and several other angst - ridden roles with varying effect			1
he was unfairly criticized for his portrayal of the eponymous hero in " @entity100 , " hammed it up somewhat as a psychopathic @entity103 officer in " @entity104 " and , as the tormented @entity105 opposite @entity106 in " @entity107 , " he was extremely moving in a superbly - cast film that received critical acclaim			1
@entity1 also played @entity105 in " @entity110 , " the film adaptation of a lively play about the king 's dysfunctional marital life , which allowed him to carry off a rip - roaring role with zest opposite @entity117			1

@entity1 also possessed a highly distinctive voice which could convey a great variety of moods with seemingly effortless skill			2
he could , however , overact badly			0
in " @entity127 " he played a mad aristocrat in a ridiculous role , though it too was @entity6 nominated , and he was wasted as @entity130 in the dreadful epic " @entity132			0
" playing @entity133 in @entity135 's grotesque " @entity134 " was no career highlight either			0
but he had no shortage of success			0
his @entity6 - nominated roles in " @entity140 " -- where he admitted basing his portrayal of a martinet of a director on his experiences with @entity39 making @entity37 -- and in " @entity145 , " where he played an alcoholic actor past his prime , were very highly regarded			2
along with the others in the first night audience at the @entity151 i roared with shocked laughter at his " @entity153 " in 1980			0
the evening was a bizarre farce which was considered the worst @entity156 production of the century			0
it was on the same stage years later that he triumphed with his wondrously comic portrayal of the loveable but alcohol - soaked @entity161 writer in " @entity163 is @entity164 , " which showed glorious comic timing			2
i particularly remember the roars of mirth when he carried off the celebrated " egg trick			0
" undoubtedly a hellraiser @entity1 had a highly distinguished theatrical career that included a controversial uncut " @entity177 " directed by @entity173 to launch the @entity174 in 1963 and a much praised professor @entity175 in " pygmalion " in 1984			2
he was also undoubtedly a hell - raiser in the same mold as @entity106 and @entity180 and stories about his heavy drinking were legendary			0
debonair in appearance -- with his trademark cigarette holder -- @entity1 had a zest for life that would have been difficult to surpass , a considerable fondness for women , and was also a fine raconteur , as i discovered on meeting him			1
despite advancing age , the standard of most of his performances remained high but undoubtedly had he chosen a more conventional lifestyle his achievements would have been even more substantial			2
but it was in " @entity38 " that @entity1 was at his greatest			1
the film , regarded by many critics as one of the finest ever made , captured the essence of a legend and it was the highlight of the career of @entity1 , a truly wayward genius			1
