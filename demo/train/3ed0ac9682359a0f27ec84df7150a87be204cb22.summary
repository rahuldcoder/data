-- another round of nuclear talks ended late thursday in @entity3			1
nothing good , bad or even surprising has publicly emerged from the two - day talks between @entity6 and the @entity8 countries			1
given the overall trajectory of the nuclear talks in recent months -- to external viewers a dreary process of back and forth , bluster and stalling despite a shared desire to continue talking -- two outcomes appear more or less certain			1
first , the much - anticipated november 24 deadline for a permanent deal will not be met			1
second , the talks will continue and the negotiating teams need to decide whether they need three months , six months -- or any other length of time -- to try to reach a final deal			1
given the high stakes , and the reality that there are no alternative means of moving forward other than continuing talks , all sides are apparently buckling down			0
the head of the @entity6 negotiating team called the @entity3 talks " serious " and " helpful			2
" that was a more uplifting assessment than those that followed the october 15 @entity3 meeting between @entity37 secretary of state @entity36 and @entity6 foreign minister @entity38			0
earlier in the week , an @entity6 foreign ministry spokesperson said that while " 90 % " of the work toward a permanent deal had been completed , " important , sensitive and hard " steps still needed to be tackled			2
in other words , there is still no agreement on two key issues : the scope of @entity6 's enrichment program and how and when to end sanctions on @entity6 as part of a deal			1
on these two key issues , each side has been trying to outmaneuver the other as part of an increasingly public war of words			0
the @entity6 have been particularly quick to react to some reports in the @entity58 that @entity59 can compromise on the scale and timing of the removal of the sanctions			2
earlier , @entity65 news agency claimed that @entity6 officials had informed them that the leadership in @entity59 " would be satisfied with removing crippling @entity37 and @entity69 energy and banking sanctions imposed in 2012 , " which have been the most damaging @entity59 has dismissed that claim , insisting it wants a compromise that would see all sanctions imposed on it lifted -- not just a suspension or partial removal			2
to @entity79 negotiators , this @entity6 stance is a non-starter unless @entity59 is willing to make more compromises on the scale of its enrichment program			2
@entity6 presently has about 19,000 centrifuges , of which 10,000 are estimated to be in operation			0
the @entity58 would like to see the number of operating centrifuges substantially reduced although there is uncertainty about its specific bottom - line on this question			0
by all accounts , the @entity8 states themselves do not appear to have agreed on a target for @entity6 to meet , which means @entity59 has been able to continue maneuvering around the issue			0
the @entity98 and the @entity99 -- the two non-western states in the @entity8 grouping -- are presumably more flexible on that front			0
@entity59 's counter-offer has been to suggest swapping @entity6 's older - generation centrifuges for more advanced ones that produce more enriched uranium at a faster rate			1
however , this is not considered by the @entity58 to amount to a concession by @entity6 , as it ultimately does not reduce the amount of enriched uranium @entity59 will continue to have at its disposal			0
@entity6 's access to enriched uranium has always been at the heart of concerns about its nuclear program			1
in other words , seeking to navigate around these two key stumbling blocks -- the question about the size of @entity6 's enrichment program and a timetable for removal of sanctions -- continues to keep the negotiating parties apart			1
what is also very evident is that neither side wants to walk away from the talks			2
there is no good alternative and not extending the talks beyond november 24 would essentially mean the collapse of a diplomatic formula			1
it is a formula in which both the @entity134 administration in the @entity37 and the government of president @entity136 in @entity6 have invested massively , hoping for a major groundbreaking return			0
as @entity37 @entity141 @entity140 put it this week , the ongoing negotiation " is a puzzle with many interlocking pieces			0
" but after a year of negotiations and eight rounds of meetings , it has become very clear that there are two critical pieces to this puzzle			0
perhaps with more focus and determination , a solution can be reached			0
that is why an extension of the talks beyond november 24 seems to make sense to all parties involved .			1

the latest nuclear talks between @entity6 and the 5 *+1* countries failed to reach a deal
@entity162 says the november 24 deadline for an agreement is unlikely to be met
issues are the size of @entity6 's nuclear program , timetable for sanctions removals , he says
neither side wants to walk away , so the deadline must be extended , @entity162 says
