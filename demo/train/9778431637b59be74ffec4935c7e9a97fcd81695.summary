-- sometimes , it pays to eavesdrop on the next table over at lunch			2
that 's how @entity5 learned about the homeless people living in the woods around his suburban @entity9 community			1
today , some of those men have jobs and homes thanks to @entity15 , in a business collaboration that 's not only producing expertly crafted furniture but restoring hope			1
maybe it 's because feel - good stories are hard to come by that the tale of @entity15 's carpentry outfit , @entity23 , has struck a nerve , earning a standing ovation last week from the audience at @entity27 , a series of independently organized talks modeled after the original @entity31 conference			1
turns out that what they needed were some tools and a chance , @entity5 , 31 , told the audience			1
in return , they 're helping keep alive a tradition of @entity41 craftsmanship that seems to be disappearing with each generation through @entity23 , which is named for @entity15 's grandfather , a farmer and carpenter from @entity9			1
it might not have happened if @entity15 had n't overheard a conversation in 2009 in a restaurant in his hometown of @entity52 , @entity9 , about " the village in the woods			1
" intrigued , he went to see for himself and discovered a makeshift camp where people lived in tents and shared firewood , propane and food that was stored in a hole in the ground			2
some had recently left jail ; others were builders and craftsmen who had fallen on hard times after the housing crisis of 2007 gutted the construction industry			2
photos : ' @entity73 ' @entity5 , a married father of two , wanted to help			1
it had n't been that long since his family had experienced rough financial times after losing their residential development business in the housing crisis			2
he and his wife sold most of their belongings so they could downsize to an apartment and start over			2
the more he got to know the men in the woods and learned about how they 'd landed there , the more he felt he had narrowly avoided a similar fate , he says			1
" i remembered calling and begging mortgage companies to help us out and wondering how we were going to put gas in the car , " he said			0
" i knew how easy it was to fall into that			0
potentially , we 're all just a few steps away from it			0
" watch the @entity27 talk he began making regular visits to the camp with loads of firewood , propane and other supplies to be divvied up among the residents			0
but his donations did n't seem to do much to improve the long - term prospects of the men who lived there , @entity5 said			1
frustrated that he was enabling their destitution , he asked how he could help			0
the answer was simple , one man said : they needed jobs			0
they had no addresses , no cell phones and no licenses			0
" ' no one will hire us , ' " @entity15 's friend , @entity120 , told him			0
it did n't take long for @entity15 to figure out how he could help in a way that would change his fortune as well			0
by this time , @entity5 had a " safe " job as creative director of a @entity130 church designing graphics and doing photography , he said			1
but he was a craftsman at heart and felt a piece of himself was missing			0
if a story was ever written about @entity5 's life at that point , " no one would want to read it , " he said			1
with the help of his wife and her addiction to @entity143 , the online pinboard for sharing decor and design inspiration , he 'd returned to carpentry on the weekends , he told the audience			0
he began selling his work on @entity149 and demand grew steadily to the point where @entity5 wondered how he could transform his weekend hobby into a full - time job			1
then , it hit him			0
on january 1 , he picked up @entity155 , who goes by " @entity156 , " from the camp and brought him to a workshop to see whether his carpentry chops were up to snuff after years of wandering around @entity161 and @entity9 homeless			1
@entity5 was pleasantly surprised by what he saw and eventually hired two more men from the camp and another who was living in a trailer			1
finally , @entity15 was seeing the change he 'd hoped for			0
soon , @entity155 had saved up enough money to move out of the woods and into a group home , where he does n't have to worry about the weather , leaky tents or where his next meal will come from , the 52 - year - old carpenter said			1
" i 'm grateful for being able to meet new people and associate with people instead of hiding from them , " said @entity155 , who lived in the woods for eight months before moving out in the spring			1
" it 's great being able to buy the things that i need , go places i wan na go to and i just enjoy working with my hands again			2
" @entity183 , who was the de facto leader of the camp , had earned enough money to move into a group home after just one month working for @entity15			1
" now , i 'm able to provide for myself , " @entity183 , 30 , said in an interview before @entity27			2
" i felt like i was the lowest person on the totem pole			0
it 's really brought my self - esteem way up in life since i 've come out of these woods			1
" @entity15 's four employees are keeping busy at work and outside the shop as they rebuild their lives			0
none of them lives in the woods and one who was an absentee father is rekindling a relationship with his daughter			2
@entity15 is also seeing bottom line results with orders from clients including @entity205 and smaller custom orders			0
while he 's proud of their work , he believes a lot of the interest comes from @entity23 's story , as both the continuation of his grandfather 's legacy and the start of a new one for his employees -- homeless or not			2
" we like to say , provide hope for the craftsman , not necessarily guys who are homeless			0
it 's more about giving work to out - of - work craftsman who were created to build , " he said			2
" we give them hope , " he told the @entity224 audience			0
" if we put these folks back to work we could save entire communities			0

@entity23 employs carpenters and builders who lost their livelihoods
@entity5 hired men who live in the woods of suburban @entity9
after a few months working , some had saved enough to move into homes
@entity183 says his self - esteem has risen " since i 've come out of these woods "
