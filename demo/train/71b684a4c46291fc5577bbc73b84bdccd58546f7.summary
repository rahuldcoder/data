" " when our leadership discovered the overwhelming concern that some of @entity6 's affiliates were giving funds to @entity10 , we began the arduous process of withdrawing this @entity3 from the market , " stated a release by @entity27 , president and ceo of @entity2			1
" though we have assurances that @entity6 's funds are used only for breast cancer screening and awareness , it is not in keeping with @entity2 's core values to have even an indirect relationship with @entity10			1
