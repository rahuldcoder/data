-- the @entity3 militia fighters working hand in hand with @entity7 's military to repress the 15 - month - long uprising are president @entity10 's " shock troops , " observers say			1
" the regime uses them for the real dirty work , killing and violent action , especially where it has to go into an urban area and repress resistance , " said @entity11 , defense fellow at the @entity12			2
civil war imminent in @entity7 , @entity20 warns blamed for their participation in the @entity26 and @entity27 massacres and other assaults , there may be tens of thousands of them , mostly but not all members of the @entity31 sect that dominates the government , analysts say			2
@entity20 observers come under fire the @entity3 emerged in the 1970s as @entity31 gangsters from the coastal region with ties to the @entity38			1
they were involved in drug - and weapons - smuggling from @entity41 , where they moved those and more benign products from the more robust economy next door into the closed @entity7 society			1
the name @entity3 is thought to be taken from the @entity50 word for " ghost			1
" photos : in @entity7 , families flee and rebels fight one @entity7 writer , @entity55 , says it refers to people operating " outside the law and living in the shadows			2
" he and others also think it might be taken from " shabah , " the name of a @entity65 model that @entity3 members drove			1
after the uprising started last year , the @entity3 were enlisted as regime fighters , and the meaning of the term is widely regarded as " thug			1
" the name fits , said @entity73 , a @entity7 expert at the @entity75 - based @entity74			2
they used to smuggle drugs and weapons , @entity73 said , but " now they are being used as butchers			1
" @entity73 said the government has been blaming the violence across @entity7 on anti-regime forces			2
but he said the @entity3 , in fact , " are the armed gangs " terrorizing the populace			1
sometimes @entity3 wear fatigue pants and t - shirts and have been seen on army tanks			1
they drive around in white pickups brandishing weapons , @entity73 said , and they look like " muscleheads with bulging physiques			2
" many have shaved heads and sport thick black beards			2
@entity7 : how a year of horror unfolded the beards are a confusing touch , @entity73 said , because they " want to look like @entity100 " so people will think they are the fundamentalist @entity102 they dislike and blame for violence			2
@entity3 have broken up demonstrations and harassed diplomats , said @entity107 , @entity7 expert for the @entity12			1
he also said people have come under international sanctions for directing @entity3 activities			1
opinion : the only glimmer of hope for @entity7 calling them the " black market " version of the @entity7 security forces , @entity73 said they spy for the regime and keep weapons away from resistance fighters by purchasing as many as they can on the black market			1
@entity73 said they also plunder property , gang rape and engage in summary executions			2
" @entity26 was the global recognition of what they 'd been up to , " he said			0
the regime uses @entity3 for " plausible deniability , " @entity73 said			1
for example , the government can say the military was n't involved in house - to - house raids actually conducted by @entity7 security forces			2
massacre in @entity7 town feels eerily familiar analysts say the @entity3 also operate in other parts of the country , such as @entity143 in the east			1
@entity73 said there are reports of other pro-government proxies , such as @entity149 militants , @entity151 militants from @entity41 and @entity152 , and @entity154 forces			2
the @entity31 region is largely along the coast , with @entity157 at its center			0
@entity159 , director of the @entity160 and associate professor of @entity163 studies at the @entity164 , said @entity31 live " cheek by jowl " near @entity102 in @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity169 province in the west			0
he describes that as a " poor band of countryside " that 's the " center of the revolution			0
" " not good fences , " he said			0
in a recent essay , @entity159 wrote that " since the start of the uprising , many @entity7 tribesmen have supported the state 's security apparatus , controlled by the @entity38			0
this is not a new practice , and @entity7 tribes have been used as enforcers for the @entity7 government for decades			0
in many restive regions of @entity7 , tribesmen are deployed by the @entity7 military as paramilitary forces called @entity3			1
" he wrote they have also been referred to as " jahaaz , which means ' apparatus , ' as in a security apparatus , but has the connotation of ' political tools			0
' " @entity159 notes that in the 1970s , the " feared " @entity3 also played an important role in providing @entity7 ' goods , from mayonnaise to toothpaste			1
" they became this super-regime dedicated element , whose livelihood and future were dependent on the regime , " @entity159 said			0
when the troubles started , the regime turned to its indigenous muscle for help , mobilized their networks and " turned them into special forces and shock troops			1
" " this was necessary because the multi-ethnic army became undependable , " @entity159 said of the huge army with a strong @entity102 presence			0
" they are defecting and do n't want to shoot			0
they wo n't shoot at other @entity102			0
" @entity220 , @entity221 call for non-intervention as a result , the regime cycled in " tons of shabiha who are going to do the heavy lifting , " and tit - for - tat sectarian blood vendettas have unfolded			0
he said the recent massacres indicate that the @entity3 are gaining power and influence while the regime is " flailing around " and " losing control of the @entity7 army			1
" " irregular or special forces are increasingly calling the shots , " he said			1
@entity159 likened the situation to @entity152 , where minority sunnis who prevailed during the @entity242 regime lost their clout after a populace dominated by @entity151 and @entity149 took power			0
some @entity3 might hail from other communities , such as the @entity102 or @entity246			1
but the mostly @entity31 membership join up for money and because they believe they will be persecuted by a @entity102 - dominated opposition if @entity10 's regime is toppled , analysts say			0
the @entity31 , who dominate state ministries and have more jobs than other ethnic groups , are clinging to the top and know they will face a " bleak future			0
" " all the incentives are to back the regime			0
they got their backs against the wall			0
there 's going to be hell to pay when they lose power , " @entity159 said			0
for now , @entity11 said , the resistance has learned to spot the pro-regime fighters			0
the @entity269 opposition fighters have been attacking the @entity3 and getting their weapons			1
" it looks like the @entity269 has a lot more guns , " he said			0
" i 'm not seeing a lot of reports of them running low			0

the @entity3 emerged in the ' 70s as a *criminal* gang
the word might be derived from the name of a @entity65
special forces like the @entity3 are gaining in influence , an analyst says
they used to smuggle drugs and weapons , but " now they are being used as butchers "
