-- for most of his life he 's been @entity3 , the nimble - voiced frontman of one of rock 's great genre - hoppers -- but @entity3 is finally ready to put his alter - ego to bed			1
" it 's time to move on , " @entity3 told @entity0 from his home in @entity11			1
" i 'm retiring @entity3			1
" so does that mean the end for @entity3 , the band that @entity3 formed with high school friend @entity16 ( a.k.a. @entity16 ) in @entity18 , @entity19 , in the mid-eighties ? " pretty much , yeah , " says @entity3			1
" it 's been a long time , 25 years			2
it was a good run			0
" @entity3 , who released his solo debut " @entity24 " earlier this month , says there 's no animosity towards his bandmates or @entity16 , who he met in the eighth grade			1
he says the pair are still on speaking terms , even though he 's been contemplating the decision for the past eight years			1
" for me it 's a closed book			0
in life sometimes , in the universe , you have to close some doors to have others open , " says @entity3			2
" there 's no , ' godd * * n that such and such ! ' for me , i 'd like to think it 's a door i can close finally			0
" @entity3 and @entity16 released a slew of home - recorded tapes in the @entity43 before they tasted unlikely @entity46 success in 1992 with " @entity47 , " from their major - label debut " @entity50			1
" after that novelty single , @entity3 went on to release albums that reflected their intense love of music , from metal to @entity57 and all points in between			2
on 1996 's " @entity60 , " they brought in @entity62 session players for an album of country originals , while saxophonist @entity65 guested on " @entity66 , " from @entity3 's most recent album , 2007 's " @entity68			1
" but question marks over @entity3 's future were raised following an onstage meltdown by @entity3 at a show in @entity73 last year			1
the singer spent several weeks in an @entity76 rehab facility battling substance abuse issues			0
back at home and in good spirits , he says that his solo debut helped him get back on track			1
" it 's a nice recovery record , definitely , " he says			0
like most of @entity3 's oeuvre , " @entity24 " is another unexpected detour : a covers album of tunes by the reclusive @entity88 songwriter @entity87			1
in his heyday , @entity87 was penning songs for the likes of @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , but he 's become somewhat of an obscure figure since he retired from the stage in the early - @entity43			0
" i was struck by the simplicity and power of songs , " says @entity3 , who came to @entity87 through " @entity60 " producer @entity97			2
" anybody that can accomplish that kind of thing is great			0
" @entity3 recently spent an afternoon with the 79 - year - old singer in his @entity107 home			2
" he 's got this incredible studio downstairs in his house -- it has n't been touched since 1973			0
he 's got a room full of master tapes ... he 's got probably thousands of songs that have n't seen the light of day			0
" so is another volume of @entity87 covers on the cards ? " i could make five more @entity87 records , but that could get a little weird , " jokes @entity3 , who plans on releasing an album of original material next			2
" it 's important to know that this is n't a side project			0
i 'm forging a new thing for myself			0
there 's no plans for any records or touring for @entity3 from my end			1
