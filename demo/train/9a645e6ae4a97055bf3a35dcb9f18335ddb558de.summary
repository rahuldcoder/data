pope @entity0 has unleashed a blistering critique of the @entity3 bureaucracy -- or @entity4 -- criticizing its " illnesses " ranging from the " disease of feeling immortal " to vainglory and excessive planning			1
in his annual @entity11 address to the @entity4 at the @entity3 monday , the @entity9 warned that " a church that does n't try to improve is like a sick body			1
" @entity0 said suggested that it would be helpful to the @entity3 bureaucrats to have a catalog of their illnesses beginning with " this disease of feeling immortal or indispensable			1
" the " pathology of power , " he said , could lead to people believing " they are superior to others and not here for the service to others			0
" @entity0 warned against the disease of loss of compassion , which he said afflicted " those who have a heart of stone			1
" " those who lose their inner serenity , their vivacity and audacity , to hide behind their papers , becoming like procedural machines rather than men of @entity40			0
this is dangerous to lose human sensitivity , so necessary in order to cry with those who cry and enjoy with those who enjoy , " the @entity0 said			2
pope @entity0 referred to the diseases of " excessive planning and functionalism " and of " bad coordination , " which he said could occur when members did not collaborate with each other			1
there was also the risk of succumbing to spiritual alzheimer 's disease and " forgetting the story of salvation , " he said , warning that sufferers " lost memory of their encounter with @entity40			0
" the @entity0 described the diseases of rivalry and vainglory , and rebuked those who try to court their superiors " inspired by their own egotism			1
" the disease of gossip , @entity0 said , he had addressed before -- but insufficiently			1
" this is a serious disease that begins simply when people chatter , and it takes over the person , turning the person as a @entity77 , and in so many cases people are speaking ill about their own colleagues and brothers and sisters			0
these people have n't got the courage to speak directly , and they speak about others behind their backs , " he said			0
" dear brothers , let us be aware and guard against the terrorism of gossip			2
" pope @entity0 also appeared to speak to the child abuse scandal that has rocked the @entity90 , referring to it as the " disease of a closeness			1
" " this disease also begins from good intentions , but with the passing of time enslaves its members , becoming a cancer which threatens the harmony of the body and causes a lot of evil and scandal , especially towards our small brothers and sisters , " @entity0 said			2
finally , @entity0 warned against the disease of the mundane -- " of the exhibitionism when the apostle transforms his service in power			1
" " this is a disease of people who seek tirelessly to multiply power only aimed at calumny , and to defame and discredit others , " he said			0
pope @entity0 concluded : " dear brothers , such diseases and such temptations are a naturally a danger for each @entity124 and for each @entity4			1
for each community , for any ecclesiastical movement			0
they can damage both individually and the community			0
we have to say that only the @entity131 and the soul of @entity133 , only he can protect us from the disease			0
" we have to cure ourselves of these			0
let us try to grow together and close to @entity133			0
" in an interview with @entity139 's @entity138 that aired earlier this month , veteran @entity3 watcher @entity136 said @entity0 had been encountering growing opposition within his own church			1
this was mainly due to @entity0 ' efforts at reform since becoming @entity0 in march 2013 , @entity136 said			2
" within the @entity90 , there is a tough group of conservative bishops and priests and cardinals , and also very traditionalist bishops and cardinals who are practically against the @entity0 , who are working against the @entity0 , " he said			2
" they do n't like what he wanted to do with the synod about family , to give new possibilities to remarried and divorced people to get the communion , or to have a new look on the homosexual union			0
