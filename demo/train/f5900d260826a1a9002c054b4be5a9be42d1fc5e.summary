@entity1 , @entity0 -- a former motor - racing engineer has unveiled a prototype of a new hydrogen - powered city car which claims to emit less than one third of the carbon emissions produced by its nearest rival			1
the @entity11 has been nine years in the making and needs further funding for city trials			2
the creators of the ' @entity16 , ' @entity17 - based company @entity11 , say the vehicle emits less than 30 grams per kilometer of carbon dioxide , less than one third of the carbon produced by the @entity22			1
@entity11 founder @entity23 has spent nine years researching and developing the prototype car			1
" i think that the auto industry is focusing a lot of money on research and development at a basic science level on hydrogen storage and fuel cell technology			1
we do n't think it 's necessary to do that , " @entity23 told @entity2			2
" we can use existing technology and integrate it into a whole system design approach -- that is where the breakthrough has come			0
" @entity40 is searching for extra funding to put the ' @entity16 ' on the streets , but he says at this stage they wo n't be for sale			0
@entity11 plans to lease the car to customers for a monthly fee of £ 200 ( $ 330 )			1
hydrogen fuel for the cars will cost just 15 pence ( 25 cents ) per mile			1
it 's a long way from the fuel - guzzling world @entity23 used to inhabit as a designer and developer of high - powered racing cars			1
it was the industry 's appalling environmental record that encouraged him to leave to try to find a way to make driving greener			2
" certainly the first five or six years were hard work because i did have an awful lot of people telling me i was mad , " @entity23 told @entity2 , at the launch of the @entity11 in @entity1			2
" gradually it all sort of gathered steam , " he said , adding " i 'm absolutely convinced that we 're offering a better solution for a segment of the transport problem and we 'd be crazy not to pursue it			0
" the @entity16 's power comes from hydrogen fuel cells which are linked to four electric motors situated over each of the car 's wheels			1
almost all of the braking is done by the electric motors , which then capture the energy of the car in motion and store it in a bank of ultracapacitors			1
in conventional cars , the energy generated through braking is lost as heat			0
the energy stored in the @entity16 's electric motors is enough to power 80 percent of the car 's acceleration			1
that reduces the energy demands on the hydrogen fuel cell , meaning it can be one fifth of the size of one used in a normal car			1
the lighter fuel cell also makes it more energy efficient			1
a large part of the funding for the car 's development came from the family of @entity109 , the eldest grandson of @entity110 who founded the motor company of the same name in 1931			2
@entity110 's great - grandson @entity113 is a partner in @entity114			0
he says the company 's nimble size has given it an advantage over larger car manufacturers whose future he says concerns him			1
" it concerns me massively , because i do n't see that the model they have now is very relevant to where consumers are going			0
consumers are looking for a different solution			0
i 'm not sure if what they 're producing is working , " he said			0
@entity11 plans to share the designs for its car through open - source licence agreements , a system more commonly used in the software industry			2
designers and manufacturers will be invited to make improvements so the car evolves into the most efficient vehicle it can be			0
" we do n't believe that making money on @entity142 ( intellectual property ) is really what 's actually happening even now			0
we believe that service and providing the solution for customers will be where we make money , " @entity109 told @entity2			0
the next step now is to find further financing , another £ 20 million ( $ 33 million ) , to build and test ten cars			1
fifty prototypes will then be built for a pilot project in a small city			0
the location is still to be confirmed , but @entity11 has narrowed down its options to small towns in the @entity17 , perhaps @entity160 or @entity161			2
" i 'm very confident we 'll get it to market , " @entity23 said			0
" i could n't say hand on heart that i 'm confident that we 'll achieve what i think technically can be done			0
that 's a bit in the lap of the gods and it 's all to do with people , politics and business -- all a bit more unpredictable			0

@entity11 launches car prototype with lowest level of carbon emissions
car is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell and four electric motors over the wheels
company 's looking for $ 33 million *dollars* to build ten cars for trials
@entity190 used *expertise* he gained in motor racing to build prototype
