-- tensions simmered in @entity2 as a political stalemate continued friday after the state 's @entity4 passed a @entity7 bill that would strip most state workers of the bulk of their collective - bargaining rights			1
among other things , the measure would require workers -- with the exception of police and firefighters -- to cover more of their health care premiums and pension contributions			0
collective bargaining would be limited to wages , though any pay increases beyond the inflation rate would be subject to voter approval			1
democrats chanted " shame , shame , shame " moments after the vote , pointing their fingers at the exiting @entity7 lawmakers			1
but the fight over the bill appears far from over			2
it still must clear the @entity32 , a step that is likely to prove far more contentious			0
fourteen @entity24 senators have fled to neighboring @entity35 to prevent a quorum from voting on the issue , and they remained absent early friday			1
gov. @entity38 reiterated his call for @entity24 to return to the @entity40 , defending the bill			1
" collective bargaining is a fiscal matter , " said @entity38 , who toured multiple state districts friday in an effort to pressure the absentee lawmakers			1
but @entity24 said the governor 's proposal is tantamount to union - busting			1
" the vote we took was n't the easy thing to do , but it was the right thing to do , " assembly majority leader @entity50 , a @entity7 , said early friday			2
" i continue to urge my @entity55 colleagues in the @entity32 to come back to @entity56 so that they can debate this bill and do their job for the taxpayers of @entity2			2
" thousands have protested the legislation in recent days			1
on thursday , @entity38 also called on @entity24 to come back to @entity56 " and do their job			2
" the absence of the @entity24 prevents a quorum from voting on the bill			1
" it is a serious breach , " said @entity66 law professor @entity65			0
" we 're looking at a set of novel and unprecedented actions			0
but a breakdown of the democratic process and mayhem are two different things			0
" if the @entity24 are " willing to go to the mattresses on this , then it has got to be worth a lot of money , " he said			2
at a thursday night news conference , @entity38 said if the @entity40 does not pass his budget bill , state aid to local governments could be cut , brushing off critics who said the legislation will destroy public employee unions in the state			1
" @entity2 state employees have the strongest civil protections in the country			0
that 's not going to change in this bill , " @entity38 said			0
" it 's not about the union boss coming in from other parts of the country			0
it 's about whether we protect the taxpayers and the workers			0
" one lawmaker who left the state , senate minority leader @entity105 , said in a response from @entity107 , @entity35 , that @entity38 should " recognize that he got what he wants " in concessions on pension and health insurance contributions and relent on curbing collective - bargaining rights			1
the confrontation reached a fever pitch after @entity38 was recorded during a prank phone call discussing the idea of duping absentee democrats by luring them back to " talk , not negotiate , " allow them to recess and then have the 19 @entity7 senators declare a quorum			2
the @entity7 - led @entity32 presumably then would be able to move forward on the controversial legislation			1
the state had faced a suggested deadline friday to balance the budget			0
the crucial date is march 16 , state officials said			0
@entity2 is confronted with a $ 137 million budget shortfall by june 30 and a $ 3.6 billion gap by 2013			0
@entity0 's @entity131 contributed to this report .			0
