@entity0 -- civil rights lawyers filed papers in federal court monday seeking to prohibit the @entity6 's surveillance of @entity8 communities when there is no evidence that they are linked to terrorism or other illegal activities			1
the department 's demographics unit -- or zone assessment unit -- was put together with the @entity17 's help after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
the unit has acknowledged that it engaged in monitoring that included @entity8 - owned business and mosques across the @entity0 region			1
the motion filed monday is part of a class - action case from 1971 that resulted in a historic settlement in 1985 known as the @entity29 agreement , or @entity29 guidelines			2
the settlement restricted police -- who were then accused of compiling dossiers on political activists and those perceived as radicals -- from investigating individuals whose activities were constitutionally protected			2
" we think the surveillance of innocent @entity8 is an infringement of civil liberties by the police and a violation of the guidelines , " said @entity39 , a @entity40 law professor and one of five attorneys on the @entity29 case			1
@entity8 leaders boycott breakfast over surveillance program according to the guidelines , the police can not keep records unless they find evidence of terrorism , and according to @entity39 , they have kept voluminous records on businesses connected with @entity57			1
" there 's no indication of crime in connection with any of the organizations they 've infiltrated , " @entity39 said			0
last summer the head of the city 's police intelligence division testified that the controversial surveillance unit never produced a lead that linked to a potential terrorist plot during years of investigation			2
the unit 's reports never led to a terrorism investigation in at least six years of surveillance , according to court testimony from @entity76 , the commanding officer of the police intelligence division			1
" i could tell you that i have never made a lead from rhetoric that came from a demographics report , and i 'm here since 2006 , " he said in a june 28 deposition unsealed last august			0
" i do n't recall other ones prior to my arrival			0
again , that 's always a possibility			0
i am not aware of any			0
" a 60 - page report obtained by @entity89 in 2012 showed police department maps of @entity91 , @entity92 , and photographs of @entity8 residences and mosques , while other reports revealed that authorities had tracked websites and on at least one occasion placed an undercover officer among university students			1
there was no statement in the documents regarding terrorism or other criminal activity			0
however , in 2011 civil rights attorneys filed papers in federal court challenging whether the use of undercover agents and informants within @entity8 communities constituted a breach of those guidelines			1
last year @entity6 deputy commissioner @entity116 said that the " premise that the demographic unit was used for wholesale spying on @entity8 , using undercover officers and informants to do so , was false , " and that neither " confidential informants nor undercover officers were assigned to the demographics unit			2
" @entity124 added that " the small unit , about eight people , surveyed places a terrorist might go to use a foreign language internet cafe , get a job off the books , find a place to stay , etc. " however , police did uncover information that " led them to recommend that investigators take a closer look			2
" police actions adhered to the @entity139 guidelines , @entity124 added , which were modified after the 2001 attacks to provide authorities greater leeway in investigating potential threats			2
in the first expansive official description of the city 's demographics unit , @entity76 testified last june that the department had collected information often based on ethnicity and language			0
" @entity152 speakers from that region ( @entity154 ) would be of concern , so that 's why it 's important to me , " he said			0
listening in on a conversation at a @entity161 cafe could also be useful , he added , allowing analysts to determine what part of @entity161 the cafe - goers were from			0
" that may be an indicator of possibility that that is a sympathizer to @entity168 because southern @entity161 is dominated by @entity168			0
" but " related to demographics ... i can tell you that information that ( has ) come in has not commenced an investigation			0
" the purpose of the unit is to help " identify locations if we 're faced with a threat , " he noted , offering investigators a better starting point when confronted with a possible attack			0
" the police department needs to know where we should go and look for that particular terrorist , " he said			1
" a lot of information that the zone assessment unit captures helps us identify locations that we should look or not look for			0
" last year @entity92 attorney general @entity191 announced that the @entity6 did not violate @entity92 laws when it carried out surveillance of @entity8 - run businesses across state lines			1
the findings were the product of a three - month review meant to address concerns expressed by @entity8 organizations , who later filed a lawsuit in @entity92 federal court against the @entity6 for unfairly targeting the @entity8 community			1
@entity206 attorney general @entity205 in march called reports of @entity6 surveillance " disturbing , " though @entity210 chief counterterrorism adviser @entity209 praised the city 's efforts to strike a balance between security and the protection of civil rights .			1

civil rights lawyers ask federal court to end @entity0 police surveillance of @entity8
surveillance of businesses , mosques violate 1985 court settlement on monitoring groups , lawyers say
police department unit monitored @entity8 businesses and mosques in region
power to monitor groups expanded after 9/11 attacks in 2001
