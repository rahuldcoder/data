@entity1 lawmakers on tuesday voted in favor of a law that sets the stage for the @entity6 to be the first country in the world to allow a pioneering in vitro fertilization technique using dna from three people			1
the technique could prevent mitochondrial diseases but also raises significant ethical issues			2
the measure was passed in the @entity18 , 382 to 128 , speaker @entity16 said			2
a further vote must be held in the @entity6 's upper house , the @entity21 , before the measure can become law			1
passage of the law is opposed by @entity27 and @entity28 church leaders , in part because the process involves the destruction of an embryo			2
one in 6,500 babies in the @entity6 are thought to develop a serious mitochondrial disorder , which can lead to health issues such as heart and liver disease , respiratory problems , blindness and muscular dystrophy			1
problems with mitochondria , the " powerhouse " cells of the body , are inherited from the mother , so the proposed ivf treatment would mean an affected woman could have a baby without passing on mitochondrial disease			0
but the cutting - edge @entity52 technique , which involves transferring nuclear genetic material from a mother 's egg or embryo into a donor egg or embryo that 's had its nuclear dna removed , raises ethical questions			1
the new embryo will contain nuclear dna from the intended father and mother , as well as healthy mitochondrial dna from the donor embryo -- effectively creating a " three - parent " baby			2
the amount of donor dna in the mitochondria will , however , be much less than the parental dna in the nucleus , which determines the baby 's characteristics			1
the @entity28 's national adviser on medical issues , the rev. dr. @entity76 , described the step as representing an ethical watershed and said more research and wider debate were needed			0
" we accept in certain circumstances that embryo research is permissible as long as it is undertaken to alleviate human suffering and embryos are treated with respect			0
we have great sympathy for families affected by mitochondrial disease and are not opposed in principle to mitochondrial replacement , " he said			0
" our view , however , remains that we believe that the law should not be changed until there has been further scientific study and informed debate into the ethics , safety and efficacy of mitochondrial replacement therapy			0
" bishop @entity102 , in a statement posted online by the @entity104 , urged lawmakers not to rush into taking such a serious step			0
" it seems extraordinary that a licence should be sought for a radical new technique affecting future generations without first conducting a clinical trial , " he said			0
" there are also serious ethical objections to this procedure which involves the destruction of human embryos as part of the process			0
" the @entity120 - based @entity119 , in an open letter to @entity6 lawmakers last month , said that although the proposed goal was noble , " the techniques will in fact put women and children at risk for severe complications , divert resources from promising alternatives and treatments , and set a policy precedent that experimentation on future generations is an acceptable biomedical / fertility development			1
" a team at the @entity138 , led by professor @entity139 and based at @entity140 in northern @entity141 , has been leading the research into the pioneering @entity52 technique			1
the center points out that mitochondrial diseases can not be cured and that in many families , several people are affected			0
a @entity138 fact sheet states that " nuclear dna is not altered , and so mitochondrial donation will not affect the child 's appearance , personality or any other features that make a person unique -- it will simply allow the mitochondria to function normally and the child to be free of mitochondrial dna disease			1
" the healthy mitochondria will also be passed on to any children of women born using the technique			1
" according to the latest estimates from the research team , published in @entity165 , almost 2,500 women of childbearing age in the @entity6 are at risk of transmitting mitochondrial disease to their children , while in the @entity172 , the number is more than 12,400			1
this equates to an average of 152 births per year in the @entity6 , and 778 births per year in the @entity172 , the team said			2
in a @entity140 news release , @entity139 said his team 's findings had considerable implications for other countries considering the technique			2
allowing it would give " women who carry these mutations greater reproductive choice , " he said			0
@entity2 's @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 contributed to this report .			0

@entity6 lawmakers vote *overwhelmingly* in favor of allowing the new @entity52 technique
a further vote must be held in the @entity21 before the measure can become law
scientists say the technique will not change a child 's characteristics , just make it healthy
