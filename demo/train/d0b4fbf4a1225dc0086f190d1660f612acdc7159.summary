-- if @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 are arguably the greatest proponents of their respective sports , @entity1 made a compelling case for joining that pantheon of greats after securing a record - equaling seventh @entity14 title on sunday			1
at the age of 30 , considered a grand old age in tennis , he came from behind to leave @entity18 -- an opponent five years his junior -- shattered and tearful after a gripping three and a half hours on @entity20			2
it ended @entity1 's two - and - a - half - year wait for a record - extending 17th grand slam title , and equaled his hero @entity23 ' seven successes at the @entity25			1
" i believe @entity1 is the best player to have ever played the game , " @entity27 tennis coach @entity26 told @entity0			1
" when you look at groundstrokes and all parts of the game , there is not a weakness in @entity40 's technique , movement and recovery , " added @entity26 , referring to @entity31 's @entity30 champion -- who @entity1 beat in friday 's semifinals			2
" but when you come down to who is the best player that can change , that can anticipate and come forward and do anything , then my vote goes to @entity1			0
" @entity1 's latest victory ensured his return to the top of the world rankings , ending @entity40 's 12 - month reign , as well as matching @entity23 ' record of 286 weeks at no. 1			1
the @entity55 is only the second player in the men 's game to have held the top ranking over the age of 30 , alongside @entity61 , who was one of the many leading players to attend @entity26 's academy in @entity64			2
" i believe @entity1 thinks in his mind he can win anything , " said @entity26 , who also helped develop grand slam champions such as @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity68			1
" with his game he can play for another two , three or four years and i sincerely believe he 's another two , three or four grand slam titles in him			1
" much has been made of the impact @entity74 has had on @entity18 since becoming his coach in december 2011 , but @entity26 suggested @entity76 , who began working with @entity1 in august 2010 , also deserves credit for persuading the four - time @entity78 to adopt a more aggressive approach			1
" @entity76 wo n't give too much advice to @entity1 , a little bit here and a little bit there , " said the 80 - year - old			2
" he has him coming in and he has him much looser on that backhand			0
" @entity87 has got him hitting the backhand very aggressively and there is a lot of rackethead exploration rather than just blocking the ball			0
" @entity1 's footwork is meticulous --- it reminds me of @entity2			2
on sunday he went around the ball a lot and when you do that you give up a lot of court space , so your success depends on your balance when hitting that shot as that is what operates the face of the racket			0
" while labeling @entity1 as " beyond description , " @entity26 stressed that @entity18 's gritty performance in the @entity14 final bodes well for the future			1
" even though he lost , there will be an inner feeling he gave it his all , " said @entity26 , reflecting on the @entity113 's fourth successive grand slam final defeat -- three of them against @entity1			1
" @entity74 has brought tremendous focus and a few simple tips on strategy , but he has n't messed with his technique and all that crap			0
@entity18 's movement and anticipation is as good as anyone 's in the game			2
" however if @entity18 is to win a grand slam , @entity26 pointed to the hard - court surfaces of either the @entity27 or @entity131 as his best opportunity to break his duck			1
" i do n't believe grass or clay is the best surface for him			0
he is so good , but if the bounce is even he can stand closer to the baseline , he can hit aggressive and he can come in			0
" @entity141 tennis coach @entity140 , who has also worked with @entity26 , is equally encouraging about @entity18 's future			1
" the best is yet come for @entity18 , he is just entering the third phase of his career -- where he has the physical strength and emotional maturity , as well as the technical skills and experience , " said @entity140 , who has worked extensively with stars such as @entity144 and @entity145			2
" with the @entity153 team around him and @entity74 's wisdom , @entity18 is well positioned to make more grand slam finals in the future			1
the previous two finals were premature for @entity18 ; the sport was ready , but he was not			0
" he is more mature emotionally			0
there are less outbursts and lapses in concentration			0
his game from outward appearances is the same , but his mind and emotions are not			0
" as a result he is playing with more structure and patterns , using his strengths more often , whereas in the past he would rely on a wider array of shot against his opponents			0
" @entity140 , who frequently travels to @entity153 to run coaching workshops , also argues that @entity18 's achievement in reaching the @entity14 final will have a spinoff for grassroots tennis in the @entity153			1
" @entity153 tennis will benefit immensely			0
it validates the pathway and what 's possible for thousands of aspiring tennis players , and will be indelibly etched in their mind for years to come : ' if he can do it , so can i. ' "			0

@entity1 's win over @entity18 equals @entity23 ' seven - title @entity14 record
the @entity55 has won 17 grand slam titles -- the most in tennis *history* -- with @entity23 next on 14
@entity27 tennis coach @entity26 believes @entity1 could still win as many as four more grand slams
he says @entity18 's best chance of winning a grand slam is at the @entity27 or @entity141 opens
