a lawyer for @entity1 called the increasing number of claims of sexual assault against the legendary comedian " ridiculous " and said the media should stop airing " unsubstantiated , fantastical stories			1
" @entity8 said in a written statement sent to @entity10 that it defies common sense that " so many people would have said nothing , done nothing , and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years			0
" @entity1 , 77 , has not faced a judge or jury , let alone been convicted , regarding any accusations			1
at least 10 women now have raised allegations against him			2
on friday , @entity1 told @entity25 he was n't going to respond to " innuendos , " referring to the women 's accusations			1
" i know people are tired of me not saying anything , but a guy does n't have to answer to innuendos			1
people should fact - check			0
people should n't have to go through that and should n't answer to innuendos , " @entity1 told the newspaper in a backstage interview before his sellout performance at the @entity36 in @entity37			1
his show began to a standing ovation , and he did n't mention the allegation during his 90 - minute act , the newspaper said			2
stories of @entity1 's purported misdeeds have been around for about a decade , but they recently got new life when another comedian took aim at him			1
@entity8 said there are plenty of attorneys who are ready to help victims file lawsuits against rich , powerful men			0
he blamed the media for the rise in the number of women who recently have alleged @entity1 assaulted them or was sexually aggressive			1
" over and over again , we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence , only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork			0
when will it end ? " he asked			0
" it is long past time for this media vilification of mr. @entity1 to stop			1
" the media is violating its own reporting standards by rushing the women 's stories to air or print , he said			2
" the new , never - before - heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated , fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30 , 40 , or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity , " he wrote , adding the claims are " increasingly ridiculous			0
" for decades , @entity1 was thought of in glowing terms as a perceptive comedian , upbeat pitchman and genial father figure			2
his public personality made him more than rich -- it made him a role model , admired for his support of education and his no - nonsense talks on parenting and achievement			0
in recent weeks , that persona has been countered by another , much more sinister image , one @entity8 vehemently disputes .			0

" a guy does n't have to answer to innuendos , " @entity1 tells newspaper
@entity1 has been accused in the press by a number of women who say they were sexually assaulted
the comedian , who is 77 , has never been charged with any such crime
