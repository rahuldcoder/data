@entity0 , @entity1 -- standing onstage , comedian @entity3 describes how his cousin in the @entity5 likes to curse the @entity6 -- in @entity7			1
@entity8 ( left ) says @entity5 get a bad rap in the media			1
@entity11 has the name of a " most - wanted " terrorist			2
" arabs love to cuss in @entity7 , " @entity3 belts out			2
" they cuss their heads off in @entity7 , but they wo n't do it in @entity18 because then @entity19 can hear them			2
" the audience , two - thirds of @entity5 descent , explodes in laughter			1
@entity3 is a member of the " @entity24 " comedy group , a collection of comics with @entity5 roots who have formed a niche by taking on @entity5 stereotypes and making subjects such as war , terrorism and suicide bombers funny			1
it 's a delicate balance , but one that seems to be catching on with a larger audience			2
the comics ' videos on @entity41 have been viewed more than 200,000 times , they recently had a one - hour special on @entity43 and they currently are on a 15 - city tour with packed crowds			1
how do they make such serious topics funny ? the key , @entity3 says , is getting the audience on board			2
" let them know that ' hey , i get it , you guys have a stereotype of us , and i know what you see			2
' " ethnic humor has a long history in the @entity6 , but @entity3 says being @entity5 is different			1
he says people too often think of militants , terrorists and suicide bombers			0
" you just say you 're @entity67 , and it 's like you made a political statement			0
" and so the group has worked to try to change those stereotypes , one laugh at a time			2
in november 2005 , the comics took up the name @entity24 , playing off the term president @entity75 used in his 2002 @entity76 address to describe @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
there are four members of the @entity24 comedy group			1
@entity3 is a @entity83 , and @entity8 is an @entity78 - @entity6 with a degree in political science from the @entity86			0
( @entity8 was one of the stars of the @entity89 series " @entity90			0
" ) rounding out the @entity24 are @entity11 , an @entity91 , and @entity92 , a @entity83 who once was a practicing attorney			1
their biting humor is something to which many in their audience can relate			0
@entity8 says when he tells one joke begging for the news media to show @entity5 doing something positive -- like " baking a cookie or something " -- the crowd loves it for more than just its humor			1
" that gets a laugh , but it also gets a clap from regular audiences , and i think that 's because a lot of people are sick of seeing @entity5 depicted the way we 're always depicted , " he says			1
@entity92 says he never felt like a @entity5 until after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
now , he says , he does his comedy " not just for me			0
" " it 's for my cousins , it 's for my friends , it 's for other @entity120 and other people who get dirty looks or looked at funny because they have an accent or are viewed as suspicious simply because of their heritage , " he says			2
" we do n't want to be defined any longer by the worst examples in our community , and it 's a very small amount of people			0
there are a few terrorists and they define all of us			0
" @entity11 says he gets problems at the airport -- because his name matches the alias of a terrorist on the @entity138 's " @entity139 " list			1
but he takes it in stride			0
like his fellow @entity24 comedians , he says , you can " scare people into laughing			1
" he quotes a comedy colleague who is a rabbi			0
" he always says you ca n't hate anybody when you 're laughing with them			0
so it 's nice , when we 're doing our comedy show , to see the diversity in the crowd and people actually laughing together , " @entity11 says			0
" you see @entity120 and @entity155 and @entity156 and whites , and they 're all sitting together and they 're sharing the same laugh			0
comedy 's like food or music			0
