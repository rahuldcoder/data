-- the " @entity2 " franchise returns to theaters friday minus its central character , @entity2 , but with a new hero and story -- a turn that caught even its writer / director , @entity8 , by surprise			1
@entity8 's behind the prior three " @entity2 " scripts , and a fourth film was n't at all in his future plans , the @entity12 - nominated director told @entity0 last week			1
as for returning for " @entity16 , " @entity8 said , " it was n't something i anticipated			1
" in fact , he was initially more akin to the fans who did n't see a need for another " @entity2 " film in the first place			1
" that 's where i started , " @entity8 said with a laugh			1
" that 's how i came in with that first conversation			0
" and yet , with all of that hesitancy , the new character he found in @entity31 ended up winning him over			1
portrayed by @entity12 nominee @entity33 ( who 's already had a blockbuster summer as @entity35 in " @entity36 " ) , @entity31 is an agent with another government program called outcome , which creates agents with medically enhanced cognitive and physical capabilities			1
thanks to the actions of @entity44 's @entity2 in the last " @entity2 " film , 2007 's " @entity45 , " @entity31 finds himself in jeopardy as @entity2 's exposure risk creates problems for @entity38			1
the timelines of " @entity45 " and " @entity16 " are parallel to one another , although you wo n't see @entity2 in this installment			2
neither @entity44 nor " ultimatum " director @entity53 were interested in a round four , and " after those guys left , the studio and the estate [ of ' @entity2 ' series author @entity57 ] were very aggressively trying to figure out what they were going to do next , " @entity8 said			1
" i do n't think i was the only person they were talking to			0
" they held a meeting , and @entity8 agreed to watch " ultimatum " for the first time and see whether that sparked any ideas			2
viewing @entity68 ' " ultimatum " made @entity8 ponder what could happen if there was a " larger conspiracy ... and it turns out there 's a whole other world outside			1
" with encouragement from his brother , @entity75 , who 's also a screenwriter and shares credit with @entity8 on " @entity16 , " @entity8 presented the idea to the studio -- still not expecting that he 'd be the one to write the script			2
" i came in and thought , hire me for two weeks and i 'll play with that idea and we 'll figure out who else at the end of it			0
and it got better than i thought , quickly , and even still it was n't something that i was going to write , much less direct			0
" and then , the character of @entity31 " came into focus , " @entity8 said			1
" i realized what a really sort of exciting piece of meat that was to throw on the grill there , and that 's when i got more excited and then ... some time after that , i did n't want to let it go			2
i got into it , and when we made the deal to write the script , why do n't we make a directing deal at the same time			0
" @entity8 's directed two projects before " @entity16 , " including the well - received @entity104 vehicle " @entity105 , " but nothing on such a large scale , he said			1
" the other films , and i mean this in a good way , they were very claustrophobic			0
they were very , very contained			0
everybody was trapped , " @entity8 said			2
" we 're sort of blowing out the walls here and saying there 's a much bigger world that the audience needs to see			1
we expand in specific ways with the camera and how we shoot every day , but also [ there 's ] much more design in this movie			2
we built a lot more , we travel around the world a lot more , we go a lot wider			0
" he 's also employing a different story structure , having @entity31 ' character converge on the paths of @entity133 's retired col. @entity132 , " the mastermind of the entire franchise , " and then @entity136 as dr. @entity137 , a research scientist involved with the @entity38 program who teams up with @entity141 to survive			1
rather than have her enter the plot through @entity31 , she 's on her own journey , @entity8 said , noting how " that in itself is a really much more open perspective			1
" @entity136 , who told @entity0 that she 's a " huge fan of the original trilogy " as well as writer / director @entity8 , said that what intrigued her about this installment is that " it lifts the curtain on the first three and it shows you who was really in charge , who was really the puppeteer behind all the puppets			1
so if you think you knew what was happening in the first three , you actually did n't			0
" the hunt for the right actor to play the franchise 's new agent was a long and publicly documented one , a process that was difficult because @entity8 knew he needed an actor with the skill to carry the theatrical components but who could also handle the physical rigor of the shoot			1
" the part 's really demanding , and @entity44 [ @entity44 ] had established a level of excellence , " @entity8 said			1
" we just needed a really , really great , up - and - down , everyday , ca n't believe what you 're seeing kind of actor			0
and that person also had to be an athlete ... because of the way these films work , everything 's so real			0
we 're not a big green screen , fake - it kind of show			0
" to top it off , they also needed an actor unknown enough to not draw immediate past references in the minds of moviegoers , but not so new there was n't any recognition at all			0
examining all those needs , the guy left standing was @entity33			2
10 sexy movie spies " @entity33 was just sort of like a ship that was just sitting there right on the horizon waiting to come in and unload , " @entity8 said			1
for his part , @entity33 told @entity0 that while he did n't necessarily feel pressure to live up to @entity44 , he did hold himself to a personal standard of excellence when it came to performing the action work			2
" all i had to really live up to in my mind was that physical part that @entity44 was doing in the previous films , and that level of authenticity and the ferocity of that action			0
you ca n't fake these things , " @entity33 said			2
" it would do a big disservice to this franchise to not be able to perform what was asked of me and what was required of me			0
" and as for the skeptics , @entity8 learned to stop worrying about them long ago			2
it 's known that the " @entity2 " franchise has n't been " the most streamlined 12 , 13 years of a franchise ; there 's been all kinds of rambunctious production history and personality clashes and all the rest of the stuff that 's there , " @entity8 said			1
" the one thing that sort of kept it going ... and i think this comes from @entity44 more than anything else , no one ever really did it for the money			0
" the studio might have been driven by dollars , but " everybody was always like , ' if it 's not going to be right , we all have other things to do , ' " he went on			0
" so it 's like , if there 's not a good reason to do it , no one 's going to do it			0
that was true for the first three and that was certainly true for me in this			0
" @entity0 's @entity251 contributed to this report .			0

writer / director @entity8 did n't expect to return to the ' @entity2 ' franchise
what lured him back was the character of @entity31
star @entity33 was like " a ship sitting on the horizon waiting to come in and unload "
@entity8 : there 's a much bigger [ " @entity2 " ] world the audience needs to see
