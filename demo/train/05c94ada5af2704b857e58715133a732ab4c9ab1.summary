-- it now seems like a lifetime ago that a young man in @entity3 , @entity4 , first pinned the @entity6 sheriff 's badge to his shirt			1
it was 1965 , and he had just beaten the man who took the office from his daddy four years earlier			1
the young man is 80 now , with a lawman son of his own			1
but @entity14 is still wearing that badge			1
he is believed to be the longest - serving sheriff in the @entity17			1
@entity14 says he did n't set out to make history , and that it recently " struck me that enough is enough			1
" he has decided to hang up his holster for good			2
from running the jailhouse to rounding up criminals , @entity14 witnessed the best and worst his fellow man had to offer during 12 terms as sheriff			1
he has worked for the department since 1953 , when he started at the bottom as a deputy			2
" i 'm just thankful to the citizens of @entity6 for seeing fit to elect me			1
" @entity14 recently told @entity0 in a telephone interview			1
" it 's been an enjoyable career and i 'd love to do it again			1
" while @entity14 says he 's ready for retirement , his wife of 58 years , @entity34 , is n't so sure			1
" he does n't golf , he does n't bowl , he does n't dance , " she said			0
" i do n't know what he 's going to do			1
" for starters , he will try to keep the sheriff 's business in the family			1
his father , @entity44 , was the @entity6 sheriff from 1931 to 1961			1
now , his son , @entity45 , 50 , is hoping voters will choose him on november 6 to succeed his dad and become the county 's third @entity48			1
" i never take anything for granted , " @entity50 said of his chances at the polls			0
" but it 's been going good , it 's been very positive			1
" @entity6 , population 55,000 or so , derives its name from the @entity59 band of @entity60			1
it is a slice of agricultural @entity17 near the center of @entity4 and is also know for its golf courses			1
the county 's most popular event is the annual @entity66 , which is held each year on the third wednesday in october			2
a @entity68 like his father , the younger @entity14 is a veteran law enforcement officer			1
he spent 32 years climbing the ranks from deputy to lieutenant before retiring in february			0
" my father never wanted to show any favoritism , " he said , " i was there for 12 years before i was promoted			1
working for your dad was n't easy			0
we butted heads a lot			0
" @entity80 was raised to be a lawman			0
he was born in the official sheriff 's residence , located inside the old jail			1
what was confinement to the inmates was home to three generations of @entity89			0
" i was the matron , " his wife , @entity34 , recalled			0
" i took care of all the adult women and the juvenile boys and girls , and that was quite an experience			0
" a new lockup replaced the old jailhouse 20 years ago			0
the sheriff 's staff , which began with just a small handful , now numbers more than 100			1
@entity80 still goes to work on sundays and holidays			0
he has 10 walkie - talkies in the house -- including one in the bathroom , and another in the laundry , said his wife			2
but if his dedication remains the same , many other aspects to the jobs have changed over the years			0
" when i first ran for the office , there were a lot of things you can do with a handshake without worrying about the controversy , " @entity80 said			2
" and where i find it very difficult is the way criminal statutes have changed			0
the maneuvers you have to go through in the courts , it seems you have roadblocks wherever you go			0
" those obstacles make the pursuit of justice more difficult , the sheriff says			2
" i 'm the kind of person that feels if you do something , you commit a crime , you pay , " he explains			0
" i do n't want somebody charged that is not guilty			0
it used to be if someone was arrested they would have to get their own attorney , now all they got to do is say they do n't have the funds and the state appoints a public defender and that 's added money			2
you ca n't take a chance today			0
" @entity14 is passionate about his profession			1
" he 's given 24/7 , " wife @entity34 said			2
" as sheriff , he never gets away			2
we 've sat down for @entity157 dinner and he 'd get a call and we would n't see him for 24 hours			0
he never stopped to eat , he would keep going until he got his man			0
" it 's in @entity14 's blood , their son agrees			1
" he demands so much			0
he wants to know everything that 's going on			2
he lives it , eats it , breathes it			0
" asked what the hardest part of the job is , sheriff @entity14 does n't hesitate : " when you have to go to a motor vehicle accident and notify the next of kin			1
the knock on the door and the mom in her bathrobe answers and you have to tell them that her son was just killed			2
" retiring will give @entity80 more time to spend with his children and grandchildren			0
he and his wife will get the chance to do things they never could while he was on the job			0
" our health is still good and we better take what time we have and enjoy ourselves instead of looking back and saying ' i wish we did this , ' " he said , adding that he leaves without regrets and knows he did the best he could			0
and he said he 's ready for some down time			2
" if anyone does n't like me because of what i 've done , so let it be , " he said			0
i 've done my job			0
