-- @entity3 and @entity2 's executions are back on the schedule for next week after @entity6 's high court lifted their stays , saying they had no right to know the source of the drugs that will be used to kill them			1
the inmates , who are being held at the @entity13 in @entity14 , where they are slated to be executed by lethal injection tuesday , had challenged the state 's so - called secrecy provision , which forbids disclosing the identities of anyone involved in the execution process or suppliers of any drugs or medical equipment			1
@entity3 and @entity2 also challenged the state @entity26 ' failure to divulge which drugs would be used , but the department disclosed what drugs it intended to use before the high court 's decision : midazolam , which causes unconsciousness , along with pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride , which shut down breathing and the heart			1
the @entity38 said the only remaining issue , then , is whether the state 's failure to disclose its source for the drugs prevents the prisoners from challenging their executions using the @entity47 's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment			1
the court decided it did not			0
" this court holds that the secrecy provision ... does not violate the inmates ' constitutional right of access to the courts , " the wednesday ruling said			0
attorney @entity57 , who represents both men , called the ruling unacceptable and told @entity0 affiliate @entity59 that there was no way to know if the prisoners ' executions " would be carried out in a constitutional and humane manner			2
" " it 's not even known whether the lethal injection drugs to be used were obtained legally , and nothing is known about their source , purity , or efficacy , among other questions , " he told the station			1
" @entity6 's extreme secrecy surrounding lethal injection undermines our courts and democracy			2
" attorney general @entity77 applauded the decision , saying the state had a longstanding precedent of keeping the drug sources secret to avoid " schemes and intimidation used by defense counsel and other anti-death - penalty groups			2
" " these death row inmates have not contested their guilt for murdering two innocent victims nor have they contested their sentences of death			0
the legal wrangling of the attorneys for @entity3 and @entity2 has served only to delay their punishment for the heinous crimes they committed , " he told @entity59			2
@entity3 was convicted in 2000 of a bevy of crimes , including first - degree murder , first - degree rape , kidnapping and robbery in a 1999 home invasion and crime spree that left @entity105 dead and two people injured			0
in 2003 , @entity2 was convicted for the 1997 first - degree rape and murder of his then - girlfriend 's 11 - month - old daughter , @entity109			0
the constitutionality of lethal injection drugs and drug cocktails has made headlines since last year , when @entity116 manufacturers -- including @entity118 - based @entity117 , which manufactures pentobarbital -- banned @entity121 prisons from using their drugs in executions			1
thirty - two states were left to find new drug protocols			0
" the states are scrambling to find the drugs , " @entity126 , executive director of the @entity128 - based @entity127 , said in november			0
" they want to carry out these executions that they have scheduled , but they do n't have the drugs and they 're changing and trying new procedures never used before in the history of executions			0
" if @entity3 and @entity2 are executed next week , they would be the 194th and 195th inmates @entity6 has executed since 1915 .			1

@entity3 and @entity2 are now scheduled to be executed tuesday
