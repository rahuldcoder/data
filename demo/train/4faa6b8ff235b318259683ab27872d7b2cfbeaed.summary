-- season 40 of " @entity2 " kicked off over the weekend with much the same assessment as previous seasons : talent that needs seasoning , up - and - down sketches and mixed reviews			1
" @entity10 's ' growing pains over as it enters its 40th season ? it certainly did n't seem that way from the show 's bizarre season opener , " wrote @entity13 's @entity12			1
on the other hand , @entity18 's @entity17 praised the opener as " one of the better , more consistently funny episodes in a good while			1
" 40 reasons why ' snl ' matters certainly , uneven " @entity26 " are nothing new			0
but the new season , with a combination of winning host @entity28 and some fresh faces , seemed to draw particularly diverse critiques			2
the best reviews were for a taped bit on future @entity35 projects -- including films based around shopping carts and someone named @entity41 -- that , the studio promised , will make a mint			2
" who 's @entity41 ? does n't matter			0
' @entity41 ' will make $ 3 billion , " the voiceover said			0
" @entity28 's starring role in ' @entity48 ' served as the inspiration for the night 's best taped bit , " wrote @entity46 's @entity45			0
on the other hand , new @entity54 anchor @entity53 was " hobbled " by " lame jokes , " @entity45 said , not to mention his own nervousness			0
" his appearance was a bit rocky : he flubbed a few lines and took a while to get into a rhythm with @entity61 , " @entity17 wrote			0
if anyone came out well , it was new player @entity64 , who earned plaudits all over the place			1
" @entity64 ... was the revelation of the episode , " @entity17 wrote			2
and @entity69 definitely smiled on the 20 - year - old			0
" this kid is a star # @entity2 , " tweeted @entity71			2
" snl 's new featured player @ petedavidson stole the whole show tonight during weekend update ! " @entity78 added			1
