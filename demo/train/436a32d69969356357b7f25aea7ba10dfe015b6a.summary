-- @entity1 was half - bald at age 13			0
she just could n't stop pulling her hair , and ended up taking out every lock from the tops of her ears to the crown of her head			1
@entity10 is such a stigmatizing disorder that people will go to great length to hide it , experts say			1
" it was absolutely terrifying because i was a very bright child , and doing great in school , " she said			0
" the doctor had no idea what it was			0
" @entity19 continued pulling her hair throughout her teens , 20s , and early 30s			1
it was n't until she was 33 that she learned her condition had a name : trichotillomania			1
she became inspired to start an organization , called the @entity28 , to help other sufferers of the disorder			0
it turns out that this condition , characterized by the urge to pull hair from one 's body , affects about 2 to 4 percent of the population , according to the @entity28			1
a new study published this week in the @entity39 may hold promise for those who compulsively pull their hair			1
researchers say participants who took an antioxidant called @entity46 , sold over the counter at vitamin stores , had significant improvement over patients who took placebos			0
the dietary supplement used in the study is known for its benefits to the kidneys and liver , said lead author dr. @entity56 at the @entity57 , who is on the advisory board of the @entity28			1
more recently it has been shown to affect glutamate , a chemical messenger in the brain that seems to be involved in compulsive repetitive behaviors , he said			0
the sample size was small -- 50 people -- but the study has generated enthusiasm among trichotillomania researchers			1
" this is one of the bigger advances we 've had within this field in a long time , " said @entity68 , associate professor of psychology at the @entity70 , @entity71			0
psychologists are still debating how to categorize trichotillomania , @entity68 said			2
many believe it is related to obsessive compulsive disorder , but others liken it to addictions or impulse control disorders			0
researchers are unsure of exactly what goes on in the brain with this disorder			0
some people with trichotillomania feel pleasure in pulling hair , while others describe it as " calming , " and still others have no idea why they do it , @entity56 said			1
there may be differences in the brain pathways among people with the condition , he said			2
for @entity19 , pulling hair up made her feel as if her whole nervous system lit up , she said			2
" basically my fingers would search for a texture , a certain type of hair , when i found it , i would pull it out , " she said			1
" i would feel like i had found gold			0
" the condition affects primarily women and usually begins in childhood or adolescence , @entity68 said			0
the term , coined in 1889 by a @entity118 physician , comes from the @entity118 words for its features : " tricho " means " hair , " " till " means " to pull , " and " mania " means " frenzy			1
" long before the disorder had a name , the idea of compulsive hair - pulling had been known for hundreds of years , @entity68 said			2
the two main kinds of medications that have been used for trichotillomania are selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors -- ssris , used for depression -- and the @entity135 drug chlorimipramine , @entity68 said			1
the antidepressants may help patients ' anxiety and depression but do n't actually help the pulling , whereas chlorimipramine has been shown to dampen the pulling impulse somewhat			2
but the treatment that has demonstrated the most effectiveness so far is behavior therapy , @entity68 said			0
the dietary supplement probably will not replace the need for behavioral therapy , but future research may find that they two approaches work well together , @entity56 said			1
before trying @entity46 , people should consult their physicians , particularly to determine whether there are interactions that the supplement could have with other medications the patient already takes , @entity56 said			1
experts say there are still many people who compulsively pull their hair and do n't know that they are not the only ones			1
@entity10 is such a stigmatizing disorder that people will go to great lengths to hide it -- to explain bald spots to acquaintances , some patients will lie and say they had cancer , @entity68 said			2
" i have talked to patients who have pulled for 25 years , and their husbands do n't even know it , they hide it so well , " he said			0
people with the disorder do n't just pull from their heads -- they also pull hair from their eyebrows , eyelashes , and pubic regions , @entity68 said			1
living with the disease , @entity19 at times felt suicidal			0
she dropped out of high school because she was terrified of her friends finding out			0
" there was a time in my early 20s when i really , seriously considered , could i cut my hands off and live my life ? " she said			0
" my hands were my enemies , because they pulled my hair			2
" to manage her condition 18 years ago , @entity19 tried relaxation techniques for the situations that led to her pulling			0
for example , she tended to pull her hair while driving , so she bought thin leather gloves and told herself that she could not remove them -- or pull her hair -- until she turned the car off			1
today , there are many more strategies available to help people identify the triggers for hair - pulling and figure out the best way to control the impulses in those situations , @entity19 said			1
the @entity28 has assisted more than 100,000 people in some way since 1991 , @entity19 said			2
the organization holds conferences , retreats , professional training sessions , and other programs to help people manage the disorder			2
the center also helps health care professionals learn about treating people for the condition			2
" to experience the entrapment of this type of compulsion , and then to experience the freedom of living without it is a gift i wish for everyone , " @entity19 said			0
