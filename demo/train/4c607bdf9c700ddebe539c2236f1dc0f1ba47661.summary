@entity0 -- one of the world 's largest concrete pumps is being readied to get on a massive cargo plane and head to @entity6 , all part of the effort to address the crisis at the @entity11 nuclear power plant			1
the 190,000 - pound truck pump was moved off a job on the @entity14 on wednesday and , two days later , was in @entity15 , @entity16			1
once preparations are complete , it will head about 7,000 miles toward @entity19 aboard a @entity22 @entity21 cargo plane , which is considered among the world 's biggest aircrafts			0
the @entity26 @entity25 had been using the big pumper at a mixed oxide fuel plant construction site in southeastern @entity29			1
eventually , nuclear waste is to be disposed of here			2
but the decision was made to transfer it to @entity6 -- along with several other such large pumps , from around the world -- in order to deal with a disaster that has been brewing since a march 11 earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc at the plant and stoked fears about massive releases of radiation			0
" i use the pump every day at the river site , but they 're trying to avert a situation that worsens each day , " said @entity45 , the owner of @entity46 that supplies concrete for the @entity14 facility			2
" they need all this equipment			0
" @entity58 officials say the prep work should be done by this weekend			0
then , @entity29 's transportation department must sign off on necessary highway and bridge permits , which are required due to the pumper truck 's immensity			1
eventually , it will be driven south to @entity0 , to be ideally flown out of the country by next friday			2
@entity45 did n't have all the details about how the concrete pump will be used once it gets to @entity6 , though he understood its first mission will be to pump water into the stricken facility 's reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools to prevent overheating and the further emission of radioactive material			1
" i understand it will be used to pump water into the reactor and later they can use it for concrete operations that need to be done , " said @entity45			2
the big pump , one of a handful of such trucks built by the the @entity87 company @entity86 , appears to be tailor - made for this type of project -- especially in a radioactive environment			0
its 70 - meter boom can be controlled remotely , which should allow it to disperse cooling water in pinpointed locations over a large distance , say experts			0
typically trucks this massive are used in large projects using concrete , such as the construction of bridges or high - rise buildings			0
according to @entity86 's website , the company has already re-directed a truck - mounted concrete pump from an unknown location in @entity19 to head to the @entity11 site , which is 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity109			1
another smaller @entity86 pumper , currently in @entity111 , is also being readied to fly to @entity6			0
this is not the first time the @entity87 company 's large concrete pumps have been utilized to help address a nuclear crisis			1
in 1986 , 11 @entity86 concrete pumps were used after the @entity119 accident in @entity120 , then a part of the @entity122			1
the reactors ' core were encased in massive amounts of concrete , to prevent the further release of any more radiation .			0

a 190,000 - pound truck pump is now in @entity16 , being prepped to fly out of @entity0
it had been at a mixed oxide fuel plant site in southeast @entity29
a *contractor* says the truck 's first *priority* will be to supply water to keep nuclear fuel cool
*similar* pumps were used in @entity119 , which was eventually encased in concrete
