-- first , @entity1 offered an honorary degree to @entity3 , an outspoken critic of @entity4			1
then apparently when officials actually familiarized themselves with her writing after several complaints , they took the offer back this week			0
one @entity12 contributor calls it " an honor killing , @entity1 - style			1
" that 's crass , but the university 's behavior is certainly disappointing			1
it smacks of cowardice , and @entity3 ca n't be blamed for seeing it as an attack on her personal dignity			1
an act that was meant to honor her has been turned into an opportunity to shame her -- and , as she pointed out , " the slur on my reputation is not the worst aspect of this episode			0
more deplorable is that an institution set up on the basis of religious freedom should today so deeply betray its own founding principles			0
" indeed , the fear of creating offense is not compatible with academic freedom			1
on the contrary , criticizing society in the boldest terms possible is what intellectuals are there to do			0
so @entity1 ought to have stood by its invitation			1
but there are some who would ask why it made the invitation in the first place			0
if the institution was worried about generating controversy , all it had to do was @entity52 her name to discover that @entity3 is a very controversial person			2
indeed , her views fall well outside of the mainstream			0
@entity3 's story is undeniably moving			1
born in @entity57 , she was the victim of female genital mutilation at the age of 5 and was betrothed into an arranged marriage , which she escaped by seeking political asylum in the @entity62			0
thereafter she emerged as a forceful , politically engaged critic of @entity4 -- her memoir , " @entity65 , " is an extraordinary testament to the horrors that fundamentalism can wrought on an individual			1
her ethnicity excuses her from the charge of racism ; her politics is not reactionary but rather a very muscular variety of liberal universalism			0
however , the @entity4 that @entity3 knew and denounces is a narrow cultural experience -- not the reality of the religion as a whole			1
there is no female genital mutilation in the @entity82 ; tribes do it because it is a custom , not a legitimate religious instruction			0
likewise , the extreme islamism that threatens the @entity88 -- and against which the right campaigns -- is a small , geographically limited phenomenon that is almost unrelated to the considerably more liberal forms of @entity4 practiced in , say , @entity93 or @entity94			2
it is true that @entity97 @entity96 or @entity98 have been theocratic , but this does n't make @entity4 incompatible with democracy			1
far from it : @entity103 political protest has been the heart and soul of the @entity106			0
and @entity3 's insistence that " violence is inherent in @entity4 " is absurd			1
violence is inherent in all of humanity -- you only have to read the @entity112 to find that out			0
and if violence was a purely @entity103 thing , would n't we expect @entity103 universally to hold fascistic views ? on the contrary , evidence suggests that globally they lean toward democracy , pluralism and a qualified gender equality			2
moreover , @entity3 's personal experience of life growing up in war - torn @entity126 is a million miles away from that lived among second - or third - generation @entity103 immigrants in @entity94			1
there the picture is one of integration , spoiled only by a handful of radicals who were tolerated by both the state and the @entity4 community for far too long			2
@entity139 journalist @entity138 recently wrote a widely read piece pointing out that newspaper headlines about @entity4 fundamentalism give a distorted view of religious relations in the @entity139			2
he noted , " last year ... the @entity145 of @entity146 were facing the closure of their synagogue			0
its roof was leaking , and the few dozen remaining regulars could not afford the repairs ... as things turned out , the synagogue was saved after a fundraising campaign led by a local mosque			0
@entity157 , the secretary of @entity146 's @entity158 , now refers to ( synagogue chairman @entity159 -- who fled the @entity160 -- as his ' newfound brother			0
' " when i wrote a piece in the same newspaper arguing that @entity4 was very close to @entity165 in its obsession with good manners , hospitality and charity , i received dozens of abusive missives from white supremacists			1
it was a reminder that the flipside of @entity174 is anti-muslim hate			0
which , i 'm afraid to say , is given propaganda material by the well - dressed , middle - class intellectuals who appear so frequently on our televisions to pronounce that " violence is inherent in @entity4			2
" all of which does n't mean that @entity3 should be driven from the public sphere			1
on the contrary , her story is a testament to the evil that does exist in the world , and @entity1 should have stood by its decision to honor her			2
the right to speak freely should never be tampered with			0
but in the conversation about the limits to this speech that has followed , let this one fact be remembered : @entity3 's views are deemed politically incorrect for good reason .			1

@entity197 : @entity1 *withdrew* honorary degree offer to @entity4 critic @entity3
he says move runs *counter* to academic freedom , @entity1 should n't have *withdrawn* it
had university *vetted* her , it would have seen her views on @entity4 are narrow , he says
