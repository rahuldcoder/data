-- the captain is still in charge			0
no matter how technologically advanced a cruise ship may be or how modern its safety procedures or how strict the web of international regulations , passenger safety still depends on the captain 's ability to make good decisions			1
it 's not clear what difference more stringent regulations would have played in the decisions of captain @entity15 , who allegedly deviated from a set route , abandoned ship after the disaster with passengers still aboard and did not return to the ship to lead rescue efforts when ordered by local port officials , according to transcripts between authorities and the captain			1
in light of the @entity15 disaster , the new head of the @entity29 -- the @entity31 agency responsible for shipping safety , security and prevention of marine pollution -- has promised to look into the regulation of large passenger ships			1
" we should seriously consider the lessons to be learnt and , if necessary , re-examine the regulations on the safety of large passenger ships in the light of the findings of the casualty investigation , " @entity29 secretary - general @entity40 said in a statement released monday			2
" in the centenary year of the @entity49 , we have once again been reminded of the risks involved in maritime activities			0
" passengers first , then crew , then captain in addition to the @entity31 agency , a ship is subject to the laws of the country whose flag it flies , often called " flag administration			1
" the ship may also be subject to the laws of a country where it stops			0
( the @entity15 did n't stop in @entity67 ports carrying @entity67 passengers , which means it was n't subject to @entity70 regulations , according to @entity71 , senior marine inspector of the @entity70 's @entity72			1
) in the @entity15 case , the laws of @entity74 also apply			2
@entity77 may face charges including manslaughter , shipwreck and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board , chief prosecutor @entity76 said			1
abandoning ship is a maritime crime that has been on the books for centuries in @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity74 , according to @entity90 , a lawyer in @entity91 , although many other countries have long abandoned it			1
although @entity67 law does n't single out abandoning ship as a crime , it 's a longtime maritime tradition that the captain be the last one off a sinking ship , according to maritime law professor @entity98 , visiting professor of law at @entity99 and the @entity100			1
" if you 're going to be master of a ship , your responsibility is first to your passengers , second to your crew , then you look after yourself , " said @entity98 , a @entity98 veteran			2
" it 's shameless and dishonorable [ for the captain ] to take himself out of the mix like that			0
" current international regulation under current international regulations , each cruise company must have a safety plan , called a safety management system , that details responsibilities in the event of an emergency , @entity71 said			1
in the event of a fire on board , the captain would sound the general emergency alarm -- seven short blasts followed by one longer blast -- to direct crew members to fight the fire and direct passengers to their specified " muster " stations , where passengers are directed during safety drills to gather in event of emergency			1
if the incident is contained , passengers might be allowed to resume their normal activities or be kept away from the damaged part of the ship until a return to port , or they might be required to abandon ship			2
" the call to abandon is made by the captain , " @entity71 said			0
" when the abandon ship signal is made , they have 30 minutes to get everyone off the ship , even though the general emergency could have started a day or hour before			0
" it 's not clear to @entity150 maritime attorney @entity149 why the captain did n't issue a mayday signal to call for outside help soon after the accident			0
" [ a captain needs ] to know your ship and what danger your ship is in , " he said			2
" @entity160 and listing is a pretty good sign " of distress			0
passengers can be prepared while passengers have little or no control over the abilities of their captain or crew , disasters like the @entity15 are rare			1
still , passengers can take steps to ensure a safe trip much of the time			0
@entity177 recommends that @entity67 citizens who are traveling internationally register with the @entity67 @entity180 's free @entity179 ( @entity181 ) at https://travelregistration.state.gov or directly at @entity67 embassies or @entity67 consulates , @entity176 spokeswoman @entity175 said			1
this will help the @entity180 better help them during an emergency			2
before you board , make a copy of your passport and have a bag with necessities like hard - to - replace medication , said @entity192 , head of the @entity194 's cruise department			0
as soon as you board your ship and arrive at your room , find your life vest and participate in the mandatory safety drill , called a muster drill			2
" if you 've been on a number of cruises , you do n't pay as close attention [ to the muster drill ] as you probably should , " said @entity200 , managing editor of @entity201			1
though attendance is mandatory , he said , there are often a few people who skip the drill			0
find out where you 'll get a life jacket if an emergency keeps you from returning to your room for yours			0
during the cruise , place your purse and necessities in the same place in your room every time you enter			0
whatever went wrong to cause or exacerbate the @entity15 cruise ship disaster , most of the @entity15 crew and passengers safely made it off the ship			1
and though the images of the disaster may turn off many people to cruising , experts say it 's still one of the safest transportation methods available			0
