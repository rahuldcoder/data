@entity0 -- while only the highest echelons of @entity6 's opaque leadership will know the full financial cost of wednesday 's launch , @entity3 's government estimates @entity9 spent $ 1.3 billion on its rocket program this year			1
the two rockets launched this year -- this week 's mission and a failed attempt in april -- cost $ 600 million , while the launch site itself is estimated at $ 400 million			1
other related facilities add another $ 300 million , according to an official from @entity3 's @entity18			1
" this is equivalent to acquiring 4.6 million tons of corn , " the official said			0
" if this was used for solving the food shortage issue , @entity6 would not have to worry about food for four to five years			2
" whatever the cost , what is known is that @entity6 is one of the poorest countries in @entity28 , with an economy worth just $ 40 billion , according to the @entity30			2
but the price of @entity6 's rocket launches might be lower than government estimates because @entity6 workers earn much less than their southern neighbors , says @entity36 , director of @entity3 's @entity37 in @entity38			1
the @entity40 industrial complex , on the border with @entity3 , has some of the country 's highest wage earners at about $ 100 per month , says @entity36 , 14 - year chief of the @entity3 non-governmental organization			2
" this is very high compared to the rest of @entity6			0
if you 're not working in @entity40 , the average worker salary drops to an average of perhaps $ 50 per month			0
" prior to wednesday 's launch , @entity3 threatened tougher sanctions on @entity6 in the footsteps of a 2007 freeze on @entity6 funds held at @entity55 in the @entity57 territory of @entity58			1
@entity36 says some $ 25 million are still frozen there -- illicit funds from money laundering and drug trafficking by the @entity6 regime			0
" but in order to impose further sanctions , @entity57 's involvement is necessary " because @entity67 is @entity9 's closest ally in the world , @entity36 said			2
" i do n't think financial sanctions against @entity6 are the best course of action because that can make the situation out of control			0
" but the financial cost and any risk of further sanctions may be a tradeoff for internal political gain as leader @entity80 tries to solidify his grip on power , as wednesday 's launch comes near the first - year death anniversary of his father , @entity84 , on december 17			1

" if @entity6 succeeds in launching a satellite , @entity6 propaganda may spin this by saying the country has become a prosperous and strong nation			0
that will help @entity80 both consolidate his power and help maintain the legacy of his father			0
" if there is a message to the international community , adds @entity36 , it may be that @entity6 is implying " our satellite launch means we have nuclear weapons , we have a delivery system			0
