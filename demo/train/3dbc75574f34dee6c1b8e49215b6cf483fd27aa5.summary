-- @entity2 's landmark presidential election looks set to go to a run - off vote in which @entity5 candidate @entity4 could face former regime figure @entity6 , according to partial results reported friday			1
ballots are still being counted , and the final results of the first round are due tuesday			1
@entity2 newspaper @entity11 gave @entity4 26.48 % of the vote with results in from 25 of 27 provinces , with @entity6 , who was ousted president @entity16 's last prime minister , close behind with 24.74 % of the vote and leftist @entity18 in third with about 20 %			1
the partial results put @entity19 , a moderate @entity20 running as an independent , and @entity21 , who previously served as foreign minister and headed the @entity23 , in fourth and fifth places , respectively , @entity11 reported			1
results are still to come from the @entity27 and @entity28 provinces , which could prove decisive for the first round of voting , the newspaper said			1
the @entity5 earlier told reporters that with about 90 % of the vote counted , @entity4 -- who heads its political wing , the @entity32 -- was in the lead , with @entity6 in second place			1
if no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the first round , the top two will progress to a run - off to be held june 16 - 17			1
there were 13 candidates on the ballot , although two withdrew from the race after ballots were printed			0
whoever wins the historic vote will become @entity2 's first freely elected president			1
but if the first round results in a run - off between @entity4 and @entity6 , many @entity2 -- particularly liberals and " revolutionaries " -- will be very disappointed , said @entity53 , a visiting fellow at the @entity54 in @entity55 who is currently in @entity2			1
" a lot of @entity2 will feel like this is the worst choice that they would have to make because if it really is between @entity4 and @entity6 , then these are the two most polarizing candidates , " he said			1
many people may opt to stay at home rather than make a " very difficult choice " in the run - off , @entity53 said			0
it is hard to predict where the votes of liberals and revolutionaries will go if they do participate , but the @entity5 will have to work hard if it wants to win them over , having alienated many in the past , he said			2
there is also a chance of further protests and even violence , regardless of who wins , @entity53 said , as revolutionary elements become increasingly marginalized and radicalized			0
" there is a likelihood of a ' revolution part 2 , ' and there is also a growing likelihood of violence , " he said			0
" there are elements that are itching for confrontation on the streets because that 's where they feel they are strong			0
" @entity53 believes the biggest winner could be the country 's current military leadership , which has still to detail the powers of the presidency and may see the election of an ally in @entity6			1
if @entity4 were to win , the military leadership would be likely to constrain the powers of the president , he said -- and in any case is likely to keep control of key areas such as defense and foreign policy			2
the early results do n't appear to suggest a surge in support for the @entity20 , despite @entity4 edging ahead , @entity53 said			1
together , the two main @entity20 candidates -- @entity4 and @entity19 -- seem to have taken about 40 % of the vote , he said , a significant drop in share from the 70 % of seats won in parliamentary elections in january by @entity32 and another @entity20 party			1
this fits with a trend in the last six months against the @entity20 factions and toward stability , @entity53 said			0
" this has worked to the advantage of someone like @entity6 who can capitalize on the fact that people are worried , are becoming more fearful about the security situation			2
( there is ) also a lot of fear - mongering about the @entity20 , " he said			0
" people are disaffected with the @entity20 because they saw they had a couple of months in parliament and did n't do much -- and there 's a growing sense that maybe they are trying to hijack the revolution and take over			0
" that said , the apparent success of @entity4 and @entity6 is not a surprise in that they come from the two most organized , best resourced camps in the election , he said : the @entity5 and the remnants of the old regime			1
@entity4 is an @entity140 - educated engineer who vows to stand for democracy , women 's rights and peaceful relations with @entity144 if he wins the @entity2 presidency			1
he 's also an @entity20 figure who has argued for barring women from the @entity2 presidency and called @entity144 leaders " vampires " and " killers			2
" the @entity5 had originally pledged not to seek the presidency			2
@entity6 , a former air force officer with close ties to @entity2 's powerful military , is seen as representing the interests of the old guard -- those who lost out when president @entity16 was ousted			1
@entity16 led the @entity159 nation for 30 years before being forced out last year amid a popular outcry			2
he is awaiting a court 's verdict and could potentially face the death penalty after going on trial for corruption and allegedly ordering the killing of anti-government protesters			0
about half all @entity2 's roughly 50 million registered voters had cast ballots by the end of thursday , the second and final day in the nation 's historic presidential election , said @entity173 , head of the @entity174			1
amid worries by some that @entity2 's current military rulers might somehow hijack the election , @entity173 detailed the vote counting process -- including checks and balances aimed at ensuring credibility			2
according to the committee head , votes will be tallied in the various polling locales by a judge and in the presence of representatives of the candidates			0
each final count will be announced aloud , then an official report will be filed that can be viewed by nonprofit groups , the media and candidates , @entity173 said			1
the voting is a monumental achievement for those who worked to topple @entity16 in one of the seminal developments of the @entity201 more than a year ago			2
and it could reverberate far beyond the country 's borders , since @entity2 is in many ways the center of gravity of the @entity23 world			2
distrust and anger in @entity2 , particularly against the military 's power in governmental affairs , have inspired continued protests , some of which have been marked by deadly clashes			0
many protesters are upset about what they see as the slow pace of reform since @entity16 's ouster			0
some are also concerned that the country 's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule			0
worries about the powerful military possibly swaying this week 's vote persist despite the insistence of the @entity232 that it will hand over power to an elected civilian government			0
the military leaders put armored personnel carriers on the streets with loudspeakers broadcasting a message that they will relinquish power , but that did not convince doubters			0
in january , two @entity20 parties -- the @entity32 with 235 seats and the conservative @entity244 with 121 seats -- won about 70 % of the seats in the lower house of parliament in the first elections for an elected governing body in the @entity252 era			0
the rest of the assembly 's 498 seats were divided among other parties			0
journalist @entity257 reported from @entity27 , and @entity0 's @entity258 from @entity259 and @entity260 from @entity261 .			0
