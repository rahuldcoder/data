@entity0 , @entity1 -- at this moment we have reached a major turning point for both science and the public at large			0
the @entity7 is now offering the world the first taste of raw @entity7 ( @entity11 ) data collected by the @entity12 in @entity1			1
with this we move closer to fulfilling the institute 's mission , which is to search for our beginnings and our place among the stars throughout the institute 's 25 - year history ( we are a private , nonprofit organization dedicated to scientific research , education and public outreach ) , we have analyzed these raw data with custom algorithms operating on semi-custom hardware			1
now we are transitioning to readily available hardware and servers because technology has caught up to us -- hooray ! in the future , we hope that a global army of open - source code developers , students and other experts in digital signal processing , as well as citizen scientists willing to lend their intelligence to our exploration , will have access to the same technology and join our quest			0
as i look at my team at the @entity7 in @entity0 , and at a handful of other @entity7 teams around the globe , i see very clever individuals who have been willing to forgo the traditional challenges and rewards of academic research to work on a program of immense potential -- to do work that can literally change the world			1
many see @entity7 as a fascinating avocation , but few indeed are willing to make it their vocation			1
read more about @entity58 at @entity59 in 2009 , when @entity59 awarded me its @entity59 prize and the opportunity to make a wish to change the world - - a wish they would help me fulfil l -- i thought of a mirror			1
it is the mirror that we hold up to the planet in our scientific search for the answer to the ancient question , ' are we alone ? ' it is the mirror in which all humans can see themselves as the same , when compared to the extraterrestrial other			2
it 's the mirror that allows us to alter our daily perspectives and see ourselves in a more cosmic setting			0
it is the mirror that reminds us of our common origins in stardust			0
@entity59 and technology are helping me and my team hold up that mirror to all inhabitants of this planet so that we can see our reflection as @entity86			0
i told @entity59 that " i wish that you would empower @entity86 everywhere to become active participants in the ultimate search for cosmic company			2
" soon it will be time for you to get involved by participating at @entity94 , a website that will make available the results that we get from our telescopes			0
right now the site is geared to those knowledgable about digital signal processing , but in the coming months , anyone -- from a child playing a @entity105 game to an interested adult -- can join the search for intelligent life in the cosmos			1
it 's been 50 years since @entity111 and @entity112 published their seminal scientific paper on @entity7 in the journal nature , and since @entity116 first used the @entity118 telescope in @entity119 , @entity120 , to attempt to detect any radio signals from technologies he thought could be orbiting the nearby stars of @entity125 and @entity126			2
since then , only those of us privileged enough to use the marvelous tools of the astronomer have been able to shape this pursuit of cosmic company			0
for the past decade , you and any other person around the globe have been able to leave your computer turned on and search through data recorded at large radio telescopes with the @entity140 screen saver			1
but you could n't change or improve the search your computer was enabling , you could n't get involved creatively			0
you did n't have to see your reflection in the cosmic mirror			0
now that computing has gotten fast enough , now that @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and others have donated resources to the @entity7 , my team and i can benefit from your skills and your energy			2
you can help us with our search			0
access the raw data we have published at @entity105 and show us how to process it in new ways , find signals that our current signal detection algorithms are missing			1
this summer , when we openly publish our software detection code , you can take what you find useful for your own work , and then help us make it better for our @entity7 search			1
as i wished , i 'd like to get all @entity86 spending a bit of their day looking at data from the @entity12 to see if they can find patterns that all of the signal detection algorithms may still be missing , and while they are doing that , get them thinking about their place in the cosmos			0
that 's the way we can change the world ! we do n't yet know how to get our data out of the observatory and presented to willing citizen scientists in real - time -- but if you are technically savvy , that 's where you come in , that 's where you can help us make the search better			1
the @entity7 can begin to count anyone in the world as a member of our team			1
all of the @entity7 searching over the past 50 years is equivalent to examining one 8 - ounce glass of water from the @entity193 's oceans -- a lot of human effort , but not a lot of exploration			2
as our technologies improve exponentially , and as the world joins our searches , we may finally have the right tools for exploring the cosmic ocean			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity58			0

@entity58 says the @entity7 is offering the world raw cosmic data from its telescopes
she said technology has enabled *nonscientists* to help search for extraterrestrial life
when the @entity105 site is fully developed , even kids will be able to search data
@entity58 : more *people* *combing* data means a greater *possibility* of finding signs of life
