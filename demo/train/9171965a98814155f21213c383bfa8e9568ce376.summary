@entity0 , @entity1 -- the crop has been harvested , and @entity5 's secret technique paid off			1
" every morning i would go out and talk to my girls , " she said , " pray over them and ask them to provide good medicine			2
" her " girls " are marijuana plants destined for her son @entity11 's medical marijuana dispensary in @entity13			1
at 48 , she has just wrapped up her first season as a pot farmer			2
her 62 plants yielded 13 pounds			2
@entity18 spent most of her life as a hairdresser and salon owner in a @entity13 suburb			1
" i was into makeup and high - heeled shoes and fancy clothes and working -- a lot , " she said			1
" i sold my salon and moved down to the country			1
i wanted a change of pace			2
" while @entity32 was looking for a midlife career change , her son was building a medical marijuana business , legal in @entity1 since 2000			1
@entity5 loaned him $ 10,000 from the sale of her salon , and he opened @entity37 , a dispensary where patients who have been certified by the state can buy marijuana			1
@entity18 concedes he began his marijuana enterprise on the wrong side of the law , " just getting cheap pounds and flipping them to my friends , " he said			1
he was working full time as an arborist and dealing pot on the side when he saw an opportunity to take his business aboveboard			2
in 2008 , he received state approval to open his dispensary			1
in march , he got a patient 's card , citing chronic pain after a fender - bender			1
the medical marijuana business has boomed in @entity13 during the past year			1
@entity18 's dispensary was in place early , building clientele long before many of the newcomers arrived			1
he has about 200 regular patients , he said , and another 500 who come by from time to time			2
he employs four " bud tenders " and said he grosses about $ 5,000 a day			2
but it 's not always easy to keep the pot in stock			2
though the dispensaries are legal in @entity1 , the laws are vague about growing cannabis			1
legislators want to clarify the regulations , but until then , the dispensaries are getting their marijuana through unconventional routes			2
" the connections are underground			0
they 're not mainstream at all , " @entity18 said			1
" we ca n't call the growers union			0
there is no such thing			0
" instead of placing your order through a typical system ... you get a dude who comes down from the mountains and slaps a duffle bag on your desk			0
it 's full of weed , and he 's like ' here , pick what you want			0
do you want any ? ' and you 've got to dig through it , inspect it for yourself , make sure it looks kosher , weigh it , pay thousands of dollars			0
it 's all cash at this point			0
" see the different ways to take marijuana @entity18 wanted to see those thousands of dollars stay in the family instead of going to the mountain dudes			1
" he called me one day and he said , ' @entity32 , i think we should buy this land ' and ' how do you feel about growing medical marijuana ? ' and i said , ' ok			1
' it was just a faith thing			0
" @entity18 bought 37 acres in rural southern @entity1 , tucked up against the @entity113			1
that 's where his mom 's new life began			0
in june , they paid $ 3,000 for two greenhouses , supplies and marijuana seedlings			1
@entity5 lived in an old camper and tended the plants			1
" it was like an @entity126 course for me , " she said			0
" living off the grid , roughing it			0
we did n't have heat			0
we did n't have running water			0
we did n't have electricity most of the time			0
the batteries were always going dead			0
the greenhouse blew away a couple of times			0
" but at least she had company : first - time marijuana farmers occupy the plots of land on both sides of the @entity18 operation			1
the trio formed an ad hoc collective , helping each other and learning from their mistakes			0
they spent their days tending to their plants and their evenings grilling food along a nearby river			0
one of the trio 's concerns was security			0
their greenhouses are visible from the road and they worry about being robbed or hassled by police			0
so far they have had no trouble , but if one grower needs to go into town for supplies , the others keep a watchful eye			0
by early november , the plants were ready to harvest			0
the @entity170 filled several suvs and pickup trucks with their crop and moved to a house they rented in nearby @entity0			0
a closet in the house is filled with marijuana that is drying out			2
the radio is set to @entity179 as @entity5 's fellow farmers trim the stems and leaves off the plants			1
the leftover twigs are run through a screen to form a powder that is packed by hand to form hashish			0
with only a few pounds left to process , @entity5 is already looking forward to next year			1
she hopes to triple their harvest			0
" i 'm in for the long haul			0
i really do feel like we 're pioneers bringing new life to medical marijuana , " she said			2
@entity5 got her patient card in may before starting the farm , also citing chronic pain			1
she rarely uses medical marijuana			2
@entity18 said that until the state better defines its law , he thinks it 's wise for everyone in the business to have a patient card in case authorities question them while in possession of marijuana			1
@entity1 is one of 14 states that has legalized medical marijuana			1
federal law still bans its use			0
but the @entity213 recently announced it would no longer seek to prosecute people using , prescribing or distributing marijuana for medical purposes as long as they 're in compliance with local laws			2
@entity18 wants to expand his operation based on the models of the two businesses he most admires : @entity222 and @entity223			1
" we hope to develop a business model that proves to be successful , that we can expand upon , hopefully to other states and communities , become like a really reliable consistent supplier of safe , tested cannabis , " he said			2
for @entity5 , her new life in business with her son has n't quite set in			1
" it was n't something i ever dreamed i would be involved in , " she said			0
when her son was growing up , she adds , " i used to bust him all the time for marijuana			1
i used to flush it down the toilet			0

@entity5 sold her hair salon so she and her son could begin a marijuana - growing operation
@entity18 once sold marijuana *illegally* ; now he has a patient card and dispensary
*irwins* set up shop in june in rural @entity1 , between two fellow marijuana farmers
@entity18 wants to model marijuana businesses after @entity222 and @entity223
