-- a few weeks ago , @entity1 ran its now - famous cover : " the @entity4 savior : how @entity5 became the new voice of the @entity4			1
" only time will tell if the junior senator from @entity8 lives up to that billing , and it 's entirely possible that @entity11 will be proven wrong in the coming months and years			0
but there 's one cover that the magazine could run now and be entirely confident in : " the @entity15 : how @entity16 became the real voice of the @entity4			1
at least for the time being , tea party darling sen. @entity16 is the effective leader of the @entity4			1
and that 's a pretty big deal			0
the @entity4 's shellacking in 2012 has thrust a new generation of @entity4 -- including leaders like @entity5 , rep. @entity26 , sen. @entity27 , and @entity28			1
@entity29 and @entity30 -- into the spotlight			0
but it 's @entity16 who has become the clearest voice of the new guard in the @entity4			1
and he is effectively driving the entire @entity4 message right now			1
no one else in the @entity4 has been able to step into a real leadership position , no matter how hard they try			1
@entity26 ? he 's back in the halls of @entity41 trying to figure out how to repackage his failed fiscal approach			1
@entity44 and @entity45 ? congressional republicans have an approval rating in the low teens			1
@entity49 and @entity50 ? each day they seem less like elder statesmen and more like @entity53 from the " @entity54			0
" @entity30 ? he may be the nation 's most popular governor , but conservative groups find @entity57 and @entity58 more compelling these days			0
@entity59 ? he 's already got a conservative @entity60 running ads against him in @entity62 ! @entity63 ? his reentry to the national political dialogue this week was clumsy at best			2
@entity16 is the only guy who appears able at this point to step into the @entity4 leadership void			1
there are two reasons why			0
first , @entity16 has proven that he has the ability to punch his message through in a way that no one else in the @entity4 can			1
whether or not you agree with him ( and i rarely do ) , you know where he stands			0
he articulates his message more clearly than most people in @entity79			0
he 's more ideologically consistent than many people in @entity79 ( though admittedly , that 's not the highest of bars these days )			0
he 's willing to take on leaders of both parties to make a point			1
while many senators in his party have held up nominations for petty political reasons , @entity16 held up @entity91 's nomination over a principled stand that attracted attention from both progressives and conservatives			1
and as several commentators said after the fact , it 's easy to believe that he would have done the same under a @entity4 president			2
@entity16 's also proven to be a master of both old and new media			1
just look at this week			0
he had the entire traditional political press corps and mainstream media focused on him like a laser beam by utilizing one of the most old school tools available to a senator -- the filibuster			2
yet he made it feel new			0
for weeks , the press had been reporting on the use of silent filibusters to hold up nominations and on the attempts at filibuster reform			0
so @entity16 , by forsaking a tool that so many of his colleagues seem to love , and understanding how to capitalize on an existing media narrative , came across looking courageous and principled and dominated the news cycle for 24 hours			1
but what made the move truly genius , was that he launched it through @entity125			0
and as fellow tea party sen. @entity27 stated later on the @entity129 floor , the twitterverse blew up -- further driving the message in both old and new media			2
compare that to @entity5 's response to the @entity135			2
for all of the hype that led up to his speech , what will people truly remember ? that he stopped in the middle to take a drink of water , and that he gave a version in @entity146			0
that 's pretty much it			0
in the breathless rush to rebrand the @entity4 by party leaders , that second point was heralded as a major success			1
but as to the ability to punch through an actual message , @entity16 is running circles around everyone else			1
the second reason why @entity16 has become the party 's most effective messenger is that everyone across the entire ideological spectrum -- from @entity49 , @entity5 and @entity162 to majority leader @entity163 and attorney general @entity164 -- is responding to him			1
@entity5 and @entity27 rushed to floor to bask in the glory of @entity16 's " filiblizzard			1
" attorney general @entity164 sent him a letter clarifying the administration 's position on drones			0
@entity163 and minority leader @entity173 took to the @entity129 floor to applaud @entity16 's conviction ( and bladder control )			2
it was n't all love , however			0
fellow @entity4 sens. @entity49 and @entity50 took to the floor to blast him for his position			2
the problem is that they are decidedly old guard			0
the new faces in the party fell all over themselves to " # standwithrand			0
" @entity16 has people listening and responding to him			2
he 's dictating the conversation			0
and when you look at the ineptitude of the rest of the @entity4 message machine , it 's pretty clear that he is one of the few people in his party that know how to do that			1
@entity196 : @entity16 , a civil liberties hero and civil rights villain now , that does n't mean @entity16 does n't have serious problems			2
on most issues , he is seriously outside of the mainstream			0
he often gets his facts dangerously wrong -- like when he falsely argued that the number of government employees grew under president @entity206 , or when he alleged that the @entity207 was smuggling weapons out of @entity209 to @entity210 , without any proof			0
and at a time when most @entity207 are starving for leaders willing to cross party lines and find common ground , he is about as far from compromise as you can get			0
it 's that last point that may be why @entity16 is so dangerous to the @entity4 moving forward			1
@entity16 said this week that he is seriously considering a run for president in 2016			1
the more he steps in to fill the @entity4 's gaping leadership vacuum , the more others -- and particularly other potential 2016 presidential candidates -- will chase him			1
that means @entity4 leaders run the risk of seeming even more strident , more intolerant , more uncompromising , and more outside the mainstream than they did in 2012			2
those , like @entity30 , that buck this trend run the risk of being ostracized by the conservative grassroots -- something that not a lot of potential @entity4 2016ers have shown much interest in doing			2
even if @entity16 does n't become the nominee , he has the potential to shape the @entity4 field in a way that few others can at this point			1
in short , for now , it 's @entity16 's party			2
and it seems like so many other republicans are simply trying to figure out how to live in it			0
( note : an earlier version of this article incorrectly said the number of federal employees had not grown under president @entity206 ; in fact , the total number of government employees at all levels has not grown since he took office			0
) the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			2

@entity258 says the week highlighted split in the @entity4
he says @entity16 is getting his message out better than @entity5 , @entity26 , @entity45
for @entity4 , danger is that he @entity16 could push 2016 further to the right , he says
@entity258 : @entity16 *combined* old tool of filibuster with new media to make his point
