-- in the third act of the opera " @entity4 , " there is an aria , " @entity9 , " that begins , " oh , my country , i shall never see you again			2
" on january 3 , 1985 , after @entity12 sang those words , the audience at the @entity11 stopped her with a four - minute ovation			1
@entity12 first performed at the @entity15 24 years earlier , and this night , this performance would be her last on an opera stage			1
during the curtain call , she was showered with flowers and confetti as the audience applauded her performance , and career , for 25 minutes			2
she stood there , beautiful , gracious , mouthing the words " thank you " to admirers who clearly did not want to see her go			2
this , ladies and gentlemen , is what a diva looks like			1
i 'm not sure when the meaning of the word went from someone with the talent and life journey of @entity12 to the cast of " @entity40 of ( insert city here ) , " but i know its erosion epitomizes all that is wrong with pop culture today : @entity46 nominations surrendered to actors for carrying a tune , singing competitions judged by people who ca n't really sing , celebrities who are famous for being famous			1
@entity51 is " a creative genius , " but the fact that he repeatedly needs to tell people that makes him more of an anti-diva			1
true divas do n't need to self - promote			1
that 's what their loyal subjects are for			2
@entity12 did n't request a 25 - minute ovation			1
" i 'm trying to exhibit good taste , " @entity12 said of her goodbye			1
" i prefer to leave standing up , like a well - mannered guest at a party			0
" i long for the day when phrases such as " good taste " or " well - mannered " are uttered , let alone displayed , by the people we refer to as divas today			1
we 've always had bubble gum and fluff and raunch , but we used to recognize those things for what they were			0
if being a talentless bad girl is what pays the bills , fine ... but we never used to refer to these train wrecks as " divas			1
" if it sounds as if i 'm blowing things out of proportion , consider this : there is a reality tv show called " @entity90 " with a cast filled with one - hit wonders			0
it 's as if eye - rolling has become the only qualification to be considered a precious gem			0
the reality is , today 's " divas " are more likely to be pieces of charcoal : mass - produced , quick to flame out and apt to leave behind a filthy residue on everything they touch			2
the reason why the notion of a " diva " was reserved for the main female singer in an opera company , like a @entity12 or @entity109 -- who sings in @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 and served as the inspiration for the 1982 film " diva " -- is because the level of talent these women possess was thought of as rare and thus made their demanding personalities tolerable			1
their recordings , treasured ; their presence , captivating ; their performances , transcending all others			0
think @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127			1
today , we use the word so frequently , hardly anyone knows what it means anymore			0
for example , after this year 's @entity134 , @entity133 listed its 16 greatest divas moments and included the pitch - challenged @entity137 -- twice			2
an @entity140 headline actually read : " @entity142 's @entity141			0
" @entity143 once named @entity144			0
" the very existence of such an honor should provoke nausea , because there are not enough true divas in the world to sustain such an annual award			1
bit by bit , we have replaced art that is meant to be slow - cooked art with that which is microwavable ( and forgettable )			0
thus our movie theaters are dominated by remakes and sequels , best - selling authors plagiarize , belching is considered witty			0
@entity164 is a fundraiser music showcase created to support the @entity166			0
the nonprofit was designed to help restore instrumental music programs in public schools after so many were lost due to budget cuts			0
in the beginning , the " divas " who performed were along the lines of @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 ... voices that were iconic , even if you did n't particularly care for their music			2
in the latest installment of the series , @entity182 was among the headliners			0
no , i do n't think i 'm overreacting			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			1

@entity189 : " diva " once applied to people with long records of *achievement*
he says the term now is used for many who are famous for being famous or early in their careers
@entity201 : true divas are people like @entity12 , @entity125 , @entity127
@entity51 calling himself a " creative genius " rules him out of the diva *category* , @entity201 says
