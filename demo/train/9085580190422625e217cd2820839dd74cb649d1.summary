the streets of @entity1 were half empty when i arrived on a monday afternoon			0
the latest war was under way , and @entity5 had just published a critical article i 'd written about @entity8 's air force pilots and the grave consequences of their bombardment of @entity11			1
i came to this southern @entity8 town , not far from @entity11 , to chronicle the fear spreading throughout @entity8 communities near the border			1
as a columnist for the country 's leading liberal newspaper , i am quite used to people being hostile towards my views , but this was something new			2
as i arrived in the town center for a live interview with @entity24 , a crowd of people immediately swarmed around me , cursing me with an aggression that i 've never seen before			0
the bullies encircled me , jumping in front of the camera in an attempt to prevent the interview from going on			0
the show 's host cut the broadcast off			2
the mob hurled insults at me , calling me " garbage " and a " traitor " and accused me of claiming that @entity8 pilots were murderers -- something i never said			1
as the crowd 's anger grew , i rushed to my car and drove out of the town center , the men 's screams trailing off as i steered my way out of @entity1			2
but it was n't just the street mobs			0
leading figures in @entity8 have publically called me a traitor			1
@entity52 , a senior member of prime minister @entity54 's party , called on tv for me to be charged with treason during war time			0
@entity5 has hired a bodyguard to ensure my safety , and my life has been turned upside down by the incident			0
they have n't succeeded in silencing me			0
i will continue to write about the brutality of this war , about the atrocities , the mass killing of civilians and the horrifying destruction in @entity11			1
but i am not the story			0
the real tale to be told is of the unprecedented cracks in @entity8 democracy that have been revealed in just one month of conflict			1
years of nationalistic incitement by the @entity8 government , of expressions of racism , of anti-democratic legislation , of price - tag actions against @entity79 in the @entity80 , without anyone being brought to justice -- all of that intolerance has suddenly exploded in our faces			1
anti-war protesters have been assaulted in the streets by right - wing hooligans			0
people were reportedly fired from their jobs because of critical remarks they made on their private @entity93 accounts			0
and social media was flooded with racist , nationalistic and exceptionally brutal and callous content , which was then spread to tens of thousands of @entity8			1
several weeks ago a university professor in @entity97 emailed his students to say he hoped that their families , whoever they might be , would be safe during these dark times			0
this simple act of kindness was enough for the dean of the faculty to try to have the professor apologize to his students , some of whom claimed to have been offended by his words			0
failing to make a distinction between the value of @entity8 and @entity79 blood is apparently enough to contravene the values of @entity8 academia and cause a public scandal in @entity8 in 2014			1
@entity116 , an @entity8 human rights organization , was concerned that @entity8 media never mentioned the names of the @entity79 victims of @entity8 's offensive			1
so they produced a paid advertisement listing the names and ages of some of the children who had been killed in @entity11			2
but the @entity8 broadcasting authority refused to air it , on the grounds that it was " politically controversial "			2
the list of examples could go on and on			0
but the biggest problem is not the marginal extremist who cheers for the killing of @entity79 children in @entity11 , or applauds every @entity8 bomb that falls on a private residence			1
the biggest problem is the @entity8 mainstream , which spoke with one voice during this war , and which had zero tolerance for any kind of dissent , or even the simplest human compassion with @entity79 sacrifice , suffering and bloodshed			1
it is all about dehumanization			0
as long as @entity8 do n't perceive @entity79 as equal human beings , there will never be a real solution			1
unfortunately , dehumanizing the @entity79 has become the best tool to strengthen the occupation , to ignore and deny its crimes and enable the @entity8 to live in peace , without any moral dilemmas			1
if the @entity79 are not human beings , there is no question about human rights			1
this process climaxed in this war and this is the real basis for the moral blindness which has covered @entity8			2
one of @entity8 's greatest assets -- as well as the source of its greatest pride -- has been our liberal , democratic and free society			1
but what we 're doing to ourselves now is a greater threat to our existence than @entity174 ' rockets could ever be			0
@entity8 likes to describe itself as " the only democracy in the @entity176 , " but it 's really only a democracy for its @entity180 citizens who are quick to fall in line with the mainstream every time @entity8 tanks roll across the border			1
it may not have always been this way , but i fear that this new phenomenon is here to stay			0
there is no one to stop it			0
the @entity8 media , commercial and free , is collaborating with it ; the legal and legislative systems are stepping back , and so is the political system			2
we will carry the scars of this summer with us from now on			0
the people who were too afraid to speak out against @entity8 aggression this time around wo n't be any more likely to stand up next time			2
can you think of any worse news out of @entity8 ?			2

@entity201 : unprecedented cracks in @entity8 's democracy have been revealed after month of @entity11 conflict
@entity201 : biggest problem is @entity8 mainstream 's failure to tolerate dissenting voices
@entity201 : many @entity8 no longer perceive @entity79 as equal human beings
@entity201 : dehumanization allows @entity8 to strengthen its occupation and deny @entity79 rights
