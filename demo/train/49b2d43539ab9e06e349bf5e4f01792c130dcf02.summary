-- i 'm a @entity2 mom who works outside the home , and i 've always felt strongly that women who have a choice about whether to work or stay home after having children should feel completely comfortable with either decision			1
should a mom choose to work , her children will be fine as long as there 's a good child care situation in place			2
you know the mantra , " happy mommy ( who wants to work ) , happy baby			2
" based on that thinking , i have to say i was fairly blown away when i read one of the top findings of a new report by @entity24 , which examined the attitudes of millennials ( born 1981 to 2000 ) , @entity2 ( 1965 to 1980 ) and baby boomers ( 1946 to 1964 )			1
millennials scored highest , over @entity28 and baby boomers , when asked whether they believe one parent should stay home to care for the children : sixty percent of millennials said yes , vs. 55 % for boomers and 50 % for gen @entity34			1
what ? are we moving in the wrong direction here , ladies ? are we harkening back to an " @entity42 " time when mom stayed at home , dad worked , and that was the complete family story ? what millennial women want now @entity46 , editorial director of @entity24 , says no. she points to what else the millennials said in the survey of more than 2,000 moms and dads : that both parents should make a significant contribution to the household income , that mothers and fathers should share equally in daily household activities and that a mom who works outside the home sets a positive example for the children			1
" i think many men and women want ... the ability to step in and out of their careers and not be stigmatized for it , and i think the millennials are saying this , too , " said @entity46 , who notes that most millennials currently have children who are younger than those of of @entity28 and baby boomers			1
" many men and women want to stay home with that little guy in the first years , " she added			1
they 're saying " somebody should be home with that little tiny baby , but they do want a career			2
" in conversations with millennial moms across the country , i was struck by how much they believe the decision to work or stay at home is personal rather than political , how many would stay at home if they could and how they do n't seem to feel the pressures of feminism driving their decisions			2
they are charting their own course			0
moms ' opting in ' to find work doors shut @entity95 , 33 , president and chief executive officer of her own public relations firm , has two sons , ages 8 and 11			0
she 's done it all : stayed at home when the boys were young , worked part - time and consulted during their preschool years and now works full - time from home , which means she can be there when her sons get off the school bus			2
" i feel like it 's a very personal decision , " @entity108 said			0
" in a perfect world , with all the variables being aligned , who would n't want to be home every day ? ... but that 's not the world we live in			2
" @entity115 , 25 , who works in sales for a television station in @entity118 , @entity119 , says she or her husband could probably stay home with their 2 - year - old daughter , but that would n't support the kind of lifestyle they want for their family			1
" i think it 's great if a parent can stay home , " @entity128 said , " but there are a lot of situations where it 's just not feasible to be able to do that			1
i know specifically in our situation , we do have to have both parents working to be able to afford beyond just our basic needs			0
" brace yourself , @entity140 : millennials move back home @entity144 's feelings are influenced by her own mom , who did n't work			1
" i always had the image of me being like her and staying home , " said @entity144 , 30 , who works in the e-learning field in @entity147 , @entity148 , and has a 2 - year - old daughter			2
" but i really feel like things have changed a lot , " she added			0
" i do n't want to stay home and never be able to go out to dinner and never be able to go on vacation			1
" for @entity157 , a 31 - year - old mom with a 2 - year - old boy in day care , the issue is clear - cut : she thinks a parent should be home with the child , and she wishes it could be her			1
" i think that 's the best thing for my child , " said @entity157 , an account manager in the cosmetics industry in @entity164 , @entity165			0
" i feel like he misses out on time with myself , my husband			0
... there are times he needs @entity140 , and i 'm just not able to go			0
" i wondered whether the views of millennials on this question of whether one parent should be home with a child were influenced either by their own upbringing as children of dual - income @entity34 and boomers or by the experiences of people they know			1
@entity188 , 24 , whose daughter is just 8 weeks old , said her views are definitely shaped a bit by the childhood of some of her friends			0
" i have some older friends who ... had to stay in day care , or they had to come home by themselves " when they were older , @entity188 said			2
the @entity199 , @entity200 , woman believes that one parent should stay home with the child if they can afford it			1
" i mean , they turned out fine , but they always talked about how much they wished they had more time with their parents			0
" survey : reluctant breadwinner moms are less happy beyond the question of working versus staying at home as parents , millennials told us something else in this survey : that they are a whole lot happier than previous generations ( @entity222 )			1
they reported more satisfaction with their jobs , their family finances and their relationship with their partners than @entity34 and baby boomers			1
" i think we 're more motivated towards achieving satisfaction and balance , " @entity108 said			0
" i do n't think it 's only about making money			0
i believe it 's more about fulfillment : feeling like we 're making a difference and making sure that everything from home to work , those needs are being satisfied , and i think that 's what 's making us happier			2
" many millennial moms say they are thankful to the women who came before them , the @entity28 and baby boomers , who broke down barriers , allowing them to make the choices they want to make for their lives			1
but at the same time , they do n't seem to feel any of the pressures of fulfilling anyone 's expectations other than their own			0
" we do things more according to what we see fit for our family , what 's best for the family , rather than what other people think about it , " @entity188 said			0
@entity46 , of @entity265 , believes that this optimism on the part of millennials has definite implications for the workplace			0
" they 're going to demand more			0
they 're already asking questions about the 24/7 always on ( work life ) , " said @entity46 , herself a gen @entity272			0
" they 're asking for flexibility already as a given , and you know what , they 're not even asking for it			0
" from this gen @entity272 as well , amen indeed ! do you think one parent should stay home to care for the children ? @entity290 in below in the comments or tell @entity292 on @entity293 and @entity294 on @entity295 .			1
