@entity0 , @entity1 -- every year , beginning in april , @entity1 's government urges its citizens to " @entity5 " -- the @entity1 word for " remember			1
" to remember the hundreds of thousands of lives lost during the country 's 1994 genocide			1
but all @entity10 wants to do is to forget			1
the 36 - year - old 's entire family was slaughtered during that dark period in her small @entity16 country 's history			1
the massacre saw @entity19 militias and civilians alike murder vast numbers of members of the @entity25 ethnic minority : men , women and children , many of whom had been their neighbors before the conflict began			1
the killings finally came to an end 100 days later , when @entity34 ( @entity34 ) troops , led by @entity36 , defeated the @entity19 rebels and took control of the country			1
to @entity10 the end of the war also meant an end to the repeated , brutal rapes she had been forced to endure at the hands of many different men			1
" wherever we used to go and meet a roadblock at least two would rape you and release you , " she tells @entity2			2
" some could let you go and others would hold you for longer			0
" the genocide left @entity10 emotionally and physically scarred , @entity52 + and pregnant			1
she was just 16 years old			2
community members gave her shelter and she says some of the women told her they would help her with the abortion she so desperately requested			2
but as time passed , she knew they had lied to her			0
then , the labor pains came			2
@entity10 says it was some time before she could finally look at her newborn baby girl , who she named @entity61			1
and 20 years on , @entity10 says her daughter 's birthday is still a source of pain to her			1
" i never remember the birthday of my child because there was nothing good about it , " she says			0
" i have never celebrated her birthday because most of the times i never want to remember it			0
" @entity61 mirrors her mother 's pain			1
seated on a wooden chair in their small living room , she fiddles with a bead bracelet on her wrist			0
her lips tremble as she tries to bare her soul to us			0
" i was born going through all bad things , so i feel that i do n't really care about my birthday			2
birthdays are for people who are happy only , " she says			0
" it 's painful - it hurts me , i always ask myself and i lose all my courage			2
i ask myself why i existed			0
and ask myself why it happened			0
and i feel that i am not worth anything			0
it makes me so sad , " she cries			0
@entity10 says she loves her daughter and would do anything for her , but at times she feels that her daughter is a constant , painful reminder of the horrors she went through two decades ago			1
" within thirty minutes my heart can change and i feel bad against her in my heart , " she says			0
" whenever i see her , i remember so many things			0
" @entity10 unscrews a plastic bottle containing anti-retroviral tablets ( @entity107 )			1
the medicine , taken twice daily , is helping her stave off the worst symptoms of hiv / aids			0
" during the genocide , the militia deliberately infected women with @entity52 , " @entity111 , co-ordinator at the @entity112 ( @entity113 ) , explains			1
at the @entity113 headquarters in @entity0 , genocide survivors with hiv / aids line up to receive @entity120			2
most have similar stories to @entity10			1
passed on from attacker to attacker , they contracted the @entity126 virus			0
for them , this is the legacy of the genocide			2
" it was a plan , " says @entity10			2
" their aim was to make genocide carry on			0
" but @entity61 is determined to unchain herself from the dark past			1
instead she dreams of a brighter future			1
" i want to be a very important person , " she says			0
" to help people in similar situations as me , vulnerable people like orphans , and also to be a minister			0

@entity1 genocide took place 20 years ago : @entity19 militia massacred members of the @entity25 ethnic minority
many of those who survived the carnage were left scarred ; rape was used as a *weapon* , *spreading* @entity52
@entity10 's daughter @entity61 was born as a *result* of rape ; two decades on this still pains both of them
but @entity61 is determined to dream of a brighter future for herself and her country
