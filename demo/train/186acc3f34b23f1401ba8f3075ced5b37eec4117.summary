@entity0 -- @entity2 do n't usually pay a lot of attention to @entity6 politics , but the election of 2004 proved an exception			1
the election that occurred sunday should be a second			0
the election of 2004 was seen as a referendum on the @entity13 war			0
sunday 's election could be seen as a referendum on the euro - elites who so strongly opposed that war			1
the conservatives who governed @entity6 in 2004 had strongly aligned themselves with the @entity2 after the 9/11 attacks			1
in 2003 - 2004 , @entity6 prime minister @entity21 gained the limelight -- and endured abuse -- as @entity25 's most prominent ally on the @entity27 continent			1
@entity21 joined the @entity13 war and cooperated strongly with @entity2 counterterrorism efforts			0
@entity21 was swept from power in the election of march 2004 , in an election overshadowed by a terrible terrorist attack three days beforehand : a bombing of @entity35 's central railway station that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800			0
@entity21 's replacement , @entity38 , ended the @entity6 commitment to @entity13 and sundered the close relationship with the @entity2			1
he introduced same - sex marriage to @entity6 and granted amnesty to 750,000 illegal aliens			1
he engaged in flashy diplomatic maneuvers with @entity45 and against @entity46			0
yet even as he jabbed aggressively at hot - button issues , @entity38 was visibly befuddled by @entity6 's gathering economic challenges			1
indeed for a long time , @entity38 seemed not to comprehend that @entity6 faced any economic challenges at all			1
i made a couple of visits to @entity6 during the early @entity38 years			1
the officials i talked to then seemed almost giddy with optimism			0
for centuries , @entity6 had lagged behind the rest of @entity27 economically			1
now at last the economy was surging			0
in the early 2000s , average living standards caught up to those of @entity60 ; if @entity6 ( they said ) continued to grow at current rates , it would catch up to @entity64 within the decade			2
@entity6 created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of @entity27 in the years between 2000 and 2005			2
how ? now we come to the fine print			0
if you looked closely , the @entity6 economy of the 2000s was a very sick puppy			2
@entity6 had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s			1
the currency launched in 2002			0
signing up for a monetary union with @entity78 created a temporary illusion of wealth for the people of @entity6			2
the @entity78 economy is much more productive than the @entity6 economy			2
one way a less productive economy can adjust its trade is by allowing its currency to depreciate			0
the advent of the euro deprived @entity6 of that option			1
instead , the price of @entity78 goods and services steadily declined inside @entity6			2
result : between 2002 and the onset of recession in 2008 , the @entity6 trade deficit tripled , from 3 % of @entity97 in 2002 to more than 10 % in 2008			1
you might wonder : wait a minute ! if the price of @entity78 goods and services declined inside @entity6 , then logically the price of @entity6 goods and services ( including vacations ) must have risen to @entity78			2
so how did @entity6 finance its @entity78 buying boom ? answer : the same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from @entity78 also cut the cost of borrowing money from @entity78			1
the euro did to the @entity78 - @entity6 economic relationship exactly what @entity112 's currency manipulation has done to the @entity2 - @entity112 relationship			1
between 2002 and 2008 , @entity6 households went on a borrowing binge			2
they used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes			0
through the 2000s , @entity6 built houses at a rate of 700,000 a year - more than @entity123 , @entity78 and @entity64 combined			2
@entity6 built shopping malls and office buildings to match			2
by 2008 , construction accounted for a staggering 16 % of the @entity6 economy			1
and all of it was financed by debt : @entity6 households accumulated debt equal to 90 % of @entity97 ( only slightly less than @entity2 households at the top of the housing bubble ) , and @entity6 businesses had accumulated debt equal to 205 % of @entity97 ( vastly more than @entity2 business has ever borrowed )			1
@entity2 well - understand how this game ends			0
one day , the market loses faith that housing values must endlessly rise			0
as debtors scramble to service their debts , they cut back their buying of goods and services			0
that causes a recession , which causes asset values to tumble more , which causes debts to go into default -- and the whole economy painfully unwinds			0
@entity6 now faces nearly 22 % unemployment -- @entity160 levels -- and staggering government deficits			1
the government must cut to balance its books if it is to remain within the euro , but government cutbacks only make it that much more difficult for households and business to service their debts			0
@entity38 slunk out of town a little while ago			0
good riddance to the man who boorishly insulted the @entity2 flag at the @entity6 national day parade in 2003 to score a point with the left wing of his political party			0
@entity6 's conservatives scored a crushing victory in the sunday vote , as the @entity6 people try any desperate measure to restore their lost prosperity			1
but it will take more than an election to do the job			0
it will take a grand rethink of the whole euro currency project , a rethink that either emancipates @entity6 to quit the euro and export enough to repay its debts or else reduces the debt enough that @entity6 can sustain its expensive new currency			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			0

@entity194 : elections in @entity6 were a victory for conservatives
he says @entity6 economic boom was financed by huge debts
unemployment now tops 20 % , and the euro *handicaps* @entity6 , he says
@entity207 : rethinking the @entity208 is key to *solving* @entity6 's problems
