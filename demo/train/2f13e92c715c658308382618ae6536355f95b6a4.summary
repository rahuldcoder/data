-- members of the @entity4 military may have been involved in the torture of two men in the country 's province of @entity9 , a government official said on friday			1
the incident came to light after a video surfaced showing men burning the genitals of a naked and bound man , and holding a knife to the nose and neck of another bound man on a dusty road while interrogating them			0
" the investigation is still going on but initial reports i received from the armed forces commander , show that there were elements of the military who were involved in those excessive , unprofessional acts , that were clearly a violation of human rights , @entity4 coordinating minister for political and security affairs @entity32 told @entity0			1
the video is believed to be from the @entity4 province of @entity9 , nearly 3,500 kilometers east of the capital , @entity36			2
@entity9 has long had a low - level insurgency that demands independence from @entity4 , saying the government is trying to take its land to steal resources			1
but both victims in this case were unarmed farmers , the @entity44 students told @entity0			1
the scenes were recorded on a cell phone , and the imagery brought stiff condemnation from human rights groups who believe the video is possible evidence of @entity4 armed forces torturing members of independence movements			1
human rights groups say that while they have n't determined the authenticity of the video , they have clues that the persecutors are members of the @entity4 armed forces			1
for example , the weapon being used in the video appears to be a standard military issue and the questions posed by the interrogators are consistent with those of @entity4 security forces , said @entity71 , deputy director of @entity74 's @entity73 division			0
@entity74 is concerned that the government will let the case linger without a resolution			0
another video surfaced this year showing a disemboweled @entity80 political activist being taunted by men in police uniforms			0

they said he was injured in a firefight , and no officer has been disciplined in that incident			0
the indigenous @entity92 was established in 1965 to push for the secession of @entity9 from @entity4			0
the group disputed the terms under which @entity9 became a part of @entity4 that year			2
@entity9 has the largest gold mine in the world , operated by the @entity100 - based @entity99 & @entity101 , but members of the freedom movement say locals have not received fair economic benefits from any of the mining operations on their homeland .			2
