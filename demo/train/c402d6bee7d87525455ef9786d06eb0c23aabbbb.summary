-- when @entity3 officials arrive at the next round of nuclear talks in @entity6 on may 23 , they will seek to advance several of their own goals , while only making modest changes to their nuclear program			1
@entity11 's goal is to engage with the @entity12			1
although the meeting will involve six world powers -- @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , the @entity19 , @entity20 and the @entity12 -- it is the only venue it has to speak to @entity12 officials			2
' detailed proposal ' emerging at @entity3 nuclear talks any breakthrough in talks with @entity27 might help ease mounting tensions with @entity12 's allies in the @entity30 , including the @entity31 and even @entity32			1
furthermore , it will ease voices inside @entity3 that oppose talks with the @entity12 , without whose consensus @entity3 will be unable to shift the direction of its nuclear program			1
@entity3 wants to get @entity27 to accept it is a player in @entity30 politics			1
this grants it leverage to negotiate new terms of agreement over its nuclear activities			0
in return , @entity11 will offer solutions to its conflicts with the @entity12 in the region			1
unlike the @entity12 , @entity11 currently supports the @entity53 regime and will aim to ensure that a future @entity53 government will protect @entity3 regional interests			1
@entity3 supports @entity57 @entity56 against the @entity12 - backed @entity58			1
@entity3 supports @entity6 's @entity60 government , which makes @entity61 the only @entity63 country in the @entity64 to have closer ties with @entity3 than with @entity12 's @entity63 allies			1
@entity3 also aims to keep @entity32 at arm 's length			2
it likes to portray @entity32 hostility as a case of simple regional rivalry rather than one based on the real threat of a nuclear @entity3			1
ongoing talks allows it to maintain just enough transparency over its nuclear program to make the case that it is not fear of a nuclear @entity3 which prompts @entity32 hostility , but the fact that it is capable of counter-balancing @entity32 power in the region			2
@entity3 will therefore insist in the talks what @entity32 refuses to accept , that all states must join the @entity84 , eliminate existing nuclear weapons stockpiles and have the right to develop peaceful nuclear energies			1
another goal @entity11 will pursue is to demand that the tightening sanctions regime be loosened			2
an @entity3 - based journal , @entity91 , suggests that @entity3 could cap its uranium enrichment at 3.5 percent -- a grade that can be used for nuclear power but not for nuclear weapons -- in exchange for easing sanctions			2
@entity3 could also propose first to dispose of its extra 20 percent enriched uranium , which it claims is produced for medicinal purposes			0
that is presuming that the @entity3 claim to have the capacity to produce in abundance the higher - grade fuel is correct			0
the article underscored a political reality that @entity12 diplomats have already experienced : @entity3 will never agree to cease enrichment altogether or give its enriched uranium away			1
in fact , president @entity110 never said @entity3 would , but the message was lost in translation when it was told in @entity114			0
that was because the @entity116 refused to admit a hard dose of reality when it was injected by @entity120 's controversial figure			0
just as it refuses to accept that @entity3 's nuclear policy is not determined by its presidents but by a higher body of decision - makers , which means that regardless of who leads the country the nature of its nuclear program will not change unless its demands are met			1
@entity3 is buying time without altering its questionable behaviors over its nuclear and regional policies			2
but the signs are clear that @entity11 is committed to engagement to meet its desired goals			1
@entity3 's goal is to use delay tactics to arrive at some " soft compromises " in the talks			0
these include getting the @entity12 to convince @entity32 to cease threatening @entity3 over its nuclear program , which has created tensions inside @entity3			1
it also includes convincing the @entity12 to permanently recognize @entity3 's enrichment program and to agree to ease the sanctions			1
in short , @entity3 is in the mood for what it calls " resistance diplomacy			0
" this means , in the process of talks , it will continue to exercise patience to wear out the @entity12 resolve to confront it			2
in the best case , @entity3 hopes to leave the talks feeling assured that its immediate security concerns have been sufficiently addressed			0
that explains @entity3 's recent accommodating stance towards the talks , which , according to former @entity3 deputy foreign minister @entity158 , has the full blessing of the supreme leader			0
in the worst case , @entity3 will continue using its regional influence and enrichment program to obtain future concessions			2
@entity3 will then use the next presidential race in june 2013 to revamp the nuclear talks by instilling in the @entity116 the false hope that a new presidential figure might be able to alter the course of @entity3 's nuclear program , which will not happen , again , unless its security concerns are addressed			0
the best choice right now is to play the same game with @entity3 , by engaging it with the same patience			2
at the same time , @entity27 must recognize that any change @entity11 will introduce will be measured against a host of demands that it will make to ensure regime security			0
therefore , in the process of talks , threatening @entity11 with military action is counter-productive			0
and while sanctions are useful tools , they must be adjusted to loosen to any constructive change @entity3 makes and tighten if @entity3 is unaccommodating			0
the alternative is risking entering into a protracted conflict with @entity3			0
@entity11 's choice to pick @entity6 as the next venue for the may talks reveals a final goal : to unnerve the world by reminding it that only a decade ago @entity61 was invaded on charges of possessing weapons of mass destruction			0
the current threat of war against @entity3 for fear that it could possess nuclear weapons may risk repeating the consequences of the @entity61 invasion in 2003			0
the @entity61 invasion brought about civil strife in the country , and increased the @entity3 influence in the region .			0

@entity207 says @entity3 wants engagement with the @entity12
she says @entity3 wants the @entity12 to accept @entity3 as a regional player
says there are clear signs @entity11 is committed to engagement to *achieve* its goals
she says the @entity12 should engage but with patience
