-- it rarely makes sense to draw big conclusions or make public policy on the basis of anecdotes			1
but the plural of " anecdote " is data , and sometimes one - off events are useful in crystallizing lessons to guide policymakers and inform the public			2
so it was with the @entity16 - area rampage this week in which a teenager bearing two kitchen knives is accused of injuring 21 high school classmates and a security guard -- but none of them were killed			2
it 's hard to imagine an anecdote that better illustrates what decades of data show : that for purposes of life and death , the weapon matters			1
it 's called " the instrumentality effect , " and we owe the original scholarly findings ( more than four decades old at this point ) to the eminent @entity35 criminologist @entity34			0
others , including one of us ( @entity38 ) , have validated and built upon his insights			0
the idea that the weapon matters emerges in studies of robberies and assaults			1
when committed with a gun , these crimes are far more likely to result in the victim 's death than are similar violent crimes committed without a gun			1
for example , the likelihood that a victim will die when robbed by a firearm - wielding attacker is three times as high as when the victim faces an attacker bearing a knife and 10 times as high as when the attacker has another type of weapon			0
for victims injured in an assault , the likelihood of death is also greater when a gun is involved , especially in cases of domestic violence			2
of course , the choice of weapon could be simply a product of the perpetrator 's focus on killing ; perhaps it 's this intensity , not the choice of weapon , that is really to blame			0
in light of wednesday 's knife attacks in @entity81 , @entity78 's findings are particularly telling			1
to separate the effects of the weapon vs. the intent of the perpetrator , he looked at fatality rates for different calibers of guns			0
if perpetrator intent were really to blame , zeroing in on attacks with guns would " control " for that effect			0
@entity34 found , as the instrumentality perspective would predict , that people shot by larger caliber guns -- which carry bigger and more destructive bullets -- were more likely to die than those shot by smaller caliber guns			0
adding more evidence to the case that the weapon matters , @entity34 and @entity105 later demonstrated that overall crime rates are n't that much higher in @entity108 cities than in comparable cities in other developed countries			1
we just have higher rates of homicide , and that is because our criminals are more likely to be armed with guns and thus their attacks are more likely to end in the victim 's death			1
the most important and interesting implication of the instrumentality effect is that if public policy could reduce gun use in crime , the murder rate would go down -- even if the overall crime rate did not			1
as it turns out , about half of @entity108 states have enacted policies that add prison time to felons who use a gun when committing their crimes			2
these so - called sentencing enhancements , most of which were adopted in the 1970s and 1980s , were intended to reduce the use of guns in violent acts			0
scholarly evaluations based on data , not anecdotes , offer some evidence that these policy innovations have been effective			0
this week 's tragedy ca n't help but invoke memories of the mass shooting at @entity148 some 16 months ago			0
the difference today is that , because the @entity153 , @entity81 , perpetrator chose to use knives , victims ' families can look forward to a future with their loved ones -- instead of planning their funerals .			1

*authors* : injury , not death , came from school *stabbings* in @entity81
they say *research* has long found for purposes of life and death , the weapon matters
*writers* : deaths from gun attacks higher than those from knives , other weapons
if public policy led to reduction in gun use in crimes , murder rate would go down , they say
