-- back in the summer of 1999 , along with thousands of other @entity3 twenty - somethings , i set out on a post-collegiate backpacking trip through @entity5			1
while on a train from @entity7 to @entity8 , i looked across the aisle and spotted another solo female traveler			2
like me , she had a large @entity3 flag sewn to the top of her backpack			1
" where in @entity3 are you from ? " i asked , happy to be sharing the long journey with a fellow poutine eater			1
but something was n't right			0
she began to squirm and would n't look me in the eye			0
" @entity21 , @entity22 , " she said			0
after a bit of interrogation , she came clean			0
she was actually from @entity25 -- close enough to her northern neighbor that her accent would n't immediately alert suspicion , but far enough away , culturally speaking , that her attempt at deception was doomed to wither beneath the suffocatingly courteous inquiry of a curious @entity31			0
eight hours is a long time to try to fool a @entity3 into thinking you 're one of the tribe			1
@entity36 a thing of the past ? in 1999 , my @entity39 train mate 's attempts to deceive were somewhat forgivable			1
the @entity39 military was hot and heavy in @entity42			0
@entity36 were n't looked upon favorably in many international quarters			1
but do today 's @entity36 still feel the need to jack the @entity3 flag while traveling abroad ? i would n't have thought so			1
after all , these days it 's the @entity47 who are being called " the new ugly @entity36			1
" yet according to @entity3 flight booking website @entity50 , pretending to be @entity3 by wearing that glorious red maple leaf still gets @entity36 better service when they 're abroad , provided they 're able to act the part , too			1
in honor of @entity56 on july 1 -- remember that date if you want to have a hope in h - e - double - hockey - sticks of fooling anyone -- the @entity63 - based site brought in a body language expert to provide tongue - in - cheek advice on how @entity36 and @entity66 can try to fake their @entity3 - ness			1
" using quintessentially @entity3 symbols , body language and facial expressions is a time - tested way to enhance the travel experience abroad , " says @entity67 , vice president of operations for @entity50			1
" it 's not surprising that travelers from other nations would do their best to come off @entity31			2
" the site commissioned body language expert and author @entity78 of @entity79 to demonstrate " faux @entity81 contortions that immediately betray a ' flag - jacker ' -- be they @entity39 , @entity84 or other			1
" here are a few tips he lays out in the video			2
the maple - o - gy : a @entity3 gesture showing submission by raising the shoulders in an apologetic motion , presenting oneself as nonthreatening			1
the @entity94 : showing the creases around your eyes when smiling -- indicates genuine friendliness			0
the @entity99 : slight tilting of the head when smiling , shows courtesy and congeniality			0
alternately , absence of the gesture can help you spot a fake @entity3			1
stars and gripes forever : @entity109 jutted out , face blank ( or worse , frowning ) , causing the recipient of the message to assume something is wrong before the traveler has spoken			0
@entity115 : a well - meaning but misplaced gesture in which arms are outstretched with palms down , above the heads of others , in an attempt to calm a situation ... a move that usually has the effect of escalating tensions			0
the polka - loon : overdoing friendly head tilt in a manner that implies you might need pharmaceutical assistance			0
this is all reasonable advice , but body language and @entity3 flags alone wo n't fool anyone			1
if you 're really going to convince people you 're @entity3 , here are two more tips to throw into the mix. say you 're sorry			1
for everything " is it true what they say ? if a @entity3 apologizes three times the maple fairy brings you a hockey puck signed by @entity149 ? " an @entity39 friend recently asked me this when i sent him an email apologizing multiple times for being unable to make it to a planned dinner			1
joke all you like , we 're proud of our reputation for extreme politeness			0
when two @entity3 accidentally bump into one another , a bizarre ritual often ensues			2
no matter who 's at fault , both parties will apologize			2
if you stick out your leg and trip me , i 'll say " sorry " to you			0
after all , i could have hurt your foot			0
" did you know he 's @entity3 ? " when a celebrity comes from the @entity172 , no @entity3 can resist pointing it out to non-canadians who might be within earshot			2
when @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 or @entity185 come up in conversation , you 'll see us fidget and grow visibly agitated till we have a chance to blurt out " did you know he / she is from @entity3 ! ? " study this list of famous @entity3 before you hit the road			2
shout out their nationality proudly to whoever is listening when they appear on tv or their music is played			0
you 'll fit right in			0
the only exception is when discussions turn to @entity201 or @entity202			0
you @entity36 can claim them as your own if you 'd like			2
happy @entity56 ! @entity206 is a @entity3 @entity0 digital producer based in @entity208			2
most people assume she is @entity39 until she says the word " about			0
