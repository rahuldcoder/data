@entity0 , @entity1 -- watching the news out of @entity4 is causing a case of déjà vu for dr. @entity7			2
the sight of people wearing masks became common in @entity0 after the @entity12 outbreak of 2003			1
" seeing the people in masks today reminds me of @entity0 during @entity12 , " said @entity7 , an epidemiology expert who was among those on the frontline during the outbreak of @entity12 in @entity0 in 2003 , which within three months infected 8,000 and killed nearly 800 in @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
historically , @entity0 has been center stage for recent infections that threatened to spiral across the world , such as @entity12 and @entity23 , which first struck and killed people here in 1997			1
@entity1 -- with the close proximity of its rural agriculture to population centers and globally connected transportation -- has been an ideal conduit for past animal diseases that spread to humans and then to the rest of the world			0
but with the outbreak of swine flu in @entity4 and the @entity37 , @entity0 suddenly finds the world looking to it for lessons on how to stop the spread of disease			1
" managing a ( potential ) pandemic ca n't be from the top down , it must be from the ground up , " said @entity7 , a former @entity0 legislator representing the medical community			1
in the early days of @entity12 , cooperation was lax between @entity0 health officials and public officials across the border in mainland @entity1 , where the live animal wet markets in @entity53 province is suspected in the virus ' jump to humans			2
" one of the most important lesson of @entity12 was the importance of good communication , " says dr. @entity57 , head of the microbiology department of @entity59 , which found the first human cases of @entity23 in 1997 and first identified @entity12 in 2003			1
" there were outbreaks in the middle to late november in @entity53 , but the first cases were reported in @entity0 three months later , " he said			2
" we could have reduced the impact ( of @entity12 ) if there had been better communication " between @entity0 and mainland @entity1 health authorities			1
the communication channels have improved between @entity1 and @entity0 , health officials said , as well as better surveillance of the disease			2
every visitor who comes through @entity80 now is scanned by infrared monitors and immediately isolated if suffering from a fever or respiratory illness			0
" quarantine and isolation of people ( suspected to be ill ) is crucial now , " @entity57 said			0
as the disease spreads , there is a conflict between the need for a quick response and the time required for appropriate scientific study -- which can result in some bad decisions , @entity57 said			0
for example , in the case of @entity12 health experts wore full - body protection suits because of initial hunches the disease was being spread by airborne causes			0
more people were exposed to the disease because of the harried medical staff 's improper use of the cumbersome equipment			0
" it turned out globes , masks and hand washing were far more effective " than a breathing apparatus , @entity57 said			0
" @entity111 are dangerous , " he added			0
if @entity0 is any example , governments who fail to meet the challenges of an outbreak will face rising public heat			0
in july 2003 , half a million @entity0 residents took to the streets to protest the government , in part because of frustrations over the response to the @entity12 outbreak , says @entity125 , director of the @entity126 at @entity59 -- adding to the woes of the already beleaguered administration of former @entity0 chief executive @entity129 , who later stepped down in the middle of his second five - year appointment .			1
