for the fourth year in a row , @entity1 @entity0 have passed a balanced budget			1
each time , we 've put forward a plan that stops spending money we do n't have , creates jobs with pro-growth reforms , strengthens the safety net , and expands opportunity for all			2
and each time we 've learned a little bit more about where the two parties stand			0
if you look at president @entity17 's budget -- @entity18 refused to write one this year -- it 's clear where he and his party place their trust : @entity23			1
he wants to raise taxes by $ 1.8 trillion -- on top of the $ 1.7 trillion he 's already raised			1
he wants to increase spending by $ 791 billion			1
and he never balances the budget -- ever			2
time and again , the president and his party put government in the driver 's seat			2
they want to take more from families to spend more in @entity23			1
whether it 's health care , energy , or taxes , democrats want the federal government to play a bigger role in the lives of @entity44 and our economy			2
and that 's great for @entity23 ; it thrives on more power			1
but the @entity44 people will lose out			2
they 'll face less opportunity , more debt , and fewer jobs			0
by contrast , @entity1 @entity0 have put forward a plan that puts our trust in the people			1
our plan balances the budget in just 10 years			2
we cut $ 5.1 trillion in spending over the next decade by eliminating waste and making much - needed reforms			1
the nonpartisan @entity64 says the deficit reduction in our budget will grow the economy			2
under our plan , in 2024 , economic output will be 1.8 % greater than it otherwise would be			0
that works out to about $ 1,100 per person			0
a quick reality check for the critics and big spenders in @entity23 : on the current path , the federal government will spend roughly $ 48 trillion over the next 10 years			1
by contrast , this budget will spend nearly $ 43 trillion			1
on the current path , spending will grow , on average , by 5.2 % a year			0
under our budget , spending will grow , on average , by 3.5 % a year			1
nearly $ 43 trillion is enough			1
increasing spending by 3.5 % instead of 5.2 % is hardly draconian			0
responsible spending restraint is just one part of our plan			0
we also call for pro-growth tax reform and greater energy production			0
we repeal @entity89 and clear the way for patient - centered reforms			0
we protect and strengthen @entity92			0
we repair the safety net so it 's there for those who need it , and we give states the flexibility they need to help people move up the ladder of life			1
our budget will root out cronyism , because we believe the @entity44 people deserve a level playing field			1
in fact , we eliminate $ 7 billion of corporate welfare within the @entity108 alone			0
we want the best and brightest to lead the way			0
businesses should n't succeed because of the connections they have in @entity23			2
they should succeed based on the value they generate and the jobs they create			0
we can expand opportunity by empowering people , not bureaucrats			0
all of these solutions would help create jobs			0
instead of sending more money to @entity23 -- instead of funding more @entity123 and racking up more debt -- we return power to the people by cutting tax rates and wasteful spending			1
under our plan , people will spend less time navigating the maze that is @entity23 and more time developing the new ideas that will power our economy			1
so this debate boils down to a question of trust			0
do we trust @entity23 to know what 's best for our health care , our economy , or our families ? or do we trust the people of this country to make an honest assessment about what 's best for their lives ? @entity0 have made our choice			1
we 've put forward a budget that harnesses the power of economic freedom and respects the dignity of every person			0
we trust the @entity44 people to lead our country forward			2
join us on @entity155 / @entity154 .			0
