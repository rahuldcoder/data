in a national title game where most of the pregame focus was on the starting quarterbacks , it was a determined running back who was the star			1
@entity7 sophomore tailback @entity6 continued his record - setting running with 246 yards and four touchdowns as the @entity10 rolled to a 42 - 20 victory over @entity12 in the inaugural @entity14 national championship on monday			1
it was the third consecutive game in which @entity6 ran for more than 200 yards			1
after a record 220 in the @entity18 championship in december and a record 230 in the @entity20 on @entity21 , he set a mark for the national title contest ( including the @entity25 title games ) by making @entity12 use multiple players to bring him down			2
and even that did n't always work			0
at a school that produced the only two - time @entity31 winner -- @entity32 -- and many other star running backs like @entity34 and @entity35 , only @entity6 has rushed for 200 + yards in back - to - back - to - back games			1
" we knew ( coming into the game ) that our o - line was bigger and more physical than their d - line , and we just had to punch them in the mouth , " he said , referring to his blockers			0
" the line came out and played their butts off			0
they paved the way for me			0
" @entity12 vs. @entity7 : score , reaction from 2015 @entity54 he told @entity4 's @entity56 all he had to do was to run through the holes his line opened and break a couple of tackles			1
" i give all the credit to my boys , " he said			0
" i knew that we were going to be unstoppable			0
" @entity12 head coach @entity65 gave @entity6 credit but also pointed to the big guys who blocked for him			1
" he is an exceptional player as is their offensive line , " @entity65 told reporters			0
" a lot of credit to ( all ) those guys			0
" @entity7 head coach @entity74 , who became the second coach to win national titles at multiple schools , said @entity6 is the most underrated running back in the country			1
" he 's one of the best post-contact yard guys i have ever been around , " he said			0
the quarterback duel between @entity31 winner @entity82 of @entity12 and @entity83 , who only became @entity7 's starter in their 13th game of the season due to an injury , was a bit of a stalemate			1
@entity82 had more passing yards ( 333 ) and two @entity91 passes to one for @entity83 , but the @entity7 quarterback also helped steady his team , particularly in the first half , with some key runs			1
his receivers struggled to get open early but the young @entity10 ' offensive line eventually overpowered their @entity99 ' defensive counterparts as the game wore on and @entity12 wore down			2
that meant open holes for @entity6 to exploit and time for @entity83 to throw			2
@entity7 ( 14 - 1 ) overcame four turnovers , including two mistakes that led to 10 points in the second half as @entity12 ( 13 - 2 ) closed an 11 - point halftime deficit to just one			1
but @entity12 could n't stop @entity6 , who carried the ball 36 times			2
@entity74 said he would never have imagined after spring practice that his team would have been in the national title game			0
" but i did n't quite understand the improvement these guys could make , " he said , also thinking back to early in the season when @entity7 was embarrassed by a home loss to a @entity118 team that ended up in the @entity119			1
@entity82 , who would likely be a top pick in the @entity121 should he choose to leave school early , said he was going to take a " couple of days " to make a decision on whether to stay			2
" obviously ( losing ) hurts , ( and ) i 'm sure it 'll weigh in a little bit but there 's a lot of other things that have to play into that decision , " he said			0
" there 's a lot of other things that could bring me back and not just this loss			2
" @entity133 celebrates @entity134 , @entity135			0

@entity7 held @entity31 winner @entity82 to just two @entity91 passes
the @entity10 had a balanced offense led by running back @entity6 , who scored four touchdowns
