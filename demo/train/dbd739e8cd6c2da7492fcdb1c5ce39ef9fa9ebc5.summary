@entity0 -- president @entity1 said thursday he intends to nominate a top @entity3 police department official to head the @entity4 , the agency charged with protecting airplanes and other forms of transportation from terrorists			1
@entity9 has served as the state 's deputy director of homeland security and a special agent with the @entity14			1
@entity9 currently is the department 's chief of homeland security and intelligence			1
his name had been floated for the federal job earlier this year and was warmly received by unions and airport screeners , who say @entity9 will embrace collective bargaining for screeners			1
now " the question of bargaining rights at @entity4 is not a matter of ' if ' but ' when , ' " said @entity28 , president of the @entity29 , in a statement applauding the choice			0
" we are confident that the appointment of mr. @entity9 as administrator will help put that matter to bed			2
" screeners had an often hostile relationship with the @entity40 administration , which opposed unionization , saying it would hinder the agency 's ability to quickly respond to emergencies			2
the airport 's police department , which @entity9 has helped manage since early 2007 , is the largest such operation in the country , with approximately 1,200 employees			1
his new job would give him much greater responsibilities , managing the @entity4 's roughly 50,000 employees			0
those employees include some 45,000 screeners , known as transportation security officers , who provide security at 450 airports nationwide , and an undisclosed number of federal air marshals -- plainclothes officers tasked with preventing or interrupting hijackings			0
" sorry to see him go , actually , " said @entity62 , president of the @entity63			0
" out of the new management team , i would say he was the most well - received and most well - liked			0
" @entity62 said @entity9 brought more weaponry to the department 's tactical team , increased the focus on intelligence , and had the team train with security forces from @entity75 's @entity74			1
" some of the things that the @entity75 do may just shock the consciousness of the @entity78 , but they are second to none , " @entity62 said			0
" he did step up the game quite a bit			0
" @entity1 's announcement sets in motion a confirmation process that will begin with the @entity86 collecting background information on @entity88			0
a confirmation hearing will come later , after @entity9 is formally nominated			0
homeland security secretary @entity90 on thursday praised @entity1 's choice , saying @entity9 ' " expertise in counterterrorism and airport security will be a great asset to the department			1
" in addition to serving as assistant chief of the @entity99 , @entity9 is associate director at the @entity100 at the @entity101			2
previously , he served as the state 's deputy director of homeland security , and as a police officer with the @entity107 @entity106 and special agent with the @entity14			1
