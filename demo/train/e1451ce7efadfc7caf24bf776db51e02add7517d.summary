editor 's note : this story is part of the @entity5 project , in which the @entity7 community takes on a special skills challenge once a week			2
last weekend 's challenge was to create a time - lapse video that told a local story			1
this weekend , we 're making mini cooking demonstrations			2
@entity14 to @entity7 to join the fun and learn a little something while you 're at it			2
@entity19 was , if you wanted to make a time - lapse film , first you had to build a machine			1
in the late 1920s , @entity22 was an american high school student with a passion for photography and a lot of time on his hands			0
he wanted to capture apple blossoms unfolding over time on film , and he knew he needed to take frequent pictures around the clock , even while he was sleeping or away at school			0
so he wired together a kitchen timer , a camera , a paper clip and a pull cord , and voil√† : photos taken at regular intervals over time and sped back up revealed the beauty of the blooming flowers to the naked eye			0
@entity22 went on to become a pioneer of time - lapse photography , filming incremental changes in flowers and insects , and helping to pave the way for scientific research that still today gains insights from slowed - down views of biology and the physical environment			1
time - lapse is a photographic technique that captures images much more slowly than normal video but plays them back at standard speed , which condenses long periods of time into a relatively short video			1
it 's like " slow motion , seen from the perspective of eternity , " says @entity66 , a film professor at @entity67 in @entity68 who is writing a history of time - lapse			1
( see @entity66 's @entity7 time - lapse of a busy @entity73 lunch			1
) when @entity22 wanted to experiment with time - lapse , he had to build a contraption , but today 's inexpensive digital tools make it easy for almost anyone to give it a try and share their results with the rest of the world			1
all you need is a camera on a tripod , an idea and a healthy dose of patience			0
and a folding chair , recommends @entity91 , an ireporter who took part in a time - lapse challenge on @entity7 last weekend			1
someone has to sit with the camera while it 's filming an extraordinary sunset or clouds moving slowly across a sky			0
see @entity103 ' tips for trying time - lapse dozens of people shared their first time - lapse attempts on @entity7 last weekend			1
@entity108 , who shot a day in the life of a busy @entity111 inlet , said he found time - lapse " surprisingly easy to do			1
" simple instructions for using the movie - making software that comes standard on may computers are just a @entity118 search away			0
@entity119 runs a group dedicated to time - lapses on @entity122 , a video sharing site popular among filmmakers and creative photographers			1
it 's a wildly active group , where inventive new time - lapse videos from across the world pop up every few hours			1
when people first pick up a digital camera and want to try video , " slow motion is the first thing you do , " @entity119 says			0
" time - lapse is the second			2
" what 's the draw ? it 's simple to make magic			0
" i think people are really surprised by the effect , and then it becomes an addiction			0
" another attraction , says artist @entity146 , is that in some ways , time - lapse brings back some of the wonder of analog photography			2
" when people turn a camera on and it 's firing away , there 's a real wonder about what 's going to happen			0
people are so used to looking at the back of the camera now			0
" but with time - lapse , you do n't see the result until you get back home			2
@entity146 is a photographer whose work uses time - lapse and tilt - shift techniques to turn the real world into what looks like meticulous animation			2
his " @entity173 , " a piece shot over three months in @entity175 , @entity176 , tells the story of a helicopter rescue at a busy beach			0
he was looking to cast a place he knows well in a different light			0
when @entity7 asked its community to try time - lapse as part of a weekend assignment series , several participants remarked that it had made them think about the places they live and see every day in a new way			1
see all the @entity7 time - lapse videos " waiting in the cold with my camera made me sensitive to subtle changes in the scene i might normally have missed , " ireporter @entity187 said			1
( watch @entity187 's video of gnat - sized airplanes hopping over the @entity196 , @entity197 , skyline			0
) that 's what it comes down to : " the power of time - lapse , " @entity66 said , is that it " shows you time frames that you ca n't normally perceive			2
when it 's at its best , it shows you the world from another perspective			0

digital cameras and video sharing sites give new life to an old technique
time - lapse offers new perspective on places we see every day
@entity7 challenges its community to try a new skill each weekend
next up : teach a cooking class
