-- @entity1 , one of the most famous film directors in the world , has re-emerged into the zeitgeist this year			1
in august , @entity1 's " @entity6 " displaced " @entity5 " from its perch at the top of the prestigious @entity10 list of the greatest films ever made			1
there also had been renewed interest in " @entity14 " on its 50th anniversary two years ago as well as the release of shiny new blu - ray packages of his films			0
but not all the attention has been flattering			0
in september , @entity22 's film " @entity21 " dramatized @entity24 's behind - the - scenes horror stories from the making of " @entity26 " ( 1963 )			2
according to the movie , @entity1 was obsessed with his protege and sexually abusive			2
and now comes " @entity1 , " an @entity30 wannabe scripted by @entity31 ( " @entity32 " ) and directed by @entity33 ( " @entity35 " ) , with @entity34 as the portly @entity37 master of suspense and @entity39 ( very good ) as " @entity14 " star @entity40			1
( by the way , @entity1 never won an @entity30 -- until the academy sheepishly coughed up a lifetime achievement consolation prize			2
) the movie begins , not unpromisingly , with @entity45 murdering his older brother and @entity1 stepping in to the frame to deliver one of his mordantly witty teasers			2
it 's a cute joke , but it soon turns sour in facile scenes featuring the tormented and delusional hitch confiding to an imaginary @entity45 , presented here as a soul mate , confessor and psychiatrist all rolled into one			0
it 's a terrible idea , and all the more insidious because of the casting : @entity34 ' most famous role remains @entity58 , and " @entity61 " was influenced by @entity45 's macabre penchant for taxidermy			1
certainly , one of the things that makes " @entity14 " such a great film is that it takes this monstrous , deviant figure , @entity66 , and forges a human connection , a slender cord of attraction and empathy between him and @entity40 's character , @entity72			0
for all his eccentricity , @entity73 plays @entity66 as a sensitive , vulnerable , even kindly soul , at the mercy of compulsions he does not comprehend or control			0
@entity1 , through his art , humanized a monster			0
" @entity1 , " on the other hand , chooses to demonize the artist , finding something suspect and distasteful in his pursuit of the @entity45 story -- itself turned into a kind of obsession -- even as it plays the studio head 's dismay for self - congratulatory laughs and cannibalizes @entity94 history			1
in the most ludicrous scene , the director loses all self - control while wielding a prop knife in the vicinity of a naked @entity40 ( no matter that the famous shower scene employed a body double )			2
while @entity34 ' fearful , arrogant , rather pathetic @entity1 seizes on " @entity14 " to persuade himself he 's not over the hill ( after all , in the previous five years he only had " @entity115 , " " @entity6 , " " @entity116 " and " @entity117 " and a couple more masterpieces to his name ) , his long - suffering wife , @entity105 ( @entity106 ) , watches from the sidelines as he mortgages their home , flirts with @entity40 -- his latest blonde -- and pushes back the standards of taste and decency in @entity114 cultural life			1
@entity121 is indulgent , but only up to a point			0
she permits herself to embark on a collaboration with a gallant writer friend ( @entity125 ) , a gesture of artistic independence that @entity1 perceives as infidelity , tantamount to adultery			0
@entity106 's pursed , patient , discreet @entity121 is the real hero of this story			1
she is not just her husband 's sounding board but also his best ( uncredited ) co-writer , his ( uncredited ) editor and even his ( uncredited ) co-director			0
there is probably some sliver of truth to this , but " @entity1 " plays so fast and loose with the facts it 's highly unreliable			1
and in championing the overlooked @entity121 , it not only denigrates @entity1 's reputation but it also slights his many other collaborators , too , including the work of author @entity148 , editor @entity149 and composer @entity150			1
what 's worse , this mild , mediocre act of feminist revisionism seems oblivious to the very real , enduring and profound power of " @entity14 , " which is so much more than just an effective scare machine			0
if you really want to see an honest movie about @entity1 's troubled , fetishistic , conflicted , love - hate relationship with women , see " @entity14 , " " @entity6 , " " @entity163 " or " @entity164 " -- it 's a film he made over and over again his whole life , and better than anyone else ever will .			1
