-- president @entity1 faces a delicate balancing act in trying to contain @entity3 from launching a military strike while compelling @entity5 to halt its nuclear ambition			1
how he plays his hand will be a true test of his ability to pull a rabbit out of a hat			0
meeting with prime minister @entity12 of @entity3 recently , president @entity1 emphasized his strong preference for using sanctions and diplomacy , but he 's not ruling out military force as an option			1
for war to be avoided , @entity5 or @entity3 will have to back down from its current position			1
for the @entity1 administration , the outcome of @entity5 's parliamentary elections provides an opportunity for furthering negotiations			1
seen as a major test for the regime , the march elections resulted in a victory for the ultraconservative factions of supreme leader @entity30			0
president @entity31 , whose supporters did not fare well at the polls , was weakened			0
after several years of internal division , the repudiation of @entity31 consolidates @entity30 's claims of unified support , giving him a freer hand to act and his parties a majority control in the parliament			2
however , many reformists boycotted the elections and candidates supporting @entity31 were disqualified			0
turnout was likely much lower than the 64 % that the government claimed			0
by most independent accounts , the election turnout was among the lowest in @entity5 's history , signaling ebbing support for the hardline leadership			2
@entity5 's election results , along with the strong rhetoric of the hawks from @entity55 , provide the @entity1 administration with a new but narrow opening to nudge @entity30 toward a compromise			1
while @entity5 leaders remain defiant about their nuclear program , believing that a latent nuclear capacity is essential to the survival of the state , and hoping that the crippling impact of international sanctions would rally support to their cause , they do care about public opinion			0
they will be sensitive to the public 's resentment of sanctions			0
by reiterating @entity74 commitment to non-interference in @entity5 's domestic affairs ( read : no regime change ) and providing political and economic incentives for cooperation , the @entity1 administration could compel @entity30 to retreat from his pursuit of nuclear weapons			1
at the same time , the rise in president @entity1 's electoral prospects in november puts him in a much stronger position vis - a - vis @entity12			1
with the @entity88 candidates in mutually assured destruction mode , and a slowly reviving economy , president @entity1 's re-election chance has surged			1
it was an open secret that @entity12 was strategizing with @entity88 heavyweights for regime change in the @entity74			0
now it is more likely that @entity12 is going to have to live with president @entity1 for another five years			2
while @entity12 has no love for the president , the @entity3 public knows that , in the end , they depend on the goodwill and support of the @entity74			0
as @entity102 reported on march 8 , 58 % of @entity3 oppose a military strike on @entity5 without the support of the @entity74			2
moving forward , the challenge for the @entity1 administration is to manage @entity3 misgivings about the utility of an aggressive diplomatic approach toward @entity5 while simultaneously offering @entity5 a face - saving exit out of its defiant posture			1
much like high - stakes diplomatic crises of previous eras involving nuclear weapons , such as the @entity115 , averting war depends as much on decisions made in @entity55 and @entity117 , as it does on the ingenuity of @entity74 policymakers			0
if president @entity1 plays his hand well , he may be able to succeed at containing @entity3 's military threat and compelling @entity5 to back down on its nuclear program			1
