@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 lost his second @entity5 race in two election cycles on tuesday , as @entity8 sen. @entity7 defeated him to win a second term , according to a @entity1 projection			1
@entity7 said late tuesday night that @entity2 had called her to concede , and praised him for a " vigorous race			2
" the race represented @entity3 ' best chances at picking up a @entity5 seat in the @entity16 -- one that was vital for @entity18 to protect as they faced majority - threatening challenges elsewhere			1
over the summer , @entity2 used a series of crises to nationalize the race -- arguing that president @entity23 and , by extension , @entity18 like @entity7 , are unable to govern effectively			1
he was among the first @entity3 candidates to call for a travel ban from @entity28 - stricken countries in @entity29			2
he ran ads focused on @entity31 and the border security , and focused much of his campaign on hitting @entity18 over illegal immigration			0
@entity7 , meanwhile , turned to core @entity8 economic issues and issues affecting working class voters and women			0
she hit @entity2 over what she argued were impossible - to - peg stances on lifting the minimum wage and mandating equal pay			0
she accused him of supporting @entity3 tax measures that promoted outsourcing while representing @entity45 in the @entity5			1
view the full results and on issues like @entity28 and @entity31 , @entity7 repeatedly decked @entity2 for " fear - mongering " and " grandstanding			1
" perhaps most interesting , though , was that @entity2 was a candidate in @entity50 at all			0
in 2010 he rocketed to national stardom among conservatives when he put thousands of miles on his truck in deep - blue @entity45 , defeated @entity55 and grabbed deceased @entity45 sen. @entity57 's seat in a special election			0
but @entity2 lost that seat two years later , in a campaign against a much tougher @entity8 opponent -- liberal icon @entity61			2
a year later , after a trip to @entity63 and a brief flirtation with the idea of running for president , @entity2 moved to his home state of @entity50 and decided to take on @entity7 -- who @entity3 viewed as vulnerable , but did n't have anyone with the star quality it 'd take to beat her prior to @entity2 's arrival			1
@entity7 cast @entity2 as a political opportunist , while @entity2 emphasized his roots in a state that he left when his parents divorced			0

@entity8 sen. @entity7 won a second term , defeating @entity3 challenger @entity2
@entity2 *previously* represented @entity45 in the @entity5 , but lost *re-election* in 2012
@entity2 had tried to nationalize the race , focusing on @entity23 's handling of @entity28 , @entity31 and immigration
