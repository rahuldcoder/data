-- before she was even born , @entity1 already had her own @entity3 handle			1
now just over 18 months old , she has more than 12,000 online followers			1
some of them are among the biggest names in sport , including @entity8 and @entity9			1
the top - ranked tennis duo have both had star billing on @ micaelabryan -- and @entity9 is quite the regular guest			1
" @entity20 " might have been the early inspiration , but his on - court rival " @entity16 " has made a serious play for her affection			0
" every time @entity9 sees her it 's really funny , he 'll say , ' @entity1 , my little buddy , how are you doing ? ' and he 'll go and give her a hug , " her mom @entity21 told @entity0 's @entity23			1
" and if she does n't give him what he wants , like a good response , he 'll say , ' you 've forgotten about me already			0
' " but @entity1 will never forget @entity9			1
when she grows up she 'll have a permanent record of her encounters with @entity34 's favorite sporting son -- it 's all documented on social media			0
" my wife masterminded it , " says @entity36 , one half of the most successful men 's doubles partnership in tennis history			1
" she got @ micaelabryan before she was born and i did n't even know about it , and then we got this picture with @entity46 in @entity47 when he was just walking through the corridor toward the locker room and he kneeled down and took a picture with her			2
" he says as a joke , ' let 's put it on our @entity3 account , ' and we put it on and woke up the next day , she had something like 750 followers			1
" so it was kind of born right then			2
we were like , ' now she has all these fans we 've got to keep them happy , ' so we just kept getting pics with stars			0
" the biggest " get " so far is undoubtedly @entity62 , the record - setting 17 - time grand slam champion of the men 's game , who was pinned down at the @entity67			2
" he 's one of those guys , sometimes at tournaments you do n't see him he 's so busy , " says @entity36 of the @entity69 superstar , himself a father of two young girls			1
" he does n't stay at the player hotel ... you might catch him in the locker room			0
but we saw him hanging out at the @entity77			0
he was so nice , he 's like , ' take one this way , let 's try this one , ' doing lots of little poses			0
@entity1 loved him and that was a high - five moment for sure			1
" @entity36 and his twin brother @entity85 have had plenty of " high - five moments " on the court in the past year -- or , to be more accurate in their case , " chest - bumping moments			1
" by winning @entity92 in july , they became the first doubles team to hold all four grand slams and the @entity96 title at the same time -- and success in their home @entity98 this weekend would create history as they would own all four majors in a calendar year			2
only one other partnership has achieved it -- @entity106 and @entity107 in 1951 -- but the @entity108 did so before the advent of the professional @entity98 era in 1969			0
on monday the identical twins needed to save two set points in the opening set in a 7 - 6 ( 9 - 7 ) 6 - 4 victory over the @entity116 pairing of @entity117 and @entity118			2
though doubles is considerably lower profile than singles competition , the 35 - year - old brothers have both earned more than $ 10 million in tournament prize money on top of their endorsement deals			1
and both are acutely aware that , to capitalize on their playing success , they need a strong online presence			0
@entity131 ) has almost 110,000 @entity3 followers , @entity130 ) has nearly 75,000 , their @entity134 page has just passed 45,000 likes and they also have an official website			1
" when companies are deciding between two athletes , they 'll pick the one that 's got the most followers or is more active on social media			2
they 're looking at players that give them that extra marketing pop , " explains @entity36			1
" it 's really important for the athletes to stay connected with the fans , they really appreciate it			0
it 's good for promoting yourself and promoting your sport			0
i think companies now really understand and appreciate the value of an athlete who has a big social reach			2
watch : @entity162 trouble for @entity163 " in our contracts now -- clothing , shoes rackets -- it 's all built in , the number of tweets we have to send , the number of times you have to post on @entity134			0
" although he has nowhere near the online following of @entity46 and @entity62 , who both have upward of 10 million followers on @entity134 alone , @entity36 says he was one of the first regular tennis tweeters -- and now many players use it to communicate during the downtime of touring life			1
" i had a birthday ( in april ) and @entity9 wrote me a direct message on @entity3 -- it 's a way we stay connected			1
it 's getting away from email and texts and going towards @entity3 and @entity134			1
" it 's one of the big reasons why i decided to put my daughter on it -- it 's just another way to stay active and be creative with it			1
i do n't like to just post pictures of rackets , so if i meet someone cool , or go to an interesting place ... " @entity1 , too , is getting to see the world			1
and she 's being primed for a life in tennis -- already boasting a racket deal " after a long 16 months of negotiations " according to a post on her @entity3 page in june			1
" i played tennis my whole life so i would love for her to play tennis , because for me it was amazing , " says mom @entity21 , a lawyer who played the sport at college			2
" i developed mentally , i think i benefited from it growing up , all my friends played tennis -- the culture is something i want her to experience as well			2
but ultimately it 's up to her			0
" @entity1 may still be getting to grips with her nascent tennis swing , but she 's already a dab hand with technology -- though more often than not it ends up in her mouth			1
" she 's a genius with the @entity221 , she loves it			0
she 's got the swiping down , " says @entity85 , as he retrieves his mobile from the baby before it receives a terminal dribbling			0
" we love having her on the road			0
that 's the only way @entity36 would do it			1
he wants to see her develop and grow up , and we 've seen her first steps , we see her roll over for the first time			0
and i 'm a good babysitter -- i ask for $ 100 and i 'll do it			0
" life on the tour can be a grind , but having a baby on board can alleviate some of the stress			0
" she does n't care if we win or lose , so it keeps things in perspective , " says @entity36			2
" we lost a tough one in @entity244 and had seven match points			0
we would n't usually talk for a few days , but she comes running at us , gives us a hug and laughing , she does n't care			0
" @entity1 may soon have company on the circuit -- @entity21 is pregnant again			2
and the brothers have no intention of quitting yet			0
" we 're still having fun , we 're eager , we still have some goals left , " says @entity85			0
@entity36 : " we 're perfectionists , i still do n't think we 're playing our best tennis			1
there 's stuff we can improve and you want to get to that level before you shut it down			0
