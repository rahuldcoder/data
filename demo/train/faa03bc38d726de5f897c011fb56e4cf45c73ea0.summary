-- during saturday 's @entity3 , " @entity2 's " @entity1 jokingly scolded members of @entity5 for passing legislation they might never ever read			2
and he did so using a tech metaphor			0
" i think you guys vote on bills in the same way the rest of us agree to updated terms and conditions on @entity16 , " he said			1
if you 've spent any time downloading music , apps or other stuff from @entity16 , you know what @entity1 is talking about : those messages from @entity23 that pop up on your laptop , @entity24 or @entity25 and say , " @entity26 and conditions have changed			1
before you can proceed you must read & accept the new terms and conditions			1
" you tap " ok , " and before you know it , you 're staring at 56 pages of fine print on your screen			0
" i do n't have time to do this , " you think			0
so you tap " agree " without reading a word			2
no big deal , right ? " yeah , just agree , " wrote one user , macbookairman , on a @entity41 forum , echoing the sentiments of many @entity23 users on the site			1
" nothing bad is going to happen			0
but two digital - media attorneys contacted by @entity0 say that customers of @entity16 , @entity23 's online marketplace , should still be aware of what they 're agreeing to -- and what legal rights they may be giving up			1
according to @entity51 technology attorney @entity50 , selecting " agree " serves as an electronic signature , due to a law passed in 2000			1
it has the same validity as typing your name in an e-mail or signing a document using a pen			0
@entity61 , a @entity62 - based entertainment attorney who specializes in digital media , technology and intellectual property , said that because the @entity16 terms are essentially a contract , people should treat them as such and give them more than a cursory glance			1
but both lawyers acknowledged that few people do			0
in fact , @entity50 and @entity61 , both @entity16 users , admitted they do n't always read the terms either			1
to them , it is obvious why people are so nonchalant about the terms			2
" when they change the @entity16 terms , as they do all the time , they give you all 50 pages instead of giving the option of seeing the changes , " @entity50 said			1
" we all know that nobody reads this stuff , but it is a binding contract			0
" both @entity50 and @entity61 are quick to say that this is not just an @entity23 issue			1
other online retailers , such as @entity95 's @entity94 , also impose legal terms on downloads			2
" it 's not that @entity23 is acting badly , " @entity50 said			1
" none of that is true			0
most people really just do n't understand digital rights management			2
" key clauses of the @entity16 terms @entity0 asked @entity61 and @entity50 to go through key parts of the @entity16 terms and explain exactly what are customers getting themselves into			1
overall , the two lawyers said that none of the terms really surprised them , and that customers do not have much to worry about			2
but @entity50 and @entity61 said that there are three clauses that users should be mindful of : 1			0
genius : the terms state , " when you use the genius feature , @entity23 will use this information and the contents of your @entity16 library , as well as other information , to give personalized recommendations to you			1
" as most @entity16 users know , @entity114 not only puts songs of the same genre together but also recommends new songs to download by going through your personal playlists			1
@entity50 said that while this is not something to lose sleep over , people should know where their information is going			0
" some people would say , ' @entity135			0
they can look at my play history , ' " he said			0
" if you care [ about that ] , you should disable it			0
" but @entity50 said that he finds @entity23 's privacy policies scarier , and cited the recent @entity25 geotracking controversy			1
" it 's a long - winded way of saying we can figure out where you are through your ip address , " he said			0
" you should assume that everything you do is tracked or trackable			0
loss of purchases : the terms state , " products may be downloaded only once and can not be replaced if lost for any reason			2
once a product is downloaded , it is your responsibility not to lose , destroy , or damage it , and @entity23 shall not be liable to you if you do so			1
" @entity50 said that there is no leeway on this point , and that anyone who tried to take @entity23 to court over a lost digital file would lose very quickly			1
" the argument is , you could have backed it up , " he said			0
" the contract clearly says ' we are not responsible , ' and it 's firmly established in the law			0
licensing : the terms state , " you agree that the service , including but not limited to @entity175 , graphics , user interface , audio clips , video clips [ and ] editorial content ... contains proprietary information and material that is owned by @entity23 and / or its licensors , and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws , including but not limited to copyright			1
@entity61 explained it this way : when we buy something from @entity16 , we are paying for the license to listen to music or watch a movie on our @entity25 or other @entity23 device			1
but we are not buying the product itself and so we ca n't actually own it , he said			0
" when you buy a book , you own the copy of that book but not the actual material , " @entity61 said " what you are buying here is right to use music on certain devices			0
" so why are the @entity16 terms so long ? the eye - glazing length of the jargon - filled document has frustrated some @entity23 users , who believe it should be shorter			1
" i 've bought cars with less paperwork , " wrote @entity206 from @entity207 in a recent blog post			0
" by contrast , the terms and conditions for @entity95 's @entity94 are about five pages long			1
( @entity94 has some 200,000 apps , compared with more than 350,000 in @entity23 's @entity217			1
) so why does n't @entity23 make its @entity16 terms more digestible by including a summary ? @entity50 said that doing so could potentially expose @entity23 to legal action			1
" whatever is in those 50 pages needed to be said , " he said			0
" could you try [ reducing ] 50 to five and not lose anything ? someone is going to say that it was n't in the summary and therefore does not count			0
" in addition , @entity61 said the lengthy terms are not all @entity23 's doing			1
" when you got a content provider like a major label , they put pressure on @entity23 to keep their content protected , " he said			2
" as a result , you end up with these [ lengthy ] agreements			0
" what consumers should do both lawyers agreed @entity23 should clarify some of the language in the document to make it easier for customers to understand			2
@entity61 believes it would be helpful if the terms would tell consumers exactly what they 're paying for			2
" here 's what you are getting , here 's what you are not getting , " he said			0
" if you do lose something , who you can call ? that 's what needs to be highlighted			2
" an @entity23 spokesman said the company would not comment for this story			2
it 's not clear whether @entity23 will ever incorporate user suggestions and shorten or revise its @entity16 terms			1
but in the meantime , @entity61 said , @entity23 customers should scan those terms and conditions the next time they get that pop - up message			1
" there 's no reason an ordinary user should have to turn to a lawyer , " he said			2
" people should be empowered the way they deal with the world			0
and companies have to deal with that as well because they depend on users ' goodwill			0
it 's a delicate balance			0

what exactly are you agreeing to when you click " agree " on @entity16 ' terms and conditions ?
one attorney says he finds @entity23 's privacy policies scarier than its @entity114 feature
