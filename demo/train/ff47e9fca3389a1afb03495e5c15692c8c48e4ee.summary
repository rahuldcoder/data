the families of passengers aboard @entity2 have been told the plane went down in the southern @entity4			1
some got the shaking news from a phone call , others received a text message from @entity10 telling them to " assume beyond a reasonable doubt " that their relatives did not survive			1
others heard the news in person at hotels in @entity16 and @entity17 , @entity18 , around the time @entity18 prime minister @entity19 made the announcement at a monday press conference			1
" they have told us all lives are lost , " a missing passenger 's relative briefed by the airline in @entity16 said			2
that news gave an official explanation of what happened to the plane , a mystery that captivated global audiences for more than two weeks , but the saga of 370 has produced lingering questions : 1			2
how did experts determine where the plane went ? @entity36 is the @entity37 company that carried out the satellite analysis that determined the plane went into the southern @entity4			1
@entity18 's prime minister said monday the plane was last tracked over the water , west of @entity41 , @entity42			1
there is " no way " the plane went north , said @entity45 , a senior vice president at @entity36			2
the route into the southern @entity4 was the " best fit " with the signals the plane sent to a communications satellite			2
but he cautioned to @entity52 's @entity51 , " nothing is final			2
" " we 're not @entity56 observation satellites , we 're data satellites			2
so it will require a lot of different skills , a lot of different people , not least the naked eye , to finally confirm what happened to 370			2
" @entity45 said the mathematics - based process used by @entity36 and @entity37 's @entity65 was " groundbreaking			2
" the new calculations underwent a peer review process with space agency experts and contributions by @entity71 , he said			1
here are the details of the number crunching used learn more about technology used 2			2
has that explanation garnered criticism ? on tuesday , @entity19 defended the decision to announce the plane was lost over the @entity4 , saying it was based on " the most conclusive information we have			1
" he told @entity81 he did n't want the government to be seen as hiding information on purpose from the families of the missing passengers -- an accusation @entity18 authorities faced earlier in the investigation into the plane 's disappearance			1
more answers will come when the plane 's flight data recorder is found , he said			1
wait , the flight data recorder has not been found ? what about wreckage ? wreckage has not been found			1
there are a multitude of resources being used to find the flight data recorder and anything connected to the plane			2
but on tuesday @entity42 authorities coordinating the search for the plane in a remote area of the @entity4 suspended efforts because of stormy weather			0
the @entity110 's @entity109 has been a major contributor to the search from the beginning			0
it has provided ships , aircraft and significant technical know - how			0
as a precautionary measure in case a debris field is discovered , the fleet is moving a " black box " locator into the region -- which would provide a significant advantage in finding the missing aircraft 's flight data recorder , according to @entity128			0
@entity129 , spokesman for the @entity109			0
what could wreckage reveal ? experts say that scorch marks or soot would indicate there was a fire on board , and how pieces of metal were bent or torn could tell investigators how the plane hit the water or whether it broke up in midair			1
former @entity145 accident investigator @entity144 said the wreckage may show signs of a fire or explosion			1
if recovered , the cockpit could show signs of fire or indicate if the jet 's emergency oxygen system was activated			0
" impact damage , certainly at the visible and especially at the microscopic level , looks a lot different than an explosion , " he said			0
former commercial pilot @entity158 said the wreckage would likely reveal whether the plane plunged nose - first into the ocean , if it gradually descended or it disintegrated in the air			1
" we 're going to be able to tell that by looking at the wreckage and looking at the deformity , now not only ( how ) it 's compressed but how it 's torn , " said @entity158 , who teaches aviation safety at @entity164			1
learn more about what wreckage could show 5			1
what are some relatives demanding ? in a word : proof			1
hundreds of friends and family members of passengers marched tuesday to the @entity178 in @entity16 to express their anger and frustration			1
they said they were n't being told the truth by the @entity18 government			1
" if you find something : ok , we accept , " said one relative of a passenger			0
" but nothing -- just from the data , just from analysis			0
" @entity193 , whose partner of two years , @entity194 , was on the passenger jet , wrote on her @entity197 page tuesday : " there is still no proof that the plane ' crashed ' and all souls were lost			1
there is only improved evidence as to the time , approximate location and approximate line of flight as of the last known ' ping			0
' this is not irrefutable proof			1
dead bodies are irrefutable proof			2
until we have those , we will keep hoping ! ! ! it was both irresponsible and heartless for the @entity18 government to release this information in the way that did it , together with an unproven conclusion			1
" @entity220 , an @entity4 man whose sister @entity221 was on the plane , said , " i suppose i want to see something from the seas			0
i do n't know why i just want to see some debris off the aircraft and the ' black box ' to know what exactly happened because there are too many unanswered questions			0
" @entity220 , who has worked for a long time in the @entity4 merchant navy , told @entity52 's @entity232 that he had " sailed those oceans several times myself			0
besides relatives , have others been critical of process ? @entity237 , an aviation attorney , said he was troubled by the different language used by the satellite company and @entity18 officials			1
" on the one hand , you have the executive from @entity36 saying ' most likely ' and somehow that got booted up to ' beyond reasonable doubt			0
' i do n't agree with that , " @entity237 said			0
" i am not convinced that they are certain where this airplane is , " he said			0
" i think they have fine - tuned it to a general area , but to say beyond a reasonable doubt this plane went down where they are saying is a stretch			0
" aviation experts also expressed dissatisfaction and frustration with the information			1
" we 've been waiting for the shoe to drop for more than two weeks now			0
and what we got was the most tantalizingly unsatisfying thread of a resolution , " @entity263 , a private pilot and aviation writer , told @entity52			2
@entity52 aviation analyst @entity268 said he wanted to see more information about what was behind @entity18 authorities ' announcement			1
" there is a saying in science : @entity277 claims require extraordinary evidence , " he said			0
is the search for @entity2 unusual ? are ocean recoveries complicated ? ultimately , searchers have to go to the bottom of the ocean , starting in a big area and focusing in as evidence is gathered that indicates where the debris might be , said @entity290 , a professor of oceanography at @entity292			1
the search will begin by looking at the surface , using listening devices and then sonar and swath mapping techniques to try to locate " anomalous debris fields , anomalous objects on the bottom and try to zero in based on that , " he said			0
crews could use manned and unmanned vehicles in that next stage of the search			0
one example of a manned craft is the @entity308 -- one of the deepest diving research submersibles in the world			0
the @entity312 took it to a depth of more four miles in 2012 , @entity290 said , indicating that country 's capabilities for deep ocean operations			0
@entity312 citizens made up about two - thirds of the passengers on @entity2			1
" i would not be at all surprised to see the @entity312 take a very active role in trying to locate this aircraft , " @entity290 said			0
speaking of @entity312 , how are officials there reacting ? the @entity312 government is demanding to know more			0
" we called on the @entity18 side to provide further evidence and all the information , " @entity312 foreign ministry spokesman @entity326 said at a news briefing tuesday			1
who was on board the flight ? passengers on flight 370 included engineers , a stunt man , @entity340 pilgrims , vacationers and commuters			2
they came from at least a dozen nations			0
oil painter @entity344 was part of a delegation of some 24 artists who were returning to @entity312 from the " @entity348 : @entity350 and @entity351 " art exhibition in @entity17			0
one of the 35 - year - old 's works , a painting called " outlook , " is part of @entity356 of @entity312 collection .			0

passengers ' relatives clamor for proof , saying findings are not enough
some aviation experts also expression *skepticism* about information from @entity18
wreckage , which has not been found , could reveal important clues about @entity2
