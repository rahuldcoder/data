-- @entity2 's @entity1 went into the second round of the @entity4 facing an early exit after shooting an opening seven - over 77 and finished it by achieving one of golf 's most elusive feats -- a round of 59			1
it catapulted @entity13 up the leaderboard from 138th into the top 20 but astonishingly his score was also matched friday by @entity16 of @entity17			1
@entity16 improved a mere 11 shots on his opening level - par 70 to be one behind leader @entity19 when play was halted			1
@entity21 's @entity19 shot a 62 in his opening round and was through 11 holes of his second at 12 - under			2
the @entity26 event has been reduced to 54 holes after being hit by thunderstorms and heavy rain			1
that also had implications for @entity13 and @entity16 as their scores will not count for the record books because players were allowed to use preferred lies on the rain - sodden fairways at @entity38			1
that ruling means golfers can pick up their ball on the fairway and place it -- but not nearer the hole -- to achieve a playable lie			2
nevertheless , @entity13 and @entity45 played superb golf , with the latter shooting seven birdies and two eagles to contend for overall victory			2
he held the clubhouse lead at 11 - under 129 with @entity53 of @entity21 , who shot a second round 62			2
@entity16 was delighted by his efforts " we play other par @entity57 , but you still have to shoot 59 and i 'm pretty happy with the way i finished			1
" " i was never close to 59 before , but in the @entity61 i was eight - under with three holes to go on a par 70 , " he told the official @entity26 website			1
@entity63 was tied with fellow @entity2 @entity64 on 10 - under 130 -- one shot back			0
the tournament started a day early than scheduled so as to avoid a clash with @entity69 's funeral sunday , but has been hit by lengthy delays on all three days of play			0
" @entity69 is one of the reasons i am here , " @entity72 said			0
" coming here you 're trying to get the win for @entity69 , not that it will make everything better for the country , but hopefully it will put a little smile on some people 's faces			0
" meanwhile , @entity83 teammates @entity82 and @entity84 shared the lead at the halfway stage of the $ 1 million @entity87 at @entity88 in @entity89			0
@entity82 , chasing his first win of 2013 , shot a hole in one during his seven - under 65 for 11 - under 133			0
@entity93 champion @entity92 carded a 68 to leave the pair two clear of overnight leader @entity95 of @entity96 , @entity98 's @entity97 and @entity100 's @entity99			0
@entity102 's @entity101 shot a superb eight - under 64 to be a shot further back while in - form @entity104 moved into contention with a 67 to lie joint seventh .			0
