-- the ruptured @entity4 well , a mile under the @entity5 off the @entity7 coast , has been pronounced dead following the worst oil disaster in @entity10 history , but that does n't mean work associated with the spill is complete , the government 's point man for the disaster response said monday			1
" it 's going to go on as long as it takes to get the marshes and the beaches clean , " retired adm. @entity14 told @entity0 's " @entity15			1
" we have detailed plans that we 've negotiated with the states and the parishes in @entity7 to determine , if you will , how clean is clean			2
" in some areas , such as @entity7 's @entity25 , " we 're going to stay with this for quite a while , " he said			2
at some point , officials may decide they have done all they can , " but for right now , we 're still at it			0
" although authorities say testing does not show high levels of oil remaining in the water , some researchers insist the oil has settled to the sea floor and infiltrated the bottom , where it could affect ecosystems			1
asked about those reports , @entity14 said , " i do n't think we can know too much about the @entity5 and the presence of hydrocarbons in the water column			1
" he said he has been working with @entity46 , administrator of the @entity47 , to develop a long - term subsea oil monitoring program that can be used not only in the response effort , but also as part of long - term restoration			1
" what we really need to do is harness all the resources of the federal government and the state and local institutions , including academia , and build a database that can tell us more about the @entity5 , " he sad			0
" right now the readings we 're taking do n't show large concentrations			0
we 're really talking about microscopic particles of oil			0
we really need to understand better what 's happening on the sea floor			1
" a joint investigative team is still probing the cause of the explosion on the @entity70 rig april 20 , which killed 11 men and triggered the underwater oil gusher			0
crews last week , as part of the kill process , drilled into the annulus , or the outer ring of the well			0
no oil was found there , which could be an important clue in the investigation			0
@entity14 said it will be up to the joint investigative team , which includes the @entity81 and others , to determine what occurred			1
" there are a lot of theories , " he said			0
" ... a lot of people would tell you further down in the well , there was some kind of a crossover between the annulus and the casing pipe where it was cemented			0
i 'm sure we 're not going to know that until the investigative team has finished its work			0
" @entity100 , which owns the well , has left open the possibility of tapping back into the reservoir			1
asked whether they should , @entity14 said that would be a policy decision between @entity100 and the @entity81			1
" frankly , it 's above my pay grade , " he said			2
but he added that any decision would involve " a high level of assurance " by the government			2
asked his personal opinion , @entity14 said , " i think we 've got a lot of problems with energy in this country related to fossil fuels and the need to move to other types of fuels			1
" he called for a " very balanced discussion " taking the risks into account , as well as the need to have an energy policy as the transition is made to more environmentally friendly energy sources .			2

the response will " go on as long as it takes , " @entity14 says
@entity14 says we need to better understand what 's happening on the sea floor
whether @entity100 *re-enters* the reservoir would be a policy decision , he says
