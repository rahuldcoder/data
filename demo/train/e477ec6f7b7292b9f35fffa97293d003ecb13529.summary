-- @entity2 's jewelry comes from the heart			1
and 100 percent of the profits go to a charity of your choice			1
when she was in college , @entity2 set a big goal : to earn enough money by age 50 to allow her to give back to the world			1
in 2003 she met that goal , two years ahead of schedule			0
because @entity2 , 54 , came from a modest background , she learned to design her own jewelry , modeling her pieces after the bold , fanciful antiques she admired in luxury boutiques and museums			1
six years ago , when a friend casually said , " i love your necklace , " @entity2 replied , " thanks , i made it			1
" that prompted the friend to call another friend -- who just happened to be a merchandise manager at @entity28 -- and say : " i 'm looking at something that should be in your store			0
" @entity2 went back to her @entity33 apartment , gathered up all the necklaces , bracelets , and earrings she 'd made ( stored in @entity38 containers in her china cabinet -- " i did n't even know there was such a thing as a jewelry roll " ) , and took them into the @entity44 store			1
" the @entity28 people said , ' we like these things , but are you a business ? ' i said , ' i believe i can be a business			2
' " they offered her a trial run , and her first " collection " sold out in five days			0
the secret to her success ? " i think jewelry should do for women what a beauty parlor does , " @entity2 says			1
" @entity0 : how to get gorgeous this season but @entity2 , who worked in the lucrative field of private equity investing , did n't start designing jewelry to make a profit , so she devised a novel business model : each piece she sells comes with a card explaining that she will give 100 percent of her profits to the charity of the buyer 's choice			1
" to my children , @entity70 was n't an actor -- he was a philanthropist who made salad dressing , " she says			1
" but he chose the charities that would profit from @entity75			2
i wanted to go one step further and let people choose their own cause			0
" through sales of her jewelry , the @entity79 has donated close to $ 750,000 to more than 600 causes , including hospitals , dance companies , schools , and the environment			2
" people ask , ' why would n't you want to keep the money ? ' " she says			0
" they think success is measured by what you put in your pocket			0
i get to create beautiful things that make a difference for people			0
there is n't anyone who 's been made richer by this experience than me			1
" @entity0 : where to shop for a change the silver bullet @entity104 refugee @entity102 transforms used munitions into objects of beauty			1
even as a small child , @entity108 knew she wanted to be a fashion designer			1
but when she told people , they 'd laugh			0
" they said , ' you live in a refugee camp , and you think that 's going to happen ? ' " she says			1
" but i always pictured myself in a higher place , growing up like a beautiful flower out of a mud pit			0
" @entity108 , now 17 , spent a decade in the @entity121 refugee camp in @entity122 , home to 47,000 people , mostly @entity104 fleeing their country 's civil war and its aftermath			1
" i often went hungry , and there was no clean drinking water , " she says			0
" girls were selling themselves to survive , and there was a lot of rape			0
" but three years ago , @entity108 's talents had a chance to bloom : she was granted a @entity136 , under a @entity104 program designed to help gifted young people who have been orphaned or uprooted by war create businesses to benefit their communities			1
today she designs @entity142 ( the name is a combination of aka , for " also known as , " and wel'le , the word for " love " in @entity150 , @entity108 's tribal language ) , a line of delicate jewelry made from the spent bullets of her country 's war			1
half of all profits from the sale of the jewelry goes to the @entity160 , a home in @entity162 , @entity104 , for displaced children and other @entity165 fellows			1
@entity108 herself was displaced when she was only 8 months old : after rebels attacked , she and her father , @entity167 , fled their town in central @entity104 ( her mother was out at the time , and @entity167 assumed she had been killed )			1
" we walked for one week , " he says			0
" we crossed rebel territory , slept in the bush			0
if i saw a breastfeeding mother , i would appeal to her to please give @entity108 milk			1
" after years of moving to escape the fighting , they settled at @entity121			0
@entity108 lived with other families while her father looked for work			2
@entity181 , founder of the @entity136 , met @entity108 when she was just 12 and remembers how self - assured she was , even then			2
when officials said there was no need to build a school for disabled students because there were none in the camp , " @entity108 said , ' no -- my best friend is blind , and they wo n't let him go to school because he ca n't see , ' " @entity182 recalls			1
" the men did not like having a little girl go against what they were saying			0
" @entity182 brought @entity108 to the @entity197 in 2006 to attend school			2
in @entity121 , @entity108 's schooling had been sporadic , and she did not learn to read until 2007 ( despite the late start , she finished the entire " @entity201 " series in six weeks )			1
still , the visit to the @entity197 was bittersweet			0
@entity108 was shocked to see homeless people in a country of such abundance and thought it unfair that some should have so much while others had so little			2
she also could n't understand why @entity197 did not do more to help her country 's refugees : " it made me angry that this whole world was here when i was in my darkest moment , and no one came to help			2
" @entity0 : meet the one - man international aid organization by turning bullets into things of beauty , @entity108 is doing her part to help			2
since 2007 @entity142 has sold more than 400 necklaces and raised almost $ 20,000			0
@entity108 has also spoken at schools across the @entity197 , and her necklaces have attracted fans like @entity224 and @entity225			1
" i wear one , and my kids have her necklaces , too , " says @entity225			0
" it was an opportunity to teach them about remarkable people like @entity108 , and pass on her message of love and tolerance			2
" @entity108 also wants her message to be one of hope : " i believe that whatever you go through , there is always new life , a new beginning			2
so even a bullet that has killed someone can be the same one to help a new generation			0
