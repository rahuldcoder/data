-- often forgotten in our national political discourse are those who need our attention the most : the poor			1
on thursday evening in @entity6 , prominent broadcaster and author @entity5 is setting out to remedy the situation with an important bipartisan discussion of poverty in @entity11 entitled , " @entity12 : a @entity13			2
" the goal of the discussion , for which @entity5 deserves credit , is to bring much - deserved attention and aid to @entity11 's poor			2
systemic poverty maligns every generation of @entity11 , but the 2008 recession and subsequent lackluster recovery have exaggerated the problem to a crisis level			1
@entity5 cites government figures that nearly half of all @entity11 are living in or near poverty			1
in 2011 , the @entity28 found that 49.7 million @entity11 were in actual poverty and the national poverty rate topped 16 %			1
worse , almost 20 % of @entity11 children live in poverty			2
food stamp use hit a record high in june of 2012 with 46.7 million @entity11			0
since october 2008 , food stamp use has jumped more than 50 %			0
an estimated one in four children was on food stamps in 2011			0
for decades , @entity11 has wrestled with poverty but with little success			1
in 1964 , president @entity41 famously declared " war on poverty			2
" a 2012 study by the @entity45 estimates that the @entity11 has spent roughly $ 15 trillion since then , and yet the poverty rate is close to where it was more than 40 years ago			2
@entity49 reports that the @entity11 spends nearly $ 1 trillion a year between federal and state programs to fight poverty			2
that amounts to more than $ 20,000 per poor person and more than $ 60,000 for a family of three			1
and yet , the problem has not improved			2
both liberals and conservatives recognize this reality			0
however , @entity5 and some on the left think the problem is that the government has not gone far enough			1
they call for more government intervention , like living wages and expanded social services			1
granted , the government has a role in aiding the poor , particularly the disabled , handicapped and those who are poor largely at no fault of their own			1
but if history is any indicator , government transactions and services do n't seem to be the key drivers of upward mobility			1
in fact , they can have the opposite effect and insulate lower classes from upward mobility			1
instead , conservatives would argue that education , earned success and the all - important mediating institutions -- families , churches , communities , private and philanthropic enterprises , associations of coaches , teachers , parents , doctors , civil servants and religious and non-religious volunteers , the @entity102 and other worthy mentoring groups , all what @entity83 called the " little platoons " that make up healthy civil society -- are the pillars of upward mobility			1
the evidence seems to support that			0
in a landmark study , the @entity107 found that young adults who finish high school , get a full - time job and wait until age 21 to get married and have children have just a 2 % chance of falling into poverty and a 74 % chance of ending up in the middle class			0
furthermore , young adults who violate all three conditions have a 76 % chance of ending up in poverty and only a 7 % chance of making it to the middle class			0
the threshold for middle - class success -- sound education and moral training -- is not high , but even on these measures our nation is falling short			1
our education system is failing our children			0
in @entity6 , public schools , only 59 % of high school students graduated on time in the 2010 - 2011 school year			0
we 're not talking about academic excellence here , just basic graduation and completion of high school			0
it should come as no surprise then that the poverty rate in @entity6 was 18.7 % in 2011			0
while many high school dropouts join the ranks of low - wage workers or the unemployed , @entity11 employers estimate 3 million skilled jobs are available right now			0
but our students , specifically our poor and underprivileged , lack the skills and education to fill those jobs			1
at the same time , @entity11 's family unit is decaying in record fashion			0
in 1965 @entity154 , then assistant secretary of @entity155 and later a @entity11 senator , authored @entity157 to bring light to the economic and social breakdown of the black family			0
he warned about the catastrophic out - of - wedlock birth rate for blacks , which was at that time less than 25 %			0
today , it is more than 70 % for blacks and more than 40 % for all @entity11			0
with the nucleus of the family in shambles , the fabric of @entity11 society is unraveling one thread at a time			0
conservatives are often criticized for harping on family values , but what many of the critics fail to acknowledge is that strong , healthy families are essential for a strong , healthy economy			1
we know that the poverty rate is higher among single parent households than in families with married couples			1
in fact , the marriage gap accounts for much of the income inequality in the labor force today			0
the first step to alleviating poverty is to promote better schools , families and churches			1
a national conversation about poverty must include these critical institutions			2
while we may disagree on economic solutions , @entity5 acknowledges this much and i 'm encouraged that with voices like his we can start building consensus around issues crucial to the upward mobility of many poor and disadvantaged @entity11			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			2

@entity203 : often forgotten in our national political discourse are the poor
@entity203 : more government intervention may not solve the problem of poverty
he says education , family values , earned success are the pillars of upward mobility
@entity203 : the first step to alleviating poverty is to promote schools , families , churches
