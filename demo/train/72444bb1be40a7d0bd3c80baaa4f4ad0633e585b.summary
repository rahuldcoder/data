@entity0 was difficult to reach -- 6,000 miles away and held captive by the @entity3 militants of @entity4			1
but her family and @entity7 government officials say they went to great lengths to try to rescue the 26 - year - old humanitarian worker , efforts that ultimately failed			1
her parents announced tuesday they 'd received confirmation she had died			2
now they 're working to bring her body back from @entity15			0
@entity7 troops may have come close to rescuing @entity0 in july when they staged a daring raid at an abandoned oil refinery near @entity19 in @entity15 in an attempt to find journalist @entity21 , who was executed by @entity4 in august , and other hostages			1
several dozen elite @entity7 commandos from units such as @entity26 and @entity27 flew in aboard helicopters , a @entity7 official told @entity1 , and engaged in a firefight with militants			2
troops found evidence the hostages had been there recently , including writings on the cell walls and hair believed to be @entity0 's , one @entity7 official said			1
" we devoted enormous resources , always devote enormous resources to freeing captives or hostages anywhere in the world , " president @entity38 said tuesday in an interview with @entity40			2
a spokeswoman for the family said @entity0 's parents often communicated with the @entity49 in trying to free their daughter , who was taken hostage in august 2013			1
last summer , the @entity53 asked the @entity38 administration to consider trading dr. @entity55 , known as " @entity56 , " in exchange for @entity0 , the spokeswoman said			1
the @entity58 first reported on the family 's request to the @entity49			1
@entity4 has repeatedly called for the release of @entity55 , who is serving an 86 - year sentence in @entity63			0
authorities said she shot at two @entity67 special agents , a @entity69 warrant officer , an @entity69 captain and military interpreters while she was being held unsecured at an @entity73 facility on july 18 , 2008			0
the @entity49 did respond to the family , but the family spokeswoman gave no details on what the answer to their request was			2
other rescue efforts included a trip by sen. @entity83 of @entity84 , who went to @entity85 and @entity86 and met with @entity15 rebel leaders to try to secure @entity0 's release			1
rep. @entity89 , @entity84 , said one of his aides went to a refugee camp near @entity93 , @entity15 , to look for her			0
@entity89 said government sources told him a man showed up at a terrorist training camp in @entity15 claiming to be @entity0 's husband			1
he appealed for her release and wanted to talk to her but was turned away			0
the family representative said the man was actually @entity0 's boyfriend , who was kidnapped at the same time as @entity0			1
he 'd been released from captivity and went back to try to get @entity0 released , the spokeswoman says			2
he continues to stay in touch with the family			0
in clearing up another question , the spokeswoman said that contrary to many media reports , the family never turned down a military rescue mission because it was too risky			0
instead , the family had reached out to the @entity49 and asked for notification if there would be another rescue attempt after the failed mission last july			1
@entity0 's family has not spoken out against the @entity7 government 's efforts , but @entity21 's brother has complained the government did n't do enough			1
" i do n't have all the answers , but i do think that a more cooperative approach ( is needed ) , " @entity122 said			0
" and there was n't sharing of information			0
you would n't believe how difficult it was to get information ( on ) released journalists ... from the ways that we have these walls built			0
" on thursday , an official with the @entity136 said a report in @entity58 that alleged the administration failed to act quickly on @entity140 intelligence about the location of the hostages is " clearly false " and " very ill - informed			0
" the official said once plans were developed and @entity146 had confidence in the ability to carry out the mission , officials made their recommendation to the @entity49 and " quickly " received clearance to carry out the operation			2
there was no sitting on intelligence or any delay in acting upon it , the official said			0
@entity158 , @entity159 spokeswoman , said , " @entity7 forces conducted this operation as soon as the president and his national security team were confident the mission could be carried out successfully and consistent with our policies for undertaking such operations			2
" @entity1 's @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0

@entity7 troops made a rescue effort in july but did n't find @entity0 or other hostages
@entity0 's parents asked the @entity49 about *swapping* a prisoner for their daughter
