-- @entity1 , the self - anointed ' special one ' , has been hailed as the man who convinced @entity4 to make the move to the @entity6 and take the reins at @entity8			1
@entity9 manager @entity1 , who enjoyed a hugely successful time with @entity11 , gave @entity4 a few words of wisdom on life in the @entity6			1
the @entity15 , who was appointed friday following the removal of @entity18 , has previously managed @entity19 in @entity20 and will take charge of his first game against @entity23 on monday			1
' i hate my social life , ' says @entity1 " i am very passionate about the @entity6 , " the 40 - year - old told reporters			1
" i have seen many games , the @entity6 is an attractive league and i have spoken to people at length about it , people such as @entity1 , who is a good friend of mine			1
" he told me the best football in the world is being played here			0
how the league is structured there 's a lot of respect towards the other clubs and that has only convinced me to come here , aside from the project that @entity8 have offered me , the chance to work in this league i am very happy about			1
" the move comes as something as a surprise given @entity8 's recent good form , which included a fine comeback to draw 2 - 2 at @entity11 in its last match			1
@entity50 , 47 , arrived at the club when it was second bottom in the third tier before winning successive promotions to reach the @entity6			1
the club is currently 15th with a three - point lead over the teams in the relegation zone			0
flying high : @entity1 mentors @entity61 's ' @entity60 ' executive chairman @entity62 has been criticized by supporters for the ousting of @entity50 with fans taking to @entity66 to register their disgust			1
but journalist @entity68 , who covers the club for the @entity71 newspaper , says @entity62 's decision will ultimately be judged on results			2
" the decision to sack @entity18 has obviously come as a shock to many @entity8 fans , " @entity74 told @entity0			1
" it is not a complete surprise , however			0
it has been rumoured for some time that the chairman , @entity62 , has been considering a change and there has been a sense for a while at @entity87 's that @entity50 has been living on borrowed time			1
" @entity50 is an enormously popular figure with the supporters here , and as you can imagine the news has been largely met with a degree of hostility and sadness			2
" the timing is certainly strange , with the club having enjoyed a fine series of results and performances in recent months -- two defeats in 12 @entity6 games tells its own story			2
" obviously , @entity62 's decision will ultimately be judged on results			0
if the club continues to move forward under new manager @entity4 's guidance then he will feel vindicated and supporters will quickly come to accept the change			1
" but @entity8 ' season is delicately balanced right now , and if results start to regress then the anger and frustration emanating from much of the fan base will only heighten			2
" @entity116 @entity4 , who represented @entity19 and @entity117 as a player , won 20 caps for @entity120 at international level			2
known for his readiness to use young players , he learnt his trade as a 16 - year - old under the watchful eye of current @entity127 coach @entity116 during their time together at @entity128 in his native @entity120			0
while at @entity19 , he took a club struggling at the wrong end of @entity131 before establishing them as a competitive mid-table team by using the products of an impressive youth system			0
@entity8 has a good history of blooding young players with @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 just a few to have progressed through the ranks in recent years			2
youth according to @entity142 , @entity20 football correspondent for @entity143 , @entity4 's work with the youth players at @entity19 produced excellent results			1
" @entity4 's work with the youngsters at @entity19 was perhaps his most accomplished work while in @entity20 , " @entity142 told @entity0			1
" he understood very well the financial rigours placed upon his club , and reacted by developing a close relationship between them and first team			0
" during his four year spell , 23 players were promoted from the youth set - up , the youngest being @entity157 , at just 16 years old			0
" not only did he develop players for @entity19 's own gains on the field , but off it too , as several were sold on for considerable profit			0
" he would spend hours at @entity162 , going through videos and recording warm - ups to get insight on players			0
" but he would also spend time with the young players , working with them just as he did with the first team , making them feel part of things			0
" @entity138 meanwhile , former @entity8 star @entity138 has signed a new long - term deal with @entity172			2
the @entity174 international had been linked with a move away from the club , but has put pen to paper following lengthy negotiations			0
the 23 - year - old told the club 's official website : " i have made it clear from the start that i wanted to stay at @entity172 so i am pleased we have agreed a deal that everyone is happy with			0
what 's important now is for the team to realise its potential and win trophies			0
