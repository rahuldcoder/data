@entity0 , @entity1 -- working as a guidance counselor five years ago in @entity5 , @entity3 noticed that fewer students had access to a computer after school			1
the sluggish economy forced many families to prioritize their money and use it for more pressing needs			2
they needed to pay their mortgage or their rent , " said @entity3 , a former teacher			1
" some of them lost their cars			2
so i knew it was a serious problem			2
" without a computer at home , or reliable transportation to get to a computer , @entity3 feared that many of these students would get left behind			1
so she bought a bus , filled it with computers and brought technology to the kids			0
her mobile computer lab , @entity3 's @entity34 , has provided free , computer - based tutoring for thousands of students since 2011			1
" if people do n't have some knowledge of technology , they 're going to be limited , " said @entity3 , who retired in 2009 and used money from her savings to buy the bus			1
" it 's absolutely essential that they get involved technologically			1
" @entity3 is determined to help poor children get the same educational opportunities as other children			1
according to the @entity52 , students who lack access to a home computer are less likely to graduate high school			1
" the digital divide is absolutely real , " said @entity3 , 76			1
" and it did n't just become a reality			0
it 's been there for years , and it 's getting bigger and more important			1
" @entity3 's custom - designed bus is outfitted with 17 computer stations that are connected to high - speed internet via satellite			1
emblazoned on its side are the words " @entity67 , @entity68 " and " we bring learning to you			0
" the bus travels to schools , shelters and community centers throughout the county			0
" we serve children starting with age 3 all the way through senior citizens , based on what the needs are , " @entity3 said			1
" we are bringing the learning and the technology to the neighborhoods			0
they all can benefit from that			0
" @entity3 and her army of volunteers hold regular classes and tutoring sessions about four days a week			1
they offer lessons in computer and @entity94 basics as well as reading , math or science classes that supplement what children are learning in school			1
sometimes , the bus simply serves as an open computer lab. the rules on the bus are few and simple			2
among them , gum and @entity106 are not allowed			0
@entity3 takes a no - nonsense approach to her mobile classroom			1
" excuses do n't get the job done , " she said			0
" you do whatever it takes to make things happen			0
that 's the only thing that works			2
" the computers are loaded with educational software , providing interactive exercises that reinforce state - mandated curricula			0
children receive their own account login and password , allowing them to continue their work from anywhere they can access the @entity94			2
users can only advance to the next level in a subject once they reach 90 % proficiency in the current one , and the software allows @entity130 to track their progress			0
for older students , the bus brings ged and college preparatory assistance , anti-bullying and peer mediation classes , and student leadership training			1
@entity3 and her team provide about 8,000 hours of instruction to at least 500 children a year			1
she hopes the extra time will help bring students up to their grade level in reading , vocabulary , math , science and life skills			1
@entity149 and @entity150 are two students benefiting from @entity3 's bus			1
adopted from foster care , the siblings struggled with their grades when they entered junior high school			2
" if i did n't have the bus to come to , it 'd be hard to get to a computer , " said @entity150 , 13			2
" my grades have gotten better			2
the one - on - one time , it helped me			0
" in working with the students , @entity3 found that many parents did n't know how to use a computer			1
now her bus helps them , too			2
" they 're learning right along with the kids , " @entity3 said			1
" they do n't feel threatened , because what i say to them is , ' if your 4 - year - old can use a computer and click a mouse , so can you			2
' " on the bus , adults can receive online banking tutorials , resume assistance and help searching for jobs and affordable housing			2
@entity3 's efforts to help low - income families have n't stopped with her bus			1
she also partnered with a community nonprofit to help provide meals to 3,000 residents each month			0
through that work , she 's identified other ways her bus can help struggling neighbors build up technological proficiency necessary in the marketplace			2
" we want to do what we can do in ( each ) neighborhood to make things better for all , " @entity3 said			1
" we run into people who really want to better their lifestyles and are without help			0
we can help them make a big difference in their neighborhoods			0
" to keep up the momentum of her efforts , @entity3 has continued to pour her savings into maintaining and modifying her bus , so far spending about $ 1 million , she says			1
an easy retirement is not something she aspires to			0
" i 'm not tired yet			0
and i do n't think i 'm going to get tired , " she said			0
" i 'm constantly charged up			0
i look at the faces of the children and i get energized			0
" @entity3 is determined to see her services expand throughout the state , even the country			1
she estimates she has enough savings to keep her bus running for another two years , but she hopes to find financial support before she runs out of money			0
" i do n't think about what i 'm not able to do or not going to be able to do , " she said			0
" i plan for the things that i think i 'm going to do , need to do and want to do			0
and i think most of them are going to happen			0
" we 've got to keep rolling			0
we 're going to keep taking the service to the neighborhoods , and we are going to keep making a difference			0
