once was a time when getting money out for the weekend meant going down to the bank branch and joining a long queue			0
since then @entity4 , credit cards and internet banking have taken the place of the payday press at the grille of a bank teller			2
with all the facilities of a bank now fitting into a palm - sized smartphone , the drudgery of waiting to deposit or withdraw funds has been consigned to the waste paper basket of history			0
just a swipe of the finger can now transfer funds between accounts anywhere in the world and even taking a picture can deposit a cheque			0
increasingly high street branches -- many of them still occupying some of the most imposing buildings in town -- are becoming expensive white elephants for many banking corporations			1
one bank , however , is repurposing its more than 300 banks to bring people back to the branch ; making its physical space as enticing as the virtual one			1
" the branch model is outdated and not relevant any longer we 're looking to create a different kind of bank one that offers all the products and services of a large bank but delivers them with real community engagement and the service of a great retailer or hospitality company , " said @entity37 of @entity39 - based @entity38			1
using what it calls the store concept , @entity38 aims to create for banking what @entity53 or @entity54 has done for computing and apparel -- that is set up a space where customers , or just the curious , can browse , rest or come in and do some banking			1
@entity38 's store in @entity63 is the latest manifestation of the project			1
the slick , modern and comfortable space provides information on a touchscreen ( what it calls a @entity69 ) rather than on the traditional brochures			0
customers that want a meeting room can use one of @entity38 's at no cost			2
even if all you want is a cup of coffee and some free @entity81 , then @entity38 's doors are always open			2
ultimately , banking is based on trust and @entity38 has found its local branches a perfect place to build that relationship			1
" there 's no pressure that you 're not a customer with us			0
we welcome everyone regardless of whether they have a relationship with us or not , " said @entity92 , @entity93 associate , at @entity38			0
the model is now being emulated by large banks such as @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , all anxious to rebuild the face - to - face relationships that have been lost in the internet age			1
" how companies come up with a model that captures a truly integrated customer experience , " said @entity37			0
" i think those companies are the organisations that will really win in the future			0
