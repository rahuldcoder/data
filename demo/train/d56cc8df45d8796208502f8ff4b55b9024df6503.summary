@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has spent nearly all of his 22 years living in a small metal shack that has never had electricity or running water			1
he shares a pit latrine with his neighbors			0
he bathes in a bucket with water drawn from the communal tap			0
at night , he reads by an oil lamp			0
conditions like this are typical for the nearly 40,000 people who live in the slums of @entity0 , a district in the largely black township of @entity19 , @entity1			1
generations of families have lived in these ramshackle homes just 15 miles from @entity23 , the economic capital of the country			0
the community has long suffered from high rates of unemployment , crime and school dropouts , and the end of apartheid more than two decades ago did little to change the situation			2
" living in @entity0 ... i would n't wish it on my worst enemy , " @entity3 said			0
" we are simply trying to survive			0
" raised by his aunt , who often struggled to find work , @entity3 found basic necessities like food and clothing difficult to come by			0
but although his circumstances did n't make it easy , he was determined to get an education			2
" i spent a lot of time without a school uniform , " he said , recalling the embarrassment he felt being different from classmates from middle - class neighborhoods			1
" going to school with a hungry stomach ... it was very tough			2
" @entity3 worked hard , however , and in high school , he heard about the @entity55			1
the after - school program , commonly known as @entity55 , provided him with intensive tutoring that helped him pass his senior exams and find funding to attend the @entity60			1
he recently earned a national diploma in banking			0
" this program actually changed my future , " @entity3 said			2
" ( without it ) , right now , i would not be standing here and saying that i went to university			0
" stories like this motivate @entity70 , the director and co-founder of @entity55			1
a lifelong @entity0 resident , he has a goal of helping people like @entity3 change their lives and their community through education			2
right now , @entity70 's group provides academic support , meals and after - school activities to 400 children			1
" there are more than 10,000 children in the community , so working with 400 might seem like nothing , " @entity70 said			1
" but if ( they ) are dedicated ... we can make a difference			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity92 @entity70 , 30 , grew up in a family of nine and faced many of the same struggles @entity3 endured			1
financial pressure forced all of his older siblings to drop out of high school			2
but @entity70 washed cars and worked as a stock boy to earn money to stay in school , and he became the first member of his family to graduate from high school			1
ultimately , he could n't afford to go to college , which was a disappointment			0
... you feel like you have no power over your future , " @entity70 said			1
it 's that mentality that @entity70 and several other young @entity0 natives were looking to change when they founded the program five years ago			1
rather than wait for the government to come to the rescue , they decided to take matters into their own hands			0
" we did n't want to see other young people going through what we 'd gone through : no uniforms ... feeling hungry in class , " @entity70 said			1
" we know the problems of this community , but we also know the solutions			0
" for starters , the program requires a commitment from its members			2
every child must come in with a parent or guardian and sign a contract			0
the deal is simple : students must agree to stay in school and attend mandatory tutoring sessions twice a week ; in exchange , @entity55 agrees to provide uniforms , books and school fees for any student who can not afford them			1
" we 're not just giving handouts , " said @entity70 , whose group is funded by corporations and private donations			1
" we 're making kids earn whatever they get			1
" the organization opens the doors to its headquarters every weekday at 7 a.m. to hand out sandwiches for students to take to school			2
at 2 p.m. , when students flood through the gates after school , everyone gets a hot meal and the chance to have some fun			2
but every monday through thursday at 4 p.m. sharp , students hit the books in the tutoring program			2
primary school students are tutored by the program 's staff twice a week ; on alternate days , professional teachers work with the high school students to prepare them for the matriculation exams required at the end of 12th grade			1
on fridays and saturdays , students play sports or enjoy cultural activities like drumming or dancing			0
books can be borrowed from the program 's library -- the only one in the community -- and there are nearly 300 @entity188 - accessible laptops that were donated through the nonprofit @entity189			1
" not every child will want to be in the books every day , " @entity70 explained			1
" we 've got to come together for fun while we also come together for academics			0
" it 's a formula that 's kept the program 's members out of trouble and , more important , on track in school			1
teachers report that the group 's members have increased confidence , greater participation in class and better grades			0
and over the past four years , nearly every member has passed his or her matriculation exams			0
so far , 21 members , including @entity3 , have gone on to a university			0
while the @entity0 program does n't have the resources to pay for all of its members ' higher education , it does provide some financial assistance and helps members find ways to finance the rest			1
the organization also tries to help the other members find internships or jobs			0
@entity70 can be seen rushing around the program 's complex six days a week			1
although he 's always busy , he 's someone who everyone believes they can count on and look up to			0
" @entity70 , to be honest with you , he 's my role model			1
he 's my friend , " @entity3 said			0
" actually , he 's a hero			2
" the commitment of @entity70 and his staff has inspired many former students to follow in their footsteps , strengthening the organization from within			1
older high school students often help tutor or run activities for the younger children , and several members have come back to work for the organization after completing high school and college			2
" it 's such a great thing to give back , " said @entity3 , who makes time to tutor at least twice a week			0
" we can actually help the new generation to succeed			0
a little can go a long way			0
" that " @entity0 helping @entity0 " philosophy is an important part of what the program is all about			2
@entity70 believes that each student who succeeds is paving the way to lift their family and their community out of poverty			1
when asked about their potential careers , the students ' answers run the gamut : scientist , lawyer , editor , accountant			0
" helping them , i feel excited , " @entity70 said			1
" we want them to realize there 's something they can contribute to this world			0
... we 're trying to give them the sense that everything is possible			0

an after - school program is giving poor @entity1 kids a shot out of poverty
