-- surrounded by expensive pieces of @entity3 art purchased from auction houses in @entity5 and @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity3 's 50 - year old film mogul , appears the very model of a modern @entity3 entrepreneur			1
luxuriating with his wealth , @entity7 explains that all the success , money and pieces of art he has gathered thanks to his film and tv production company , @entity18 , was n't very carefully planned			1
" our [ company ] goals were n't very clear so and we did n't know if it was a good idea or not [ to make films ]			0
maybe we did n't find it difficult because our goals were n't clear , " he told @entity0			0
@entity7 founded @entity18 group with his youngest brother @entity27 in 1994 , originally doing advertising commissions			2

the company also produces numerous tv shows and represents most of @entity3 's top acting talent			1
the opulence and attention @entity7 is now accustomed to -- " people want to know me , hoping to find success and to meet famous people " -- is a long way from when he worked in the @entity47 delivering pizzas			1

" they thought i was joking			0
now everybody knows how fast business is growing in @entity3 , " said @entity7			2
while tiny in comparison to @entity56 , @entity3 's film and cinema industry is enjoying something of a boom and @entity7 is bullish about @entity3 's homegrown market			1

to make sure it does grow and audiences can see their films , @entity18 are planning on building almost 200 cinemas this year in @entity3 ; a country where dvds , mostly pirated copies , are still the main source of film - watching			1
" @entity3 does have a big problem with intellectual property protection , " says @entity7			0
" knowing that intellectual property is not well protected , we need to make sure our main income comes from the box office -- follow up products wo n't generate much income			0
" changing the types of films as well as the film - watching experience is also on @entity7 's agenda			0
after over 50 releases , @entity7 believes his company has gone some way to update the face of @entity3 cinema			2
" everybody followed what was considered to be a successful model like @entity95 films			0
in recent years though , @entity3 films have begun to prosper			0
our company started making films that have n't been made before , like war films , spy films , comedies and disasters , " he said			0
while keeping ticket sales high and collaborating with @entity47 big hitters like @entity107 and @entity108 , @entity7 still has an eye on what 's important , namely making films people want to see			2
