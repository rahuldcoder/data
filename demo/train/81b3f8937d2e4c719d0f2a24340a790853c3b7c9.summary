-- just along the river from @entity3 's economic heart -- the @entity4 -- lies the @entity5 , which over the last week has hosted a tennis tournament which has had record crowds as fans forget about the economic gloom that has gripped both @entity10 and @entity11 over the last few years			1
" when people are not doing very well , they need something to entertain them and this is a great distraction , " said @entity12 , a tennis fan from @entity13 in @entity14 , who attended the @entity17 finals			1
place a five kilometer ring around the now iconic setting , which was specially constructed to herald the arrival of the @entity24 , and within it would fall inner @entity3 boroughs where unemployment is well into double digits , double that for the under 25s , and deprivation is very apparent			1
@entity10 officially crept out of its double dip recession last quarter , but like much of the @entity11 , is gripped by the consequences of sluggish growth and demand			2
dire outlook but within the @entity5 's confines there is no sense of austerity			2
when the @entity40 came to the @entity10 capital for the first time in 2009 , arguably the economic outlook was even more dire , but during its fourth staging this year the tournament celebrated its millionth paying customer and in many ways is a beacon for the heady success currently being enjoyed by tennis despite the global downturn			1
but it 's not just @entity3 , coming off unprecedented attendances at the @entity53 , and with their own " home town " global superstar in the form of @entity57 , where tennis has pulled in the big revenues			1
" the @entity17 and its 62 tournaments are now generating more than half a billion dollars annually , " @entity61 , the tour 's executive chairman and president , told @entity0			1
" we are in our strongest financial position ever and we have the biggest and best group of corporate partners ever involved in the game , " he added			2
increased revenues according to the @entity17 , commercial revenues have increased 165 per cent since 2009 and during finals week , @entity72 extended its support while the big announcement saw title sponsor @entity76 put its name to the tournament through 2015 with @entity3 confirmed as the venue in a two - year extension			1
six - time grand slam champion @entity82 believes that the global appeal of the sport has helped it ride the economic storm			1
" you have great stars in a truly international sport , not based on one continent , and whether you are from @entity93 , @entity94 , the @entity95 or @entity11 , you have your favorites , " said @entity82 , who is working for @entity76 on their @entity88 initiative			1
" @entity97 has a long history , we have survived wars and many different kinds of problems and in difficult times we come through , " @entity82 added			2
attendances on the @entity17 have remained steady at 4.4 million each year since 2009 , excluding the four grand slams and @entity106 matches , and television audiences have increased , with 800 million viewers plus four millions visitors to the official @entity111 website each month			1
@entity112 , tennis correspondent of @entity113 , believes the rivalry at the top of the men 's game , with @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 being joined by @entity57 to form an invincible " @entity121 " , is responsible for the sport 's resilience in the face of difficult times			1
golden opportunity " @entity97 has this golden opportunity with the players you have got at the top of the game			2
we did n't have that five years ago , " the @entity113 journalist told @entity0			0
and it 's not just the men 's game that is on an upward trajectory			0
" i have just come from @entity138 ( venue for the season - ending @entity140 ) where the semifinal and final saw 16 and a half thousand people crammed inside the stadium			1
" " the fact is that women 's tennis has two iconic figures at the top in @entity149 and @entity150 -- it 's a potent combination			1
" the success of the respective men 's and women 's tours is matched and in many ways surpassed by the four grand slams , with ambitious expansion plans in place for @entity159 , home of the @entity159 , and @entity161 , which stages the @entity162			0
prize money increases the @entity164 , first on the calendar in january , recently announced record prize money of $ 30.68 million for 2013 , up by $ 4.13m			1
the eight singles players and top eight doubles pairings in @entity3 will share out $ 5.5 million between them , rising to $ 6.5 million by 2014 , but the likes of @entity119 and @entity118 , who is president of the @entity171 , flexed their industrial muscle this year to demand a more equitable share out of the cash at the slams for lower ranked players			1
there was fleeting talk of a strike ahead of the @entity164 if demands were not met and the issue remains a cloud on the horizon on an otherwise sunny sky			0
" the future is incredibly bright for men 's tennis , " foresees @entity61 , a 54 - year - old @entity185 , who was a former top 40 player himself			2
the @entity40 is the icing on the cake at the end of a long season , with qualification in the singles and doubles the main goal for the game 's elite when they begin their 10 - month season			1
permanent home it 's essentially the fifth grand slam and both @entity82 and @entity112 believe it will benefit from finding a permanent home in @entity3 , extended past 2015			1
" it 's absolutely astonishing what has been achieved , what they have done with the stadium , the players all love it , " said @entity112			0
former grand slam finalist @entity212 , working for @entity10 television at the event , agreed			0
" i made two appearances in this tournament in @entity216 in the 1990s but this has moved on to another level			0
" " they have sought to find a proper home for this event , " said @entity112			0
" and there 's not been a proper home since @entity224 in the 1980s			0
" @entity82 would like to see a permanent move : " @entity97 is a sport which needs consistency and the reason the grand slams are so successful is everyone knows that at a certain time of the year in a certain place the big stars will turn up , " he said			2
@entity212 can also see no reason to move while the @entity235 occupies its present place in the calendar			0
" players will not want to travel to @entity239 , which has been touted as venue , at the end of a long season , " he said			2
special setting it 's a potent mix of setting and razzmatazz which defines the @entity5 experience for the crowd , with players emerging like gladiators to loud music and special effects			0
from @entity252 to @entity120 : @entity97 ' popstar makeover once the action is underway the crowd is kept in darkness , similar to watching a football match under floodlights , but they are kept in touch with match statistics and disputed line call replays on a giant four - sided screen above the court			0
aces , set and match points are signaled by a moving graphic display which circles the entire arena			0
" i have been to the @entity270 events in the @entity271 and grand slams but for setting this beats them all , " said @entity12			0
" it 's a fun arena to play in , " @entity57 told gathered reporters after news of the two - year extension emerged			0
" i think it works very well just now			0
" his rivalry with @entity119 promises to light up arenas around the world over the next few years			0
" @entity119 and @entity57 are two amazingly gifted athletes , and their talent and potential is limitless , " said @entity61			0
" however , the game has never been more competitive and if you can get to the top , staying there is more difficult than ever			0
the chief of the men 's game will be hoping that @entity118 continues his late career heroics , beaten by @entity119 in a classic 2012 final , and that @entity120 recovers from his injury problems for 2013			1
it 's that ever shifting battle for supremacy , echoed in the women 's game , which appears to drive interest and keep tennis immune from the problems which have afflicted other sports in tough times .			2
