@entity0 -- journalists got their first ground - level glance saturday around @entity6 's stricken @entity5 nuclear facility -- eying shells of reactor buildings , tons of contaminated water and workers scurrying still to mitigate damage from a crisis that began eight months ago			1
an epic 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami march 11 wreaked havoc around @entity6 , killing more than 15,000 people			1
while many of those died instantly , the @entity18 nation was on edge for weeks as utility and government employees scrambled to prevent a worsening nuclear catastrophe at the @entity5 plant , located about 150 miles ( 240 kilometers ) north of @entity0			1
@entity6 's @entity25 eventually categorized the accident as a level - 7 event on the international scale for nuclear disasters -- the highest level -- putting it on par with the @entity32			1
it took months , but the @entity34 ( the plant 's operator ) eventually indicated that its workers were gaining control in the crisis			1
throughout the summer and fall , there were no longer reports of explosions , nor stories about new leaks of radioactive material into the ground and sea			0
but the facility still remained off - limits to reporters and , for a 20 - kilometer radius around the plant , to the general public due to the continued high levels of radiation and ongoing efforts to prevent yet more blasts and leaks			2
that temporarily changed saturday , when about three dozen journalists traveled by bus through abandoned towns en route to the nuclear facility			1
they passed , for instance , withered plants at an abandoned nursery , a shattered car dealership and a gas station that had been taken over by crows			0
radiation readings rose steadily as they neared the plant , including 6.7 microsieverts in @entity75			2
there , those on board put on respirator masks , adding to an ensemble of a protective suit , two pairs of gloves , two sets of plastic booties over their shoes and a radiation detector			0
at the plant 's gate , the radiation reading was 20 microsieverts			1
the reading is still well below the threshold to mandate an immediate health risk -- 1,000 microsieverts equals 1 millisievert , and @entity96 - based medical physicist @entity95 previously told @entity1 that radiation workers in the @entity98 typically aim to be exposed to less than 5 millisieverts per year			2
yet it was the cumulative effect that has prompted the continued evacuations of thousands around the @entity5 facility			1
a half - dozen large cranes dominated the skyline inside the gates , while the grounds were pockmarked with vessels containing what the @entity34 has said is 90,000 tons of water laced with radiation			2
they were visible in tanks that filled a field , as well as dozens of large , four - story tall silver tanks filled with tainted seawater			0
@entity98 , @entity116 and @entity6 flags hung near a water decontamination facility , which appeared as a cluster of white tents surrounded by black sand bags			1
the presence of toxins did n't appear to prevent pine trees from standing , and seemingly thriving , all around the facility			2
last spring was marked by regular reports of explosions , leaks and other problems at the plant			2
those accounts , and radiation readings , in june led @entity6 's @entity132 to confirm that three reactors -- @entity134 1 , 2 and 3 -- had experienced full meltdowns			1
a meltdown is a catastrophic failure of the reactor core , with a potential for widespread radiation release			0
the damage became starkly evident the closer one got to the heart of the nuclear facility			2
from afar , a new structure surrounded the no. 1 reactor building , which had lost its roof due to a massive hydrogen explosion related to overheating the day after the quake			2
no. 2 appeared to be intact , painted blue and white , despite a reported hydrogen detonation on march 15			0
the no. 3 building , meanwhile , had been diminished to a skeletal concrete frame and large pile of rubble , which crews were cleaning up with cranes ahead of it being covered by its own structure			0
and the no. 4 building -- whose reactor was inactive at the time of the tsunami -- also had significant damage , with one side entirely blown out , exposing the nuclear spent fuel pool			0
crumpled trucks and cars , twisted metal , a gutted office building and a huge dented storage tank were visible at the base of the reactor buildings , where radiation readings stood at 1,000 microsieverts ( or 1 millisievert ) per hour			0
some of the debris resembled what swept up elsewhere in @entity6 by the tsunami , while others -- like three white cars , with @entity34 markings -- were more distinct to the facility			1
around the plant , crows and dragonflies fluttered in the disarray			0
so , too , did scores of the 3,200 workers that @entity34 says usually work daily at the plant			1
they included workers building water tanks , operating cranes , entering buildings used to store highly radioactive waste , and manning the facility 's tightly contained disaster center			1
the challenges notwithstanding , @entity34 spokesman @entity198 insisted vast progress has been made in recent months			0
he said that temperatures at the three most damaged reactors ( @entity134 1 , 2 and 3 ) were below 100 degrees @entity203 , or the boiling point , a critical measure			0
all elements of the nuclear cooling system were perched on grounds 30 meters above the reactors , well out of the reach of any future tsunami , according to @entity198			0
addressing @entity5 workers , @entity212 -- the @entity6 government 's nuclear crisis manager -- said he feels relieved that the facility is becoming increasingly stable			1
" every time i come back , i feel conditions have improved			1
this is due to your hard work , " @entity212 said			0
the decommissions of @entity5 's first four reactors will likely take more than 30 years to complete , according to a draft report released late last month by @entity6 's @entity225			1
the report indicated that nuclear fuel should begin to be removed by the end of 2021 -- a key , but hardly the last phase in a clean - up effort that is expected to continue for another two decades beyond that			0
@entity233 , the man in charge of the plant , said that all the reactors have stabilized and predicted that @entity34 was on track to have a cold shutdown by year 's end			1
but he conceded that the danger is still far from over -- especially for the thousands still toiling to bring this nuclear nightmare to an end			0
" even saying it 's stabilized does n't mean that it is extremely safe , " said @entity233			2
" when working , the radiation remains high			0
so when it comes to working every day , there is still danger			0

journalists have n't been to the @entity5 plant since the march 11 quake
about 3 dozen traveled there by bus saturday , seeing the damage and *recovery* *firsthand*
a @entity6 official says , " i feel conditions have improved "
the plant 's chief says a cold shutdown is likely , though it 's still dangerous for workers
