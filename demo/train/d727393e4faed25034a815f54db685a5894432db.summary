@entity0 , @entity1 -- politicians and foreign diplomats said they were doggedly working friday to salvage a newly - minted @entity1 government power - sharing deal , a long - awaited agreement that threatened to unravel just hours after it was announced with great fanfare			1
@entity11 , an @entity1 @entity12 lawmaker , told @entity2 mediation efforts by @entity12 officials , @entity9 and the @entity10 began thursday after a dramatic walkout by @entity17 lawmakers and will continue ahead of saturday 's scheduled parliament session			1
saying that the walkout stemmed from political misunderstandings and deep distrust among politicians , @entity11 said he hopes the power - sharing agreement will not fall through , but if the situation is " not amended " and " they do n't come back i am afraid it will			1
" @entity11 believes that saturday 's session will be a key indicator of the deal , hammered out to meet the demands of @entity31 , @entity17 and @entity12			1
the compromise announced thursday was designed to end an eight months ' long stalemate that drew fears of a resurgence in sectarian and insurgent violence in @entity1			1
the @entity17 walkout , staged by lawmakers in the @entity41 bloc , was prompted by what it said was the failure of parliament to actually cast a vote on the power - sharing agreement			1
it threatened to undermine political amity and lead to the formation of a government without adequate @entity17 representation			1
the squabbling , regarded as a political hiccup by some politicians , was considered possible disaster by others			1
president @entity58 and other @entity9 officials praised the power - sharing agreement			1
" there are still challenges to overcome , but all indications are that the government will be representative , inclusive and reflect the will of the @entity1 people who cast their ballots in the last election , " @entity58 said at a friday news conference at the @entity63 summit in @entity64 , @entity65			1
but @entity73 , the former @entity1 prime minister who heads the @entity17 - backed and cross-sectarian @entity41 , told @entity2 that he scorned what he viewed as a political double - cross			2
" this is a new dictatorship that is happening in @entity1 , " said @entity73 , a secular @entity31 who walked out with his @entity17 allies			2
under the proposed deal , the three major governmental positions were to have been filled by three members of the country 's largest ethnic groups -- the @entity31 , the @entity12 and the @entity17			1
politicians forged a compromise that left prime minister @entity87 , a @entity31 , and @entity88 , the @entity12 president , in power for another term			1
the deal created a powerful new office that was expected to be headed by @entity73 , his rival			2
that office would be called the @entity93 and it would be a check on @entity87 's power			2
@entity41 also issued demands , including that legislators pass a law within 30 days forming the national council and form a committee to review the files of people illegally detained , a great concern for @entity17 who have accused @entity1 's @entity31 - dominated government of persecuting them			2
it also called for a final agreement on outstanding legislation and for canceling a ban on several @entity17 @entity110 politicians from running in elections			1
those politicians have been accused of ties to @entity116 's outlawed @entity115 movement			1
after lawmakers elected @entity88 for a second term , the president gave @entity87 30 to 45 days to form a government			2
@entity121 also elected @entity122 , a @entity17 from the @entity41 bloc , to be the parliament speaker			1
but @entity17 walked out when parliament did n't accept its demand for a vote on the actual power - sharing agreement and decided to go ahead and make the key vote for a president			2
@entity31 lawmakers said the vote for power - sharing could n't be taken because it was not on the agenda , but @entity73 disputed this			2
" the proceedings were going in the right way			0
then suddenly they said we are going to elect the president , " @entity73 said			0
" we said , ' wait a minute here we agreed that there are points that we agreed that are going to be announced and voted on			0
' " " i was very surprised , i was extremely surprised			0
this agreement was done after talking to @entity58 , the @entity10			1
" it 's a joke in a way			0
what this reflects really , it reflects the intentions of these guys			0
they do n't have the intention to really work on a power sharing formula			0
" " we do n't want to be puppets for a government that does not respect the will of the people , that does not respect power sharing			0
after all the compromises i am not going to be a puppet running around being a false witness to history			0
" but @entity11 said what happened in parliament thursday was a result of a " misunderstanding " between the country 's leaders			0
he said @entity41 was under the impression that a @entity9 - brokered agreement between @entity87 , the @entity12 region 's president , @entity176 and @entity73 would be formalized in a parliamentary vote , while the other blocs thought it was a political deal that would not go to parliament			1
@entity11 said the scenario on thursday reflected a state of " widespread mistrust " among the political groups and a result of hasty negotiations and a deal that was put together very quickly			0
he said while @entity41 had the right to demand a parliamentary vote , he said their timing was off kilter			0
he said @entity41 got its choice for speaker elected and it should have waited for the @entity88 to be voted on before pushing for their demands			0
@entity73 said on friday he expects the boycott to continue and that he does n't see himself accepting a role in the new government			0
" i personally have made up my mind			0
i will not be a part of this theater , " he said			0
" i am thinking of forming a council for opposition from inside parliament to start building the issues that we think are right for this country and to use all possible peaceful means to achieve the objectives			0
" @entity2 's @entity209 contributed to this report .			0

@entity9 , @entity12 , @entity10 are mediating
politicians say misunderstandings resulted in the walkout
@entity121 will meet again on saturday
