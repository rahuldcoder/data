-- you can find many things in @entity3 , the kitchenware retailer			0
and , oh yeah , an idea for treating gunshot wounds			1
at least , that 's what @entity9 found			0
the @entity12 military had asked the medical technology company to come up with a solution for stopping gunshot and shrapnel wounds from bleeding out			1
the working idea was a medical version of @entity19 , the foam you squirt in punctured tires to plug up a hole			1
( perhaps the military had been browsing at @entity23			1
) instead , it was a sponge that solved the problem , says @entity26 , @entity9 's ceo			0
" one of the co-founders of the company , dr. @entity30 , was shopping at a @entity3 and discovered this kitchen sponge that was dried and compressed			0
you 'd bring it home , splash water under it , and it would pop up into a normal - sized kitchen sponge , " he recalls			0
" that was kind of a lightbulb moment			0
" through a series of iterations , the concept was turned into @entity44 , a dose of tiny sponge - like discs that are injected into an open wound with a syringe			1
the sponges , which have been treated with an anti-hemorrhagic substance , expand to 10 times their size in seconds , both plugging the wound and providing needed compression to stanch the bleeding			1
it could be a revolutionary battlefield tool , says @entity57 , a former @entity58 medic and the company 's director of strategic development			2
in battle , life is measured in blood , and the standard method of plugging wounds -- packing them with gauze or tampons and then applying direct pressure for several minutes -- can take several minutes too long , he says			2
bleeding out is a major cause of fatalities			2
" three to five minutes can mean the difference between life and death , " he says			0
medics were looking for something that " you fire and forget , " he says			0
" you put it in and the bleeding instantly stops			2
" @entity79 received @entity81 approval in april , and @entity9 is now ready to get it into the hands of medics , says @entity26			1
he expects to provide a limited quantity of @entity85 to the @entity12 military in 2014 , with the hopes of expanding the market to other clients -- such as paramedics and law enforcement officers -- in the future			1
@entity57 , who spent 25 years in the military , believes the @entity44 can be , literally , a life saver			1
" every drop of blood on the battlefield is precious , " he says			2
" the faster you can stop the bleeding , the higher the probability you can save a guy 's life			0
" and you thought sponges were just for washing dishes .			0

@entity44 is an *invention* used to plug wounds
syringe filled with tiny sponges fills up wound , applies compression in seconds
on a battlefield , where risk of bleeding out is high , *innovation* is key
@entity79 received @entity81 approval in april and will be *shipped* to @entity12 military
