@entity1 , @entity0 -- for the most part , the audience wo n't see his snarling eyes but the menacing growl from the orchestra confirms they are there			0
@entity10 uses his eyes to convey the feeling of the score while performing with the @entity14			1
@entity15 maestro @entity10 may appear to conduct with his whole body ; from his sweeping arms to his quivering fingers to the way he stands on the tips of his toes and puffs out his cheeks			1
but the true message comes from the look on his face , most of all , through his eyes			0
" you can do the same thing with your right hand , totally the same , but give a different look , the sound will change , " @entity10 tells @entity2			1
@entity10 is considered one of the greatest conductors of his time			1
he 's certainly one of the busiest			2
not only is he the principal conductor and artistic director of @entity15 's famous @entity38 , he 's the general director responsible for the institution 's opera , ballet , orchestra and latterly @entity44			1
he 's also the artistic director of a number of international music festivals : the @entity47 of the @entity48 , the @entity49 and the @entity50			2
last year , he 'd barely unpacked his bags after long tenures as the principal guest conductor of the @entity54 in @entity55 and principal conductor of the @entity57 when he accepted the role as principal conductor for the @entity14 ( @entity14 )			1
they , of course , were thrilled			0
" i often think of the @entity14 as a wonderful fast car and he is able to drive that and he takes them with him in the most extraordinary way , " the @entity14 's managing director @entity62 tells @entity2			1
recently , he 's been taking that car back to the music of his homeland , launching a worldwide tour in august of the complete cycle of symphonies from @entity15 composer @entity73 at the @entity74			1
the performances promise to deliver as many surprises for the musicians as they do for the audience			2
" we do n't really know what he is going to do in the show -- it can vary enormously from the rehearsal , " says @entity79 , principal bassoon with the @entity14			1
" for me , that 's a positive thing -- it 's creative			0
something 's happening and it 's about the emotion and the feeling behind the music and not really the notes , because that 's just a means to end			2
" there 's no doubt the musicians could play each piece note - perfect without a conductor : each performance is the culmination of years of practice , hours of painstaking work to refine their art. but it 's the conductor who provides the artistic cohesion			1
from the podium , @entity10 is pulling , willing , compelling them to follow his lead			2
" when he is conducting , there is this animal instinct which comes out of him and you do n't see it in rehearsal , you see it when he is performing and the look on his face , " says @entity111 who plays the double bass for the @entity14			2
" when he looks at you and really wants you to do what he wants you to do , you have no choice			0
" see more interviews with the @entity14 on @entity10 @entity10 's career started when his mother encouraged him to play piano as a child			1
it was his father 's sudden death when @entity10 was just 14 that drew him closer to music and eventually led to conducting			1
" it was a huge shock			0
my father was totally and completely a healthy man , a young man , he was 49 , " @entity10 tells @entity2			2
" from that moment it was clear inside that i will never stop this			0
i did n't know about conducting , but playing piano and my love for music developed hugely			0
" @entity10 was just 25 when he made his debut with the @entity38 in 1978 , conducting @entity73 's " @entity141			1
" he 's barely stopped since			0
on top of his commitments to the world 's leading orchestras , he stages impromptu concerts to promote peace			1
the most recent was in the central square of the @entity151 capital of @entity152 in august , in front of the bombed - out buildings where its government once met			0
watch video of the concert on october 19 , he 'll join the @entity159 for a rare performance in @entity161 to promote unity in the @entity163			0
read more about the @entity159 his manager @entity164 says @entity10 's energy and motivation may at first have come from an early awareness of his own mortality			1
" i think he probably wondered if he would live longer than his father and i think he probably felt that life was not very secure , that i have to get a lot done in a short period of time , " he tells @entity2			0
@entity175 thinks that later evolved into a personal mission to ensure the spirit of classical music -- and the work of the @entity15 greats -- does not die			2
" he sees the need to continually reach out to people and the vehicle is music , " @entity164 says			0
" he sees that as the way to express the very best and the very deepest of the human condition and the soul			0
" it 's often said that the eyes are the window to the soul			0
perhaps that 's what the musicians are seeing when @entity10 is on the stage			1
" if you do something , if anyone in the orchestra does something that he was n't quite expecting or takes a little turn here or there , then he 'll look up and grin and that 's a good moment , " says @entity79 .			0
