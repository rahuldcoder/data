-- watching the @entity1 stumble around the court this year may make the casual fan wonder who is running this beleaguered organization			1
ah ... er , it 's @entity7			2
after thursday 's 104 - 84 loss to the @entity10 , @entity7 is now the owner of the worst team in @entity13 history			1
it 's a feat that may look strange next to all the trophies @entity7 garnered in his playing career			2
with the loss , the @entity1 end this season with a record of 7 - 59 , finishing with an all - time worst .106 winning percentage			1
they take the infamous title from the 1972 - 73 @entity22 who were 9 - 73 and had a then record - worst .110 winning percentage			1
the dubious distinction has some wondering how the man , widely thought of as the best basketball player of all time , could lead such a lousy team			0
adding to the irony , @entity7 was the leader of a @entity32 team back in the 90s that is the winningest team in @entity13 history , scoring a 72 - 10 record			1
as the @entity1 neared the record this week , @entity7 received a chorus of criticism			1
legendary coach @entity40 , who coached the @entity1 for three seasons under @entity7 , joined the chorus saying @entity7 has surrounded himself with " yes men " who are hesitant to challenge him			1
" he needs more people around him who he has respect for who are not afraid to tell him what 's right			0
that 's the one thing i 'm disappointed in , " @entity40 said on a radio interview on ' the @entity50			0
' @entity7 , who fired @entity40 as the @entity1 coach in 2010 , vehemently disagreed with that criticism in an interview wednesday with the @entity56			1
@entity7 also acknowledged that his six championships and five @entity59 awards , numerous scoring titles and many other accomplishments as a player adds to the scrutiny he gets as an owner			1
" my success will be judged differently ... i 've come to accept i 'll be scrutinized more than any other owner , '' @entity7 said			1
" i know now that i have to have a tough skin about these things			0
'' @entity7 said he had planned to rebuild the team and knew that it could be a tough season			2
but he conceded that he never thought it would be this bad			0
" this year the talent we had did n't respond , but that does n't cause me to turn my back on the plan , " @entity7 told the @entity56			2
there were several issues that plagued the @entity1 this year			2
the team was hammered by injuries including the teams ' best player @entity83 , who missed half of the season			0
also the @entity1 were forced to play rookies @entity87 and @entity89 without much practice time because of the lockout - shortened season			1
@entity93 : former champ @entity87 looks ahead " it is the perfect storm , " said @entity94 , sports director of @entity0 affiliate @entity95			0
" it has been a challenge watching the @entity1 night in and night out			2
there has been very few highs and a lot of lows all season long			0
" but there is an upside to all the losses			0
the record guarantees that the @entity1 will have the greatest chance of getting the first pick in the upcoming @entity13 draft			1
and this year 's draft features big man @entity111 , who is leaving @entity112 and is thought of being able to single - handedly change the fortune of any team that gets him			0
but some fans have run out of patience after watching the @entity1 end the season with a 23 - game losing streak , @entity94 said			1
" they do have a plan , " said @entity94			0
" that is what they said all along			0
but when you have only seven wins nobody wants to hear about the plan			0
they want to know why you are not winning games now			0

the @entity1 ended the season with a 7 - 59 record
that record is the worst in @entity13 history
" i 've come to accept i 'll be scrutinized more than any other owner , " @entity7 tells a *newspaper*
