this could be the last story you read about @entity3 for the next three months if all goes well during her 90 - day stay at the @entity5			1
just days before checking into court - ordered rehab last week , the actress spoke extensively to @entity9 in an article for @entity13 's @entity12 newspaper , which published it in this sunday 's edition			1
@entity3 , who turns 27 in two months , told @entity9 , host of @entity16 's " @entity15 " she 's never been " a huge drinker " and despite rumors , failed drug tests and a drug possession arrest , she 's only used cocaine " maybe four or five times in my life			1
" she 's spent more than 250 days in rehab and another trip " is pointless , " she said in the @entity12 story			1
instead , she should be allowed to " go abroad to different countries and work with children			2
" @entity3 's life off the rails @entity3 's life and career ran off the rails starting in her disastrous year of 2007 when she was twice convicted of drunken driving , once for cocaine use , made three trips to rehab and served an 84 - minute jail stay			1
her arrests were " totally irresponsible -- a stupid mistake , " she said			2
" and from then on , the press were on me all the time , " @entity3 said			1
" it was the first time i 'd taken drugs			2
i was out in a club with people i should n't have been with , and took cocaine , and got in the car			2
" her first rehab visit was not because of drugs or alcohol but to help her deal with the trauma she experienced making a movie , she told @entity9			1
she voluntary checked into the @entity53 in @entity54 while she was shooting " @entity55 " in january 2007			2
@entity3 's legal woes : a timeline " i was having really bad nightmares , and the movie was pretty traumatizing , " @entity3 said			1
" so i stayed in a facility so i could get some sleep and talk about it with someone the next day , because it was overwhelming			2
but i would leave every day and just sleep there at night			2
it was kind of like having my own live - in therapist , because i was having crazy nightmares and i was having aa meetings on set and stuff			0
" @entity3 : the good teenager she had been drinking for less than a year at that point , @entity3 said			1
she stayed away from alcohol after her first hangover experience at 17 , when her mother made her " sleep with vomit still on me so i 'd understand how it felt , " she said			0
" i was too scared ! " she was a good teenager , she said			0
" my friends and i would actually pretend to be drunk , " she said			0
" and it was more fun			0
i never rebelled against my parents -- i worked hard , i was responsible and i did n't go to high - school parties			0
" she does n't consider herself to be an alcoholic -- " i 've never woken up in the morning and had a drink " -- but " when i was younger , i was definitely going out too much and i was drinking too much			1
" @entity3 : a rehab expert @entity3 considers herself an expert on rehab facilities			1
" i 've been court - ordered to do it six times , " she said			1
" i could write the book on rehab			1
constantly sending me to rehab is pointless			1
the first few times i was court - ordered to rehab , it was like a joke , like killing time			1
" @entity9 interviewed her before the confusion erupted over which rehab facility she would enter			1
after arriving at one -- which @entity104 officials said was unlicensed -- she left for the @entity5 , where she spent her last and longest rehab stay			2
" i look at it as a good thing , " she said about this rehab visit			1
" i can come back afterwards and be fully focused on work			0
but i think there are other things i could do instead of going to a rehab center that would benefit me more			2
the best thing they could do for me would be to make me go abroad to different countries and work with children			2
" @entity3 : @entity118 and sober if she is not a drug user -- she tells @entity9 she smoked " some pot " a year ago -- or an alcoholic , then why would she need rehab , @entity9 asked			1
" this is where it gets hard for me to explain , " she said			0
" i do n't think there 's anything wrong with people taking time to just be by themselves			2
i think people want to see me do that			0
they will keep saying the same things about me if i do n't			0
i do n't think it will be a bad thing for me to be away with myself for three months			1
" although now confessing to @entity9 that she used drugs a year ago , she told @entity134 on @entity135 's " today " show a year ago that that she was " clean and sober " then for " a long time			1
" although she was once arrested for cocaine possession and later sent to rehab when she violated probation by testing positive for the drug , @entity3 said she rarely used it since " i do n't like it			1
" cocaine : not her favorite drug " it reminds me of my dad , " she said			0
" i took it four times in a period from about the age of 20 to 23 , and i got caught twice			0
" cocaine made her feel " a little too buzzed -- it made me feel uncomfortable , " she told @entity9			1
she 's not " a junkie , " she said			1
" it 's the truth			2
i 've never taken heroin either , never injected myself with anything , never done @entity154			2
those things all scare me			0
" her drugs of choice are " pot , obviously , and @entity159 , " she said			0
" i liked that ( @entity159 ) better than the others			0
" @entity9 reports @entity3 then giggled			1
@entity3 : not a junkie @entity3 has previously acknowledged having a drug problem , though			1
she posted this @entity164 message in september 2010 just before entering the @entity5 for three months : " substance abuse is a disease , which unfortunately does n't go away over night			2
i am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps			0
" @entity3 claimed to @entity9 that she 's just misunderstood			1
the constant online tabloid reports of late - night partying , which sometimes results in legal issues , do n't show the real person			0
" i 've never been a junkie , and never will be , " she said			1
" i just like going out late to clubs with friends and listening to music			0
it 's not that unusual for girls of 26 ! " @entity179 's advice she slowed down on her drinking on the advice of an actor , @entity3 said			1
" @entity179 told me to give it up for a year because he 'd just done that , and so i did , and it was n't a problem for me , " she said			0
@entity179 was 28 when he died from a prescription drug overdose in january 2008 , a year after @entity3 's first rehab visit			1
@entity3 prefers men @entity3 also talked to @entity9 about her sexuality -- she 's straight despite a past relationship with a woman			1
" i like boys , " she said			0
" i know i 'm straight , " she said			0
" i have made out with girls before , and i had a relationship with a girl			0
but i think i needed to experience that and i think i was looking for something different			0
" she said she was in love with @entity200 during their relationship , and " i still love her as a person			0
" " i like being in a relationship with a guy , " @entity3 said			1
" but there 's something just different about it with a woman			2
when i was with @entity200 , i did n't want to leave , because i did n't want to be alone			0
" @entity210 ' creates chaos ' about her father , @entity213 : " he wo n't change , " she said			0
" i just think there comes a point where you just kind of have to accept what it is			0
" whenever i do try to bring him back into my life , he creates chaos for me and uses it to his advantage			0
he 's been really good and then really crazy my whole life			2
" @entity224 friends while she blames the @entity54 lifestyle for steering her off course , she does point to two @entity224 women who have helped her			0
" @entity227 was nice , " @entity3 said			1
" she just advised me on my acting and what i needed to do differently , and she told me i needed to go back to live with my mum for a while			0
" she could n't move back to @entity233 because at the time , her probation requirements , which including regular drug testing , restricted her to @entity104 -- " the worst possible place i could be , " she said			0
" @entity237 was very kind to me , too , " she said			0
" she also told me to listen to good advice and to get rid of the hangers - on			0
