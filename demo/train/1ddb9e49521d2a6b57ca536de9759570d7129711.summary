@entity0 -- a day after thousands of @entity4 demonstrators demanded an end to rules that make @entity7 exempt from the draft , prime minister @entity2 said sunday that the nation 's approach to military service must change			1
" the existing situation can not continue			1
neither the army , the economy nor society can continue on the current path , " @entity2 said at the start of his weekly @entity15 meeting			1
the prime minister named a new team to draw up a law that would " share the burden " of military service , which is required for most @entity4 when they reach the age of 18			1
the existing law provides an exemption for @entity28 and @entity7 jews			2
the issue has been a controversial political topic for months for @entity2 , but time is running out			1
@entity4 's @entity33 has ruled that the law , which exempts tens of thousands of @entity4 from service , must be replaced by august 1			2
such a move is sorely needed , according to thousands of protesters who marched on the streets of @entity40 saturday night			0
holding banners reading , " service for all " and " we are not suckers , " they demanded a universal military draft			1
more than 20,000 people turned out to protest , @entity4 @entity47 spokesman @entity46 said			0
@entity2 acknowledged the demonstration sunday			2
" i completely understand the demand of those who serve and their families , " he said			0
ultra-orthodox students have been exempt from service through historical political agreements since @entity4 's establishment in 1948			2
community leaders have said @entity7 men should spend their time studying the @entity60 at religious institutes rather than defending their country in uniforms			0
both @entity7 and @entity28 @entity4 citizens are exempt from military service			0
they can choose to volunteer or participate in civil service programs within their communities , but the vast majority of both groups do not participate in those programs			0
the issue is a sensitive one for @entity2 and his @entity73 paty , which has traditionally relied on @entity7 parties as natural coalition partners			1
but his government has showed some signs of shifting toward the center			0
in april , @entity2 beefed up his political dominance when he formed a coalition government with the centrist @entity82 faction , bringing the number of his coalition partners to 92 in the 120 - seat @entity85			1
on sunday , the @entity73 party approved most of the recommendations of a government committee , which had suggested changing the draft law to include @entity7			1
but the party said in a statement that the principle of service for all should apply to @entity4 's @entity28 population as well			0
should the @entity73 go ahead with its reform efforts and force thousands of @entity98 students to join the @entity99 , it could risk losing some of its longstanding partners			0
a lawmaker from one @entity7 party criticized @entity2 sunday for pushing the changes , and warned that the prime minister 's political alliances could be at risk			1
" to my regret , @entity2 does not understand that the demonstrators look to cut off the partnerships between us , " @entity107 of the @entity109 party told @entity4 's army radio			1
" if this will be the case , @entity2 will lose his power			2
" but the prime minister told his cabinet sunday that keeping the current system was not an option			1
the previous government committee created to tackle the thorny issue dissolved due to disagreements within its members			1
a new government team will draft the details of a proposed law that will be more equitable , @entity2 said			1
@entity85 lawmakers will have the final say			0
" we are facing a historic move , a dramatic increase in the participation of the ultra-orthodox and @entity28 publics in bearing the burden " @entity2 said			2
" such an increase has started , it is welcome , it is important -- but it is not enough			0
we want to bring about a dramatic increase in the rate of participation			0
" that means those who do n't comply with the country 's draft law should be punished , @entity144 of the @entity4 @entity145 told @entity1			2
" we demand service for all at the age of 18 and personal sanctions against those who evade duty , " she said			0
" the new draft must comply with these demands			0
" @entity158 truce gets off to a shaky start evacuation of 150 @entity162 settlers begins militant @entity166 group behind @entity4 attack , @entity164 official says			0

" the existing situation can not continue , " prime minister @entity2 says
more than 20,000 demonstrators demand reforms to military draft rules
the controversial topic is a thorny political issue for @entity2 's government
