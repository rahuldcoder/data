-- dear reader : actually , that 's the subject of today 's column			1
because there is a real question that has quietly been building -- perhaps not the most important question in this tense old world of ours , but a question nonetheless : is " @entity12 " an endangered species ? it would appear to be			1
you may have noticed that fewer and fewer people begin their letters and notes with " @entity12			1
" some holdouts -- i 'm among them -- do , but this may be mostly out of lifetime habit			0
even people who grew up using the traditional salutation -- middle - of - the - road , go - by - the - book people -- now regularly begin their notes with " hi			1
" this is mostly a function of the digital - communications age			1
" @entity12 , " which always looked fine atop a business letter , or a handwritten note , is increasingly seen as archaic and old - fashioned on a computer screen or on a smartphone or mobile device			2
the pending disappearance of " @entity12 " is a sea change in the way we write to each other -- yet when you think about it , there are few logical reasons arguing for a longer life for that particular word			0
we 've always used it , just because we 've always used it			0
but step back for a second and think about it -- about addressing business associates , or people you 've never met , as " @entity12			2
" it has worked commendably in letters , but imagine using it with those same people in face - to - face situations			2
picture yourself walking up to someone in an airport or at a business meeting and automatically calling him or her " dear			2
" you might be greeted with a withering glare , if not a punch in the nose			0
and imagine what would happen if you went around your office every day , in person , calling people " dear			1
" you 'd be taking a quick trip to @entity71			0
the reason " @entity12 " may be destined to die is that it faces a dilemma much like an army confronted with a pincers movement in war : on the one flank , written - on - paper , mailed letters -- the kind that have always been started with " @entity12 " -- are rapidly disappearing , as use of the @entity83 mail itself dwindles			0
on the other flank , many people who use e-mail decided a long time ago to go with nothing at all , or with " hi " ( followed by the recipient 's name ) , as a reflection of the new informality and ease of note - writing			1
with text messages , the idea of a salutation does n't even come up			2
( and of course , there is the ever - popular " hey " salutation , used by those who think that " hi " is much too stodgy			2
) not wanting to trust my own judgment on this vital matter , i put together an ad hoc advisory panel of five etiquette teachers and coaches from around the country ( yes , even in our hail - to - sloppiness era , such people exist )			1
they pondered the " @entity12 " question			0
watch : @entity114 etiquette for @entity115 " even with the new normal of being informal , the proper way to start an e-mail is with ' @entity12 , ' " said @entity116 , director of the @entity117 , a protocol training company in @entity119 , @entity120			2
the time to switch to " hey , " she said , is " when we get to the point of dropping by each other 's houses without an invitation and opening the refrigerator to see what is available for a snack			2
" @entity132 , an etiquette coach based in the @entity133 of @entity134 , said , " i really think it is best to open an e-mail with ' dear mr. @entity137 , ' as it 's important to start out with a more respectful and formal salutation			1
mr. @entity137 will respond in a manner that he wishes to set the tone with			0
" @entity142 , an etiquette expert in @entity143 , @entity144 , said , " e-mail does n't technically require a salutation , since it is in memo format			1
and when e-mail first appeared , many people did not use a salutation			1
eventually people started adding a salutation to appear friendlier and help the tone of their writings			1
" @entity155 , who advises on etiquette from her base in @entity158 , @entity134 , said , " in my professional opinion you can never go wrong when you 're too formal , but you can often be dead wrong if you 're too casual			1
" and @entity161 , whose etiquette - and - protocol operation is based in @entity163 , @entity164 , responded to my question about " @entity12 " possibly being anachronistic by saying : " anachronistic ? well , we are certainly becoming a more relaxed society , but there will always be a right way and a wrong way to do things			0
and using appropriate salutations , and closings , in written communications is the right way to do it			0
" most e-mailers and text - messagers do not consult etiquette coaches , though , and with the demise of words - on - paper letters , the future of " @entity12 " appears dire			0
there are , it should be noted , some ethereal and symbolic forces working against " hi " in other parts of society : when @entity190 took over the " @entity191 " in 2006 , she at first began each broadcast with " hi , everyone , " to send a signal of friendliness and non-pontification			0
the " hi " soon enough went away ; evidently the word was too breezy for viewers across the @entity83 who had long watched the evening news on the networks , and were accustomed to " good evening			0
" but an e-mail is not the evening news , and perhaps it is time to begin saying our inevitable fond farewell to " @entity12 , " and to say that farewell before the salutation has already become dearly departed			0
with my most sincere good wishes until we meet anon			0
why should the press be polite to presidents ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			1

@entity217 : does the salutation " dear " have a place in *modern* **correspondence** ?
in digital communication , especially texting , it 's formal , archaic , too intimate , he says
but etiquette experts say it still important to **correspondence** , it 's *impolite* to be too casual
@entity217 : that may be true , but reality is fewer people use it ; it 's likely on its way out
