long before the ink had dried on the @entity3 deal to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling , the writing was already on the wall for the @entity7 : the last three weeks have hurt them			1
they have borne the brunt of the blame for shutting down the government , and polls show that a large majority of @entity15 disapprove of the way the @entity17 has handled the fight over funding the government and raising the debt ceiling			1
shutdown poll : no winners but @entity17 bigger loser than @entity24 polls : time to throw my guy out of @entity28 ? and now , non-partisan political handicappers say the likelihood of @entity24 winning the @entity31 and maintaining control in the @entity3 in 2014 has increased			1
" republicans have ratcheted up their risk , " said @entity33 , editor of the @entity33			0
" there is now a plausible case for the midterms being a plus for the @entity24 , where i would never said that six months ago			2
" @entity33 said the @entity17 is being perceived as " a chaotic , disorganized , confused party " and it is likely that their fundraising numbers will likely begin to slow in the coming months			2
" big dollar donors , who are more pragmatic business types , are now worried about where the party is going , " he said			0
" for @entity24 , this helps them for 2014 in recruitment , in fundraising and in overall morale			2
" conservatives and @entity52 the deal , which the @entity3 and the @entity31 agreed to late on wednesday , raises the debt ceiling until early next year and reopens the government that has been shut since october 1			2
the shutdown began because conservative @entity7 - emboldened by @entity7 sens. @entity57 of @entity58 and @entity59 of @entity60 -- pushed @entity7 leaders to tie funding the government with significant changes to @entity52 and @entity24 refused			1
throughout the 16 - day shutdown , house speaker @entity64 and his leadership colleagues listened to their caucus and demanded that president @entity68 and congressional democrats come to the negotiating table to make concessions on the presidents sweeping healthcare law			0
but when @entity24 did n't budge -- only agreeing in the end to increase fraud protection on the healthcare program -- @entity7 leadership was forced to agree to a scaled back deal			1
in defeat , @entity64 may live to fight another day on top of drawing the ire of a majority of the @entity15 people , the back and forth highlighted a noticeable rift in the @entity7 : between more pragmatic @entity7 and their emboldened @entity87 colleagues			2
poll : @entity87 's favorable numbers take a hit @entity58 newspaper longs for @entity57 's predecessor as news of the deal broke , unhappy tea party groups , who saw the deal as a capitulation by the establishment @entity7 in @entity100 , began to bang their primary challenger drum , promising to run against @entity7 that did n't back tying @entity52 to the shutdown and debt ceiling			1
" @entity28 will feel the repercussions of refusing to negotiate at all and for refusing to live under the same law the forced on the @entity15 people , " @entity105 , national coordinator for @entity106 said , who told @entity108 to expect tea party groups to fervently challenger other @entity7 in 2014			1
" i expect tea party groups will be very active next year , " @entity111 said			1
and @entity111 may be right			0
just a quick look at @entity113 running for reelection in the @entity3 shows tea party groups are already mobilizing to take on other @entity113			1
challenges to incumbents @entity7 sen. @entity117 of @entity118 has been a leading critic of @entity68 's policies on a number of fronts , but in heavily conservative @entity118 , a @entity7 incumbent ca n't take anything for granted			2
@entity117 faces a crowded primary field against state sen. @entity125 , businessman @entity126 , and pr executive and @entity129 graduate @entity128			0
at this early stage of the race , @entity117 has the clear advantage in terms of money and organization			0
but that could change if conservative tea party activists begin to coalesce behind a single " anyone - but - @entity117 " candidate			1
the story is similar for @entity7 sen. @entity141 of @entity142 , who is now seeking his third term in 2014			2
he faces a primary challenge from state rep. @entity145 and 2012 @entity3 candidate @entity146			0
@entity141 is not a favorite among conservative tea party activists			1
in august , a coalition of 20 @entity142 tea party and conservative groups sent the senator an open letter asking him to retire			1
and the highest profile @entity17 senate primary of 2014 pits three - term incumbent @entity155 of @entity156 against @entity157 , the eldest daughter of former vice president and @entity156 favorite son @entity158			0
the national party is backing @entity155 , while @entity158 has the backing of conservative activists			0
many in the tea party see these races -- along with races in the @entity31 -- as an opportunity			1
" the @entity7 have had five years to try and make some progress in remedying the financial ills that plague our nation 's future , and have made little to no progress , " the @entity168 said in a written statement			0
" the silver lining in all this is that the 2014 elections are just around the corner and ' @entity180 ' have our chance to tell our leaders exactly how we feel about the ' compromise ' reached today			0
" as tea party groups threaten @entity7 - on - @entity7 challenges , more moderate @entity7 have publicly said that would be a bad idea			1
" the way to achieve more conservative governance in 2015 is not spending $ $ to defeat @entity113 in 2014 , " @entity188 , the executive director of the @entity189 , a @entity7 research firm , tweeted hours after the @entity3 deal was reached			0
@entity188 told @entity108 he still sees the political map in 2014 as favorable for @entity7 , especially if they focus on beating democrats on @entity52 and the debt			2
" we need to take back the @entity3 and build on our @entity31 majority next november , " @entity188 said			0
" no progress can be made if that objective is n't met			0
" @entity188 continued : " so i believe @entity17 and conservative groups interested in advancing a conservative agenda to focus their energy " on defeating vulnerable @entity24 in traditionally conservative states and districts			1
democrats unified @entity33 said these divisions in the @entity7 -- between those seeking primary challenges and those seeking to target @entity24 -- need to be worked out before the @entity17 can comfortably say they will keep control of the @entity31			1
" at some point , the tea party are going to really want to accomplish stuff , " @entity33 said			1
" and in order to accomplish stuff , they are going to have to change their views about compromise and negotiations			0
if to them , victory is taking over an emasculated , weak , unsuccessful @entity7 , if that is what they think victory is , then maybe they can have victory			0
" all of this news , has been music to many @entity24 ears , many of whom believe the last three weeks -- and the @entity7 fledgling poll numbers around the shutdown -- have made it less likely the those vulnerable @entity24 will lose in 2014			1
before the shutdown , @entity234 , a longtime @entity3 @entity24 aide , said the vulnerability of sens. @entity237 of @entity238 , @entity239 of @entity240 and @entity241 of @entity242 made @entity24 losing control of the @entity3 a possibility			2
now , he is far more bullish on his party 's chances in both the @entity3 and @entity31			0
" i think that for the first time , in light of what has happened , i think for the first time we can honestly take a look at it and question whether it is possible " to keep control of the @entity3 and win the @entity31 , @entity234 said			0
" the @entity7 brand is broken and i am not sure if it can be fixed			0
" the key for @entity24 , @entity234 pointed out , was their unity during the government shutdown			1
minority leader @entity260 repeatedly delivered the majority of her caucus against @entity113 piecemeal plans to fund the government , while senate majority leader @entity265 did the same in the @entity3			0
" that shows me , " @entity234 said , " that we are not scared of the tea party types like @entity24 had been in elections past			1
" opinion : five reasons @entity15 is still in trouble after shutdown opinion : @entity100 ( @entity276 ) got it right @entity278 : @entity87 exit would be @entity17 blessing			2

@entity7 take brunt of blame for government shutdown , debt fight
some handicappers say @entity24 have *improved* their chances in midterms
tea party groups expected to be very active next year
@entity24 showed strong unity during @entity17 standoff
