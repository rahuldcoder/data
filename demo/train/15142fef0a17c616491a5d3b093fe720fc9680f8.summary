-- @entity1 conquered @entity2 at the @entity3 to extend his overall lead with a week remaining in cycling 's most prestigious race			1
in a fascinating battle sunday , @entity7 's @entity1 caught and then passed @entity9 during the steep 13 - mile climb to give him a four - minute cushion over his nearest rivals			1
a spent @entity1 had to be given oxygen when the 15th stage -- the longest of this year 's tour at 150 miles -- ended but he 'll get a chance to recover during monday 's day off			1
on @entity18 @entity17 hopes were dashed , as @entity19 lost his lead to @entity21 's @entity9 before the @entity22 faded and @entity1 charged			1
" i thought he 'd be less strong than he was , " @entity9 told the @entity3 's website			2
@entity1 has now won both stages with summit finishes			2
" i did n't expect to win , " @entity26 's @entity1 said after nearly six hours of racing			2
" i wanted to get more of a buffer on the general classification but i did n't think i could go for the win			0
" @entity9 is a very strong climber and i was n't expecting him to go from as far as he did but hats off to him			0
he did a great ride and he showed how strong he is			0
" despite the gruelling end to the stage , @entity1 and @entity9 -- one to watch for the future -- had time for a quick chat			1
" in the last ( 1.2 miles ) he was fading a little and i still had a little bit left , " said @entity1			0
" i was just trying to say , ' man , come on just a little bit more , we 're almost there			0
' but he was slipping behind			0
" near the end i do n't think that i attacked			0
it was just that he could n't ride on my wheel anymore and a gap opened up			0
" on friday , @entity1 saw his lead cut to under three minutes by @entity49 's @entity48 and @entity51 's @entity50			1
after sunday , though , he leads @entity48 by four minutes , 14 seconds and two - time winner @entity50 by 4:25 .			1
