to hear prosecutors tell it , @entity0 lunged at officers with a " samurai - type sword " before he was killed			1
to hear his family tell it , police shot the 22 - year - old several times while he was running away			1
an independent autopsy proves he was shot from behind , his family 's attorney said			1
and while there 's no consensus about what happened last wednesday morning , the @entity14 case is already drawing comparisons to the police shooting death of @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
@entity0 's mother said she believes race played a role in her son 's death			1
" they killed my son because he 's black , " @entity29 told @entity32 affiliate @entity30			2
" no white boy with a little sword would they shoot while he 's running away			1
" but the @entity38 said there is " currently no indication that race played any role in the confrontation between mr. @entity0 and the police officer			2
" " police officers from the @entity50 responded to a report of a suspicious individual walking around a local business with a ' samurai - type ' sword , " chief deputy @entity45 of the prosecutor 's office said in a statement			1
" when the officers made contact with mr. @entity0 , preliminary evidence suggests that mr. @entity0 brandished the sword and lunged toward the officers with the sword , at which time mr. @entity0 was shot			1
" @entity0 family attorney @entity62 challenged that version of events			1
an independent autopsy shows @entity0 was shot six times from behind , @entity62 told @entity32			1
" we are not going to release the independent autopsy results or the name of who performed it until the @entity72 releases its results , " @entity62 said			2
the claim that @entity0 lunged at officers with the sword " seems to be inaccurate , " @entity62 said , " based on witnesses who saw him running from police officers and our independent autopsy			1
" the county attorney 's office said the case is under investigation			2
two officers have been placed on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated , @entity30 said			2
" rest assured that there is more to this story , " police said in a statement on their @entity92 page			0
" many of the details can not yet be shared due to the ongoing investigation			0
" @entity0 was arrested in january on several charges , including assault , child abuse and intoxication , according to county records			0
@entity62 said that arrest had nothing to do with last week 's shooting , and that @entity0 had no history of interactions with the @entity109			0
the arrest came after a fist fight with one of @entity0 's siblings , @entity62 said , " and since it was his first offense he was able to have it dropped from his record if he pleaded guilty to the charges			0
" " we do n't know exactly what happened , but the fact that a black kid with an @entity121 was shot while walking down the street by two white officers in a city that is 96 % white is concerning , " @entity62 said			2
" there are serious questions as to why officers were questioning him and the use of force in this situation			1
" while some have speculated that race played a role in the shooting deaths of @entity0 and @entity21 , there 's one key difference between the two cases : @entity21 was unarmed when he was shot , and @entity0 was reportedly carrying a 3 - foot sword around a @entity141 restaurant and other businesses			1
" i believe that maybe my son thought , ' maybe i 'll try to get a job at @entity141 , maybe this sword will impress them , ' " @entity29 told @entity30			1
she said that the sword was purchased at a local @entity149 gift shop and that it could not actually cut anything			0
in a statement monday , @entity152 spokesman @entity151 said the @entity50 location was closed at the time of the shooting			0
" we do not have first - hand details of what occurred , " @entity151 said			0
@entity32 legal analyst @entity160 said the case , like the @entity21 shooting , highlights the issue of when police can use deadly force			0
officers are justified in using deadly force , she said , to defend their lives or to stop a fleeing felon whose escape would pose a serious threat to the officer or to the public			0
" so when i see this fact pattern where someone may have been shot in the back , that someone must have been committing a violent crime and pose a threat to society , the public , for that officer to be justified in shooting the person , " @entity160 said			0
" these cases are very case and fact - specific			0
but it does seem to odd to me that , if he was running away with this fake sword , that deadly force would be appropriate			0
" but there are other questions to consider , she said , including whether the sword looked fake			2
" maybe the sword looked to be a real sword , " @entity160 said			0
" and was there a violent crime committed with that sword ? "			0
