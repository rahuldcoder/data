two days after a deadly explosion ripped through the small @entity3 town of @entity4 , sgt. w. @entity0 found himself carefully picking through the debris of damaged homes looking for lost pets			1
@entity0 , a public information officer with the @entity8 , rushed to the town soon after the explosion , helping staff at the command post			2
the april 17 blast at the @entity13 killed 14 people and injured more than 200			1
hundreds were rescued or evacuated throughout the night			1
then last friday , he and a small team of animal control officers were helping rescue animals left behind in the chaos			1
some were found wandering among the crumbled ruins			1
others remained in their pens and cages , hungry and thirsty			2
at one point , @entity0 walked up to the burned - out shell of what had once been a home			2
barely recognizable was the wreckage that had once been a washing machine and dryer			2
as he approached the foundation , he became aware of a white dove settled in the ruins			1
" she let me get within 2 - 3 feet of her , " @entity0 said			2
" it was so peaceful			0
to me it was a symbol of hope			0
" @entity0 snapped several photos of the dove and posted them to the @entity45 page he runs for the @entity8			1
before and after : @entity3 plant explosion " she brought an absolute peace to a place of sheer destruction , " he wrote on the page			0
" the images were shared more than 2,000 times			1
with a population of 2,800 , @entity4 is a small town			0
when people face such destruction , the animal side of the story takes on a whole new meaning , said @entity63 , spokeswoman for the veterinary emergency team at @entity65			1
she and 17 others staffed two mobile veterinary clinics , including a surgical suite and a field services truck to assist in the rescue efforts led by @entity71 and other first - responders			1
they treated animals of all kinds , she said , including a bearded dragon lizard , chickens and pigs			1
some were treated and released to the @entity80 of @entity3			1
three with more serious injuries were sent to area veterinarians			0
she described one situation where an officer on patrol in the blast zone spotted a cat in the attic window of an evacuated home			1
he rescued it and brought it to the clinic at 4 a.m. " it spoke volumes to the commitment of the officers , " @entity63 said			2
one pet owner sought out the rescuers to thank them for their efforts			0
@entity0 said two animal control officers , @entity104 and @entity105 , had sat down at the end of the day , trying to collect their thoughts			0
suddenly a " mountain of a man " appeared and demanded to know which one of them was @entity110 , @entity0 said			0
@entity105 tentatively looked up and identified himself			0
" i just want you to know you found my boxer , " the man bellowed , describing how he 'd believed there was little hope of the dog 's rescue because of its aggressive nature			0
@entity110 then described how he had gently spoken to the boxer and easily gotten a leash on the dog			0
the man grabbed the officer in a big hug , while his wife tearfully thanked the group , @entity0 said			0
some of the 75 animals sent to the @entity80 have been reunited with their owners , but @entity0 noted : " it 's a long road to hope			2
it 's a long road to recovery			0
but this town is going to come back stronger and better			0

animals rescued in the days following the blast included pigs , chickens
pets were treated at mobile clinics from @entity65
