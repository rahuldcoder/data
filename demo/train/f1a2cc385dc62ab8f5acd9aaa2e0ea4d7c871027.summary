-- i remember the day i rang the bell			2
when you finish radiation treatment at @entity6 in @entity7 , there 's a bell in the waiting room that you ring three times , and when you do , the entire room erupts with applause			2
i remember the immediate rush when it was my turn			2
i felt the euphoric joy of having survived			2
it 's an elation that comes along with being alive and knowing that you 've made it past chemotherapy , radiation and surgery , with clean margins			2
i felt deep gratitude for my medical caregivers , my generous friends and my family , especially my family			0
that was nine years ago			0
but still , even now , i have unanswered questions about the disease that almost cut my life short			1
at age 38 , i was given six months to live			1
i had sarcoma , a rare cancer that can occur in bone or soft tissue , with no known cause and no cure			1
my lingering questions about sarcoma fuels my motivation to produce " until 20 , " a documentary that follows @entity44 's quest to live his few remaining days of life fully			1
when i met @entity44 he was about to turn 20			1
we had both won the sarcoma cancer lottery			1
my 4 - inch tumor was found growing along the radial nerve in my right arm			0
@entity44 's tumor resulted in the removal of about 40 % of his left femur and 20 % of his tibia			1
the five - year survival rate for this disease is frighteningly low			2
according to the @entity59 , the five - year survival rate is about 66 %			0
for me , after getting to know @entity44 the mystery of why i survived and many people do not triggered " survivor 's guilt			1
" this is the guilt that can occur when someone survives a traumatic event that others do not , such as accidents , war , natural disasters and even illnesses like cancer			2
guilt is a complicated emotion			0
my cancer fight lasted a year and a half , and now , as far as my doctors know , there no active tumor cells in my body			2
after repeated recurrences and seven major surgeries since his diagnosis at age 13 , he died in february			1
we were fortunate enough that @entity44 chose to share the final year of his life with us			1
@entity44 said , " it 's all about perspective			1
i 'm constantly told that 's what i provide people when they hear my story			2
i 'm told that i give them new perspective on their life			2
" like @entity44 , i prefer to ask " now that i been marked by this disease , what can i do to make a difference ? " i had cancer			1
" until 20 " is @entity44 ' story			1
he should be an inspiration , not just for patients facing incurable diseases , and be seen as someone who encouraged adults and young people to make meaningful , values - based choices with their time and their lives			0
this documentary chronicles @entity44 ' life after diagnosis , as he grows from a young athlete blindsided by disease into a passionate and caring young man			1
@entity44 shows us that you do n't have to live a long life to make a difference			1
sarcoma tumors develop in healthy people with no apparent risk factors			0
there 's little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to find a cure for sarcoma			0
one percent of all adult cancers in @entity131 are sarcoma , and 15 % of all childhood cancers are sarcoma			0
with so few cases , there 's little money to be made from research			0
i have no patience with " my cancer is worse than your cancer " conversations			2
@entity142 is not a competition			0
@entity142 causes us all pain , and having a rare cancer is exponentially devastating , because there is so little research being done			1
the only remedy is banding together to create awareness and pushing for research funding			0
according to dr. @entity158 at @entity6 , " one option would be to put in place some rules or some laws that protect drug companies to allow them to invest research dollars			0
and in some sort of tax reform or some way to encourage them to invest here , to make it worth their while to invest here			0
" why do we wait for a disease to teach us about living well and having compassion for others ? @entity44 changed my life			1
in his deliberate quest to live a life worth living , he reminded me to live as though my days are numbered and to make every day count			1
you just need grit , passion and focused purpose			0
i have to believe that one of the most effective ways to move beyond survivor 's guilt is to find purpose in my experience			0
i 've learned lessons i could n't have learned any other way			0
what seemed to be my premature death sentence has also become my good fortune			0
@entity44 gave me renewed perspective			1
" am i sad about everything i am going to miss out on in life ? absolutely , " said @entity44			1
" but i am at peace			0
i 've lived a pretty incredible 20 years			0
" join us on @entity195 / @entity194 .			0

@entity197 was diagnosed with a rare cancer at age of 38
her film will tell the story of @entity44 , a patient who also had the disease
@entity44 was able to appreciate his short life while enduring seven major surgeries
@entity197 : why do we wait for a disease to teach us about living well and having compassion ?
