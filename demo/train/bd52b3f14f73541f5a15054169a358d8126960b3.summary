removed the message in disgust ? @entity8 is aware of the problem			0
while some users -- 200 million of them , revealed @entity8 ceo @entity16 at a @entity17 in @entity18 -- enjoy playing games on the service , others are n't interested			2
according to @entity8 , users either " love playing games or hate them , " and the company so far did n't have " the right tools to enable developers to grow their games while at the same time providing a great user experience for non-gamers			1
" thus , @entity8 has devised a plan to make games less annoying to non-users , and more engaging to gamers at the same time			0
the first part is relatively easy : @entity8 will simply be showing application stories only to users who are already engaging with the application , meaning that people who do n't play @entity4 wo n't have to endure @entity4 - related posts in their feeds			1
if @entity8 decides you are interested in games , it will be displaying full game stories ( instead of collapsed ones ) in the @entity44 , as well as adding prominent counts to those stories to highlight tasks that need to be completed within a game			0
bookmarks will get smarter -- apps will be automatically bookmarked and reordered based on actual usage			1
finally , @entity8 will start notifying users when their friends start playing a game ( in addition to highlighting their activity within the game )			0
from the users ' perspective , these are welcome changes , especially for non-gamers who wo n't be pestered by constant game - related notifications			2
from the game developers ' end , it remains to be seen whether these improvements will alleviate the fact that gaming - related notifications will now be less aggressive than before			1

@entity8 is trying to limit *updates* about games , such as @entity4 , that some users find annoying
according to @entity8 , users either " love playing games or hate them "
apps will be automatically bookmarked and reordered based on actual usage
gaming - related notifications will now be less aggressive than before
