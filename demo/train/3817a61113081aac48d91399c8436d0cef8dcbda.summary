-- net neutrality supporters say they 're unhappy that the @entity3 and @entity4 proposal for new net neutrality rules does not go far enough			1
on monday the companies announced a joint proposal that outlines a legislative framework for consideration by lawmakers			0
the companies have been working together on the net neutrality issue for almost a year			1
in october , they issued a shared statement of principles on net neutrality			2
and then , a few months later , they submitted a joint filing to the @entity18			0
in late march , the @entity19 discussed their interest in an open internet through an op - ed in @entity23			0
there was almost no positive response from net neutrality supporters on the proposal			1
but the biggest disappointment for net neutrality supporters appears to be the fact that @entity4 and @entity3 agreed that new regulation or net neutrality laws should not apply equally to wireless networks			1
" they are promising @entity43 only for a certain part of the @entity21 , one that they 'll likely stop investing in , " the @entity34 , a group that consists of several advocacy groups including @entity36 , @entity37 , the @entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40 said in its statement			0
@entity47 , a political adviser for @entity40 , said the proposal would lead to " outright blocking of applications and content on increasingly popular wireless platforms			0
" net neutrality supporters in @entity54 are also concerned about wireless being left out of the proposal			1
" today 's proposal leaves out essential elements that should be a part of @entity18 action to ensure a free and open @entity21 , " rep. @entity57 ( @entity58 ) said in a statement			0
" the proposal does not apply its prohibition against blocking or slowing internet traffic to wireless broadband services , for example , and it does n't mention the need to ensure consumers ' privacy online , a glaring omission as examples abound of companies tracking and targeting users ' every click			2
" while broadband providers such as @entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity3 have always opposed regulation or new laws that would dictate how they could run their networks , they have softened their stance over the past several months , and now they accept they will have to live with some rules			2
that said , the nation 's two biggest wireless phone companies , @entity79 and @entity3 , say applying the same net neutrality rules designed for wireline networks to wireless networks is not a good idea			1
these companies say that wireless networks differ from wireline broadband networks because bandwidth is more limited on a wireless network			1
imposing new rules on how carriers operate their wireless networks would stifle investment , they argue			1
indeed , wireless networks do have capacity constraints			2
but consumer advocates ' skepticism about the intentions of @entity4 and @entity3 may be well - founded			1
@entity4 's and @entity3 's interests are much more closely aligned in wireless than they are in the traditional broadband market			1
@entity4 's @entity114 operating system is on dozens of smartphones filled with specialized @entity4 apps that are sold by wireless operators , such as @entity118			0
in fact , @entity4 and @entity118 , which is majority - owned by @entity3 , have worked closely together to bring new phones , such as the @entity121 and @entity122 , to market using the @entity114 platform			1
@entity3 has been banking on the @entity4 devices to lead its smartphone assault on @entity79 and @entity127 's @entity126			2
but before anyone gets too worked up about this proposal , supporters and detractors need to remember this is simply a proposal			0
@entity4 and @entity3 do not write law nor do they impose regulations			2
and the @entity18 writes regulations			0
@entity4 and @entity3 say they are merely making sure they are being heard in the debate			0
at the end of the day , policy makers will be hearing from all sides , as they have for more than three years			0
so far the @entity18 , which has been drafting new net neutrality regulation , has kept mum on the proposal @entity4 and @entity3			1
the agency declined to comment on monday			0
but @entity18 chairman @entity146 has said previously he believes that net neutrality principles should apply to wireless networks as well as traditional wired broadband networks			1
meanwhile , @entity79 , which says it was not a party to the drafting of this proposal , said it will examine the document closely			0
" we remain committed to achieving a consensus solution to the net neutrality issue , either with the @entity18 or with the @entity54 , " @entity154 , @entity79 vice president of public affairs and media relations , said in a statement			2
" in that sense , the @entity3 - @entity4 agreement demonstrates that it is possible to bridge differences on this issue			1
