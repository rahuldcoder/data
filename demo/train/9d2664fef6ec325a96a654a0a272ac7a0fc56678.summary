-- when @entity3 snipers rescued an @entity5 cargo - ship captain last month from @entity7 pirates , it sounded like something from a movie			2
this shooting game by @entity11 lets players try to rescue a ship captain from @entity7 pirates			2
but in today 's instant - gratification culture , there 's no need to wait for @entity17 to re-enact that dramatic high - seas story			2
video game developers are already on the case			1
online gaming site @entity21 launched " saving captain @entity25 , " a simple , two - dimensional shooting game , within nine days of the actual rescue			1
not to be outdone , @entity26 followed soon afterwards with " @entity27 : pirates on the @entity36 , " a pc multiplayer action game that puts players in the middle of a pirate attack on a cargo ship -- and even lets them become one of the pirates			2
these are just several of many online and cell - phone games based on recent news events			1
" hero on the @entity45 , " a primitive @entity47 game , lets people pretend they 're pilot @entity41 and navigate a plummeting airliner to a safe water landing			1
a successful attempt brings applause , while a botched landing results in a sinking plane , accompanied by ominous gurgling sounds			2
" @entity54 , " launched last month with a social message and already played 1.4 million times online , forces batters to pick between using steroids or working out in a gym			2
in " @entity60 , " gamers seek to save the world from the spread of swine flu			0
and " @entity69 " lets players try to boost the economy by awarding government cash to shady corporate fat - cats or struggling homeowners ( well , duh )			0
such topical , and satirical , games speak to our need for a light - hearted break from serious news , said @entity76 publisher @entity75			1
" so many events in the news are devastating , " he said			1
" these games are a fun escape			0
they 're good for a laugh , and nobody gets hurt -- unlike in the real world			0
" the idea to publish games based on news events was inspired in part by the success of viral videos such as @entity91 's " this land , " an animated online parody that became an instant sensation during the 2004 presidential election season , said @entity95 , who heads up the @entity96			1
" it went around the world like wildfire , " said @entity95 , whose group runs @entity98 , a teen gaming site that he said had 11.7 million unique users last month			0
the success of " @entity90 " signaled that people who got a kick from watching a topical video spoof online might just as easily spend a few minutes playing a similar game			1
some early examples included " @entity109 , " inspired by the former @entity5 vice president 's 2006 hunting mishap , and the " @entity112 , " which invited players to relive the startling 2006 @entity115 moment in which @entity117 soccer player @entity116 went after an @entity119 player head first			0
as several global leaders have discovered , almost any embarrassing episode can be turned into a video game			0
last december 's incident at a @entity125 news conference , at which an @entity127 journalist hurled his shoes at then - @entity5 president @entity129 , inspired several games			1
out of the @entity131 came one hastily - published version , " sock and @entity134 , " which encouraged players to throw shoes at @entity129			0
as of this week , sockandawe.com reports that more than 94 million virtual size - 10 shoes have walloped the former leader of the free world			0
and as if viral videos of his dozing off at a @entity146 news conference in february were n't embarrassing enough , former @entity143 finance minister @entity142 soon had a game to remind him of his slumber blunder			1
translated by a spokesman for the @entity143 developer @entity150 as " doze off while answering question ! , " the @entity47 game for mobile phones challenges players to keep the minister awake long enough to answer reporters			1
gamers win points by having @entity142 answer journalists ' questions on time , but the game ends if the minister falls asleep while being asked a question			1
more recently , @entity166 , a @entity167 - based company that fosters mobile communities , launched " made off , " a game that invites online players to outscam businessman @entity171 , who pleaded guilty to defrauding thousands of investors			1
" think you 've got what it takes to build a better ponzi scheme than @entity178 ? " the site asks			2
" @entity179 wanted to rob , cheat and steal from innocent investors ? well now 's your chance ! ... play as a slimy fund manager , a savvy investor , or both			0
" some reality - based games hit too close to home , however			2
late last month , publisher @entity187 killed one controversial game before it was even released			1
" @entity197 " was billed as a documentary - like experience in which players could feel like they were part of the 2004 @entity5 campaign against insurgents in the @entity127 city			1
although @entity200 veterans were enlisted as consultants in the game 's development , critics accused the publisher of trivializing one of the bloodiest battles of an ongoing war			2
a @entity187 spokesperson told @entity0 he could n't comment on the matter			0
a few ambitious game developers such as @entity211 publish challenging , event - inspired online simulations			1
" september 12 " lets players explore the @entity5 response to the sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , while " @entity219 " takes a similar approach to the march 11 , 2004 , attacks in @entity218			0
" traditionally , videogames have focused on fantasy rather than reality , but we believe that they can be a great tool for better understanding our world , " explains the site			0
" we prefer games that encourage critical thinking , even if the player disagrees with our games ' ideas			0
" but most news - related games are simple flash games that are churned out quickly to capitalize on current events			1
while amusing at first , they lack the complexity to hold gamers ' attention for long , experts say			1
" they 're not very sophisticated			0
they 're pretty much like home brew ... made by two or three people in their basement for a laugh , " said @entity240			0
" they 're flashes in the pan			0
they can rack up millions of plays , but three years from now , will anybody still be trying to get the high score on ' @entity60 ? ' "			0

developers are *creating* online and cell phone games inspired by real news events
gamers can land a plane on the @entity45 or build a @entity171 - like investment scheme
many are primitive , two - dimensional flash games that do n't hold long - term *interest*
one controversial game , " @entity197 , " was *yanked* by its publisher
