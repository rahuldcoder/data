-- earlier this summer , @entity2 's @entity1 announced that it would be rearranging some of its subway signs because they resembled a slightly naughty bit of internet slang			1
the signage for the @entity8 , @entity9 , and l lines read " @entity15 , " which savvy web users know as self - deprecating shorthand for " @entity14 -- my life			1
" the double meaning of its signs caught the transit authority off guard , but they 've worked quickly to switch around the letters			2
@entity2 's subways are hardly the first victims of acronym problems , though			1
let 's take a look at ten other organizations , places , and businesses that have realized a bit too late that their initials meant a little more than they had intended			1
@entity0 : 11 regional soft drinks 1			2
@entity37 in 2009 , the @entity39 's biggest problem was n't finding a way to attract more people to the metropolitan @entity43 area ; it was the realization that its initials mirrored the slang abbreviation for " what the @entity8 -- ? " the wtf from @entity48 's @entity47 has been around since 1979 , so it likely predates the vulgar @entity37			1
in the end , though , you ca n't fight an internet meme			1
the organization changed its name to the @entity39 of @entity54			0
the @entity37 's only consolation must be that it 's not alone			1
in 2008 , the @entity58 @entity57 allowed drivers whose license plates contained " wtf " to swap out their tags free of charge			0
the @entity57 also had to change its website ; the sample plate pictured on the site was " @entity66			0
" @entity0 : why soap operas look so different ? 2			0
doa in a move that must have been unsettling for thousands of @entity71 's seniors , the state changed the name of its @entity73 to the @entity73 on aging , or @entity74 , in 2009			1
something 's telling us that the change has n't helped @entity71 's elderly sleep any easier			1
the organization now goes by @entity80 , for @entity81 on aging			1
@entity0 : people who switched careers after 50 3			0
@entity84 when @entity86 started her ambulance company in @entity88 , @entity89 , in 1955 , she hit on a pretty brilliant acronym : @entity84			1
the letters stood for " attitude , integrity , dependability , and service , " which are all great qualities for an ambulance line			0
the name was also easy to remember in times of crisis			0
she did n't foresee the name eventually signifying one of the greatest medical catastrophes of the century , though			0
by 1985 , the @entity104 reported that @entity106 's drivers were being taunted and that the public mistakenly started to think that the line only transported @entity84 patients			1
finally , she had enough and changed the line 's name to " ame , " even giving up the ambulances ' customized line of " @entity84 " and " @entity115 " license plates			1
@entity117 while @entity120 identifiers for airports are n't technically acronyms , the three - letter codes can give rise to their own headaches			1
just ask the @entity125 , which the @entity120 saddled with the unfortunate designator " @entity117			1
" airport authorities petitioned for a new code , and the @entity120 -- and this is not a joke -- offered them " gay " as a nod to the " @entity134 " part of the airport 's name			1
@entity125 decided that switching to gay probably would n't save them much sophomoric taunting , so officials decided to make the best of the @entity117 situation			1
now the airport markets playful t - shirts emblazoned with slogans like " @entity117			1
" @entity117 might not even be the worst airport code			1
according to a 2008 @entity104 story , @entity145 's is fat , and @entity149 , @entity148 's is @entity150			2
the big winner has to be @entity152 , @entity153 , though			0
we 'll let you guess how that one gets abbreviated			0
@entity157 in 2007 , @entity158 opened a new streetcar line connecting the @entity161 neighborhood to the city 's downtown			2
while the project was officially called the @entity157 , local residents began ribbing it as the @entity157 , or @entity157			0
although the city and the line 's developers did what they could to dispel the notion that the line had a bawdy name , residents still refer to it as the @entity157 ; in 2007 the @entity175 even reported that a coffeehouse was selling t - shirts that read , " ride the @entity157			1
@entity178 in 2000 , delegates of @entity182 's @entity181 convention needed a name for their newly formed political party			2
they came up with @entity185 , which in addition to taking roughly six minutes to pronounce was abbreviated @entity178			0
organizers quickly realized the blunder and changed the party 's name to the @entity191			2
@entity0 : 50 amazing facts for our 50th issue 7			0
@entity195 in 1998 , the @entity195 chose to change its name to @entity195 to discourage people from pronouncing its unfortunate acronym as " whoops ! " the old name left the utility open to quite a bit of taunting in 1983 , when the @entity195 defaulted on $ 2.25 billion worth of bonds			2
@entity205 in 1990 , the @entity206 of @entity207 decided it had heard just about enough kidding about its acronym , @entity205 , which resembled an old offensive term for a homosexual man			2
the musicians changed their name to the @entity213			0
the c - word in 2002 , @entity215 had to do a little rearranging on the fly			2
it quickly and quietly changed its ribald " @entity221 " to the more family friendly " @entity219			0
" @entity0 : company initials explained 10			2
@entity223 what 's wrong with @entity223 ? in @entity226 , nothing			2
in @entity227 , a whole heck of a lot			0
when the @entity230 began planning new @entity232 armed forces in 2003 , they originally called them the new @entity232 corps			0
they hit a big snag , though			0
as @entity237 reported , in @entity227 " nic " is " a colorful synonym for fornication			0
" the coalition quickly changed the name to the @entity242			0
