-- as convicted murder @entity2 comes up for parole review on wednesday , there continues to be an enduring fascination in @entity6 regarding his crimes			1
the murder of pregnant actress @entity9 and four others on august 9 , 1969 , by members of a group known as the @entity2 left a thumbprint on @entity15 pop culture that has influenced music , movies and books			1
one of the latest projects is the book " @entity21 : the @entity23 's @entity22 , the @entity2 , and a @entity24 , " written by a woman who has a personal tie with the story			1
in march 1990 , @entity28 was a young film director who had just been accepted into the @entity29 , the entertainment labor union that represents the interests of film and television directors			1
to celebrate , she went house hunting and discovered there was a place for lease at @entity37 , which happened to be the house where the infamous murders occurred			0
although it was more than two decades later , as @entity28 was unloading boxes , someone was filming something at the house			1
" the day that i was moving in , there was a supposed producer [ on the property ] , " said @entity28 , now an assistant director on " @entity45			1
" " he was taking footage of some of the exterior			0
i just told him not to film me			0
" about two weeks later , @entity28 said she received a letter from that producer , @entity53			1
@entity53 said he was working on a film about the @entity2 murders and the @entity57 family , that he had the blessing of @entity9 's mother , @entity59 , and asked if @entity28 would be interested in helping			1
" being in the business and being 21 years old , i was like ' heck yes , i 'd love to do this			0
' " from there , @entity28 said her life was radically altered : on a filming trip , she went with @entity53 to the house of a detective who had worked on the @entity57 case and who had mountains of police reports , photos , " everything imaginable " piled high on a dining room table			1
" within all those pictures , i came across these two little blue boxes , " she recalled			0
" i opened them up and there were pictures of @entity9 , @entity79 and @entity80 , three of the victims			1
they 'd obviously been taken in the last week of her life			0
along with the slides were the negatives			0
and they obviously had been taken from the house , during the investigation , and never returned to the family			0
" i was so angry			0
he 'd been sitting on these photos for years			0
the second they left the room , i pocketed them , with the intention of returning them to whoever i could find			0
" that person was @entity101 , @entity9 's sister , and @entity28 said the pair went on to strike up a romantic relationship			1
the director said she helped @entity57 work on an unpublished autobiography and continued to be close to the @entity57 family after @entity101 passed away from breast cancer in 2000			1
@entity28 spent the last five years constructing " @entity21 " using what she said are @entity101 's unpublished manuscripts , along with the unpublished writings of @entity9 and @entity101 's late parents , @entity59 and @entity57			1
unlike many memoirs , which are written several decades after the incidents recounted , @entity59 and @entity57 wrote their thoughts while everything that transpired was relatively fresh			1
the stories within , along with how @entity28 fell into the @entity57 family legacy , are yet more fodder for those who remain interested in the tragedy , 40 - plus years later			1
" the murders happened in the middle of the hippie movement and there was a horrible outbreak of violence in one 's home , " @entity28 said of the story 's endurance			1
" couple that with the victims were wealthy and famous , the months and months of speculation as to who did this , only to find out that the @entity2 were right in the middle of this hippie movement			2
i think that scared the hell out of a lot of people			0
" @entity2 and the @entity2 have long been weaved throughout pop culture			2
musician @entity141 is an obvious example of someone who was influenced by the case , as well as @entity146 rock band @entity145 , who draw their name from @entity2 member @entity149			2
@entity28 , while living at @entity37 , sublet her house to @entity151 of @entity152 , where he recorded the group 's second album , " the @entity156 " in a home studio he constructed called " @entity37			1
" ( @entity9 had been hung from a rafter in her living room and the word " pig " was written in her blood on the front door of the @entity165 home			2
) " about halfway through , i went to the house to pick up some stuff , " @entity28 recalled			2
" i was terrified by what they 'd turn the house into and the bad vibes they 'd brought with it			0
they had everything in black , there was a huge cross with blood all over it ; it was just weird			0
" @entity151 reportedly said that after meeting @entity101 , he saw the murders from the victims ' perspective			0
@entity2 has released albums of his own music and spoken word			2
tv specials about the murders have come in waves over the years and now the @entity57 story has started to get the biopic treatment			2
over the past two years , reports have surfaced about three films in the works , all at various stages of development and funding			0
" @entity202 , " a half fiction half nonfiction account , has @entity198 and @entity199 attached and is being directed by @entity200 and written by author @entity201			0
celebrity photographer @entity204 has been linked to a @entity57 biopic called " @entity206 " that reportedly has @entity207 playing @entity57 and @entity204 playing @entity2			1
" @entity209 " star @entity208 is attached to play @entity2 in an upcoming film called " @entity211 , " reportedly written and directed by @entity212 ( " @entity213 , " " @entity214 " )			2
" there 's always hesitation for money to get behind the subject matter , " said @entity200 , who is still trying to secure funding for " @entity202			0
" " [ but ] at its root , people are fascinated by evil and the psychological underpinnings behind it			2
" whether these films come to fruition , even the idea that several different people are actively pursuing this story now is another nod to the influence of the @entity57 case			2
@entity28 said there has already been interest in the film rights to " @entity21 , " but she said that for now , she 's staying put with the survivors ' words , as they told them , on page			1
" i 've gotten a few calls , but i have n't called anyone back yet , " she said			0
" i want to focus on the book now			0
it 's been such a labor of love , i do n't want to get distracted			1
