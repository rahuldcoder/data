-- @entity1 was always on the move as a child			1
the " @entity5 " actress played sports and enjoyed figure skating , so staying active was easy			1
but over the years , exercise took a back seat to @entity1 's evolving career			1
" i think when ' @entity5 ' ended , i just went into a slump , " she recently said			1
we all did , ms. @entity1			1
thankfully the popular government drama is back , available for streaming on @entity15 due to a new deal with @entity17 that sent fans to the couch in rerun ecstasy			1
and @entity1 has returned to her active lifestyle , dropping 20 pounds by focusing on her diet and daily hikes with her dogs			1
@entity1 's had more than one high - profile role since " @entity5 " ended : she played the dog - obsessed mom in " @entity28 , " a @entity30 socialite in " @entity31 " and @entity33 's crazy boss on " mr. @entity34			1
" but @entity1 said @entity37 press secretary @entity36 will always be one of her favorite characters			1
" i feel proud , " she said			1
" i feel like i can die happy ; i did something good			1
not that i 'm planning on dying anytime soon			1
" that 's good , especially considering @entity1 's newest role is spokeswoman for the @entity43 's @entity45 campaign			1
the campaign aims to spread awareness about the no. 1 killer of women : heart disease			1
heart disease kills one woman every minute , according to the @entity43 , and the gap between women 's and men 's survival rates continues to widen			1
@entity1 comes from a long line of " cream and butter " lovers , she said			1
her family 's history of heart disease -- including a grandfather who died of a heart attack -- led her to volunteer for the campaign			1
" i feel if there was one cause that i actually had experience with , and a reason to step up for , it would be this , " she said			2
" i hope i can make a difference in someone 's life			2
" @entity0 spoke with @entity1 about @entity74 for women , how she stays healthy and where she hopes her career heads next			1
the following is an edited version of that interview			2
@entity0 : i love the dress that you 're wearing in the new @entity84 ; that bright red color looks great on you			2
@entity1 : i love it , too ! @entity87 has always been a great color on me , which is why i decided to do the campaign			1
( laughs ) @entity0 : what does that color symbolize for women ? @entity1 : it 's blood			1
@entity87 is just the most standout , powerful color i think there is			2
this famous costume designer i worked with ... said the woman who gets to wear the red dress is the one who 's the most powerful			2
it 's the perfect color to go with this campaign , because it 's all about keeping women strong and healthy and vital			1
survivor of heart failure dedicates birthday to educating others @entity0 : let 's talk about the real reason you 're working with the @entity43			2
@entity1 : i had a bit of a scary experience with my mother who , like most women i think , ignored the symptoms			1
she was driving , going to see the grandkids			2
she was in a motel and probably had what was a very small heart attack -- but a warning			2
she just thought she was having this unbelievable pressure and discomfort in her neck and shoulders			2
she drove 10 hours to @entity130 , @entity131 , and drove right to the doctor because she knew something was wrong			2
he just could n't believe she drove all that way			2
she went right into the hospital and had emergency quadruple bypass surgery			2
for that reason alone , i 'm glad to be part of this campaign			1
@entity0 : you mentioned that many women feel like they have to tough it out and just ignore the symptoms			2
why do you think that is ? @entity1 : i think , as women , we tend to always put our own needs in the back seat to take care of our family or loved ones			1
my mother did just that			2
women feel they need to take care of everybody , ( but ) they ca n't take care of anybody if they do n't take care of themselves			2
@entity162 : know your heart , know the risks @entity0 : how did that experience , and learning more about heart disease , change the way you looked at exercise and nutrition ? @entity1 : i 've lost 15 ( to ) 20 pounds since the summer			1
i 've been doing @entity172 three days a week , and i have three dogs , which gets me out walking every single morning			1
it 's been nice to slim down and bump up the exercise			2
@entity0 : do you have any favorite foods that you 've had a hard time giving up ? @entity1 : i do n't believe you have to give everything up completely			1
i am my mother 's daughter			2
i like macaroni and cheese , all that comfort food			2
i love chocolate , but now i go for 88 % and 90 % dark , dark chocolate to treat myself			0
i go for @entity189 yogurt instead of heavy cream in a recipe			0
it 's kind of a game to see how i can take a recipe and make it healthy and still make it taste good			0
it 's a challenge i 'm enjoying			0
@entity0 : so you like to cook ? @entity1 : i do			1
i 'm not the best cook , but i do like to get inspired -- you know , get the cooking magazines or watch cooking shows			0
basically , i like to have people over to my house , because i usually hate going out to restaurants			0
so i 'm trying to give them more reasons to want to come over to my house			0
like , " oh , my @entity208 , @entity1 's a good cook			1
" @entity0 : what else is a staple in your diet ? what do you have for breakfast ? @entity1 : i 've been doing juicing ... kind of an almond milk mixture			1
and then if i 'm still hungry , i make steel cut oats or have oatmeal with some banana in it or a little agave to sweeten it			0
and that keeps me going			0
i eat a lot of salads			0
whatever i eat is mostly 70 % water			0
i eat tons of salads and greens and peppers and scallions and avocados , my favorite food on the planet			0
i 've been eating a lot of soups and one - pot meals , with quinoa , with chicken breast and tomatoes and thyme			0
i really try to stick to that , and i find i feel better ; i have more energy			0
i 'm 50 - something , and i feel better than i felt 20 years ago			1
@entity0 : what do you do for stress relief ? @entity1 : i 'm trying to learn to meditate			1
i have n't been able to achieve it successfully yet because i get impatient			0
i do these breathing exercises where if i start to feel stressed i breathe in for -- i start at a high number like eight -- and breathe in for eight counts and breathe out for eight counts , until i feel like i can go down to seven and then to six ... and it really does calm me down			0
getting a dog i would highly recommend for anyone			0
animals are great for stress			0
the morning comes , and you have to take those dogs out			1
and i feel better because i do n't feel guilty			0
@entity0 : what would you like to tell women about heart disease ? @entity1 : we only get to be here once ; why not feel the best you can feel ? start making choices that are going to make a difference in your life and the people 's lives around you			1
you just have to consciously be aware that we 're not going to be here forever			0
this is not a dress rehearsal			0
this is all we have			0
and if you look down and you can pinch more than an inch , it 's time to start taking it seriously			0
@entity0 : you 've been called one of the most versatile actors in @entity287			0
what have n't you done that you 'd still like to do ? @entity1 : really ? wow			1
i just signed up for doing a series for @entity291 called " @entity292			0
" @entity293 plays my daughter			0
it 's a multicam series , the first time i 'll be doing that sort of format where i 'm performing in front of a live audience for television			0
i 'm really excited about that			0
there are lots of types of roles that i 'd like to do that i have n't done yet			0
i 've always said i 'd like to play action hero ; a really physically demanding film role would be fun			0
i want to be challenged , work with great people and find better roles			0
like the role that i found in @entity36 ; i like the women that i play who are inspiring to other women			1
that makes me feel good about what i do , that it has a lasting impact on the world			0
i want to do more @entity320			0
i want to continue doing film			0
i want to have this show ( " @entity292 " ) with @entity323 be a great success			0
i just want to keep working , because that 's where i 'm happy , and i think that 's what i 'm supposed to do in this lifetime : keep working and keep experiencing and keep healthy and stay alive as long as i can			0
heart disease often misdiagnosed in women			0
