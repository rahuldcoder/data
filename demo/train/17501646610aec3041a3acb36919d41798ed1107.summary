-- @entity1 has ordered an independent inquiry into investments made by the @entity4 's £ 5.2bn investment fund after the @entity0 revealed that it had indirectly invested in @entity6 , the payday lender			1
the archbishop of @entity9 said he was " embarrassed " and " irritated " that the @entity10 had indirectly invested in @entity6 , the payday lending firm that he has vowed to " compete out " of business by encouraging credit unions to be set up in churches across the country			1
in an interview with the @entity20 's today programme on friday morning , @entity17 said that the amount of church money indirectly invested in @entity6 was about £ 75,000 out of investments totalling £ 5.2bn			1
the church , which claims to have a strong ethical investment policy that explicitly bans companies involved in payday lending , invests in @entity27 , the @entity28 venture capital firm that led @entity6 's 2009 fundraising			1
he said : " now , it should n't happen , it 's very embarrassing , but these things do happen			2
we have to find out why and make sure it does n't happen again			2
" " we ca n't say that we tolerate bad things but we have to live in the real world			0
how do you actually live in the complexity of today			0
" when asked if capitalism was amoral , he said : " i do n't think capitalism is necessarily amoral , it can sometimes be immoral but it is not of itself immoral			0
" @entity1 said an independent inquiry would be launched into how " this serious inconsistency " occurred			1
@entity44 , co-director of @entity45 , the religious think - tank , told the @entity20 that the church had acted within its own investment guidelines			1
" i do n't think the @entity4 needs an inquiry			2
if you look at its policies , they 're very clear			0
the @entity4 can invest in payday loan companies , or those that invest in payday loan companies , provided it 's not more than 25 per cent of their business , " he said			0
" the 25 % figure is exactly the same for pornography , gambling			0
in armaments it 's 10 per cent			0
they 've gone down a route to maximise their profits ; they 're absolutely explicit that they want to make 5 per cent above the rate of inflation			0
" archbishop @entity17 has been a prominent critic of short - term lenders , and has previously supported the introduction of a cap on the amount an individual can borrow from these companies			1
in an interview with the magazine @entity78 published this week , he revealed he had met with @entity79 , founder and chief executive of @entity6 , to inform him of the @entity4 's plans to go head - to - head with him on short - term loans			1
" i said to him quite bluntly we 're not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence , we 're trying to compete you out of existence , " said the archbishop			2
the @entity4 's plan revolves around opening its network of 15,000 church premises to existing credit unions and offering volunteers to help run them			2
the @entity4 has played an increasingly active role in the debate over ethical banking in recent months , both as an investor and because @entity17 was an outspoken member of the @entity101 on @entity102			0

the amount of church money indirectly invested in @entity6 was about £ 75,000 out of investments totalling £ 5.2bn .
the archbishop of @entity9 said he was " embarrassed " and " irritated " by the findings
