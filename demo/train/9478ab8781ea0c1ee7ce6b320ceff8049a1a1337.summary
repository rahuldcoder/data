on tuesday president @entity0 will visit @entity2 to pay his respects to the family of the now - deceased @entity5 and to his successor , @entity6			1
this is a smart move by @entity0 and his foreign policy team			2
after all , the world 's most absolute monarchy and the world 's most powerful democracy have long been allies because they are bound together not , of course , by common values , but by common interests : the ready flow of reasonably priced oil and , more recently , the need to fight jihadist terrorist groups			0
however , a number of significant tensions have arisen in the @entity24 - @entity2 relationship , which a presidential visit likely will help to smooth over			1
the @entity24 - @entity2 marriage of convenience was first initiated on february 14 , 1945 , on a @entity24 warship as it cruised in the @entity29			1
it was on the deck of the @entity32 where president @entity33 first met with @entity2 @entity34 to discuss areas of common interest			0
in the seven decades since that meeting , the relationship has largely worked well for both countries			0
during most of that time , @entity2 provided economic support by ensuring a steady supply of oil and political backing for such @entity24 moves as the effort to repel @entity47 's invasion of @entity48 and to seek a two - state solution to the @entity52 - @entity51 conflict			1
the relationship took a nosedive after the revelation that 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were @entity2			0
but oil has a wonderful way of soothing even the most troubled waters			0
even though the @entity24 is not as dependent on @entity2 oil as many countries are , the @entity2 can choose to raise or lower their oil production and those decisions have substantial effects on global oil prices			1
that 's because @entity2 is the world 's largest oil producer and it has around a fifth of the world 's proven oil reserves			1
today , as oil prices are tumbling to prices we have n't seen since the @entity73 of 2009 , the @entity2 have not lowered their production of oil , which is a great boon to the @entity24 economy , even as the @entity2 take a real hit resulting from their lower oil revenues			1
many suspect that an equally important motive for the @entity2 move is to weaken its arch - nemesis @entity82 , also a major oil producer			0
despite @entity2 oil policies that benefit @entity24 economic interests , the @entity2 - @entity24 alliance -- which was more like a melding of minds under the @entity89 administration -- has in recent years frayed			1
the @entity2 remain irritated that @entity0 did n't follow through on his " red line " threat to take action against the @entity95 regime of @entity97 regime after it used chemical weapons on its population			1
@entity95 is an ally of @entity82			0
the @entity2 are also watching the continuing @entity82 - @entity24 dialogue over @entity82 's nuclear program with great concern			1
they believe that the @entity24 will get played by the @entity82 and will allow them to retain some kind of nuclear capacity suitable for making a nuclear weapon			0
the @entity2 are also still angry that the @entity109 dictator @entity108 was abandoned by the @entity0 administration during the " @entity111 " of 2011			1
how would @entity112 react if the @entity2 monarchy faced its own serious internal opposition : would it too be thrown overboard ? the @entity2 have also long resented the largely uncritical embrace of @entity52 by both @entity118 and @entity119 presidents			0
a common interest that overrides many of these differences is @entity95 , where both @entity112 and @entity123 are threatened by the rise of @entity125 and also of @entity127 's affiliate there , the @entity126 ( " @entity128 " ) front			2
as of early 2014 some 1,200 @entity2 had traveled to @entity95 , of whom 220 had returned to the kingdom , according to a senior @entity2 official			0
as a result , there was great concern in the kingdom about the potential " blowback " problem posed by these militants with battlefield experience acquired in @entity95			0
that 's why @entity2 made it a crime in early 2014 for its citizens to travel to fight in overseas conflicts such as the @entity95 war			2
that move coincided with the appointment of prince @entity149 to head the powerful @entity2 @entity150			0
@entity149 , who @entity127 's @entity152 affiliate tried to assassinate in 2009 , has been an implacable foe of jihadist groups in the @entity155 , which has made him a vital ally of the @entity24			2
in many ways the real news about @entity5 's death , which was long expected -- as was the appointment of @entity6 and his brother @entity162 as crown prince -- was the appointment of the 55 - year - old @entity149 as deputy crown prince			2
this passes the torch of @entity2 succession beyond the gerontocracy of @entity5 's brothers to a new generation			2
it also strongly signals that the @entity2 royal family values the firm stand on jihadist terrorist groups that is favored by @entity149 and by @entity112			0
that 's why @entity2 planes are now taking part in the @entity24 - led coalition to bomb @entity125 positions in @entity181 and @entity95			1
@entity2 and the @entity24 also have a strong interest in stabilizing the situation in @entity152			1
@entity185 rebels have seized the @entity152 capital , @entity187 , and the largely pro-american government of president @entity189 stepped down last week			0
both the @entity2 and the @entity24 regard the @entity127 affiliate in @entity152 as a real threat and they also are both watching with alarm as @entity194 rebels -- whom the @entity2 view as stooges of @entity82 -- have taken over the @entity152 ministries that have played a key role in fighting @entity127			1
there will be much to discuss when the @entity24 president and his foreign policy team meet with the @entity201 and his advisers on tuesday .			2

@entity0 to visit @entity123 to meet with @entity6 , the new @entity2 monarch
@entity205 : it 's an *opportune* time for @entity24 to repair frayed relations
