@entity2 -- " significant differences " remain between world powers and @entity6 in negotiations over its nuclear program , @entity1 foreign policy chief @entity0 said thursday			1
but , @entity13 said , " it 's clear that we both want to make progress			2
" the parties " agree on further discussions to expand common ground , " she said , and have a clear direction going forward			0
negotiations between @entity6 and the so - called @entity20 -- the @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 -- will continue next month in @entity27			1
@entity6 's top negotiator , @entity28 , asserted @entity6 's right to pursue peaceful nuclear energy in his remarks to reporters			1
later , in an interview with @entity3 , @entity28 said there was progress			0
" in two days , we exchanged viewpoints regarding those issues , " he said			0
" it showed both sides are serious in order to move forward in the talks			0
" western powers fear that @entity6 may be trying to build nuclear weapons , despite its insistence that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes			1
the @entity48 has been using sanctions and diplomacy to try to stop @entity6 from producing nuclear arms			1
@entity28 told @entity3 that the removal of " hostile measures " would increase cooperation			0
" we have always said the thing that could break this deadlock is the attitude and cooperation , " he said			0
" the current strategy of pressure could make the talks come to an end			1
the time for and the strategy of pressure is over , but we still have time for talks and new strategies that can bring a new horizon if ( there is ) cooperation			1
" @entity21 secretary of state @entity69 said the sanctions will remain in place			0
" @entity6 now has the choice to make , " she said			1
" will it meet its international obligations and give the world confidence about its intentions , or not			2
" the announcement of further talks followed two days of intense negotiations in @entity2			0
the discussions , scheduled to take a day , were extended into thursday after reaching an apparent stalemate a day earlier			0
speaking after the talks wrapped up , @entity13 said the world powers remain " firm , clear and united " in seeking a swift diplomatic swift resolution to their concerns over the " exclusively peaceful nature " of @entity6 's nuclear program			1
" we expect @entity6 to take concrete and practical steps to urgently meet the concerns of the international community , to build confidence and to meet its international obligations , " she said			1
the world powers laid out " clear proposals " to address the issues at hand and in particular the question of 20 % enrichment			1
meanwhile , @entity6 came with its own five - point plan , which included an assertion that the world recognizes its " right to enrichment , " she said			1
" it 's clear that we both want to make progress and that there is some common ground , " she said			0
however , " significant differences remain			1
" diplomats will arrive in @entity27 on june 17 , for talks on june 18 and 19 which will be based on " a step - by - step approach and reciprocity , " @entity13 said			2
the resolve to continue talks may signal a change in tone , coming after past negotiations that have been marred by threats and allegations of foot - dragging and unreasonable demands			0
wednesday 's meeting appeared to yield little result , with each side submitting dueling proposals			0
@entity6 rejected calls during talks to stop the high enrichment of uranium that can be used for weapons , while the international powers refused @entity135 's demand for an immediate end to sanctions crippling its economy			1
@entity6 threatened this year to close the @entity139 , a vital oil shipping lane , if sanctions were imposed on its exports of crude oil			2
@entity144 , which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal , has said it may attack @entity6 to try to stop @entity135 from developing nuclear weapons			2
the talks come at a critical time for @entity6			1
the country 's economy has been crippled by sanctions imposed by the @entity152 , the @entity21 and the @entity1			0
because 80 % of @entity6 's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports , an embargo by the @entity1 set to go into effect in july will put further pressure on its economy			2
on wednesday , the six world powers made @entity6 an offer for stopping its processing of medium - enriched uranium , which can be used to make nuclear weapons , @entity1 officials said			1
the proposal also called for @entity135 to prove its nuclear program is being used for peaceful purposes as it claims , and comply with @entity168 resolutions , according to a @entity170 official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions			1
asked whether relief from the tough @entity170 sanctions imposed on @entity6 will be on the table , the same @entity170 official said : " there is no expectation it will happen as a result of this meeting			2
@entity6 would need to take significant concrete action first , " the official said			2
@entity6 's counter-proposal included five areas of nuclear and non-nuclear cooperation , state - run @entity185 reported late wednesday			1
a @entity192 spokesman said world powers are offering support for @entity6 economic and agricultural development and the country 's civilian nuclear program in exchange for cooperation			1
another idea on the table is an updated version of an earlier offer to swap enriched uranium for nuclear fuel , @entity1 officials said			0
there had been a proposal to swap most of @entity6 's low - enriched uranium for fuel rods to power a medical research reactor in @entity135			2
the proposals address the world community 's " concerns about the nature of their nuclear program , " said @entity218 , the spokesman for @entity1 foreign policy chief @entity13			1
" obviously , you have various @entity168 resolutions and reports from the @entity222 that have found suspicions that they may be developing a military program , so our proposals on the table address those concerns , " @entity218 said			0
" we hope that they will come back and react positively to those proposals that we 've made and that we can really talk about the substance and get things moving			0
" @entity218 said 20 % uranium enrichment " is one of the issues that 's addressed " in proposals @entity13 put on the table			0
uranium enriched at 20 % is typically used for hospital isotopes and research reactors , but is also seen as a shortcut toward the 90 % enrichment required to build nuclear weapons			0
@entity243 , president of the @entity244 , said all parties should be commended for returning to the negotiating table			0
" a feasible solution is to match tangible , verifiable @entity6 concessions with a delay of the impending @entity1 oil embargo , " @entity243 said in a statement			2
" this would add time to the negotiation clock and buy both sides some breathing space			0
" @entity3 's @entity257 in @entity2 , @entity258 in @entity259 and @entity260 in @entity261 contributed to this report .			0
