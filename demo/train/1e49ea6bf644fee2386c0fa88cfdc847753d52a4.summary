@entity1 , @entity0 -- in most households , photo albums sit on shelves or in drawers for years on end collecting dust			0
@entity9 , son of @entity11 director @entity10 , with his girlfriend , @entity12 , who starred in " @entity13			1
" @entity9 has put his own to much better use -- the 25 - year - old son of @entity11 director @entity10 has turned his collection of family photographs into a feature film			1
during the making of " @entity13 , " @entity10 walked around , camera in hand for a period of twelve months , randomly capturing scenes from his personal life			1
at the end of the year he and his girlfriend @entity12 mounted thousands of these images in a room and wrote a fictional story to accompany them			0
the final product is a most unusual film -- a montage of stills , brought to life through a mixture of dialogue , narration and sound effects			1
the story is that of an impossible love relationship between a 24 - year - old @entity41 girl ( @entity12 ) and a @entity11 teenager played by @entity9 ' half - brother , @entity43			2
" a common thing i hear from people who have seen the movie , is that the first five minutes they 're very worried that they 'll have to sit through eighty minutes of photographs , " @entity10 explained to @entity2 , " but then by minute seven they forget they 're watching stills and become engaged with the characters			1
" watch @entity9 talking about " @entity54			0
" amongst those engrossed by " @entity13 " are some of contemporary @entity11 cinema 's most iconic figures			1
the likes of @entity60 and @entity61 have championed the film for its originality			0
while @entity9 ' family ties have undoubtedly been of much use in promoting " @entity13 " amongst the great and good of @entity11 cinema , his father 's influence on the film itself is minimal			1
although @entity10 is credited as its producer , the renowned director knew nothing of the project during its production			2
" @entity9 showed me the final film and i said ' yikes ! look at that			2
show it to people you trust like @entity60 , @entity83 , just for feedback			0
' that was as far as the consultancy went , " @entity10 told @entity2			0
father and son worked together previously on " @entity89 , " a political short film released on @entity91			1
unlike " @entity13 , " the project involved a more traditional form of collaboration between @entity9 as director @entity10 as producer			1
when asked about their working relationship , @entity10 's response is filled with enthusiasm : " usually one of us throws an idea and the other catches it and throws it back			2
it 's telepathic in a way , we learn a lot from each other			0
" something that really fascinates me , not only about @entity9 , but his entire generation , is how they work with their formats			0
" indeed , @entity9 ' ambition to break with the conventions of filmmaking is in line with a trend emerging amongst young filmmakers not only in @entity11 , but across the world			1
according to @entity9 this willingness to experiment is rooted in technological advances : " [ in the past ] filmmakers had really complicated screenplays and they would wait for grants and finance support			2
" now since video is not as expensive , people are starting to go out and film reality without a script , and then out of that reality , editing it and finding the story as they go			0
" in order to give such creative talent more exposure , the @entity136 recently launched a competition -- the ' @entity141 -- that challenges young filmmakers to step in @entity9 ' footsteps			1
aspiring writers and directors are encouraged to submit an " @entity13 " - like short film made entirely from photographic stills			1
the winning submission will be screened at the premiere of " @entity13 " later this month			0
in addition to promoting his own film , @entity9 is convinced that the contest will create opportunities for his peers : " i 'm thrilled that this short film competition will open doors for filmmakers to play with new languages and demonstrate that the creative process of filmmaking can be more accessible than is often assumed			1
" despite @entity9 ' position at the helm of this innovative community , he says would like to try using more traditional methods on his next film project			2
" well , next time i would like to start with a screenplay and shoot 24 frames per second , " he says with a smile , " i do n't think that you necessarily need to go as far as using still images to find new languages in film			0
" @entity9 may be laying the family photo album aside but the family legacy looks set to thrive regardless			0
with not one , but three @entity179 ( @entity181 's brother @entity180 is also a filmmaker ) mixing up the cinematic landscape , filmmaking may well be in for a make - over			0
entries for the ' @entity185 on november 19th " @entity13 " is released in the @entity186 on november 28th			0
