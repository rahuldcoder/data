@entity0 , @entity1 -- she went to the @entity1 to fulfill her childhood dream of becoming a competitive swimmer			1
@entity6 made the team there , on scholarship , in 2009			2
but the following year , something happened that changed the course of her promising college career -- something her parents did n't learn about until after she died			2
" people were telling us that she had been raped and she wrote it in her journal , " said @entity17 , @entity6 's mother			1
@entity6 committed suicide in 2011			1
in light of a 16 - month investigation by @entity28 's " @entity29 " program , new questions are being raised about what the university knew about the alleged assault , and when officials knew it			1
the president of the university sent a letter to school officials late sunday , saying that he is asking to hire independent counsel to conduct an investigation of the school 's handing of the case			2
the investigation has now also been referred to the @entity45 from the @entity1 @entity46			2
" our detectives will do the best they can with the investigation			0
it was not reported to us until now and we are almost four years behind , " sgt. @entity50 , a @entity0 police spokesman , told @entity2			0
" we can make a difference for others " according to the @entity28 report , in february 2010 , after a night out drinking with friends , @entity6 said she went home with a former university football player -- off - campus -- and had consensual sex			1
months later , she told a rape crisis counselor and wrote in her journal that after the former football player left , another football player entered the room , locked the door and raped her			2
@entity6 's parents say their daughter also talked about the alleged assault with a campus nurse and a campus doctor , 11 months after the attack			1
the school never launched an investigation			0
school officials say they were n't told about the suspected attack by either the nurse or the doctor because of a policy of not reporting sexual assaults without a victim 's consent			0
@entity6 's parents say their daughter had a long history of depression , and in the months after the alleged rape , she grew more and more despondent			1
in 2011 , @entity6 took her own life			1
" we lost our daughter and we can not bring her back , but we can make a difference for others , " her mother said			1
" @entity91 did the right thing " school officials say they later discovered and turned over to @entity6 's parents a transcript of @entity6 's conversation with the rape counselor			1
they also sent her parents a letter asking if they wanted the matter investigated			0
officials say they got no response			0
@entity6 's father , @entity102 , said , " we did not feel supported in this letter			1
this letter was a check - the - boxes letter and , really to be honest , it did not deserve a response			0
" in its defense , the university is raising the issue of privacy			0
" victims of sexual assault need to know that they can seek medical care without the concern that reports will be made to police or campus officials without their consent			0
otherwise some victims will be deterred from seeking medical care , " it said in a statement			0
" we continue to believe that the @entity1 did the right thing in trying to be respectful of @entity6 's parents and determine their wishes			1
we think it is strange and inappropriate for the @entity1 to be criticized for not undertaking an investigation when @entity6 's parents chose not to respond to our request for their input			1
if they wanted an investigation , they simply could have responded or made a report to law enforcement , " it continued			0
according to @entity136 , a federal law that guarantees college men and women are protected equally on campus , universities are legally required to investigate allegations of rape -- even if the alleged victim is no longer alive			0
@entity144 , executive director of the @entity145 , said he does n't get the sense there is any clear evidence of a coverup at this point			0
however , he added : " i certainly feel that the university should have been a little more proactive at trying to bring in information and find out more			0
