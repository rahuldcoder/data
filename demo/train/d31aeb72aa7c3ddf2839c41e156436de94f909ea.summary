conventional political wisdom suggests that immigration reform in a midterm election year has a snowball 's chance in july of getting any traction			1
but maybe that wisdom is n't so conventional			0
some @entity7 say they are warily preparing for the possibility that president @entity9 could use executive action this summer to bypass congressional gridlock and act on immigration reform			1
those changes could include making noncriminals and minor offenders the lowest deportation priorities , a recommendation the @entity18 stressed in its meeting earlier this month with homeland security secretary @entity20			0
@entity7 have good reason to worry , said @entity22 , a professor at @entity23			2
" if i had to predict , i think the president will make some administrative fine tuning of his immigration policies in the hopes of pacifying the immigration activists , " said @entity22			2
rep. @entity29 , @entity30 , worries that day will come in august when lawmakers have headed home to their districts to campaign			0
@entity29 and his staff are cranking up the pace on crafting a measure that would help some undocumented immigrants gain their citizenship through currently existing channels , said @entity40 , the congressman 's chief of staff			0
he declined to say which existing channels the bill would use			0
he added that the measure would also strengthen border security and try to address the backlog of green card applications for permanent status			0
the @entity48 has directed the @entity49 to reexamine the administration 's deportation policy following criticism over the roughly 2 million deportations that have occurred during @entity9 's tenure			2
as recently as last week , the president declined to give a timeline on when those immigration policy reforms might occur			2
should @entity9 use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform ? " the only way to truly fix it is through congressional action , " @entity9 told reporters on thursday			1
" we have already tried to take as many administrative steps as we could			0
we 're going to review it one more time to see if there 's more that we can do to make it more consistent with common sense and more consistent with , i think , the attitudes of the @entity73 people , which is we should n't be in the business necessarily of tearing families apart who otherwise are law - abiding			0
" @entity9 could take matters into his own hands still , some @entity7 , including sen. @entity80 , @entity81 , a potential 2016 presidential candidate who had a key role in helping write a @entity84 - passed immigration reform bill , have said they are concerned @entity9 will soon tire of congressional inaction and use executive action			1
@entity29 hopes to have his measure ready for a debate by june or july			0
" we think that 's the last window for our bill , " @entity40 said			2
that " last window " would likely close because , as @entity48 @entity7 leadership has indicated , using the presidential pen and phone on immigration reform would further sour the relationship between the @entity9 administration and the @entity7			1
while the @entity84 passed its sweeping immigration package last year , the measure has stalled in the @entity7 - controlled @entity48			2
republicans in that chamber have followed a more incremental approach with lawmakers -- like @entity29 -- offering their own measures			0
but @entity7 might be gun - shy about taking up this type of measure , political experts say			2
" there 's a general wariness in the @entity7 caucus to take up immigration reform -- even incrementally , " said @entity109 , deputy editor of the @entity110			1
" taking up immigration has the potential to divide the caucus			0
there are some who want to move forward with immigration reform , but there are also @entity7 who represent @entity7 districts who do n't feel the pressure to take it up			1
" that 's because immigration reform is a thorny topic and not one @entity7 lawmakers are likely to want to embrace in an election year			1
" republicans are trying to balance the prospect of potentially doing very well in the midterms with bringing up legislation or pieces of legislation that could potentially divide the caucus , " @entity109 said			0
tensions between @entity9 and @entity7 on immigration the looming threat of executive action also does little to soothe tensions between @entity9 and @entity7			1
" that will make it almost impossible to ever do immigration reform , because he will spoil the well to the point where no one will trust him by giving him a new law that he will implement the way the @entity153 intended , " house speaker @entity141 told @entity142 earlier this month			1
a tale of two republicans : a story of the @entity7 and immigration reform according to a report in the @entity159 , @entity141 also told industry groups and campaign donors in march at a @entity163 fundraiser that , when it comes to immigration reform , the @entity141 is : " hellbent on getting this done this year			1
" in response to media questions about this statement , @entity141 spokesman @entity167 emailed reporters on friday saying " everyone can tell their editors to chill			0
" " nothing has changed , " @entity167 said			0
" as he 's said many times , the speaker believes step - by - step reform is important , but it wo n't happen until the president builds trust and demonstrates a commitment to the rule of law			2
" still , some @entity184 operatives are banking that @entity7 â € ” who lost big among african - americans , women and @entity189 in the 2012 presidential race â € ” will feel pressure to act on immigration reform			1
the @entity193 said last year it was spending $ 500,000 to help defeat more than a half - dozen @entity194 who the group believes are vulnerable on immigration in november			0
earlier this month , @entity199 @entity198 said race was part of the reason @entity7 in that chamber are blocking immigration reform efforts			1
" i think race has something to do with the fact that they 're not bringing up an immigration bill , " she said			0
republicans who have pushed immigration reform and political experts both say there is now a narrow window for the @entity7 to get something done			1
late spring and summer " might open a small window of time for @entity7 to act , " @entity22 said			1
" if the primaries in spring and summer show immigration is not that big an issue with activists , then @entity7 will feel they can go out on the limb and support reform			1

immigration reform could get a second life under the threat of executive action
president @entity9 has suggested he might act to curb deportations
some republicans backing reform worry the president will act by late summer
the next few months offer a narrow window for the @entity7 to *sidestep* executive action
