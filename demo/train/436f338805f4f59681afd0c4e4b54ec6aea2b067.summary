" everything secret degenerates , even the administration of justice ; nothing is safe that can not bear discussion and publicity			1
" -- lord @entity6 the recent disclosures about the @entity9 's massive and aggressive spying on the world , including @entity12 citizens , along with other scandals showing @entity15 and @entity16 reporters targeted in " leak " investigations , should make us realize that @entity21 's plan for " @entity22 " never died : it merely went underground and changed its name			1
when the @entity22 idea was first proposed by the @entity29 administration after 9/11 , along with a " @entity30 " all - seeing eye logo , it was widely considered a crazy notion , resulting in an outcry			1
that data collection plan , which involved indiscriminate spying on @entity12 , was quickly squelched -- at least publicly			1
the truth , however , was that it was reborn under dozens of massive data collection and surveillance programs within each of our 16 highly secretive intelligence agencies , under a variety of cute acronyms			1
these programs falsely purport to get " novel intelligence from massive data			1
" ( in fact , @entity46 is the actual , self - explanatory name of one such program )			2
few within the national intelligence community complained about the wrongfulness , illegality or ineffectiveness -- let alone the waste and fraud -- of programs that create billions in profit for private surveillance contractors , technology experts and intelligence operatives and analysts			1
but there 's no evidence the @entity46 theory has worked			2
researchers long ago concluded that the @entity46 - type promise of detecting and accurately stopping terrorists through massive data collection was simply not possible			1
opinion : @entity70 is a hero think about how @entity29 administration officials defended themselves from not following up on the incredibly specific intelligence warnings urgently going to director of central intelligence @entity73 and national counterterrorism director @entity75 in the months leading up to 9/11			1
their common response back then was something along the line of : intelligence is like a fire hose , and you ca n't get a sip from a fire hose			1
there was apparently too much for top officials to even read the key memos addressed to them			0
but if intelligence was a fire hose before 9/11 , it quickly became @entity90			1
and now , with so much data ( almost all of it irrelevant ) that has been sucked into government databases and computers , one might liken the " intelligence flow " to a tsunami , with analysts asked to find just the right drop of water			1
in fact , the @entity103 's well - researched series in 2010 on " @entity104 " reported that the @entity9 was collecting and storing around 1.7 billion pieces of information every 24 hours , even back then			0
to switch metaphors , it does not make it easier to find a needle in a haystack if you continue to add hay			0
no one has ever explained why it was left to fellow passengers or alert street vendors , not the " intelligence " agencies , to stop the last four major terrorist attacks or attempted attacks on @entity12 soil			0
when the @entity29 administration 's illegal monitoring was revealed by @entity128 in december 2005 , a cover - up of sorts ensued			1
by labeling it the " terrorist surveillance program , " @entity29 and his closest intelligence officials scared @entity132 and the people into believing that the surveillance was something other than a dragnet -- that it was limited to terrorist suspects , or at least to foreign nationals , and did not encompass all @entity12			1
few believed at the time that such a colossal secret system could eventually be used against @entity12 news agencies and reporters , activists and other officials			0
fast forward to president @entity145 's response to the recent confirmation about the extent of the @entity9 's " metadata " collection of our telephone and @entity152 information			1
keep in mind that the @entity9 is just one of the 16 agencies involved in data gathering and storage			2
opinion : your biggest secrets are up for grabs a courageous person of conscience -- @entity70 -- has now openly confirmed it all but is already suffering official demonization because he felt it important for the wider public to know and debate the magnitude and reach of the @entity12 government 's secret monitoring			0
the disclosures have caused @entity145 and other officials to more or less admit that massive government surveillance erodes citizens ' individual privacy , but they claim that it is a necessary trade - off in the quest for security			1
omitted was proof that such a strategy even works			0
the excessive secrecy and increasing compartmentalization in " top secret america " actually reduces information sharing , which the post 9/11 investigations concluded was the major failure and root cause that allowed the 9/11 attacks to occur			2
some of us even wonder if the 9/11 attacks could have been prevented if @entity191 or a similar channel had existed to get out the serious threats and information that surfaced in the months beforehand but were ignored , unread or became blocked in the " fire hose			2
" secretive spying programs actually harm national security			1
and arguably worse , they pose , as @entity70 stated , " an existential threat to democracy			2
" the @entity202 limits government prerogative by ensuring that a measure of evidence and proof are necessary before police can detain people or search their homes and other areas of privacy			0
the threat to democracy lies not only in the evisceration of the @entity216 's prohibition of unreasonable searches and the @entity219 's guarantee of due process , right against self - incrimination and coerced confessions and other rights that form the backbone of the criminal justice system , but also in eroding freedom of the press , seeing journalists and reporters as " aiding and abetting " the criminal telling of government secrets			2
secrets , by the way , that should n't even be secret			2
few graphs climb as sharply upward as this one tracing the line from 6 million government documents classified " secret " in 1996 to 92 million secret in 2011			0
what will be the figure in 2013 ? will we need someone such as @entity70 to tell us ? has @entity243 's notion that the bedrock of democracy rests on an informed citizenry become as " quaint " as the @entity247 ? the notion that we must choose between abiding by the @entity249 and improving security is fundamentally false , as @entity145 noted when first campaigning for the presidency			1
but his recent response was a flip flop exploiting people 's fear of terrorism to say he can not ensure their " 100 % security " unless people give up their privacy and convenience to allow the massive @entity9 monitoring			2
a lot more than privacy and convenience is at stake			0
what is at risk here is simply the rule of law , whose keystone is the concept of due process , as derived from the @entity275 and enshrined in the @entity202			0
once due process goes , we can wave goodbye also to freedom of speech , freedom of press and freedom of assembly			0
opinion : why we need government surveillance it has happened before			2
one need to only look to the operation of the @entity288 in the late 1940s and ' 50s to recall a time when rights were suspended and to be accused meant to be convicted of a thought crime			0
often considered the smartest man of the last century , @entity293 died with a nearly 2,000 page @entity296 file			0
@entity297 gathered secret information on anyone and everyone of consequence , which gave him power over some presidents			0
in the 1960s , the @entity296 's @entity305 ( counter-intelligence program ) secretly monitored civil rights , anti-war and even feminist groups			0
@entity297 's " black bag jobs " against such public activists as @entity318 , secret blackmailing attempts and nonjudicial " disruption " of these groups is what actually led to the @entity312 investigation of abuses and the creation of the @entity315 , which the @entity9 has now effectively dismantled			0
who wants to go back to the good ole ' @entity325 era ? i 'm afraid that secrecy will inherently continue to degenerate everything and everybody it touches			0
thank goodness for some persons of conscience such as @entity70 and for a little truth getting out !			0

@entity335 : surveillance programs create huge profit for private contractors
@entity335 : more importantly , stopping terrorists through mass data collection does n't work
she says just look at how the @entity29 administration failed on 9/11 despite early warnings
@entity335 : secretive spying programs harm national security and threaten democracy
