@entity4 , @entity5 -- " the tunnels were the most difficult part , especially because the @entity10 range [ is made up of ] immature mountains , " @entity0 , the acting chief engineer of the @entity2 - to - @entity3 road , tells @entity6			1
" this is not dense rock such as granite , this breed is young with soft ground , so they are liable to move			0
" @entity0 is a bear of a man			0
he stands around 6 ' 6 " and has the steely , no - nonsense eyes of an engineer hardened by previous victorious battles with many - a - stubborn environment ( see bottom of page )			0
if his spade - like hands could not carve a passage through mountains he likens to an irritating teenager , you fear there would be no others that could			0
" [ their movement ] is impossible to measure ... but voids and faults occur due to water in the rock , it loosens the joints and seams			1
" but we had some special methods to achieve a positive result , " @entity0 says of the herculean task he helped to deliver			0
special methods that would have come in very handy when you 're faced with boring 30 km of tunnel through big lumps of adolescent rock which are prone to jostling			2
to be more precise this entailed : six complex boring machines and 14 " harvesters " , which transport the rubble and soil away from the mountain face , along with various drilling and blasting methods			0
the 25 - mile highway that joins the coastal @entity61 site in @entity4 with the alpine venues nearly 2000 feet above sea level in @entity3 , entailed many such challenges for the team of designers , engineers and builders assigned to the project			1
erected in just five years the motorway , that ascends the foothills by soaring over the path of a river valley , is something of a technical marvel			0
by working with consultants from @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 a 37 km flyover has been constructed , across all impediments , to deliver travelers from one end to the other in around 30 minutes when free of traffic			1
the tunnels are many , the steel bridges are myriad and concrete support structures , which hold the transport arteries in the air , creep up the snow - capped slopes like a giant , monolithic ivy			2
a new railway line , which also traverses the same physical obstacles , runs parallel to the road too			0
but it 's the cost , which totaled an eye - watering $ 9 billion according to the @entity100 , that led to the road making headlines			1
many in the media touted the freeway , that @entity0 's 150 - man team played a role in building , as the " world 's most expensive road " , with stories abounding of how it would have been cheaper to lay its surface with caviar than the tarmac used			1
the narrative played into a wider questioning of the $ 50 billion spent on the @entity4 project by the administration of @entity5 president @entity121			1
a fear that former deputy prime minister @entity123 alluded to in a report titled " @entity61 in the @entity125 : corruption and abuse in @entity4 , " published last year , where he stated that $ 20 - 30 billion had been spent on " embezzlement and kickbacks			1
" but it 's an accusation that @entity132 -- vice president of @entity133 , the company that delivered the road and rail infrastructure for the @entity136 and sponsor of @entity6 's @entity136 coverage -- totally rejects			1
" in this era of the internet it 's impossible to do something closed and dishonest			0
@entity133 is a global company and we are looked at carefully			0
" we 've had over 1,500 thousand inspections , in such conditions it is impossible to hide something			0
excuses are pointless because everyone can come and see the tenders [ we submitted ]			2
" in politics it 's always easy to criticize others			0
[ @entity123 ] was not responsible for anything , and if he knows where the money went then please show us ! in our country there are organizations that verify this			2
" despite the initial ambition of the task giving him sleepless nights , @entity132 now speaks of his pride in the construction achieved			2
he would not confirm the overall cost , but he told @entity6 the reporting of the investment had sometimes missed the point , in his view			1
" conditions were given to us : we have to carry a certain number of passengers by train and by car in this location			0
" yes , you can compare some figures and individual indicators to suggest something ... but it 's pointless to compare this with a road that runs from @entity184 to @entity185 [ because it 's a different environment ] , " @entity132 told @entity6			1
" we 've built four new train stations and these will serve the population for several generations			0
" down the road in @entity2 there is a tunnel built 120 years ago ... but the decision to build it was right because it has been used so much			2
all infrastructure pays off in this way			0
" there were 10 parts to the @entity133 construction project in @entity4 : two cargo terminals , updating the old @entity2 - @entity200 railway line , building four new stations and then the linking road transport networks , updating @entity4 airport and building a freight and train - servicing plant			1
some say much of the building came at an environmental cost			0
after all , @entity4 sits in close proximity to one of the largest natural parks in @entity212 , a fact that had @entity214 , chief editor of @entity215 , concerned from the start			2
" i think that in any city , roads and social infrastructure should be built regardless of the @entity136 but some of the money should be spent on ecology because the nature of this area was damaged greatly , " @entity214 told @entity6			1
but @entity132 attests great attention was paid to the environment with " special technical solutions " used to keep damage to the national park to a minimum			2
as a @entity233 , @entity132 ultimately sees the @entity4 project and his road as a good news story : " i am glad ... that people will recognize that in our country there is something positive			1
the more that people know , the more tourists will come , and therefore , our infrastructure will be in demand [ for a long time in the future ]			1
" whatever the amount that was invested , the true value -- like that of the 120 - year - old tunnel -- will take a time period greater than the @entity61 to judge .			1

a highway built for the 2014 @entity252 has been *dubbed* the world 's most expensive road
the road links the coastal @entity61 site in @entity4 with the alpine venues
consultants from @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 created a 37 - km flyover along with 30 kilometers of tunnels
" our infrastructure will be in demand [ for a long time ] , " @entity132 , @entity5 railways vice president told @entity6
