@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 are known to be pessimists , so it is probably no wonder that the announcement of record growth in the first quarter of this year did n't excite too many people in one of @entity0 's main shopping areas at the @entity12			1
" i have not seen an economic upswing , " one student said , " nothing has changed for ordinary people			0
" but the economists at @entity1 's @entity19 take a somewhat different view			1
according to figures published on friday they say @entity1 's second quarter economic growth of 2.2 percent -- the largest since @entity1 unification -- is due in part to an increase in private consumption			1
that 's significant because @entity29 's largest economy has often been criticized by its neighbors for exporting a lot , but consuming very little			0
that has not changed even with the positive economic data			0
" if we look at what the statistical office tells us we see that consumption has increased a little , but it is not really what made the difference , " says @entity34 , an economist from the @entity35 in @entity0			2
once again it was @entity1 exports that made the difference			1
with companies like @entity46 and @entity47 recently posting impressive numbers thanks to robust demand from abroad			1
" @entity1 's economy is very competitive , it is now seeing the recovery that is led by demand for products from @entity54 , the @entity55 and other countries , " @entity34 adds			2
but @entity1 would n't be @entity1 if there was n't at least some pessimism even with the record numbers			1
already some experts warn that demand for @entity1 products abroad might wane of @entity54 suffers and economic downturn			1
furthermore , @entity1 's unemployment has remained fairly stable throughout the crisis			2
thanks in part to a government - induced short labor program , that will soon expire			0
the question for many @entity1 is , will the good times last ? @entity34 believes they could : " the flexibility we 've achieved over the last 10 years will also help us in the long term			2
" @entity1 's minister for economics , @entity76 , does n't seem to share his fellow @entity1 ' pessimism			0
he has called the data an " upswing in an xl format			0
" on @entity0 's @entity85 shopping street not many share that view			0
but then again , @entity1 have always fared well with their pessimism -- under promising and often overperforming .			0

@entity1 recorded second quarter economic growth of 2.2 percent
it is the largest growth since @entity1 unification
