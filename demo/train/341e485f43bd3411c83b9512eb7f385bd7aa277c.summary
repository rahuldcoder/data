@entity0 -- the grounds outside the @entity4 @entity3 have long been a place for protests , rallies , and other " expressive events			1
" but exactly just what could be said and where the public could assert its first amendment rights was a source of contention -- at least until thursday			0
that 's when court officials issued new rules			1
the regulations clarify a 60 - year - old law blocking any demonstrations on court property , including the marble plaza that serves as the dramatic gateway to the building itself			1
" the term demonstration includes demonstrations , picketing , speechmaking , marching , holding vigils or religious services and all other like forms of conduct that involve the communication or expression of views or grievances , engaged in by one or more persons , the conduct of which is reasonably likely to draw a crowd or onlookers , " says the revised regulation 7 , which was effective thursday			1
" the term does not include casual use by visitors or tourists that is not reasonably likely to attract a crowd or onlookers			1
" the changes follow a federal judge 's ruling on wednesday tossing out as unconstitutional the previous anti-demonstration rules			2
judge @entity53 said those laws were overly broad and vague , and could implicate any " group activity " on the grounds , including students wearing t - shirts with the name of their school , or tourists gathering on the plaza for a group photo			1
federal law gives individual buildings and agencies , including courts , discretion to set their own security and access procedures			0
@entity71 , @entity72 , had challenged the regulations in court			2
the @entity76 college student was arrested in february 2011 for silently carrying an anti-racism sign on the plaza , although court records show he did so peacefully			1
a court police officer approached @entity71 and three times asked him to leave the plaza , but he refused			2
he was then handcuffed and taken into custody			0
the charges were dropped after @entity71 agreed not to return to the court for six months			0
he later sued , claiming his free speech rights were being violated and that he had a right to protest on government property			0
a @entity89 - based civil rights group , the @entity88 , defended @entity71 in his case			0
the group 's president , @entity91 , called the high court 's new rules set by its marshal 's office " repugnant " to the guarantees enshrined in the @entity98			2
protests , rallies , speeches , and marches in front of the court often number in the hundreds of people , and are traditionally held on the public sidewalk on @entity107 , @entity108 , between the court and the @entity110			1
demonstrators gathered for days during the 2000 @entity113 case over the disputed outcome of the presidential election			0
and those on both sides of the abortion debate rally yearly in front of the court on the january anniversary of @entity122 decision			0
the @entity3 had no comment on the rule changes .			0
