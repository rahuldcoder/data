@entity0 completed his preparations for the @entity2 by claiming the title in @entity4 for the first time with a hard - fought 7 - 6 7 - 6 win over home hope @entity7 sunday			1
it was his 26th victory at a masters 1000 tournament and second in succession after lifting the trophy in @entity14 last week			0
@entity0 , who has won nine titles in 2013 in a remarkable run since returning to the @entity18 circuit after injury in february , has moved to @entity20 in the world off the back of that success			1
it has relegated @entity26 's @entity25 , who will be defending his @entity2 crown when the action starts at @entity29 on august 26 , to third seed when the draw is made later this week			0
only a shock first round exit at @entity33 has interrupted @entity0 's charge to the top of the rankings with three of his successes coming on hard courts on top of his traditional dominance on clay			1
@entity7 , who had beaten @entity42 in the quarterfinals , forced two set points at 6 - 5 on @entity0 's service in the opener , but could not punish his @entity48 opponent			1
@entity0 eventually took the subsequent tiebreak 10 - 8 before another closely fought second set			2
he could not force a single break point on the service of the giant @entity7 , but in the second tiebreaker forged a 5 - 1 lead to take control			2
a typical cross court winner gave @entity0 victory in a shade under two hours , collapsing to the ground in trade mark fashion			2
it was his 15th straight victory on hard courts and he will be the man in form for the final grand slam of the season , looking at add to his @entity67 success earlier this year			0
" this title is very important for me , the @entity2 is still a week away , " he told the crowd after his victory			0
" this is the time to enjoy this one			0
in a few days i 'll start thinking about the @entity2 , " he added			0
but there was an upset in the women 's final as @entity76 recovered from a set down to beat @entity77 2 - 6 6 - 2 7 - 6 in two and a half hours			1
the second seed from @entity80 had beaten @entity77 earlier this year in @entity81 , just after claiming the first grand slam of the season in @entity84			0
but the latest triumph was only her third over the @entity88 in 15 attempts , giving her a morale boost ahead of next week in @entity91 .			1
