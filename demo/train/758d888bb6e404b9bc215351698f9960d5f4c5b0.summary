" but because of a restrictive ruling from a federal judge on tuesday , one thing you wo n't see is @entity18 on the sidewalk bordering the fairgrounds			1

" it 's a sidewalk even the defendants admitted was public			1
in the lawsuit , @entity18 said officers and troopers with batons and handcuffs surrounded him , demanding that he leave the spot outside a ticket gate			1
@entity18 said he chose the spot to make sure his message reached as many people as possible			2
