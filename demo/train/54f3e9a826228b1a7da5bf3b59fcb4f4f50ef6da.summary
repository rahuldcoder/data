guys , i think he means it			2
with no clear frontrunner or obvious " next - in - line " candidate in the field of potential 2016 @entity8 presidential contenders , @entity3 keeps getting asked if he 's thinking about throwing his hat in the ring one more time			1
but it 's not entirely a far - fetched question			2
a poll of @entity15 republicans and independents who lean that way found that @entity3 would be the 2016 frontrunner if he decided to run			1
the 2012 @entity8 nominee has done little to stay out of the limelight , especially this year , as he gets involved in numerous races — including @entity8 primaries — and keeps up a fairly regular routine of media appearances			1
he has assumed a sort of party elder role , and just finished hosting close to 300 major donors and politicians at his third annual @entity30 retreat			2
he was asked as recently as last week on " @entity31 " if he would still turn down another presidential bid -- even if drafted			1
the former @entity34 governor has been accused of flip - flopping in the past , but he 's been pretty consistent on his future : he 's a " no. " 1			2
" i 'm not running , and talk of a draft is kind of silly			2
" -- june 15 , 2014 , on @entity39 's " @entity31 " 2			1
" i 'm far from a kingmaker			2
i 'm just one of those that wants to keep the conversation going and fighting for things i think will make a difference for my 22 grandkids ... i 'm not running			2
" -- june 13 , 2014 , on @entity47 with @entity48 " 3			1
" the unavailable is always the most attractive , right ? that goes in dating as well			2
" -- june 13 , 2014 , to the @entity51 4			1
" i 'm thinking about the people who i want to see running for president			2
... i fully anticipate that i 'll be supporting one of them very vigorously			2
" -- march 23 , 2014 , on @entity58 ' " @entity57 " 5			1
" i 'm not running for president			0
we 've got some very good people who are considering the race			1
and i 'm looking forward to supporting someone who i think will have the best shot of defeating whoever it is the @entity67 put up			0
" -- february 16 , 2014 , on @entity39 's " @entity31 " 6			1
" the answer is no , i 'm not running for president in 2016			1
it 's time for someone else to take that responsibility and i 'll be supporting our nominee			0
" -- february 5 , 2014 , on @entity77 's " @entity75 with @entity76 " 7			1
" i 've had my turn , i gave it two good shots , did n't win and now it 's time for someone else to do it			0
i 'm not running for president			0
i made that clear the morning after the last loss			0
" -- february 5 , 2014 , on @entity77 's " @entity75 with @entity76 " 8			1
" oh , no , no , no. no , no , no , no , no. no , no , no. " -- january 18 , 2014 , to the @entity87 9			1
but look , i want to make sure that we take the country in a different direction			0
i think that @entity93 and @entity94 and @entity95 and @entity96 , and the list goes on , have a much better chance of doing that , and so i will support one of them as they become the nominee			0
" -- january 18 , 2014 , to the @entity87 10			1
" you know it was a fabulous experience , i loved it			0
but we 're not doing that again			0
" -- november 15 , 2013 , on @entity58 ' " @entity108 " 11			1
" i 'm optimistic a @entity8 is going to win in 2016			1
but i 'm not going to be that guy			0
it will be somebody else that takes ... that mantle			0
and more power to them			0
i hope i can help them in some way			0
" -- june 2013 , to @entity77 chief political analyst @entity117 12			1
" i wo n't get a third chance			0
i 'm not doing it again			0
... i 'm not running for office			0
i do n't have a big organization that 's out speaking in my behalf			0
" -- march 3 , 2013 , on " @entity123 with @entity124 " oh , and @entity125 is done , too			1
" i think i 'm over it			0
there 's woulda - coulda - shouldas , of course , that you feel all the time			0
but no , our life is wonderful and i 'm very happy right now , in a good place			0
" -- january 31 , 2014 , on @entity123 with @entity134			1
