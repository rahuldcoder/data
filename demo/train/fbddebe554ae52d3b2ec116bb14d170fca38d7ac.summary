attorneys for the family of a 17 - year - old student found dead in a rolled - up gym mat at a southern @entity5 high school called on authorities thursday to release surveillance video that they say could show what happened			1
@entity10 , they allege , was slain in january -- counter to authorities ' conclusions that the three - sport athlete suffocated in the mat while reaching for a sneaker			1
" there is one eyewitness that we know is available -- it is the video recordings made from surveillance cameras there in the gymnasium where the body was found , " attorney @entity17 told reporters in @entity19 , @entity5			1
" for some unknown reason , this tape has been withheld , " he added			1
gym mat death shocker : body stuffed with newspaper attorney @entity35 , who recently joined the case after representing the family of slain @entity39 teenager @entity38 , said that @entity10 was " murdered , and we intend to get to the truth of what happened			1
" @entity10 was found dead at @entity43 in @entity19 on january 11 , his body resting headfirst in the rolled wrestling mat. a @entity47 autopsy found that he died from positional asphyxia , and the @entity49 determined the death was accidental			1
but a second autopsy , which a private pathologist conducted at the request of @entity10 's parents in june , found that he died because of " unexplained , apparent non-accidental , blunt force trauma			1
" @entity60 's death not accidental , family 's autopsy finds the @entity43 sheriff has declared the case closed , and the @entity63 said in september that it would n't open a civil rights investigation			1
but @entity65 , the @entity66 attorney for the district that includes @entity19 , is reviewing the case and weighing whether to open his own investigation			0
' getting to the facts ' @entity17 acknowledged thursday that @entity65 's office has surveillance material from the school and that he believes @entity65 is " making every effort to establish what in fact the ... tapes may show			2
" still , @entity17 said , he does n't know whether @entity65 has all the relevant tapes , and he said his team should be permitted to see them -- which he said has n't yet happened			0
" i 'm ( awaiting ) some word from ( @entity65 ) as to whether or not " he 'll release the tapes to the team , @entity17 said			0
@entity65 released a statement saying that " this is about getting to the facts and the truth , and we want the @entity10 family and the community of @entity19 to have confidence in the process			2
" " i am cognizant of time , and we continue to move the process along , " he said			0
@entity17 and @entity35 , watched by a few dozen supporters of @entity10 's family , made their comments on what would have been @entity10 's 18th birthday			1
before the news conference , the supporters held signs calling for answers in the death , and chanted refrains like : " no justice , no peace ! " @entity10 's father , @entity107 , spoke briefly , asking authorities to give his son " a good present today			1
" " give us the videotape , " @entity107 said			0
@entity113 organs removed the attorneys ' plea also came after @entity10 's parents told @entity117 this week that their son 's body and skull had been stuffed with newspaper before burial			2
that discovery was made during the second autopsy in june			0
the private pathologist , dr. @entity125 with @entity126 in @entity39 , told @entity117 that every internal organ from the pelvis to the skull was gone when he opened up the teen 's remains			0
" we have been let down again , " @entity107 told @entity117			0
" when we buried @entity10 , we thought we were burying @entity10 , not half of @entity10			2
" during an autopsy , internal organs are generally removed and examined before being returned for burial			0
@entity47 spokeswoman @entity140 told @entity117 that after the first autopsy , " the organs were placed in @entity10 's body , the body was closed , then the body was released to the funeral home			1
" the funeral home would not comment to @entity117			0
but in a letter to the @entity148 ' attorney , funeral home owner @entity145 said his firm never received the teen 's organs			2
@entity145 wrote that the organs " were destroyed through natural process " due to the position of @entity10 's body when he died , and " discarded by the prosector before the body was sent back to @entity19			2
" a prosector dissects the body for pathological examination			0
@entity17 said thursday that his team would take a close look at what happened to the body between the first autopsy and the burial .			0
