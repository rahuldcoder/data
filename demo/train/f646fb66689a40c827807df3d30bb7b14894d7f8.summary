@entity0 , @entity1 -- stepping into the containment dome of @entity4 no. 3 is almost surreal			1
it 's like entering a movie set , but instead of walking by wooden props , we 're passing through an 11 - foot - thick concrete - and - steel wall			2
this is the nuclear facility that @entity1 gov. @entity11 wants to shut down , the long - time target of both anti-nuclear and environmental activists , the nuclear power plant that sits only some 25 miles from @entity16			1
just a strip of yellow tape warning of radioactive danger separates me , my producer @entity21 and cameramen @entity22 and @entity23 from white - uniformed technicians who are removing groups of nuclear fuel rods ( 204 rods are packaged together in each fuel assembly ) and inserting new ones , a month - long process that takes place every two years			1
armed guards stand behind us , even after we have cleared three levels of tight security and a radiation briefing			0
getting into the @entity37 is easier , far easier			0
around my neck are two @entity4 security passes and two dosimeters that will measure the amount of radiation i receive : one will be sent for analysis to a laboratory , the other is an electronic - arming dosimeter , a real - time radiation detector set to beep if i were to receive a dose of 100 millirems per hour			1
( during our radiation briefing we are told a chest x-ray delivers 8 millirems			0
) a massive 100 - ton steel plug hangs from cables			2
below , workers surround the nuclear core , which is underwater			2
they control machinery that delicately moves the fuel assemblies through a water - filled canal connected to the spent fuel pool , where rods filled with uranium pellets cool down for years			2
there are nearly 50,000 uranium pellets in each fuel assembly collection of rods			0
pumps keep water circulating into the pool so it remains at a temperature of 100 - degrees fahrenheit ( compared to the 2,100 degrees that nuclear fuel can reach before it would meltdown )			1
so , keeping the power on here is essential to averting disaster			2
@entity4 receives its power from the same electric grid to which it contributes			1
if the power goes out -- and it briefly did only three weeks ago due to a utility technician 's error -- backup diesel generators kick in to keep the plant functioning			1
that 's exactly what happened during the recent outage			0
each of @entity4 's two reactors have three auxiliary diesel generators , and then there are separately located backups to those backups as well as diesel - driven fire pumps that can keep the spent fuel rod pools filled			1
it 's all designed to avoid the kind of catastrophe that occurred at @entity96 's @entity95 plant			2
plant managers spend lots of time thinking about potential emergencies and how to avert them			2
" our plant is designed to handle the worst natural disaster			0
we have many layers of redundancy , " said @entity104 , director of operations at @entity4			1
the plant is built to withstand at least a 6.0 - magnitude earthquake , greater than the region has ever experienced , though researchers at @entity112 's @entity111 warn a 7.0 is not out of the realm of possibility since they have determined the plants is built near the intersection of two active seismic zones			1
" we believe that we can handle a ( magnitude ) 7 earthquake , " said @entity118 , vice president of operations for @entity119 , the plant 's owner			0
" the theoretically highest predicted earthquake in this area would be of a magnitude where our plant design will be able to withstand that and we would be able to respond and shut the plant down in a safe manner			1
" in truth , @entity4 's operators say , a severe hurricane is a far more likely event , for which they also have extensive contingency plans			2
during the month - long refueling process at unit no. 3 , the containment dome 's hatch remains open			0
to be prepared for a natural hazard -- or even the possibility of an attack -- @entity4 keeps a giant plug sitting on a massive forklift nearby that plant workers can shove into place within 15 minutes to protect the reactor			1
such precautions and procedures are part of @entity119 's application to the @entity152 for a 20 - year operating license renewal			1
unit no. 3 's license expires in 2015 , unit no. 2 in 2013			0
( @entity4 shut down its original reactor , no. 1 , in 1974 )			1
back inside the dome , after technicians vertically lift a 12 - foot fuel assembly from the nuclear core , they turn it horizontally and move it along a water - filled canal to the adjacent building that houses the spent fuel pool where the assembly is positioned in an upright rack for cooling , which takes years			2
the pool about 40 feet deep , surrounded by 6 feet of concrete on all sides , and it has a greenish tint to it			0
workers stand on metal ramps overhead , prepared to accept the next spent fuel assembly			0
my electronic arming dosimeter registers a .3 millirem , its first detection of radiation			0
in a locked , plexiglass - enclosed case not far from the pool sit brand new fuel assemblies fresh from @entity184 , waiting their turn for a swim to the nuclear reactor core			2
as precise as the underwater operations are , they are not without flaw			0
in unit @entity193 , @entity4 's other active plant , there has been a relatively small leak during refueling that officials say has let out as much as eight gallons of contaminated water a day into the containment dome area			1
" we have n't found the exact location of the leak to be able to do the repair and stop it , " said @entity118			0
" we 're working with a couple of firms			0
right now there 's a technique being used in @entity206 that we 're trying to see if it would work here and we 're going through that evaluation right now			0
" @entity118 says the leak is neither cause for concern nor a safety hazard since it 's within one of the reactor domes			0
as we leave the spent fuel pool , we hand in both our dosimeters for analysis before stepping into a device that detects if we 've picked up any contaminants on our clothing or shoes			0
i step in , push my chest against the oversized metal detector style contraption , wait an uncomfortably long 30 - seconds , then do the same with my back up against the device			0
my heartbeat slows as i step through the locked security gate and walk back towards the largest part of the nuclear plant : the power - generating room			1
this is where the steam that 's created from the nuclear reactor flows through huge tubes to turn giant turbines that power the generator that produces the electricity @entity4 sends off to the grid			1
each plant generates 1,000 megawatts of power , providing as much as 30 % of the electricity for @entity1 and @entity245			1
since unit no. 3 is undergoing refueling , workers are busy maintaining and upgrading the turbines and generator			0
both @entity4 plants are pressurized water reactors , as opposed to the crippled @entity95 plant in @entity96 , which is a boiling water reactor			1
pressurized reactors are n't necessarily safer than boiling water reactors , they just employ a different technique to harness the heat generated by nuclear fission to produce steam			0
as the nuclear crisis unfolds in @entity96 , @entity4 officials say they 're hoping for details that might help operations here			1
" undoubtedly we will come back with lessons learned to continue to improve our safety margins and increase them even further , " said @entity266			0
the @entity152 is initiating a safety review of @entity4 and all other @entity271 nuclear power facilities , as part of its response to the crisis in @entity96 .			1
