-- think that president @entity1 has done a back flip on @entity3 and @entity4 , gotten that old - time religion and is now a convert to the " let 's kill them wherever we find them " approach of his predecessors ? think again , or at least lay down until the feeling passes			1
indeed , stripped to its essence , what the president has outlined is n't some grand strategy to transform the region or even to " ultimately destroy " @entity18 ; it 's a much narrower transactional one to protect the homeland			1
and here 's why : the speech the president gave is quite consistent with who he is and what his priorities have been all along , particularly relating to counterterrorism			1
sure he 's now morphed from a desire to avoid militarizing the @entity31 role in @entity4 to a new willingness to do so			1
but the reason he 's traveled down that road is critical			2
it 's not some ideological crusade , fascination with nation - building or democratization of a new @entity40			1
@entity18 now poses a threat to the homeland , a contingency that could not only directly threaten @entity31 but destroy his presidency as well			1
and the one area where @entity1 has been prepared to be ready to take on risk is in counterterrorism			1
anti-terrorist in chief indeed , it 's hardly a secret and it is a disappointment to many of his own supporters that this president long ago morphed into a much more disciplined and risk - ready anti-terrorist than his predecessor			1
he doubled down in @entity60 ; used drones 10 times more than president @entity62 ( 431 targeted killings ) ; authorized the mission that killed @entity65 ; dismantled much of @entity67 central ; and has been involved in a giant game of @entity69 these past six years against bad guys from @entity71 to @entity72 and @entity73			1
@entity18 might not be a threat to the homeland now			2
according to the @entity78 's @entity77 for 2013 , there were 17,891 global fatalities because of terror ; only 16 @entity31 were among them			1
but who knows how @entity18 might direct its efforts in the future ? it 's richer , smarter and more capable than @entity67 in many respects			2
and there 's quite a bit of time left on @entity1 's presidential clock			1
he simply can not afford to play loose on this issue			0
indeed he must be perceived and in fact deliver on doing everything he possibly can to preempt and prevent @entity18 from striking here or in the region against @entity31			1
he was n't 20 seconds intro his speech before he said the following : " as commander in chief , my highest priority is the security of the @entity31 people			1
" and the polls demonstrate pretty conclusively that @entity18 is on @entity31 's radar screen and people see it as a real threat			1
grand strategy ? not really we 'd love to believe that all parts of the strategy the president laid out wednesday night can work seamlessly in pursuit of that ultimate presidential responsibility			2
but it 's hard to imagine they will			2
securing an end state in @entity3 and @entity4 that will somehow lead to good governance and reduce the grievances on which @entity18 feeds seems a real stretch			0
it wo n't happen quickly , easily or probably at all , certainly not without @entity4 and @entity3 taking real ownership			0
and getting a bunch of constrained @entity125 @entity124 allies on board who seem at odds with one another -- namely @entity130 , @entity131 and the @entity132 on the one hand and @entity134 and @entity135 on the other -- also seems very unlikely			0
certainly plans to get @entity124 on the ground to actually fight against @entity18 -- now bandied about by some very smart people -- are also a bridge too far			0
providing bases and money to train @entity4 to fight , sure ; sharing intelligence , absolutely			0
but we need to keep our expectations very low			0
any kind of sunni arab state coalition of the willing actually willing to enter the fight against @entity18 on the ground seems like a fanciful scene out of a bad @entity151 movie			0
the only way the @entity124 states are willing to fight @entity18 ? to the last @entity31			1
is the enemy of my enemy my friend ? @entity158 is another problematic piece of the puzzle -- and was not mentioned at all in the president 's speech			1
the administration has a short - term coincidence of interest with @entity158 against @entity18			0
we 've seen this movie before in the first @entity168 in the early 1990s when @entity158 condemned @entity170 's invasion of @entity171 and in @entity60 in 2001 , when elements of the @entity173 were on the ground training and fighting alongside @entity31 special operations forces to bolster the @entity177			1
but the emphasis should be the on short term			0
@entity180 has a different vision for @entity3 and @entity4 than we do			0
consider the machinations in @entity183 over the past decade by @entity184 , head of the @entity185			0
so any notion that the enemy of my enemy is my friend just does n't add up in this case			0
@entity158 is n't @entity31 's friend			1
whether the administration can fashion an effective fighting force out of scores of @entity4 militias is a very arguable proposition			0
@entity196 's road test it			2
but it will take time			0
in the interim , we will have enough difficulty operating against @entity18 on our own without good intelligence and special forces on the ground , and getting at @entity18 in the midst of a civil war			0
in the end , whether this approach works or not , the essence of the president 's policy will end up being driven by @entity31 air power : destroy @entity18 from the air , certainly as they move across the border into @entity3 and then as the intel improves , attack them in @entity4 , too , and empower our new allies to do so on the ground			1
after more than a decade of the war on terror against @entity67 , if you asked us what the most immediate threat to the continental @entity31 is , we would n't say @entity18			2
we 'd say @entity225 with its demonstrated capacity to make bombs and to try to attack @entity31			2
our point is n't to deny the success of counterterrorism efforts ; it 's to suggest that hitting one jihadist group usually means that affiliates and derivatives emerge			2
and that 's likely to happen even with great success against @entity18			2
this really is the long war			0
fighting these people is like breathing			0
you just ca n't stop			0
we think the president gets all this			0
and frankly , there really is n't much more he could have said or in fact much more he could be doing			0
in the end , this is not about grand plans , designs and hopes to transform the @entity40 -- one broken , angry and dysfunctional region of the world			2
for @entity31 , it 's about how to continue our track record : no @entity67 - directed attacks on @entity31 soil in 13 years			1
you can dress it up all you want with allies , coalitions , political reforms and inclusiveness			0
but @entity1 knows that in the end when stripped to its essence , it 's about killing bad guys before they have a chance to kill us .			1

has president @entity1 reverted to @entity62 's policy on terrorism and the @entity40 ?
@entity273 says the president instead is narrowly *focused* on preventing homeland terrorism
he says @entity1 long ago put his faith in counterterrorism , *including* drone strikes
@entity1 knows his presidency will be judged partly on whether he kept @entity31 safe , @entity273 says
