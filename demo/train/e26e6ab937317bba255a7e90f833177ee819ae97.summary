on thursday , @entity9 sheriff @entity8 announced that authorities believe the " long journey " may be nearing its end , as it 's " highly , highly probable " that @entity12 , a convicted sexual predator who died in prison last year , is the prime suspect in the quarter - century - old case			1
in february 1989 , the blond - haired , brown - eyed sessions , a junior at the @entity16 , donned red sweatpants and a white @entity19 sweatshirt , put on her @entity20 and went for her routine hourlong jog down @entity23 's main street toward a dirt trail that cut through the woods			1
normally , her roommate would accompany her , but on that day , she had to study and @entity27 jogged alone			2
the 20 - year - old economics major never came back , and aside from witnesses who saw a woman resembling sessions walking before dusk , @entity27 left no trace -- no clothing , no @entity20 , not even her gold @entity36 watch			1
@entity12 lived in the area at the time , and @entity39 described him as a man with a " horrible history of violent crimes against women -- murder , rape , kidnapping			2
" while there wo n't likely be a dna connection , authorities feel circumstantial evidence is overwhelming , she said			0
@entity12 was serving a life sentence for first - degree murder when he died last year			1
speaking before the backdrop of a wooded area in @entity23 where murder victim @entity57 's body was found in 1992 , @entity39 told reporters a dig was conducted a week and a half ago because the area was a known " dump site " for @entity12 ' victims			1
in 2012 , @entity50 tied @entity12 to @entity57 's disappearance			1
police unsuccessfully tried to interview @entity12 before he died , but after his death , they gathered items from his cell , including a journal entry on a calendar that read " 2/9/89 " -- the date @entity27 disappeared -- with " no. 2 " scrawled on both sides of the notation			1
police believe it 's an indication that @entity27 was @entity12 ' second victim			1
" it may not be a smoking gun , but it 's close , " said the missing woman 's father , @entity27			1
according to police and the family , other factors connect @entity12 to @entity27 ' disappearance			1
he delivered scaffolding to a construction project along @entity27 ' jogging path and did n't work the night of her disappearance , for example			2

he murdered in this community , " @entity39 said			0
@entity39 asked the media to distribute photos of @entity12 at different points in his life , study the timeline of his life and crimes and " go back in time 25 years			2
" she also encouraged anyone with information about @entity12 -- no matter how trivial it may seem -- to call 352 - 384 - 3323			1
authorities are offering $ 1,000 for any information leading to an arrest			0
" we want to have this last piece of conclusive connection so the family can at least have some peace , " the sheriff said			0
" there 's no risk			0
thank goodness he 's dead			0
" the missing woman 's mother , @entity116 , appeared at the press conference with the sheriff , at times smiling and optimistic , at other times teary			2
she thanked numerous people for their help over the years and conceded that police were " searching for a very small needle in a very big haystack			0
" still , she clearly had hope			0
" she 's my masterpiece , " @entity116 said			0
" it would be nice to be able to put her to rest after all these years			0
" @entity131 -- who , like some of the law enforcement officers on the scene , wore a baseball cap saying , " the search for @entity1 " -- encouraged anyone with the even " the vaguest information that we can use " to come forward and let authorities assess whether the information is useful			2
" this is for real			0
this is our chance to close this case , " he said			0
