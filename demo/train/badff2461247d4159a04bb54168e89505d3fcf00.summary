he voluntarily surrendered thursday at an @entity24 field office in @entity15 , the sources said			0
@entity11 is a former employee of @entity26 , the @entity28 's prime environmental management contractor at the @entity29 , prosecutors said			1
the indictment states that @entity11 , " having possession of , access to and having been entrusted with sections of ' barriers ' and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of gaseous diffusion ... having reason to believe that such data would be utilized to injure the @entity6 and secure an advantage to a foreign nation , did communicate , transmit and disclose such data to another person			1
" the transfer took place january 26 , the indictment alleges			2
@entity11 is also charged with converting the material and " restricted data " to his own use			1
he began doing so on about october 17 , 2006 , and continued through january , prosecutors said			0
prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them			0
@entity11 's attorney , @entity58 , said outside court thursday that @entity11 's job was to break rods " into little pieces " and throw them away			1
@entity58 said @entity11 had a security clearance , but @entity58 did not believe it was a high - level clearance			1
the government alleges that in january , @entity11 attempted to sell the " pieces of scrap " to someone he thought was a @entity68 agent -- but in reality was an undercover @entity24 agent , @entity58 said			1

each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine			0
" while none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization , the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands , " @entity84 , assistant attorney general for national security , said in the @entity1 statement			1
one government source said the materials involved are not the " crown jewels , " but they should not have been taken from the facility			0
a " barrier " is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process , according to nuclear energy officials , but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job			2
sources told @entity0 that federal authorities have been following @entity11 and investigating the case for at least six months , after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material			2

a government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of @entity11 's alleged intentions six months ago , the @entity24 and @entity28 launched a joint investigation			1
