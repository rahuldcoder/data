@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 struggles to lift a book			1
it 's 4,000 pages , more than a foot thick and one of the dozens of government reports over the last decade assessing the nation 's first offshore wind farm			1
" it 's thicker than the health care bill , " chuckles @entity3 , the 56 - year - old ceo of @entity11			1
@entity3 's laugh has now turned into a celebratory smile			1
after a vicious nine - year fight on @entity17 , @entity3 has finally won approval of his wind farm to be built in the iconic waters of @entity21			1
interior secretary @entity22 on wednesday signed off on the project			0
" we 're trying to pioneer a new path to move @entity26 forward in obtaining cleaner energy , a healthier environment and putting people to work to harness the inexhaustible winds that we 're blessed with off the @entity11 , " he said			1
it has been anything but easy			0
@entity11 has spent more than $ 45 million -- most of it from @entity3 's own pockets -- since 2001 , when the project first sought a permit			1
his opponents have vilified him over the years as a greedy corporate energy man pillaging the pristine waters of the @entity21			0
they say he 's interested , not in green energy , but the green of the @entity26 dollar			2
@entity3 has refused to disclose potential earnings for his company ; critics say @entity11 stands to gain hundreds of millions in tax credits and subsidies			1
@entity3 's hair has gone from black to gray since the fight began			1
and while the @entity11 has debated the project , countries like @entity52 have built their own offshore wind farms , forging ahead of the @entity26 in wind energy			1
@entity3 's opponents have come from the left and right			1
they have ranged from one of the most powerful senators in the nation 's history -- the late sen. @entity59 -- to billionaire fossil fuel heavyweight @entity63			1
" i 'm for wind energy , " @entity59 famously said			2
" but we ought to do it right			0
" the @entity59 compound in @entity69 will have a view of the 130 wind turbines , located several miles from the shore			0
see how the views on the @entity11 will change @entity63 , founder of the @entity75 and a resident of the @entity11 , sits on the board of @entity3 's nemesis , the @entity79			1
he 's reportedly contributed more than $ 1.5 million to try to stop @entity11			1
@entity63 and his @entity75 have accused @entity3 of duping the region , saying the @entity11 had better prepare for skyrocketing electricity prices			1
the price per kilowatt hour offshore is far higher than on land			2
" this will only benefit one individual , and that 's the developer himself , @entity3 , " said @entity84 , @entity63 's chief spokesman			1
" @entity3 can try to wrap himself around wind all he wants			1
that dog will not hunt here			0
" who is this wind man who challenged the nation 's biggest power players -- and won ? the son of a @entity1 grocer , @entity3 says he decided to get into the energy business while waiting in line to get gas during the @entity100 energy crisis of the 1970s			1
it was a wise decision : he consulted for power plants and made tens of millions of dollars by converting old power plants to natural gas facilities			1
he won over communities and brought in hundreds of jobs			0
in all , his group , @entity107 , had seven @entity109 power facilities ; six of them were natural gas plants			0
he sold out in 2001 and with his millions turned his focus , and energy , to wind			1
" he did n't buy an island in the @entity118			0
he did n't sit on his money , " said the rev. @entity119 , a co-founder of @entity120 , a @entity17 - based organization that has supported the wind farm			1
" he decided to do something noble with it			2
you have to admire him for that			0
" added @entity126 , the research director for @entity127 : " he 's amazingly tenacious and knows that it 's a good project in the right place and a good thing for the economy and the planet			0
... we 're going to throw a party and toast @entity3			2
" @entity126 says every major environmental group has defended @entity11 , because the @entity26 needs to move away from its dependence on oil and expand its clean energy base			1
@entity3 's biggest mistake , he says , was a belief that the project would be immediately embraced			2
the region 's @entity143 base and constant support of green energy made it seem like a sure deal			2
" he underestimated what powers would come to bear on the other side , " @entity126 said			0
" it was a much tougher nut to crack than he thought			0
what it really boils down to is a few really rich local folks do n't want it			0
" for two years , @entity157 posed as the head of the @entity79			0
though a foe of @entity3 's , @entity157 admires him as a formidable opponent who has the quintessential @entity26 story -- a hard - working man who built a fortune out of nothing			2
" not only does he get an @entity164 for effort , he gets an ' a-plus , ' " said @entity157 , who has 35 years of experience in the energy market			1
" he 's shown himself to be very focused and very committed			0
" @entity3 graduated from @entity169 with a degree in public communications			2
@entity157 says he used that to his advantage in the @entity11 debate : " he 's a master at how you spin things			2
" @entity157 's main beef with @entity3 is the possibility of higher energy costs on the @entity11			1
" my sensitivity is my electric bill , " he said			0
" if we could really believe that prices would be lower , as he initially said , i do n't see why this would n't be more popular			2
" @entity11 has said it ca n't guarantee lower prices , but the energy will be cleaner			1
the head of @entity190 , one of @entity0 largest utilities , recently told the @entity192 that electric prices could go up in coming years due to renewable energy			1
that 's another red herring from critics , says @entity197 , a professor of international environmental policy at @entity200 's @entity199			2
" the prices wo n't skyrocket for the local people			2
that 's just non-sense , " said @entity197 , part of a team that won the @entity205 in 2007			0
" there might be a small rise , but it would be relatively small			0
" he applauded @entity3 for not bowing out in the face of withering criticism : " @entity3 has to be one of the most persistent people who truly believes in the goal that he 's set for himself			1
most people would have pulled out long ago			0
" the wind farm turned into the most heavily vetted energy project in the nation , with dozens of public hearings and 17 state and federal agencies weighing in			1
the 130 turbines , spaced a third - to a half - mile apart , will cover about 25 of the 500 square miles of @entity21			0
they will stand more than 40 stories tall and provide up to 75 percent of the power to the @entity11 and islands			2
see the location of the wind farm @entity3 often visits his family home in @entity233 on the @entity11			1
does he lie low while there because of the heated emotions @entity11 has stirred ? " not at all , " he said			2
he finds just the opposite reaction			0
locals come up to him in shops and restaurants			0
keep going , they say			0
we know it 's hard			0
the @entity11 ceo admits he never anticipated the battle would drag on for nine years			0
that 's too long , he says , for everyone involved -- from the affected communities to the investors to the government			0
the @entity79 has vowed to file a lawsuit to try to stop the project			0
@entity3 says the group can try if it wants , but the @entity79 should be prepared to lose again			0
he 's now the pioneer behind @entity0 ' new revolution : offshore wind			1
he hopes to begin construction later this year , with the project completed by the end of 2012			0
" when you believe in your heart that you have the right project at the right place at the right time , " he said , " you just keep putting one foot in front of the other			0

@entity3 faced a decade of criticism over his plan for nation 's first offshore wind farm
@entity3 made tens of millions in the energy market before focusing on wind farm
supporter : " he did n't sit on his money . he decided to do something noble with it . "
critics say @entity11 residents should brace for higher electric prices
