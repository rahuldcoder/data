-- his father is a nuclear engineer and his uncle was a high - ranking politician in @entity5 , but @entity6 is forging an entirely different career path with his own kind of power			1
at an imposing 6ft 5in tall , he has burst onto the tennis scene this year with a fast - developing all - round game based upon his booming serve -- he has already registered the third - fastest delivery on record			1
the 20 - year - old is the highest - ranked @entity15 tennis player in the history of the @entity18 listings , he has won his first top - level tournament , and reached the fourth round of only his second grand slam event in @entity22 in january			1
these are impressive numbers at such a young age , but they pale in comparison to the statistics of the man who has had a massive influence on @entity6 's burgeoning career			1
@entity31 won 14 grand slam crowns , 64 singles titles and spent a record 286 weeks at no. 1			1
he also helped launch @entity6 's career in february when they met in @entity37 at a tournament where the @entity40 legend himself triumphed twice			1
will bigger balls slow down the rocket men of tennis ? " i met him and then went on a nine - match winning streak , so it was a very inspirational moment , " @entity6 told @entity46 's @entity45 of his breakthrough victory and subsequent final appearance in @entity49			1
" it was another level of an experience for me , getting to meet someone you looked up to so much and watched for so many hours , getting to meet the person in the face to see what kind of person he is			2
" @entity6 was so struck by that meeting that he still carries on tour a picture of the two that @entity31 signed and framed for him			1
" i looked up to him , i looked at all his matches , watched everything more than once -- he really was an inspiration			2
he was an inspiration for putting so much time behind that serve , " he said			2
@entity6 has an impressive arsenal of his own			1
as well as its pace -- clocked at 153 mph ( 246 kph ) in a @entity78 tie at altitude in @entity80 in march -- he has a variety that many opponents will struggle to counter , according to @entity84 's new no. 1 @entity83			1
" he 's got all the serves that anyone else that i 've ever seen does , " fish said after losing to @entity6 in the @entity49 semis			2
" from the waist down he has the strongest legs of anyone i 've seen			0
you can tell he still has some growing to do in his upper body , and it 's a scary thought to think he 's got ways to improve			0
" fauna fight : the battle over @entity98 @entity99 , @entity6 's final conqueror that week and formerly the world 's fastest server , was also impressed			1
" the good news for him is he 's going to be able to learn on the job because that serve is going to win him a lot of matches			0
it 's one of the bigger serves i 've seen , " the @entity40 said			0
but @entity6 knows that a lightning serve is not enough to guarantee success against the world 's elite players			2
" there is a lot of effort going into the rest of my game			0
i 'm trying to develop for those days when you play number one , two , three , four , five in the world and they get all those serves back			0
i 'm preparing myself as much as possible to be at the top of the game			2
" if he had n't made the jump from junior ranks , and that was by no means a certainty when he began this year ranked 156th with doubts about his fitness and on - court attitude , @entity6 might have been pursuing a different profession			1
" i was big in academics so i think i 'd be sitting behind a desk calculating with numbers			0
i want to finish university , i want to get a degree in finance , " said the @entity5 - born player , who turned down a scholarship at the @entity140 to focus on tennis			1
" i want to at least have that education so i could have those options and choices because i really did enjoy that , especially with the calculator			0
" is @entity151 's clay domination good for tennis ? it was a tempting option , as he was not a top name among the juniors , but @entity6 's career developed under the tuition of @entity158 and he has taken a big leap since @entity160 sent him to work with former @entity162 professional @entity161 last october			1
" when we initially set my goals at the beginning of the year we set a top - 50 goal by the end of the summer , so a lot of things came a lot quicker than planned , " said @entity6 , now ranked 25th and likely to be seeded at the @entity98			1
" i worked on a lot of things in the offseason which helped me a lot			0
@entity175 was the biggest change , i was able to control a lot more of the situations			0
i was able to stay humble and calm and kept my head level with everything that was happening			0
" i was n't the superstar in the juniors , for me it just came recently			0
people talked a lot about potential with me , there were some believers but not too many believers			0
the way this came i surprised everybody and i surprised myself			0
" the goal now is i want to keep developing and progressing , make sure i 'm playing better this month than i was last month , and if i can do that the ranking will go up on its own			0
" while @entity15 - born @entity195 reached the heights of world no. 4 after gaining @entity199 citizenship in 1995 , @entity6 said he would remain loyal to his adopted country , having moved to @entity84 from @entity5 at the age of three			1
" they have been very supportive			0
i grew up through the last three years with their national center and they are thriving , and i think there 's a lot i can give there from a development and growth of the sport , " he said			0
" we have many great athletes but tennis is not the main thing they look up to -- they look up to hockey			2
i hope i can keep doing well and help the sport grow so we can have a few more players at the top			2
