three @entity2 women political activists were found dead with gunshots to the head early thursday , police in @entity6 said , in an unexplained act of violence that has shocked the @entity2 community			1
@entity11 's @entity10 explains what the impact of the killings is likely to be , and how the conflict between @entity2 nationalists and @entity17 affects the rest of the world			1
q ) what are the possible consequences of the killings ? a ) a spokesman for the leadership of the @entity24 and its affiliate the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 has confirmed to @entity11 that one of the women killed , @entity28 , was one of the founding members of the @entity24			1
he called the murders an " ideological and political assassination , a terror attack against the @entity2 people			0
" these murders have clearly dropped a bombshell on the tightly - knit @entity2 community in @entity37 and probably throughout the substantial @entity2 diaspora in @entity39			2
we can certainly expect protests and memorial demonstrations in @entity39			1
and the murders in @entity6 are already having ripple effects all the way over here in @entity17 , where the @entity47 make up the country 's largest [ and historically oppressed ] ethnic minority			1
@entity2 leaders in @entity17 are calling for @entity47 to " rise in protest wherever they are to condemn this massacre			1
" a huge concern is what impact the killings might have on a new historic round of talks between the @entity17 government and the jailed @entity24 leader @entity60 , as well as other figures in the @entity2 movement			1
many @entity17 commentators fear it may derail these negotiations			0
@entity66 , author of " @entity67 : the @entity24 and the @entity2 fight for @entity73 , " an inluential book on the @entity24 , wrote to me in an email , saying : " one thing is for sure , this is n't good for the rumored peace process			2
" q ) is it possible to speculate about who might have done it , and why now ? a ) there is much speculation already about who might have carried out these murders			0
@entity2 groups and @entity17 commentators are already interpreting this as a politically - motivated act of violence , even though it will certainly take some time for investigators to conclude who carried out the shootings			2
there are extremists on both sides of the @entity17 - @entity2 conflict who may seek to derail the negotiation process that has been under way for more than a month between the @entity17 government and @entity60 , as well as other figures in the @entity2 movement			2
@entity100 , the spokesman for @entity17 's ruling @entity101 , already told journalists that " when you look at how it was carried out , it seems like an internal settling of scores within the @entity24			1
" certainly , the @entity24 has a history of killing dissidents within the @entity2 movement , says @entity110 , senior @entity17 analyst for the @entity111			1
he told me : " you do have to remember that the @entity24 has a long history of killing its own people			0
" meanwhile , the @entity17 state has long relied on military force , arrests and law suits to crush the @entity2 movement inside @entity17			2
the @entity17 - @entity24 war is one of the longest - running conflicts in the @entity122 , with more than 40,000 people killed since the 1980s			0
many @entity47 view the @entity17 government and armed forces as mortal enemies , while many @entity17 label the @entity24 and anyone affiliated with the @entity24 as " terrorists			1
" so certainly i can expect some @entity47 will accuse @entity17 of assassinating these three women , even if there is no evidence to back up that claim			1
q ) who are the @entity24 and what are they fighting for ? a ) the @entity24 , or @entity24 , was founded in 1978 in @entity17 as a @entity137 , @entity136 nationalist movement			0
in 1984 , it started armed combat against the @entity17 state with the goal of establishing a broader @entity2 in the @entity122 , which would unite @entity2 minorities divided between @entity17 , @entity141 , @entity26 and @entity142			0
that goal has been largely dropped over the last decade -- certainly since @entity17 authorities arrested @entity60 in 1999			0
now the @entity24 appears to have much more limited goals : battling for @entity2 " cultural freedoms " in @entity17 as well as some degree of autonomy for the @entity47 , who are predominantly settled in south - eastern @entity17			1
there are @entity24 fighters battling @entity17 security forces in the hills of south - eastern @entity17 , as well as camps and training bases strung out along remote mountains in northern @entity26 , along the border with @entity17			0
the @entity24 enjoys substantial support and reportedly relies on fund - raising from within the @entity2 diaspora in @entity39			1
finally , given the @entity162 demonstrations i 've covered , there is support for the @entity24 in @entity165 , which is not only @entity17 's most populous city , but also the largest @entity2 city in the world			1
why ? because hundreds of thousands of @entity47 fled the war and punitive @entity17 military operations in south - eastern @entity17 in the 1990s and were forced to resettle in western @entity17 cities			0
the @entity24 has been officially labeled a terrorist organization by @entity17 , as well as the @entity173 and many european countries			0
q ) how many expat @entity47 live in @entity39 cities ? where are most based ? a ) @entity39 is home to a substantial @entity2 diaspora , with large communities in @entity37 , @entity179 , @entity180 , the @entity181 and @entity182			1
according to a report from the @entity111 , there are 1 to 1.5 million @entity47 originating from @entity17 living in @entity39 ; the bulk of them , with an estimated population of 800,000 , are in @entity180			1
the @entity162 television station @entity187 , is believed to broadcast from @entity39			0
@entity191 ) how do the killings , possible consequences , and the guerrilla war that the @entity24 has fought for nearly three decades against @entity17 affect the rest of the world ? a ) the @entity17 - @entity24 conflict is one of the longest - running conflicts in the @entity122			0
it is a conflict that constantly bleeds across borders , destabilizing relations between @entity17 , @entity141 , @entity26 and @entity142			0
it also ripples throughout @entity39 , with the @entity17 government constantly accusing @entity39 countries of not doing enough to stop @entity24 fund - raising and recruitment in @entity39 cities			1
at the height of the @entity17 - @entity24 war , @entity24 activists were reported to shut down highways in @entity180			2
i personally recall first encountering the @entity24 when i worked in @entity210 in 1999 , when the @entity11 bureau received a terrifying video of several @entity24 supporters setting themselves on fire in @entity210 to protest the arrest of @entity60			0
in recent months , the conflict has reached the deadliest levels in at least 13 years , with hundreds of @entity17 soldiers and security forces as well as @entity2 rebel fighters killed over the last year			0
q ) have n't the talks between @entity17 and the @entity47 been making progress recently ? a ) there is surprising support for the talks not only from the @entity17 government , but also from opposition political parties as well as from influential voices in the @entity17 media			2
i get the sense that @entity17 society is exhausted by the weekly and daily deaths of conscript soldiers			0
@entity17 will have to make substantial , long overdue compromises if it is ever to make peace with its @entity47 , such as removing discriminatory statements in the constitution and allowing @entity2 language education in schools			2
there have been other , largely covert attempts at negotiations over the last 4 years , but they have been accompanied by a parallel increase in violence and killing in the blood - soaked hills of south - eastern @entity17 .			0

the murder of three @entity2 women political activists remains a *mystery*
a spokesman for @entity24 and @entity25 told @entity11 the attacks were assassinations
" expect protests and memorial demonstrations in @entity39 " , says @entity10
in @entity17 , @entity47 are the largest and oppressed ethnic minority , says @entity10
