be it a @entity1 submarine or be it not , whatever has been lurking beneath the waves of the @entity6 archipelago since last week is not only drawing threats of martial force from @entity10 's military , it 's also getting on @entity13 's nerves			1
he putters around the archipelago with tourists in a small decommissioned military sub originally designed as a target for naval battle exercises			1
and now some of his countrymen are gunning for him			2
they think his submersible is what the navy detected as a potential intruder into its sovereign waters on thursday			2
the military has been trawling the @entity29 waters ever since			1
the news has his business ' phone ringing , with more people booking tours			0
but most of the calls are annoying , he says			0
" many people believe we caused this military operation , " @entity13 said , " and they call to demand that we pay the bill for it			1
" @entity44 @entity13 has continued the tours despite the underwater drama , informing the navy closely about his moves , and cutting a wide berth around the battleships , minesweepers and helicopters looking for a suspicious something			1
the government wo n't say what that something is , but @entity10 's press is reporting the military is looking for a submarine , maybe a @entity1 one			1
@entity10 intelligence picked up a radio distress call last week -- in @entity1 -- which set off the defensive reconnaissance , major daily newspaper @entity60 reported			1
the transmissions were directed at the @entity1 enclave of @entity67 , 330 miles ( 530 kilometers ) south of @entity6 , on the @entity29 's southern shore , @entity64 reported			1
@entity70 the search has reignited @entity73 intrigue reminiscent of the blockbuster movie " @entity75			0
" a @entity10 military spokeswoman warned tuesday that they " are prepared to use anything necessary to bring the vessel to the surface if we need to			1
" the same day the military called underwater tour operator @entity13			2
" they ... told us to cancel the trip because of security reasons , " he said			0
" i assumed something had happened			0
" there were reports in the press that ships hovered for an extended period over one spot			0

the @entity98 said it was n't , according to an @entity102 report			2
vulnerability confirmation may be hard to come by , former @entity105 commander @entity104 wrote in an analysis for @entity108			0
subs are hard to find , especially in a rocky archipelago			0
" the rocky floor of an inland sea like the @entity29 can mask acoustic signatures , " he said			0
that blunts the ability of searchers in the air and on sea to identify an underwater object			0
also , the @entity121 and @entity122 , like many @entity124 militaries , have cut back on funding for submarine defenses since the end of the @entity73 , @entity104 says			2
" anti-submarine warfare was something they would have needed against the @entity131 during the @entity73 but less so during @entity133 crisis days with @entity1 , " he says			1
despite the increase in tourist interest in the undersea wonders near @entity6 , nothing has turned up during @entity13 's forays			2
