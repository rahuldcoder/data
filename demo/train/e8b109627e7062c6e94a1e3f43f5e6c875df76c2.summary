-- @entity1 has already won the 2013 formula one world championship -- at least that 's the view of his @entity5 rivals , despite there being six races left this season			1
@entity9 driver @entity1 took the checkered flag at sunday 's @entity11 to win his seventh race of the year and extend his lead over @entity5 's @entity14 in the drivers ' standings to 60 points			1
despite an encouraging race which saw @entity14 finish in second place after starting seventh on the grid , team principal @entity18 declared that @entity5 will be prioritizing 2014 between now and the end of the current season			1
" now it 's clear that 99 % of our energies will be concentrated on the 2014 project , " @entity18 told @entity5 's official website			1
" ahead of the summer break we were striving hard for a performance gain in @entity33 , on a track with characteristics that are particularly unsuitable for our car			0
" instead we lost even more ground , despite the fact that the @entity39 has improved in certain ways , otherwise @entity14 would never have managed to do what he did in the second part of the race in terms of tire management			2
blog : does @entity47 lack compelling characters ? " we still have some new parts for the car that we will bring to the coming races but , above all , we will now try to make the most out of what we already have			0
" two - time world champion @entity14 last week pledged his loyalty to @entity5 amid reported interest from former team @entity55 , and on saturday said he wants to extend his contract			1
next season @entity14 will be partnered by @entity57 , the current @entity58 driver who was the last man to win the drivers ' championship for @entity5 in 2007			1
@entity14 hopes a raft of new technical regulations which will be introduced to the sport next season will benefit @entity5			2
" we started ( the season ) in a good way , " the 32 - year - old , who is without a grand prix win since may , told the @entity70			2
" we were competitive in @entity71 , maybe not in qualifying but in the race we were taking care of the tires very , very well , together with @entity58			0
" we won in @entity76 , we won in @entity77 and then we seemed to lose a little bit of performance , especially when the 2012 tires came back			0
" for next year , we start from zero			0
really we will put all our effort and hopes into 2014 , because starting from zero is our best opportunity to close the gap with all the top teams			0

@entity5 will prioritize 2014 campaign for the rest of this season
@entity5 's @entity14 trails @entity1 by 60 points in the drivers ' standings
@entity1 's win at the @entity11 was his seventh of 2013
the @entity9 driver is *bidding* for a *fourth* *consecutive* world championship
