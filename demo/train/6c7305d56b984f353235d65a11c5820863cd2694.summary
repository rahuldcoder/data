-- this has been a banner year for crime novelist @entity2			1
a film adaptation of " @entity4 " was a critical success and could become a tv series next year			0
his most recent novel , " @entity7 , " hit no. 1 on the bestseller list , and @entity2 topped 1 million e-books sold online			1
his latest novel , " @entity13 , " arrives in bookstores tuesday and is poised to be another top seller			1
this is @entity2 's 24th novel and the 18th featuring his dogged @entity18 detective @entity17			1
" @entity13 " finds @entity19 fighting off forced retirement , struggling to be a better single father to his teenage daughter and pursuing two mysteries simultaneously			1
in one , @entity19 is called to the famous @entity25 hotel to investigate the death of an @entity29 city councilman 's son			1
did the victim jump , or was he pushed from a hotel window ? it 's a case fraught with " high jingo , " police speak for internal politics			1
the second mystery comes from the @entity18 's " open - unsolved unit			1
" in a cold case dating to 1989 , @entity19 makes a chilling discovery : a serial killer has been operating in @entity29 in secret for decades			0
unlike @entity19 , there 's no talk of retirement with @entity2			1
with 42 million copies of his books sold worldwide , he 's just back from a promotional tour in @entity48			2
he 's pressing ahead with plans to bring @entity17 to the big screen , looking for the right deal and the right people to work with , and working on a tv pilot for " @entity4			1
" he 's also preparing to celebrate 20 years as a novelist			1
@entity0 recently caught up with @entity2 to talk about his new book			1
the following is an edited transcript			0
@entity0 : what was the spark behind your latest book ? @entity2 : actually , there were a couple different sparks			1
the book has two parallel stories going through it			0
one i call the political story			0
in a turnabout , @entity17 ends up more or less working for a guy who 's been his nemesis in other books			1
that was an idea suggested to me by a cop a long time ago , and i 've been holding on to it , carrying it around with me , waiting for the right time to write that story			0
the other story is @entity17 on a cold case , inspired by an aspect of @entity29 's " @entity90 " case -- not necessarily the investigation of the alleged serial killer but the fact that when they caught the guy they say is the @entity90 , they found thousands of photos and videotapes in his possession of women , many of them potential victims			1
a squad of detectives has to go to work looking through all these photos every day trying to identify the people , trying to find identifiable characteristics in the pictures			0
it just seemed like a very difficult task knowing that all these people could have ended up being victims of a pretty bad predator			0
just that idea kind of shot through and gave me images , and i knew that was the other prong of the story , that @entity17 encounters something like that			1
@entity0 : @entity19 is dealing with some pretty dark subject matter in this novel			0
was that planned ? @entity2 : you know , i do n't really outline my books , so i ca n't say i knew what was going to happen			1
i was impressed by this real case , and i wanted to create a case that had that aspect			0
after i was done writing " the drop , " i looked back at that chapter , and i thought that might be the darkest chapter i 've ever written			0
who would have seen that coming 10 months ago , when i started writing the book ? @entity0 : how has @entity17 changed over the course of your career ? @entity2 : i think he 's changed a lot			1
the books take place in real time , so it 's more than 18 years of @entity17			1
like anybody who 's aged 18 years , you 're going to be different			1
a lot of his hard edges have worn down by his experiences			0
i think his cynicism has been alleviated somewhat by having his daughter in his life in the last couple of books			0
that 's become a very big part of his focus in life			2
he 'd been a father for a long time , but he 'd never been engaged in raising her until she was a teenager			0
he 's not that good at it			2
he 's learning as he goes , but what 's affecting him is what affects anyone who becomes a parent : you hope for a better world for your children , so that 's kind of changed his outlook on the world			2
@entity0 : like @entity17 , you too are a father			1
how does that impact your novels ? @entity2 : @entity17 does n't have the benefit that you and i have of being with our kids from the beginning			1
@entity17 's daughter is a year older than mine , so they share a lot of stuff			1
sometimes his daughter says stuff that my daughter says , and so forth			0
but @entity17 's learning curve is much different from mine			1
he makes a lot of missteps , and he does a lot of things that might seem odd to other parents , but when you look at his perspective of where he 's been in his life , the institutions he 's been a part of , they seem quite natural			2
he takes his daughter shooting			0
i do n't know too many people that would do that			0
i 'm not going to make a judgment on whether it 's right or wrong ; it 's just not the usual type of father - daughter outing			2
that in a way is an endearing part of their relationship			0
he wants to pass on some of his skills to her , and he 's working on that , and i think you can see that in this book			2
@entity0 : your books always incorporate real @entity29 landmarks ; do you have any favorite spots you 've written about ? @entity2 : the @entity25 is one of my favorites			1
i do n't live in @entity29 anymore , but i 'm there a lot , and i stay in various hotels , but i stay there often , in room 79 , which is a crime scene in this book			0
i 've stayed there many times			0
i really like that place			0
it 's got some celebrity cachet , but it 's also got this old - world charm			2
it 's a very private place that i really like , so that was kind of fun to write			2
some of this book was written in that room			0
that 's always fun when you can do something like that			2
they knew i was writing the book			0
they 're very nice to me there , and they just said " treat us with respect			0
" i do have a crime scene set there , but hopefully my love of the place , its attractiveness , comes out in the book			0
@entity0 : you 're just back from a book tour in the @entity256			0
what was that like ? @entity2 : the book 's just coming out here in the @entity260 , but it came out in october in @entity48			1
so i was over there promoting the book , and it 's not even out here , so it 's a little bit unusual			2
it was fun , good reception , good weather when i was in the @entity256 and @entity268 , a fun thing to do			0
i did a number of events			0
they were well - attended , and i just heard a couple of days ago the book is no. 1 in @entity268			0
i 'm of @entity276 descent , so that 's always good to hear			2
@entity0 : you recently became part of a very exclusive club ; your ebooks have sold more than 1 million copies online			0
how does that feel ? @entity2 : that was actually shocking when i heard that and the company of authors i 'm included with now			1
i think " @entity4 " movie had something to do with it ; it 's a pretty good movie , and i think that inspired a lot of people to check out the book			2
that probably pushed me over the top			0
@entity0 : do you have a favorite book this year ? @entity2 : two books i read recently , " @entity299 " by @entity300 and " @entity301 " by @entity302 , were really outstanding			1
also a new book i just read			0
it 's called " @entity306 " by @entity305			2
it 's set in @entity29 , kind of a noir story			2
his father was a famous screenwriter			0
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? @entity2 : well , you 've always got to keep writing , so i 'm writing			1
next year is kind of a significant year for me			0
it will be 20 years since my first book came out , so next year , i 'll publish my 25th book			1
i 've thought a lot about that and just felt like it should be @entity17			1
so i 'm working on a @entity17 book			1
it 's called " @entity321			2
" that 's under way , and hopefully it will be out around this time next year			2
read an excerpt from " @entity13			1
