@entity0 -- @entity0 art collector @entity2 and his father share a love for @entity6 art. the younger @entity2 buys modern @entity6 art ; his dad owns an important collection of traditional @entity6 ink drawings			1
in the past , they 've sold some of their pieces at auction without much drama			2
however , there was one particularly frustrating transaction			0
" my dad encountered an experience where he sold a piece of work upwards of $ 5 million to $ 10 million			0
it took the buyer almost half a year to pay the auction house , " @entity2 recalls , saying the anonymous buyer was most likely from mainland @entity6			1
whether it 's a cultural issue or a calculated financial move , non-payment causes major headaches for all players involved			2
the sellers do n't get their money , the auction house does n't get its commission , and storage and insurance costs add up			2
" with big - ticket items , it 's becoming more and more of a concern with mainland buyers			1
to a certain extent , they have less of a tendency to follow the rules of the game , " @entity2 says			0
" sometimes , it 's not so much about the money			2
they just ca n't be bothered			0
their attitude is , ' i 'm such a big customer			0
i ca n't be bothered			0
maybe i 'll pay a third now and then another third later '			2
" the rise in deadbeat art buyers in the region comes in tandem with @entity58 's growing importance in the global art market			1
" up until 2008 , @entity58 was 2 % to 4 % of group sales , " says @entity60 , president of @entity61			1
" today , 25 % of our buyers come from this region			1
" " @entity69 buyers not paying seems to be a phenomenon that 's increasingly prevalent , " says fine art consultant @entity66 , based in @entity0			1
" they always have the money but they do n't necessarily want to spend it			0
yet , they still want the art. they want the best of both worlds			0
" @entity66 's worst experience was overseeing a transaction in which the buyer took two years to pay up			1
@entity83 's has been bitten hard in the past and now takes a very aggressive stance against deadbeat auction winners			1
@entity83 's @entity58 has filed 13 lawsuits since 2007 with five cases still unresolved			1
" our lawsuits do not mean that we are experiencing more defaults than other auction houses			1
it just means that we take our obligations to our consignors seriously and are willing to take this step when necessary to protect them , " @entity92 , ceo of @entity83 's @entity58 , wrote in an email to @entity1			1
@entity83 's recently sued two mainland buyers , @entity99 and @entity100 , because they had n't paid for winning bids that totaled $ 15 million			1
@entity83 's confirms @entity100 has since settled her payment while the case against @entity99 is still winding its way through @entity0 's @entity106			1
while mainland buyers get most of the bad rap , industry insiders say the problem also exists among buyers from other emerging markets like @entity113 and @entity114			2
@entity115 's @entity58 says the problem is not a major issue for the auction house today but it was a problem back in 2010			1
" i always wondered why someone would come to an auction , raise their hand and bid , and decide not to pay afterward , " says @entity60			2
" i thought it was something new for some customers -- like going to a gallery , deciding to buy and the next day changing their mind			0
i suppose it was because some collectors were new to the auction game and were not familiar with it			0
" as a safeguard , major auction houses often require significant deposits before the bidding takes place			0
last october , @entity83 's introduced an across - the - board deposit policy in which prospective bidders must put down a minimum deposit of hk $ 200,000 ( us $ 25,800 )			1
at @entity61 " we ask you to pay a 20 % deposit on what we think you 're going to buy ... if you win the bid , that 20 % goes toward the sale , " says @entity60			1
" if not , we return the money to you the day after the auction			0
" before an auction , both @entity83 's and @entity115 's ask for bank references from bidders or talk to major dealers to find out if the bidder has a good track record			1
still , buyer and seller beware			0
" the risk is inherent			0
art is generally not the most liquid of assets			0
it 's probably one of the most illiquid in terms of worth			0
so people trying to put off payment is just part of that , " cautions @entity66			0
@entity2 explains why the risk may be worth taking at auction , compared to buying art through a gallery or middleman			2
" chances are you are still getting the best price at auction , " he says			0
" the risk is higher and there 's more concern about getting payment , but it 's the risk the seller has to take			2

as art sales in @entity6 grow , so are the *difficulties* receiving payment for auction buys
rise in art sales defaults comes in tandem with @entity58 's growing impact on the global art market
@entity83 's recently introduced a policy where all bidders must pay a minimum deposit
" up until 2008 , @entity58 was 2 - 4 % of group sales . today , 25 % of our buyers come from ( @entity58 ) "
