just hours after delivery , a baby born with @entity1 in @entity2 was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs			1
two and half years later , doctors say the little girl still has no evidence of the life - threatening disease in her blood , despite being taken off medication			1
it 's a potential game changer in the fight against the virus that causes @entity16 , and it happened almost by accident			2
the unidentified girl was born to a mother who received no prenatal care and was not diagnosed as @entity1 positive herself until just before delivery , according to a case report published this week in the @entity23			1
researchers : toddler cured of @entity1 " we did n't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able do to prevent transmission to the baby , " said dr. @entity26 , a pediatric @entity1 specialist at the @entity27			1
doctors administered the antiretroviral drugs 30 hours after the girl was born in hopes of controlling the virus			1
within a couple of days , @entity26 confirmed the child was @entity1 positive			1
she said the baby had probably been infected in the womb			0
the child remained on antiretroviral drugs for approximately 15 months			2
her mother then stopped administering the drug for some reason , @entity26 said			0
the child has not received any antiretroviral drugs since that time , according to the report			2
in march , researchers announced that the girl was the first child to be " functionally cured " of @entity1			1
a " functional cure " is when the presence of the virus is so small , lifelong treatment is not necessary and standard clinical tests can not detect the virus in the blood			0
timeline : @entity16 moments to remember @entity26 told @entity63 the timing of intervention -- before the baby 's hiv diagnosis -- may deserve " more emphasis than the particular drugs or number of drugs used			1
" " we are hoping that future studies will show that very early institution of effective therapy will result in this same outcome consistently , " she said			0
high - risk exposure in march , dr. @entity78 , an immunologist at the @entity79 who worked closely with @entity26 , called the developments fascinating , including the fact that the toddler was found to have no virus in her blood even after her mother stopped giving her treatment			2
" this is the very first case in which we 've conclusively been able to document that the baby was infected and then after a period of treatment has been able to go off treatment without viral rebound , " @entity78 told @entity63			0
read more : why youths are n't getting tested for hiv researchers have long known that treating hiv - positive mothers early on is important , because they pass antibodies on to their babies			1
" one hundred percent of ( hiv - positive ) moms will pass those antibodies , but in the absence of treatment , only 30 % of moms will transmit the actual virus , " @entity78 told @entity63			1
@entity1 - positive mothers given appropriate treatment pass on the virus in less than 2 % of cases , @entity78 said			1
" so all babies are born antibody positive , but only a fraction of babies born to hiv - positive women will actually get the virus , and that fraction depends on whether the mom and baby are getting antiviral prophylaxis ( preventative treatment ) or not , " @entity78 said			1
newborns are considered high - risk if their mothers ' hiv infections are not under control or if they are found to be @entity1 positive when they 're close to delivering			1
@entity1 - free for now after transplant moving quickly to suppress the virus usually , these infants would get antiviral drugs at preventative doses for six weeks to prevent infection , then start therapy if @entity1 is diagnosed			1
investigators said the @entity2 case may change that practice because it highlights the potential for cure with early standard antiretroviral therapy , or art. @entity139 is a combination of at least three drugs used to suppress the virus and stop the progression of the disease			2
but they do not kill the virus			0
tests showed the virus in the @entity2 baby 's blood continued to decrease and reached undetectable levels within 29 days of the initial treatment			0
dr. @entity153 , a virologist with @entity154 , was lead author on an early report about this case that was presented at a conference			0
the early treatment likely led to the infant 's cure , she said			0
' like pulling teeth ' to get doctors to test for @entity1 " prompt antiviral therapy in newborns that begins within days of exposure may help infants clear the virus and achieve long - term remission without lifelong treatment by preventing such viral hideouts from forming in the first place , " @entity153 said			1
@entity153 and @entity172 are part of a group of researchers working to explore and document possible pediatric @entity1 cure cases			1
the group was funded by a grant from @entity179 , and the @entity180			0
dr. @entity181 , @entity179 vice president and director of research , said it is " imperative that we learn more about a newborn 's immune system , how it differs from an adult 's and what factors made it possible for the child to be cured			2
" dr. @entity192 , director of the @entity193 at the @entity180 , said in march that he was enthusiastic about the findings			0
" the best way to either eliminate the virus or allow the immune system to suppress residual virus is to treat someone as early as possible after infection so as not to allow a substantial reservoir of the virus to take hold , " @entity192 told @entity63			0
" at the same time , you prevent the immune system from being severely damaged by the continual replication of ( the ) virus for an extended period of time , " he said			0
" the situation with a child born of an infected mother where most of the infections are transmitted to the newborn at or around the time of delivery provides an excellent opportunity to cure an infected baby , and this approach deserves further study			2
" @entity1 may be ' functionally cured ' in some ' @entity222 patient ' researchers say the only other documented case of an @entity1 cure is that of @entity226 , known as the " @entity222 patient			1
" in 2007 , @entity226 , an @entity1 - positive @entity228 living in @entity229 , was battling both leukemia and @entity1 when he underwent a bone marrow transplant that cured not only his cancer but his @entity1			1
in an interview last year , @entity226 told dr. @entity234 , @entity63 's chief medical correspondent , he was still @entity1 - free			1
" i 've been tested everywhere possible , " said @entity226 , who now lives in @entity235			0
" my blood 's been tested by many , many agencies			0
i 've had two colonoscopies to test to see if they could find @entity1 in my colon , and they have n't been able to find any			2
" but @entity226 's case is rare			0
and the procedure , which is extremely dangerous , wo n't work in most patients because the bone marrow he received had a special genetic mutation that made the stem cells in it naturally resistant to the virus			0
researchers tell @entity63 only 1 % of @entity250 -- mostly @entity252 @entity251 -- and no african - americans or @entity254 have this particular mutation			2
in june , five years after he was " cured , " reports surfaced that " traces " of the virus had been found in @entity226 's blood			2
even then , some @entity1 experts said that does n't matter , that he 's been cured			1
in fact , many @entity16 experts said they believe @entity226 has experienced what 's called a " sterilizing " cure , meaning the virus has been eliminated from the body entirely			0
routine clinical testing on the @entity2 toddler continues			0
" we have formed a hypothesis , " @entity78 said , " and that is already driving the design of new studies and clinical trials that will help us to answer the question of whether by coming in very early we will be able to treat children for a while and then remove them from therapy			0
" get the latest news from @entity282			0

doctors say girl who was born @entity1 positive is @entity1 - free after 2 *1/2* years
they treated her with drugs before diagnosis was confirmed
she is considered to be " functionally cured " of @entity1 , researchers say
researchers hope to one day *improve* outcomes for other *people*
