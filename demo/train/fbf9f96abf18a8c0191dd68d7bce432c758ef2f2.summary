today , the ebola virus spreads only through direct contact with bodily fluids , such as blood and vomit			2
but some of the nation 's top infectious disease experts worry that this deadly virus could mutate and be transmitted just by a cough or a sneeze			1
" it 's the single greatest concern i 've ever had in my 40 - year public health career , " said dr. @entity11 , director of the @entity12 at the @entity13			0
" i ca n't imagine anything in my career -- and this includes hiv -- that would be more devastating to the world than a respiratory transmissible ebola virus			2
" the @entity22 says its scientists are unaware of any virus that has dramatically changed its mode of transmission			2
" for example , the @entity28 avian influenza virus ... has probably circulated through many billions of birds for at least two decades			2
its mode of transmission remains basically unchanged			0
speculation that ebola virus disease might mutate into a form that could easily spread among humans through the air is just that : speculation , unsubstantiated by any evidence			1
" @entity11 and other experts could n't think of another virus that has made the transition from non-airborne to airborne in humans			1
they say the chances are relatively small that @entity48 will make that jump			1
but as the virus spreads , they warned , the likelihood increases			0
every time a new person gets @entity48 , the virus gets another chance to mutate and develop new capabilities			1
@entity11 calls it " genetic roulette			0
" as of october 1 , there have been more than 7,100 cases of @entity48 , with 3,330 deaths , according to the @entity22 , which has said the virus is spreading at a much faster rate than it was earlier in the outbreak			1
@entity48 is an rna virus , which means every time it copies itself , it makes one or two mutations			1
many of those mutations mean nothing , but some of them might be able to change the way the virus behaves inside the human body			1
" imagine every time you copy an essay , you change a word or two			1
eventually , it 's going to change the meaning of the essay , " said dr. @entity78 , one of the heroes featured in " @entity80			1
" the roots of our @entity48 fears that book chronicles the 1989 outbreak of @entity89 , which was transmitted among monkeys by breathing			1
in 2012 , @entity92 researchers found that @entity93 , which is involved in the current outbreak , was passed from pigs to monkeys in the air			0
dr. @entity98 , the director of the @entity99 at the @entity100 , said the problem is that no one is keeping track of the mutations happening across @entity105 , so no one really knows what the virus has become			2
one group of researchers looked at how @entity48 changed over a short period of time in just one area in @entity113 early on in the outbreak , before it was spreading as fast as it is now			1
they found more than 300 genetic changes in the virus			0
" it 's frightening to look at how much this virus mutated within just three weeks , " said dr. @entity118 , an associate professor at @entity119 and senior associate member of the @entity121 , where the research was done			0
even without becoming airborne , the virus has overwhelmed efforts to stop it			0
funerals , ghost towns and haunted health workers @entity11 commended groups like @entity132 but said uncoordinated efforts by individual organizations are no match for @entity48 spreading swiftly through urban areas			2
" this is largely dysfunctional			0
nobody 's in command , and nobody 's in charge , " he said			0
" it 's like not having air traffic control at an airport			0
the planes would just crash into each other			0

experts fear that @entity48 will mutate and become *spreadable* via cough or sneeze
@entity48 is an rna virus , meaning every time it copies itself , it mutates
most mutations mean nothing , but some could change the way the virus behaves
