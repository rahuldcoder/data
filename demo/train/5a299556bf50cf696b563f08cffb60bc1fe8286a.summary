@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's a competition that brings out some of the toughest , hardiest , most ferociously determined athletes in the world			2
in fact , most of the competitors in this sport are n't even human			0
it 's a race boasting more mileage and fur coats than perhaps any other on the planet -- worn by both participants and spectators bundled from head to toe to face a punishing 2012 @entity1 winter			2
dubbed the " @entity23 " by organizers , the @entity21 sled dog trail in @entity1 is legendary			2
the race is currently celebrating its 40th running , now under way on the trail between @entity0 and @entity28			1
this year , @entity21 spectators had to brave near - record snowfall in @entity0 just to get a glimpse of their favorite teams -- howling at top of their lungs in anxious anticipation of their turn at the starting point			2
the nearly 1,000 - mile race covers some of the most extreme terrain on @entity41 , each team powered by 64 booted paws and a musher 's dogged desire to be the first to reach the finish line on the @entity47			1
the @entity21 has been an annual @entity1 sporting event since 1973 , drawing spectators and competitors from across the world			0
each year , hundreds of spectators travel to @entity1 hoping for some personal interaction with the mushers and their four - legged teammates			2
there are many opportunities for visitors to meet their favorite mushers along the trail , but it takes some advance planning to get the most out of an @entity21 vacation			0
the 2012 trail covers approximately 945 miles , so spectators must first determine which portion of the race they aim to see			0
the ceremonial start of the race is , by far , the most popular choice of fans seeking access and convenience			1
there are a number of events in and around @entity0 leading up to the @entity21 start , such as the @entity77 , various @entity21 educational seminars featuring mushers and race officials , and even a competing annual festival and parade in @entity0 , the @entity83			2
on the first saturday of march , thousands of @entity21 enthusiasts line @entity0 's historic @entity85 to participate in the celebratory send - off			0
race officials personally introduce each team as they depart " the chute , " announcers struggling to be heard over a cacophony of howling dog teams			0
mushers and their dogs often don festive regalia at the noncompetitive ceremonial start while also toting warmly bundled " @entity98 " in their sleds			1
iditariders are fans who bid on a ceremonial sled ride as part of a program which helps to support the race financially			1
the chance at a ceremonial 11 - mile @entity21 sled ride begins at $ 500 and can cost as much as $ 7,500 for the opportunity to experience the event in a sled driven by a popular race champion			1
following a saturday ceremonial start , mushers quickly regroup their dog teams and reorganize trail necessities for the following day 's " official start " of the race in @entity116 , @entity1 , 79 miles north of @entity0			1
spectators who travel to @entity116 by car or shuttle bus can once again line " the chute " on sunday afternoon to cheer on mushers as the race clock officially begins			0
for most spectators , the next eight to 12 days involve closely monitoring the race online with the assistance of real - time gps tracking and video coverage from the trail checkpoints -- available on @entity130			0
behind the scenes at @entity21 however , for those seeking a more intensive race experience , travel operators offer various " flightseeing " and snowmobile excursions in order to catch mushers crossing through some of the more than 20 remote checkpoints			2
the price to travel across the diverse @entity1 landscape by bush plane can be expensive during the @entity21 , but the experience is almost always described as unforgettable			0
the @entity146 - era town of @entity28 is the end of the trail where the famous @entity21 " burled arch " forms the finish line			1
crowds of spectators line narrow , snow - packed @entity153 to greet the winner			0
last year 's @entity155 , @entity156 , made it to @entity28 with a record - setting pace -- 8 days , 18 hours and 46 minutes			1
a loud siren sounds day or night throughout @entity28 announcing the arrival of teams nearing the finish line			1
hotels in @entity28 , however , are scarce and must be booked months in advance for die - hard fans and visitors hoping to be present when the leaders arrive			1
for other spectators happy to simply get any glimpse of the remaining teams ' arrivals at the finish line , opportunities continue for approximately a week			0
while the @entity21 may be known as " @entity174 , " there 's no sign it 's coming to an end anytime soon			0
if you 're unable to witness this year 's race at points along the trail , 2013 promises to deliver yet another compelling @entity23 -- a truly @entity1 experience			1
@entity2 's @entity182 contributed to this story .			0

plan for next year 's race finish by booking rooms in @entity28 well in advance
fans can become " @entity98 " by bidding on sled rides during the ceremonial start
flightseeing in bush planes is another way to see the race in progress
