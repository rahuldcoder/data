-- @entity2 's president @entity1 will have plenty to discuss with his @entity5 host and counterpart @entity6 when they meet on the sidelines of the @entity10 leaders ' summit in @entity11 this week , as relations between the former foes grow cozier			1
the hot issue is clearly @entity15 , where @entity2 and @entity5 strongly oppose any @entity17 - led military intervention against president @entity19 's government in @entity20 over its apparent use of chemical weapons			1
both urge restraint and call for a political solution -- much to @entity27 's consternation			0
@entity1 , who calls the @entity2 - @entity5 relationship the " best " among major countries , says they will always be good neighbors who aspire to " never be enemies			1
" @entity2 is a major buyer of @entity5 weaponry and the two countries held their biggest joint naval exercise in the @entity35 in july this year			1
@entity36 - @entity6 will have chance to talk on ' margins ' of @entity10 summit the two countries also enjoy a growing trade relationship , expected to be worth $ 100 billion by 2015 , that is based heavily on @entity2 buying @entity5 energy exports such as oil and gas			1
as part of this energy trade , both sides see investment opportunities in @entity48 and @entity50 resources development , and in the related advancement of pipeline infrastructure and maritime transport links such as the @entity54 through @entity48 waters			0
@entity6 has made it clear that he wants to see this energy trade grow even more vigorously , and has given strong backing to the various oil and gas deals struck so far by @entity5 - state owned energy companies @entity62 and @entity63 with @entity64 ( @entity64 )			1
the @entity5 non-state company @entity65 also has a deal with @entity64 involving development of the vast @entity68 ( @entity70 ) project in northwest @entity71			0
@entity73 factor in contrast , relations between the @entity17 and @entity75 are increasingly frosty over issues such as missile defense , trade , human rights and the status of former @entity83 contractor @entity73 , who has taken refuge in @entity5 after releasing details of @entity17 surveillance programs			0
opinion : @entity73 asylum a blow to @entity17 - @entity5 relations more recently the crisis in @entity15 has heightened the rift between @entity27 and @entity75 , with @entity6 rejecting claims by @entity17 intelligence agencies that president @entity19 used chemical weapons against his own citizens			1
while @entity2 is @entity15 's biggest source of manufactured goods , it is @entity5 that supplies most of the military equipment used by the @entity15 armed forces and has been its most steadfast ally			1
@entity6 maintains that the @entity10 summit is a good forum to discuss @entity15			2
but earlier this month , @entity27 decided to cancel a planned @entity36 - @entity6 one - on - one meeting in @entity11 scheduled for this week			1
the two leaders last met at the @entity106 in @entity107 in june			0
@entity109 's first priority ? when @entity1 officially became @entity2 's president in march this year , his first overseas trip was to @entity5			1
during the visit , he described ties between @entity2 and @entity5 as among the most important in the world and said " it is also the best relationship between major countries			1
" according to @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity5 held " similar or identical positions on key international and regional issues			1
" for his part , @entity6 responded that @entity1 's visit would strengthen the strategic nature of their relationship			2
but things have n't always been so rosy in the post-war era			0
an ideological split between the two @entity130 powers in 1960 saw relations cool to the point where they fought a border war in 1969			0
ties were further strained by @entity2 's brief invasion of @entity5 ally @entity137 in 1979 -- though relations have warmed considerably since the breakup of the @entity140 and formation of the @entity5 in 1991			1
even today , with energy sales to @entity2 being such a key contributor to @entity5 's national budget , there is always the potential for friction			2
@entity148 has been one stumbling block , while the growing energy ambitions of the former @entity140 republics in @entity152 also come into calculations over pipeline routes			0
@entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 , for example , are already significant suppliers of @entity161 oil and gas to @entity2 via pipelines that connect to its far - western @entity165 province in the west			0
@entity5 oil from western @entity71 also flows through the @entity156 pipeline to @entity2			2
significantly , @entity1 will combine his trip to @entity5 for the @entity10 summit with state visits to @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity172 and @entity158 later this month			2
@entity36 's @entity152 ' pivot ' when it comes to @entity2 - @entity17 relations , @entity1 so far has shown an outgoing style in pursuing what he calls the great @entity2 dream of national renewal			1
@entity180 and @entity36 met as presidents for the first time at @entity184 estate in @entity185 in june this year			0
while the atmosphere was relaxed at their informal get - together , @entity1 clearly wanted the @entity17 - @entity2 dynamic to change			2
" we need to think creatively and act energetically , " he said , " so that working together we can build a new model of a major country relationship			0
" @entity1 wants the @entity17 to acknowledge @entity2 's emergence as a world power , not just in economic terms , but strategically as well			2
@entity1 's goal is to convince the @entity17 that the days of @entity17 strategic primacy in the @entity197 are coming to an end , and that @entity36 's military " pivot to @entity152 " looks to some in @entity200 as a policy of containment			0
@entity36 , who is likely to have a special meeting with @entity1 on the @entity10 sidelines later this week to continue their discussions on @entity208 , cyber-security , human rights , climate change and bilateral trade and investment , has already gone some way to accommodating @entity2 's ambitions , notwithstanding the @entity152 " pivot			2
" hosting @entity1 in @entity185 three months ago , @entity36 said it was inevitable that there were areas of tension between the two countries			0
" but what i 've learned over the last four years is both the @entity2 people and the @entity17 people want a strong , cooperative relationship , " @entity36 said			0
this week 's @entity10 is another opportunity to see how well the two sides can nurture that relationship , particularly when @entity15 looms as a major point of difference .			0
