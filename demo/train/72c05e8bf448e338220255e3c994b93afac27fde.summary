-- a massive iceberg that broke off an @entity4 glacier in july is now moving toward the open ocean and could pose a threat to busy shipping lanes , researchers reported			1
the huge berg is estimated to be about 270 square miles ( 700 square kilometers ) in area , about the size of nation of @entity12 or double the size of the city of @entity15			2
" an iceberg that size could survive for a year or longer and it could drift a long way north in that time and end up in the vicinity of world shipping lanes in the @entity25 , " @entity16 , a scientist at the @entity17 in @entity18 , said in a press release this week			2
detecting the dangers of @entity28 's giant icebergs @entity16 is part of a team of scientists who have been given an emergency grant to track the iceberg and predict its path so ships traveling through the area can be alerted			0
researchers at the @entity42 , using images from the @entity40 's @entity39 satellite , reported in july that the iceberg was separating from the @entity4 's @entity44			1
it had been kept close to the glacier by sea ice , another researcher , @entity49 from the @entity50 , told the @entity51			1
but the end of the @entity4 winter has melted some of the sea ice and given the berg a route to the open ocean , he said			1
" in the last couple of days , it has begun to break away and now a kilometer or two of clear water has developed between it and the glacier , " @entity49 told the @entity51			0
the calving of the massive berg has been a long process			0
the crack that produced it was first detected by a @entity67 plane in october 2011			0
the researchers say this will be the first time to track the path of such a massive iceberg , something that will be more important as the effects of global warming increase			0
@entity4 ice shelves ' tearing apart , ' says study			2

@entity80 could last in open ocean for a year , researcher says
sea ice that kept berg close to @entity4 now melting , scientist says
@entity80 separated from glacier in july
