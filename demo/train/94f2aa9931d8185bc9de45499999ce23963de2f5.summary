-- as the two @entity3 miners lay trapped in a space less than 5 feet square and 3,000 feet below the surface , they discovered common ground in @entity8 country singer @entity7			1
" i 'm more rock and roll , he 's more country , but we both knew ' @entity19 , ' by @entity7 , " @entity9 said of @entity10 , who spent 14 days trapped with @entity11 in the @entity13 gold mine in northern @entity14 in 2006			1
the two sang to pass the time , shared their life stories and told jokes after a 2.2 - magnitude earthquake triggered an underground rock fall , trapping them in darkness			1
they could not sit or stand			1
they were so cramped , one had to lie on his side if the other lay on his back			1
five days into their captivity , rescuers located them and established a phone line			1
the men were kept abreast of rescue efforts and were given counseling throughout the ordeal			1
rescuers also passed them food , water and ipods			1
but it would take another nine days for them to be extricated from the dank hole that @entity11 , at times , thought might become his grave			1
he never let the idea knock around his mind for too long , choosing to cling to hope that he would live to see his wife and two children			2
it 's the same advice he has for 33 @entity57 miners facing the prospect of remaining trapped 2,300 feet below ground for several months			2
" they 've got to keep their heads together and hope alive , " @entity11 said in a telephone interview from his home in @entity62 , @entity14			1
" they 've got air , they 've got food and water ; they 'll get them out of there eventually			2
" the miners have been trapped in the @entity76 copper and gold mine in northern @entity57 since its roof collapsed on august 5			1
rescuers took 17 days to locate them , during which the men rationed small amounts of tuna and mackerel to survive			2
rescuers were eventually able to send supplies through a 4 - inch pipe			1
on friday , the miners were informed that it could take another three to four months to get them out			2
the miners and their families will face stresses that could continue once the men are freed , experts and those who have survived similar ordeals say			2
@entity57 authorities have sought guidance from @entity99 and other institutions in the @entity8 on how to help the miners cope with their environment on physical , mental and logistical levels			2
the most common comparison in academia to their situation and others like it is space travel			2
astronauts and cosmonauts spend weeks or months in enclosed spaces cut off from society and loved ones , although to a lesser extent these days with the advancement of telecommunications			2
" there is a dialogue going on between @entity57 's @entity121 and @entity99 , where we have a great deal of experience regarding medical , nutritional and behavioral issues related to space travel , " @entity118 spokesman @entity117 said thursday			2
" [ we ] are providing that perspective to @entity57 , so that it can develop a program for helping to sustain these miners			2
" in addition to maintaining nutritional and hygienic needs , the men will need to develop a routine that resembles a normal life , down to mealtimes , showers and light to mimic daytime , said @entity140 , co-director of the @entity142 , and @entity143 at @entity144			1
" a large part of maintaining their mental well - being is allowing them to have a sense of control over the situation			1
that 's part of the reason why you want to develop a routine , " said @entity140 , who is also a member of the @entity152 in @entity153 , which has offered assistance to the @entity57 government through the @entity156			1
the @entity57 miners are already adopting various roles to help them through their ordeal and give structure to their existence			2
a shift leader is fulfilling a leadership role and another man with nursing experience is carrying out basic medical and psychological tests			2
maintenance mechanics helped organize the space			2
the men have split into two shifts so half can rest while the others keep busy doing tasks , exercising or playing card games or dominoes			2
stretchers that were stored in the rescue cabin are being used as beds			1
they hold daily meetings and make decisions by consensus , according to a video the men sent to the surface thursday			2
@entity140 , along with @entity11 and others who have shared the harrowing experience of being trapped in isolation , agreed that one asset the @entity57 miners have is space			2
portions of a 131 - foot - long ( 40 - meter ) shaft are being used as a latrine			1
the shaft is connected to the main 538 - square - foot ( 50 - square - meter ) cabin , which is being used for sleeping , washing and praying			1
" [ the space ] makes a significant difference , because it 's not so cramped that they ca n't stretch out			0
it sounds like they 'll have enough space to move around and potentially have some personal space and privacy , " @entity140 said			0
" the big downside is length of time , as far as how long it 'll take to get them out , " he said			0
" if they can maintain their psyche and develop a regular routine to stay psychologically fit , hopefully , they 'll make it			1
but this situation has no precedent			0
" like the @entity57 , who have asked for playing cards and religious figures to create a shrine , the @entity3 miners also received items to pass the time , including magazines , ipods , toothbrushes and clothes			1
when food first began to come , however , in the form of sweets , the rush of sugar overwhelmed their systems , making the situation even more unpleasant , @entity11 said			0
" that was definitely a low point , " @entity11 said , laughing			0
maintaining contact with people on the surface , especially loved ones , will help the @entity57 miners , he said			1
" that was a big stumbling block , thinking that if anything did happen i never coulda said , ' i love my wife , ' " @entity11 said			0
the @entity57 workers sent a video message to their families thursday in which they expressed thanks for the efforts under way to free them and assured them they were ok			0
nine coal miners trapped in southwestern @entity255 in 2002 wrote notes to their loved ones as water inched within 70 feet of where they sat huddled			1
the letters were sealed in a bucket to be found with their bodies , said @entity264 , whose son , @entity265 , was one of the men known now as the " @entity267 9			0
she has never seen her son 's letter , nor does she want to			0
" it was just so sad , such a sad time			0
i do n't want to hear the story again unless my son wants to tell me , " said @entity265 , a lifelong resident of @entity272 , @entity255			1
her father , husband and brothers have all spent time in the mines			0
for nearly five days in july 2002 , @entity265 awaited news at the @entity282 , surrounded by children , grandchildren and great - grandchildren , as well as the families of the eight other miners			1
together , they rode out the ups and downs of the rescue effort with support from the community			1
" it was crowded , food galore			0
they kept bringing the breakfasts , lunches , dinners , we did n't have to cook all weekend , " she said			0
" but we always came home to sleep because it was so crowded			0
not that we actually slept			0
" the first few days that her husband and son - in - law were trapped , @entity305 could not bring herself to sleep or eat			1
" i thought that if he 's not going to eat , i 'm not going to eat , " she said			0
" but i worried more for my daughter than for me because her husband was down there , too			0
she was really taking it hard			0
to have your father and husband in there , it was a lot worse for her because those were the two main men in her life			0
" most of the @entity267 9 declined to speak to @entity0 about the incident			0
but @entity324 said the key to their survival was simple : " stick together , keep warm and stay alive			1
" " we went through hell the first time , trying to escape			0
we were swimming through water up to our chins			0
we tried three different entries , but were n't nothing we could do			0
but when we heard them drilling we knew it was just gon na take time			0
we were n't about to give up			0
" words were scarce as the men sat in darkness more than 200 feet below ground , soaking wet and huddled together for body heat , @entity324 said			1
" was n't too many things to talk about ; about how long it 's gon na take , but we really did n't know			0
we just sat and waited and waited and waited , talked about how we 're never gon na go back in the mines , " he recalled			0
the first stage of preparing the @entity3 for their rescue began with injections of blood thinners they administered to themselves to prevent clots as a result of lying down for two weeks , @entity11 said			1
after the rescue , the real work of returning to society a new person began , not just for the survivors , but for their families			1
" your loved ones need to be ready for the emotional highs and lows			1
there 's this huge high when you get out , then life goes back to normal , and you go back down , " he said			0
@entity11 , now a part - time real estate agent , said he has watched only four movies since he 's been out			1
" the highs and lows are so extreme			1
when i 'm sad , i cry			0
when i 'm happy , i laugh a lot , probably too much			0
and your family needs to be ready to deal with all that			0
" @entity11 said he and @entity10 followed advice to do speaking engagements about their ordeal to exorcise their mind of the experience			0
that , along with three years of counseling and a two - week caving expedition have got him to a place where he 's happy			1
" just one of those things , fall off the bike and get back on it			0
i did n't want to have a hang - up			1
but i have found a new career			0
" @entity0 's @entity390 contributed to this report .			0
