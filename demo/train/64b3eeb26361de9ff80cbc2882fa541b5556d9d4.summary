-- @entity4 @entity3 leader @entity2 , whose notoriety includes allegedly recruiting children as suicide bombers , is being targeted by the @entity8 , the @entity1 announced thursday			1
" widely considered to be the deadliest of all @entity12 's commanders , @entity2 and the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) have taken responsibility for many lethal suicide bombings throughout @entity4 , " the @entity1 said in a news release on @entity2			1
the released cited a string of such attacks , including a blast last september that killed at least 54 people at a rally in @entity20 and a car bombing the same month that killed at least 17 people -- including four children -- in @entity25			2
even among militant groups known for brutal violence , @entity2 has a notorious reputation			2
he is alleged to have recruited dozens of @entity4 children as suicide bombers ( a form of attack in which he reportedly is an expert trainer ) and has boasted of personally beheading enemies			1
after the abortive @entity38 bombing in @entity39 last year , his voice was purportedly on the audio tape that claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the @entity12			1
on several occasions , @entity4 officials have claimed that he has been killed			0
no evidence has ever been presented , and it seems that @entity2 is still somewhere in the rugged mountains along the @entity48 - @entity4 border -- most likely in @entity49			1
he is well connected in jihadist circles			0
he is a cousin of the current leader of the @entity12 , @entity51 ( himself a target of @entity8 drone attacks ) , and terrorism analysts believe he has good contacts with other groups active in the region			0
not that those contacts have always been cordial -- @entity4 media reported in 2008 a feud over the fate of a @entity62 geologist who was being held by @entity2 's group			1
rather than hand him over to another faction , they slit his throat			0
@entity2 comes from the @entity68 , which is prominent in @entity49 and includes several other leading figures in the @entity4 @entity3			1
but he also spent time as a boy in @entity72 , attending a hard - line sunni " madrassa " or religious school			0
a @entity4 journalist , @entity76 , wrote last year of a meeting with @entity2 , who claimed to have been active in militant groups since boyhood			1
@entity76 quoted him as saying : " i was very young when i joined @entity80 and actively took part in @entity83 activities ; i also remained for a short time with @entity85 ... later on i focused on jihad in @entity49			0
" both @entity80 and the @entity88 group are militant @entity89 groups involved in terrorism in @entity4 and @entity92 @entity91			0
@entity88 has repeatedly threatened to export terror attacks to @entity94			0
according to @entity76 , he also claimed to be just 22 years of age			0
others who have met him say that @entity2 appears to be in his early 40s			0
in january 2008 , the @entity4 army launched " @entity101 " against a @entity2 stronghold in @entity100			2
while many @entity3 fighters were killed and his house was destroyed , @entity2 escaped			0
but @entity4 forces uncovered a " school " that he is said to have run for child suicide bombers , along with videos of classes			1
@entity4 maj. gen. @entity109 described the school as " like a factory " which had been turning 9 - to 12 - year old boys into suicide bombers			1
the @entity1 's designation of @entity115 says he " has gained particular notoriety for his heavy recruitment of children			2
" undaunted , @entity2 shifted his operations to @entity49 and later released a 40 - minute video in which teenagers and young men declared their intent to become suicide bombers			1
by this time , he was the commander of @entity124 , a group within the @entity4 @entity3 that specialized in suicide bombings			2
these were aimed at the @entity4 state and military , and included attacks on federal and police offices in @entity132			0
but they were also aimed at @entity4 's @entity135 minority			2
a @entity135 procession in @entity132 in september 2010 was attacked by a @entity3 suicide bomber , who killed 33 people			0
the number of suicide attacks rose dramatically between 2007 and 2010 , and most were blamed on or claimed by the @entity4 @entity3			2
it was in may 2010 that the @entity4 @entity3 was linked to its first attempted attack in the @entity8 @entity144 attempted to leave a car bomb in @entity39 's @entity38			1
it failed to go off , but an audio tape released hours later purported to feature the voice of @entity2 in claiming that " the recent attack " was in response to @entity8 " interference and terrorism in @entity153 countries , especially in @entity4			1
" it 's not known whether @entity2 met or trained @entity144 , but it seems likely that he was involved in the suicide bombing of the @entity159 base in @entity160 , @entity48 , at the end of 2009			2
before the attack , the suicide bomber recorded a video with @entity51 , and as the @entity4 @entity3 's expert trainer of suicide bombers , @entity2 likely helped him prepare for the mission			1
in its designation , the @entity1 says " @entity2 is believed to have trained the @entity170 militant @entity171 " who carried out the @entity160 attack , killing seven @entity8 citizens			0
the @entity4 government has declared a reward of 50 million rupees ( $ 600,000 ) for his capture , but @entity2 has evaded both capture and the much - expanded @entity8 drone campaign			1
the @entity8 action against @entity2 blocks all property " subject to @entity8 jurisdiction in which @entity2 has an interest " and prohibits all transactions by @entity8 persons with @entity2			0
given his record so far , it is unlikely to have much impact on his role within the @entity4 @entity3 .			0

a tape released after the @entity38 bomb attempt purportedly featured his voice
