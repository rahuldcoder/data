" the new version of the half - hour sitcom is bring re-imagined by the " @entity17 " creator as an hour - long series exploring how the monster house came about , and will have a darker and less campy feel than the black - and - white original			1
' @entity20 ' : see new ' @entity22 ' trailer " the @entity11 " was launched the same year as the rather similar " @entity23 , " which goes to show in this season of dueling fairy tale dramas ( " @entity26 , " " @entity27 " ) that networks have n't changed all that much			2
while @entity30 was based off @entity30 ' @entity32 cartoons , the " @entity11 " patriarch @entity29 was basically a play on @entity34			0
there 's a couple other projects that could impact " the @entity11 ' " fate			2
@entity6 is also developing a remake of " @entity34 " from " @entity42 " producers @entity40 and @entity41 , while @entity9 is working on another monstrous project for @entity6 -- a series version of @entity46 ' " @entity47 " novels			1
get more @entity0 : subscribe to the magazine for only 39Â ¢ an issue ! there 's no reason why @entity6 could n't opt to make more than one of these titles , but of these three i 'd most like to see the " @entity59 " series ( and bet , as a crime procedural , it would have the best odds for success )			0
