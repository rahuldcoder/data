-- @entity2 's turbulent reign as @entity4 manager took another battering on the day his supposed successor , @entity6 , agreed a deal to become the new manager of @entity9			2
@entity2 , who was appointed as @entity4 interim manager in november following the dismissal of @entity12 , was left stunned after his team squandered a two - goal lead to draw 2 - 2 with lowly @entity15			1

@entity6 agrees three - year deal with @entity9 a 1 - 0 defeat by bottom side @entity27 was followed by a 2 - 0 loss in the @entity29 against @entity30			2
@entity2 has managed just one home win in six attempts in all competitions since taking over , while he has triumphed in six of the seven away fixtures			0
but few expected @entity4 to drop points against a @entity15 team which they had demolished 5 - 1 in the @entity38 on january 5			1
@entity4 suffers home humiliation new signing @entity40 and @entity43 midfielder @entity42 had given @entity4 a comfortable advantage at the break as the @entity46 dominated			2
but @entity15 , which has lost just two of its previous 12 league games , refused to accept defeat and launched a stirring fightback			0
substitute @entity51 headed home his 10th goal of the season with 58 minutes gone before @entity54 netted a dramatic equalizer with 15 minutes remaining			0
the result leaves @entity4 in third place , six points behind @entity60 and just two ahead of @entity61 rivals @entity58			0
@entity62 : the man who saved @entity19 -- twice elsewhere , @entity19 booked its place in the fourth round of the @entity38 and a home tie against @entity67 following a narrow 1 - 0 win over @entity69			1
@entity70 , who missed a second half penalty , scored the only goal of the game after nine minutes			0
@entity74 will play second tier @entity75 in the fourth round after edging out @entity30 1 - 0 courtesy of @entity79 's spectacular strike			1
@entity80 leads @entity81 to new record meanwhile , @entity81 was held to a 2 - 2 draw in the first leg of its @entity86 quarterfinal by 10 - man @entity87 at @entity89			1
@entity87 , which was soundly beaten 3 - 1 by @entity81 in @entity90 last weekend , took a surprise lead through @entity92 after 26 minutes			1
but @entity81 , which has not lost a domestic game this season , hit back through @entity80 and @entity95 to lead 2 - 1 at the interval			1
@entity97 , a halftime substitute for @entity87 , was then sent off with 15 minutes remaining to leave the visitor facing an uphill task			0
but with @entity81 seemingly coasting to victory , @entity101 popped up at the death to fire home and ensure the two teams will start level on january 24			0
in @entity109 , @entity108 's extra-time strike booked @entity111 's place in the semifinals of the @entity113			2
@entity108 scored the only goal of the game as @entity111 recorded a 1 - 0 win at @entity117 to set up a last - four clash with @entity119			0
@entity120 comes early for @entity121 in @entity123 , @entity122 sealed its place in the final of the @entity126 following a 2 - 0 win over league champion @entity128			2
@entity130 and @entity131 scored the goals to set up a final clash with @entity134 on april 20 .			0

@entity19 and @entity74 *progress* to fourth round of @entity38 with nervy victories

@entity111 through to semifinal of @entity113
