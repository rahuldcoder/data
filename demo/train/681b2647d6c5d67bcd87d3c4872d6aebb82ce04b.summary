editor 's note : two - time oscar winner @entity2 joined the @entity3			1
@entity4 in @entity5 at the age of 6 and remained an active member for the next 12 years			2
the actor credits his early years spent at the club with changing the direction of his life			2
since 1994 , he has served as a volunteer national spokesman for @entity13 , appearing in public service announcements on television and in print			1
he 's also a member of the group 's board			2
@entity2 says @entity20 's leaders need to pay attention to the crisis affecting our children			1
( @entity25 ) -- with the political season in full swing , much is at stake for @entity20			2
the economy is in a downward spiral			2
we have an energy crisis			0
our jobless rate is on the rise			0
these are the subjects that generate headlines and much debate among the candidates			0
but there is an underlying problem that we as a nation have not addressed , a situation that should concern any @entity20 with an eye on the future , regardless of party affiliation			0
it is the crisis affecting our children : nearly 30 percent of this year 's freshman class will drop out of high school , according to the @entity50			1
that number jumps to 40 percent in some urban areas			0
the obesity rate for our kids has gone up by as much as 300 percent since 1980 , according to the @entity56 , triggering a host of health - related problems , from diabetes to heart disease			1
young people account for more than 20 percent of violent crimes in the @entity20 , according to statistics cited by @entity65 's @entity64			1
violent juvenile crime peaks between 3 and 4 p.m. , at the end of the school day			1
these facts are grim enough			0
factor in persistent patterns of poverty , gang activity , drug abuse and teenage pregnancy , and you have a generation of @entity78 that will be unprepared -- indeed , unable -- to meet the challenges posed by a complex world			0
we expect our leaders to lead			0
but as citizens , we should n't simply sit back and hope that politicians stand up to the test			1
we can participate in the political process , advocating for policies that will benefit the health , education and well - being of @entity78 , because we must do a better job of preparing our youth to lead			1
it is daunting to think about solving such a widespread crisis			0
but there are youth - serving organizations that can and do play a key role in effecting positive change -- places such as @entity13 , with a long track record of helping young people turn things around , get an education , lead healthy lives and become effective leaders			1
i know , because i was one of those kids			0
club staff taught me right from wrong and made the lesson stick			0
they planted the seeds early on that led me to envision myself as a high school graduate , a college graduate and an achiever in whatever field i chose			0
@entity13 do this today for millions of kids , offering everything from homework help to career exploration , performing a daily miracle that turns hope into opportunity			1
urging children and the adults in their lives to " @entity128 , " these clubs communicate the idea that there is potential for greatness in every child			2
this powerful call to action reminds us that we can all play a role in helping youth realize their dreams			1
so i ask you to join me in this effort			0
there are many ways to help : volunteering at a local youth organization			1
donating to charities that make a difference			0
in partnership with government , schools , community leaders and parents , we can create a network and culture in which everyone embraces the importance of a positive future for our youth			2
but right now , with @entity160 fast approaching , ask your local , state and national candidates what they are doing to help our young people become tomorrow 's leaders			1
ask them to make children a top priority and tell them that you hold them accountable			1
if we all become advocates for our children , elected officials might just take action			2
and if we care about our nation 's future , we must do better			0
