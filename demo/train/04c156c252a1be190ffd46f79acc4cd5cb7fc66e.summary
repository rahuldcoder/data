-- the patent war between @entity2 and @entity3 may be only just starting			1
a new report says @entity2 has acquired 750 patents from computer - systems giant @entity6			1
the news comes shortly after @entity3 sued @entity2 for patent infringement over 10 of its software patents			1
a " person with knowledge of the transaction " tipped the news to @entity12 , though the deal has n't been made public yet			0
compared to other tech companies , @entity2 's arsenal of patents is rather meager : the company has just 56 patents compared with the thousands stockpiled by the likes of @entity24 and @entity25			1
however , the report says , @entity2 has applied to the @entity27 for at least 500 more			2
apparently it did n't want to wait for those to be approved and chose to take a shortcut in stocking up its patent portfolio			0
the lawsuit from @entity3 , which has recently had a wholesale change in management and is expected to announce layoffs , likely provided the motivation			0
