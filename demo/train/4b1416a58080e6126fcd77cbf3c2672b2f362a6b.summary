@entity0 , @entity1 -- the fact - checkers have been out in force for months			1
with the presidential and vice presidential debates fully under way , and both parties claiming that their opponents are liars , websites and news shows are inundated with experts and reporters who inform voters about whether candidates are making claims that have little basis in fact			1
like the card game " @entity21 , " in which players call fellow players when they lie about what card has been put into the collective pile , the fact - checkers shout out to @entity26 when they find that politicians are injecting falsehood into the news cycle			1
but it is not clear what impact the fact checkers are having on the public at large or , nearly as important , on the politicians			1
they keep laying out the facts and the politicians keep stretching the truth			1
there is little evidence that the public is outraged by any of the revelations nor that it has any real influence on how the politicians conduct themselves , other than to provide more campaign fodder for attacks on their opponents			1
complete coverage : @entity48 what is going on ? why does all the new access to data via the @entity52 and the cottage industry of fact - checking experts seem to have so little influence on the basic dynamics of the election ? even with live bloggers tracking every word during the debate , the candidates are having no trouble stretching the truth or fabricating facts for their own purposes			1
at least thus far the polls do n't seem to be registering any significant effects when the candidates are called out for doing this			2
why is n't there a penalty for lying ? one of the biggest challenges for fact - checkers is that they must work in a political culture that , since the 1970s has been deeply distrustful of government and politicians			1
polls consistently show that trust in government has steadily fallen since @entity81 with just a few temporary upticks			2
the public does n't think much of politicians , nor do they ever expect them to tell the truth			1
we live with the ghosts of @entity88			0
so when fact - checking organizations try to point out when politicians are stretching the truth , giving them @entity95 noses for having made claims that have little bearing in fact , the public just is n't surprised			1
in fact , these revelations just confirm the general impression that the public has of their leaders			1
as a result , the fact - checkers fade in the noise of the media frenzy over the campaign			1
fact - checkers must also work within a media environment that has become more polarized and openly partisan in recent years			1
as the norms of objectivity have weakened in many news outlets and reporters become more vocal about their political views , @entity26 tend to rely on websites and television stations where they expect to hear news with the partisan slant that they prefer			0
it is harder to find news that is really fair and balanced ; the public assumes that everything they hear or read has an agenda			0
it is difficult for any source to break through this belief			0
objective fact - checkers must also compete with openly partisan fact - checkers			2
the political parties and other political organizations have turned these operations to their own ends			0
they have released information attacking the veracity of their opponents , playing into an argument that has become important to their campaign			0
it 's hard for people to distinguish between partisan and real fact - checkers			2
@entity146 have made a central theme of this campaign how republicans are not telling the truth			0
" facts matter , " @entity151 said during the vice presidential debate			0
after @entity155 's acceptance speech at the convention , @entity146 released an onslaught of attacks going through his claims			0
we have seen this same dynamic after the debates as well			0
@entity149 have responded in kind			0
@entity164 clarifies @entity151 's remarks on @entity166 the partisanship that shapes our politics has many costs			0
@entity173 has trouble making decisions , tensions among voters over certain issues are often severe , and the quality of our discourse often suffers			0
perhaps one of the worst effects of partisanship , however , has been the fact that the truth is much harder to discern and , in many cases , voters do n't even expect it			2
the public lives in a world where it seems impossible to know what is fact and what is partisan fiction			2
fact checkers , many of whom have legitimate and virtuous objectives to get @entity26 to really understand the choices before them , have trouble gaining much traction			2
when one of the players calls " @entity21 " during the political cycle , people might be listening , but it 's not clear that there are lasting consequences			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			1

@entity207 : fact checking has grown *tremendously* in this election
he says the process is a good one , but is anyone paying attention to the results ?
@entity207 says there seems to be no penalty for politicians who lie
