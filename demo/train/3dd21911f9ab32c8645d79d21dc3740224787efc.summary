@entity1 , @entity0 -- open any fashion magazine and you 're instantly bombarded with a collection of blindingly beautiful celebrities , bedazzled with shimmering jewels and perfectly coiffed " messy hair			0
" @entity9 has been a @entity10 fan since the 1970s			2
do you own a wrap dress ? tell us why			1
they teeter on gorgeous stilettos strutting their perfectly toned figures in clothing that could cost as much as a typical mortgage			0
close that same fashion magazine -- or maybe ever - so - gently hurl it at the wall -- and perhaps you 're left feeling slightly inadequate and envious			0
after all , why should we be left out of all the fun just because we ca n't afford the clothing in the magazine ? but there is one fashion item that has arguably been bridging the gap for more than three decades between the wealthy elite and the average woman			2
this item is @entity10 's wrap dress			1
just like the " @entity32 , " @entity10 's wrap dress is considered an essential in many womens ' wardrobes			1
@entity10 , or @entity10 as she 's known , sold her first wrap dress in the 1970s			1
" it has been a unique phenomenon , " the @entity37 designer told @entity2			1
" what was new about my wrap dress was that i did it in jersey and therefore it molded the body and it was very flattering to the body			1
" technically speaking , a wrap dress is like a kimono			1
" it 's a very traditional form of clothing , it 's a dress that has no buttons and no zipper , " said @entity50			2
since its inception , millions have flown off the racks			0
but that is n't to say the dress did n't see its dark periods as well			0
there was a time when the trend for wrap dresses was declared over , but like any good ( or bad ) fashion , it experienced a revival			1
" @entity67 changed completely and things went away , " said @entity50			0
" ten years ago i started again because i saw that very hip young girls were buying them in thrift shops			0
" that trend continues today			0
while the dresses are stocked in @entity10 stores , they are regularly bought and sold in vintage stores and through online auction sites , such as @entity78			2
" my love affair with the @entity10 wrap dress began in the 1970s , " says @entity9 , a self - confessed " @entity10 addict " from @entity79			1
" one of my first purchases was a yellow floral vintage @entity10 shirtdress that i found at goodwill in @entity85 for $ 4.75			0
" i think what i love the most about @entity10 's designs is that each one has its own special personality -- just like the woman who is wearing it , " @entity9 said			1
@entity2 asked other women to tell us what it is about @entity10 dresses that make them so special			1
tell us your story -- " @entity100 " below			0
" they make me feel not only sexy , but successful , sophisticated and timeless , " said @entity101 , a 24 - year - old @entity10 devotee from @entity102			0
@entity104 from @entity105 told us : " for me , the iconic prints represent a sense of powerful femininity and the promise of endless possibilities			0
" @entity111 of the @entity112 has been wearing @entity10 dresses for the last ten years			2
she said : " like a lot of women , i have varied in size from year to year			0
as a result , my wrap dresses range from size four to size 10			1
" @entity119 , also from the @entity112 , recently sold one of her @entity10 dresses on @entity78			2
" i like to change my selection , " she said			0
" buying vintage wrap dresses makes them more affordable for me , yet i still get the benefit as if i were buying new due to their classic cuts and their durability			1
" do you own a wrap dress ? if so , we want to hear from you			1
why did you buy it and what does it mean to you ? " sound off " below or email us a picture or go to @entity2 's facebook page -- facebook.com / cnnintl .			2
