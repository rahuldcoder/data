-- december 6 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			0
unidentified students : welcome to @entity0 with @entity15 ! @entity16 , @entity17 : now that is how you get a show poppin ' ! thank you gentlemen very much			2
welcome , all of you , to a new week of @entity0 ! i 'm @entity15 , and we thank all our viewers from all over the world for tuning in			0
first up : unemployment report @entity29 : the first friday of every month , the @entity31 government usually announces the current unemployment rate			1
bad news : this past friday 's announcement came as a surprise ; the rate went up to 9.8 percent			1
it had been 9.6 percent for several months			0
some experts were predicting it would stay the same			0
more than 15 million @entity31 looking for work , not good news			1
but there are some people who are actually encouraged by the increase			0
the unemployment rate only counts people who are actively looking for jobs			0
so if the rate goes up , it could mean that @entity31 who 'd stopped looking think they have a better chance of finding work , so they 're back on the job hunt			1
still , analysts say it is disappointing the overall job market has n't gotten better			2
@entity56 @entity29 : president @entity57 is back in @entity58 after a trip to @entity4			1
he made a surprise visit there on friday , meeting with thousands of @entity31 troops			1
this is his second trip to @entity4 since he became president			1
@entity65 has more on the president 's time in @entity4 and why it did n't go exactly as planned			1
( begin video ) @entity69 , @entity0 @entity70 : it was a secret trip the @entity72 says was in the works for more than a month ; flying into @entity74 for a little more than four hours to salute the men and women who are carrying out the administration 's stepped - up strategy in @entity4			1
@entity57 , @entity79 : this part of the world is the center of a global effort where we are going to disrupt and dismantle and defeat @entity85 and its extremist allies , and that 's why you 're here			1
@entity89 : but ahead of a mid-december review , what is being called a comprehensive assessment to possibly tweak the president 's policy there , challenges remain			1
there 's rampant corruption in the @entity4 government , highlighted by leaked state department cables in which ambassador @entity101 is said to be concerned about " how to fight corruption when key government officials are themselves corrupt			1
" and then there is the continued @entity106 threat			0
@entity57 : you 're going on the offense			1
i 'm tired of playing defense			0
pushing them out of their strongholds			0
@entity89 : mr. @entity57 had planned on flying to @entity115 to meet with president @entity116 and visit @entity31 embassy employees			1
but a storm rolled in with high winds , dust and low cloud cover , so his helicopter trip was canceled , and the @entity116 meeting became a 15 - minute phone call			1
the president did visit wounded troops at a base hospital , awarding five @entity128 , and met with members of the @entity130 who lost six members in a deadly attack earlier this week			2
@entity57 : there are going to be difficult days ahead			1
progress comes at a high price			0
@entity89 : thirteen hundred @entity31 troops have been killed in @entity4 since the war began			1
this year was especially deadly			0
the @entity57 administration plans to start withdrawing troops from @entity4 in july 2011 , and a stable , reliable government there is key to meeting that deadline			1
as for whether or not those @entity145 documents could cause more problems for the @entity57 administration , one top aide says that they 've weathered these kinds of revelations in the past and that there 's no secret about the challenges they 're facing in @entity4 , especially when it comes to corruption in the government there			1
@entity65 , @entity0 , the @entity72			0
( @entity158 ) tax vote in @entity160 @entity29 : moving to the legislative branch of @entity31 government and the debate over some tax cuts we 've been talking about recently			1
these are cuts that were made under president @entity168			2
they are set to expire			0
if they do , it means @entity31 ' taxes will go up			1
everyone seems to be in favor of extending the cuts for families who make less than $ 250,000 a year			0
the debate is over extending those tax cuts for families that make more money than that			0
saturday , the @entity160 voted not to extend the cuts for anyone , but @entity185 and @entity186 leaders are hopeful they they can still work out a compromise			0
@entity188 @entity189 , @entity17 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity192 's social studies classes at @entity193 in @entity194 , @entity195 ! which of these words means a fee that countries have to pay when they import something ? is it : a ) default , b ) inflation , c ) subsidy or @entity206 ) tariff ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the fee or tax on products that are imported is called a tariff			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! trade with @entity5 @entity29 : a new deal between the @entity31 and @entity5 would get rid of a lot of tariffs			1
president @entity57 announced the plan on saturday			1
over the next five years , it would eliminate 95 percent of the tariffs on industrial and consumer products that @entity5 imports from the @entity31			1
the president says this agreement will mean billions of dollars in @entity31 exports and support 70,000 @entity31 jobs			1
other folks do n't see it that way			2
in fact , they argue that this trade agreement will actually cost @entity31 jobs			1
the president had hoped to finalize the deal with @entity5 when he was in that country last month			1
there were some disagreements about specific details that caused the delay			0
@entity242 @entity29 : @entity6 is a country in southeastern @entity243			0
it 's a little smaller than the @entity31 state of @entity246 , and it 's home to about 3 million people			1
12,000 of them have had to leave their homes because of this : massive flooding caused by severe rain			0
you can see some of the damage in these photos sent in by an ireporter			0
huge areas of land are underwater			0
thousands of homes have flooded			0
officials have declared a state of emergency , and troops and police are helping out in the rescue efforts			0
@entity267 @entity29 : @entity7 's cabinet has promised speedy relief to victims of a deadly wildfire in that country			2
the prime minister , @entity273 , says he wants the people who were affected to be able to go back to their homes or to alternative housing within days			2
the fire broke out on thursday			0
it 's killed at least 40 people and injured at least 17 others			2
as of sunday , it was still burning in a few places , but authorities said the major sources had been extinguished			0
@entity7 is getting help from other countries , including the @entity31 , @entity288 and @entity289			1
and @entity290 -- a group that 's often at odds with @entity7 -- are helping out here too			2
@entity294 @entity295 , @entity296 : you will see the kids walking , you know , kind of looking down and texting away , when there 's 50 kids around them they could be talking to			2
@entity304 , @entity305 : i facebook after i get home from school , and then i do my homework , and then i facebook some more			2
@entity310 , @entity311 : i 'm not on it 24/7 , but i could cut back			0
i know my mom would love it			0
@entity315 @entity29 : all right , if that sounds familiar , we 're all guilty of this at some point or other			0
as you can see from our stack of smartphones and cell phones right here , technology and social networking are everywhere			2
but for one week , there 's a school district in @entity328 that 's going unplugged as part of a social experiment			1
and this is what we mean by unplugged : more than 400 students , teachers and staff have promised to give up texting , @entity337 , @entity338 and cell phones ! the teacher who came up with the idea says people are losing the ability to have face - to - face communication			1
students have been promoting the experiment on @entity338			1
all of it starts today			2
the students who are taking part are on the honor system , but they 've given their cell numbers to teachers who will use " spies " to try and test them			2
blog report @entity29 : we 're covering this on our blog today ; you probably guessed that already			2
but about friday 's blog on a high school football player who got flagged after praying in the end zone , @entity360 says she would not stop pointing to the sky after scoring			1
she would let go of the ball first , though , since that 's supposedly what triggered the flag			2
@entity370 's class agreed with dropping the ball first , writing that " people of faith should be able to show it , but they still have to follow rules			2
" @entity376 , like several of you , talked about the @entity378 and said " the player had every right to say a prayer			0
" look at this : 93 percent of you thought @entity384 should not have been penalized for what he did			0
@entity386 says it 's offensive on the ref 's part because it 's like he 's saying " no following religion on a football field			2
" @entity392 says " the player was n't celebrating ; he was thanking @entity394			0
as a football player myself , they should get rid of that rule altogether			0
" @entity400 reminder for you : we only publish comments with first names ; we only read first names on the show			0
before we go @entity29 : all right , today 's before we go segment is about someone who 's just a giant baby			1
well , he 's kinda cute now			0
he only weighs about 2 pounds			0
just wait ' til he 's full - grown and weighs 200 pounds ! this little guy is just a month old			1
we 'd like to tell you his name , but he wo n't get that until he 's 100 days old			2
that 's a tradition in @entity416 , where pandas are from			0
this check - up was to make sure he 's healthy , in good shape , and eating well			2
goodbye @entity29 : you know , all the bear essentials			0
that about cub - bers it for today 's program			1
we hope you have a great day			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity15 .			0
