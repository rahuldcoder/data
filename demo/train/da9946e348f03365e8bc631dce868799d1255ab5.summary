-- @entity1 , how things change ! a decade ago , @entity4 's opposition to the @entity6 - led invasion of @entity7 caused such disdain that restaurants across the @entity6 began calling @entity4 fries " freedom fries			1
" some @entity6 bandied around the term " cheese - eating surrender monkeys , " coined by tv show " @entity15 , " for their @entity17 cousins , while then - @entity19 prime minister @entity18 became @entity21 's bff			1
yet on friday , as the @entity6 tried to rally support for military intervention in @entity25 , secretary of state @entity22 had only fond words for the @entity4 , calling them " our oldest ally			1
" @entity29 , in turn , described the two nations as " close friends and allies			0
" meanwhile , @entity19 -- whose @entity33 voted against military intervention in an embarrassing defeat for prime minister @entity37 -- was relegated to an unfamiliar backseat position as @entity39 gears up for potential combat			1
so did @entity22 's words signal a new era in @entity4 - @entity44 relations ? while @entity4 has been a historical ally of the @entity6 , going back more than two centuries to the @entity49 , in more recent times the @entity4 and their @entity44 cousins have not always marched to the beat of the same drummer			1
@entity4 president @entity53 was sharply critical of the @entity21 administration as it tried to drum up support to invade @entity7 in 2003 without a @entity58 mandate			1
" @entity7 today does not represent an immediate threat that justifies an immediate war , " he said in march 2003			2
his opposition earned him then - defense secretary @entity63 's scorn , as he dismissed @entity4 as belonging to " old @entity64			2
" undeterred , @entity53 's tone was no softer six months later , when he addressed the @entity66 in @entity67			0
" the war , launched without the authorization of the @entity70 , shook the multilateral system , " he said			0
" the @entity58 has just been through one of the most grave crises in its history			0
" when former president @entity76 launched air strikes back in 1986 on sites connected to @entity80 dictator @entity79 , after an incident in which @entity80 agents had bombed a disco in @entity84 , killing two @entity6 , @entity4 denied @entity6 planes access to its airspace , according to news reports from the time			1
the aircraft instead took off from @entity19			0
at that point , @entity90 was in the presidential palace , while @entity53 was prime minister			0
more recently , @entity29 told president @entity93 during an @entity95 meeting days after he was elected to the @entity4 presidency that he would stand by his campaign pledge to withdraw @entity4 combat troops from @entity99 by the end of the year			0
@entity4 was one of the bigger contributors of troops to the @entity105 - led @entity104 , making its withdrawal a blow to the @entity93 administration			2
but when @entity79 was again in the sights of the international community in 2011 , as @entity80 rebels fought for his ouster , then - president @entity109 was an enthusiastic participant in the conflict			0
@entity4 fighter planes bombarded @entity118 forces as part of a @entity105 effort also spearheaded by @entity19 , while the @entity6 kept a low profile			1
@entity109 and @entity37 gave a passionate speech together in the @entity80 city of @entity124 , newly united after the divisions prompted by the war in @entity7			2
@entity4 's involvement did n't do much to help @entity109 's re-election effort the following may , when he lost out to @entity29 , but it did perhaps indicate a willingness by @entity4 's leaders to re-engage with international diplomacy			0
@entity29 has carried on the trend , sending @entity4 forces into @entity134 , at the @entity137 nation 's invitation , to help push back militant @entity138 earlier this year			0
but if international strikes on @entity25 go ahead , and @entity4 plays a part , @entity29 may be in need of his transatlantic buddies			1
nearly two out of three @entity4 people are opposed to a military intervention in @entity25 led by an international coalition including @entity4 , according to figures released saturday by one of the country 's main polling agencies and published by daily newspaper @entity150			1
another survey , by the @entity152 polling agency , suggested 58 % of those surveyed do not trust @entity29 to lead a military intervention in @entity25			0
but while @entity29 is currently the @entity93 administration 's golden boy , it 's probably too soon to count out the long - running @entity44 friendship hailed , in @entity19 at least , as the " special relationship			1
" foreign secretary @entity160 made it onto @entity22 's call list friday -- and @entity93 and @entity37 are also still speaking			0
a readout of their call friday from the @entity166 said that the @entity6 " values the special relationship with the @entity19 , a close ally and friend			1
" and a 10 @entity171 readout of the same call said @entity93 " stressed his appreciation of his strong friendship with the prime minister and of the strength , durability and depth of the special relationship between our two countries			2
" the @entity184 defeat was clearly a blow for @entity37 , who has repeatedly spoken of the need for robust action on @entity25 , but the loss of @entity19 support for potential @entity6 action is more symbolic than militarily significant			1
the two nations have weathered plenty of storms together in the past and will likely find themselves back on the same page in future			0
@entity39 stood behind @entity19 when it went to war against @entity199 in 1982 , following the @entity199 invasion of the @entity201 , a disputed @entity19 territory in the @entity202			1
the two were also key allies during @entity205 , leading then - prime minister @entity206 to first describe their bond in 1946 as the " special relationship " that would help prevent future wars and bolster world stability			2
in the meantime , @entity93 can cozy up with @entity4 , @entity212 -- which has also voiced support for military intervention -- and other @entity216 regional players , while @entity37 nurses his wounded pride			2
@entity0 's @entity218 and @entity219 contributed to this report .			0

secretary of state @entity22 hails @entity4 as the @entity6 ' " oldest ally "
@entity19 , which touts its " special relationship " with the @entity6 , wo n't join military action in @entity25
@entity227 and @entity39 have not always seen eye - to - eye , notably on the 2003 @entity7 invasion
@entity4 also *declined* to support @entity6 strikes on @entity80 under @entity76 in 1986
