a midterm election sometimes arrives like a tidal wave , sweeping one party 's incumbents out of office and bringing in a new majority			1
for @entity8 , their wave came in 2006			1
for republicans , theirs came in 2010			1
as the next midterm election approaches , however , there are few signs of a tsunami			1
2014 seems likely to reproduce divided government and , with it , even more of the partisan polarization that has become endemic in @entity18 politics			1
thus , the next election seems unlikely to change the dynamics that have produced the partial government shutdown			1
loyalty to a political party is not just a feature of @entity25			0
it is , and has always been , a pre-eminent force in @entity18 elections			1
nine in 10 @entity18 identify with or lean toward a party , and most vote loyally for that party			0
in our book , " @entity36 , " we document the powerful role partisanship played in the 2012 election			2
in partnership with @entity38 , we interviewed 45,000 @entity18 online in december 2011 and then interviewed most of them again after the election			2
of those voters who described themselves as @entity10 or @entity8 that december , more than 90 % voted for their party 's candidate			1
voters who were undecided in december also tended to vote in line with their underlying partisan loyalties			0
the same party loyalty has increasingly carried over into congressional elections as well			2
this is one reason why split - ticket voting has dropped so precipitously in the last 40 years			0
some maintain that the 2012 election inaugurated an " @entity53 realignment " or " @entity54			2
" as we argue in " @entity36 , " it was always unlikely that the election signaled @entity8 or liberal ascendance			2
in reality , @entity53 won despite a sharp conservative turn in public opinion and despite being perceived as ideologically further from the average voter than @entity63 was			0
the election mainly signaled just how narrowly divided the country is			2
heading into 2014 , a set of cross-currents seems likely to maintain this partisan balance			2
@entity10 have more seats to defend in the @entity70 , and history shows that the larger a party 's majority , the more seats the party is likely to lose			1
on top of that , the dismal marks that @entity18 give to @entity25 tend to hurt the majority party in the @entity70 most			0
but the @entity8 face their own challenges			0
two key fundamentals in both presidential and midterm elections are the economy and presidential approval			1
at the moment , the economy is growing only slowly , and approval of @entity53 has dropped 8 points since january			0
both factors could end up hurting congressional @entity8			0
moreover , in the @entity89 the @entity8 must try to hold seats in @entity10 - leaning states like @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			1
when you put these factors together , republicans are currently forecast to gain a small number of seats in both chambers , although this could be enough to give them a narrow majority in the @entity89			0
is the shutdown likely to change this dynamic and strengthen @entity53 's hand against @entity10 ? probably not			1
although the last big shutdown battle in 1995 - 96 did no favors for @entity110 and @entity70 republicans , it did not necessarily help @entity112 in the eyes of voters — contrary to the conventional wisdom today			2
@entity112 's approval was no higher immediately after the two shutdowns than before , and it is unclear whether the increase in his approval later in 1996 stemmed from the shutdown itself			0
moreover , this time @entity18 seem willing to spread the blame for the shutdown			0
they are only slightly less likely to say they will blame @entity53 and the @entity8 than blame republicans			0
indeed , during the last big debt ceiling fight with the @entity10 — in summer 2011 — @entity53 's approval rating dropped 5 points			1
none of this is to say that the shutdown ca n't damage @entity10 , too			1
if the conservative faction of the party continues to drive policy , the dwindling , but vital , number of @entity10 moderates may find themselves electorally vulnerable			1
political science research shows that being more ideologically extreme or partisan than their district can hurt members of @entity25 at the ballot box			0
@entity142 has to find a way to protect moderates — some of whom are clearly chafing -- and placate conservatives at the same time			0
ultimately , the 2014 election seems likely to give us more of the slow grind of divided government			1
this will continue to hamstring both parties and frustrate @entity18 ready for an end to gridlock .			0
