@entity0 , @entity1 -- on " @entity4 , " @entity3 captured the frustration that many of president @entity8 's supporters have felt over the past week as one scandal after another cascaded into the @entity11			1
after starting with a predictable riff accusing @entity13 of ignoring facts when attacking the @entity8 administration , @entity3 turned to the @entity17 story , banged on his desk , and yelled out curses			1
@entity3 then blasted the administration for the revelation that the @entity17 had given extra scrutiny to right - wing organizations			1
" explanation please , " @entity3 said , before playing some comedic clips of @entity25 , the official in charge of handling tax - exempt organizations at the @entity17 , who admits she is not good at math. " well , congratulations , president @entity8 , " @entity3 went on to say			1
" conspiracy theorists , who generally can survive in anaerobic environments , have just had an algae bloom dropped on their f * * * * * g heads			0
thus removing the last arrow in your pro-governance quiver			0
... this has , in one seismic moment , shifted the burden of proof from the tinfoil - behatted to the government			2
" opinion : will scandals stall @entity8 agenda ? this was just one of the scandals to rock the administration within the week			1
the media also reported that the @entity53 had conducted a surveillance operation focusing on journalists for @entity56 , in an effort to find the source behind a leaked story about a foiled terrorist attack			0
many liberal democrats were frustrated and shocked that the administration had permitted the seizure of the phone records , the kind of activities they would certainly have railed against had they happened under president @entity67			0
although there is no evidence that @entity8 was involved in either of these incidents -- and many republicans are clearly trying to use them to drum up a narrative about a scandal - ridden presidency -- the combination left many @entity61 , like @entity3 , scratching their heads , wondering what happened to the president who promised when he ran in 2008 to transform the way politics worked			1
despite controversies , @entity8 approval rating holds steady it is still too early to know all the facts and what the president 's role has been			2
nonetheless , some of the frustration that @entity8 's supporters feel comes from ways in which this @entity11 has too often accepted politics as usual rather than embarking on the transformative changes that he once promised			1
while many of the president 's supporters insist that he has delivered on his promise to push forward a bold policy agenda , few would say that he has fulfilled his goal of changing the way that politics works			1
what happened ? since the resignation of president @entity107 over @entity108 , most presidential candidates have run on the promise to fix a broken @entity110			2
@entity111 , whose 1976 campaign revolved around the basic promise that you could trust him , perfected this message and style of campaigning			0
in one way or another , every candidate -- including @entity8 's predecessor , @entity67 -- has assured voters he would reform government and transform politics			1
but the change does n't happen			0
within four years , as @entity111 discovered , the new boss looks like the old boss and " the system " seems the same			0
most presidents realize once they are in office that reforming @entity110 will consume too much of their political capital , generating more enemies among their opponents as well as within their own party , and the results of any such initiative will probably be negligible			1
instead , once in office , presidents tend to embrace the role of politician and turn their attention to bread - and - butter issues that will matter much more to voters on @entity144			2
the easiest way to achieve policy goals is by working through the existing system rather than trying to remake things			0
transformation is also difficult simply because the size and scale of the executive branch have grown so much over the past century , vastly increasing the odds that things can go wrong			0
within each agency , there are multiple opportunities for unethical bureaucrats , sometimes without presidential knowledge , to do bad things			0
this is part of the reason there have been such strong advocates , on the right and the left , calling for greater -- though less politicized -- congressional oversight and tighter rules to constrain wrongdoing			0
opinion : for @entity8 , it 's no more mr. @entity172 in certain respects , the burden , as @entity3 points out , is greater for liberals , given the centrality of government to their agenda			1
over the past decades the vast expansion of executive power through the homeland security program has also increased the possibilities for wrongdoing			0
people should not be surprised that the @entity53 was so aggressive with the @entity56 phone records			0
after all , @entity8 has kept most of @entity67 's homeland security program in place and has conducted an extraordinarily aggressive program to contain any leaks that threaten the system			1
in defense of the government 's actions , attorney general @entity192 said the leak that it was investigating " put the @entity197 people at risk			0
" reforming government has also fallen victim to the hyperpartisan polarization that defines @entity110			2
from day one in the @entity11 , @entity8 has faced an incredibly hostile @entity204 , unwilling to support almost anything he does			2
this vastly diminished the incentives for him to try to find bipartisan support for reform initiatives , which usually generate a lot of opposition from interests who thrive in the status quo and are rarely priorities for voters on @entity144			0
with campaign finance , another area where @entity8 has greatly disappointed his supporters , @entity8 decided that the only way to beat the @entity204 would be to raise and spend as much money as they did			1
that prompted his decision to turn down federal financing for his campaigns , bringing an end to the @entity228 reforms , and leading to reliance on the @entity230 he once criticized			0
none of this is meant to excuse the kinds of activities that have recently been revealed			0
but @entity197 should not be surprised that the promise of reform vanished under @entity8 and that the problems of government he inherited have not gone away			1
@entity8 to new grads : ' no time for excuses ' ultimately , we will need politicians who are willing to take huge risks in tackling some of the underlying problems with government -- or a scandal so severe that it creates real political pressure for incumbents to do something -- if we are to strengthen our processes and reduce the risks of the kinds of stories we saw this past week			1
scandals can prod elected officials to take reform seriously			2
following @entity108 , a scandal far worse than what we have seen thus far , @entity257 and the president adopted a number of major government reforms that included a new campaign finance system , ethics rules , the @entity266 , and much more			2
while @entity111 has been criticized for many of his failings on domestic and foreign policy , his decision to move forward with reforms in the wake of @entity108 stands as one of his biggest achievements			0
perhaps @entity8 should use this moment as an opportunity to be bold and to return to some of the fundamental ideas for reform that he raised in embarking on his journey to the @entity11			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity284 .			1

@entity3 expressed frustration of @entity8 supporters over @entity17 scandal
@entity8 has not delivered on promises to change @entity110 , says @entity284
he says @entity8 , like other reform - minded presidents , chose to work within the system
