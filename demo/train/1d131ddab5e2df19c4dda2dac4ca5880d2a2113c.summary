@entity0 -- a convicted @entity3 terrorist plotter and his mother lost another legal round wednesday in their efforts to hold accountable a former @entity10 administration official who issued legal memos supporting harsh interrogation techniques for suspected enemy combatants			1
the 9th @entity14 dismissed a lawsuit from @entity16 and his mother , @entity18 , who claimed the man 's constitutional rights were violated when he was held for years in solitary confinement at a military prison in @entity23			1
the issue was whether @entity25 , who worked in the @entity27 's @entity26 , deserved " qualified immunity " as a government official from such suits			1
a federal judge earlier had said the litigation could proceed			0
but a three - judge appeals panel disagreed			2
" under recent @entity36 law , however , we are compelled to conclude that , regardless of the legality of @entity40 's detention and the wisdom of @entity25 's judgments , at the time he acted the law was not sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he was doing violated the plaintiffs ' rights , " the court said			1
@entity40 was originally arrested a decade ago on accusations he planned to set off radioactive " dirty bombs " in the @entity51			0
the @entity54 native had been held for 3 1/2 years as an " enemy combatant " in military confinement , without being charged in that alleged plot			0
it was that detention that prompted @entity40 in 2008 to file a civil lawsuit , alleging the administration 's " unlawful " policies violated his constitutional rights as a @entity51 citizen			2
he said he suffered severe physical and mental abuse during his years of isolation in military detention , and wanted to hold individual officials such as @entity25 accountable			1
the @entity36 in 2004 had heard @entity40 's original appeal over his enemy combatant status , claiming he deserved a chance to contest his military detention on constitutional grounds			0
@entity36 building to get face - lift he was arrested in may 2002 at @entity54 's @entity78 as he returned from overseas , where he had been living			0
he was detained as a material witness in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks investigation			0
president @entity10 designated him an " enemy combatant " the following month and turned him over to the military			0
he was one of the few terror suspects designated by the @entity51 as an enemy combatant since 9/11			0
@entity40 was then held in a @entity23 naval brig before the government brought criminal charges against him			0
the @entity92 administration has since abandoned using the term " enemy combatant			0
" the current @entity95 has been criticized for continuing many of the anti-terror policies of the @entity10 administration , including military prosecutions of high - value suspected terrorists held at the @entity103 base at @entity104 , @entity105			0
the @entity106 had supported @entity25			1
but some conservatives have also slammed president @entity92 for his previous desire to close the prison facility in @entity105 and prosecute terrorists in civilian federal courts in the @entity51			0
that policy has not been carried out due to congressional opposition			0
three @entity51 citizen cases , including @entity40 's , as well as other appeals from foreign nationals held as enemy combatants at @entity104 , have tested the government 's power to interrogate captives without allowing them regular access to attorneys or the judicial system , on the grounds that they might pose a future threat or know about pending terrorist attacks			1
the @entity128 - based 9th circuit appeals court said it was unclear in the two years after the 9/11 attacks whether @entity40 's alleged treatment in prison amounted to " torture			1
" the legal advice offered by @entity25 and other top administration lawyers was intended , said the court , to work through varying differences over interpreting and implementing the detention and interrogation policies			1
the judges in this appeal appeared to go out of their way to note concerns that @entity25 's performance at the @entity26 may have in fact amounted to professional " misconduct			1
" but the panel said his compliance with department standards was not at issue in the current lawsuit			2
the @entity27 later released two reports on the interrogation memos produced by @entity25 , concluding he " exercised poor judgment " but did not " knowingly provide inaccurate legal advice			1
" both reports were summarized in a footnote in the appeals judges ' ruling			2
@entity25 's lawyer released a statement saying the ruling " confirms that this litigation has been baseless from the outset			1
" @entity167 , who himself had been an unsuccessful nominee to the federal bench by @entity10 , said , " for several years , @entity40 and his attorneys have been harassing the government officials he believes to have been responsible for his detention and ultimately conviction as a terrorist			2
he has now lost before two separate courts of appeals , and will need to find a new hobby for his remaining time in prison			1
" after @entity40 was released from military custody and transferred to federal civilian control , he was convicted on terrorism charges			2
in november 2006 , he was added to an existing indictment in south @entity183 , which alleged @entity40 and his co-defendants belonged to a @entity3 terrorist support cell and intended to carry out jihad , or holy war , in foreign countries			2
@entity40 and two others were found guilty in august 2007 of conspiracy to murder @entity51 citizens and provide material support to terrorists			0
a federal court jury in @entity195 had deliberated for just under two days before handing down the guilty verdicts			0
another federal appeals court ruled last fall the 17 - year sentence given @entity40 was too lenient , handing another legal victory to the @entity92 administration			1
a divided 2 - 1 panel of the 11th @entity14 said the federal judge presiding over the 2007 conspiracy trial did not properly take into account the former gang member 's past criminal history when sentencing him			0
the current lawsuit is @entity40 and @entity208 v. @entity25 ( 09 - 16478 ) .			1

an appeals court dismisses a lawsuit filed by convicted terrorist @entity16
he wanted to sue @entity25 , who issued legal memos supporting harsh techniques
the court says that " at the time ( @entity25 ) acted the law was not sufficiently clear "
