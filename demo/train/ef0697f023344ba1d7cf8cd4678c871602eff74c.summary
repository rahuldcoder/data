@entity3 prime minister @entity2 is n't aiming to disrespect president @entity5 or muddy the waters of @entity8 politics when he speaks before @entity9 , the country 's ambassador said sunday			1
" the prime minister 's visit to @entity12 is intended for one purpose -- and one purpose only			1
to speak up while there is still time to speak up			2
to speak up when there is still time to make a difference , " ambassador @entity16 said at an event in @entity18 days after @entity20 speaker @entity19 announced that @entity2 would address @entity9 in march			1
@entity2 is expected to lobby @entity9 to approve tough new sanctions on @entity24			2
the scheduled appearance -- two weeks ahead of an @entity3 election -- caught @entity5 's administration by surprise and has drawn criticism from some @entity31 lawmakers			1
@entity32 acknowledged the criticism sunday night as he spoke at an @entity35 benefit event in @entity36 , @entity18			0
but he said speaking out on @entity24 is part of @entity2 's " sacred duty			1
" " there may be some people who believe that the prime minister of israel should have declined an invitation to speak before the most powerful parliament in the world on an issue that concerns the future and survival of @entity3			0
but we have learned from our history that the world becomes a more dangerous place for the @entity53 people when the @entity53 people are silent , " he said			0
" that is why the prime minister feels the deepest moral obligation to appear before the @entity9 to speak about an existential issue facing the one and only jewish state			0
that is not just the right of the prime minister of israel			0
it is his most sacred duty -- to do whatever he can to prevent @entity24 from ever developing nuclear weapons that can be aimed at @entity3			0
" it 's a case @entity2 has made before			1
in 2012 , he famously held up a drawing of a bomb as he asked the @entity72 to draw " a clear red line " to stop @entity24 from developing nuclear weapons			0
@entity24 , @entity32 said , remains " the world 's most dangerous regime , " and a nuclear deal could endanger @entity3 's future			0
" today , the international community stands at the precipice of forging an agreement with @entity24 over its nuclear program , " @entity79 said			0
" the agreement that is being discussed today is not an agreement that would dismantle @entity24 's nuclear weapons capability , but rather one that could leave @entity24 as a nuclear threshold state			0
" @entity5 has opposed upping sanctions against @entity24 , saying he needs more time to hash out a deal to end @entity24 's nuclear program and that new sanctions would put those talks at risk			1
@entity24 has denied working toward a nuclear weapon , insisting its nuclear program is for civilian purposes			0
@entity19 told reporters last week that he did not consult with the @entity20 about inviting @entity2 , saying " the @entity9 can make this decision on its own			2
" some speculated it was another sign of tense relations between @entity5 and @entity2			1
but @entity32 said sunday that the @entity3 prime minister 's visit is " not intended to wade into ( the @entity8 ) political debate			2
" @entity3 is grateful for @entity5 's support , he said , and support from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle			2
" the prime minister 's visit here is not intended to show any disrespect for president @entity5			1
@entity3 deeply appreciates the strong support we have received from president @entity5 in many areas : in enhanced security cooperation , heightened intelligence sharing , generous military assistance and @entity118 funding , and opposition to anti-israel initiatives at the @entity72 , " @entity32 said			1
" now , i have no doubt that the prime minister will speak very forcefully about that strong support from president @entity5 when he appears before @entity9			1
" @entity4 's @entity124 contributed to this report .			0
