-- the maid who accused former international monetary fund chief @entity2 of sexually assaulting her in a @entity5 hotel room has ended her months - long silence and gone public			1
@entity7 , whose credibility has been questioned by @entity2 's lawyers and prosecutors , spoke to @entity11 for an article posted on its website sunday			1
she also conducted an interview with @entity15 of @entity16 , which is set to air monday on " @entity17			1
" @entity0 previously has not identified @entity7 , given the network 's policy against naming sexual assault victims			1
but it is now naming her , in light of her decision to make her case to the media			0
on may 14 , @entity7 accused @entity2 -- who besides being a global economic leader had been mentioned as a leading contender for the @entity29 presidency -- of assaulting her at @entity31 's @entity30 , where she was an employee			1
he was charged in @entity5 with sexual abuse and attempted rape , pleading not guilty on all counts			2
in an interview conducted at her lawyer 's office in @entity5 , @entity7 told @entity11 that @entity2 was naked when he slammed the door shut to his luxury hotel room , forced himself upon her and tried to make her perform oral sex on him			1
" because of him they call me a prostitute , " @entity7 said , referring to published reports she had sex for money			2
" i want him to go to jail			0
i want him to know there are some places you can not use your power , you can not use your money			0
" the 32 - year - old native of @entity53 told the magazine she was " nervous " and " scared " when she eventually ran from the room , ending an incident that took about 15 minutes			0
yet the fallout has been far more extensive , and continues			0
@entity2 was initially arrested at @entity5 's @entity58 while on board a @entity60 - bound plane			1
his arrest created an international furor , prompting his resignation as @entity66 chief as @entity5 judge @entity67 ordered him held under a $ 6 million bail			2
after posting bond , @entity2 had been confined to a luxury townhouse			2
but on july 1 , the judge freed him from house arrest after prosecutors presented evidence showing that @entity7 admitted she had lied about the specifics of her whereabouts after the incident and , from her past , the details of an asylum application and information she put on tax forms			2
but while the case took a dramatic turn , the charges against the 62 - year - old have not been dismissed			0
and there have been more twists in recent weeks , including writer @entity89 's filing of a complaint accusing @entity2 of attempted rape in @entity29 , stemming from an alleged 2003 incident in @entity60			2
a lawyer for @entity2 in @entity29 said he subsequently filed a counter-claim against @entity95 for false declarations			2
still , most of the intrigue remains centered in the @entity99 , where lawyers for the suspect and the defendant continue to go back and forth challenging each other 's tactics			0
@entity7 's interviews further stoked those fires , prompting strongly worded responses from both sides			1
on sunday , @entity2 's @entity99 - based attorneys @entity110 and @entity111 issued a statement chastising @entity7 for talking with the media , claiming she is " the first accuser in history to conduct a media campaign to persuade a prosecutor to pursue charges against a person from whom she wants money			1
" " the number of rallies , press conferences and media events they have orchestrated is exceeded only by the number of lies and misstatements she has made to law enforcement , friends , medical professionals and reporters , " the lawyers said , referring to her and her attorney 's actions			0
" it is time for this unseemly circus to stop			0
" @entity139 , @entity7 's attorney , shot back accusing @entity2 's attorneys of conducting " an unprecedented smear campaign against the victim of a violent sexual attack			1
" " because of those contemptible , baseless and anonymous attacks , ms. @entity7 was forced to come forward in order to put a face to the brutal crime , " @entity139 said in a statement			0
@entity2 's next court date is scheduled for august 1			1
the hearing had been pushed back from @entity151 as prosecutors tried to determine whether to drop the charges or move forward in the case , said @entity155 , communications director for manhattan district attorney @entity156			0
on sunday , amid the fresh attention related to @entity7 's interviews , @entity155 refrained from comment on what she called the " pending criminal case			1
" " to protect the integrity of the criminal justice system , the rights of the victim , and the rights of the accused , we will not discuss the facts or evidence in what remains an ongoing investigation , " she said in a statement			0
@entity0 's @entity173 contributed to this report .			0

new : the @entity176 declines to comment ; the next @entity5 court date is august 1
@entity7 conducts interviews with @entity11 and @entity16
@entity2 's lawyer claim these are all part of a bid to get a *settlement*
the accuser 's attorney says the defense has conducted a " smear campaign "
