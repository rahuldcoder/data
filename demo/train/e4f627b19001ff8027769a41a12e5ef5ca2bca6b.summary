the death of beloved @entity3 soap opera star @entity2 this week in @entity4 drew a deluge of heartfelt condolences -- from @entity7 to @entity8 , from @entity9 to @entity10			1
that hordes of @entity12 and @entity14 @entity13 are mourning the 44 - year - old actress , who starred in more than a dozen telenovelas , is no surprise to anyone who understands the deep hold that these soap operas have on the imagination of @entity23 culture			1
in fact , for @entity13 to fully grasp the culture of the more than 51 million @entity12 who live in the @entity13 , as well as their @entity27 - speaking brethren south of the border and in the @entity27 - speaking @entity30 islands , they would do well to understand the importance of the telenovela			1
telenovelas are such an integral part of @entity23 tradition , in the @entity13 and in the @entity27 - speaking world , that soap stars like @entity2 become part a household 's extended family			1
fans follow the stars ' lives on and off the screen and live vicariously through both their fictional characters and real lives			2
they are something like the @entity49 of @entity23 culture			1
what 's more , social media has given fans access to their beloved celebrities 24 - 7 , which may explain the outpouring of grief when news broke that @entity2 succumbed to breast cancer that had spread to her liver			1
it was , after all , like losing a family member			0
since her debut in the @entity3 soap " @entity63 , " where she played opposite her biological sister , @entity64 , @entity2 had been a beloved member of @entity3 households			1
among the soaps she went on to star in were the sequel , " @entity68 , " " @entity69 , " " @entity70 , " " @entity71 , " and her latest , filmed in @entity4 , where she lived , the @entity73 series " @entity74			2
" @entity2 , however , was best known for her role as @entity76 in the deliciously sexy soap " @entity78			2
" the story revolved around a young woman who falls in love with a 67 - year old man , played by the legendary @entity3 - @entity84 actor @entity83			0
in the show , he dies and comes back to life as a young stud , @entity89			0
in the nightly ritual of telenovela watching for millions of @entity12 , such fantasy plots are exactly the point			2
after a hard day 's work , they are the balm or the dirty martini -- the inexpensive reward and gift -- that @entity23 women offer themselves			2
one reason why ? for immigrants , many of them laboring in a new land -- cleaning , cooking for others , slaughtering cows in meat houses , running their own businesses , for instance -- the novelas represent a shared escape , a way to stay connected with loved ones back home and to each other , here in @entity13			1
they run on fast - paced cycles and feature a roller coaster of emotions and plot twists that fans savor until it all ends a few months later			0
one veteran actress described it to a reporter this way : " ... cry			0
in this one you do n't cry			0
" the popularity of novelas helped @entity132 edge out @entity133 in several sweeps months , making the spanish - language network the no. 4 network among adults 18 - 49			2
audience share is a testament of the growth of the @entity23 population in the @entity13 , but it could also indicate a dearth of shows targeting this demographic in english - language networks			1
indeed , while the @entity13 soap opera genre has continued to decline in viewership , @entity23 soaps have surged , partly because they have kept up with the times			1
while 30 years ago most story lines featured sappy @entity152 - like plots -- poor girl meets rich guy , falls in love and , after a series of tragedies , ends up with her prince -- they have evolved			0
plots , twists and characters wink to issues of the day , and in many ways the shows serve as surrogate teachers , where taboos are explored and often debunked			0
characters are getting divorces , remarrying , having premarital sex , cheating , having abortions , killing and getting killed			0
they are not just the good girls anymore -- they are naughty , and they 're winning , too			0
but perhaps the most delightful difference between @entity13 soaps and @entity27 novelas is not just how over the top , fashionable and gorgeous the stars are ; it is also that when they end after several months , evil is taken out , good always wins , and there is , for the most part , a happy ending			1
a refreshing way to live in a country where people want to deport you and your family ! in some ways , @entity2 was a standard bearer for the telenovela			1
she may not have had a happy ending the way many of her on - screen characters did , but she lived her life like many of the women she played on the small screen : valiantly fighting cancer , divorcing , falling in love again and adopting a baby girl			0
she had more than a quarter - million @entity204 followers and celebrated her 44th birthday with them in her final days			0
in her last tweet on february 10 , she thanked her fans : " @entity209			0
