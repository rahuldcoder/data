-- the order was to be followed immediately			0
the entire school was to be put on lockdown			0
students , teachers and even administrators were to stay inside ; no excuses , no exceptions			0
the place ; a small mining town in northern @entity11 called @entity12			1
inside the classrooms , dozens of puzzled high school students were quietly wondering , if they were in danger			0
i was one of those students			0
@entity12 , in the state of @entity19 , just south of @entity20 , was back then a quiet town where one could leave doors unlocked without fear			0
as class president , i felt it was my obligation and duty to my fellow students to find out what was happening			0
leading a group of about a half dozen of my classmates , we ventured out , with the acquiescence of our history teacher			0
as we approached the school 's front gate , we heard what sounded like a sizable group of people chanting			2
the gate was padlocked , so we did what rambunctious children would do in that kind of situation : we jumped over the fence			0
we walked slowly towards the crowd surrounding a man who appeared to be their leader			2
he was a balding , chubby man in his 50s with white hair and beard			2
" thanks for coming out to welcome me , " he told me as he shook my hand			0
" you 're welcome , " i replied , probably with a blank stare			0
i had no idea who the man was			2
i later learned that his name was @entity65			0
in that presidential election year , the then - 53 - year - old businessman was running for the highest office in the country as the opposition candidate with the @entity71 , the @entity71			1
until then , the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) had ruled @entity11 with an iron fist for nearly 60 years and it would remain in power for another 12			1
the party , formed in the wake of the bloody @entity11 revolution that ended in 1917 , had forged allegiances with unions , business sectors and power brokers so effectively that virtually no one in the country could move a finger without the @entity72 's blessing			1
indeed , the outgoing president selected his successor through a practice known as " @entity88 , " roughly meaning " the finger point			0
" for all practical purposes , the @entity11 media was back then the government 's propaganda arm			1
@entity65 had to leave my town only a few hours after his arrival			0
no hotel would allow him to stay there			0
no restaurant would serve him and his people			0
no business wanted anything to do with him or any opposition party			2
doing so would have meant financial ruin or banishment			0
fear in those days was highly contagious			0
that year in july , @entity107 , the @entity72 's candidate , won the presidency in one of the most controversial elections in @entity11 history			1
some @entity11 historians still claim that another opposition candidate , @entity113 from the @entity114 ( the @entity114 ) , was the real winner of those elections			1
@entity65 died a year later in a car crash in his home state of @entity118			0
i 've been thinking a lot about that time in my life growing up in @entity11 , especially as the country is getting ready to inaugurate a new president saturday			1
much has changed since then			2
electoral reforms brought about during the 1990s opened up democracy in @entity11			1
@entity65 's party , the @entity71 , finally came to power in 2000 when @entity128 won the elections			1
it was the first time in 71 years that @entity11 was going to be governed by a party that was not the @entity72			1
@entity132 was succeeded by the @entity71 's @entity133 , who finished his six - year term saturday			1
i was in @entity11 this july as a @entity0 correspondent covering this year 's presidential elections and , as far as i could see , the process was fair and transparent			1
i went to multiple polling places around @entity139			0
@entity11 were voting openly and without fear			1
the ghosts of the past , including manipulation , coercion , threats and " pregnant " ballot boxes ( those already filled with votes ) , seemed missing			0
and so @entity148 , a charismatic attorney and former governor of @entity11 state , the most populous state in the country and adjacent to @entity139 , won the election this year			1
he only garnered 38 % of the vote , less than the combined total of his three opponents , but that 's the way elections work sometimes			2
as far as i and an army of international observers and journalists could see , he 's the legitimate winner			2
his victory is historically significant because for the first time in 12 years the @entity72 is back in power			1
many in @entity11 wonder if @entity148 is the new face of an old party			1
will he try to forge the same alliances of the past ? will he use unions as coercion arms as the @entity72 's political machine did in the past ? the good news is that , as i said before , much has changed in @entity11			1
there was no social media in 1988			0
today 's media , as irresponsible and sensationalist as it can be sometimes , is not driven by the government 's agenda			2
@entity182 , rather than fear , was the driving factor as @entity11 went to the polls this year			1
the bad news is that much in @entity11 has n't changed since 1988			1
corrupt union leaders remain as powerful as they were back then , if not more			2
abject poverty makes millions of young people vulnerable to organized crime			0
and national industries that used to be controlled by the federal government , i.e. , the @entity72 , are now crippling monopolies that inhibit competition and keep prices artificially inflated			2
@entity148 's six - year presidency is an opportunity for him and a second chance for his party to take @entity11 to the next level			1
will @entity11 remain the country of untapped potential , being almost there , but never quite joining the @entity204 ? or will @entity148 and his party capitalize on this historic opportunity to break with old habits of the past for the benefit of the country ? only manana will tell .			1

@entity148 presidential victory in @entity11 is a return to an old , once - corrupt party
the @entity72 says it has changed even though its old tools of corruption remain
as @entity148 is inaugurated many are asking : is he a new man or just a new face ?
success may be *measured* in his ability to tap @entity11 's potential
