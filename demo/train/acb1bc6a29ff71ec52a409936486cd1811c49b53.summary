for many kids living in rural and non-electrified parts of @entity3 , the final school bell does n't just signal the end of another day of learning			1
instead , it also means the beginning of an arduous trek through busy and dangerous roads to get back home in time to complete their homework before sunset			2
for @entity16 , this was all too familiar			1
she saw it every day in her hometown of @entity20 , a mining community in the @entity22 of @entity3			1
so the young entrepreneur decided to do something about it			0
" this is our home			0
the reason we started this business is we looked at our community and we wanted to do work that matters , " explains @entity16			1
that work turned into @entity33 -- the first green initiative from @entity35 , a social startup @entity16 co-founded alongside childhood friend - turned - business partner @entity37			1
the millennial pair -- aged just 21 and 22 years old respectively -- are taking advantage of the plastic waste in their region , upcycling it into 100 % recycled plastic schoolbags for local disadvantaged students			1
but here 's the twist -- the bag also doubles as a light			2
the backpacks feature a solar panel in the flap -- which charges as the children walk to school -- as well as strips of reflective material , an added safety design to make the children more visible to traffic in the early hours			1
a bright idea " one of the first obstacles these kids face is not being able to finish their homework , " says @entity16 , the first runner - up at the 2014 @entity61 , a pan-african award celebrating entrepreneurs aged 15 - 22 who 've come up with innovative ways to solve problems in their communities			1
" if a child does n't have access to light then as soon as the sun goes down there is not time to do anything but sleep			0
" @entity16 explains the design is to help poor households from using up candles which might otherwise have lasted an entire week			1
and the children can focus on their homework without worrying about disrupting the family dynamic			0
" a child simply does not have the luxury of burning the midnight oil and practicing their math sums until 12 o'clock at night because [ the family ] have one candle which was meant to be rationed for the whole week			0
" after a six - month pilot phase earlier this year , the resourceful entrepreneurs are now distributing their 100 % upcycled plastic bags to schools they 've identified around their howetown of @entity20			1
the company has also teamed up with local individuals and corporates who are willing to cover the cost of the bags on behalf of the students			0
depending on their donation , these so - called " giving partners " typically matched to a class , a grade or a school			1
overcoming challenges launched last year , @entity33 has grown to today employ eight full - time staff -- six of which are women -- while its workshop produces around 20 bags a day			2
yet , running such a business has n't been without challenges			0
@entity16 says there was a fair few failures in the beginning -- especially around training staff			1
another problem the two young businesswomen faced early on was the lack of infrastructure for plastic recycling			2
but instead of letting this become a setback , the pair went about creating it themselves			0
" we get [ plastic ] from landfill sites and collect it from schools that have come on board as " purpose textile banks " and local schools run campaigns to get students to bring in plastic to be upcycled , " @entity16 explains			1
" the plastic comes to our workshop where we process them into a textile , sew it up with industrial sewing machines and then we distribute , " she continues			2
" seeing the kids believe that you can have waste and rubbish ... [ that can be turned into ] so much more -- you get kids being interested in recycling , whereas before you 're in a rural area the concept of upcycling is a foreign concept			0
" but when it comes in the form of a tangible product that helps you out -- now kids are picking up litter around the community , " she adds			0
new year , new products looking ahead , the two have big plans for the future			0
@entity16 says they are already hard at work as they prepare to take on an additional 12 employees to meet the growing demand for their bags , as well as introduce new products			1
she says : " we 've gotten a huge interest from other countries across @entity3			2
we 've also started with product development -- having other things for sale like conscience bags made out of the same material that corporates can then buy for their conferences and summits			0
" we 've also started development with a luxury brand to develop things like clutches			0
as part of the proceeds of the sales , we 'll be able to finance and subsidize these bags			0
