" it appeared that he fainted			2
" a doctor checked @entity13 out and he returned to the hearing room to continue , but committee chairman sen. @entity18 " overruled him , " @entity12 said			1
" looks like we will continue tomorrow			2
" @entity13 returned amid applause to the hearing room			1
on his way out of the building , @entity13 told @entity1 's @entity25 , " i 'm doing ok			1
i just got a little dehydrated			2
i ate a couple of bananas and drank some water			2
i did n't eat breakfast this morning			1
" @entity13 is the head of @entity31 , which oversees the conduct of the @entity6 wars in the @entity34 and central @entity35			1
@entity37 spokesman @entity36 said @entity13 was examined by a doctor in an outer room			1
" they gave him some fruit and juice to get his blood sugar up and did all the tests you would do in the aftermath of an unusual episode like that , " @entity36 said			0
" he took some time , is feeling better and wanted to go back out to complete the hearing			1
" president @entity52 called @entity13 from @entity53 while the president was en route back from @entity56 , @entity57 , a @entity51 spokesman said			1
@entity52 got the impression , from his talk with @entity13 , that he is " doing great , " deputy @entity51 press secretary @entity58 told reporters			1
" sounds like he was just a little dehydrated , " @entity58 said			2
a @entity37 official added that @entity13 " goes nonstop and has kept his schedule like this for nine years			1
i do n't know if it was the schedule and pace at which he drives himself contributed to this			2
he indicated he did n't have breakfast or anything to eat or drink			1
he is back at the @entity37 working			0
he did not go for further medical tests			0
" @entity12 said , " we have just returned from a weeklong overseas trip to @entity77 and @entity78 and i think he was just dehydrated			2
we are back at the @entity37 working and executing his afternoon schedule			0
" before @entity13 was escorted out , key senators questioned the progress and planning for @entity6 efforts in @entity8			1
opening the hearing , @entity18 , @entity85 , questioned the ratio of @entity6 and @entity89 troops to @entity8 troops , urging a faster ramping up of @entity8 security forces			2
" progress towards the goal of @entity8 taking the lead in operations has been unsatisfactory			0
today operations in @entity8 are excessively dependent on coalition forces , " @entity18 said			0
@entity18 said in the coming campaign in @entity99 , there is a plan to have one @entity8 service member for every two international troops			0
he called instead for a one - to - one ratio , with @entity8 forces in the lead			0
his @entity108 counterpart , sen. @entity107 , @entity109 , said in his opening remarks that the key trends were going in a " bad direction , perhaps even signaling a mounting crisis			0
" " hoping for success on the arbitrary timeline set by the administration is simply unrealistic , " @entity107 said , calling for the president to say the @entity6 will stay in @entity8 until there is success			2
moments before @entity13 ' fainting spell , @entity107 asked him about the president 's target to begin withdrawal of the additional troops by july of next year			1
" july 2011 is not the date where we race for the exits			0
it is the date where , having done an assessment , we begin a process of transition of tasks to @entity8 security forces based on conditions and begin a process of , quote , a responsible drawdown of our forces , " @entity13 explained			1
@entity107 expressed doubts about the timetable , as he has before			0
the @entity109 senator worried that people in the region will assume @entity6 is leaving and that will strengthen the hand of the @entity145			0
" you believe that we can begin a drawdown in july of 2011 , under the projected plans that we have ? " @entity107 asked			0
" that is the policy and i support it , " @entity13 said			1
" i understand you support the policy , " @entity107 responded			0
" will conditions on the ground indicate that we will begin a withdrawal , in the words of the vice president : ' july of 2011 , you 're going to see a whole lot of people moving out , bet on it ' ? " @entity107 moved on to another topic before @entity13 could answer the question			1
a few moments later , the hearing was recessed until wednesday morning			2
prepared remarks from @entity13 said progress is being made even as the security violence has gotten more intense			1
the surge of @entity6 troops into @entity8 is ahead of schedule , but the situation on the ground will get more difficult before it gets better , he warned in the prepared remarks			0
" i noted several months ago ... the going was likely to get harder before it got easier			0
that has already been the case , as we 've seen recently			0
" all 30,000 additional @entity6 troops ordered by @entity52 last year will be in place in @entity8 by the end of august , according to @entity13			1
troops had originally been scheduled to be in place by september			0
in the prepared remarks , he told the congressional panel tuesday that increasing the size and capability of the struggling @entity186 and police forces are back on track , but there is more work to be done			0
@entity192 @entity191 also argued that progress has been made			0
" we are regaining the initiative and the insurgency is beginning to lose momentum , " she said in her opening statement , but noted the outcome is " far from determined			0
