editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is broadband television network of @entity5			0
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- set beside the @entity22 in southeastern @entity23 , the @entity21 area was supposed to be @entity25 's answer to the @entity26 back in the ' 50s			1
but its developers failed to anticipate the raw sewage that would run up the @entity31 from @entity32 and make survival impossible for many aquatic species			2
rotting fish guts and toxic debris soon littered the shoreline			1
construction projects were abandoned and yet another impotent vision of luxury tourism was left flaccid			1
thanks again , trash ! see the rest of @entity43 : @entity22 at @entity9 today the entire @entity22 is an apocalyptic dustbowl in the center of the @entity23 badlands			1
we set out to explore this fetid bouillabaisse			1
what we found were remnants of the @entity51 , a half - million - acre plot that was once the practice site for various governmental bombardiers			0
it is the place of business for the residents of a nearby compound known as @entity58 -- a mostly insane coterie of fun - hunting drifters , vets , addicts , artists and crazies who subsist on saut√©ed snake , lukewarm @entity67 , money earned from scrapping bombshell fragments and what 's left of their wits			0
it 's pretty much all that remains of the @entity75 .			0

a vision of luxury in the *1950s* , @entity23 " @entity26 " is now a " fetid bouillabaisse "
developers did *n't* foresee *pollution* that has *killed* millions of fish in the @entity21
*squatters* , toxic debris and " apocalyptic " *landscape* are all that remain today
