-- it seems that all anyone is talking about lately is the economy , so why is money still such a tough topic to discuss with your nearest and dearest ? they say married couples fight over money more than anything else , but what about when you just started dating ? that 's possibly even more awkward			2
columnist says no woman should leave her house on first date without enough money to pay for her meal			1
the first date though @entity23 feels otherwise , my take on this has always been he ( or she ) who asks , pays			1
( the bloviating shrink says men should always be the ones to pony up			0
) and if you do n't pay for the whole thing , you should at least offer to split the tab			1
incredibly ( to me ) , most women i spoke to thought i was an idiot and firmly believed the dude should always pay on a first date -- though for some this was a recent change of heart			1
@entity39 , a 33 - year - old writer told me , " i tend to try to pay for myself , but as i get older and more comfortable with my awesomeness , i kind of wish and hope that the other person will be a little more old - fashioned about it			1
if someone 's eating opposite @entity48 , should n't she or he pay for the privilege ? after all , i 'm entertaining and cute and if you let me order dessert there may be some smooching in your future			2
regardless of your feelings on the matter , whatever you do , do n't leave the house without enough money to pay for at least your share			2
it 's a first date so while he may seem great ( and generous ) on paper , you never really know what you 're getting into until he 's sitting across from you			0
sure , he might be staring adoringly deep into your eyes , but then again , his pants might be held up with duct tape			0
do you really want to count on that dude to know the meaning of " gratuity ? " what to say : " that 's so generous of you -- can i at least leave the tip ? " what not to say : " this princess does n't pay for food ! " dates two - thru - six @entity78 , ceo and founder of @entity80 , has built a business on bad dating behavior			1
she explains her thoughts on the money issue : " while it 's not expected , let 's face it -- we are hardwired to want the man to ' bring back dinner to the cave			1
' " up until my current relationship , i 've almost always been in the driver 's seat finance-wise ( and believe me , that 's a pretty meager seat ) so i 've always furnished my own cave			0
i ask her if it 's okay to date a guy just for a free ride or free grub ? @entity102 says no. " being cheap is never attractive and i would say that after more than four dates the woman should pay the tip. " whoa ! just the tip ? apparently the women who called me a moron were onto something ! however , if you 're going to keep riding the free - food express , the least you can do is surreptitiously feel out his money situation -- if he 's hurting , suggest cheaper restaurants or maybe cook for the guy			1
what to say : " that 's so generous of you -- can i at least leave the tip ? " what not to say : " let 's have the 2000 @entity123 , since this one 's on you ! " dates six - thru - infinity up until the two of you really get to know each other , there 's probably not going to be any urgent need to discuss finances in depth , but he ca n't keep buying you steak and foie gras dinners if he 's on a cheeseburger and fries budget			0
for all you know , you 're out - earning him or he 's supporting 12 @entity139 orphans and is stretched to the breaking point			0
then again , maybe he 's a gazillionaire			0
at about date six ( possibly sooner if they 're really eventful dates ! ) , you should be getting to know a lot about every part of him -- including his wallet			2
there 's no right or wrong way to approach this discussion , but just remember , financial compatibility is almost as important as sexual chemistry , though rarely as much fun			0

columnist : whoever issues *invite* on first date should pay for dinner
says many women , *dr.* @entity23 *disagree* with her
writer says if guy is paying for dinner , women should offer to split the tab
by date six , woman should know his financial situation -- and who should pay
