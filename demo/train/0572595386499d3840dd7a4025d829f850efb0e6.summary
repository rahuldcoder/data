-- the @entity1 is looking for new ways to regain its strength , to shake off the recession blues and fortify its position of international leadership			1
but @entity9 is missing the obvious , neglecting its closest neighbors			0
with @entity14 's @entity13 partners struggling , with @entity16 's economy powering ahead , and the @entity17 simmering with uncertainty , @entity9 has decided to " pivot " from its decade - long post- 9/11 wars and look to @entity21 and the @entity22			1
but the @entity1 is overlooking the most logical , natural place to build strong friendships , partnerships and alliances : @entity14			1
in recent years , attention focused on two places			0
first , the perennial center of global turmoil , the greater @entity17 shook under armed conflict and ideological clashes , with major wars in @entity34 and @entity35 happening simultaneously with an escalating confrontation between @entity37 and the @entity38 over @entity40 's nuclear program			2
at the same time , nervous attention turned to @entity16 , whose dazzling growth propelled a once - minor economy into the world 's second largest in a few short years , making it clear that the @entity16 - @entity1 rivalry will become one of the dominant features of this century			1
but while @entity9 paid little attention , something rather spectacular happened to the south , in @entity14			1
a region that had become a caricature of itself -- the place that gave us words such as junta and banana republic -- attained a new level of political and economic maturity			0
most countries found a workable economic formula , addressing poverty without repelling investors			0
in most nations , democracy grew strong roots			0
not everybody ignored the @entity14 miracle			2
@entity16 and @entity37 , the two countries the @entity38 most worries about , have been busy developing diplomatic relations and increasing economic ties			1
during years when the @entity1 paid little mind to relations with @entity14 , home to 600 million people with economies worth $ 5 trillion , @entity79 and @entity40 set their sights on the @entity14 hemisphere			1
@entity79 engaged in an aggressive economic push , becoming a top customer for @entity14 natural resources , loaning billions , developing infrastructure and building trade ties			1
and @entity37 found in @entity14 a way to dodge @entity89 economic sanctions and break its diplomatic isolation			2
in the last few years , @entity40 has opened new embassies in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			0
in addition , it is opening @entity37 cultural centers in 17 countries in the region			0
political and economic ties are blossoming , while @entity9 pays little attention			0
and this is happening just as @entity14 has developed in a direction that could make it easier to build ties with the @entity1			1
most people in the continent live in democracies , having strongly rejected the right of the military to seize power and rule by force			0
most latin countries now have free market economies that seek , with some success , to raise the bottom for the millions who still live in poverty			0
@entity14 and the @entity1 have much in common			1
with the exception of @entity123 , @entity124 , and two or three @entity124 acolytes , the hemisphere , including the @entity1 , is made up of countries that share easily compatible ideologies			1
with 50 million people of @entity132 heritage living in the @entity1 , personal ties also help create a steady foundation for a more powerful hemispheric alliance			1
to be sure , not every country has seen stronger democratic and economic growth in recent years			0
@entity124 has seen its economy falter and its president , @entity139 , has amassed a dramatic concentration of power			0
that model , in which the president grows so powerful that it undermines democratic institutions , has been imitated to different degrees in @entity95 , @entity97 and @entity96			0
but the model embraced with the greatest enthusiasm is unabashedly democratic , market - friendly , with a social conscience , as seen in @entity151			2
the results have been spectacular			0
@entity16 wows the world with double - digit economic growth , but @entity151 has suddenly become the world 's seventh largest economy , on its way to displace the @entity158 as the sixth			1
@entity151 's @entity160 grew 7.5 % last year			1
@entity161 's soared 9.2 %			0
others expanded just as fast			0
@entity163 's gdp climbed a stunning 15 % and @entity94 's more than 8 %			0
much of that came from trade with @entity16			2
and if @entity16 's economy falls into recession , @entity14 will hurt			1
but @entity14 economies are pulling tens of millions out of poverty and into the middle class			2
that means they are becoming consumers who could keep the economy moving even if trade falters			0
in a region where the @entity1 has long been the unrivaled principal trading partner , trade with @entity16 is exploding , totaling $ 180 billion last year , up 160 % since 2006			1
suddenly , @entity16 has become @entity151 's main commercial partner , topping the @entity1			1
just when it most urgently needs to regain its footing , the @entity1 is ceding ground through neglect , missing out on the chance to expand markets in a way that could benefit the @entity1 and @entity14 , and losing diplomatic and political ground when it can least afford it			1
@entity9 will inevitably continue to focus on the @entity17			0
and @entity21 will surely garner growing attention			2
but neglecting @entity14 is simply foolish			2
the @entity1 is overlooking a natural alliance			1
a respectful partnership , not one where one country dictates to others , could help the @entity1 build a stronger diplomatic presence on the global arena , help it shake the blues and get ready for the tough challenges the young century has already thrown in its path			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

@entity201 : as @entity1 starts to look to @entity21 , it overlooks the opportunities in @entity14
countries like @entity151 are booming economically and have strong democracies , she says
@entity209 says others have noticed : @entity16 overtook @entity1 as @entity151 's main commercial partner
@entity209 : 50 million @entity213 in the @entity1 also create a strong , natural foundation for alliances
