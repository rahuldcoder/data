-- president @entity1 expressed hope tuesday that the @entity3 and @entity4 can arrive at a " balanced approach " to relations as he met with @entity4 prime minister @entity7 for the first time since a string of damaging episodes last year			1
the talks tuesday between the two leaders on the sidelines of a large nuclear security summit meeting in @entity15 are the highest profile meeting between the two countries since @entity19 airstrikes on november 26 killed 24 @entity4 soldiers on the @entity4 - @entity22 border			1
the deaths drove relations between @entity25 and @entity26 to a new low , coming on top of anger over the @entity3 raid that killed @entity30 at a compound in @entity4 last may , and continued @entity3 drone strikes on targets in the nation			1
the @entity4 parliament is expected this week to start debating a committee 's recommendation that the @entity3 stop drone strikes inside its territory and apologize unconditionally for the november airstrikes			1
" there have been times -- i think we should be candid -- over the last several months where those relations have had periods of strains , " @entity1 said at the start of the meeting with @entity7			1
" but i welcome the fact that the @entity50 is reviewing , after some extensive study , the nature of this relationship			0
" the @entity54 on @entity55 , a group of 18 members of parliament responsible for reviewing relations with the @entity3 , made its recommendations in a report to lawmakers last week			2
" no overt or covert operations inside @entity4 shall be tolerated , " the report said			2
@entity1 said his expectation was that as a result of the @entity4 review and discussions in the @entity3 , " that we can achieve the kind of balanced approach that respects @entity4 's sovereignty but also respects our concerns with respect to our national security and our needs to battle terrorists who have targeted us in the past			1
" @entity7 expressed appreciation that @entity1 had acknowledged the need to respect @entity4 sovereignty and said his government was committed to fighting against extremism			1
he also said it was important to maintain stability in both @entity4 and @entity22			2
beyond the meeting tuesday , there remains much work to be done to mend ties between @entity25 and @entity26			0
following the fateful border airstrikes in november , the @entity4 government shut down the two @entity19 supply routes in the country , asked the @entity3 to vacate an air base on its territory and boycotted a conference about the future of @entity22			1
the @entity4 parliamentary report on relations with the @entity3 gave an indication of the lingering discontent among @entity4 officials			1
calling on the @entity4 government to ensure that " the principles of an independent foreign policy " are observed , the report said that the @entity3 " must review its footprints in @entity4			1
" the three key points it listed in that regard were the cessation of drone strikes inside @entity4 borders , " no hot pursuit or boots on @entity4 territory , " and the need for the activities of foreign private security contractors to be " transparent and subject to @entity4 law			0
" it demanded an " unconditional apology from the @entity3 for the unprovoked incident dated 25th - 26th november 2011			0
" it also said that those responsible for the airstrikes should be brought to justice			0
when lawmakers reconvened monday , the committee 's report was on the agenda , but the speaker did not call it up for debate			0
the joint session of the parliament must decide whether to act on the recommendations			0
@entity137 , a committee member , said he expected the recommendations to be approved , but not before several days of debate			0
" we kept in mind both the angles , domestic demands and the requirement by the international community , while compiling our recommendations , " @entity137 said			0
" we were optimistic , progressive , but of course patriotic @entity4 at the end while we were compiling the recommendations			0
" an investigation into the lethal @entity19 airstrikes in november by @entity152			0
gen. @entity153 on behalf of the @entity3 concluded that @entity4 provoked @entity19 forces and that distrust between the two parties led to the firefight			1
@entity4 disputed the findings , saying @entity153 's report was factually incorrect			2
there has been a sharp drop in the number of drone attacks in @entity4 since the airstrikes			2
@entity3 officials rarely discuss the @entity167 's drone program in @entity4 , though privately they have said that the covert strikes are legal and an effective tactic in the fight against extremists			1
in january , @entity1 defended the use of drone attacks , saying a " pinpoint strike " is " less intrusive " on other countries ' sovereignty than other military ways to target @entity177			2
he gave no indication that the @entity3 policy of ordering drone strikes would change , at least as long as a terrorist threat remains			0
@entity0 's @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
