@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 has spent the last seven months being " a walking blood bank " aboard one of the the world 's largest hospital ships			1
thousands of volunteers join the massive hospital ship " @entity10 " every year			1
the 50 - year - old nurse and grandmother from the @entity13 resigned from her position in a hospital to volunteer aboard a ship that provides free medical treatment to some of the world 's poorest people			1
like any of the 450 volunteer crew members currently aboard the @entity10 , @entity3 can be called on at any time of the day to give blood , as the ship has no facilities for storing blood products			1
instead the ship operates a system where there are usually 30 donors for each blood type			1
@entity3 says she recently helped a young woman who needed an amputation			0
" this young woman required a below - the - knee amputation , but was very weak so i was called in to give her blood as our blood groups matched , " she told @entity2			2
" it was an amazing experience because two minutes after giving my blood , i saw it go straight into her arm			2
in the @entity13 you have no idea what happens with your blood , " she added			2
the " @entity10 , " currently docked off the coast of @entity48 , @entity49 , also operates as a floating hospital with medical facilities including six state - of - the - art operating theaters , an ophthalmic unit , two ct scanners and 78 hospital beds onboard			1
the @entity58 charity began in 1978 and since then has been credited with providing medical services valued at $ 748 million , performing more than 41,000 operations and impacting approximately two million people			2
@entity10 ships ceo @entity62 says the charity has been able to help so many people through what he calls a " unique business model			1
" thousands of volunteers join the ship every year , and they not only do it for free but also have to pay for accommodation aboard the vessels ; some like @entity3 , pay around $ 600 a month			1
see more images of volunteers onboard the ship Â» " this allows almost all our resources to go into state - of - the - art medical facilities , " @entity62 told @entity2			1
it costs about $ 1.25 million every month to maintain , has three wards and a small intensive care unit operated by top surgeons from around the world			2
would you give up your holiday to volunteer on the hospital ship ? sound off below one of them is dr. @entity88 , a @entity89 surgeon and one of the short - term volunteers			1
@entity88 is currently on board for three weeks , time he took off instead of going on holiday with his family			0
" it 's a wonderful thing to do , a great humanitarian gesture , " @entity88 told @entity2			2
" there is tremendous need here , as these countries are very poor and have very few resources of any kind			0
" he described a recent surgery he performed on a 14 - year - old boy with a benign but " extremely aggressive tumor " that had " invaded " almost the whole of the young man 's face , leaving him completely disfigured			1
following successful surgery to remove the tumor , the boy was given a more " acceptable appearance , " @entity88 said			2
the charity behind " @entity10 " was founded by @entity112 - based @entity111 and his wife @entity113			1
the couple took out a bank loan in 1978 and purchased a retired luxury ocean liner for $ 1 million			0
their dream was to create a modern , mobile hospital that would provide free surgery and treatment to the world 's poorest people			1
in 1982 she sailed to @entity49 with 350 crew and a new name , the " @entity127			1
" she was the first of five ships that have served in more than 150 ports in developing nations around the world			1
last month , the @entity111 and @entity132 were presented with the @entity133 from @entity134 , the international children 's charity for their 30 - year commitment to treating the world 's poor			1
@entity111 said the idea came after he stayed on a tropical island , and a storm occurred			0
" there was a hurricane , and i heard that one of the girls had prayed for a ship to come with everything that was needed to clear up the storm damage , " @entity111 told @entity2			0
" it was like a laser beam going off			0
i could n't get the idea out of my mind and i knew it was what i wanted to do			0
" in addition to complicated surgeries , @entity58 also trains local medical professionals in modern health care techniques			0
the charity also develops construction and agriculture projects			0
" we then hope the countries ' health care systems can be better off after we leave for the next country , " @entity111 said			0
finding that next country takes a lot of research and coordination with local governments and diplomacy			0
in 2010 the ship will go to @entity171 , then @entity172			0
@entity58 is also planning to go to the @entity173			0
" we need approval from the local governments and safety is also important			0
fortunately , @entity58 has a very good reputation , particularly in @entity49 , " explained ceo @entity62			2
" people know that we 're here to help , regardless of race , religion and political affiliation			0
