with its pristine beaches , warm water and coral reefs , @entity0 has long been a must - visit destination for jet - setters from all over the world			1
they come from @entity10 , the @entity11 and @entity12 to unwind in the sun. but not all the hosts can afford to be so relaxed			0
the country , which is made up of 115 islands , will host 215,000 international tourists this year , and these visitors will contribute 21.7 % of its gross domestic product			1
indeed , the @entity20 says @entity0 ' economy is " highly dependent " on tourism			1
capitalizing on the nation 's natural beauty , and making this sector a success , is crucial if the country wants to retain the top spot in @entity30 human development rankings			2
decline in visitors as the global financial crisis of 2008 stopped many people from taking holidays , the @entity0 was hit hard			1
that year , the country 's gdp contracted by 2.1 %			2
tourism contributed close to 30 % of @entity35 in 2008 , but by 2010 that number was closer to 25 %			1
since then numbers have continued to fall			2
another reason for this decline , according to @entity42 , is competition from @entity44 , which ended a violent civil war in 2010			2
the research group says visitors to @entity44 are from the " same demographic as those who travel to the @entity0 " and the substitution has had an impact			1
in addition to these issues , the country has had to deal with the failure of the state - owned national airline			0
@entity57 recorded a loss of $ 12.5 million in 2010/11 and the company made massive cuts			1
things got so bad that in january 2012 the national airline flew fewer passengers from the country 's biggest airport than @entity65			0
industry revival it was this situation that led the @entity69 airline @entity68 to offer $ 20 million for a 40 % stake in the company			1
the @entity0 government matched the investment and retained 60 %			1
the cash injection and corporate reorganization that followed helped turn the company around			0
" the partnership with @entity68 has allowed the airline to reorganize itself , restructure itself and allowed us to get to where we are today , " says ceo of @entity57 @entity78			1
" it 's a win for @entity57 in the sense that it helps us to grow our network ... [ it ] helps people being trained and developed			1
" and the latest numbers show the partnership has paid off			2
in 2013 , almost 200,000 people embarked on an @entity57 flight overseas -- twice the number from the previous year			1
as well as this boost , the government embarked on an aggressive re-branding exercise to appeal to holidaymakers on a budget			0
the @entity96 now forecasts gdp growth to be " above 3.5 % in 2014 and 2015 due largely to a rebound in the tourism sector			1
" given the country grew at 2.8 % in 2012 , there is some proof things are improving			2
and this trend is also recognized by the @entity105 , who say the country has " excellent " prospects when it comes to travel and tourism			2
@entity111 , ceo of the private sector body says " [ the @entity0 ] has been affected in the last few years by the recession in @entity10 but ... the contribution from the sector to the @entity0 economy is forecast to rise by 4.3 % every year over the next decade			1
" @entity118 investments as well as the tourism sector , money from the @entity11 has also gone into the country 's infrastructure			2
in 2011 , the @entity123 opened , bringing the first @entity125 and ct scans to the island			0
but the benefits of the center go beyond health			0
" the second floor is almost entirely dedicated to teaching and learning , " the minister of health explained during a speech to open the center			0
" indeed , it has been designed with continuous professional education in mind			0
" and the @entity69 has also funded eight wind turbines which whirr above the capital , @entity141 , and also two diesel powered generators			1
these power sources supply roughly a quarter of the country 's energy -- crucial for hotels , bars and restaurants which keep tourists coming back			0
" investment from the @entity69 and other countries as well has been instrumental in turning around the economy , " says president @entity151 who was reelected in 2011 with a 55 % majority			1
" over the last five years we 've seen $ 1.5 billion in investment from mainly the @entity69 , @entity158 and @entity159			1
" indeed , @entity159 is becoming an increasingly important source of visitors to the archipelago			0
figures from the @entity164 show that visitor arrivals in @entity0 are up by over 90 % compared to last year			1
courting controversy but as well as benefits , foreign investment has also brought controversy to the sleepy island chain			0
" the @entity173 come in and basically they want to take over , " says @entity171 , the leader of one the main opposition parties			0
" when you look at it at face value it appears to be good investment ... when you balance things out to see what he got from us and what he brought in			0
if he would have been made to pay the necessary taxes we probably would have earned more			0
" the " he " @entity171 refers to is @entity187 the president of the @entity69 , who happens to own a mansion with a billion - dollar view -- just one example of the high - profile @entity69 presence			2
but president @entity151 has rejected complaints that preferential treatment was given to those willing to spend big bucks			0
" if anyone comes here whether it is from the @entity65 or from @entity202 , @entity10 or @entity159 , the same rules will apply			0
" more from @entity203 read this : creating a new @entity205 through design read this : @entity208 : from warzone to holiday paradise @entity211 contributed to this story			0
