@entity0 -- counsel for international economist @entity3 , who is jailed on sexual assault charges , filed a new appeal on wednesday seeking his release on bail from @entity8			1
" we respectfully submit that the following bail conditions ... eliminate any concern that mr. @entity3 would or could leave this court 's jurisdiction , " wrote lawyer @entity9			1
he then said the @entity16 chief had agreed to post $ 1 million in cash , to be confined to home detention in @entity19 with electronic monitoring , and to turn over his @entity22 travel document			1
the appeal noted that the @entity24 has already surrendered his passport			0
a source close to the @entity3 defense told @entity1 's @entity28 that a deal is in the works that could result in his being freed on bail as early as thursday			1
the deal is tentative and could still fall through , but the defense was optimistic that @entity3 could be released soon			1
@entity3 's bail appeal to the state @entity35 will be heard thursday			1
it adds conditions that were not in the appeal turned down monday by a criminal court judge and describes the accused as " a loving husband and father , and a highly regarded international diplomat , lawyer , politician , economist and professor , with no prior criminal record			0
" it notes that he has been married for more than a decade and has four children from a prior marriage , one of whom lives in @entity0 , where she is a graduate student at @entity55			0
the case has captured worldwide attention			0
@entity3 is not only head of the @entity16 , but had been considered the @entity60 's best hope to unseat president @entity61 in next year 's elections			1
he is accused of sexual assault and the attempted rape of a 32 - year - old @entity66 maid in his @entity68 hotel suite			0
prosecutors have opposed his release , asserting he is a flight risk			2
meanwhile , the alleged victim was to testify wednesday before a grand jury in @entity75 , according to her attorney			1
" i want her to feel safe , " said @entity77			0
" to the extent that his freedom would impair her feeling of safety , that would deeply concern me			1
" the woman , a widow who lives with her child in @entity0 's borough of the @entity89 , will deny the claim that the incident was consensual , @entity77 said			2
she has worked at the hotel for three years and is considered a good employee , the managing director of @entity68 said in a statement			0
" her world has been turned upside down , " her attorney , @entity77 , said			0
" she is very scared about her future			0
" prosecutors allege that a naked @entity3 , 62 , chased the housekeeping employee through his @entity19 hotel suite on saturday and sexually assaulted her			2
but attorney @entity103 said during @entity3 's arraignment monday that was not the case			1
" the forensic evidence , we believe , will not be consistent with a forcible account , and we believe there is a very , very defensible case , " he said			0
the @entity16 chief faces an array of charges , including two counts of first - degree criminal sexual act , one count of first - degree attempted rape , one count of first - degree sexual abuse , one count of second - degree unlawful imprisonment , one count of forcible touching and one count of third - degree sexual abuse			2
" he grabbed the victim 's chest without consent , attempted to remove her pantyhose " and forcibly grabbed her between her legs , the complaint against @entity3 says			1
he also forced her to perform oral sex on him , assistant district attorney @entity136 said at the arraignment			0
@entity3 allegedly committed the offenses at noon , checked out of the hotel at 12:28 p.m. and went to a previously scheduled lunch about 12:45 p.m. , according to a document supporting his motion to approve bail			1
the lunch was with his daughter , according to a source with knowledge of the case			0
after lunch , he was driven to @entity152 and boarded an @entity154 flight that was scheduled to depart at 4:45 p.m. , the bail document says			0
it adds that he had bought the ticket the week before			0
as @entity3 sat in a first - class seat awaiting takeoff and a planned meeting the next day with @entity164 chancellor @entity163 in @entity165 , followed by a meeting with @entity168 finance ministers on monday in @entity169 , his world of luxury and power came crashing down			2
police , alerted by hotel staff to the maid 's accusations , ordered him off the plane and placed him in custody			0
the law enforcement source said @entity3 was examined for scratches and dna samples were taken , and investigators searched for other evidence in the suite , including possible bodily fluids from both individuals			2
@entity3 consented to the testing after investigators were prepared to execute a search warrant , the source said			2
forensic test results could be ready as soon as @entity3 's friday court appearance			1
last month , @entity3 discussed the possibility that a woman might falsely accuse him of attacking her			2
in an april 28 interview with the @entity24 daily newspaper @entity194 , he imagined " a woman who would be raped in a parking lot and who would then be promised 500,000 or a million euros to invent such a story , " the paper reported in an article published monday			0
speaking to the paper about suggestions he could become @entity24 's @entity60 candidate for president , @entity3 discussed " the long -- too long from his point of view -- campaign to come and the difficulties he will have to overcome , " the paper reported			1
" he sees three in the following order : ' money , women and my jewishness			0
' " he added , " yes , i love women ... so what ? for years they have been talking about photos of massive orgies , but i have not seen anything			0
... why do n't they show them ! " at @entity0 's @entity8 jail complex , @entity3 was placed on suicide watch , a routine procedure in such high - profile cases , two sources with direct knowledge of the case told @entity1			1
analysts suggest his career and political future are now in jeopardy , if not already dead			0
" i do not see how he can perform his duties as director of the @entity16 , " @entity233 , secretary - general of @entity24 's ruling @entity235 party , told reporters wednesday			1
" so , by definition , this issue should be resolved in the coming days			0
" the comments came a day after @entity244 treasury secretary @entity243 said @entity3 is " obviously not in a position to run the @entity16 , " and @entity246 's finance minister @entity245 said , " he should think about whether he is damaging the institution , " and consider stepping down			1
a former @entity24 finance minister , national legislator and economics professor in @entity252 , @entity3 became the @entity16 's 10th managing director in november 2007			1
while the top job at the @entity256 is customarily held by an @entity244 , the @entity16 chief is traditionally @entity168			2
but as pressure mounts over @entity3 's possible resignation , there appears growing sentiment among developing nations to buck the trend			1
@entity266 finance minister @entity265 said that succession should be based " on merit " and the position " should be considered ( among ) candidates from emerging countries , " @entity264 's official news agency reported wednesday			0
@entity273 's finance minister , @entity272 , said a new @entity16 chief should come from a developing nation , " we need to have an inclusive system , " said @entity276 , a @entity277 at the @entity278 and former chief economist at the @entity280 " the @entity283 needs to include the emerging markets and encourage merit based leadership , " he said			1
" we need an inclusive system , otherwise we 're not going to have a structure that can manage the planet and implement a fair and legitimate system of global guidance			0
" @entity276 suggested the scandal is an opportunity to change the unofficial policy , but others like @entity164 government spokesman @entity296 said the institution 's leadership should remain @entity168			2
in @entity3 's absence , first deputy managing director @entity299 has been named acting managing director , " and the fund continues its normal work , " said @entity16 spokesman @entity304			1
according to a poll released wednesday by the @entity307 ( @entity308 ) , 57 % of @entity24 people think @entity3 was victimized			2
still , 54 % said they think @entity3 's @entity60 can win in the 2012 presidential race without him			1
@entity1 's @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 and @entity320 contributed to this report .			0
