-- @entity1 may be turning the world 's hottest chili into a weapon , but there are people who actually want to eat the ghost chili -- the bhut jolokia or naga jolokia -- for fun			1
" as soon as something is declared and proven to be the hottest chili pepper in the world , everybody wants to grow it , " said @entity11 , the author of more than 35 books on chilis , including " the @entity14			1
" " so they can take people out in their yard and say , ' that is the hottest chili pepper in the world			1
do you dare eat it ? ' " a small but dedicated group of chili pepper lovers fosters its devotion to heat on web sites and at festivals nationwide			1
they gather at annual events such as the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , an autumn affair that features a pepper - eating contest , naturally , but also a song contest and excursions into the fields where fans can see how their favorite peppers are grown			1
in their homes , fans congregate for " hotlucks , " the traditional potluck with exponentially higher heat			2
@entity49 of @entity50 , @entity51 , is among these self - proclaimed " chili - heads			1
" " the main issue is flavor , " @entity49 said			0
" it 's not a pissing contest to see who can eat the hottest thing , which is usually what you see when the media reports on the stuff			0
" once an eater gets used to the heat , he or she begins to appreciate the flavor differences of each varietal , @entity49 says			2
" you basically build up a tolerance to the heat and then can taste all the flavors that are underneath it , so that what was just basically flavorless blazing heat , after a while , you can actually taste the different flavors in different chilis in different foods , " he said			1
@entity49 says he began eating chilis in the early 1990s when he needed to lose weight			0
" i wanted something that i could snack on that was pretty low - calorie but definitely let me know that i had eaten something , and chilis kind of fit the bill			2
" @entity86 has been selling hot sauces for 17 years through his company , @entity88 , and says it 's the hottest sauces that are his best sellers			0
" there are a lot of people that just want to challenge themselves , " @entity86 said			0
" they want to see what the hottest thing in the world is , either because they 're daredevils or because their heat tolerance is amazingly high and to get that reaction they like , they need something that 's super strong			0
" @entity86 sells two sauces made with the ghost chili , a pepper so hot it rates about 1 million on the @entity108 system			1
@entity109 comes in at around 5,000			0
the @entity1 government said last month that it planned to use the ghost pepper in a tear gas - like hand grenade aimed at fighting terrorists or rioters			1
making a weapon is " probably one of the best things you can do with them , " @entity11 said			0
the peppers get their heat from capsaicin , a chemical that the plants have developed to keep mammals from eating them ( mammals destroy the seeds in the digestion process )			2
birds , which can eat the peppers and pass the seeds through their system , are immune to the heat of capsaicin			2
the people who really like to eat the super-hot chilis probably do n't have as many capsaicin receptors in their mouths , @entity11 says			0
it 's the fiery reaction that @entity88 customers are searching for			0
@entity86 puts the ghost chili in one of his " insanity " sauces as well as in a limited - edition hot sauce he sells in a wooden coffin tied shut with caution tape			1
" this one has a great flavor but is the hottest in the world ; that 's the bottom line , right ? " he said			0
" people are n't talking about some cascabel [ chili ] or some other variety with that enthusiasm			2
