@entity1 they carried bright yellow umbrellas , chanting " i want true democracy , " as they festively made their way through @entity1 's streets			1
for the first time in more than a month , demonstrators peacefully took to the roads , many said , to make their voices heard and let their government and the world know that their fight for universal suffrage continues			2
@entity18 , 18 , one of the student leaders of the movement , was one familiar face in the crowd			0
" this rally is to let people know the umbrella movement is not over , " @entity18 said , referencing the iconic symbol chosen by the demonstrators when they occupied the streets of @entity1 for two - and - a - half months late last year			1
the turnout , though , fell far short of expectations , even for organizers			0
while the group behind the march -- the @entity33 -- had forecast 50,000 people to join , they estimated only 13,000 took part in the procession			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity39 put that number at just 8,800			0
while admitting some disappointment , @entity42 with the @entity33 was still upbeat , saying the march had achieved its main goal : to remind the @entity1 government that the reform proposal currently on the table for the 2017 election does n't go far enough			1
" in the coming days , i think people will try to give more political pressure , not only through demonstration , but civil disobedience , in order to fight for true democracy , " @entity49 said			1
@entity56 , a 19 - year - old student who joined the march , called it " half successful " because new groups had joined			0
some of them planned to meet after the rally to brainstorm the next steps , said @entity18 and other students			0
but it 's unclear where this movement , which drew over 100,000 protesters at its peak in 2014 , goes from here , without a clear leader or strategy to achieve its aims			2
as @entity1 works through the process of how its top leader will be elected in 2017 , the government has asked for feedback during a two - month period of public consultations			1
but @entity1 's leaders , including chief executive @entity78 , have made it clear that there are limits : reform must be within the framework outlined by @entity84			1
that framework has @entity1 's next leader being directly elected for the first time , but notes that the candidates for the ballot will be screened by a nominating committee			1
the government responded to sunday 's protest march with a statement on its website : " the ( government ) calls on all sectors of the community to adopt an accommodating , rational and pragmatic approach , as well as an inclusive attitude to express views , to forge consensus so that 5 million eligible voters can elect the chief executive by universal suffrage through ' one person , one vote ' in 2017			1
" one bright yellow sign held high by marchers along the route had a different interpretation : " @entity109			0
@entity111 , " it read			0
since its handover from the @entity113 in 1997 , @entity1 has been governed as a @entity114 of @entity115 under the concept of " one country , two systems			2
" @entity2 's @entity119 and journalist @entity120 contributed to this report .			0
