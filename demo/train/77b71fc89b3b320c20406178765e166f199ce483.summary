-- a @entity2 carrier has revealed that it replaced faulty batteries on its @entity5 fleet last year , as aviation authorities worldwide continue to ground the aircraft amid safety concerns over the devices			1
in an interview with the @entity12 , @entity10 ( @entity10 ) said the aircraft 's main battery failed to start normally on three occasions and had to be replaced along with the charger			1
in other cases , one battery showed an error reading and another , used to start the auxiliary power unit , failed			2
all the events occurred from may to december of last year , the report said			0
@entity23 , spokeswoman for @entity10 , told @entity0 wednesday that 10 lithium ion batteries on its 787s were replaced in 2012 , with a low charge being reported on some of the devices on board the aircraft			1
however , she said the problems were discovered during maintenance and therefore categorized as minor troubles			0
she added the airline was not required to report the faults to regulators			0
the news comes as an inspection of the @entity2 company that makes the batteries found no serious problem with the devices			1
@entity44 and @entity2 officials carried out a joint inspection at the facility in the city of @entity48 where @entity49 makes the batteries			1
while investigators found several issues in quality control at the company , they did not uncover any serious problems that can be linked to recent incidents involving @entity55 , @entity56 , director of air worthiness standards at the @entity2 transport ministry , said tuesday			1
two recent incidents -- a fire aboard the @entity62 aircraft in @entity64 's @entity63 on january 7 , and a smoke alarm aboard a plane flying over @entity2 on january 16 -- prompted the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) to ground all @entity55 in the @entity44 , and other nations across the globe quickly followed suit			1
what 's wrong with the @entity5 ? the investigation has now shifted from the battery maker to the manufacturer of the system that monitors the battery 's voltage and temperature , @entity56 said			1
officials from the @entity67 and the @entity2 transport ministry on monday began checking the quality control at @entity82 , in @entity83 , according to @entity56			2
they have n't found any serious problems so far , he said			0
@entity82 declined to comment on the matter			0
the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) said last week it had determined that the lithium ion battery on the @entity64 aircraft experienced a " thermal runaway " and a " short circuit			0
" but safety investigators have not determined which event occurred first , or whether they were the cause or the effect of the incident			0
in a thermal runaway , a battery releases energy in the form of heat , increasing the temperature of the battery and causing further damage			0
in an electrical short , electricity follows an unintended path			0
@entity5 , meanwhile , has said its technical experts are working " around the clock " and are focused on " resolving the issue " and returning the 787 to service			2
there are currently 50 wide body dreamliners in service globally , with several hundred on order			0
@entity10 was the first carrier to use the 787 and currently has 17 in service -- more than any other airline			2
how @entity5 can bounce back from @entity5 problems @entity0 's @entity121 in @entity120 contributed to this report .			1
