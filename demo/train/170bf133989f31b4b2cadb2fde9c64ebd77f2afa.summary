-- health care experts recently gathered at the @entity2 in @entity3 to discuss the public health crisis of hepatitis c , which is ravaging communities across @entity7 , and the budding hope that we may soon be able to eliminate it with a prescription medicine called @entity12			1
@entity13 , a chronic , potentially fatal liver disease , afflicts more than 3 million @entity7			1
solving the hepatitis c epidemic is a goal we should all embrace , which is why health plans are hard at work identifying at - risk patients so they can be screened and receive necessary treatment			1
@entity12 , the brand name for sofosbuvir , holds remarkable promise			2
but the manufacturer of this drug , @entity27 , has created an enormous obstacle that is straining our health care system : its eye - popping price			1
at $ 1,000 per pill , @entity12 costs $ 84,000 for a single course of treatment , and well over $ 100,000 when combined with other medications , as is generally the case			1
if every person with hepatitis c were treated with @entity12 alone at this price , the cost would be more than $ 268 billion			1
for some perspective , consider that in 2012 , the @entity7 spent $ 263 billion for all prescription drugs			1
this pricing , which @entity27 attempts to justify as the cost of medical advancement , will have a tsunami effect across our entire health care system			1
because the cost of health insurance is fundamentally a reflection of the price of health care services , the excessive price of @entity12 unavoidably puts upward pressure on premiums for everyone with private coverage			1
it will also strain state @entity61 and @entity62 programs			0
a recent analysis found that senior citizens on @entity66 could see premiums as much as 8 % higher next year because of the price of this one drug			2
and it 's been projected that @entity72 's medicaid spending on @entity12 and the accompanying drugs could potentially outpace what the state spends in a year on @entity76 and secondary education combined			0
high - priced drugs are not a new phenomenon			0
drug makers have long used monopolies to inflate prices			1
but the trend with so - called specialty drugs is a game changer			2
startling as the price of @entity12 is , it 's just the canary in the coal mine			0
more and more specialty drugs are coming on the market , with tremendous promise to save and improve lives but also with exorbitant price tags			0
although these specialty drugs only account for 1 % of the prescription drugs in this country , they already represent 25 % of the total cost , on the way to 50 %			2
until now , policymakers and stakeholders have looked the other way as specialty drug prices have gone higher and higher			2
in fact , any discussion of price has been quashed as an assault on innovation			0
but asking for a blank check in the name of innovation wo n't work anymore			0
not when it stands in the way of solving a public health crisis			0
not when it threatens state @entity61 budgets and the success of @entity66 , and not when the pricing threatens the very innovation that is giving so many hope			0
opinion : hepatitis drugs save money in long run we can not have sustainable medical innovation in @entity7 without prices that the health care system can sustain			1
just think , could we have eradicated polio or smallpox if the treatments were priced like hepatitis c ? today 's public health challenge is to find a balance that rewards research and development and brings breakthroughs to patients , without upending family budgets , employer benefit systems and crucial public programs			0
that 's going to require an end to the sky 's - the - limit pricing that threatens the progress we all want			0
now is the time for stakeholders to begin the process of working together to meet this challenge .			0

@entity154 : a new drug holds hope in eliminating epidemic of hepatitis c in @entity7
@entity154 : but drug costs outrageous $ 1,000 per pill , or $ 84,000 for entire treatment
she warns cost will raise premiums and prices all across the heath care spectrum
@entity154 : drug makers must stop trend of charging *astronomical* prices that hurt us all
