-- as the @entity2 concluded this weekend , it 's clear that the @entity3 are propelled by two competing claims -- a principled commitment to fiscal conservatism and a serious case of @entity8			1
the first group remains true to the roots of the movement as it emerged almost one year ago amid bailout backlash			2
they feel like modern @entity14 , warning their fellow citizens about the unsustainable nature of our government 's deficit spending and unprecedented debt			0
they still have an important civic role to play in our national debate			0
the second group reflects the overheated , hyperpartisanship that emerged over the august town halls and the 9/12 march on @entity29			0
oddly enough , this group embraced the tactics of @entity33 's @entity32 and applied them to the conservative cause , with angry confrontation and street theater protests			0
they ascribe to @entity38 every sinister characteristic imaginable -- often a secret plot to undermine our constitutional republic and put in a socialist , one - world government in its place			1
this is the crowd that carries the signs comparing @entity38 to @entity48 and communists , while proclaiming themselves patriots			1
their extremism will ultimately lead the movement to self - destruct unless it is clearly repudiated			1
the weekend 's controversial and much - covered @entity56 ended up being more of a conference than a convention			1
it offered speeches and seminars to a relatively small group of attendees			0
while @entity64 attracted some 300,000 people nationwide , this convention accommodated just 600 people , who paid nearly $ 500 each for the privilege of attending the populist conference			2
while the crowds at 2009 's protests were generally angrier than the speakers who climbed up onto platforms at last weekend 's conference , the dynamic was reversed			0
the crowd was generally more civil than the selected speakers			0
former congressman @entity77 accused the president of being a " committed socialist ideologue " and proposed a civic literacy test for voting			0
@entity83 founder @entity82 used his post-dinner speech , covered by @entity85 , to repeat inane " @entity87 " claims			0
@entity89 gubernatorial candidate and former state @entity91 chief justice @entity88 said @entity38 had " ignored our history and our heritage , arrogantly declaring to the world that we are no longer a @entity98 nation			1
" he also compared @entity38 to @entity101 by quoting the @entity102 : " a prince , whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a @entity106 , is unfit to be the ruler of a free people			1
" @entity107 was the most cautious by far , saying simply " @entity108 is ready for another revolution			1
" where will the @entity56 movement go from here ? the for - profit conference organizers declared that " we absolutely do not support a third party " and instead announced the creation of a new corporation and concurrent pac to support conservative candidates , primarily in the @entity119			1
this is still very much a leaderless movement with divergent tributaries			2
there 's no shortage of anger at the @entity125 for starting the path of deficit spending last decade and then backing the first round of @entity130 bailouts under @entity131			2
there is a rejection of politics as usual , the feeling that both parties are captive of their respective special interests -- big business and big government			0
what 's your take ? share your thoughts on the @entity56 movement for the @entity56 momentum to continue in a constructive way , it will need to take at least two further steps : first , repudiate the unhinged obama - haters and then focus its anger at fiscal irresponsibility into policy proposals instead of bumper - sticker platitudes			1
with a growing number of conspiracy entrepreneurs trying to profit off populist anger in a recession , it 's also worth keeping the conservative virtue of healthy skepticism in mind			2
remember what the author @entity162 warned in his book " @entity165 : " " every great cause begins as a movement , becomes a business and eventually degenerates into a racket			0

some in @entity56 movement have an @entity38 blind spot , @entity174 *observers*
if @entity56 movement is to last , @entity174 says the @entity38 *bashers* must be repudiated
@entity107 was the most cautious speaker at @entity181 convention , he says
@entity174 : movement must focus its anger at fiscal irresponsibility into policy proposals
