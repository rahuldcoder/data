-- the @entity1 released 154 hours of tape recordings and 30,000 pages of documents from the @entity5 on tuesday , offering a revealing look at the state of mind of @entity9 's 37th president at the start of what would prove to be his disastrous abbreviated second term			1
president @entity14 smiles and waves to a supporter in @entity17 in january 1973			1
the recordings , encompassing almost 1,000 conversations in january and february of 1973 , cover a range of topics , including , among other things , the conclusion of the @entity32 peace talks , the @entity27 's controversial @entity26 abortion rights ruling , the death of former president @entity29 , and a rapidly metastasizing @entity24 scandal			1
they show president @entity14 at both his best -- delving into the intricacies of @entity36 diplomacy -- and his worst , plotting against his perceived political enemies in the media and elsewhere			1
still basking in the afterglow of a landslide 49 - state reelection in 1972 , @entity14 at one point tells aide @entity42 that he wants nothing to do with those who would advise reaching out to critics in order to try and unify the country			1
" those people that wanted me to have [ an ] ' era of good feelings ' ... somebody wrote me a memorandum about that and i told [ @entity5 chief of staff h.r. ] @entity56 if anyone ever showed me that again i 'm gon na flush them down the goddamn john , " @entity14 says			1
" you should , " @entity42 replies			0
at another point , @entity14 tells then - @entity63 chairman @entity62 that the @entity64 can further boost its electoral fortunes by recruiting " attractive " women to run for office			2
recounting a recent visit to the @entity70 state legislature , @entity14 tells @entity62 that he " noticed a couple of very attractive women , both of them @entity64			2
... i want you to be sure to emphasize to our people , @entity74 , let 's look for some			0
... understand , i do n't do it because i 'm for women , but i 'm doing it because i think maybe a woman might win someplace where a man might not			0
... so have you got that in mind ? " @entity62 replies that he 'll " certainly keep it in mind			0
" @entity14 also indicates a deep distrust of his senior @entity92 officers , telling @entity42 on january 5 , 1973 , to start keeping a detailed log of phone calls made by then - national security adviser @entity95			1
" incidentally , i want it on his private phone too , " @entity14 tells @entity42			1
" we can get that , ca n't we ? " @entity42 then replies that he thinks it can be done			0
" sure , goddamn it			0
we can get it through the @entity104 , " @entity14 replies			2
" the @entity104 is to get , to keep the log , on his phone			0
that 's all we want to know , who the hell he calls			2
" the tapes often show @entity14 with a penchant for fixating on even the smallest political disruptions			2
on january 20 , 1973 -- the day of his second inauguration -- @entity14 calls a @entity115 agent to say he " saw the incident where some kid tried to rush the car ... i want to be sure they file a charge against him [ and do n't ] just let him go			1
" the agent assures @entity14 that the protester has been put in custody and that a charge has been filed			0
