-- my favorite thing about @entity3 is that there are so many different ways to live here			1
as i love to tell first - time visitors and far - flung friends who ask me why i 'd choose to make my home in such a crowded , expensive , dangerous , stuck - up , difficult place : first of all , it chose me ; and second , it 's what you make it			1
depending on your means and motivations , you could spend your days on the floor of the @entity17 , basking in the bright lights of @entity19 , stoop - sitting in the @entity20 , hawking fish in @entity22 , maxing out your platinum card on @entity24 or selling arepas under the 7 train after the nightclubs let out in @entity28 , @entity29			0
there are as many @entity31 as there are @entity3			1
or at least there were			0
today there are two : those with power and those hunkering down in the dark			2
when @entity40 savaged much of the @entity41 on monday night , it swallowed up lives and livelihoods and homes , and left the @entity46 ' most populous city with widespread electrical outages , and effectively landlocked			1
the disconnect is sharp , eerie and painfully familiar for longtime @entity3 who have weathered all manner of wounds to our city			1
victims fall to @entity56 's wrath i 'm writing this from my well - lit and warm apartment in @entity60 , as i wait for my husband to ferry my friend @entity62 and her dog @entity64 here from their home in @entity68			2
while we were lucky enough to suffer only power flickers and some overturned plants , @entity62 rode out the storm in her @entity74 apartment , just blocks from where a transformer exploded in a power plant in the height of the storm			2
@entity62 has been without electricity , running water , heat or much in the way of communication , and she 's uncertain what she 'll find -- other than total loss and an astonishing stench -- when she 's finally able to re-enter the walk - in refrigerator of her @entity20 restaurant			0
and yet , in the face of loss of possessions , inventory , revenue and shelter , she 's expressed just one emotion , gratitude , and one impulse -- to help others			0
and there 's a lot of help needed here			0
those in the dark zone -- effectively @entity68 below @entity105 and areas of @entity60 and @entity29 , especially along the waterfront -- who have been able to send up occasional digital flares have painted a dire picture of what 's going on around them			1
" isolated , no power , work coming , " reads a tweet from @entity113 â €			0

@entity0 's @entity116 finds her beloved @entity3 in dire *straits* after @entity40
those with power and *amenities* can do only so much to help less *fortunate* *neighbors*
the divide is stark between those able to communicate and **residents** who are shut off
@entity116 *invited* **residents** to share @entity40 impressions using the *hashtag* *#* *sandy5words*
