@entity0 , @entity1 -- the military released 77,000 of about 87,000 detainees locked up during the @entity6 war because there was not enough evidence to hold them , @entity2 has learned			1

" according to the @entity24 military , 76,985 detainees have been released out of the 87,011 captured during the @entity6 war			1

" @entity2 asked @entity15 to explain why , if it were so easy to collect evidence , so many detainees have been released			1
