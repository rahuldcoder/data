@entity0 -- house speaker @entity2 said friday she is " praying " that president @entity3 has a change of heart and does not veto a bipartisan children 's health insurance bill that he has labeled an unwarranted expansion of government - run health insurance			1
house speaker @entity2 applauds after signing the @entity11 legislation friday			0
" the tide is going a different way than a presidential veto would reflect , " @entity2 , a @entity13 @entity12 , said			0
" it was with great friendship that i reached out to the president this morning to say that i was still praying that he would have a change of heart and sign this legislation			1
" " i think i have to pray a little harder , but i will not give up , " @entity2 said			0
@entity2 's comments came a day after the @entity23 voted 67 - 29 for the measure , which would expand the @entity25 by up to 4 million children			1
@entity28 spokeswoman @entity27 on friday said @entity3 still intends to veto the bill when it arrives at his desk			1
@entity27 also said the disagreement between @entity32 and the @entity28 was a simple policy difference , not " about who cares about children more than the other			2
" " the president is saying , ' let 's take care of the neediest children first , let 's not put scarce federal dollars toward a program that was meant for the poorest children and let it creep up to middle - income families with incomes up to $ 83,000 a year , ' " @entity27 said			1
@entity3 and many @entity48 contend that the program 's original intent -- to give parents who make too much to qualify for @entity52 but not enough to buy private insurance coverage for their children -- would be changed under the current bill , prompting parents to wind up dropping private coverage their children already have to get cheaper coverage under the bill			1
@entity27 also objected that the rhetoric surrounding the @entity25 bill has become too heated			0
" i think it is preposterous for people to suggest the president of the @entity66 does n't care about children , that he wants children to suffer , " @entity27 said			2
the bill enjoys bipartisan support			0
eighteen @entity48 senators thursday night joined all the @entity72 in voting for expanding the popular program from its current annual budget of $ 5 billion to $ 12 billion for the next five years			2
four senators -- republicans @entity76 of @entity78 and @entity79 of @entity80 and @entity72 @entity81 of @entity82 and @entity83 of @entity84 -- did not vote			0
with the current program scheduled to expire saturday , the @entity28 encouraged @entity32 to send the president a continuing resolution extending the program			1
" we should take this time to arrive at a more rational , bipartisan @entity25 reauthorization bill that focuses on children in poor families who do n't currently have insurance , rather than raising taxes to cover people who already have private insurance , " @entity27 added			1
sen. @entity97 of @entity98 was among those republicans who split from the president			0
" it 's very difficult for me to be against a man i care so much for , " he told his colleagues on the @entity23 floor prior to the vote			0
" it 's unfortunate that the president has chosen to be on what , to me , is clearly the wrong side of this issue			0
" though 67 votes in the 100 - person chamber would suffice to overturn a veto , the @entity28 version , which was approved tuesday , fell short of the two - thirds majority needed to override a veto			2
