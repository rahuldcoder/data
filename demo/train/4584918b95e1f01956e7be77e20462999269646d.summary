@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 has a blunt message for labor union members : get to the polls next week , because " as bad as things are , they can get a whole lot worse			1
" as part of a massive get - out - the - vote operation , the labor federation is sending out 10 million personalized letters from @entity2 as a final mailing to its membership monday			1
enclosed with each letter is a detailed " slate card " tailored to each member			0
it lists all of the state - wide candidates endorsed by labor , as well as the candidates for the @entity25 and the state legislature			0
the card includes the person 's polling place and information about what kind of identification they may need to bring			2
@entity2 penned two letters monday , each with a different message , which the union 's spokesman called " the most sophisticated [ get - out - the - vote ] mail program the @entity3 has ever done			1
" the union uses " micro targeting " analysis to pinpoint the issues union members care about and that , in turn , determines which letter they will receive			1
in one version , @entity2 warns his members that if the @entity51 win control of @entity53 they will privatize @entity54 , send jobs to @entity56 , cut off any future extensions of unemployment benefits and let insurance companies take away health care coverage			1
the letter closes by saying , " get mad and do something about it			0
" the other personalized letter from @entity2 echoes the message president @entity66 and @entity67 have focused on over the past few weeks : undisclosed outside money is fueling an onslaught of television ads and distorting the records of pro-union candidates			2
this letter links the foreign money theme with the @entity67 ' other message on the economy : that big businesses are planning to outsource @entity78 jobs			2
@entity2 writes , " the same foreign companies that are stealing @entity78 jobs are now trying to buy our @entity78 elections			2
" including this mailing , the @entity3 has sent out 28.6 million pieces of political literature this midterm cycle			0
the labor federation also has call centers in 26 states that have high union membership and competitive congressional and statewide races			0
for example , in @entity94 , there are 17 call centers where members are contacting fellow labor workers urging them to vote a week from tuesday			1
volunteers are leafleting work sites and doing neighborhood walks to encourage people to turn out			0
while the @entity3 is not funding television ads on behalf of candidates , its largest member , the @entity106 , is putting tens of millions of dollars into ads. a spokesman for the @entity3 declined to give a figure for how much the get - out - the - vote effort is costing , saying the organization does n't want to give away any information to the other side about the extent of its efforts .			0
