we need someone who is extremely competent , extremely intelligent and extremely dedicated to the men , women and children of this country			2
we need someone who personally knows world leaders and understands the threats and challenges facing @entity16			0
we need someone who understands what middle - class families have been going through and how to give every family a fair shot to get ahead in life			2
our next president needs to be someone who knows without debate that equal pay for equal work and the full participation of women in our country is not only the right thing for them and their families , it 's critical for the economic future of @entity16			1
that 's why i am honored to formally announce my renewed and unreserved support for @entity40 as she considers a 2016 presidential bid			1
i 'm ready for @entity40 because she is the best person to take on the challenges that face our country , and she has more than enough qualifications , achievements and experience to do the job			1
while @entity40 and i came to the @entity50 at the same time after the 2000 elections , i have known her for more than 30 years			1
i first met @entity40 when i was serving in the @entity52 and she was serving as first lady of @entity54 and working as an attorney			1
we were both speaking on a panel at a national conference on children 's issues in @entity60			0
i had just passed one of the first child abuse prevention trust funds in the country and @entity40 was serving on the board of directors of the @entity65			1
that event was certainly an apt place to meet @entity40			1
for so many years before that and for the decades since , fighting on behalf of children and families has been a cornerstone of @entity40 's career			1
@entity73 tries to define @entity40 for young voters i was in the room when then - first lady @entity40 courageously spoke in @entity77 at the @entity78 and reminded the world that " women 's rights are human rights			1
" i will never forget the power of that speech			0
shortly thereafter , i was motivated to run for the @entity16 @entity52			0
@entity40 continued to speak up on behalf of women and girls around the world as secretary of state			2
and since passing the baton at the @entity90 to secretary @entity91 , she has once again made the fight for quality , universal early childhood education one of her signatures issues			0
the issues that will dominate the 2016 election are issues that @entity40 has been a leader on for years			1
she has been a champion for middle - class families and for those working hard to get into the middle class			0
she voted time and again to raise the minimum wage so people working full time would not find themselves still in poverty			0
she wrote the student borrower @entity105 and fought for lowering student loan rates by ending giveaways to the big banks			0

as president , @entity36 will fight for our values day in and day out			1
i also know @entity40 is practical and pragmatic			2
she understands how to get things done			0
i saw it in her that day in @entity60 so many years ago , watched her help accomplish great things like the @entity122 as first lady , worked with her here in the @entity50 to increase the minimum wage , and continued to be inspired by the grit , determination and old - fashioned hard work she put in across six continents and 956,733 miles as secretary of state			0
as secretary of state , @entity40 stood up for @entity16 and stood strong against our enemies			2
as president , she will stand up for all @entity16 and stand strong against those who want to rig our political system for their own gain			0
when @entity16 chooses its next president , we need someone who understands that people across this country are working hard and just want a fair shot to get ahead in life			2
