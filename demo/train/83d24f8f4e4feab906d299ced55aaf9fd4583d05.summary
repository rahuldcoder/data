-- did you set your clocks back this morning ? if you forgot , you may want to go ahead and do it now			1
do n't feel like you 're being rude ; we 'll wait right here for you			1
you have now given yourself the illusion -- as all of us do , every spring and autumn as we adjust our clocks and watches -- that you are in control of the concept of time			1
but that 's a battle that we all seem to have lost a while ago			1
every technological advance fools us into thinking that we have conquered time , that we have made it our servant			1
yet there is this nagging feeling that it is we who have somehow become enslaved			0
we suspect that our time is not , in fact , our own -- that it is some alien creature that has overcome us and altered us			1
we are constantly , as if against our wills , in a rush to be in a bigger rush			0
so why , then , does each day 's invisible finish line seem farther and farther away ? the other morning , i was in an airport when i saw an artifact from a dying era , something as evocative , in its own way , as the crumbling edifices of ancient @entity35			2
the artifact in the airport had been disabled , ready to be hauled off to the scrap heap			0
its name was printed upon it : " @entity42			0
" you may be familiar with the contraption			0
in the early 1990s , when 2000 still seemed distant and exotic , @entity42 started installing the things in airports across the @entity47 the @entity42 was far more advanced than a traditional pay telephone			0
it featured a glass screen , which blinked madly at passing men and women , inviting them to come hither			0
it had a wide bench seat			0
the idea was that the business traveler with an extra few minutes before his or her flight could sit down , insert a credit card , and -- here was the magical part -- send a written message to friends and associates in other parts of the country			2
they were big and bulky and undoubtedly expensive to produce , and soon enough they became all but useless because people now carry tiny personal versions of those machines in their pockets			2
which is why the wiring had been cut on the @entity42 that i saw the other day , and why it sat there in the terminal , unavailable for use			0
our ability to reach each other in a millisecond , and to reach the world at large , has progressed so rapidly that we did n't seem to fully notice as it happened			2
one day we were walking down city streets making eye contact with each other , taking in the local scenery , and the next we were staring at the screens of our hypnotic phones , receiving real - time messages and breaking - news updates from people hundreds of miles away			1
it was a tradeoff we did n't exactly ask for			2
yes , the concept of distance was all but erased -- but so , in a way , was the concept of place			2
we were sold the notion that we could be anywhere , with the tap of a key			0
what we only gradually began to recognize was that , by being everywhere , sometimes it felt like we were nowhere			0
any delay began to feel unacceptable			0
most of us grew up accustomed to having to wait for letters in the @entity47 mail ; when e-mail made that largely unnecessary , we told ourselves that the new speed of electronic correspondence was satisfying and ideal			1
but then came instant messages , which were			2
this was all supposed to save us time			1
yet do you feel as if time is something you have mastered ? do you believe that you have many more free hours to yourself now ? have the ever - sleeker - and - smaller machines and the ever - more - potent software cleared your schedule , made you a man or woman of leisure ? or do you sometimes worry that you are working for your handheld communication device , instead of the other way around ? " what 's new ? " has ceased to be a casual pleasantry , and has become an urgent demand			1
indeed , the word " new " itself has lost its punch ; in marketing campaigns , the adjective " new " has increasingly been tossed aside and replaced by the adjective " next			0
" " @entity138 " now seems somehow old			0
at family gatherings and get - togethers of friends , something is happening that would have seemed outlandish even a few years ago			0
people at the parties are posting photos and videos of the events on social networking sites even as the parties are still going on			1
thus , friends and acquaintances around the country and around the world are looking at the party pictures and videos and evaluating them before the party is even over			2
and people who are at the parties themselves , checking in on the same social network sites , are looking at the publicly posted pictures of the party they are still attending			1
it 's like a bizarre form of proactive nostalgia for something that has n't finished taking place yet			1
some day soon , even this will seem quaint and outmoded ; some day soon , this current ability to be constantly in touch will feel creaky and broken - down , like the @entity42 that was ready to be carted out of the airport			0
right around the next corner -- someone is already working on it -- the next generation of technology is almost ready , with the promise of compressing time and space in ways that will make us dizzy			1
and yet : has all of this increased your ability to take a deep breath , to relax , to savor the time that is available to you ? did all of the rushing deliver you to someplace better ? now			2
how did we get started on this ? oh			0
did you set your clocks back this morning ? you do n't want to let time get away from you			1
