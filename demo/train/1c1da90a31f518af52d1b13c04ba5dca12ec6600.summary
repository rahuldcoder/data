-- after president @entity2 signed the @entity3 , many anti-gun politicians looked forward to the day when they could completely ban the sale and ownership of firearms and perhaps even confiscate those already in private hands			0
after the draconian legislation imposed restrictions on " dealing " firearms that resulted in the prosecution of countless innocent gun collectors , and recordkeeping on ammunition sales so useless that federal law enforcement agencies supported their repeal , sen. @entity9 wrote to the @entity19 to demand our support for a national gun licensing and registration system			1
a few years later , a nixon administration advisory commission proposed that all side arms be outlawed and confiscated in about a decade			0
those hostile to firearms ownership and the @entity28 thought they were on the verge of victory , but had in fact managed to wake up millions of @entity33 who had n't previously believed that government would ever threaten their guns or their way of life			1
they were joined by others who were not necessarily gun owners but believed the @entity28 and the rights it guaranteed a free people worth preserving			1
opinion : @entity33 , even @entity19 members , want gun reforms the @entity19 was founded in 1871 , but until the passage of the 1968 legislation had never been much involved in politics and did n't even have a lobbying office			1
that changed as the men and women the organization represented demanded that the @entity19 step up to defend their rights in the frenzy of the late 1960s			2
within a few years , many of those who had so fervently believed that the public would welcome their sponsorship of " gun control " were defeated and before long @entity61 and @entity62 in @entity63 joined forces to pass the " @entity65 " of 1986 that rolled back many of the restrictions adopted in 1968			0
since that time , the @entity19 has continued to devote more than 85 % of its resources to its traditional mission of providing civilian firearms training , teaching firearms safety and working to introduce new generations of @entity33 to the shooting sports , but has taken on the added role of protector of the right of law - abiding @entity33 to own and enjoy firearms			1
that role has become especially important as some , unfortunately , have sought to exploit december 's incomprehensible murders in @entity83 , @entity84 , to impose further restrictions on honest people			0
the organization 's political strength rests on the bipartisan and diverse make - up of its membership and of the millions of nonmember firearms owners who look to the @entity19 for leadership and their willingness to step up to the plate and the ballot box when their rights are threatened			1
opinion : gun makers , help keep weapons out of criminals ' hands it is that second attribute of @entity28 supporters that has surprised the president and his allies			2
the @entity107 administration has attempted to demonize the @entity19 and cow gun owners into accepting restrictions that they know wo n't make anyone safer but which will interfere with a citizen 's ability to acquire , keep and rely on firearms to protect their families or participate in the shooting sports			1
among those proposals are " universal " background checks that will never be " universal " because criminals wo n't submit to them , and magazine bans that will put the law - abiding at a disadvantage against multiple attackers			1
the president also backs a new ban on " assault weapons , " even though @entity128 , the researcher who studied the last ban for the @entity130 concluded that it caused " no discernible reduction in the lethality or injuriousness of gun violence " and did not contribute to the general drop in crime in the 1990s			0
but gun owners have been energized rather than cowed			1
they are presenting a truly united front as they rally to fight for their constitutionally guaranteed rights			2
opinion : a father 's murder , a plea on gun control anyone who doubts this need only look at what happened in the literally bankrupt city of @entity152 , @entity153 , last week			0
the organizers of the largest outdoor show in the country , the @entity154 , announced that they would not allow the display or presence of the firearms the president likes to demonize as assault weapons			0
within days , more than 300 vendors withdrew in protest as the @entity19 and others urged @entity28 supporters to boycott the event			2
soon after , show organizers announced it was being postponed indefinitely			0
this was the largest outdoor show in the country			0
it draws a huge crowd every year and according to local estimates , about $ 80 million wo n't be arriving in the pockets and coffers of the @entity178 , anti-gun mayor of @entity152 now			0
as the battle over restricting @entity28 rights continues , other elected officials under pressure from the @entity107 administration to ignore the feelings and deep beliefs of some of their constituents will learn a similar lesson			1
hundreds of self - proclaimed gun advocates did n't believe @entity107 was anti-gun based on his first term and wrote the @entity19 saying we were using scare tactics to have our way : now they know			1
opinion : gun extremists ' alternate reality @entity28 supporters are in no mood to give those who would deny them their rights a pass and will vote in the next election in the same united way they responded to the insult leveled at them by the organizers of the @entity152 show			2
