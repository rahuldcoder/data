-- remember in the late ' 90s when you would kill time in @entity2 and @entity3 chatrooms or post on @entity6 ? you 'd strike up conversations with strangers about subjects you were all interested in , say " @entity11 , " container gardening or the @entity13			1
@entity14 wants to bring some of that community back with a fun new @entity17 app called @entity18			1
the free app , released on thursday , lets you create or join chatrooms based on shared interests			1
start a " room " for " @entity30 " fan fiction writers , toss up a background photo of @entity24 and customize your name or like button with gun or knife emojis			0
people who join the room can post photos , text and videos			2
you can share the invite widely or keep the guest list short , though the posts are public			0
the social media giant is 10 years old			0
that 's solidly middle - age in @entity40 years , as evidenced by the number of parents and grandparents who have successfully colonized @entity14			1
to avoid obsolescence , the company has been quick to jump on any new messaging trends that are hip with the kids			0
it bought @entity49 and @entity50			0
it made a @entity53 clone called @entity54 in 2012 , and another called slingshot earlier this year			0
recently , anonymity has been a hot topic embraced by standalone apps such as @entity59 and @entity60 , and cherished by people whose online personas are entirely pseudonymous			2
@entity14 saw first - hand how much people value being able to communicate under their chosen identities			1
the company started cracking down on members who were n't adhering to its " real - name " policy and incurred the wrath of activists and drag queens			0
rooms takes the opposite stance			2
it does n't require people to use their real names , and encourages chatters to use as many " nicknames " as they like for different rooms			1
in the blog post announcing the app , @entity14 's @entity81 trumpets the key feature			1
" in rooms , you can be ' @entity86 ' -- or whatever name makes you feel most comfortable and proud			2
you can even create different identities for different contexts			0

@entity14 's latest app rooms lets people chat about shared interests
people make up names and *switch* them up between chatrooms
the app is only available for @entity17 users and *launches* thursday
