" when the @entity6 outbreak started , it was very terrifying for everybody , " recalls @entity0 from @entity1 in @entity3 's @entity2			1
" people were afraid it could be transmitted by air and started believing all sorts of rumors about how to boost their immunity			2
" the virus has killed over 5,100 people worldwide , eight of which have been in @entity3			1
while his home country has been declared @entity6 free , @entity0 is creating a voice messaging system to raise awareness about the killer disease in the worst effected countries : @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
" over 70 % of people in @entity29 live in rural and semi-urban areas , " explains @entity0 , founder of the @entity27 mobile service			0
" these groups usually do not have access to internet but they have good mobile phone coverage			0
therefore , we saw the effectiveness in using the oldest means of communication -- voice -- to reach people			1
" @entity0 's vision is to reach people who are afraid to call authorities and ask for help -- the plan is that citizens will receive a call from @entity27 , but instead of getting advice from a foreign doctor , they will hear a recorded message from local celebrities			1
" we have connected with @entity52 , the retired @entity23 footballer , and we hope to get him involved soon , " @entity0 explains			0
" people can listen to community leaders more than doctors , " he claims			2
" that 's the reality , and to tackle this disease , we need to confront the reality			0
" the @entity27 concept impressed judges on the @entity61 , a mobile initiative that travels across @entity29 connecting entrepreneurs with investors			0
@entity0 and his team won the first prize -- particularly fitting given that the competition was nearly scrapped because of fears of contestants contracting @entity6			2
communications is key @entity0 's messaging platform is , however , just one of the many homegrown initiatives developed and rolled out across @entity29 to raise awareness and prevent the spread of @entity6 -- from mobile apps and education campaigns to catchy songs and multi-million dollar private donations , @entity71 are at the forefront of the war against the virus			1
in @entity85 , the ministry of health adapted a novel public health messaging platform designed to educate people about diabetes after the confirmation of the country first 's and only case of @entity6			1
as a result , four million sms messages were sent to the public warning of the dangers of the disease			0
and it worked -- the virus was stopped in its tracks and the @entity100 pointed to effective communications when explaining why @entity85 succeeded in stamping out @entity6			1
and in @entity3 a system called @entity103 has been praised for de-bunking myths about @entity6			2
developed by @entity106 , the technology allows citizens to ask questions and get replies in real - time			2
the added feature is that users can re-broadcast those answers to friends and relatives via sms			0
according to @entity117 , @entity106 @entity3 's chief of health , the free tool saw the number of subscribers double within first 24 hours of the @entity6 outbreak , because of the accuracy of information available on the platform			1
it was partly due to experts commenting on @entity127 that citizens started rejecting advice that salt water can protect against the virus -- a hoax which lead to the deaths of at least two people			2
in @entity23 , a text - message system aimed at health workers on the frontline is also gaining traction			2
launched by the country 's ministry of health and @entity106 , @entity140 ( @entity139 ) connects the ministry and health workers in real time by broadcasting messages about care and prevention			0
the platform also lets health workers know when their hazard pay is available as well as the status of dead bodies in communities			0
" @entity23 themselves have been at the frontlines of the fight against @entity6 from the very beginning while the country waited for international support to materialize , " explains @entity154 , founder of @entity155 , a group working to improve access to clean water in rural parts of the country			1
" the will is there , " she continues			0
" people want to kick @entity6 out of their communities , and ultimately they are the ones who are best positioned to do so			1
so we need to provide them with more resources like @entity140			0
" musical teaching @entity23 , the hardest hit country in the @entity6 outbreak , has also gone on to implement more creative education campaigns			1
health officials have teamed up with local musicians to create a catchy way of highlighting the risks of @entity6 in a country where roughly half of the population is under 18			1
over the thumping techno beat , the chorus runs : " @entity6 is real , it 's time to protect yourself , @entity6 is real , protect your family ... " and before @entity195 announced a new version of the charity single " @entity200 ? " focused on @entity6 , famous @entity71 musicians including @entity192 and @entity193 recorded a song to help raise awareness about the virus			1
" @entity207 " is performed in @entity202 and regional dialects , and the lyrics are a message about what citizens can do to stop @entity6 spreading			1
@entity209 fund funding is key for the growth of messaging platforms and mass public health programs			0
african business leaders from sectors including banking and mining came together recently , and committed $ 28.5 million and logistical support at a meeting in the @entity222 capital of @entity223			1
the fund , which will be managed by the @entity225 -- which has provided over $ 220 million in support -- and overseen by the @entity227 , will be used to support doctors , nurses and lab technicians			1
" the funding is part of a long - term roadmap for the post-outbreak reconstruction of the affected countries , " explains @entity232 professor @entity231 who attended the talks			0
" what i saw at the roundtable was a strong sense of collective responsibility and focus on getting the job done			0
" this pledge may be the largest to date from @entity29 's private - sector , but it is not the first			0
in october , @entity248 founder of @entity249 ( @entity250 ) and @entity252 's first black billionaire , donated $ 1 million to the @entity253 in @entity25			2
spotlight on @entity29 despite these cash injections , @entity256 - born social entrepreneur @entity255 says support for for local initiatives remains thin			2
" very little of @entity29 's front line efforts to stop the spread of @entity6 is visible in @entity263 and as a result , very little material support is going to these organizations , " he wrote in a recent blog post			1
it is for this reason he formed the @entity271 website to promote the work of four community organizations working on the ground in @entity23 -- @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity155 and @entity277			0
" we , as @entity71 , have to break the mentality that responding to crises on our continent is the mandate of the international community , " wrote @entity255			0
" it will be @entity71 themselves who win this war on the ground			0
