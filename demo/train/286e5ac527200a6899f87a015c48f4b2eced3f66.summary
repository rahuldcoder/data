@entity0 -- to a degree some may find hard to swallow , science is proving the old adage " you are what you eat			0
" @entity7 eat corn in the form of chips but also consume it in the ubiquitous high fructose corn syrup			1
proteins and fats in your food are incorporated into your body and brain with potentially profound effects on your health and even your behavior			0
@entity20 , a plant biologist at the @entity21 , can test a strand of hair to determine how much corn is in your diet or mine by looking for a form of carbon found in corn			1
" we are what we eat with respect to carbon , for sure			0
so if we eat a particular kind of food , and it has a particular kind of carbon in it , that 's recorded in us , in our tissues , in our hair , in our fingernails , in the muscles , " @entity20 says			0
@entity20 tested a strand of my hair : 69 percent of the carbon came from corn			2
this may seem high , but it is typical for @entity7			2
" we 're like corn chips walking because we really have a very , very large fraction of corn in our diets , and we actually ca n't help it because it 's an additive in so many of the foods we find on the market shelves , " @entity20 says			1
@entity61 like ketchup , salad dressing , soda , cookies and chips all contain corn , usually high fructose corn syrup			2
" i think where the danger comes in with corn is that much of the corn grown now in @entity68 is going into making high fructose corn syrup , " @entity20 says			0
" so it 's not that corn per se is bad , but it 's the sweetener made from corn that gets into many of the foods that @entity7 are probably consuming too much of , and we now see that showing up as obesity and heart disease and potential for type 2 diabetes			1
" to be fair , researchers say we 're eating too much of all kinds of sugar , not just high fructose corn syrup			2
and the @entity84 points out that " many parts of the world , including @entity87 and @entity88 , have rising rates of obesity and diabetes , despite having little or no high fructose corn syrup in their foods and drinks			0
" @entity88 eat a diet with far fewer processed foods and corn - based sweeteners			1
@entity20 tested his own hair after three months in @entity99 : 5 percent corn			2
@entity7 also eat an extraordinary amount of soybean oil , another key ingredient in most processed foods			0
checking labels during a recent trip to the grocery store i found soybean oil in everything from tortilla chips to fruit syrup			0
dr. @entity113 at the @entity114 estimates that soybeans , usually in the form of oil , Â­ account for an astonishing 10 percent of our total calories in the @entity7			1
in recent years , a form of soybean oil has been the primary source of trans fats , which raises levels of @entity126 , or bad cholesterol , in our bodies and is thought to contribute to heart disease			0
our bodies need a balance of omega - 6 fatty acids like soybean oil and omega - 3 fatty acids like fish oil , @entity113 says			1
over the last century , our diets have shifted almost completely to omega - 6 fatty acids			1
" it 's quite likely that most of the diseases of modern civilization , major depression , heart disease and obesity are linked to the radical and dramatic shift in the composition of the fats in the food supply , " @entity113 says			0
our brains are composed of fatty acids , and an absence of omega - 3 fatty acids can actually change our behavior , according to @entity152			1
@entity113 's research suggests diets containing omega - 3 fatty acids found in fish reduce depression , aggression and anger , while improving mental well - being			1
quite literally , food for thought			0

biologist : ' we 're like corn chips walking '
soybeans account for 10 percent of calories in @entity7 , @entity114 *doctor* says
more omega - 3 fatty acids in diet can improve mental health , he says
