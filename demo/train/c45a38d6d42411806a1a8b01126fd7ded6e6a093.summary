former president @entity1 's abrupt fall from grace has taken many in political circles in @entity4 by surprise , further widening the gap between an increasingly insular and narrow hard - line elite and the rest of the country			1
it reinforces a trend towards the consolidation of power around @entity15 ayatollah @entity14 and his acolytes , which has been taking place for the better part of a decade , and perhaps the real surprise is the fact is that there remain members of the elite who did not think this remorseless process would ultimately apply to them			1
ever since the political catastrophe of 2009 , when millions pored onto the streets to protest what was widely considered to be a highly fraudulent election process , the regime has been keen to encourage the public to put the past behind them and to look forward to these elections as a cathartic exercise during which political blemishes could be washed away			1
@entity1 's dramatic last - minute entrance into the race , was seen by many as proof that some lessons had indeed been learnt			0
but if @entity1 was to galvanize the public , then his platform had to be radical and his boast that he had come to " save the nation " and effectively " reboot " the @entity47 , was certainly bold			2
however , the fact that he claimed that he had to ask permission to run , was indicative of how far the political realities of @entity4 had changed since he had last been president ( 1989 - 1997 )			1
no sooner had he registered than the bitter personal attacks came from the hard - liners ; while others questioned just what the nature of the agreement with @entity14 had been , if any			1
@entity58 explains : @entity4 's presidential election but perhaps most galling was that for all the hype and excitement generated by his supporters , the public appeared unmoved			1
popular momentum might have developed , though the task would have been considerably harder than 2009 given the absence of a political infrastructure of street activists , ( largely dismantled since 2009 ) , and above all the sheer cynicism of the voting public			2
public apathy combined with the conceit of the new ruling class , to deliver a particularly brutal humiliation to @entity1 , barred apparently not for his political views , but for the rather less dignified reason that the members of the @entity80 thought @entity1 too old to be able to bear the burden of office			2
@entity1 's dramatic entrance and precipitous fall has shone a light on the growing fractures within elite politics in @entity4			1
to date @entity14 has been able to blame divisions on @entity89 and his " deviant current " on the one hand , and the foreign inspired sedition of @entity93 and @entity94 ( still under house arrest ) on the other			1
few expected @entity89 's protégé , @entity97 , to survive the vetting process -- other that is , than @entity89 , for whom being on the " outside " must be an uncomfortable experience			1
similarly , if slightly more realistically , few of @entity1 's supporters considered him vulnerable			0
he remained after all a pillar of the establishment , even if two of his children had been hounded into jail and he had effectively been ostracized over the past four years for his tentative support of the @entity109			0
read more : how the @entity110 should respond to @entity4 's election it says much of the " wishful thinking " that remains prevalent , that they thought this a political virtue			1
firm in the belief that the @entity47 faced an existential threat , they had retained their faith in the integrity of a system that has long since transformed beyond recognition into a sacred autocracy			0
indeed the unpredictability of the @entity4 political system is not a reflection of its inherent ' democracy ' , but of the absence of the rule of law and the growing identification of power in the person of @entity14			1
both the @entity80 's " rulings " ( which it should be stressed are neither published nor explained ) and the fact they can be overturned on the whims of the @entity15 , are indicative of this harsh reality			1
what we are left with is a tightly controlled " election " with a dry and uninteresting field			0
of the eight ratified candidates , one is a nonentity , ( @entity148 ) ; two are ostensible " moderates " lacking in charisma and therefore non-threatening , ( @entity151 and @entity152 ) ; one is an independent principle - ist ( @entity153 ) who likes to speak his mind but on past performance is unlikely to garner votes ( real or imagined ) ; while the remaining four are self proclaimed acolytes of the leader			0
of these four , two have been highlighted as the probable annointees : @entity161 , the current head of the @entity163 , and @entity164 , the mayor of @entity165			0
@entity161 is widely assumed to be the favorite and his web presence is suitably polished and indicative of considerable preparation , though quite who the audience for this is , given the current restrictions on internet access in the run - up to the election , remains unclear			0
@entity161 is perhaps closest ideologically to the @entity15			2
for this particular puritan , the crisis @entity4 faces is not existential , it is an opportunity to be seized and a trial to be welcomed			2
@entity164 , who once fancied himself as @entity4 's answer to @entity181 , has had his popular credibility bruised by the sudden release of a recording of a speech he allegedly gave to members of the @entity188 militia bragging about how much he enjoyed getting on his motorbike and thumping students			2
@entity164 has vigorously dismissed the recording as a malicious smear , but it says much about current politics that there are many who find it credible			0
the real question of course is the source of the leak ; and herein perhaps lies the real significance of recent developments			0
in 2009 , the regime lost the people ; it now appears to be in the process of divesting itself of its traditional elite			0
how the newly disenfranchised react will be interesting to watch			0
this may be the real legacy of the " election " of 2013 .			0
