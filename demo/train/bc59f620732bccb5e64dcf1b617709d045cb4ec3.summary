-- recently , @entity1 , chairman of the @entity2 , came under fire for reportedly proposing exceedingly weak " open @entity5 rules			1
" if the reports are correct , the @entity2 will allow broadband providers like @entity8 to make special deals that give some companies preferential treatment , as long as those deals are " commercially reasonable			1
" in other words , rather then requiring broadband providers to treat all internet traffic more or less equally , the @entity2 will permit them to create an @entity5 " fast lane " and shake down content providers like @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 for the right to travel in it			1
guess who will really end up paying for the fast lane ? @entity23 -- you , the customers			1
the price will be higher than you think			0
not only will you have to pay more for the services you already use , but you will also lose out on emerging services that will be crushed by the new costs			1
@entity31 and @entity17 may be able to " pay to play			2
" but innovative competitors -- the next @entity33 , @entity34 or @entity31 being dreamed up in someone 's garage right now -- may not			0
the proposed rules are n't all bad			0
the @entity2 will also require @entity38 to be more transparent about the deals they make so customers will know what they are getting			1
the @entity2 will also caution @entity38 against making deals that favor their own affiliated businesses ( we 're looking at you , @entity8 -- no special favors for your friends at @entity50 )			1
unfortunately , even " transparency " is tougher to enforce than many might think , because so much of our connectivity depends on secret agreements between various kinds of internet service providers			1
the devil is in the details			0
the good news is that we will have a chance to look at those details in a few weeks and tell the @entity2 what we think			2
the @entity2 will be voting on the new rules at its may 15 meeting			1
if it votes to adopt them , it must publish the proposed rules in advance and respond to public concerns about them			2
the problem is that most people do n't know how this process works , and so they do n't participate			0
( the @entity73 is building a tool that will make that easier ; visit our site next month at @entity76 ) the @entity5 is too important to leave to bureaucrats who seem more beholden to the @entity38 than the public			0
we need to let the @entity2 know we will not tolerate rules that let @entity38 pick and choose how well @entity5 users can connect to one another			2
if we really want to stop net discrimination , we need to foster a genuinely competitive market for internet access			0
right now , subscribers have few @entity38 options in many markets			0
if subscribers and customers had adequate information about their options and could vote with their feet -- i.e. , switch providers -- isps would have strong incentives to treat all network traffic fairly			2
moreover , they would also have an incentive to improve our internet speeds			0
most @entity100 do n't realize it , but the @entity100 is falling behind when it comes to high - speed internet			1
we pay much more for much less than subscribers in other developed countries like @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			2
subscribers in those countries are getting internet service that is 100 times faster than the fastest connection in the @entity100 -- for a fraction of the average @entity100 cable bill			1
we can do better , but only if we start demanding more from @entity38			0
already , our lagging @entity5 speeds are likely to have serious consequences			0
" what 's at stake is whether the new jobs , new ideas , new services of the 21st century will come from the @entity100 or they 'll come from @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , where kids are already playing in the virtual sandboxes of these very high capacity networks , " noted @entity116 , a legal scholar who has served on president @entity119 's science and tech team			1
our isps have no incentive to invest in building powerful , competitive , networks			0
why should they ? it 's not like their customers are going anywhere			2
fortunately , efforts are under way to address this			0
for example , all around the country , cities are investing in their own broadband networks , some successfully			0
fostering strong alternatives in high - speed internet access wo n't be easy , and community broadband alone wo n't be the panacea			2
but it 's a start , and a movement the @entity2 should support			1
we 'll need more experiments like these if we want the @entity5 to continue to be an extraordinary platform for free expression , innovation and commerce			0
so let 's make sure the @entity2 hears us loud and clear : reject " pay to play " and resist monopolies so that everyone benefits , not just the powerful internet service providers .			1

the @entity2 might allow internet service providers to charge more for a " fast lane "
@entity167 : high costs will go to customers ; internet competition will be *stifled*
she says other advanced countries pay far less and get faster service than @entity100
@entity167 : on may 15 , the public can weigh in on @entity2 's *decision* and voice concerns
