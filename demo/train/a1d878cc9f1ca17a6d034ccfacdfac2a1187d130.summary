@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , a student from @entity4 attending the @entity5 , had lost all hope for her family in @entity8 , the fishing village where more than half of the 17,000 residents are missing and feared dead in the aftermath of last week 's tsunami			1
for three days , she scoured the @entity13			0
she received one e-mail that her youngest sister , @entity15 , 13 , was likely safe in her middle school 's shelter			1
but what about her parents , paternal grandparents and older sister , who all lived under the same roof ? when the mayor was quoted in the media as saying he barely survived the tsunami , @entity3 thought the worst , because her father 's pharmacy was located near the town hall			1
" i did n't think they survived , " @entity3 , 20 , told @entity2 during a tearful interview tuesday			1
" i cried for three days -- friday , saturday , sunday			0
" then she received word sunday night from a friend in @entity4 of the existence of a 45 - second @entity35 video showing her family home as the only one standing amid the rubble			1
the video highlighted her older sister holding a sign to a tv news crew saying in @entity4 " we are all safe			1
" @entity3 expressed relief upon hearing of the video , but became distraught after she could n't find it online , despite staying up all night looking for it			1
then a contact through a @entity4 social network e-mailed her the link monday morning			2
when seeing the video for the first time inside the home of her host family , @entity3 's reaction surprised everyone in the household			1
" i screamed , and my host parents woke up and they thought it was really bad , " @entity3 said			1
" they asked what happened			0
and i said , ' they survived ! ' " in the video , her 24 - year - old sister , @entity64 , is standing on the family home 's balcony , off @entity3 's bedroom , and is asking the tv crew to pass along word to her sister in @entity72 that she 's safe			1
now @entity3 is trying to respond by using the media and the @entity13 to inform her relatives she 's aware of their message -- though she 's still concerned about them in the obliterated coastal village , which media accounts liken to a ghost town			1
@entity3 has yet to see her father , @entity81 ; mother , @entity82 ; or paternal grandparents on any video -- or receive any word from them			2
though she speaks @entity86 , @entity3 extended a message to them , in @entity4 , through a @entity2 news crew : " my older sister , @entity64 , i saw your video			1
thank you very much for being alive			0
it made me really happy that you are worried about me even in this tough situation			0
" @entity95 and grandma , how is your health ? @entity98 and mom , i know that everything is tough right now with your job and everything but i am so glad that you are alive			0
i really look forward to seeing you guys again			0
" in the offices of the @entity5 at @entity106 , where she began a year - long study of @entity86 last september , @entity3 provided a personal narrative to the stark footage of her hometown street now in ruins			1
@entity3 's family home is the only one left standing on a hill because her father reconstructed the two - story house with a basement five years ago , @entity3 said			1
the other houses in the neighborhood were aging , she said			0
@entity3 expressed shock that the earthquake or the tsunami demolished the block because she thought the area would be safe on high ground , she said			1
her family 's house has a scenic view of the ocean , just a five - minute walk away , she said			1
in the video , a news crew approaches the family house , and @entity3 's older sister is wearing a white helmet and holds up one sign saying , " @entity136 , " and then another saying , " we are all safe			1
" at another point in the video , the older sister indicates she 's holding up the signs to the camera crew " because my younger sister is in @entity72			2
" when @entity3 heard of the video 's existence , she thought to herself , " i could n't believe it			1
it 's a miracle , " she said			0
since seeing the video , she watched it over and over again -- at least " 50 or something " times within about 24 hours , she said , offering a wild guess			0
as she reviewed the video again tuesday morning , @entity3 was still incredulous			2
" this is my house , " she said , viewing the video on a university office computer			0
" when i saw this video , i was very shocked by it			0
i thought ( the hillside community ) was safe			2
there were houses next to my house , but they were destroyed			0
that means the tsunami came up to the house			0
" she was moved to see her sister shouting to the news crew from the balcony			0
" it makes me very happy , " @entity3 said			2
" it 's the only way to hear her voice			0
" her sister 's voice , though , struck @entity3 as " tired and depressed			1
" " maybe she tries to stay strong for my family			0
so i 'm very proud of her , " @entity3 said			2
she believes her parents are likely ok , but her grandfather , @entity176 , is 85 and grandmother , @entity178 , is 80			0
" my grandparents are old , so i 'm worried about their health , " @entity3 said , adding no one in her hometown probably has water , and the winter weather is still cold , with snow			2
she 's also worried about the family pharmacy , where her father , 52 , is a pharmacist and her mother assists			2
the family opened it 10 years ago			0
" i think it was his dream , " @entity3 added			2
since @entity3 saw the video , she has been sharing her story with classmates			2
" i cried in front of them too much , " she said tuesday			0
the @entity5 at @entity106 is the continuing education branch of the university and has an enrollment of 4,000 students from 60 countries who participate in @entity86 - language study or certificate programs , said @entity205 , associate dean and head of international programs			0
of the 4,000 students , 109 of them are from @entity4 , and five of them had families affected by the quake or tsunami or both , @entity205 said			1
it is only @entity3 , though , who has yet to have direct contact with her family , @entity205 said			1
" the story is quite amazing , " @entity205 added .			0

@entity3 , 20 , is from the tsunami - *wracked* village of @entity8 , @entity4
more than half of that coastal town 's 17,000 residents are missing
for three days , she thought her family perished
but then she saw her sister on @entity35 sending a " we are all safe " message
