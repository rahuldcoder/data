@entity1 , @entity0 -- sportsmen and women being caught taking drugs is not a new phenomenon -- but it 's still a shock when the news breaks			2
@entity10 's @entity9 was sacked by @entity11 and banned from the game for testing positive for cocaine			0
only recently @entity14 , who shattered @entity16 records by claiming eight golds in the pool in @entity19 last year , was caught on camera with a marijuana pipe to his mouth			0
the @entity23 is far from alone			0
the history of sport is peppered with drug use , usually of the performance - enhancing kind : athletics has been blighted by it , cycling has lost much of its credibility because of it and baseball has proven to be far from immune			1
but football , the world 's most popular game in terms of fan following and participation , does not seem to have had its share of drugs scandals , not least in the world 's most high profile division , the @entity45			1
no top - flight player in @entity0 football has ever tested positive for using performance - enhancing drugs in a league match			1
the closest anyone has come is @entity52 defender @entity51 , who was banned from football by @entity53 for 18 months in 2005 when he tested positive for the steroid dianabol after a @entity56 match			2
the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) takes its lead on doping from @entity60 , the body which regulates drug testing in the @entity63 based on the code set out by the @entity65 ( @entity65 )			1
let us know your views of drugs and drug testing in football			1
@entity60 's @entity71 does not believe more tests would necessarily return more positive results			2
" it 's a difficult question to answer , " he said			0
" the stats show what they show			0
but it 's fair to say if doping was going on at that level we would have unearthed it			0
" our focus at @entity60 is not on more and more testing -- we do n't think that 's going to answer the question about whether there 's more doping out there			0
" what we want to do is make every test we do as effective as possible			0
if there are people out there doping we 've got to have the right level of intelligence and information to target them			0
" testing at no notice and out of competition is where we think we 've got the best chance of being able to catch any sportsmen taking drugs , " he added			2
@entity0 footballers can be tested after matches ( in competition ) and at training sessions ( out of competition )			0
until a few years ago , a tester was forbidden from turning up at a footballer 's house unannounced ( no notice )			0
but the @entity57 has altered its stance as part of its claim that it " maintains the largest and most comprehensive out - of - competition testing program in international football			1
" they conduct 1,600 random , no - notice drug tests per season , which the @entity65 and the @entity121 state is the most effective method of combating the use of drugs in sport			1
but those 1,600 tests are conducted on professional players , non-league football , women 's football and youth team football			1
it means the chances are small of catching any @entity45 star who may be using drugs			2
down the years , @entity136 's @entity135 has seen the most cases of players getting caught with either performance - enhancing or recreational drugs in their system			1
one reason for this is the @entity146 authorities ' no - nonsense stance : two players from each squad are drawn at random to be tested after every match			1
household names such as @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 have all been caught in the last two decades			0
by way of comparison , @entity159 , a goalkeeper in one of @entity0 's lower leagues , was let off with warning after being found to have taken the steroid nandrolone in the 2002 - 03 season			2
it took a further positive test for cocaine for him to get a six - month ban			2
but on the issue of combating social drugs -- something not demanded by @entity65 's code -- @entity71 believes the @entity57 's stance is to be applauded			1
he said : " they invest heavily in their testing program			0
they recognize that a particular problem for their sport is social drugs so this separate testing goes on			1
they do n't have to do it			0
" this carries a different set of sanctions which are controlled by the @entity57 and the aim of that program is about rehabilitation rather than punishment			1
" @entity71 said the sanctions send out a strong message that the @entity57 is prepared to do something about it			1
" they recognize their responsibility -- football is a huge role model for youngsters , " he added			2
@entity201 , then of @entity202 , became the first @entity45 player to fail a drug test when he tested positive for cannabis in 1995			0
he was back playing within a month following a brief spell in rehab			0
@entity11 's @entity208 and @entity9 have both been caught with cocaine in their systems and both were banned and sacked by the club in the 2000s			0
the @entity57 also wants to make sure that players understand that not taking a test is not an option either , making an example of @entity219 's @entity218			1
the center - back missed a scheduled drugs test in 2003 and was belatedly suspended for eight months and fined Â£ 50,000			2
@entity218 could have got a bigger punishment			0
the @entity57 's guidelines state that for a first offence a minimum suspension of three months up to a maximum of two years will apply , but a lack of consistency has always dogged punishments for drug offences			1
no other footballer has been reported as missing a test since			0
the @entity57 is far from blind to the issue of drugs in @entity0 football and since the @entity218 incident their policies and punishments have been tightened			1
but as long as a player 's chances of getting caught remain comparatively small , drugs in football appears to be an issue the @entity57 is keeping a lid on rather than eradicating .			1

football has seen a number of high - profile players fail drugs tests
@entity57 tests for both performance - enhancing and social drugs
different punishments are given *depending* on the offence
