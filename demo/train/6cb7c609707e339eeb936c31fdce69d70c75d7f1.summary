-- state sen. @entity2 ' stand in @entity3 was the " filibuster heard round the world " -- suddenly everywhere you look , you see news about one state or another rolling back reproductive rights			2
even as all eyes were on resumed hearings in @entity3 late tuesday night , the @entity12 legislature was busy sneaking anti-choice measures into an unrelated bill , and wednesday that bill passed the @entity18 over the fierce objections of @entity12 women			1
but the more i read about what is happening to women 's rights , the less i see about how anti-choice lawmakers are passing these bills			0
we 're taught as kids that cheaters never win , but that lesson did n't sink in with @entity31 leaders in @entity3 and in many other states where these rights are under attack			1
instead they 've decided that if you do n't have the people with you to pass a bill , you can just change the process			2
take the @entity3 bill : a hodgepodge of arbitrary restrictions , it would close nearly 90 % of the clinics that perform abortions in @entity3 , making it impossible for women across the state to access all sorts of medical care they need and deserve			1
it would also ban all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy , which compromises the moral and medical autonomy of women who need care			0
following on 12 other states that have enacted the unconstitutional ban , @entity3 @entity31 are trying to put in place costly restrictions to solve a problem that does n't exist : the number of abortions after 20 weeks is tiny ( less than 2 % ) and are most often sought by women in desperate circumstances , exactly the kind of cases that require close attention by doctors , not sweeping prohibitions by ideological politicians			1
the @entity31 could n't pass this bill in regular session -- @entity3 law requires a two - thirds @entity18 majority for these measures , and the @entity31 simply did n't have it			1
so instead of building support the old - fashioned way for this radical legislation , gov. @entity78 decided he 'd just change the rules			0
he called a special session after the end of the normal legislative period , and his friend , lt. gov. @entity85 , declared they no longer needed a super majority vote			1
what they did n't count on was opposition from citizens who knew the rules and would n't stand by while @entity31 cheated			2
in the @entity94 , @entity31 committee members shut down legally mandated public hearings when witness after witness testified that they resented this intrusion into private , personal medical decisions ; then committee members voted on the bill in a private room where the public could n't see what they were doing			1
and finally , in the move that earned them national disdain , they tried to use every dirty trick in the book to shut down @entity111 ' historic talking filibuster in the final hours of this widely watched session			2
they challenged the content of her speech			0
they cried crocodile tears about her receiving assistance to don a back brace			0
they ignored @entity123 who were raising legitimate procedural questions			0
republicans presiding over the debate recognized their fellow @entity31 when @entity123 had the floor			2
one senator , @entity129 , even had to ask : " at what point must a female senator raise her voice or hand to be recognized over the male colleagues in the room ? " and then , after @entity137 watching in the gallery erupted in jeers at the strong - handed tactics @entity31 were using , the @entity31 leadership held a vote after midnight , after the special session had officially ended			1
they then changed the time stamp on the official record of the vote , only changing it back after they were caught red - handed			1
that meant the bill was dead , so gov. @entity78 did what cheaters do when they lose -- he called for a do - over			0
i wish i could say the tactics in @entity3 were the exception , but @entity31 are using underhanded ploys like these to pass anti-choice bills all over the country			1
in @entity160 , @entity31 sneaked a requirement for unnecessary ultrasounds into a budget bill , without holding public hearings			1
in @entity12 , they shut out testimony from pro-choice activists late in the night to move their draconian measures to the floor for a vote			0
on monday , i stood in the hot @entity171 sun with thousands of fellow @entity137 who share my outrage at this attack on our fundamental rights			0
but they did n't just cheer for @entity111 ' stand to protect women 's rights and health			0
they were there to celebrate the rule of democracy , rules that @entity31 have shown they will change if it suits their political ends			2
but changing the rules does n't change the truth			0
i do n't know what will happen at this next special session in @entity3 , but i do know that if @entity31 cheat their way to victory in this battle , they are going to lose the war for the confidence of the people they seek to represent			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			0

@entity200 : @entity3 is trying every trick in the book to get an *anti-abortion* bill passed
many oppose bill that would shut 90 % of abortion clinics in state , she says
@entity200 : @entity31 could n't pass this bill in regular session , so *governor* called special session
@entity200 : @entity3 *bypassed* legally mandated public hearings , tried to change time stamp of vote
