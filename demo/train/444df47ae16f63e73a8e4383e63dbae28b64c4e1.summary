-- the slaughter of hundreds in @entity2 this week was horrifying			1
the response of the @entity4 to that slaughter seemed puny and impotent			1
the president and the secretary of state offered strongly worded condemnations , and the @entity4 canceled its participation in a military exercise that probably would n't have happened anyway , given the unrest			1
around the world critics suggested the @entity4 was either effectively condoning the violence or sending a strong message that it would n't penalize the @entity2 military for this or future harshness			1
it did n't help that after his statement the president slipped off for a round of golf			0
the unnecessarily callous optics of the golf game aside , the unsettling reality is that @entity4 's options were puny and likely to have very little effect			1
indeed , the @entity27 wisely avoided falling into the trap of " feel good measures : " bold gestures that may resonate but ultimately wo n't work			1
some argue the @entity4 should suspend the delivery of some or all the $ 1.3 billion in annual aid it sends to the @entity2 government			1
but this would only further reduce the limited influence we have over the @entity2 military			1
mosque at center of @entity2 clashes it is important to remember that after @entity2 president @entity46 's overthrow , governments from the @entity43 in a matter of days offered the new @entity2 government 10 times the amount the @entity4 gives each year			1
not only did this shift the balance of influence away from the @entity4 , but it also raises the possibility that they might well have replaced any funds we withdrew , blunting the impact of our actions			1
it is also important to remember that the situation in @entity2 is not black and white			1
while there is no excuse for the kind of massacres that took place this week , the @entity61 also has a share of responsibility for the situation on the ground			0
the @entity46 government regularly abused its authority , trampled on basic human rights and was so widely reviled in @entity2 that its overthrow was welcomed by tens of millions of citizens			2
indeed , if you are looking for a place to fault the @entity4 response , look to our relative tolerance of @entity46 's abuses and our failure to strongly and effectively call him out as his government crushed personal freedoms , suppressed the press , threw opponents in jail and stood by as the @entity61 actively sought to sow discord throughout the @entity89			1
had the @entity4 been tougher back then and had it worked more with the international community to tie total aid flows to better behavior , it could have helped forestall the current situation			1
the @entity4 consistently did and said too little too late			2
it also fell into the trap of overstating the legitimacy that being elected conferred on @entity46 , even as he undercut that legitimacy by acting in a perniciously undemocratic way			0
is it still safe to travel to @entity2 ? this last overall point contains the secret to effective @entity4 leverage over @entity2 and many countries these days			1
the @entity4 can not have much impact acting alone			1
unless -- in an instance like this -- it can speak for a broad cross section of aid - giving countries and institutions , the impact of any conditions it sets is likely to be limited			2
impact requires purposeful , active political and economic diplomacy at the highest levelâ € ” including the willingness to pressure friends			1
it also requires having a clear plan			0
finally , those with whom the @entity4 is interacting , be they friends or adversaries , have to believe that it has the resolve to follow through -- and the willingness to take materially positive action if things go the way @entity4 wants			2
but a @entity4 that is post-iraq and @entity126 is correctly seen in the @entity89 and elsewhere as " leaning back			2
" a trifecta of forces has contributed to this : the huge costs and damage of our misadventures in the region have left us disinclined to further commit major resources or incur further risks			0
our domestic economic problems have led us to turn inward and question how we allocate our resources			0
and the polarization in @entity4 politics has both produced divisions that make action hard and empowered the extreme wings of both parties , groups that for all their divisions happen to share a taste for isolationism			2
@entity4 inaction in @entity158 , the growing violence in @entity150 , our apparent inclination to get out of @entity152 at any cost , and our relative silence on the decaying situation elsewhere in @entity156 all contribute to the unhelpful perception that we are not going to put our shoulder into much in the region ( or elsewhere for that matter )			2
it 's not that we 'll be absent			0
not that we wo n't issue statements			0
not that we wo n't take some modest actions			0
it 's just that we will do less where we can do less			0
and with each illustration of thisâ € ” whether our restraint is soundly based or notâ € ” we lose credibility and thus leverage			0
this is the hard choice for @entity4 : embrace the risks and costs of real engagement or accept those associated with a much more passive role			1
this does n't mean we have to be foolish			0
we do n't need more iraqs			0
@entity2 's identity torn in two but the lesson of @entity150 was not to never intervene again			2
it was to never do so rashly , recklessly or for the wrong reasons			0
it was to resist the temptation to act alone , to step up to the hard work of real diplomacy , to keep our eye on our nation 's need to be a more effective leader in the international community , rather than simply the bullying hyperpower			0
it was to understand that the trick of leadership is actually getting others to follow , building coalitions , leveraging our power with that of others			0
because as we are now discovering , sometimes the greatest costs of mistakes like the ones we made in @entity150 and @entity152 are the way they limit our ability or inclination to take action in the future when it is truly necessary			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			0

@entity211 : after @entity2 slaughter , @entity4 response was criticized as puny , impotent
he says cutting funds might feel good , but will cede @entity4 leverage to @entity220 nations offering aid
he says real impact requires strong political , economic diplomacy at highest levels
@entity211 : @entity4 has choice : embrace risks of engagement , or be passive , accept less clout
