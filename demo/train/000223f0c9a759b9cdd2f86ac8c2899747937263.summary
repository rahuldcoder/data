-- i 'm 45 , and my son is 7			1
once in a while , i still get carded when i try to buy certain well - guarded cold medicines , so i was taken aback in recent months when two different strangers asked , " is that your grandson ? " i was most surprised by the instant assumption , without an awkward pause or hesitation , as if grandmother was the only option			1
i was 38 when @entity13 was born -- not exactly a young mother , but nowhere near the age i imagine a grandmother to be			1
both incidents took place after i moved from @entity19 to @entity20 , a @entity21 city , and both times i was asked by fellow black women -- one about 21 , and one who was my senior			1
i thought about the incidents when i read a recent @entity0 essay by @entity28 on being mistaken for her daughter 's nanny			2
the essay inspired me to post my case of mistaken grandmother identity on @entity33 , where i got lively responses ranging from " are you kidding ? " to makeover tips			2
had i let too many gray hairs escape my patrol ? maybe the question should n't have surprised me , given the historically high teen birth rates and young grandmothers in the black community , especially in the @entity21			2
but i have since learned about a convergence of birth and child - rearing trends that make it harder to guess whether an over- 40 caretaker is a grandparent or , like me , a more ... er ... " mature " mother			1
first , experts say teenagers are having fewer babies			2
" we believe evidence - based teen pregnancy programs work best , " says @entity52 , the ceo of the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) , founded by @entity54			1
" we also believe in giving the kids hope			2
even with all the education in the world , if they do n't believe their future circumstances are brighter than what they 're seeing , what 's the reason to delay ? " @entity64 had the highest teen birth rate in the nation in 1995 , but currently ranks no. 13 , according to @entity52			0
and recent data shows that @entity64 was one of 10 states -- including @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 -- that had the most dramatic decreases in births to 15 - to 17 - year - olds between 2007 and 2009			1
it 's a national trend			0
according to preliminary data from the @entity79 's @entity78 published this year , the birth rate for teens ages 15 to 19 had reached its lowest point in the nearly 70 years since the data has been tracked			1
black births to teens ages 15 to 17 have plummeted since the 86.1 rate in 1991 , for example , when the @entity89 rate was 69.2 ( per 1,000 women )			1
still , black and @entity89 teenagers still have a much higher birth rate than non-hispanic whites			0
the february report shows that the birth rate per 1,000 teens for black teenagers ages 15 to 17 was 32.1 in 2009 , and even higher at 41 for @entity89 teens -- compared with just 11 for non-hispanic whites			0
if more young people are weighing their life options -- with fewer " babies having babies " -- fewer grandparents are raising their grandchildren , right ? wrong			1
more children are being raised by their grandparents			1
@entity109 data from 2009 , published in july , reports that the percentage of white and @entity89 children being raised by one or both grandparents doubled between 1991 and 2009 , from about 1 % to 2 %			1
about 5 % of black children are raised by a grandparent , a figure the @entity109 says has remained constant since 1991			1
citing the impact of harsh economic times , the @entity117 's latest data from 2008 indicates that 2.9 million children were being raised primarily by their grandparents -- up 8 % from 2000 , and 5 % from 2007			1
@entity117 reports that the number of black grandparents serving as primary caregivers fell 12 % between 2000 and 2008 , but the number of white grandparents spiked 19 %			1
the number of @entity89 grandparents becoming caregivers rose 14 % during that eight - year period			1
according to @entity117 , 53 % of grandparent caregivers are white , 24 % are black , 18 % are @entity89 and 3 % are @entity130			0
" many of these children come to live with their grandparents because of substance abuse or child maltreatment or abandonment , " said dr. @entity131 , associate director for operations at @entity133 , a community outreach research project that @entity135 in @entity20 launched in 1995			1
" you 're entering your late fifties or sixties , and you 're thinking about retiring , settling down , as opposed to gearing up again to raise a family			0
" the project gives grandparent caretakers in eligible counties services for a year , with referrals for financial assistance , housing and health care			1
an average of 60 to 75 grandparent - led families participate a year			1
and there is a waiting list			0
" [ the grandparents ] do n't get a rest , " says child psychologist dr. @entity155 , assistant director of the @entity156			2
she says that 25 % to 30 % of the patients in her private practice are being raised by one or both grandparents			1
" they 've been doing it for 40 years			0
" @entity164 , 57 , who lives outside @entity20 , took responsibility for raising her three grandchildren in 1997 because her daughter had substance abuse problems and was sometimes incarcerated			0
@entity169 , a part - time assistant in a law office , says her daughter and grandchildren were living with her until her daughter left one day			2
" it was too much responsibility for her , " she says			0
@entity169 says two of the three grandchildren also had medical challenges because of a rare blood disorder			0
now , her grandchildren are 23 , 21 and 19 , with the youngest about to start college			0
" some of my friends have young kids , and i have grandkids , " says @entity169 , who got married and had her first child at 16			0
most of my friends , like me , got a much later start			0
and we 're not alone			0
the @entity78 reports that the birth rate for women ages 40 to 44 rose 3 % between 2008 and 2009 -- the only age group to have an increase for that time period			1
women are waiting longer to have children			1
according to a 2009 report from the center , the average age of a mother 's first birth jumped 3.6 years between 1970 and 2006 , from 21.4 years to 25 years			2
for black mothers , the average age rose from 21.7 to 22.7 ; for @entity89 mothers , the average age for a first child rose from 22.4 to 23.1			2
no wonder observers are confused			0
@entity210 stay - at - home mother @entity209 , a writer , experienced age whiplash after her seventh child was born when she was 40			1
until then , a youthful face meant she was carded constantly			0
two weeks after the first time she was n't carded , the bigger shock came in a restaurant : " the woman behind me looked at me and said , ' what a cute baby ! is she your grandbaby ? ' i was speechless for 30 seconds until i realized my mouth was hanging open			0
then i just closed it and said , ' no , she 's my daughter			0
' ... my mother said , ' girls are having babies at 15 , so if you have a baby at 15 , and your child has a baby at 15 or 16 , at 30 you 're a grandmother			0
' i like to think i 'm not old enough to be a grandmother , but since my oldest is 21 , it is possible			0
" my over- 40 - new - mom status might have come as a surprise to observers previously , but regional customs might explain why no one had blurted out the grandmother question before i moved to @entity20			2
until recently , i lived in @entity240			0
" @entity21 black people , to me , treat other black people like family , " says duchess @entity241 , 42 , author of " @entity242 from @entity243 to @entity244			0
" @entity241 and her husband had the last of their three children when she was 37			2
she 's an associate professor of @entity252 at @entity253 in @entity254 , @entity255 , but she was born in @entity256			0
maybe as more mothers wait longer to have children , the question " are you his grandmother ? " eventually will be weighed as carefully as " are you pregnant ? " you ca n't tell in a glance			2
@entity265 is a writer based in @entity20			1
her website is www.tananarivedue.com .			0

@entity265 , 45 , has been asked if her 7 - year - old son is her grandson
many women are having children at a later age
meanwhile , more children are being raised by grandparents
