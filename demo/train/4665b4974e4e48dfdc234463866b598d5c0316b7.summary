@entity0 , @entity1 -- former president @entity3 suggested on saturday that the fall in @entity6 turnout for @entity7 in 2014 was partly due to president @entity9 's decision to not issue an executive order on immigration			1
at a @entity13 event with @entity14 in @entity0 , @entity3 and his former aides reminisced about the past but with a clear eye on how their decisions in the 1990s could be implemented in the future			2
@entity3 also handicapped the disastrous midterms for @entity7			1
" there was a collapse of the youth vote , the @entity23 - @entity22 vote held fairly steady , " @entity3 said			0
" we had a little bit of a loss of the @entity6 vote , perhaps because the president did n't issue the immigration order			1
but it was a tough call for him because had he done so , a lot of others would have lost by even more			0
it was a difficult call			0
" latinos made up 10 % of the electorate in 2012 , according to @entity2 's exit polls			0
in 2014 , that number was 8 %			0
in september , @entity9 decided to postpone issuing an executive action on immigration until after november 's elections because it would be " more sustainable " then			1
@entity3 said the biggest problem for @entity7 -- who lost their majority in the @entity48 and fell deeper into the minority in the @entity50 -- was that " the people who were against us felt more strongly than the people for us			1
" the former president also suggested that a national advertising campaign -- that @entity7 " did n't have " -- on an economic message and other issues could have " made all the difference in a couple of close races			1
" @entity3 's recollections came during a celebration around the 10th anniversary of the @entity64			2
a steady stream of former campaign and administration aides were in town for a weekend that has seemed part reunion , part party and part pep rally for the future			0
for the @entity3 confidants in @entity0 this weekend , that future , while not expressly addressed , is @entity76 's all - but - certain presidential run in 2016			1
@entity76 spoke earlier in the day at an event for the @entity80 's " @entity81 " initiative			0
unlike other events during the week that looked back at the @entity3 administration , the former first lady 's event was forward looking on how to increase women 's participation in the workforce			2
at the @entity13 event , @entity3 looked to the future while talking about the past by arguing that his administration " showed the importance of policy			2
" " we can do this again , " he said to a room full of @entity76 fans .			0
