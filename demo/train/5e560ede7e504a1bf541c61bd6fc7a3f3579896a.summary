-- think back over your favorite blockbusters this year			2
how many of them starred women in leading roles ? chances are , the answer is slim to none			2
in 2014 , women led 18 % of the year 's 50 highest - grossing movies , according to a study by @entity12			1
for every @entity14 in " @entity15 , " there 's " @entity16 , " " captain america : the winter soldier " and " x-men : @entity20 " -- all starring vehicles for ( white ) male actors			0
unfortunately , this disparity is nothing new			0
statistically speaking , male led films have trumped female led films for years			1
in 2013 , men led 80 % of the highest grossing movies released			1
the year before that , male actors dominated the box office by 84 %			1
in 2011 , it was by 88 %			2
yet it 's still women who show up in theaters and fuel box office receipts			2
last year , three out of five of the highest grossing films had female audiences that were higher than male audiences , according to data released by the @entity44			1
" @entity45 : catching @entity47 , " " @entity46 " and " @entity50 " were the three highest grossing films of 2013 that skewed female			1
" @entity53 " and " @entity54 " were the two remaining films that attracted male audiences			2
female film fans " also drive ticket sales for movies that you would n't always expect , " said @entity55 , vice president and chief analyst at @entity12			1
" opening weekend of ' @entity61 , ' for example , more women showed up to the theaters than men			2
" and women do n't only represent in theaters ; they 're also largely behind the social media conversations that drive moviegoers to theaters			1
@entity71 , chairwoman at the @entity72 , said women are responsible for over 60 % of messaging over social media			1
" the female audience is a very enthusiastic , underserved audience			0
we go to see movies with our girlfriends , men and children and we want to tell everyone we know about it , " @entity71 said			0
these social media conversations are not just limited to your regular female moviegoer			1
@entity87 and @entity88 spread the good word about " @entity16 , " which was both male led and the no. 1 grossing movie in the 2014 box office			1
both stars reached well over 1 million @entity95 followers in their posting			0
so women will fill movie theaters and tweet with abandon in support of some of @entity102 's biggest films			1
but for some reason , @entity102 seems incapable of making movies about and starring women			0
there is no easy answer as to why that is , but filmmaker @entity109 believes the problem lies in a lack of strong material for actresses			0
" women ( - led ) films do n't make as much money internationally , but i 've seen the material that 's being generated for women and it 's not that good , " @entity109 said			1
" it 's just missing something character-wise			0
" @entity109 broke new ground with his 2011 hit comedy , " bridesmaids , " which gained unprecedented attention from both men and women			1
the vision was simple : round up some of the industry 's funniest actresses and have them portray what it 's like when different women are thrown together in a bridal party			0
not only did it bring in a ton of money , but many credited it for making enduring headway for women in film			0
@entity109 does not completely agree			0
he said " bridesmaids " opened the door , but not wide enough : " there 's still not enough roles for women in film and it 's distressing			1
" another issue is that the roles that do exist may just feed back into long - held gender stereotypes			0
as @entity151 , a colleague of @entity109 's who co-wrote and starred in " bridesmaids , " told @entity0 , women in film are moving in the right direction if they are not playing " the nagging wife or the crazy neighbor			1
" there seems to be hope on the horizon			0
at the moment , there are two films gaining awards season buzz that are positioning themselves as a step in the right direction : @entity164 's " wild " and @entity166 's " cake			2
" in " cake , " @entity166 stars as a woman suffering from chronic pain and emotional madness , pushing away the ones she loves the most			0
with " @entity180 , " @entity164 plays an unstable , reckless character in search of light at the end of the tunnel after the death of her mother			2
" i feel like the past few years we have seen less of these women on our screen , " said " @entity180 's " producer @entity184 , who longs for strong , iconic characters like those in " @entity187 " ( 1990 ) and " network " ( 1976 )			1
" women are speaking up now for more of what they want to see and they are driving the social conversation			2
" but if we 're ever going to truly close the gap between lead roles for men and women , it will have to be more than the audience demanding for it to happen			0
there would also need to be more filmmakers like @entity109 , who 's made it blatantly clear that he sees no reason to constantly tell movies from a male point of view			0
for his upcoming " @entity208 " reboot , @entity109 has decided on a female cast , a decision that earned him criticism from skeptics			0
despite the flak over social media , @entity109 said he " just wants to level the playing field			1
" after all , he pointed out , " the funniest people i know are women			0

despite steps toward equality , women once again *underrepresented* on screen in 2014
women led 18 % of the highest grossing films of the year
but they make up *significant* numbers in ticket sales , social media conversations
does " cake " or " @entity180 " have what it takes to be the next " bridesmaids " ?
