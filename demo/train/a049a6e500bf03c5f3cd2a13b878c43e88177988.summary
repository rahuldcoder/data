@entity0 -- @entity4 intelligence secretly funneled at least $ 4 million to a @entity0 front group whose leaders improperly lobbied @entity9 officials over the disputed territory of @entity11 , federal agents alleged tuesday			1
a @entity4 - @entity9 man who served as director of the @entity15 is in federal custody , while a second man accused of steering money to the organization is believed to be in @entity4 , the @entity12 said			1
the @entity15 director , @entity25 , " acted at the direction and with the financial support of the government of @entity4 for more than 20 years , " an @entity24 arrest affidavit states			1
one @entity9 congressman quickly gave $ 4,000 donated by the two men charged in the case to charity , while another said he would consider a similar move if the source of the money was in question			1
@entity25 and his co-defendant , @entity35 , have been charged with conspiring to violate the @entity36 , which requires lobbyists acting on behalf of another nation to register with the @entity9 government			1
the charge carries a possible prison term of up to five years			0
short , balding and bespectacled , @entity25 made a brief initial appearance in federal court in the @entity0 suburb of @entity45 , @entity46 , tuesday afternoon			2
he wore a short - sleeved , checked shirt and dark slacks at the hearing , during which no plea was entered			0
@entity9 magistrate judge @entity52 urged @entity25 to get a local attorney to defend him after the defendant told her his lawyer was in @entity56 , @entity57			2
@entity52 set a detention and preliminary hearing for thursday at afternoon			0
the goal of the operation was to tilt @entity9 policy in @entity4 's favor on @entity11 , a @entity64 territory disputed between @entity65 and @entity4 since @entity4 's independence from @entity67 in 1947			1
both nations claim the entire region , which has been divided between them by a @entity72 - monitored cease - fire line			0
the dispute has been the flashpoint in two wars between the nuclear - armed south @entity77 rivals			0
@entity25 was operating as a @entity4 agent as early as 1995 , the @entity24 affidavit states			2
his group organized seminars , lectures and conferences on @entity11 , and @entity25 attended a dinner with members of @entity86 in 2008 , according to the affidavit			0
another longtime @entity24 source said up to 80 percent of @entity25 's public statements are provided by @entity4 's powerful @entity89 " to repeat and disseminate verbatim , " the document states			1
" the other 20 percent of the @entity15 's messaging consists of @entity25 's own ideas , which have been pre-approved by the @entity89 but not provided by them			0
" according to the @entity24 affidavit , federal agents learned of the scheme from an unidentified informant who faced a @entity9 jail term			1
the man told the @entity24 he had helped conceal the source of @entity15 funds , which he said originated with the @entity89			0
the complaint states that @entity35 lined up donors within the @entity9 to contribute to the @entity15 , " in return for repayment of those amounts in @entity4			1
" the informant said the money was transferred to @entity25 's organization via @entity35 , an @entity9 citizen living in @entity4			1
@entity4 has been a @entity9 ally in the battle against the @entity112 terrorist network and the @entity113 in neighboring @entity114			1
but relations between @entity116 and @entity0 have been strained by the @entity9 commando raid that killed @entity112 leader @entity118 in @entity4 and other issues			1
federal campaign contribution records show @entity25 and @entity35 , also a @entity9 citizen , contributed to a number of members of @entity86 between 1998 and 2008			1
the charges specifically link @entity4 funds to two 2004 contributions -- one by @entity35 and one by his nephew as a " straw donor " -- to members of @entity86 identified only as elected officials a and @entity131 based on @entity133 records , " @entity140 " appears to be @entity135 rep. @entity134 of @entity136 , who received a $ 2,000 contribution from @entity35 on the date mentioned in the affidavit			1
he got another $ 2,000 from @entity25 on the same day in september 2004 , those records show			0
@entity134 spokesman @entity142 told @entity1 that the eight - term congressman has made $ 2,000 donations to two non-profits in his @entity147 - area district , the @entity148 and the @entity149 , since news of the charges broke			0
@entity25 , meanwhile , made personal contributions of $ 23,500 , mostly to @entity135 , who controlled @entity86 for most of the period			0
he gave $ 7,500 to @entity135 rep. @entity154 of @entity155 , a self - proclaimed " champion of @entity4 , " between 1997 and 2010 , @entity133 records show			2
in a statement posted on his congressional web site , @entity154 said he was " deeply shocked " by @entity25 's arrest			0
" for as long as i 've known him , dr. @entity25 has been either a permanent legal resident of the @entity9 or a citizen and as such , any political contributions i may have received from dr. @entity25 over the years are completely legal , " @entity154 said			2
he said that in the 20 years he has known @entity161 , " i had no inkling of his involvement with any foreign intelligence operation and had presumed our correspondence was legitimate			2
" " however , " he added , " if there is any doubt about the origin of these contributions , i will donate those funds to the @entity172			0
" the biggest chunk of @entity25 's contributions went to the @entity175 , to which he gave $ 9,500 between 2004 and 2008 , according to the @entity133			2
@entity25 also contributed $ 250 sums to two @entity178 presidential campaigns , former vice president @entity180 's 2000 effort and president @entity182 's 2008 bid			2
the @entity12 said there was no evidence that any elected official who received contributions from @entity25 or the @entity15 knew the money " originated from any part of the @entity4 government			0
" @entity1 's @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
