-- nearly a decade ago , a group of @entity2 and other men from the @entity4 came to the @entity5 to carry out the worst terrorist attack on the @entity5 not a single one had @entity5 citizenship			2
almost nine years after the september 11 attacks , the threat of another major terror strike is still a concern , but where the threat is coming from has changed			0
a growing number of @entity5 citizens and longtime residents of the @entity5 are becoming radicalized enough by @entity19 's extremist ideology to kill their fellow @entity5 , counterterrorism officials say			1
a growing number are also learning the bomb - making skills necessary to become potentially dangerous terrorists , the officials say			0
they are training in the mountains of @entity26 in northwestern @entity27 , where @entity19 still enjoys significant safety			0
that 's where , according to the @entity5 government , alleged @entity33 bomber @entity32 was trained by the @entity27 @entity34 , a group with close ties to @entity19			1
@entity32 's case has strong similarities to that of another @entity5 who plotted with terrorist groups in @entity27 to attack the @entity5			1
his name is @entity42 , a @entity43 convert to @entity44 from @entity45 , @entity46 , who became radicalized , traveled to @entity27 to join up with @entity19 and helped @entity50 's terrorist organization plot a bomb attack on @entity46			1
when news of @entity42 ' arrest broke last summer , family members , friends and terrorism experts where dumbfounded by how a studious , middle - class , baseball - loving , all - american kid and onetime @entity58 recruit could end up plotting to kill in the name of @entity19			0
@entity0 's investigation into @entity42 has resulted in an intimate portrait of a homegrown terrorist , charting the disturbing story of a young @entity5 's obsessive quest to join @entity19			1
watch a preview of ' @entity68 ' @entity42 ' case sheds significant light on why @entity32 and an increasing number of other young @entity5 have become seduced by @entity19 's ideology			1
both @entity42 and @entity32 were well - integrated into @entity5 life before becoming radicalized			1
both traveled to the heart of @entity19 's operational command in @entity27 's tribal region along the border with @entity79			2
and both allegedly met with the most senior leaders of the @entity27 @entity34 in the weeks before allegedly plotting against the @entity5			1
" @entity42 is almost a poster child for the process , the unremarkable nature of the people who might go through this process and , frankly , the potential to link up to @entity19 and the danger that presents , " according to @entity88 , the director of intelligence analysis for the @entity90			0
several top @entity5 counterterrorism officials had the same message : @entity5 radicalized at home and trained in @entity27 represent a new and disturbing threat to the @entity5 homeland			1
the changing face of terrorism " in the 9/11 world and in the immediate aftermath , the theory was and the reality was that a terrorist attack , if it were to occur again on @entity5 soil , would be someone coming from abroad and coming in to the @entity5 , " homeland security secretary @entity98 said			1
" that paradigm has changed , and there are now individuals in the @entity5 , some who have grown up here and are @entity5 citizens			2
... they have n't done anything to violate the law , but yet they have become radicalized to the point of violent extremism and to the point of ... considering coming back to the homeland and conducting an attack of some sort			0
" in the last year , there have been 16 cases of @entity5 or @entity5 residents implicated in @entity126 terrorism , a surge in such cases			0
the @entity33 plot is case no. 17			2
these cases include the plot last september by @entity134 taxi driver @entity133 to conduct multiple suicide bombings on subway cars in @entity46 , an @entity19 plot described by @entity5 officials as the most serious on @entity5 soil since 9/11			1
like @entity42 and alleged @entity33 bomber @entity32 , @entity133 and two associates allegedly received terrorist training in the tribal areas of @entity27			1
" radicalization is definitely on the rise in the @entity5 , " said @entity88 of the @entity90 , adding that there 's " a new wrinkle " to that radicalization : " for years , many of these people almost exclusively sought to fight overseas , [ but ] now , we 're seeing individuals looking to target the @entity5 itself			2
" counterterrorism officials believe that interactive online social media sites and a new generation of charismatic @entity158 - speaking preachers have helped @entity19 and other terrorist groups spread their ideology into the @entity5 like never before			1
but not only radical online preaching has caused increasing concerns			0
@entity0 investigations have revealed that radical preachers are attempting to spread @entity19 's message on the streets of @entity5 cities , including even on @entity33 in @entity46			1
two @entity46 - based groups -- the @entity169 and @entity170 -- have come under particular scrutiny because of their attempts to spread @entity19 's ideology in the @entity5			2
@entity0 investigations have revealed that @entity42 hung out in @entity169 circles in @entity46 before leaving to fight jihad in @entity79			1
@entity5 counterterrorism officials tell @entity0 they believe he was radicalized by spending time with the group			1
while the @entity169 and @entity170 have few full - time members and their public rallies are sometimes sparsely attended , they have thousands of followers online , many of them @entity5			0
and counterterrorism officials believe they often organize meetings in private			1
" in a sense , they are almost bug lights for aspiring jihadists , " @entity88 said			0
" they 've got an @entity189 , anti-democratic , anti- @entity5 , pro-al @entity19 message			0
" one of the followers of @entity170 's website was " @entity193 , " the avatar of @entity193 , a @entity195 woman charged in march for allegedly plotting to murder a @entity197 cartoonist			0
the @entity169 , like @entity170 , is still active			0
last month , outside the @entity200 consulate in @entity46 , it protested @entity5 support for @entity200			0
after the rally , @entity169 spokesman @entity202 said the group planned to step up its activities in @entity46 and was successfully recruiting new followers			0
@entity202 , who said he believed the @entity5 was at war with @entity44 , refused to give his real name			2
breeding ground while it is still unclear whether @entity32 had radical associates in the @entity5 , @entity5 counterterrorism officials are concerned that others like him may be being radicalized through personal contact with proselytizers			1
most serious plots directed at the @entity215 in the last six years saw plotters either trained or directed by established jihadist groups in @entity27 , according to a recent study conducted for the @entity219			2
in recent months , videos have emerged purporting to show two @entity5 fighting with militants along the @entity79 - @entity27 border			2
one of the alleged @entity5 , going by the name @entity224 , was featured with his face blurred in a video produced by the propaganda arm of the @entity229 , an @entity19 - affiliated @entity230 group			0
in the video , @entity224 said he was not the only @entity5 who had joined up with militants in the area			0
he also made a plea in @entity158 for new recruits to fight @entity5 forces in @entity79			0
" we must rush to the lands to jihad			0
it is an obligation on us , " he said			0
" how can we lose when we wish for death ? " but it 's what happens when fighters like @entity224 come home that most worries @entity5 counterterrorism officials .			1

more americans are turning to radical @entity44 , @entity5 counterterrorism officials say
homeland security secretary : this is a " paradigm shift " since the days just after 9/11

his case is similar to that of @entity42 , subject of @entity0 's " @entity68 "
