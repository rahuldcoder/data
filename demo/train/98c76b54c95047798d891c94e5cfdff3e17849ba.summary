@entity0 -- a @entity3 high school sports team is not scoring any points for its name , the @entity6			1
in a letter this month , the @entity7 accused @entity9 of stereotyping and demanded a name change			0
the group also is seeking a change of the school mascot			1
the group said it was " shocked to learn that the @entity6 " is the official mascot of the high school in @entity18			1
" continued use of the ' @entity6 ' mascot perpetuates demeaning stereotypes of @entity6 and @entity23 , " it said			1
" @entity9 's gross stereotyping can not be tolerated			1
" the school has a mascot that " depicts a man with a large nose , heavy beard , and wearing " a traditional head covering , the group said			1
during halftime , " a female dressed as belly dancer entertains the mascot by dancing for him , " it added			0
but for the school , the mascot and cheerleaders shouting " @entity39 , let 's go " are nothing new			1
the mascot dates back to the 1930s			1
@entity45 superintendent @entity44 says he is taking the concerns seriously			0
he believes his school district and the civil rights group can come to a compromise by altering the mascot 's caricature and removing features that insult @entity6 - @entity53			1
" it 's not so much the name but the depiction of the mascot , " @entity44 said			1
" i 'm from @entity58 , @entity59 , so i understand how people can look at different symbols and caricatures			0
i look at it as an educational opportunity for our students and staff to discuss it			0
" things evolve over time , and it 's the 21st century and it 's 2013 , and this group feels we need to look at it and we will , " @entity44 said			2
the @entity6 mascot recognizes the influences of the @entity76 in the area 's date farming , said @entity79 , president of the @entity80 and a 1959 graduate of the high school			1
in the early 1900s , the @entity53 @entity83 acquired date shoots from @entity85 and other middle eastern countries and used them to establish date orchards in the valley 's desert climate , @entity79 said			1
some of the valley 's @entity23 -- largely of @entity92 background -- were involved in date farming , but they mostly ran men 's apparel stores and groceries , @entity79 said			2
by 1921 , the valley held its first date festival in @entity100 , and people who dressed in @entity103 style were admitted free to the festival , he said			0
the @entity105 now attracts 300,000 people over 10 days every february , said @entity79 , a former board member of the @entity107			2
dates became a boon to the valley more than 90 miles east of downtown @entity0			0
the @entity107 , a popular winter retreat that includes @entity112 , now produces 95 % of the country 's dates in two dozen varieties , @entity79 said			1
@entity76 influences are also reflected in community names of @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			1
the city of @entity107 has street names of @entity123 and @entity124 , and the valley 's largest city , @entity100 , has a street named @entity128 , a date variety , @entity79 said			1
by 1931 , the high school adopted the mascot name of @entity6 , replacing the informal names of " date pickers " or " farmers " inspired by the area 's industry			1
it was a common way of nicknaming communities then , much like the @entity139 , @entity79 said			0
" we 're proud of @entity6 tradition and @entity6 culture , " @entity79 said			2
the high school band and drill team dresses in @entity6 style , and a girl in a genie costume dances during football halftimes , @entity79 said			2
@entity79 wants the school to keep the @entity6 mascot , but he 's willing to change the facial features , he said			1
" the comment they make is that it has a hook - nose @entity6			2
we have been using the snarling face to instill fear in the opponent			0
that 's what a mascot does			2
but we can put a handsome dude in the mascot , " @entity79 said			0
he noted how the community stood up for arabs shortly after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			0
do n't come off like we 're something terrible			0
when 9/11 came , we got terrible , terrible threats to change the name of our mascot			0
we said no. " people love the name ; they love the culture ; they love our date festival , " he added			0
the school district and the national group are meeting to see whether a resolution can be made , the affiliate reported			0
the issue will also be discussed at a board meeting november 21			0
superintendent @entity44 will brief the board in closed session on the potential legal implications of the mascot , but he expects there will be many public comments during the open board meeting , he said			2
it is unclear whether anything will change before the next game friday night			0
