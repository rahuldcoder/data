-- tennis bosses have told the sport 's stars that a boycott of the @entity5 over prize money would not be backed			1
players have voiced concerns over the disparity between the money earned by stars who reach the latter stages of grand slams and those who exit in the early rounds			1
@entity17 newspaper the @entity15 reported that they were planning to start a rebel event , possibly in @entity19 , if pay is not increased for the @entity22 tournament in january			0
but the @entity23 , which represents the interests of male players , has denied it would help players in organize any such action			2
" the @entity23 has been clear and repetitive in telling players that it will not organize a boycott , " it said in a statement			2
" instead , @entity32 and players have taken a diplomatic approach this year with the grand slams to address player compensation issues			1
" the grand slams are important events that generate significant revenues , and the players who perform there should share in an acceptable percentage of those revenues like they do on the @entity23 @entity23			1
" how ' @entity44 ' earned a pay rise for tennis colleagues the @entity47 , held in @entity22 every january , is one of four grand slams in tennis -- along with the @entity51 and @entity52 and @entity53			1
in 2012 , first - round losers at the year 's first major tournament were given $ 21,600 , compared to $ 22,500 in @entity51 and $ 23,000 in the @entity56 and @entity17 -- the latter three having increased by 20 %			1
the biggest disparity is in @entity58 , which has the highest prize purse and biggest winner 's check of almost $ 2.4 million			1
" we are pleased that the discussions initiated by the @entity23 with each of the grand slams this year have resulted in certain prize money increases for players in 2012 , " the men 's ruling body said			1
" we remain focused on our active dialogue with these events about player compensation for 2013 and beyond			0
the players remain unified and passionate about this issue			0
" @entity47 boss @entity74 , in @entity75 for the @entity76 which began on monday , attempted to quell boycott fears			0
" we are the first to say that for tennis to be a viable career , the top 250 players need to make a good living , " he told @entity58 news agency @entity78			0
" the top 250 players in tennis make about a quarter of the amount of money in tennis as they do in golf			2
so that could be a good benchmark for us			0
and the @entity91 's prize money has increased more than the @entity23 's has , so we have to address that too			2
" our relationship with the playing group is very , very strong			0
it 's in everyone 's interests ( not to strike )			0
we 're very confident that whatever needs to be resolved will be			0
