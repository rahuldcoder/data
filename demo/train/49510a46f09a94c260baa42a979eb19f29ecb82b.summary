@entity1 , @entity0 -- the super-yachts of the super-rich could soon become super-green			0
the solar sail : super-yachts could cut fuel consumption and emissions by using a sail similar to this			1
@entity11 - based technology company @entity10 is working on a " solar sail " which could act as both a sail and a solar power source to all sorts of large vessels			1
super-yachts owned by billionaires like @entity20 owner @entity19 and @entity22 co-founder @entity21 are currently among the biggest fuel guzzlers on the planet			2
some of the ocean - going beasts like @entity28 's " @entity27 , " the biggest private super-yacht in the world , are over 150 meters long and contain amenities like aircraft hangars , movie theaters , @entity34 , and swimming pools			0
all of these features sap incredible amounts of energy			0
fuel consumption estimates on super-yachts have ranged up to one liter of fuel per second when traveling at high power			1
see a photo gallery of the world 's best super-yachts @entity10 's ceo @entity46 told @entity2 the technology could work perfectly with super-yachts			1
he said the solar sails had the ability to significantly reduce the boats ' fuel consumption and greenhouse - gas emissions			1
" we think it would enable people to have their super-yacht but make little or no carbon footprint , which is the big problem with these vessels , " he said			0
@entity46 said the technology worked by using a wing that is a solar panel or a sail , pivotally mounted to a vessel so it can be angled to the sun or the wind			2
the " sails " are controlled by a computer which takes into account the direction and strength of sun and wind to optimize energy collection			2
a design project is currently underway in the @entity75 to create a solar sail for the super-yachts , he said			0
@entity46 said the company was working with @entity80 shipping company @entity79 to get solar sails on some of its fleet			1
" our aim is for a trail of retrofitted sails to one bulker and one tanker in 2010			0
based on the results of this , then we would design ' new - build ' vessels , " he said			0
@entity46 estimated the sail could save about 5 percent in fuel consumption from the solar power and another 20 to 40 percent from wind power when the vessel is traveling at 18 knots			1
" this might add up to a 10 percent saving overall in the whole journey , " @entity46 said			0
he said there were further hopes that the technology could be improved by developing systems to raise and lower sails with fewer moving parts and store energy more efficiently .			2

solar sails are large solar - paneled wings which can *harness* sun or wind power
@entity11 - based company @entity10 is developing the technology
the solar sails could be fixed to super-yachts to help reduce their fuel consumption
