-- the sudden responsibility of leadership is resting well on @entity4 's shoulders and it needed a captain 's knock from him to lift @entity7 to a respectable 259 for five wickets after day one of the @entity9 in @entity10			1
@entity4 passed 1,000 @entity9 runs for the year on the way to an undefeated 72 not out to send the majority of the huge 70,000 crowd at the @entity14 home happy			1
@entity16 was on 23 not out at stumps			0
@entity4 only took over from injured regular @entity7 skipper @entity18 for the second test in @entity20 , which the home side won in four days to take a 2 - 0 lead in the best of four match series			1
many expected the experienced @entity16 to be elevated , but instead the selectors opted for the 25 - year - old @entity4 and he has repaid their faith			2
he scored his second century of the series in @entity20 and is well set for a third in @entity10 when the match resumes on the second day			0
@entity18 , injured his troublesome back and hamstring during the first test in @entity33 , determined to play to honor his great friend and teammate @entity34 , who died after a freak accident in a match in @entity38 at the end of november			0
@entity18 , @entity4 and @entity40 all scored centuries in the emotion charged match , which had to be delayed following @entity34 ' death and funeral			2
@entity40 , who has also hit 1,000 test runs in the calendar year , did not add a single run to that tally friday , dismissed by @entity51 paceman @entity50 for a duck			0
@entity53 and @entity54 rallied the home side with a dogged 115 - run stand but both were dismissed in a five - minute spell after lunch			1
@entity60 ( 32 ) and debutant @entity61 ( 13 ) both made starts but were unable to capitalize , leaving @entity4 , with good support from @entity16 , to take @entity7 to the close in a respectable position			1
@entity50 and fellow paceman @entity66 both ended with two wickets for @entity68 , which has not won a test at the @entity14 for 33 years			1
the tradition of starting test matches in @entity7 on @entity9 dates back to 1974 , when arch - rival @entity72 was the tourist			1
in the 40 years since , it has proved to be a popular move , with vast crowds coming to the @entity14 in festive mood			0
last year saw a world record crowd of over 91,000 pack the ground as @entity7 was on its way to inflicting a humbling 5 - 0 defeat on @entity72 in the @entity84			0
test cricket matches , the longest form of the game and lasting five days , also started on @entity9 between @entity88 and @entity89 in @entity90 and @entity91 and the @entity92 in @entity93			0
like at the @entity14 , @entity88 's match had an added poignancy following a tragedy , with the @entity97 being used for the first time since @entity90 was struck by a deadly earthquake in 2011 , which claimed 185 lives			0
@entity103 skipper @entity102 marked the occasion with a stunning 195 off just 134 balls to lift the home side to a dominant 429 for seven wickets at stumps on the first day .			2

honors even after first day of @entity9 at @entity14
@entity7 259 for five wickets at stumps against @entity68
captain @entity4 undefeated on 72
@entity53 and @entity54 also hit half centuries
