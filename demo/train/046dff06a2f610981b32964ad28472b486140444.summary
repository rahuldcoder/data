-- ever caught a glimpse of the secretive @entity3 lynx ? or heard the croaking bark of a mediterranean monk seal ? @entity7 foxes are trapped and skinned for the pelts			1
if not , and you want to do so , you had better hurry because pollution and habitat degradation have pushed both species to the brink of extinction			1
according to a recent study by the @entity18 - based @entity17 ( @entity17 ) human activity is threatening almost one - sixth of @entity21 's total land mammal population			1
among marine mammals the situation is even more grave , with some 22 percent of total numbers being pushed towards annihilation			1
the @entity17 's recently published @entity26 identified 17 @entity21 mammal species that are " vulnerable , " seven that are " endangered , " and six that are " critically endangered			1
" the mediterranean monk seal population , for example , has now dwindled to just 350 - 450 individuals			1
the outlook for the @entity3 lynx is even worse , with only an estimated 150 still surviving , making it the most endangered cat species on earth			1
other species on the critically endangered list include the @entity7 fox , @entity41 pine vole , @entity21 mink and @entity43			1
" this new assessment proves that many @entity21 mammals are declining at an alarming rate , " said @entity17 director - general @entity44 , a position echoed by the @entity47 's environment commissioner @entity46			1
" the results of the report highlight the challenge we currently face to halt the loss of @entity21 's biodiversity , " said @entity46			1
" it is clear that the full implementation of the @entity59 ( adopted by the @entity47 in 1992 to safeguard @entity21 's endangered wildlife ) is of the utmost importance to protect @entity21 's native mammals			1
" @entity21 is home to a rich diversity of native mammal species ranging from the small such as shrews and voles , to the large such as wolves and brown bears			1
to the enormous -- in the case of the 70 - ton @entity43			1
human activity , however , especially in the form of agriculture , deforestation , hunting and pollution , has reduced the numbers of these species , leaving many of them in danger of vanishing			1
the aforementioned @entity59 -- a corollary of the 1979 @entity83 -- introduced a range of measures aimed at protecting endangered species ( including plants , birds and fish as well as mammals )			1
that directive has certainly had an effect , with a number of mammals that previously seemed destined to disappear from @entity21 now enjoying something of a revival			1
the @entity100 , for example , was almost hunted out in the 19th century , its population reduced to just a small group of survivors in @entity104 's @entity103			1
thanks to extensive conservation and protection efforts , however , the species is once again flourishing and has been downgraded to the " least concern " category on the @entity17 's " @entity110			2
" it is the same story for the @entity21 bison , which was limited to just a few zoos before re-introduction programs across eastern @entity21 helped re-build the population to current levels of around 1,800			2
" the fate of the @entity21 bison provides an example of the way in which a species may be brought to the brink of extinction in a very short time , and then saved only through great efforts , " said dr. @entity118 of @entity120 's @entity119			2
" the saving of the bison has been an undoubted success , although further action will continue to be essential			2
" dr. @entity133 , deputy head of the @entity17 's @entity134 , agrees that significant progress has been made			2
" in @entity21 we now have a network of protected areas , as well as strong conservation laws , " he told @entity0			2
" it is possible for species to recover even when their numbers drop to extinction level			2
" both the @entity100 and @entity21 bison are recovering well because of appropriate conservation measures			2
" the @entity21 beaver is another example			2
it was persecuted almost to extinction but has now been re-introduced and is colonizing all over the continent			2
" while there are positive stories , however , the overall picture remains a disheartening one , as the @entity26 demonstrates			0
commissioned by the @entity156 and a year in the drafting , it is the first such overview of its kind and draws on the work of a @entity21 - wide group of scientists , zoologists and conservationists			0
its findings provide an unequivocal picture of biodiversity loss and species decline			0
habitat destruction , usually due to agricultural practices , is the key driver of that decline , although many other factors are involved , including pollution , disease and the introduction of invasive foreign species			0
the case of the @entity21 mink , one of the @entity17 's six critically endangered @entity21 mammals , is an example of how different elements can combine to drive a particular species to the brink of destruction			0
once found in great numbers across @entity21 from @entity189 to the @entity190 , the mink population has plummeted in recent years			0
while hunting has certainly contributed to this decline , the main causes have been habitat loss and competition from invasive foreign species , according to @entity133			0
" the mink is freshwater dependent , " explains @entity133			0
" the more you damage its habitat by polluting rivers , or channeling them , or building dams , the more the population declines			0
" the introduction of the @entity205 mink into @entity21 for fur - rearing also proved disastrous , with some of those mink escaping from captivity , establishing their own colonies in the wild and setting up direct competition for food and resources with the native population			0
the result : an 80 percent decline in that population in the last decade alone ( in 1993 the @entity17 only classified it as " vulnerable " )			0
but experts say that species loss can be reversed			1
" there is more and more perception across @entity21 that biodiversity conservation is crucially important , " says @entity133			0
" and we are seeing good recoveries in some species			0
" the picture in the mammal world is not nearly as bad as , say , among freshwater fish , where the number of threatened species is far , far higher			0
" at the same time , the latest figures remain a source of considerable concern			1
at a time when so many conservation initiatives and laws are already in operation , the population of many @entity21 mammal species is in apparent free fall			0
it is not simply the possibility of losing a particular species that worries experts , but also how the loss will affect the species ' wider ecosystem " the food web is extremely complex , " says @entity133			1
" if you lose one element that has a very specific role in that web , it has a knock - on effect and the whole system is threatened			0
" it is very worrying			0
some people think it is a disaster if a famous painting is lost in a fire , but that is just the work of a few weeks or months			0
these species and systems are the product of millions of years of evolution			0
" i am biased , of course , but i think it would be an absolute tragedy if we lost these native species			0

only an estimated 150 @entity3 lynx remain
human activity is endangering many *animals*
experts say situation is *redeemable*
