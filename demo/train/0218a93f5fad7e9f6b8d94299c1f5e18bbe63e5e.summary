@entity0 ? on january 7 , @entity8 , the head of the powerful @entity9 of the @entity10 , reportedly announced that the government would " stop using " the system , in which roughly 160,000 people are detained for up to four years without trial for " crimes that are not severe enough to warrant a criminal sentence , " by the end of 2013			1
after media outlets confirmed the news with officials who attended the meeting @entity23 spoke at , the original articles reporting the decision vanished from the @entity24			0
a subsequent @entity26 news story watered down @entity23 's statement , committing the government only to " advancing reforms " of @entity7 -- which is old news -- a long - stated but never - implemented goal			1
this episode highlights three realities of @entity3 's human rights situation : 1 ) the news is often not what it initially appears to be , especially if a key government decision is at stake ; 2 ) the new leadership is struggling to reply adequately to growing popular demand for reform ; and 3 ) changes to @entity7 , like other long - mooted reforms , might only be a cosmetic gesture , leaving intact laws and practices that violate domestic and international human rights standards			1
@entity3 's new leaders have come to power during a serious legitimacy crisis , with a nation eager for political reforms			1
indeed , party chief @entity50 has repeatedly vowed to " deepen reform			0
" at the same time , there has been rising public discontent over local officials ' abuse of @entity7 to muzzle ordinary people seeking justice or criticizing the government			1
the system was further discredited by the recent detentions of @entity60 , a mother seeking redress for the rape of her young daughter , and @entity65 , a village official who posted negative comments online about the government			0
meanwhile , the main obstacle to abolishing @entity7 , the @entity68 , which holds the unchecked power to detain individuals in these facilities , has seen its political clout diminished under the new leadership arrangement			2
the time for abolition of @entity7 appears ripe , but it 's unclear whether @entity50 is ready to move from talking about reforms to delivering them			1
as a type of arbitrary detention , @entity7 should not be reformed : it should be abolished outright			1
the tepid @entity26 announcement promising to " reform " @entity7 suggests that instead of abolition , the government will merely tinker at the margins of the existing system			2
fears this might be the case derive from the august 2012 announcement of a pilot scheme in four cities			0
few details are available , except that the name of the system was revised from re-education to " @entity97 , " and minor constraints on the police 's ability to impose these punishments were established			0
the debate in and outside of @entity3 this week echoes the 2003 debate about the abolition of " @entity105			2
" this system of administrative detention was designed to detain individuals found outside of their official location of residence ( hukou )			2
it was similarly discredited and abolished after a series of abuses , the last straw being the beating and death of a young man in a @entity105 center in @entity120 in march 2003			0
the decision to get rid of the system was made at the beginning of the then - new leadership of @entity125 and @entity126 , and was perceived as a signal of reform			0
yet the failure to match the end of @entity105 with a wholesale prohibition on arbitrary detention mitigated the benefits of its abolition			1
migrant workers who had been prey for the system benefited from its abolition , but local governments soon found new ways to deal with the other category of people detained in @entity105 and repatriation centers -- petitioners			1
illegal and ad hoc " black jails " were set up to prevent them from trying to reach higher authorities to denounce local official misconduct			0
the central government tolerates the existence of these patently unlawful black jails , demonstrating that it continues to lack commitment to ending arbitrary detention			1
swapping one system of arbitrary detention for another would be a missed opportunity for the new leadership			1
real change requires that the government abolish @entity7 , and establish in its place a new system to punish minor crimes that is consistent with the @entity163 as well as its international human rights obligations , and pass the necessary legislation during the next @entity166 in march			2
the judiciary -- not the police -- should be responsible for considering charges , determining guilt , and assigning appropriate punishment			0
people who are accused must have the ability to confront and question their accusers , the right to counsel , and all fair trial guarantees			0
anything short of this will not quench the public 's thirst for the " deepening reform			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			0

@entity3 media recently said infamous *'re* - education through @entity6 ' system would be reformed
@entity190 : roughly 160,000 people are detained in @entity3 for up to four years without trial
@entity184 : like other long - mooted reforms , this might only be a cosmetic gesture
as a type of arbitrary detention , @entity7 should not be reformed , it should be abolished , she says
