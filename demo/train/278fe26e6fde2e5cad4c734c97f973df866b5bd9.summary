-- who could 've ever predicted that 140 characters could screw up so many people 's lives ? but that 's exactly what has happened to politicians , executives , government staff and others because of their comments on @entity12			1
this social media platform has morphed from a fun place to an information hub to a career killer			2
and astoundingly , even people who work in @entity18 -- you know , the folks who are supposed to advise clients on how to avoid social media disasters -- can tweet out statements that cause a media uproar			1
we saw that this weekend when @entity26 -- who at that time was a @entity18 executive -- tweeted shortly before her 12 - hour flight to @entity28 on friday : " going to @entity28			1
hope i do n't get @entity29			1
i 'm white ! " those 64 characters tweeted by @entity26 resulted in her now being known as " ex-pr executive			1
" @entity26 was fired by @entity32 , the media company headed by @entity33 , within hours of landing in @entity28			1
the lesson here is clear : just because you say " just kidding " or " lol " after your statement does n't mean you wo n't get canned for your tweet			1
@entity26 apologized sunday : " for being insensitive to this crisis -- which does not discriminate by race , gender or sexual orientation , but which terrifies us all uniformly -- and to the millions of people living with the virus , i am ashamed			1
" of course , not every @entity12 mistake ends a career			0
some just result in embarrassment or an avalanche of mocking tweets			1
for example , recently the @entity53 tweeted : " today we remember @entity56 ' bold stand and her role in ending racism			0
" the @entity53 's intent was to commemorate the anniversary of @entity56 ' refusal to move to the back of a segregated bus in 1955			0
but instead , the tweet set off a firestorm with people ridiculing the @entity53 for suggesting that racism had ended in @entity68			1
consequently , the @entity53 was compelled to tweet out a clarification			1
the paradox of @entity12 is that it 's really easy to use and it 's just as easy to screw up			0
so in an effort to help people avoid the pitfalls that have caught so many others , here are some tips for you to keep in mind before you press " send " on that next tweet			1
proofread your tweets sounds simple enough , right ? but since we all tweet in a hurry , we often send out typos			1
one of the worst typos was made by @entity88 senior adviser @entity87 , who put out a tweet that accidentally included the n - word			1
( he was trying to tweet the word " bigger			1
" ) of course , he deleted that tweet and apologized			1
but a quick proofread would 've prevented this			0
racist tweets = unemployment this should be a no - brainer , but then again so should proofreading tweets			2
nothing on @entity12 stays anonymous forever okay , you 're not an idiot			2
you know enough not to badmouth your employer or co-workers on your personal @entity12 account			0
so you create a fake @entity12 account			0
genius , right ? ! well , just ask @entity111 , a former senior @entity112 staffer who did just that			0
@entity111 created an anonymous @entity12 account and leveled criticism at co-workers and even his superiors			0
he was discovered and fired			2
honestly , how can a guy who works with the @entity112 not realize that the @entity112 could figure out who he was ? ! 4			0
you ca n't really delete tweets sure , there 's a delete button on @entity12 , but once it 's out there , simply put : you 're screwed			1
for example , earlier this year the spokesman for rep. @entity127 tweeted out on the congressman 's official @entity12 account : " me likey broke girls , " in reference to the @entity133 show " 2 @entity134			0
" the spokesman quickly deleted the tweet , but a short time later the congressman deleted the spokesman from his staff			2
you do n't have to be famous to get fired for a tweet having a lower - level job and only a few @entity12 followers does n't translate into immunity from being canned for a tweet			1
that 's the lesson a young guy who worked at a food truck in @entity147 discovered the hard way			0
in his case , a big group from a local company ordered food but did n't leave a tip. a few minutes later the employee took to his personal @entity12 account to mock the people who had stiffed him and mentioned their company by name			2
how many @entity12 followers did he have ? about 300			0
but two days later he was fired for ridiculing customers			2
even jokes can get you fired i 'm a comedian , and i 've been subjected to numerous attacks for my jokes on @entity12 -- usually from people who say they are offended that i mock their conservative icons			1
that comes with the territory of being a comedian			0
but there 's a line that comedians can cross which will actually get you fired			2
comedian @entity176 found out exactly where that line was drawn after he tweeted a series of jokes seemingly mocking the victims of the @entity182 tsunami in 2011			0
@entity176 apologized , but that was n't enough for insurance giant @entity184			0
he was fired from his gig as the voice of the @entity184 duck			2
do n't confuse sending a direct message with tweeting this is an easy mistake to make -- just ask former rep. @entity190			2
direct messages go to one person and are private like an e-mail			0
@entity190 's problem occurred when he intended to send a photo of himself in his underwear via direct message to one woman			0
turns out he accidentally sent the photo to everyone on @entity12			0
if still in doubt about a tweet , try the " @entity205 ! " app this app will rate your tweet to give you a sense of whether you will be fired for sending it out			1
while not foolproof , it can be helpful			0
hopefully , these eight suggestions will help you better navigate @entity12 without losing your job			0
of course , there will always be people who get fired for using @entity12 inappropriately			1
but the upside is that without a job , they will have more time to think before they tweet			2
it 's just too bad that they did n't do that earlier			0
