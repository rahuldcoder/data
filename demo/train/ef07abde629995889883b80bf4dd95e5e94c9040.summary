and one of life 's eternal questions , " who will fill these @entity2 ? " it 's @entity4 's time to shine , so do n't even think about trying to plow him over , @entity16 ! speaking of freshness , @entity17 showed up			1
they 'd found him living in the boiler room under @entity22 's @entity21 ( the @entity23 ; sorry , @entity24 ) and he was more than happy to come sit in a little room off to the side and drop little truth pellets all over the @entity28			2
i 've missed him and the way my stupid @entity32 program auto - corrects his name to " iodine			2
" @entity17 gave more frank and succinct criticism of the kiddies over a few minutes of edited commentary than the judges have doled out all season			1
on @entity42 : " what he needs is a coach			2
" on @entity45 : " @entity44 too kitschy for me , way too cabaret			1
not gon na make it on this show like that			2
" @entity45 : " not ready for primetime			1
" @entity45 : " beautiful tune , nice tone , but she lost the plot			1
" and my favorite , @entity17 on @entity45 : " supposedly he has a large black woman trapped in his body			1
as of right now , he 's not pulling them both off			2
" someone had to say it			2
@entity17 only lost me a little when he compared @entity45 to a cheesy @entity61 and called @entity63 's intentions into question			1
just because the kid has a sense of humor does n't mean he thinks the show is named " american comedian			2
" everyone knows it 's named " @entity72			2
" @entity63 would n't be in the @entity73 if he could n't actually get through to people while the music 's on			2
so here they are -- your @entity77 ! @entity79 : @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity63 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 wild cards : @entity90 ( @entity8 's choice ) , @entity92 ( @entity94 's hugmonster ) , and @entity95 ( @entity97 's 17 - year - old spirit animal ) the six wild card contestants had to " sing for their lives " while their nine devastated compadres had to sit around , playing dead			1
up first : @entity45 on the @entity103 ' " @entity102			1
" maybe they showed too much of her too soon			2
i 'd been really excited about @entity45 heading into this week , but the magic was gone			1
i agreed with @entity17 that @entity45 should have stayed miles away from @entity72 on wednesday and this last performance of hers seemed just as desperate in terms of what he called " vocal pyrotechnics			1
" she changed much more of both melodies than she needed to			0
it 's always a fine line on @entity115 -- wanting to make something your own vs. going too far			0
i realize that @entity92 was a mostly personal / emotional choice for @entity94 , but i ai n't mad at her because i love watching people cry , and because his high notes on @entity125 's " i know you wo n't " sounded perfect to me even through the tears			0
if @entity92 is as popular with the other singers as he seems , i think he 's a good one to have around during these first few weeks			0
it 's always better when the cast can be at ease with each other -- and have you heard @entity132 gives the best hugs ? " something 's going through your body right now , " suggested @entity4 as @entity92 shook with emotion after his performance			0
if this was @entity4 's way of begging for a hug , he should consider being more direct			0
@entity141 , quick ! not so tender was @entity45 , who nearly knocked @entity4 over in her excitement to be called back into the spotlight , which is where @entity45 belongs			1
" that 's just @entity45 , " she said of @entity144			1
" putting a twist on old classics			0
" @entity148 , @entity45 ? right			1
anyway , moments after @entity17 had bitched about there being " too many @entity72 wannabes , " @entity45 launched right into @entity72 's " @entity152			1
" [ aside : ] i tend to have no shame regarding the way i live , and have generally adopted a " sucks to be you " attitude toward my neighbors when it comes to my tv habits			0
i 'm sorry the apartment walls are thin , but we 're all paying rent here and i 'm just trying to do my job , you know ? in all my years of recapping embarrassing reality television , @entity45 's performance marks one of the few times i 've ever actually turned my television way , way , way down -- not , like , as a courtesy to the @entity174 delivery guy ( that 's normal ) but as a way to save face from strangers passing in the night			1
i could hear that someone was about to walk by outside , and i suddenly could n't bear the thought of him or her thinking i might have chosen to listen to " @entity152 " ... like this			0
[ / end of aside			0
] against all odds , the blessed @entity97 was honest with @entity45			1
" i heard you nail it			0
a little pitchy in some spots in the turnaround			0
i just did n't hear it this time , i 'm sorry baby			0
" it took him three sentences to twist his gist from lie to truth , but he did it			0
i 'm proud of him			0
you could tell @entity95 was a shoo - in for the wild card before he 'd even begun " @entity198 " -- pretty much because of his hair			1
you just can not not put that hair in the @entity201 when the hair - owner in question also has this super-high , very pure voice which , as of yet , he has no idea how to handle			0
the vocal coaches will help him , and he 'll either figure it out in the near future or he 'll crash and burn like the fire @entity45 never quite set to the rain			1
@entity42 is an adorable , sweaty , unpredictable sweetheart and i love not knowing what crazy hairography or misguided vocal gymnastics he 'll try to pull off next			0
yes ! after getting sacked with having to sing second of 12 girls wednesday night , @entity90 got her second chance and went all out in her purple bridesmaid shift on @entity222 's " @entity221			1
in fact , i 'd comment on this performance the same way as @entity17 commented on her showing from wednesday : " she has music in her blood , and great restraint -- something the show needs more of , not less			1
" @entity90 did n't need to twist this song into a wretched balloon animal of @entity222 in order to prove she was the one to bring in as a finalist			0
singing it solidly was enough			0
i 'm not sure it 'll be enough to keep her in much longer ; i 'm just glad we 'll get to hear her voice another time			0
she does need a big performance next week -- and better placement			0
finally , the judges called for @entity45			1
do it , @entity45 ! sing @entity72 's " @entity250 " the way it was meant to be self - indulgently cackled and scatted ! no , mr. @entity45 gave @entity72 ( and @entity8 , whose favorite word is " @entity72 " ) a break by self - indulgently cackling and scatting his way through @entity256 ' " @entity255			1
" eliminated : @entity45 , @entity45 , @entity45 , @entity45 , @entity45 , @entity45 , @entity45 , @entity45 , @entity45 , @entity45 , @entity45 , @entity45 i 'm fairly happy about this @entity201			1
i 'm extremely happy about a @entity258 press release i just received that informs me that @entity95 " makes @entity261 costumes for a living " and that @entity82 " loves old couples			0
" who does n't ? ! i 'm making a @entity261 costume right now ! ( in @entity266 ; you ca n't see it until it 's perfect			0
) also , @entity81 " can rap , " y'all			0
next week the girls will don all - new pageant gowns to sing @entity272 , while the guys will try out @entity274			2
if @entity42 can just make his hair look even prettier than usual and get permission to sing " @entity277 ( if @entity63 really loves me )			2
