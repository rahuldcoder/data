-- @entity3 president @entity2 must speak out and declare that some of the behavior of the clerical regime in @entity7 is unacceptable , former @entity2 administration official @entity1 said monday			1
@entity1 , who served as an adviser in the @entity9 last year and is now at the @entity10 , told @entity0 's @entity11 the @entity3 must also be open to negotiating some sort of deal to limit @entity7 's nuclear ambitions			1
" you can have negotiations with @entity7 , as the @entity3 has had negotiations with many adversarial countries while also at the same time disapproving on the internal practices of those regimes , " he said			1
@entity1 's comments came just over a week after the bloodiest clashes between pro-democracy protesters and government security forces in months , clashes that left at least eight people dead			1
days after those clashes , hundreds of thousands of pro-government demonstrators held rallies in @entity29 and other cities			0
those protests coincided with new tensions over @entity7 's nuclear program , a program the @entity3 says is intended to build a nuclear weapon			1
@entity29 insists its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes alone and says it 's up to the @entity38 to decide whether to accept @entity7 's proposals on further enriching its uranium			1
@entity3 secretary of state @entity41 said monday the @entity3 remains open to the possibility of further negotiations with @entity29 , despite @entity7 's refusal to make significant progress towards a deal before january 1 this year , as @entity2 has demanded			1
@entity47 told reporters the @entity3 is holding discussions with its partners and like - minded nations about possible new sanctions and other forms of pressure			2
@entity1 said he expects the @entity3 and its allies will try to ratchet up economic pressure on @entity7 , targeting in particular the @entity57 and its business interests			1
" so you will begin to see intensification of economic pressure on @entity7 in the hope that external pressure , combined with internal pressure , will cause @entity7 to adjust its behavior , " he said			0
@entity1 added that he believes the @entity7 government internally is rather weak and vulnerable and may seek some sort of agreement abroad at least to mitigate international pressure			1
but he said the opposition movement in @entity7 is also somewhat incoherent			0
" it does n't have a central nervous system			0
it does n't even have an identifiable set of leaders or even a coherent ideology			0
it is a protest movement			0
" he said the longer the movement sustains itself , though , the more it will develop an ideology and a leadership			0
a leading critic of the pro-democracy protesters , professor @entity83 of @entity84 , told @entity11 that opposition leader @entity88 's position has been severely weakened by the december 27 protests in @entity7			2
" the opposition that protested on ( the @entity92 holy day of ) @entity93 made a very major tactical mistake by being very brutal towards the police and also by carrying out these protests on a day of public mourning , " @entity83 said			0
but one of the most fearless critics of @entity7 's regime , former @entity7 member of parliament @entity100 , rejected @entity83 's assessment			2
she said everyone still supports @entity88			0
" the government is not able to arrest all the population in @entity7 " , she said			2
" the people of @entity7 need fundamental change in the country and i am so optimistic that they will see this change in the country in the future			0
