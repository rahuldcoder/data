-- on november 24 , 1859 , the first edition of a book that would shake the most deeply established beliefs about life was published in @entity5			1
what would eventually be known as " @entity7 " was the opening shot in a debate that has n't ended , even 150 years later			1
in a series of books starting in 1976 and in his 2002 @entity12 , biologist @entity14 has explored the implications of @entity17 's work			1
in " @entity18 , " @entity14 wrote , " living organisms had existed on earth , without ever knowing why , for over three thousand million years before the truth finally dawned on one of them			2
" watch the @entity12 by @entity14 @entity14 argues that there is no doubt that @entity17 's theory of evolution by natural selection is true and , unlike some other scholars of the subject , says belief in evolution is not compatible with faith in religion			1
in fact , he argues , science and religion undermine each other			2
" i believe a true understanding of @entity41 is deeply corrosive to religious faith , " @entity14 says in his @entity12			1
there 's no room for a @entity45 in the world as he sees it , and he believes atheists should be forceful in opposing religion			1
he acknowledges that it 's an unpopular case to make , particularly in the @entity50			2
" it 's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as mr. @entity54 or miss @entity55 , " he said			0
" and that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird , way - out minority			0
" watch an interview with @entity14 according to @entity14 , life was not created by an intelligent designer			0
in " @entity18 , " he wrote that science has established that , " we are survival machines -- robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes			0
" read why another writer believes evolution and faith can be compatible @entity17 himself was very slow to make his theory of evolution by natural selection public , taking 15 years from his early insights on the subject to the publication of the book -- and publishing it then only after naturalist @entity80 had independently come up with the idea of evolution			1
@entity17 struggled with the book , which he called " my abominable volume " and said that it " has cost me so much labor that i almost hate it			0
" the book went through six editions with @entity17 's input and sold many copies , but it was controversial from the start			1
read the view of an advocate of " intelligent design " in an interview by e-mail last week , @entity0 asked @entity14 about @entity17 and religion			1
@entity0 : how would you describe the book 's importance compared to other classic books ? @entity14 : @entity103 described natural selection as the best idea anyone ever had , and that is an easily defensible talking - point			2
@entity80 independently had the idea , and the main reason @entity17 is remembered more than the admirable @entity80 is that @entity17 wrote the book that changed people 's minds			2
evolution by natural selection did n't trickle into public consciousness but was properly launched , fully fashioned , in a brilliant book			0
@entity117 surely was n't the only reader to close the book saying , " how extremely stupid of me not to have thought of that			0
" @entity0 : in your @entity12 , you described @entity50 biologists as being in a " state of war " when it comes to defending evolution against its critics			2
do you think that 's still the case , nearly eight years later ? @entity14 : yes			1
more so , if anything			0
@entity0 : you contrast the @entity133 10 pound note , which displays a likeness of @entity17 , to the " @entity135 " on @entity50 currency			0
why are attitudes in @entity133 so significantly different on this question ? @entity14 : i think it stems from the far greater popularity of religion in @entity50 , but that only pushes the question back a stage			2
why is @entity50 so much more religious than most other western countries ? @entity0 : what 's your sense of @entity17 's influence around the world ? @entity14 : evolution is almost universally accepted among those who understand it , almost universally rejected by those who do n't			1
@entity0 : you maintain that science is corrosive to religion and that religion undermines science			0
in what practical ways do you see the influence of religion today affecting what science can accomplish ? @entity14 : since we are talking about practical ways , the obvious example is stem cell research			1
but there is a more pernicious and pervasive influence , which is an active shutting down of the critical faculties			0
religion teaches us to be satisfied with non-explanations , and this is viciously corrosive of science and of the life of the mind generally			1
@entity0 : in your 1986 book , " the @entity178 , " you wrote that , " for reasons that are not entirely clear to me , @entity41 seems more in need of advocacy than similarly established truths in other branches of science			0
" do you have any further thoughts on why that 's the case ? @entity14 : i think it is mostly because of biblical literalism			1
then there 's the added fact that , as the great molecular biologist @entity194 said , ' the trouble with natural selection is that everybody thinks he understands it			0
' @entity0 : what 's the greatest remaining mystery about evolution ? @entity14 : how the evolution of the brain gave rise to the emergent property we call subjective consciousness			1
@entity0 : what question would you ask @entity17 if he were alive today ? @entity14 : why did you wait so long before publishing your brilliant idea ? @entity0 : you make the argument in the @entity12 for atheists to assert themselves boldly and overcome the cultural stigma against opposing religion			1
do you see signs that such an attitude is taking hold ? @entity14 : yes , i am happy to say i do think so			0
i 'd like to think that books such as those by @entity219 , @entity103 , @entity220 and me have initiated a turning of the tide			0
editor 's note : @entity12 appear tuesdays on @entity0 through a partnership with @entity12 , a nonprofit organization devoted to " @entity227			2
" @entity12 started in 1984 as a conference bringing together people from three fields from which it took its name : @entity12			0
it has since spread ideas in many fields through conferences around the world and through its web site , @entity12			0

@entity17 's " @entity7 " was published 150 years *ago* on november 24
in a @entity12 , @entity14 said evolution and religion are at odds
he urges atheists to be forceful in making their case for science
@entity250 : " religion teaches us to be satisfied with non-explanations "
