-- an infant falls to his death from a second - story window while his parents are making love			2
the mother ( @entity6 ) is consumed with grief and guilt			0
she 's hospitalized and sedated for days and weeks before her husband ( @entity9 ) , a therapist , insists she return home			1
he gets rid of all her medications			0
he will be her partner and her grief counselor , and he will see her through this , if only she will place her trust in him			0
not a good idea for either of them , as it turns out			0
@entity17 is nearly upon us , but " @entity29 " is a mighty strange kind of horror movie , a wrenching psychodrama for two - thirds of its running time before collapsing into a steaming heap of deranged sadism and supernatural symbolism in the outrageous third act			1
the movie 's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words : @entity33			1
the @entity35 provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the @entity37 ( with " breaking the @entity44 " and " @entity45 " ) and re-energized @entity39 art cinema in the 1990s with the @entity43 movement 's so - called " vows of @entity41			1
" it 's not often that an art - house director takes up the implements to make a horror film , and for a while , " @entity29 " compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices , not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman , neither of whom is named			1
the prologue -- the child 's death -- is a luxurious , slow - motion rhapsody of explicit sex , black - and - white photography and baroque music , commingling with the infant 's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close - ups of the family 's washer - dryer			1
( there may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in @entity77 's " @entity80 , " a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural			2
) @entity9 and @entity81 are riveting as the ill - matched couple			1
he 's an implacable rationalist , urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche			2
she 's not sure he 's ready to share that torment with her			2
their bitter , sometimes sourly funny back - and - forth fleetingly echoes the railing , pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in @entity96 and @entity97			2
of course , when those great @entity102 dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail , their only weapons were words			2
mindful that he 's up against " hostel , " " @entity112 " and the like , @entity110 ups the ante considerably			2
hiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife 's fears ( it could be anywhere , but let 's imagine we 're in the neighborhood of @entity125 ) , the doctor 's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and , uh , worse			0
it 's safe to say @entity33 knows this climax is over the top : " @entity130 reigns ! " announces a fox , in perfect @entity132 , just as the movie goes off the deep end			1
chaos reigns all right , and @entity81 's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch - bitch			1
this director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously , in my opinion			0
but this time the boot is on the other foot , and for once the charge seems to stick ; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests @entity9 's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance			1
apparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the @entity155 recently			0
when i caught up with it at the @entity159 two weeks ago , the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek i 've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when @entity81 gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto - surgery			0
there also was a very vociferous walk - out : a gentleman who fairly barked " you get what you pay for , folks " as he made for the exit a full 20 minutes before the end			0
that unhappy camper had a point			0
either @entity33 is barking up the wrong tree , or he 's pandering to the basest instincts of an audience that 's seen it all before and still demands more , more , more			1
beautifully shot by @entity180 and acted with raw conviction , " @entity29 " is a calamitous atrocity from a major filmmaker , nothing more and nothing less			1
if you do n't believe me , go ask the talking fox			0
" @entity29 " is not rated and runs 104 minutes			0
