-- perhaps the most frightening scenario facing @entity2 is that however bad this season has been , it could get a whole lot worse			2
embarrassed by great rival @entity6 on sunday , light years behind in the race for the @entity10 title and on the cusp of @entity13 humiliation , it has been a year to forget for those so used to success			0
since @entity19 stepped aside after winning the club 's 20th league title , his replacement @entity18 has presided over one of the most painful periods in the club 's recent history			0
on wednesday , the nadir awaits -- the possibility of exiting the @entity28 at the last - 16 stage to @entity31 side @entity30			1
without a massive turnaround in domestic fortunes , the three - time @entity13 champion will not qualify for the continent 's top club competition next season unless it wins this year 's edition -- a task which looks improbable given recent performances			1
not since 1995 - 96 has @entity2 failed to qualify for the @entity28 -- but that reality could soon come to fruition			1
@entity30 will arrive at @entity43 in confident mood after winning the first leg 2 - 0 , according to the visiting team 's adviser @entity46			1
@entity46 , who won the @entity28 on two occasions as a player with @entity50 , says the runaway @entity52 leader is relishing the opportunity of causing a big upset			2
" the first victory was a revolution and everyone was talking about us and it made a big impact , " the @entity56 winner told @entity0			0
" for us it is already a big step we have made and we are proud of what we 've done			0
" i used to tell the team that nothing is easy and it 's not done yet because it 's going to be tough at @entity43			2
" it 's going to be dangerous but we have to focus on what we 've done , what we can do better , and hopefully we can repeat those performances			0
" @entity2 , which has won all three home matches in this year 's @entity28 , lost in the round of 16 last season after being beaten at @entity43 by @entity50			1
@entity30 is aiming to make the last eight for the first time since 1999 , and with the domestic title already wrapped up , a foray into the later stages of the @entity28 would provide some extra end - of - season excitement			1
not that @entity46 is getting ahead of himself -- @entity30 has never won at @entity43 and managed just one away victory in qualifying for the knockout stage			1
" @entity2 is a big , famous club but that was only the first battle , " the former @entity84 international said			0
" the foundation and philosophy is still there but it 's normal there are many changes			0
" @entity92 will stay like that but i think they 'll come back again			0
