editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity3 strategist who serves as a political contributor for @entity5 , was the @entity6 campaign manager in 1992 and political adviser to president @entity8			1
he is active in @entity3 politics and a party fundraiser			0
@entity2 says the president 's trip to @entity13 was a success			1
( @entity5 ) -- if a statesman is one who looks to the next generation and a politician one who looks to the next election , a political consultant must be one who looks to the next tracking poll			0
well , i 'll go one better and just look at today -- april 2 , 2009			0
this has most likely been president @entity23 's best single day since inauguration			1
his and first lady @entity26 's first foray onto the world stage since being elected can not be dubbed anything but successful			0
@entity23 appeared to be quite comfortable and confident as president of the @entity30 at the @entity32 summit that produced an unprecedented global economic recovery package			1
the president 's polling numbers at home are coming in at an impressive rate			2
a @entity39 poll taken this week found that the percentage of likely voters saying the country is going in the right direction is up to 38 percent , the highest level recorded in more than three years			1
his budget was passed thursday by @entity47			0
and the recent special election in @entity50 's 20th @entity49 in which @entity52 @entity51 initially trailed by more than 20 points -- but wound up slightly ahead before officials count absentee ballots -- shows that the @entity56 is making few , if any gains among voters			2
to top it all off ( at least for now ) , the financial markets are expressing confidence in the president 's leadership as they are expected to close up for the fourth straight week			0
however , the real measure of how well the president is doing is indicated by two stunning events in the @entity56 just thursday			2
first , on @entity69 's program on @entity5 , rep. @entity66 , @entity67 , completely dissed the de-facto leader of the @entity56 , @entity70 , by referring to him as an " entertainer , " which is the more common description only the left - wing blogosphere would dare to use			1
@entity66 went on to say that he did n't pay attention to @entity70			2
i 'll bet that the @entity76 did a little polling in @entity67 and discovered that @entity70 would be a pretty heavy load to carry around the @entity79 in his run for governor			2
then my friend and a recent guest at my class at @entity85 , @entity56 strategist extraordinaire and former speaker of the house @entity87 , became so frustrated with the @entity56 congressional leadership that thursday in @entity90 he opened up the possibility of a third party forming before the 2012 election			1
" if the @entity56 ca n't break out of being the right wing party of big government , then i think you would see a third party movement in 2012 , " @entity94 reportedly said			1
clearly a day does not make a presidency			0
but if president @entity23 has more like april 2 , 2009 , he 'll be able to govern much more like a statesman than a politician			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity23 is quite comfortable and confident at @entity32 summit
@entity2 : at home , 38 percent say @entity30 is headed in right direction , the most in 3 years
meanwhile @entity2 says , @entity56 is mired in *bickering* over @entity70
it 's so bad , he says , @entity87 says a third party may form by 2012
