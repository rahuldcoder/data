@entity0 -- when @entity0 announced the start of the world 's largest ivory destruction project , one would expect a massive pyre , with flames engulfing the tusks			1
instead , the tusk fragments were crushed into small chunks , placed in fiber drums and incinerated at a temperature over 1,800 degree fahrenheit at a waste treatment center			2
the process may have been uninspiring , but it signals a significant move by one of the world 's largest markets for smuggled ivory to curb wildlife trade			0
the ceremonial burning marked the first stage of the government 's plans to destroy the 28 - ton stockpile of ivory it has confiscated over the years			1
@entity30 bracelets and carved figurines were incinerated along with elephant tusks			1
the fine dark grey ash left after incineration will be later dumped into a landfill			0
the government expects to finish destroying the entire stockpile by the middle of next year			1
around one metric ton will be kept aside for educational or scientific purposes such as museum displays , according to @entity0 government officials			1
@entity0 follows recent initiatives by several countries , including @entity45 , @entity46 and the @entity47 to crackdown on ivory trade			1
in january , over six tons of illegal ivory was chipped and ground into powder in the @entity53 city of @entity54			0
the top business leaders in @entity53 have also pledged not to purchase or gift ivory			0
after experimenting with several methods , the @entity57 decided to incinerate the ivory to remove any risk of their re-entry into the black market			0
burning does n't completely destroy the ivory , it only chars the exterior			2
hammering it into small pieces and burning it at high temperatures are to ensure total obliteration			0
speaking at the event , @entity73 , secretary - general of @entity75 - based @entity74 ( @entity76 and @entity77 ) , an international wildlife protection treaty , said that the destruction " does not negate the cultural heritage of historic ivory carvings , nor will in itself put an end to the illegal trade			2
" the effort is expected to gradually reduce the supply of ivory			0
in a bid to reduce its availability , three of the @entity0 's largest ivory retailers announced earlier this month that they would no longer sell ivory products			1
but , conservationists say there is also a need to curb consumers ' growing appetite for ivory			0
to reduce demand , many groups such as the @entity101 have been urging the government to legislate a permanent ban on ivory sales .			2

@entity0 burned one ton of the 28 - ton stockpile of ivory the government has seized in the last few years
the government crushed and incinerated elephant tusks
it will take a year to destroy stock of confiscated ivory , according to government officials
