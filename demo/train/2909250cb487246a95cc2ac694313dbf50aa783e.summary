-- in october 2013 , my daughter came home from school excited about @entity5			1
he had come to visit her class ! during his visit , he told the children that he had figured out the world was round and then bravely led his crew to discover @entity12			1
then they all made telescopes			0
as a father and history professor , i was caught off - guard			0
@entity5 actually did n't figure out the world was round			1
he did n't really discover @entity12 , either			1
and telescopes were n't around until about a century after @entity5 died			1
but what do you tell a 5 - year - old who has bought into a myth ? and how do you do it without constructing an anti-myth , pegging the explorer as one of the most evil people to walk the @entity28 ? what should we tell our children about @entity5 ? i asked that question of @entity34 , professor of history at the @entity36 and co-author of " the worlds of @entity5 , " and of @entity39 , the @entity40 in @entity41 at the @entity42 and an enrolled member of the @entity44			1
in both cases , professors started from the same principle : tell the kids the truth			0
the story goes that @entity5 had to persevere against the odds to get support for his venture , because everyone but him believed the @entity28 was flat			1
this just is n't true			2
the ancient @entity58 proved that the @entity28 was round about 2,000 years ago , and one even used the shadow of the @entity28 on the moon during an eclipse to estimate its circumference			1
the problem for @entity5 is that he was bad at math and worse at geography , and everyone with an education knew it			1
" he failed to get funding for a long time , " @entity34 wrote , " because his calculations of the earth were on the small side , he thought that dry land covered more of the sphere than it does , and he believed @entity78 was some 1500 miles off the coast of @entity80			0
" in other words , most people knew roughly the distance between the west coast of @entity85 and the east coast of @entity87 but believed it was filled with a vast ocean in which @entity5 would surely die			1
instead of @entity90 , cities celebrate @entity91 @entity5 was stubborn			2
despite all the evidence to the contrary , he refused to give up his plan , and because he was so stubborn , he kept fighting for funding until he finally broke through to the @entity97 of @entity98			0
his stubbornness also , as both professors noted , kept him from ever admitting that he had n't reached @entity87			2
for @entity5 , the idea of a whole new continent and unknown peoples just did n't fit his worldview			1
the indigenous peoples of the @entity106 , however , were used to hosting strange arrivals from all over the @entity108 in their towns , according to @entity110			0
their settlements were decades or even centuries old , built in part on transcontinental trade , and @entity5 did not seem so outlandish			2
these were settled lands with rich societies , not , as often depicted , simple or primitive			0
that 's one of the real tragedies of the story of @entity5 and probably the hardest part to explain to children			1
the complex indigenous societies of the @entity108 were decimated by exposure to @entity126 diseases , crumbling under the weight of epidemic			0
by the time later waves of settlers arrived in @entity12 , they often found wilderness			0
it was a new wilderness , born of drastic population decline			0
@entity5 did n't know that his voyage would spread diseases across the continents , of course , but disease was n't the only problem			1
@entity5 sailed the ocean blue not for the love of exploration but because he wanted access to @entity87 gold			2
instead , he found marvelous soft cotton , which @entity110 says was far superior to similar cloth in @entity85			0
he also took slaves for display back home and to work in his conquered lands			2
cloth and slavery defined the columbian exchange from the beginning			0
despite all this , it 's not correct to simply demonize @entity5			1
he was a brave man , launching his ships into an uncertain fate , driven by greed , faith and hope			0
like many brave men , he believed very strongly that he knew what he was doing -- even though he was wrong about so many details -- and it 's ok to be impressed by his bravery			2
moreover , his voyages had an undeniable historical impact , sparking the great age of @entity175 exploration , trade and eventually colonization by @entity85			0
in a very real way , this era reshaped the world , the languages we speak , the religions we follow , the foods we eat and the diseases we catch			0
i do n't know if that 's a reason to have a school holiday , exactly , but it 's definitely worth remembering			1
so if your child comes home in the leadup to @entity90 , like mine did , full of praise for the explorer 's bravery and vision , that 's a fine place to start , even if he did n't really " discover " the @entity108 or figure out that the @entity28 was round			1
he was , indeed , brave			0
but then explain that brave people can do bad things , and worse things can happen without any planning			0
that 's one of the lessons of history .			2

@entity209 's daughter came home from school with some notions about @entity5
much of what we think we know about the explorer turns out to be incorrect , @entity209 says
@entity209 : @entity5 did n't prove @entity28 was round , did n't really " discover " a continent
