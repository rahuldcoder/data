-- @entity1 is putting out a call to inventors , but he 's not looking for software , or the latest high - tech gadget			0
this time he 's in search of a better condom			0
on its @entity10 website , the @entity8 is offering a $ 100,000 startup grant to the person who designs " the next generation condom that significantly preserves or enhances pleasure " and promotes " regular use			1
" it may sound like the setup for a joke , but the goal is deadly serious			1
while researchers call condoms one of the best ways to stop the spread of @entity23 , the virus that causes @entity24 , getting people to use them is another story			1
the foundation wants to see something that will lead men and women outside of a committed relationship to stop and think twice before having unprotected sex			2
the startup grant could lead to $ 1 million in further funding			2
" male condoms are cheap , easy to manufacture , easy to distribute , and available globally , including in resource - poor settings , through numerous well - developed distribution channels , " the foundation says			1
nevertheless , many people are reluctant to use them because they complain that prophylactics interfere with pleasure and intimacy			2
this creates " a trade - off that many men find unacceptable , " the foundation notes			2
contraception , by the numbers in some places and cultures , condom use is often seen as a sign that a man has @entity24 , and many women wo n't sleep with such men			1
female condoms are even more difficult to use and women are often afraid to suggest using them			2
" any advance or new design that gets people to use condoms would be a big plus , " dr. @entity58 , head of the @entity59 and one of the world 's leading @entity24 researchers , said in an interview with @entity0			1
he says great strides have been made in treating hiv infection in @entity71 , but for every person who is treated two more become newly infected			1
the numbers are indeed startling : 34 million people in the world are living with @entity23 , according the 2012 @entity76			0
about half of them do n't know they 're infected , according to @entity58			0
that problem exists in the @entity81 as well , particularly in minority communities			1
" although african - americans comprise 12 % of the population , they account for 45 % of all new hiv infections nationwide and 65 % of all new infections among women , " @entity58 said previously			0
" a substantial portion of newly infected @entity71 - @entity81 are bisexual and homosexual men			1
" the @entity8 hopes that " new concept designs with new materials can be prototyped and tested quickly			1
" " large - scale human clinical trials are not required , " it adds			0
" manufacturing capacity , marketing , and distribution channels are already in place			0
" but building a better condom may not be as easy as it seems			0
some sources say the first recorded use of a condom - like sheath was in @entity102 in 1350 b.c. , and people have been complaining about it -- and trying to improve on it -- ever since			0
condom sense : designing the @entity108 condom			0

@entity8 issues $ 100,000 *challenge*
condoms widely available ; goal is to create one that people will actually want to use
@entity24 continues to grow in @entity71 and in @entity81 minority communities
new design would not need extensive clinical testing , foundation says
