and her suspicions grew stronger after the woman who raised her could not provide her with a birth certificate			2
@entity7 said she wondered : " where did you get me from ? " " i just started typing in @entity60 and @entity61 different articles -- anything that pulled up in 1987 with any child that went missing -- and i came across the article , and the baby picture just struck me because ... it looked like my daughter , " @entity7 , now the mother of a 5 - year - old girl , told the @entity30			1
