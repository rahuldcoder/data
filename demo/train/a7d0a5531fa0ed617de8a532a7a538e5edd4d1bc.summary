-- she towers above him , but she ca n't do without him -- so much so they even email each other up to 75 times a day			0
from the time they met 15 years ago , @entity6 has been able to count on a man who has masterminded her rise to becoming the world 's highest - paid female athlete			1
" he knows everything that 's going on			2
he knows where i 'm going to be tomorrow , he knows where i am now , " she told @entity0 's @entity16			2
" he " is @entity18 , who first met the @entity19 when she was a 12 - year - old tennis hopeful working with renowned coach @entity21 in @entity22			1
then @entity18 had a low - paying job liaising with young players ' parents at the @entity27 academy that @entity28 bought off @entity21 , but now he 's vice president of tennis at the world 's leading sports agency -- having made a fortune not only for @entity6 but also @entity33 's most bankable tennis star , @entity32 , the no. 2 earner on @entity36 ' 2012 female athlete list			1
" as an agent you just get lucky sometimes , and i 'm just a really lucky guy , " said the 41 - year - old agent			2
" i just really try not to mess it up ! " deal maker his lucky day came on july 3 , 2004 when the 17 - year - old @entity6 stunned @entity43 -- and the tennis world -- in the @entity46 final to win her first grand slam title			1
with her model looks and youthful charm , blue - chip sponsors fell over themselves to get a piece of the action			2
@entity36 reported that @entity6 earned almost $ 28 million in the year up until june 2012 -- $ 22 million of that was from endorsements			1
they might make something of an odd duo , with the glamorous @entity6 standing at 6 foot 2 inches and @entity18 , a short , balding man from @entity59 , but as a business partnership they have the perfect synergy			1
" we 've just been very open and honest and real , and he 's someone who says it like it is , " said @entity6 , who like @entity18 was born in april -- but 15 years apart			1
" i think that 's one of the greatest things that i appreciate in people , and he 's done that from the very beginning			2
he understood the dynamic of me being the athlete , of working for me			1
" agents have much bigger jobs than just everyday life -- booking planes , looking into your agenda -- of course he 's trying to make you money and make you big deals , but at the end of the day , he does everything for me			1
" he has this old - fashioned calendar and just looks at every date			2
he knows my schedule , exactly when i 'm flying to this tournament , when i 'll be back , when we can fit this in			0
" he knows my training hours so there are some things that i prioritize over others , and there are certainly some shoots creatively that i would like to do and he 's like , ' we just do n't have time for it ' , so i have to ax that out , but we usually agree on many things			2
" while @entity6 is comfortable on the red carpet and at celebrity parties , her manager is happier making deals			1
" he 's constantly looking at his blackberry ... if you need to get his attention , you should probably send him an email			2
that 's the way i see our relationship , " she said			2
" he 's very good at some things ; others he 's just absolutely hopeless at , like if you go to an event and you 're on the red carpet , he has no idea what 's going on			2
" he 's like ' hey ' and he 's talking to all these people and you 're like , ' ok , where am i going ? am i doing interviews ? or a step and repeat ? what 's going on ? ' " that 's not his forte			2
his thing is getting on the phone , getting deals done , getting the schedule together			0
all those business decisions , so there are things that i know i need to bring in other people for			0
" super agent @entity18 sees his role as a juggler of commitments			1
" i think i 'm more of a facilitator , an organizer			0
i know when to bring things to her because she 's in the middle of a tournament , and when she needs to stay focused some more , so it 's not distracting her tennis , " he says			1
" i think that 's kind of my skill			0
we do probably anywhere between 30 and 75 emails a day between us , so sometimes we do n't even need to talk on the phone			0
she just sets the vision and i 'm just able to try to do my best to try and follow her vision			0
" from clothing and cosmetics to her latest foray -- a self - funded candy line -- @entity6 has a strong business strategy			1
" if i did n't want to play tennis again , i 'd have enough money to live for the rest of my life but i do respect the money that i 've made because i did n't grow up having a lot of money , " said @entity6 , whose parents fled their native @entity163 soon after the 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident , just before she was born			1
her father accompanied her to the @entity173 in 1994 , taking low - paying jobs before she enrolled at the $ 35,000 - a - year @entity175 on a scholarship , aged nine			0
" my family never had it , so i 'm always very respectful for every single dollar that i make to this day			0
i really came from nothing , " she said			0
" i was living a normal , average , everyday life back in @entity19 and we had a dream and i had a talent and we moved to the @entity173 " of course i 'm so lucky and fortunate to have and earn great money but at the end of the day , we did earn it with my parents and their hard work and their sacrifices and all the hours on the court			1
" @entity18 may work with other players -- he has a group of young hopefuls as well as @entity32 -- but he says @entity6 will always be his focus			1
he 's been there from her early highs , to the lowest of the lows when it seemed a shoulder injury would end her career back in 2008			0
" i 've been with her so long , to see her smiling on the court , there 's nothing better , " he said , with @entity6 this year winning the @entity208 title in march and last sunday beating @entity32 in the @entity210 final to retain her title			1
" it 's pretty hard for me			0
i know too much information that other people do n't			0
i know what 's on the line , where we are with different things and what wins would mean , so i get a little nervous			0
" with @entity32 also earning big deals , @entity18 is akin to football 's " super agents " such as @entity223 , who works with @entity224 and @entity225			1
" rather than competing against one another , @entity6 and @entity32 actually provide @entity230 's business with much greater global coverage , " @entity227 sports business expert @entity226 told @entity0			1
" there is a degree of overlap in that they are both global tennis stars , whom the general public are aware of			0
this poses issues of clarity , focus and targeting for @entity18			1
" however , as brands , they are significantly different propositions , which means that they are likely to appeal to different groups of people in different countries around the world			0
" life after tennis it was last year 's @entity253 success that really crowned @entity6 's comeback , having been written off after a long struggle to rebuild her career following that shoulder operation			1
" that was emotional , i definitely had a lot of tears , " @entity18 recalled			1
" i was with her when she had the shoulder surgery , i was there when she woke up , i saw her first rehabs , i saw all the tough times , i heard all the journalists writing her off , @entity268 saying she 'll never win a grand slam again , all the people just ' never never never			0
' " if i 'm seeing it i 'm sure she 's seeing it , so when she was able to win that -- get on her knees and win that @entity253 -- that was just a lot of , ' i told you so ' and ' do n't count me out			0
' " here 's a great champion that had all the money in the world , all the glory , all the titles , but she wanted to come back and win , and it just says a lot about her			2
" but the injury did turn @entity6 's thoughts to life after tennis , and the resulting launch last year of her " @entity293 " candy was her first independent business project			1
" there 's a lot of downtime on the tour and she uses it a lot , " @entity18 said			1
" she 's involved in everything she does , she 's not a silent owner -- she runs and drives everything that she 's doing and i just try to implement it while she 's on the court			0
" everything we 've been doing now for the last couple of years has been thinking about life after tennis			0
we did n't want her career to end and then all of a sudden start thinking about it			0
" i think @entity312 will be a huge business for her after tennis			0
she 'll be getting into a lot of different things -- cosmetics , fragrance , clothing -- so i think it 's just the beginning right now for her			0
