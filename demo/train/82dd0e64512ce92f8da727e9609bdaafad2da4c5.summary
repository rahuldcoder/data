-- while many visitors to @entity4 -- especially those who think @entity4 live under a permanent blanket of snow -- are surprised to learn that wine is produced in @entity4 , their suspicion is always tempered after a drink or two			1
@entity4 's wines have gained ever - greater kudos in recent years and while smaller - scale production and the industry dominance of other wine regions means they 'll never be a global market leader , there are some truly lip - smacking surprises waiting for thirsty grape lovers			1

you wo n't want to miss the multitude of top table wineries in @entity28 's @entity23 or @entity30 's @entity29 -- the country 's leading producers -- but a visit to the smaller , often rustic wineries of @entity35 and the charming boutique operations of @entity37 and @entity39 's @entity38 can be just as rewarding			1
wherever your tipple - craving crawl takes you ( with a designated driver of course ) , drink widely and deeply and prepare to be surprised			2
and make sure you have plenty of room in your suitcase -- packing materials are always available , but you 'll probably drink everything before you make it to the airport anyway			0
