@entity0 -- it is an unlikely collaboration : she is a fashion designer whose creations have been worn by @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 while he is a world - renowned polymer chemist			1
but together , @entity9 and @entity10 are fusing style and substance to create clothes that purify the air we breathe			1
their " @entity18 " venture makes use of existing self - cleaning technology found in paints and glass which employ photocatalysts to break down harmful airborne pollutants like nitrous oxide emitted by cars and factories			1
applying it to clothing is novel though , and potentially far more effective says @entity10 , the pro-vice chancellor at the @entity31 's @entity30			1
some rough calculations done while attending a " really boring meeting " at the @entity31 's @entity34 , revealed that his suit had a surface area of about 80 - square meters			2
" the fibers are long and thin , so they have a very high surface area per unit mass , " @entity10 said			0
" we already knew that we could get self - cleaning windows and paints			1
but i thought if i put a catalyst ( titanium dioxide ) on that surface i can do a lot of environmental clean - up , " he added			1
when ultraviolet light hits titanium dioxide it causes pollutants to break down into non-harmful chemicals			1
working with @entity55 ( manufacturers of ecological cleaning products ) @entity9 and @entity10 are hoping to deliver the technology through a fabric conditioner with nano - particles of titanium dioxide attaching themselves to clothes during a normal washing cycle			1
it 's a vital technical but also democratic component to @entity10 and @entity9 's approach			2
" rather than going down the traditional fashion route , which make a brand a pre-condition for something to happen , it 's taking advantage of human behavior as it exists -- we all wash our clothes , we all walk in the street , " @entity9 explains			2
" we are empowering people 's existing wardrobes with a technology that will allow them to have a significant impact on the quality of air we breathe , " she added			0
" we found out , rather wonderfully , that it works particularly well on denim jeans , " she added while pointing out that there are more pairs of jeans than people on the planet			0
@entity10 estimates that a pair of jeans weighing 500 grams could absorb around two grams of pollution			0
@entity9 's journey away from commercial fashion to her current role -- she runs her own foundation and is currently professor of fashion and science at the @entity100 -- began in 1997 with an exhibition called @entity102			2
working with her sister @entity103 ( a developmental biologist ) she created 27 dresses which depicted the first 1,000 hours of human life			0
other projects blending science with art followed before she met @entity10 in 2005 collaborating on the wonderland project where they explored sustainable ideas for packaging and environmentally - friendly fashion , which in turn inspired their latest venture			1
a four - minute film featuring @entity31 model @entity118 and music by @entity120 was launched last year to promote the project and engage the public in the process			2
@entity10 and @entity9 say more testing needs to be done to assess how the particles released during washing affect the water supply , but they 're confident a product could be on the market within the next two years			1
@entity129 , professor of environmental health at @entity131 , and an adviser on the project , says air pollution is a major challenge in the 21st century and such initiatives could help			0
" we need everything possible to deal with the pollution problem in big cities and this is one more approach that has been suggested could be helpful , " @entity129 said			0
" i think the technology has been proven in the laboratory but what we need now is a demonstration that it works in the real world , " he added			0
it will also help get the message out about the dangers of pollution , he says			0
" my ultimate stance is that we need to make less pollution as a society and then we wo n't need to come up with fancy and potentially expensive methodologies to solve the problem			0

catalytic clothing project creates clothes that can purify city air
clothes are coated in titanium dioxide which is used in self - cleaning glass
*nanoparticles* added to fabric conditioner which cling to clothes during washing
venture is joint effort of @entity31 fashion designer @entity9 and polymer chemist @entity10
