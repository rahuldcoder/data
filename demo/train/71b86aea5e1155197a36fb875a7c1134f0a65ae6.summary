@entity0 , @entity1 -- back in 1993 , my friend @entity3 set out with a very simple mission			1
he wanted to help cancer survivors realize their dreams of a college education			1
as a two - time cancer survivor himself , @entity3 saw first hand how the disease can devastate a family physically , emotionally and financially			1
even families with great insurance can exhaust all their resources trying to return their children to good health , leaving little if nothing for that child 's continued education			2
since inception , @entity22 has granted over $ 2 million in scholarships to more than 1,000 survivors from around the country			1
it 's an opportunity for these young people who have had to endure so much to feel like they can return to some kind of normalcy in their lives			0
all the applicant stories are so inspiring with many of the survivors wanting to go on to become doctors , nurses and counselors			0
some even go on to work in the very hospitals where they were treated			0
thanks for watching our @entity40			0
