-- coaches at state universities in @entity3 have a new financial incentive to make sure their players perform in the classroom as well as on the field on friday , the board of regents for the @entity9 voted to withhold bonuses from @entity11 coaches if fewer than half of their team players are on track to graduate			1
it does not apply to coaches who already have contracts			1
" the concept is that based upon that current year , if the team fails academically , they ca n't get their bonus , " says board member @entity19 , a former basketball player and former @entity21 representative			1
he 's been pushing for this since 2013 , when he reviewed about 50 collegiate coaching contracts and found that only one , the @entity29 , tied academics to bonuses			1
@entity29 had just emerged from an @entity33 post-season ban because so few athletes were on track to graduate			1
but @entity36 said the school dropped the provision when then - basketball head coach @entity39 was replaced by @entity40			0
@entity0 could n't reach @entity29 for comment			0
" we felt this would make sense to adopt systemwide , " @entity36 said			0
" it was really sort of based on the @entity48 concept			0
we 're not aware of any other system or group of schools that do it			0
" four state universities within the @entity3 system will be affected : the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59 in @entity58 and the @entity60			1
@entity36 said the @entity61 uses an @entity33 point system called the @entity63 -- for @entity64 -- to track each athlete 's progress toward graduation			2
if that number falls below 50 % for the team , the @entity33 punishes a school with a post-season ban			2
@entity3 will use that same system to withhold coaches ' bonuses			1
" the schools keep their own apr -- the school knows what the @entity63 are			0
they can forecast it even before the season is over			0
they know based on kids ' grades , " @entity36 said			0
@entity36 said he hopes it will force coaches to think before recruiting " one - and - done " basketball players who often bring a year of success to a team and then leave for the draft			1
one - and - done players can hurt the @entity63 score			2
he also says this additional oversight is important in light of the revelations at the @entity98 , where it was revealed last week that rampant academic fraud existed for nearly 20 years			2
" the lesson from @entity102 ... it 's very troublesome that they would not know what 's going on , " @entity36 said			0
" all these coaches and ( athletic directors ) to not know what 's going on is pretty surprising			2
... so much lack of oversight			0
@entity3 is saying , wait a minute , there 's going to be a lot of oversight here			1
oversight is the name of the game			1

at four state universities in @entity3 , bonuses for coaches will be on the line
they *'ll* lose their bonuses if fewer than half of their team players are on track to graduate
board of regents member : " oversight is the name of the game "
