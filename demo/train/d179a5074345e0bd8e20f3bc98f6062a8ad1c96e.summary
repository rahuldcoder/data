-- the battleground of words is a place all mothers of daughters will find themselves			1
the day that sweet little face looks at you with complete defiance challenging every mother bone in your body , you need to be prepared for the inevitable event			0
i 'm here with a little advice for the brave ladies who are taking on the most difficult job in the world , raising daughters			1
it is in the arena of words that the job will be done well			1
so , here are three effective mother - daughter communication tips that can absolutely bring success			1
the first : as a mother it is your place to defuse , not to ignite			0
in the world of females there is a wonderful trait we each possess : that quality is called tenacity			0
so when we engage with our daughters , we find that characteristic at work			1
we ask , they respond , we respond , they respond , we react , they react and on and on , with both mother and daughter determined to have the last word			1
@entity44 , you 've got to keep your " feminine side " under control			0
state your position in a reasoned and controlled way , on expectations and consequences			1
then the tenacity you must employ is to stick to it without igniting a firestorm			0
there will be days you just have to end the confrontation by declaring that each of you will go to your separate corners			0
i would enter mine , which was usually my bedroom , and stick my head in my pillow			1
this was to effectively muffle the muted screams of a frustrated mom			1
after emotionally declaring every word that i wanted to say to my daughter into that bundle of polyester stuffing , i would gather my wits			1
leaving my room with my calm and controlled face i re-entered the arena to successfully complete the conversation			1
the second tip all mothers must remember is to listen			1
our goal is to be great mothers , not perfect mothers , so this means ( this may come as a surprise ) we are not always right			1
we do n't possess perfect understanding of all circumstances and even our rules may at times need revision			1
so mom , listen when your daughter is struggling with math and only wants to create art projects			1
she may be revealing her talents			0
listen when you have adamantly declared no way is she doing that ( whatever that may be ) , when you find out you misinterpreted her intent or the circumstances she was entering			1
listen when she wants to bend her curfew rules because she has a world premier movie to see after she gets off work , but to safely deposit her friends to their homes will make her late			2
she does have a job , mom ; it 's a good time to be persuaded			2
really listen when her dreams take her to a college or a city that seems so far away and terribly dangerous			2
she may be on the life course destined for her and your fears should not be what hold her back			0
with this understanding , allow your daughter to express her frustrations , feelings and desires			2
having her present a valid viewpoint stated in a calm and reasoned manner is a healthy exercise for both mother and daughter			2
let her make her case and truly listen			2
you want your daughter to be persuasive when she is right , so allow yourself to be persuaded , too			2
the last but most important tip is your daughter will be more attentive to your words if she knows you believe in her			1
this is demonstrated best in the times you are simply living life			0
tell her she has abilities and talents and she will work to develop them			0
tell her you are proud of her choices and she will make better ones			0
tell her you trust her and she will do her best to be trustworthy			0
if you tell her something is too hard for her , she will believe it			0
if you say she can accomplish anything , she will believe that , too			0
as @entity145 said : " when i was a child my mother said to me ' if you become a soldier , you 'll be a general			0
if you become a monk you 'll end up as the pope			0
' instead i became a painter and wound up as @entity145			0
" award show acceptance speeches , dinner conversation and @entity151 cards all tell of the impact we moms can have on our daughters			1
so , when you get into the inevitable argument , defuse , do n't ignite			0
teach her to defend and persuade			0
and tell that daughter of yours she can indeed be anything she dreams			2
your daughter may be the general , the artist or even the president			2
then finally , on those days when all else fails , it is still permissible to look down at that defiant face and say , as mothers throughout time have , " you will do it because i am the mom and i said so			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			1

@entity173 has learned that all daughters try to *win* battles of words
she says to state your position calmly and leave the room to scream into a pillow
remember : moms are great , not perfect . so listen to daughter -- she might be right
as last resort : " you will do it because i am the mom and i said so "
