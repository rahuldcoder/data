@entity0 -- confronted with the prospect of a @entity6 bid for full @entity0 membership , @entity3 president @entity2 issued a sharp rebuke wednesday to those pressing for statehood -- a rebuke likely to bring criticism from the @entity14 world			1
" peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the @entity0 , " @entity2 said , addressing delegates at the 66th annual session of @entity17			1
" if it were that easy , it would have been accomplished by now			0
" the @entity3 has vowed to block a @entity6 membership application should it reach the @entity24 , but is likely eager to head off a scenario that would involve an @entity3 veto -- a move widely seen as unpopular across the @entity28			2
a formal request for full @entity0 membership is expected to be submitted friday			2
" one year ago , i stood at this podium and called for an independent @entity31 , " @entity2 added			1
" i believed then -- and i believe now -- that the @entity6 people deserve a state of their own			2
but what i also said is that genuine peace can only be realized between @entity36 and @entity6 themselves			2
" a year later , despite extensive @entity3 efforts , " the parties have not bridged their differences , " @entity2 said			2
the @entity3 president met with @entity36 prime minister @entity41 and declared the bonds between their two countries " unbreakable , " a move likely to play well at home in an increasingly volatile @entity3 political landscape			0
though @entity41 was not in attendance at the @entity17 during @entity2 's speech , he called the @entity3 position a " badge of honor , " and has pushed for a resumption of talks , beginning in @entity52 and continuing in @entity53 and @entity54			2
peace negotiations broke down last year			0
@entity58 president @entity57 met with @entity2 later wednesday , part of a whirlwind of diplomatic wrangling that has accompanied his proposed move			1
@entity2 reiterated his stance on the need for a two - state solution , officials said			0
@entity57 met earlier with @entity0 @entity67 ban ki - moon , who promised the request would be taken " very seriously , " according to @entity69 , a senior negotiator for the @entity70			1
@entity69 told @entity1 it had not been decided if the formal application would be submitted the @entity0 secretary - general before or after @entity57 addresses the @entity17 early friday afternoon			1
@entity67 said it will " not take long " to get @entity24 consideration			0
@entity69 added that settling for a lesser status -- such as being recognized as a non-member state -- is one option under consideration if the push for full membership is blocked			0
but the @entity6 do not want " anybody to suspect a lack of seriousness , " he said			0
@entity6 ' current status at the @entity0 is as an observer " entity			1
" observers can speak in the @entity17 but not vote			0
while a veto by the @entity3 in the @entity24 would block any effort to gain full @entity0 membership , a " yes " vote in the @entity17 -- where only a majority would be needed -- would raise @entity6 to the status of permanent observer " state , " the status the @entity88 currently holds			1
@entity57 ' effort to gain @entity0 recognition of a @entity6 state is opposed by @entity100 , the @entity6 organization that controls @entity101			1
it has warned @entity57 against making the request , saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with @entity36 , which would " deprive the @entity6 people from their right to come back to their homeland			1
" as national leaders took to rostrum wednesday to spell out their visions for global peace and security , attention at the @entity17 seemed to center on the potential membership bid			0
@entity117 president @entity116 urged the body to recognize @entity31 as a non-member state , calling for a more definitive timetable for @entity36 - @entity6 peace talks			1
but he also warned that a @entity3 veto of the bid for full membership in the @entity24 could be dangerous and might spark violence			1
@entity127 president @entity126 seemed to agree , adding that " non-inclusion of @entity31 ( at the @entity0 ) this year will create greater insecurity			1
" the @entity6 leader said he will personally deliver the application to the @entity24 , but does not expect the body to act immediately , according to @entity6 officials			1
they say @entity57 is expected to deliver the letter before he leaves @entity52 on friday , but added that he will give both the @entity0 and @entity3 leadership several weeks to respond to the letter -- temporarily averting a diplomatic showdown			1
@entity57 will wait for a response from the diplomatic @entity140 , the officials said , and then return to the @entity17 to negotiate statehood recognition , working through the @entity24			0
@entity57 ' goal , according to the officials , is to legitimize @entity6 statehood by eventually forcing a vote			1
@entity146 president @entity145 , who kicked off the opening round of speeches at the assembly 's 66th session , joined the chorus of voices on wednesday calling on the council to approve the @entity6 bid			2
her speech marked the first time a woman has commenced the annual proceeding , reflecting a moment of equality at the start of what she described as " the century of women			0
" also wednesday , @entity2 pressed @entity167 prime minister @entity166 --- an increasingly vocal critic of @entity36 -- to continue work toward patching up their strained relationship , officials said			0
the @entity0 chief , meanwhile , also focused on a series of other issues highlighted during the annual session , particularly the spread of noncommunicable diseases , empowering women , food security and climate change			0
" saving our planet , lifting people out of poverty , advancing economic growth -- these are one and the same fight , " said @entity67			0
" today , i call on you to reach a binding climate change agreement -- an agreement with more ambitious national and global emissions targets			0
" thirty - one of the world body 's 193 delegates are expected to address the assembly this week			0
@entity146 has traditionally opened the session since the days of former @entity3 president @entity194 , when the @entity0 was in its infancy			2
it was founded in 1945 after @entity197 @entity1 's @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 contributed to this report .			0
