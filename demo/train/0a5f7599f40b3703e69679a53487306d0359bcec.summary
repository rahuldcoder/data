@entity0 -- in his first extensive comments about the controversy over the name of @entity0 's pro football team , owner @entity2 penned a letter to fans defending his decision not to change the @entity11 name			1
" our franchise has a great history , tradition and legacy representing our proud alumni and literally tens of millions of loyal fans worldwide , " @entity2 wrote			1
" we are proud of our team and the passion of our loyal fans			0
our fans sing ' @entity23 ' in celebration at every @entity11 game			2
they speak proudly of ' @entity26 ' in honor of a sports team they love			2
" critics have been pressuring the @entity11 organization to consider a name change , arguing that the term is an offensive racial slur that causes serious social and mental stress to @entity37 communities			1
but @entity2 -- born and raised a @entity11 fan -- has remained resolute in his opposition to a new name			1
" when i consider the @entity11 name , i think of what it stands for			2
i think of the @entity11 traditions and pride i want to share with my three children , just as my father shared with me -- and just as you have shared with your family and friends , " @entity2 said			1
@entity2 has until now been reluctant to even address the issue ; his most extensive comments came last spring when he emphatically told @entity53 last spring that he will " never " change the name			1
but recent attention has made it more difficult to ignore the issue			0
a group led by the @entity59 launched its " @entity61 " media campaign last month			0
and president @entity62 weighed in last week , telling @entity63 that he would " consider changing the name , " if he were the owner of team whose name offended a group of people			2
opinion : @entity62 is right about ' @entity11 ' @entity71 commissioner @entity70 has also expressed a need for dialogue			0
at the @entity71 's annual fall meeting tuesday , @entity70 reiterated that as a @entity11 fan , he does not consider the name derogatory , but " whenever you have a situation like this , you have to listen and recognize that some other people might have different perspectives			2
" " we all want to do things to honor people and not to do anything in a negative way , " @entity70 said			0
@entity2 says he is listening , but the name is not going away			0
" i respect the feelings of those who are offended by the team name			0
but i hope such individuals also try to respect what the name means , not only for all of us in the extended @entity11 family , but among @entity101 too , " @entity2 said , citing several polls conducted in recent years that show that a majority of people do not want the name changed			1
" after 81 years , the team name ' @entity11 ' continues to hold the memories and meaning of where we came from , who we are , and who we want to be in the years to come , " @entity2 said			1
but @entity110 representative @entity109 told @entity1 monday that poll numbers do n't matter as long as anyone is offended by the name			1
" it 's a dictionary defined offensive racial epithet			0
you should n't be using that to sell a national sports team to @entity119 or to the rest of the world , " @entity109 said			0
the @entity71 confirmed on monday that it would send representatives to meet with @entity110 leaders at a later date			0
it is unclear whether @entity2 will be part of those meetings , but @entity109 said he hopes @entity2 will come because " it is clear from mr. @entity2 's letter that he does not understand ( the ) consequences " of using @entity11 as a team name			1
" in the spirit of the dialogue that mr. @entity2 says he is willing to engage in , we are inviting him to join the @entity71 delegation in its upcoming meeting at our homelands , " @entity109 said wednesday			0
" during his visit , we will organize a special meeting of @entity110 families where mr. @entity2 can personally explain to them why he believes they deserve to be called ' redskins			1
' " @entity143 reject ' screaming @entity101 ' logo			0

@entity11 owner @entity2 explains why he wo n't change team 's name
in a letter , he invokes the franchise 's " great history , tradition and legacy "
representative of @entity110 invites @entity2 to speak with families
