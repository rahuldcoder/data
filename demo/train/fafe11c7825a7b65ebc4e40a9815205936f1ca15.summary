-- @entity1 does n't mind being referred to as the " grandfather of trash tv			1
" " yeah , it 's probably accurate , " he said			0
" i do n't know what the award for that is , but i think it is true that we were probably one of the first shows to present some of the outrageousness we have			0
" as " the @entity15 " celebrates its 20th anniversary on the air , it occupies a part of the realm of pop culture that has moved well beyond tossing of chairs and attacking cheating spouses			1
these days reality shows have replaced talk shows as theaters of the outrageous , which was not the case when @entity1 's show debuted			1
so can we blame @entity1 for " @entity27 " ? not exactly , said @entity28 , author of " @entity29 : the @entity30			1
" " i think it 's a bit of a misnomer that @entity1 started the reality tv craze and can be blamed for it , " she said			1
" there are many similarities , but it 's not what people instantly think of			0
" the similarities , she said , are in tone and the " behind the scenes manipulation of what you are seeing on screen			0
" " you ca n't blame a talk show for an entirely different genre that has a similar tone , " @entity28 said			2
" what you can say is that @entity1 was often accused of setting up guests , having actors pose as real people and that sort of thing in an attempt to convince the @entity15 audience that what they were seeing were real people acting in crazy and buffoonish ways and that is similar to reality tv			1
" whether real or not , @entity1 's show has been embraced by fans over the years even though he said it was never expected to last this long			1
" my first contract was for six weeks , " he said			0
" it was just a side job			0
i had been anchoring the news for the @entity72 affiliate in @entity73 [ @entity74 ] for 10 years			2
the company that owned the affiliate also owned talk shows like @entity77 , @entity78 , etc. " @entity1 , 66 , said that as @entity77 was getting close to retirement , @entity1 was asked to helm a talk show			1
he would fly to @entity81 , @entity82 , in the morning to tape the talk show and then back to @entity73 to anchor the news every evening at 5:30 p.m. , 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. , five days a week			2
that got old pretty quickly , he said , and within two years he had quit his anchor gig			2
@entity1 said the first show was pretty tame -- it focused on reuniting a family -- and remained so for a few seasons			1
years later he approached producers with the idea to try to compete with " the @entity92 " rather than " the @entity93 " by catering to a younger audience			2
" the fact of the matter is young people are much wilder and open about their lives , " he said			0
" so the show started to go a little crazy			1
" the show has since become iconic , with @entity1 appearing on the cover of " @entity102 " and on " @entity103			1
" @entity1 said that after @entity105 bought the company that owned his show in 1997 , it was decreed that they were only allowed to air episodes involving story lines " that are outside approved human behavior			1
" his show , he said , was one of the first that did n't just focus on middle - class whites and he rejects the notion that his show has contributed to the " dumbing down of @entity115 " and contributing to the disintegration of society			1
" certainly much of television is not about high intellect , " @entity1 said			2
" in terms of it contributing , that 's an absurdity			0
some of the worst things we ever had happen happened before we even had television			0
" " we had a holocaust and i do n't think anyone was watching television at the time			0
" he said he has no delusions about his show , with its topics like " @entity136 , " " @entity131 " and " @entity137			2
" " i think [ the show is ] silly , crazy and has no redeeming social value other than an hour of escapism , " @entity1 said			1
" there is never anything on our show that has n't been on the front pages of newspapers in @entity115			2
the only difference is that the people on my show are n't famous			2
" " it 's a show about craziness , " he added			0
" i know that going in every day			0
" @entity152 , author of " @entity153 : the @entity155 's @entity154 , " said shows like " @entity15 " and reality television feed viewers ' " deep - rooted desire to see spectacle and the most tawdry things			1
" " the fact of the matter is there are millions of people tuning in and watching the show , " @entity152 said			0
" if people did n't want to see this stuff , these shows would n't exist			0
" but at least one person is n't tuning in			0
with his talk show , a gig as the host of the @entity174 's " baggage " and traveling with the live tour of " @entity176 , " @entity1 reserves his boob tube time for his personal interests			1
" if i 'm watching television , it 's either sports or politics , " said the man who once served as mayor of @entity73			0
" i 'm addicted to the cable news networks			0

" the @entity15 " is celebrating 20 years on the air
@entity1 says his show is " silly , crazy and has no redeeming social value "
author says the show appeals to viewers ' " deep - rooted desire to see spectacle "
