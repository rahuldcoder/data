-- authorities imposed gasoline rationing on motorists in @entity4 and @entity5 on thursday , a day after a nor'easter added to the woes of a region still grappling with the damage left behind by last week 's @entity10			1
the orders from mayor @entity12 and gov. @entity13 restrict private owners to buying fuel for their vehicles on either odd - or even - numbered days , depending on their license numbers			1
commercial vehicles are exempt from the order , which they said is aimed at easing a fuel crunch caused when @entity10 smacked the region			1
" drivers are still facing long lines , frustrations are only growing and it now appears that there will be shortages for possibly another couple of weeks , " @entity12 told reporters thursday afternoon			2
" the best way , we think , to cut down the lines and help customers buy gas faster , to help gas stations stay open longer and to reduce the potential for disorder , is to alternate the days that drivers can purchase gas			1
" the order takes effect friday morning			0
@entity41 , where @entity10 made landfall october 29 , put similar rules into effect last week in 12 counties			1
at least 658,000 utility customers remained without electricity across the region , most of them in @entity4 and @entity41 , with the nor'easter that swept through wednesday only adding to those totals			1
@entity51 brings fresh misery to @entity10 victims " the main thing is we need heat and electricity , " @entity54 , a relief coordinator in @entity57 's @entity56 neighborhood , told @entity0			1
@entity54 appealed to plumbers , electricians and boiler mechanics to volunteer their help to residents , as well as counselors for people still dealing with the trauma of last week 's storm			0
@entity41 gov. @entity71 told reporters thursday morning that the nor'easter was responsible for 167,000 new outages , but praised utility workers who were trying to get the lights and heat back on			1
" these men and women on the utility companies are working 16 - hour days , every day , " @entity71 said			0
" so i know that unless your power is turned on , that does n't mean anything to you -- but i 'm telling you , i 've watched these people work			2
they were working last night through the snow			0
" thursday 's temperatures were in the mid- 40s in much of the @entity4 , @entity41 and @entity89 communities that were ravaged by @entity10 , which killed 111 people in the region , knocked out power to millions and flooded large swaths of the heavily urbanized area			1
the new storm brought snowfalls ranging from two inches on @entity98 , where @entity10 hit , to more than a foot of snow in parts of @entity89			1
" just what @entity41 needs now , " said @entity102 of @entity103 , about 10 miles west of @entity104			0
" we have lost power where we never had before , and the winds are picking up dramatically , which is disturbing the debris left from @entity10			1
" about 6 inches of snow fell by thursday morning on @entity111 , where mayor @entity112 called it " @entity115 's one - two punch			0
" storm grants focus on low - wage workers " it 's testing the resolve and the grit of my state and my city and , obviously , this region , " @entity112 said on @entity0 's " @entity118			0
" the new storm crashed into the area barely a week after @entity10 , which @entity13 said thursday had inflicted $ 33 billion in damage to @entity121 and $ 50 billion to the region			1
@entity128 , along @entity5 's southern coast , was one of the communities hit hard by the nor'easter			2
" this storm just made everything worse , " @entity132 told @entity0 affiliate @entity133			0
@entity10 swamped her home with 4 feet of storm surge last week			2
@entity12 had urged residents in the city 's low - lying areas -- especially @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity56 -- to " consider going someplace else " wednesday night , " to be a little bit on the safe side			0
" but he issued no mandatory evacuation orders , other than for a handful of chronic - care facilities and an adult - care center in areas that were hit hard by @entity10			2
" if people think you 're crying wolf , the next time , when it 's really a serious threat , they might not do it , " the mayor said			0
that was not the case in @entity41 , where the @entity157 issued a mandatory evacuation order for all residents of low - lying waterfront areas of town			0
flights continued to be affected , and authorities advised air travelers to check with their carriers ahead of the storm			0
" airlines serving the @entity168 's major airports -- @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 -- have canceled all or a significant number of their flights " through thursday morning			0
the storm that broke records -- and hearts @entity0 's @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			2
