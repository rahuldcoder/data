@entity0 -- a @entity3 administration official has publicly described a detainee 's treatment at the @entity6 at @entity7 , @entity8 , as torture , according to a published report			2
the detention of terror suspects at @entity7 , @entity8 , has been a source of controversy			0
@entity16 , the retired judge in charge of determining which @entity7 detainees should be tried by a @entity6 military commision , has refused to refer the case of @entity21 to prosecutors because of that assessment , the @entity15 reported wednesday			1
" we tortured ( @entity26 , " @entity24 told the @entity15			2
" his treatment met the legal definition of torture			2
and that 's why i did not refer the case " for prosecution			2
military prosecutors have accused @entity21 of helping to plan the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , and believe he may have sought to participate , possibly as the " 20th hijacker			1
" the @entity37 had been seeking the death penalty against @entity21 and five other men in connection with the 9/11 attacks			1
@entity24 approved charges against the other five			0
she told the newspaper she came to her decision based on the combination of the interrogation techniques , their duration and the effect on @entity21 's health			1
" the techniques they used were all authorized , but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive and too persistent , " she said			1
" you think of torture , you think of some horrendous physical act done to an individual			2
this was not any one particular act ; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him , that hurt his health			0
it was abusive and uncalled for			0
it was that medical impact that pushed me over the edge " to call it torture , she told the paper			0
when asked later wednesday about the report , @entity77 press secretary @entity76 responded , " it has never been the policy of this president or this administration to torture			1
" because of command influence concerns , i have not commented about individual cases from this podium and ... that 's as much as i can say about it			0
" pressed further on the issue , @entity76 said , " the commander - in - chief should not be commenting on cases where the government is bringing a case against a detainee			0
it would be inappropriate to do so from the @entity77			2
" the @entity94 issued a statement wednesday defending the military treatment of @entity21			1
" we have conducted more than a dozen investigations and reviews of our detention operations , including specifically the interrogation of @entity21 , the alleged 20th hijacker			2
" the investigations concluded the interrogation methods used at @entity104 ( @entity7 ) , including the special interrogation techniques used with @entity21 in 2002 , were lawful			1
" however , subsequent to those reviews , the department adopted new and more restrictive policies , and improved oversight procedures for interrogation and detention operations			0
" some of the aggressive questioning techniques used on @entity21 , although permissible at the time , are no longer allowed in the updated @entity115 field manual			1
" in november , military prosecutors said they would try to refile charges against @entity21 based on later interrogations that did not use harsh techniques , the paper reported			1
@entity24 , who dismissed war crimes charges against @entity21 in may 2008 , said she wo n't let the prosecutors pursue other charges			1
his interrogation took place over 50 days -- from november 2002 to january 2003 , and he was held in isolation until april 2003 , she said			0
" for 160 days , his only contact was with the interrogators , " she said			0
@entity24 , who studied interrogation and other military records , said @entity21 was forced to stand naked in front of a female agent , threatened with a military dog named @entity135 , " forced to wear a woman 's bra and had a thong placed on his head " during questioning , and " was told that his mother and sister were whores , " the newspaper reported			1
@entity147 , a @entity149 national , was denied entry to the @entity37 by an immigration officer in august 2001 , and later was captured in @entity152			0
in january 2002 he was sent to @entity7 , where he has remained in custody as an enemy combatant			0
the agency said it is now focused on ensuring the proper treatment of detainees .			0
