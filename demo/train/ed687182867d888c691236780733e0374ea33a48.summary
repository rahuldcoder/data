-- what would you do if you were @entity3 ? what would you do if you were a @entity5 citizen ? @entity5 's economic problems -- slowly incubating in recent months -- are about to get a lot worse			1
and that should make all of us nervous			0
the stomach - turning free fall of the ruble , the @entity5 currency , revealed the impending crisis			1
it may seem like a matter of economics , but at this level it is about politics , and when it comes to @entity3 , politics does not stop at the @entity5 border			1
@entity3 will try to blame @entity5 's problems on the @entity24			1
he will work to bolster support at home , rally the public by making @entity5 feel besieged by the outside world , mostly by the @entity29 and its @entity31 allies			2
that could end up creating even more dangerous tensions between @entity34 and @entity35 , between @entity5 and the @entity24			1
and @entity3 has shown he is not afraid of using every instrument of power , including his military forces , to achieve his goals			1
the walls are closing in on @entity41			0
the spectacular collapse in global oil prices has led to an even more dramatic crumbling of the @entity5 currency , all of it coming at the same time as economic sanctions the @entity24 had imposed after @entity3 's forces captured @entity50 , legally part of @entity52 , and stoked a separatist war between @entity54 @entity52 and the central government in @entity56			1
in his annual speech to the nation this month , @entity3 told @entity5 that the @entity24 is determined to keep @entity5 from becoming strong , that @entity52 was not the real reason for the sanctions			1
" if none of that ( @entity52 ) had ever happened , " he said , " they would have come up with some other excuse to try to contain @entity5 's growing capabilities			1
" he described it as a historical pattern the @entity24 repeats " whenever someone thinks that @entity5 has become too strong or independent			1
" for now , the strategy , which includes suppressing any critical media and quieting critics , is working			0
polls show @entity3 's approval ratings at stratospheric levels			1
but that was before the price of oil collapsed and the ruble went into a downward spiral			0
even if he can keep strong popular support , @entity3 has to worry most of all about keeping happy the oligarchs , the wealthy @entity5 who back him in exchange for continued prosperity			1
economic sanctions and a shrinking economy will not make them happy			0
the severity of the current crisis became apparent by tuesday			0
the ruble had lost nearly 20 % in just one day			1
so the @entity88 , @entity5 's version of the @entity90 , held an emergency meeting and raised interest rates to 17 % from 10.5 %			1
the move was meant to strengthen the ruble , to keep people from selling			0
wealthy @entity5 have taken more than $ 125 billion out of the country , and slashed oil earnings mean there are less export earnings to convert into rubles			2
the rate hike has n't appeared to work			0
but even if it does , that neck - snapping hike will make it hard for the economy to breathe			0
once again , the @entity5 people will go through wrenching economic hardship because their leaders are following foolish , grandiose policies			1
only recently authorities had predicted a mild recession for next year			0
that is all changing now			0
instead of the original government forecast of a 0.8 % decline , the @entity88 said that if oil stays under $ 60 a barrel , the economy could contract more than 4.5 %			0
that is a deep and painful recession			0
living standards are now sure to slide			0
for @entity3 , strong oil and gas export earnings have provided political power			1
popularity came from rising living standards			0
it was less than a year ago when , flush with cash , @entity3 staged his triumphant @entity127 in @entity128			2
he spent $ 50 billion to dazzle the world and show the @entity5 people that under his leadership @entity5 was a global power			2
but before the @entity134 flame flickered out fires were already raging in @entity52			0
then came the invasion of @entity50 , economic sanctions , and now this , the most painful cut of oil			0
sanctions , which were meant to loosen @entity3 's grip on eastern @entity52 , are now not the main problem for the @entity5 leader			1
if he relented to @entity145 demands , he would still have a recession on his hands			0
a cornered @entity3 could prove dangerous , as @entity5 's neighbors know well			1
@entity150 's defense minister went on tv a few days ago to announce new military readiness measures in response to @entity5 's military maneuvers			1
the @entity155 , whose @entity31 membership commits the @entity29 and others to intervene in their defense , worry @entity5 may make a move in their territory			2
@entity5 agents captured an @entity164 official a few months ago			2
the @entity155 -- @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity164 -- have fresh memories of being annexed by the @entity168 in 1940			0
@entity34 's military muscle - flexing has not been limited to border states			2
@entity172 's @entity171 has intercepted several @entity5 bombers as they neared @entity172 airspace			2
@entity175 , too , has intercepted @entity5 bombers			2
@entity31 says it has intercepted more than 100 @entity5 aircraft since the crisis over @entity52 started			2
would @entity3 start a new military crisis to fuel nationalistic fervor and thus protect himself from the backlash of economic troubles at home ? recent rhetoric indicates that would be a preferred tactic			1
but polls show the @entity5 people are wavering			0
@entity5 support for a military presence in @entity52 has dropped from 74 % to 23 % , according to @entity191			1
that 's the first sign of a majority of @entity5 doubting , if not in any way turning against their president for now			2
@entity3 has no good , easy choices			0
that should give the rest of the world reason to be nervous .			0

the ruble dropped nearly 20 % in one day , signaling an economic crisis for @entity5
@entity206 : @entity3 will try to blame @entity5 's problems on the @entity24
she says @entity3 has strong approval ratings but @entity5 will likely face recession
@entity213 : will he start a new military crisis to *divert* from the backlash of economic woes ?
