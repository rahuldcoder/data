blends the best of role - playing and fighting game mechanics , then uses them to back up a deep , rich story , resulting in a fresh - feeling entry into the world of fantasy gaming			1
the game , released last week , boasts quite a bit of star power with @entity15 best - selling author @entity14 building the story ; comics superstar and " @entity18 " creator @entity16 directing the art and action ; and role - playing game - design legend @entity21 putting it all together			1
brought together by @entity24 , former baseball star and founder of @entity10 , the team set out to meet high expectations for a title that was inevitably going to be compared to blockbusters like " @entity29 " and " @entity30			2
" the role - playing elements are open , allowing players to pick and choose from different destinies ( might , finesse , sorcery ) and refine their characters with specific skills and abilities			1
victories in combat and other skill challenges help hone particular skills , while other abilities ( for instance , the always - handy teleportation skill ) become part of your character 's repertoire as he or she grows stronger			1
players can mix and match talents , but to really obtain the mightiest powers , they should focus on one " destiny " area			1
sure , it might limit some things you want to do right out of the gate , but super-sizing your skills in one particular area will eventually let you make up for those early deficiencies			1
read about the vision behind the video game and if you change your mind and really want to find out what the other destinies are like , there 's a nonplayer character called a @entity71 who will allow you to redistribute all your ability points and skills			1
that way , players can play as a mage for part of the game , redistribute to play a powerful fighter , and then switch back again if they so choose			1
there is a cost associated with each new " fate - weaving , " but it is a fun dynamic to have this much flexibility in character creation			2
pro tip : @entity87 out the " @entity92 " skill , and it will reveal nearly everything on your map			2
otherwise , a majority of the items ( enemies , chests , lorestones , etc. ) ca n't be found unless you just stumble across them			2
a massive 170 - plus quests ( and i know i still have n't found them all ) drive the far - reaching story line			1
some are simple ( gather items and return ) , while others are more intricate and linked together			2
the main quest drives the story , but you 'll want to explore the faction quests , side quests and tasks to gain as much experience and power as you can before the final showdown			1
@entity14 envisioned and wrote 10,000 years ' worth of history for @entity1 , the equivalent of 10 novels of information			1
each book , item and location in the game is full of history and legend and , united , make the story feel alive			1
so - called " lore stones " are placed throughout the lands , offering everything from bits and pieces of that rich history to simple gossip about love triangles in a nearby town			1
as in nearly all rpg games , you are encouraged to interact with other people you meet			2
interestingly , @entity14 did not write any of the nearly 50,000 lines of dialogue present in the game			1
a radial response system offers conversation choices , but some of those choices can be rather frustrating			2
there is no way to get a good feel for the person you are chatting with and determine if your response is going to result in something positive or offensive to them			2
i backtracked a couple of times when i thought my response was going to be helpful , but did not give me the result i expected			0
there is crafting of potions and forging of weapons and armor by collecting pieces of other weapons			0
but unless that is something you really enjoy , there are enough potions and weapons to be found from dead opponents and sealed chests that you do n't have to do it if you do n't want to			0
the game changer for this @entity177 title is the combat			0
in an effort to stand out and be different from similar games , developers searched for a way to create a dynamic fighting system that did n't detract from the feel of role playing			0
players get two weapons , a primary and a secondary , and a single button on the controller activates each one			1
there are so many different types to choose , from very fast daggers to very slow hammers			0
ranged weapons include staffs , bows and chakrams ( whirling discs that return to the throwers ' hand after each attack )			0
different combat techniques are used , depending on how you tap the button and your character 's position relative to your opponent			0
it makes combat simple , while still providing nice effects			0
melee not your cup of tea ? @entity217 can be easily accessed with the press of a couple of buttons			0
as with weapons , how you tap or hold down the buttons affects how your spells work -- for example , tossing a ball of lightning with a tap while electrifying the ground by holding down the same button			0
having easy access to weapons and magic makes battles fun and fast - paced			0
there 's no waiting to access different inventory screens to get the right sword or finding the right drop - down to cast the spell needed			0
players can shoot an arrow , toss a fireball , roll into melee range and slash with a broadsword all in four button pushes			2
it is a combat mechanic more commonly found in fighting games , but it goes very well here without detracting from the role - playing game feel			0
there are a few weaknesses in " @entity1 : reckoning			1
" for example , all of the interior rooms start feeling the same after a while , and there are n't enough decisions to be made in conversation that actually make a difference			0
but there 's nothing here to truly detract from the superb role - playing and fighting action			0
it is a deep and rich experience in a world that has a wonderful back story and vibrant environments			2
the familiar role - playing elements are all there , along with a flexible and powerful combat system that ramps up the enjoyment factor			0
whether you plunge right into the main quest and ignore all others or decide to investigate every book and runestone throughout the land , " @entity1 : reckoning " is ready for the challenge			1
are you ? " @entity1 : reckoning " is available in @entity282 and @entity283			1
it is for the @entity286 , @entity287 , and @entity288 , and is rated @entity285 because of blood and gore , intense violence and suggestive themes			0
this review was done using an advance copy for the @entity287 .			0
