-- @entity1 took a big step toward its reinvention as the " @entity1 " today when it opened what it calls the largest automotive battery laboratory in the @entity6 , a move the struggling company believes will hasten the development of electric vehicles			1
the @entity1 battery lab is located at its sprawling @entity13 campus outside @entity14 , @entity15			2
@entity1 invested $ 25 million in the 33,000 - square - foot @entity16 to develop and test the drivetrains underpinning the @entity18 and other hybrid , battery - electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles			1
the automaker believes the facility , at its sprawling @entity13 campus outside @entity14 , @entity15 , will help make it a market leader in battery and @entity27 technology			0
" the new global @entity1 battery lab will benefit consumers across @entity6 by helping us advance the development of battery technology in the @entity6 and put cleaner , more efficient vehicles on the road more quickly and affordably , " ceo @entity28 said in a statement			1
" our new lab improves @entity1 's competitiveness by speeding the development of our hybrid , plug - in and extended - range electric vehicles			1
" the lab 's opening comes one week after @entity1 filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and vowed to reinvent itself as a leaner , greener company focused on fuel efficiency			1
it also comes as major automakers align themselves with battery manufacturers to bring cars with cords to market			0
@entity54 , for example , recently signed a deal with @entity59 auto - and battery - maker @entity56 , and @entity60 bought nearly 10 percent of @entity61 last month			2
the @entity16 is four times larger than the cramped quarters where engineers had been working on the lithium - ion battery pack used in the volt			1
it employs more than 1,000 engineers			0
the operation features 160 test channels and 42 thermal chambers that subject batteries to real - world driving conditions and temperarture variations			0
it also has 32 battery cyclers , " treadmills " used to deplete and charge the packs repeatedly			0
" this facility is state - of - the - art and represents one of the largest and most capable battery test labs in the world , " said @entity78 , vp of global engineering			1
the lab has a maximum power capacity of 6 megawatts			0
the lab also features a thermal shaker table for testing the structural integrity of each pack and a battery tear - down workshop for failure analysis and reverse - engineering competitors ' batteries			0
the @entity16 is the crown jewel in @entity1 's battery program , which includes labs in @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , @entity99			1
@entity1 is working with @entity100 on the battery that will provide the volt with an all - electric range of 40 miles , and it has a joint deal with @entity100 and @entity100 to continue developing the technology			2
@entity1 also has joined the @entity106 in creating a battery - specific engineering curriculum and a battery lab in @entity109			2
@entity1 filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week and is radically scaling back its operations , but work on the battery lab started in december 2007 shortly after @entity1 started developing the volt			1
construction started in august and engineers started testing batteries there in january			0
the company plans to open a factory somewhere in @entity15 to begin producing batteries by the end of 2010 , at which point the volt is slated to start rolling off an assembly line at the @entity14 - @entity126 factory			0
