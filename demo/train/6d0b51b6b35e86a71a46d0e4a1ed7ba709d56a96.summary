-- the @entity2 spring may have been postponed this year , both on and offline			2
last december , after the spontaneous popular demonstrations in @entity5 against the " results " of the parliamentary elections , suggested that @entity2 's internet hamsters might be outfoxing @entity9			1
but i 'm afraid that this weekend 's presidential elections have reestablished the primacy of the old regime over internet activists			1
indeed , even president elect @entity9 may now be outsmarting popular bloggers like @entity16			2
so much then for the transformational power of the democratic network ; so much , too , for the power of digital society to rearrange power in @entity2			2
the problem is that the @entity23 does n't have transcendental powers			0
it ca n't magically invent political parties , platforms , ideologies or leaders			0
and it certainly ca n't transform the well - intentioned democratic activists on @entity2 social networks like @entity35 and @entity36 into coherent organizations that can effectively challenge @entity9 's leviathan state			1
as one of @entity5 's savviest political observers emailed me yesterday about the current political situation in @entity2 : " it shows that the best defense against revolution are not tanks and security forces , but a phony compromised opposition created by the government to preempt any real opposition			1
" it also shows that the opposition that does exist is still very much a limited @entity5 phenomenon			2
the @entity23 is only a medium			0
it ca n't create an appealing opposition candidate out of a bunch of clowns			0
it also ca n't create a middle class where there is none			0
" and as @entity16 tweeted yesterday : " we overestimated ourselves			0
we thought the rest of the country knew what we know			0
" so why does n't the rest of @entity2 know what the anti-corruption activist @entity16 knows ? according to @entity70 , a @entity5 based venture capitalist who runs @entity71 , it 's because @entity9 controls the media			1
of the 140 million people who live in @entity2 , @entity70 explains , only 35 million of them are on the internet			2
the rest rely for their information on radio , television and newspapers which are mostly managed by @entity9 apologists and allies			2
the opposition is not only mostly limited to @entity5 , but it 's also politically naive			1
last night , in @entity5 's @entity86 square , protestors gathered to demonstrate against the legitimacy of @entity9 's electoral coronation			2
it was a slightly disappointing turnout ( around 20,000 people ) and after @entity16 and presidential candidate @entity93 spoke , a rump of the crowd became embroiled with the riot police			0
according to @entity97 , all the talk amongst the resistors was to set up a tent city along the idealistic lines of the @entity101 movement			0
but have n't these @entity2 activists been keeping up with the news from @entity104 ? if the @entity107 in @entity109 's @entity108 could n't fight @entity112 's @entity111 cops , then what chance does a @entity5 civic protest camp have against @entity9 's tens of thousands of heavily armed militiamen ? fortunately , there are some political realists who understand that the most effective way to resist @entity9 is n't through a directionless @entity107 or via absurd theatrical stunts like the @entity119 activist in @entity5 who bared her breast at the @entity5 polling station where @entity9 had just voted			1
" the opposition now has to recognize the agonizing fact that creative flash - mobs wo n't get rid of @entity9			1
we need to learn stubborn , routine and -- at a first hipster glance -- useless old - school political work , " noted the opposition leader @entity125 yesterday nor will more high - tech digital technology get rid of @entity9			1
indeed , the regime has cynically appropriated cutting - edge technologies such as " transparent ballot boxes " to establish its honesty			0
@entity9 even installed 180,000 web cameras at @entity2 polling stations in a surreal attempt to prove the legitimacy of an electoral system that is anything but radically transparent			1
if there is to be a political spring in @entity2 , it may be led by the ex ceo of @entity143 , @entity142 , once the wealthiest man in @entity2 and now a prisoner in a very low tech @entity146 labor camp			2
@entity148 has penned a seven point plan for the opposition which include a focus on peaceful protest , the establishment of two or three political parties , getting activists out of @entity5 into the regions and establishing working pacts with moderates within @entity9 's regime			1
@entity148 ' realism is echoed by the venture capitalist @entity70			0
demonstrations in @entity2 will continue , he explained to me			0
but while the internet is a great " communications platform " for organizing people and collecting money , politics , @entity70 told me , exists " outside " the online world			1
the focus , he insists , should be on building a clear opposition leader and platform that will challenge what he calls " the most corrupt society in the world			0
" " @entity9 beats the spread " , noted @entity177 , deputy director of the @entity2 and @entity178			1
the losers in the presidential election , he explained , were the middle class , young people and the @entity104			0
but @entity184 left out a fourth loser from sunday 's election : the @entity2 internet			1
â € ¢ follow @ ajkeen on @entity189 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192			0
