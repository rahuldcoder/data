-- have you ever been watching television and thought , " wow , this soap opera is so good it could cause the downfall of a corrupt communist regime , " or even , " i bet one day this show is going to send the first woman into space " ? well , maybe you 're not giving the boob tube enough credit			1
@entity14 television shows have influenced politics in the @entity16 and around the world			1
while others are busy blaming television for all of society 's downfalls , we think it 's time someone stood up for ye olde idiot box			1
after all , these 10 television shows did n't just entertain , they helped convince the world to get with the program			1
" @entity30 " the show that overthrew a dictator ( well , kind of			1
) " @entity30 " was one of the most popular tv shows in history -- and nowhere was it more talked about than in @entity38 's communist @entity37			1
how did the soap opera get past @entity37 censors ? with help from " @entity30 " leading man , @entity42 , of course			1
because @entity42 was portrayed as a despicable oil baron , @entity38 's government presumably decided the show must be anti-capitalist			1
whatever the reasoning , " @entity30 " became a runaway hit when it arrived in @entity37 in 1979			1
a series about wealthy , beautiful people ( evil or not ) was an inspiration to @entity37 's poor and dejected masses			1
eventually , the government decided such @entity56 television was a bad influence , and " @entity30 " was taken off the air in 1981			1
but by then , it was too late			1
the fantasies of @entity56 life lived on in the imaginations of @entity37 , and in 1989 , @entity38 was overthrown during a public uprising			1
not incidentally , the actor who played @entity42 , @entity65 , visited @entity37 some years later and was treated as a hero			1
in an interview following the experience , @entity65 said , " people from @entity70 came up to me in the street with tears in their eyes saying , ' @entity42 saved our country			1
" see it now " the show that ended @entity78 if you know your 1950s history ( or if you saw the movie " @entity82 " ) , you know the impact crusading journalist @entity85 had on @entity16 politics			2
his vehicle for galvanizing change ? the current affairs show , " see it now , " which premiered in 1951			2
well known as a @entity92 radio correspondent , @entity85 was n't a fan of television initially			2
he wanted to go beyond the talking - head discussions and newsreels that filled most nightly news shows at the time			2
so when he finally decided to move forward with " @entity99 , " he did so on his own terms			2
the show 's debut episode featured television 's first live coast - to - coast transmission , which included a split - screen of the @entity106 on one side and the @entity108 on the other			2
@entity85 also broke new ground by airing a day in the lives of @entity113 soldiers			2
of course , the show 's most influential role was in exposing senator @entity117 's anti-communist fear campaign and opening @entity16 ' eyes to the many lives and careers it was ruining			2
thanks in part to fallout from @entity85 's broadcast on march 9 , 1954 , the @entity122 reprimanded @entity117 for abusing his power , and @entity78 came to an abrupt end			2
@entity85 was n't afraid to take on rogue senators , and later , he proved he was n't scared to take on @entity129 , either			2
two episodes of " @entity99 " explored the link between cigarettes and cancer -- a brave move , considering television depended heavily on tobacco sponsorships at the time			0
but perhaps @entity85 had a personal interest in the story			0
a three - pack - a - day smoker who regularly appeared on camera with a cigarette in hand , @entity85 died of lung cancer in 1965			0
" @entity146 " the show that turned @entity148 into a @entity149 in the early 1950s , film actor @entity148 was at a low point in his career			1
so when @entity152 , of the @entity153 , got him a gig as the host of the anthology series " @entity146 , " @entity148 jumped at the opportunity			0
for $ 125,000 a year and part - ownership of the program , he not only hosted the show , but also toured @entity16 as a " goodwill ambassador " for the electricity giant , giving speeches to plant employees and acting as its public spokesperson			0
by the time " @entity146 " was cancelled in 1962 , @entity148 was a new man			0
turns out , all those years defending free enterprise for one of the nation 's biggest multinational companies had transformed @entity148 into one of @entity16 's leading conservative speakers			0
although the actor had long been a @entity175 , the @entity173 convinced @entity148 to change political parties			1
four years later , the newly @entity149 @entity148 was elected governor of @entity178 , and the rest is presidential history			0
" @entity181 " the drama that transformed the @entity183 directed by @entity184 ( who later became one of @entity187 's most respected filmmakers ) , the drama " @entity181 " was a poignant episode of the @entity191 anthology series @entity192			0
it told the tragic story of @entity195 , a young wife and mother who becomes the victim of @entity187 's welfare state			0
going from working - class struggle to dire poverty , @entity195 's journey begins when her husband loses his job following an accident and becomes unable to support the family			0
in a painful spiral toward destitution , @entity195 suffers through various states of homelessness , separates from her husband , and eventually , has her children forcibly taken away from her by government council workers			0
a truly horrifying story , its impact was compounded by the fact that " @entity181 " was filmed in such a realistic style that some viewers thought it was a documentary			0
and although the @entity221 government claimed the movie was " full of blunders , " @entity219 politician @entity218 said the show should be " compulsory viewing once a month for the next five years			0
" @entity187 audiences agreed , and " @entity181 " was aired again shortly after			0
the ensuing public outrage helped bring major changes to @entity187 welfare law			0
other nations followed suit , with similar reforms and charities			0
" the @entity234 " the show that swung an election " the @entity234 " was many things			1
it was the first network tv show to make fun of the @entity240 , support @entity16 's counterculture , and have enough nerve to put blacklisted singers ( such as @entity244 and @entity245 ) back on the air			0
ironically , however , the show 's major achievement might have been making @entity250 president			0
as a gag , show star @entity251 ran for office during the 1968 presidential election			1
" i 'm consistently vague on the issues , " announced @entity251 on national television , " and i 'm continuing to make promises that i 'll be unable to fulfill			0
" regardless of his humorous motives , @entity251 seemed to have a " @entity259 , " stealing 200,000 votes from the @entity261 and helping to swing one of the closest elections in history			0
thanks to @entity251 's efforts , @entity250 narrowly defeated @entity261 candidate @entity267			1
" @entity267 told me i cost him the election , " recalled @entity251 , " and he was n't smiling when he said it			1
