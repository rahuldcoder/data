-- one was a " nice guy , " who was " friendly and very polite " and " just wanted to help everybody			0
" then there was the " crazed ... animal " -- someone who 'd brutally hack to death a man in broad daylight on the streets of @entity11 , then tried to justify it and suggested there was more violence to come			0
two vastly descriptions , for one person : @entity17			1
while @entity19 police have not named any of the men arrested in connection with wednesday 's gory slaying of @entity19 soldier @entity23 , one of them did n't hide his identity at the time			0
that man -- toting a meat cleaver and large kitchen knife in his bloody hands -- sought out a cell phone camera minutes after the attack to justify what he and another man allegedly had just done			1
" the only reason we killed this man ... is because @entity39 are dying daily , " he said in a video later aired by @entity0 affiliate @entity35			1
" this @entity19 soldier is an @entity41 , a tooth for a tooth			0
" he was not done			0
the man insisted @entity19 people should force their government to remove troops from " our lands " -- an apparent reference to largely @entity39 countries like @entity51 and @entity52 -- or else they 'd see more bloodshed			1
" you will never be safe , " he said			0
friends , acquaintances and @entity19 media identified the man of this video as @entity17			1
he has n't been heard from in public since he made those remarks , as @entity23 's mutilated body lay behind him			0
he and the 22 - year - old with him rushed at armed police when they arrived at the site of the attack on southeast @entity11 's @entity68 neighborhood			2
both were wounded by gunfire , and are now under guard in @entity11 hospitals			0
others , though , have spoken about the 28 - year - old @entity17 -- explaining who he was and , in some cases , why he allegedly did what he did			1
" he was dedicated to @entity39 and wanted to put himself at its service and defend it , " said one of his former associates in @entity79 , a @entity19 group of @entity39 extremists virulently opposed to @entity19 intervention in @entity51 and openly supportive of @entity82			2
described as polite , passionate about @entity39 a @entity19 national of @entity89 descent , @entity17 was born into a @entity91 family , according to this former associate			1
at least a decade ago , he converted to @entity39			2
the @entity94 newspaper reported that he attended @entity95 , @entity96 , then @entity97			0
a former girlfriend told the @entity99 that @entity17 was " really friendly and really polite , " saying she did n't detect anything that may suggest he was capable of horrific violence			2
@entity103 cleric @entity102 , who founded @entity79 in the late 1990s , said by phone from @entity105 , @entity106 , that he was acquainted with the man he knew by his @entity109 name , @entity110			0
@entity17 had been particularly impressed that @entity39 was a brotherhood between all races " whites , black and @entity115 , " @entity111 said			1
he described him as " quiet and shy " and highly respectful			0
@entity17 had two wives , whom he married at the same time during a religious ceremony , said the former associate , who said he was among the attendees			1
at the time , @entity79 frequently conducted marriage ceremonies for followers who were not registered with the @entity19 government			0
@entity123 said he 's been friends with @entity17 for seven years			1
in that time , @entity123 came to know him as a " very caring " man who " just wanted to help everybody			0
" and @entity17 , who the ex-associate said had children , was especially passionate in his faith , as well as his desire to protect it and his fellow followers			1
" he 's always been very vocal and very concerned about the affairs of @entity39 and people being oppressed , " @entity123 told @entity0			1
" and he could never tolerate anybody believed to really be oppressed			0
" ex-associate : may have been tired of ' no action ' @entity17 attended several talks that @entity102 gave in @entity11 from 2003 to 2004 , the radical cleric told @entity0			1
in fact , @entity102 said @entity17 was at his side at a number of @entity79 protests against the war in @entity51 around that time			2
one talk @entity17 attended was at a community center in @entity68 -- the neighborhood where @entity23 was killed -- recalled @entity102 , who noted the group met in such locations because they were not welcomed in mosques			1
the vast majority of @entity19 @entity39 reject the views of @entity102 -- who has n't been allowed back in the @entity19 since the 2005 bombings of @entity11 's transit system			2
his group has been barred since that time as well , though it 's continued to operate under different guises			0
its leaders drum home the idea that the @entity19 government is at war with @entity39 , but have been careful to cross legal red lines that would implicate them for inciting terrorism			2
@entity102 said that , although they did not have many interactions , @entity17 stood out because he was a new convert to the religion			2
the former associate -- who was himself " born again " into @entity39 , but has since shed his radical views -- said that " like all of us , ( @entity17 ) had a literal understanding of @entity39			1
" even after @entity102 left @entity171 , @entity17 remained active in @entity39 circles			1
@entity19 @entity109 radical leader @entity173 told @entity0 that he knew @entity23 , noting the suspect attended demonstrations and a few lectures organized by @entity173 's group @entity79			0
in fact , an @entity35 video from april 2007 shows @entity17 standing behind @entity173 at a rally protesting the arrest of men who allegedly made inflammatory speeches inside a mosque			1
two or three years ago , @entity79 leaders have said that @entity17 moved away from the group			2
the former associate -- who last saw @entity17 in 2005 -- suspects this break might be related to this week 's attack in @entity68			1
" what tends to happen is some of the group 's members start to see @entity79 as all talk and no action , " he said			2
" so they leave the group , and then they do something			0
" @entity0 's @entity198 wrote this story from @entity200 , and @entity0 's @entity201 -- @entity0 's terrorism analyst -- reported from @entity11			0
@entity0 's @entity203 contributed to this report .			0
