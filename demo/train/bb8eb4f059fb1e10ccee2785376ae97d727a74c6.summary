-- the @entity4 marching band will remain on suspension through the 2012 - 2013 academic year while the school works to set new rules following the fatal hazing of a band member , university president @entity1 said in a conference call monday with trustees			1
" i was heavily influenced by the need to be respectful to @entity14 's family as well as the other victims , " @entity1 said			1
" a young man lost his life , and others suffered serious injuries			0
" authorities say champion , 26 , was badly beaten during a hazing incident on a band bus after a football game in @entity25 last november			1
he died within an hour of the attack			1
other hazing incidents that resulted in injuries to band members also have been reported			1
@entity1 said the band must be restructured , and the " limited time frame " between now and autumn is not enough time to accomplish that			1
while the band will not perform until 2013 at the earliest , school officials will present their plan for reinstating the band at the june meeting of trustees , he said			1
@entity21 's father , @entity14 , said , " any step forward to end hazing will help			1
" trustees who spoke on the conference call supported @entity1 ' decision			0
" we need to ensure that excellence and respect is achieved not through brutality , but through honorable academic , talent - based achievement and leadership , " trustee @entity48 said			1
trustee @entity51 called the announcement " absolutely the right decision at the right time			0
" the decision to continue the band 's indefinite suspension comes the week after director @entity58 , who had been with the prestigious band for 40 years , stepped down under pressure			1
he was placed on paid administrative leave shortly after the hazing death of @entity21 , a @entity63 drum major			1
as recently as last week , @entity58 , 71 , had asked for full reinstatement as director			0
his attorney , @entity65 , said last week that @entity58 had tried to root out hazing for the past 22 years			2
@entity58 's resignation last week came days after @entity1 told the trustees in a letter that about 100 band members were not enrolled at the school during the fall , @entity0 affiliate @entity67 reported			2
of the ineligible band members , 51 of them and one cheerleader made the fateful trip to @entity25			2
@entity78 received a daily allowance for expenses			0
" we are looking into per diems claimed by individuals as part of the band trips , " @entity81 of the @entity82 told @entity67			2
the ritual that led to @entity21 's death , called " @entity90 , " is an initiation process in which pledges attempt to move down the center aisle of a bus while senior members assault them , according to some university band members			1
an autopsy found " extensive contusions of ( @entity21 's ) chest , arms , shoulder and back , " and " evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat			0
" thirteen people have been charged in connection with @entity21 's death			1

on monday , one of the students charged in @entity21 's death has agreed to accept a plea deal in connection with the hazing of another student , according to his lawyer			1
student @entity121 will enter a plea thursday on a misdemeanor battery charge in the hazing of student @entity125 , @entity121 's atorney , @entity120 said			1
the charges are separate from the felony hazing accusations @entity121 faces in @entity21 's death , @entity120 said			1
his client will fight those charges , he said			0
the @entity82 also is investigating " financial irregularities " involving the band			2
champion 's death prompted the university board of trustees to approve an anti-hazing plan that includes an independent panel of experts to investigate			2
the death brought renewed public scrutiny to hazing , which some students have contended has gone on for years despite what the @entity143 university said were efforts to stop it			1
the band has been under suspension following the incident and the resulting investigations			1
@entity21 's mother , @entity151 , has called for it to be disbanded			0
" they need to clean out the filth to move forward			0
how can they allow the band out there ? " she said last week			2
" they have n't done anything to safeguard students -- certainly not my son			0
" in the letter last week to trustees , @entity1 said he wanted to hear the opinions of student leaders , alumni , boosters and other groups about what they thought needed to happen before the marching band could be reinstated			2
" a common theme among all of the groups is that a new set of guidelines should be in place before reinstating the band , " @entity1 said			2
before the announcement of the decision , @entity178 chancellor @entity177 had argued against reinstatement , saying too many questions remain			2
" reinstating the band prior to these issues being resolved would sidestep efforts under way , which could impact the band 's long - term survival , " @entity177 said in his response to @entity1 ' letter			1
" reconciling these and other issues under investigation will ensure that the institution 's operational priorities and controls are in place			0
" the school is working on a plan to provide entertainment during home football games , as well as at two " classics " events at which the @entity203 has been a fixture , @entity1 said			0
despite its name , the band has about 420 members , according to the school			0
it was not immediately clear what impact the decision would have on band members attending the school on a band scholarship			0
@entity1 noted that band scholarships require students to perform publicly in addition to classwork , and all bands featuring marching 100 members have been suspended			0
but he said other bands and ensembles that do not have marching band members on their rosters will be allowed to continue to perform			0
throughout the school 's history , the @entity203 , which incorporates dance moves into traditional marching formations , has been a source of pride for the school			0
it has played in inaugural parades for presidents @entity233 and @entity234 and in several @entity235			0
in 1985 , the band won @entity237 , awarded annually by the @entity238 to " collegiate marching bands of particular excellence			0
