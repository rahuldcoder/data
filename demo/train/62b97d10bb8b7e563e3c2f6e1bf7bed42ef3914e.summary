" all along , these negotiations have been about a choice for @entity1 's leaders , " he wrote			1
" they can agree to the steps necessary to assure the world that their country 's nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful and not be used to build a weapon , or they can squander a historic opportunity to end @entity1 's economic and diplomatic isolation and improve the lives of their people			1
" diplomacy and leadership are marked by tough calls			0
