even after the identification of the @entity3 bombing suspects through grainy security - camera images , officials say that blanketing a city in surveillance cameras can create as many problems as it solves			1
a network of cameras on city streets and other public spaces increases the chances of capturing a criminal on video but can generate an overwhelming amount of evidence to sift through			1
the cameras make some people feel more secure , knowing that bad guys are being watched			2
but privacy advocates and other citizens are uneasy with the idea that @entity24 is monitoring their every public move			0
meanwhile , facial - recognition software and other technologies are making security - camera images more valuable to law enforcement			1
now , software can automatically mine surveillance footage for information , such as a specific person 's face , and create a giant searchable database			1
after last week 's bombings at the @entity39 , authorities had to sift through a mountain of footage from government surveillance cameras , private security cameras and imagery shot by bystanders on smartphones			1
it took the @entity48 only three days to release blurry shots of the two suspects , taken by a department store 's cameras			1
compare their quick turnaround with the 2005 @entity56 bombings , when it took thousands of investigators weeks to parse the city 's @entity59 ( closed - circuit television ) footage after the attacks			1
the cameras , software and algorithms have come a long way in eight years			1
cities under surveillance in major cities , in the age of terrorism , someone is almost always watching			1
the cameras used in @entity56 are part of the city 's extensive and sophisticated " @entity76 " surveillance system that combines nearly a half million cameras , roadblocks and license plate readers to monitor the heart of the city			1
set up in 1998 , the system is one of the most advanced in the world and allows authorities to track anyone going into or out of central @entity56			1
many residents question the effectiveness of @entity56 's system , however			2
in 2008 , only one crime was solved for every 1,000 cameras , according to the city 's police			2
@entity59 cameras across @entity97 also cost authorities nearly $ 800 million over the past four years , according to civil liberties group @entity99			2
modeled after @entity56 's system , @entity101 's @entity100 monitors 4,000 security cameras and license plate readers south of @entity104			1
the project uses feeds from both private and public security cameras , which are are all monitored 24 hours a day by the @entity108			2
using face and object - detection technology , the police can track cars and people moving through 1.7 square miles in lower @entity114 and even detect unattended packages			1
the $ 150 million initiative also includes a number of radiation detectors and automatic roadblocks that can can be used to stop traffic in an emergency			0
@entity3 's camera network is smaller than those in @entity56 and @entity101 , though that is likely to change soon			1
in 2007 , @entity3 law enforcement had an estimated 55 cctv cameras set up around the city			1
since then , the city has expanded its surveillance system , though authorities there are not commenting on the exact scope of the current camera setup			2
@entity3 's example has shown the power of these systems to help solve crimes , causing many to call for even more cameras			1
but it 's still not clear whether they are effective at preventing crimes			0
according to the @entity142 at @entity143 in @entity144 , urban surveillance systems have not been proven to have any effect on deterring criminals			0
facial recognition as the volume and quality of cameras and sensors are ramped up , cities are turning to more advanced face - and object - recognition software to makes sense of the data			1
" we describe what 's in the video , and we store that in a database , " said @entity156 , ceo of @entity158 - based @entity157 , one of several companies that makes this type of facial - recognition technology			1
the company 's first investor was @entity168 , the @entity169 's venture - capital arm , which finds and funds promising security - related technology			1
now , @entity157 works with federal and local law enforcement agencies , as well as private companies and banks			0
its software can identify objects by shape , size and color			2
it can read license plates and recognize cars			0
when it comes to people , it can detect their gender , approximate age , mood and other demographic information			1
using multiple cameras , it can track their patterns and some behaviors			0
it automatically zooms in on any person 's face and identifies them based on things like the distance between their eyes or the shape of their nose			0
all that information is stored in a database			0
big clues that would take a traditional investigator untold hours of watching video to uncover can be found with a 15 - second search query			2
opinion : surveillance state no answer to terror for example , they could do a search for anyone who entered a @entity217 between 8 and 11 p.m. on a specific night , pull up the times that certain cars have entered and left a parking lot , or ask for images of every person who has entered a certain building over the past year			0
" it instantaneously gives you a picture of everybody who has walked in the door in the past based on the geometries of their face , " @entity156 said			0
privacy concerns civil - liberties activists are concerned about how this technology could be abused			2
with cameras in far - flung cities all connecting to the same database , a person 's movements can be tracked across states or continents			1
for example , it could be used to single out a person attending multiple political protests			0
" we like to think we have some privacy in our lives , that we can go places that we do n't necessarily want the government to know about , " said said @entity253 , an attorney at the @entity254 , an @entity255 civil - liberties group			0
" what concerns me is if all of those cameras get linked together at some point , and if we apply facial recognition on the back end , we 'll be able to track people wherever they go			1
" for now , many of the biometrics databases in the @entity266 are still separated			0
some are scattered across various federal and local government agencies , and connecting them will take time and big budgets			0
the @entity48 is in the process of building out its own facial - recognition database and is working with state dmvs to access their photos			1
it 's less likely the government will be able to tap into private databases anytime soon , but it 's still a cause for concern down the line , privacy advocates say			0
@entity282 has the largest facial - recognition database in the world , a potentially rich vein of data for any government agency			1
another worry is the misidentification of suspects			0
@entity156 acknowledges that these systems can make mistakes but says the computers are n't there to take over for humans but to assist investigators by weeding out useless information			0
" the cameras themselves are not a panacea			0
they 're not going to solve the problem			0
it 's one of the steps , " he said			0
but at least one prominent tech blogger thinks the benefits of surveillance cameras outweigh our fears about privacy			2
" the idea of submitting to constant monitoring feels wrong , nearly un-american , to most of us			0
cameras in the sky are the ultimate manifestation of @entity24 -- way for the government to watch you all the time , everywhere , " @entity314 wrote last week in @entity315			0
but @entity314 thinks we need to be thinking about ways to make cameras work for us , not reasons to abolish them			0
" when you weigh cameras against other security measures , they emerge as the least costly and most effective choice			2
in the aftermath of 9/11 , we 've turned most public spaces into fortresses -- now , it 's impossible for you to get into tall buildings , airports , many museums , concerts , and even public celebrations without being subjected to pat - downs and metal detectors			0
when combined with competent law enforcement , surveillance cameras are more effective , less intrusive , less psychologically draining , and much more pleasant than these alternatives			2

new technology makes it easier to identify suspects in surveillance photos and video
the @entity3 bombing suspects were identified on security - camera footage
cities such as @entity101 and @entity56 now have thousands of cameras on the streets
facial - recognition software can detect age , gender and even moods
