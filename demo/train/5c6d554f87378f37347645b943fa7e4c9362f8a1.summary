-- i 'm fairly certain there 's nothing haunting my house , save maybe the leftover @entity7 cheese dip still in the fridge			1
but so far , its intentions seem friendly			2
you just have to ignore the constant paranoid screams from the tofu			2
" it wants my soul ! " " shut up , tofu			2
" it 's not entirely uncommon for me to have these lively conversations with my food			1
i probably need a girlfriend			2
fortunately , though , since the worst of my supernatural household concerns is confined to the lingering spirit of old @entity26 , i do sleep fairly well at night in the 2 square feet of bed space kindly allotted to me by my dog			2
quite simply , i respect the demon cheese			2
the demon cheese respects me			2
and my dog respects nobody			2
which is far better than what could have been said of two flatmates in @entity35 who recently sold an antique mirror on @entity37 because they were convinced it was haunted and willfully endangering their lives			1
" i 'm going to murder both of you			0
" " but , @entity43 , we saved you from the trash heap ! " " @entity46			1
" according to their @entity37 listing , it all started when one of them saw that the building 's landlord had put the old hallway mirror out on the lawn as rubbish			1
so , being resourceful , he retrieved it , added some silver paint and leaned it up against their wall above the radiator			0
soon after that , things supposedly got weird			0
" we both experienced what i can only describe as intense sharp stabbing pains , " the sellers wrote to prospective buyers			0
" they would strike us both at the same time			0
" the two flatmates also complained of waking up completely drained of energy , screaming in the early morning hours with horrible feelings of impending doom			0
though , to be fair , that kind of sounds like my typical weekday			0
only with fewer tears and significantly less self - doubt			0
regardless , this is the point where one of them should have turned to the other and asked , " how about we just ... throw it away ? " but , that would be too logical			0
and , besides , the sudden emergence of blood was sort of interesting and new			0
you see , in addition to growing increasingly sick and depressed from all the evil hauntings , one of the flatmates even claims to have woken up with deep body scratches , for which he blamed the mirror and kindly provided a link on @entity37 for photographic proof			1
it 's also entirely possible that he just has a pet cat			1
or , perhaps , an amazing lover			0
( but not like that			0
) of course , any potential buyer would need to believe such humorous nonsense as haunting pains and bloody scratches in the night			0
they , presumably , would also require an itchy @entity108 trigger finger			0
the kind that leads you to bid on a used toilet brush at 3 in the morning			0
" booya ! who 's the wild man now ? " with the mirror , it was all about finding that absolutely perfect buyer , and the sellers noted that they " would ideally like it to go to somebody who has experience with the paranormal / supernatural and knows what they are getting themselves in for			1
" amazingly , thanks to the powers of the interwebs , there was no shortage of interest			0
and for everyone 's amusement , a few potential bidders began asking entirely reasonable questions of the sellers : " i 'd like to buy this as a present			1
if i win the auction is there any way you could deliver it to my ex for me ? " eventually , the mirror sold for Â £ 100 , or a little over $ 150			1
so , good on them			1
as a result , i plan to list everything i sell in the future as potentially haunted			1
" but this is n't just any @entity152 cd			0
it 's a * haunted * @entity152 cd			1
" in the end , it does n't really matter whether the mirror was evil or if their stories were even mildly believable			1
what matters is that somebody paid for the simple possibility			1
it 's important to have a few good conversation pieces sitting around the house , and nothing sounds better than explaining how you bought a haunted mirror off two random guys on @entity37			1
which is why , if anyone 's interested , i now have some leftover @entity7 cheese dip for sale			1
it comes with a free @entity152 cd .			0
