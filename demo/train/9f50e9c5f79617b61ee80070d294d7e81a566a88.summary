@entity0 will go to the polls on saturday to elect their second president since the overthrow of the @entity4 in the winter of 2001			1
you might be wondering : why bother ? after all , doom and gloom are supposedly the order of the day in @entity0			2
a @entity12 / @entity11 poll in january found that slightly more than half of @entity14 believe the @entity14 has mostly failed to achieve its goals in @entity0			1
a month earlier , a @entity17 poll found that the @entity18 might well be the most unpopular war in @entity14 history			1
an overwhelming 82 % of @entity14 are now opposed to the war			1
( at the start of 2014 , the @entity14 had 38,000 troops in @entity0			1
) @entity24 predictions of a civil war breaking out after the withdrawal of @entity14 and other @entity28 combat troops from @entity0 at the end of 2014 have been a staple in the @entity14 media for years , including in quite sensible publications such as the @entity33			1
but a surprisingly under - reported set of developments has been taking place over the past several weeks in @entity0 ahead of saturday 's presidential election			1
it shows that @entity0 are not preparing for another civil war and instead a large majority of @entity0 are planning to participate in the first democratic transition of power in @entity0 history , while the presidential candidates are engaged in the kind of campaigning and deal - making that would gladden the heart of @entity49			1
despite the entirely predictable efforts of the @entity4 to disrupt the run up to the election , there is still likely to be a big turn out on @entity55			1
a suicide bomber wearing a military uniform , for instance , killed six police officers on wednesday inside the @entity60 , which is both well protected and in the heart of downtown @entity63			0
even with the @entity4 violence , recent polling by the @entity65 of @entity0 found that 75 % of @entity0 said they wanted to vote			1
that is essentially the same finding of a separate poll taken almost a year ago that found that 76 % of @entity0 planned to vote			2
even allowing for some drop - off on @entity55 , most @entity0 experts i have talked to believe the turnout will likely be in the 60 % to 70 % range			2
turnout in the previous presidential election in 2009 was only around 30 %			0
by contrast , the last time a @entity14 presidential election had a 60 % turnout was in 1968 , and the last time it was above 70 % was in 1900			1
the high voter turnout estimates are based on the great excitement the @entity0 elections have engendered			2
there have been substantive televised debates between the leading candidates , an astonishing development when you recall that under the @entity4 it was only 13 years ago that television was banned entirely			1
indeed , under the @entity4 there was no media to speak of beyond @entity94 , which dispensed grim @entity4 propaganda			2
@entity0 's now - vibrant media -- today there 75 television channels and 175 radio stations , as well as hundreds of print publications -- is giving the presidential campaign wall - to - wall coverage			2
meanwhile , the presidential candidates are addressing vast rallies across the country			0
there has also has been real @entity106 - style political horse - trading during the campaign			0
candidates with little public support , such as @entity110 , president @entity112 's brother ( and in another life , a restaurateur in @entity114 ) , recently ended his presidential bid and threw his support to another candidate , a former foreign minister , @entity118			2
despite much fretting that president @entity112 would publicly endorse one of the eight candidates still in the running , he has n't done so and his supposedly preferred candidate , @entity118 , came in a distant third in a poll released over the weekend			2
most impressively , the two campaigns that are consistently leading in the several polls taken during the past weeks have crossed ethnic lines to form their tickets			0
top presidential contender @entity130 , who earned his ph.d. at @entity132 , is from the @entity134 ethnic group and he is running with @entity135 as his no. 2 , a leader of the @entity138 ethnic group			0
the other front - runner is dr. @entity140 who is identified with the @entity142 ethnic group ( despite the fact that his parents are @entity142 and @entity134 )			0
@entity140 is partnered with @entity145 , a leader of the @entity146 , and he also has a @entity134 on the ticket , @entity148 , who is affiliated with @entity149 , a splinter group of the @entity4			2
importantly , neither of the front - runners is an old school warlord			0
indeed , they are both impressive technocrats			0
@entity140 is an eye doctor by training who became @entity0 's most capable foreign minister under president @entity112			1
@entity130 was the country 's most able finance minister , also under president @entity112			0
both these candidates can credibly promise sorely needed good governance in @entity0 should they assume the presidency			2
of course , there are caveats to all this			0
the 2009 presidential election was marred by massive fraud			0
could this happen again ? this is much less likely for several reasons : there is considerably more local media attention about this issue than was the case five years ago ; there have been several nationwide polls in the run - up to this election that establish quite firmly that @entity130 and @entity140 are the front - runners , so fraudulently fixing some other candidate to take the lead would be hard to accomplish , and all the major candidates will have their representatives at the thousands of polling stations across the country , according to a senior @entity0 official			1
could @entity4 violence keep voters away on @entity55 ? maybe in some places , but @entity14 , @entity28 and @entity0 forces have long planned for this day , so expect to see a comprehensive security plan in place			1
according to the senior @entity0 official , @entity0 's borders with neighboring @entity192 will be sealed to the extent possible on polling day so as to prevent any @entity4 insurgents or suicide bombers crossing over from @entity192 into @entity0			1
the official says @entity198 will also be closed			0
a wild card that could upset the election process would be violence against one of the well - guarded leading contenders			0
@entity140 's motorcade was attacked by unknown assailants in february			0
@entity0 election law requires the winning presidential candidate to obtain more than 50 % of the votes to win			2
given that there are eight candidates still in the field , such an outcome seems unlikely			0
that means the two top candidates from saturday 's voting will go to a runoff election			0
according to the senior @entity0 official , the runoff will likely take place on june 20			0
all the major candidates have said they will sign the @entity221 , or @entity222 , with the @entity14 that would allow @entity14 troops to be based in @entity0 in an advisory capacity for many years after the withdrawal of @entity14 combat troops at the end of 2014			1
@entity112 has famously refused to sign the agreement			0
most @entity0 want the @entity222 , because they see even a relatively small presence of @entity14 soldiers and other @entity28 allies as a guarantor of the country 's stability			1
as one senior @entity0 official put it to me when discussing the hoped - for long - term presence of @entity14 troops , " we can either be @entity235 or we can be @entity236			1
" it 's obvious that most @entity0 prefer the latter outcome			0
under a @entity14 security umbrella , over the past several decades @entity236 went from being one of the poorest countries in the world to one of the richest			0
though @entity112 has been criticized by president @entity250 and members of @entity252 for not signing the @entity222 , in fact he has actually done the long - term relationship between @entity0 and the @entity14 a distinct favor , because the @entity222 will now be signed by the winner of the presidential election , a politician who will have a substantial mandate from the @entity0 people , rather than by @entity112 , who is at this point the lamest of ducks			1
what of the @entity4 ? well , they regard elections as against @entity263 , so they will write themselves out of this historic event and will only be seen by most @entity0 as spoilers who will try to interrupt the election			1
and in a significant turn of events , the @entity192 military is preparing a large - scale military operation along the @entity0 - @entity192 border into the @entity192 tribal area of @entity274 , which has long been a sanctuary for the most virulent branch of the @entity4 , the @entity276			1
according to two @entity14 officials who closely follow @entity192 , the @entity192 military is geared up for this operation in a manner that is unprecedented , and it is only the civilian political leadership that is dithering about whether to pull the trigger			0
the @entity14 made a fundamental error when it conceived that real peace in @entity0 , which has been wracked by three decades of war , centered on doing some kind of deal with the @entity4			1
as a result , well - intentioned @entity14 officials put a great deal of diplomatic effort into trying to negotiate some kind of peace deal with the @entity4			1
absolutely nothing has come of this multiyear effort , which was always a pipe dream , as i predicted in this space three years ago			0
the negotiations with the @entity4 were known in @entity299 circles as " the reconciliation process			0
" in fact , the real reconciliation process is what you will see in @entity0 on saturday : huge turnout by voters across the country voting across ethnic lines for seasoned politicians who have partnered with leaders of other ethnic groups			2
this is n't the predicted civil war ; it 's more like a civics love fest. if only we could try to import some of this spirit into the @entity252 .			0

@entity14 are *dubious* about the @entity0 war , questioning what it achieved
@entity322 says attention should be paid to the robust election campaign
candidates seeking to succeed @entity112 are debating , voters are listening , he says
@entity330 : despite @entity4 , @entity0 could see its first democratic transfer of power
