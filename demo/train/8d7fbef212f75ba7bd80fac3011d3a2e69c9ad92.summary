at the @entity1 , @entity0 said he would commentate on his head if @entity4 won a fourth - set tiebreak after falling behind 6 - 0 to fellow @entity7 @entity6			1
guess what ? it happened			0
@entity4 claimed the next eight points and @entity0 did as he promised in a later match at the season 's final major			0
no commentators were believed to have said something similar when @entity16 trailed @entity17 5 - 0 and 6 - 2 in a fourth - set tiebreak monday at the @entity19 -- and lucky for them			1
just like @entity21 , @entity16 did the almost unthinkable and pulled off a great escape			1
the defending champion at the year 's opening grand slam saved five set points in the tiebreak to close out the encounter against the @entity27 7 - 6 ( 2 ) 6 - 4 4 - 6 7 - 6 ( 8 ) and advance to the quarterfinals			1
" losing 5 - 0 was a bad start to the tiebreak , " @entity16 , upset by @entity17 at the @entity29 , told reporters			1
" at 6 - 2 i knew it was close to come back because i had the wind with me			2
" i had to focus on every point			0
i knew if i was going to come back ( to ) 6 - 5 , ( he ) was going to get nervous			2
just focused point after point			0
" @entity16 is flying the @entity41 flag after @entity43 's surprising loss to @entity44 in the third round and the world @entity46 will have to maintain , or increase , his level if he is to continue his winning streak at @entity50			1
@entity16 's quarterfinal opponent , @entity52 , beat the 29 - year - old in the last eight in september en route to making the final at the @entity57			1
" i 'm happy the way i 'm playing so far , " @entity16 said			1
" i 'm ready for the tournament			0
i did n't spend too much energy on the court since one week			0
" i 'm happy to get the chance to play one more quarterfinal			0
" @entity52 did something rare later monday on @entity67 when he downed @entity68 6 - 3 6 - 3 6 - 3			2
only @entity69 and @entity70 had beaten the @entity27 -- one of the game 's top competitors -- in straight sets at a hard - court or clay - court major since the beginning of 2011			1
it was also the first time @entity52 defeated @entity68 in straight sets , his previous six victories all going the distance			0
@entity82 , going for a fifth @entity19 title , will take on @entity84 's @entity83 in the quarterfinals			1
@entity70 overcame @entity86 in straight sets			1
@entity83 , meanwhile , eliminated @entity87 in five sets			0
@entity17 saved match points in two encounters earlier in the fortnight and saved another versus @entity83 in the fourth set			2
but @entity83 took the fifth 6 - 3 to prevent a rare hat - trick			2
another early wobble for @entity96 for the third straight match , women 's top - seed @entity96 survived an early wobble to progress			1
she saved three set points in the first set against @entity104 , lost the first set against @entity106 and then lost the first set to @entity108 -- her conqueror at the @entity29 -- on monday			1
but @entity96 upped her game despite dealing with a cough and got a bit of luck in the third set to oust the big , flat - hitting 24th - seed 2 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 2 in the fourth round			1
" i 've been playing for a long time , " @entity96 , bidding for a 19th major but first in @entity117 in five years , told reporters			2
" when i have to go up a level , i have to			0
" i ca n't afford to stay at the same level or i will be where i was at the @entity29			0
i definitely did n't want to be there without at least trying to give 1000 %			0
" still the match might have turned out differently had @entity108 not missed a routine volley on break point when leading 1 - 0 in the third			1
" i knew that if i won this game , i would have more chances to win the third set , because ( to ) break her serve , it 's difficult , " said @entity108			1
" i wanted to use that opportunity , but i could n't			0
" @entity96 returned to the @entity131 later on monday , rooting on older sister @entity132			2
and she left in good spirits , since @entity134 upset sixth - seed @entity135 6 - 3 2 - 6 6 - 1 to make a first grand slam quarterfinal in five years			0
@entity134 , too , had n't beaten a top - 10 player at a major since the @entity138			0
" she really had answers for everything today , " said @entity135			0
when @entity141 upset @entity142 in the second round , most would have expected @entity96 to face the two - time @entity19 winner in the quarterfinals			1
but @entity146 did n't read the script			2
the 2013 finalist defeated @entity141 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 3			0
@entity149 -- who sent @entity151 champion @entity150 packing -- reached her first grand slam quarterfinal by beating compatriot @entity154 6 - 2 6 - 4 .			0

@entity16 drops his first set at the @entity19
but the @entity41 **rallies** in a fourth - set tiebreak to advance
@entity96 also **rallies** , against @entity108
@entity70 and @entity146 progress to the quarterfinals , too
