@entity1 , @entity0 on this photo which shows how similar the pair look			0
but if you were to venture on set during the filming of " @entity13 " hoping to catch a few moments with the star you might have had a surprise			0
the tall , rangy man in the dented hat signing autographs could just as easily have been @entity29 's stunt double , @entity14			1
back then , in the right light @entity14 could easily be mistaken for @entity29 -- both of them over six feet tall and bronzed with crinkly eyes			1
and it 's this that is at the root of his success as @entity8 's " fall guy			1
" in fact , @entity29 is a talented stuntman in his own right and @entity14 says that his biggest headache on set was trying to stop @entity29 from getting involved in action that was too risky			1
" the biggest stunt i always say on the @entity8 films was stopping @entity9 doing the stunts because i had to fight nearly every time to stop him , " @entity14 chuckles			1
an accomplished horseman ( his first career choice was steeplechase jockey ) , it 's @entity14 's @entity8 you see galloping along in the stained khaki shirt and jumping from his horse onto a tank in " @entity57			1
" " technically very difficult , " @entity14 says , " i had to rely on a horse , and horses have a sense of survival and they do n't actually do what you tell them to do as they have n't read the script			2
" it may have been his close resemblance to @entity29 that clinched the " @entity13 " job but the pair developed a rapport that led @entity14 to work on the other two installments of the trilogy , " @entity73 " and " @entity57			1
" " it always works better if you do have a relationship with [ the actor ]			2
you can mimic how they move , how they work when you coordinate fights for them like i did with @entity9 , " @entity14 tells @entity2			1
@entity14 was just 16 years old when he started in the stunt industry in 1965			1
he utilised his horseriding skills to double as @entity85 in spy movie " @entity87			2
" he had to jump a huge moat and then fall off his mount but it was the simple lifestyle and travel that hooked young @entity14 -- " forty dollars a day and all you can eat			1
" after over 40 years and countless movies , his filmography reads like a who 's who of @entity96 : he has doubled for @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and collaborated with directors like @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and sir @entity104			1
his work for three decades on classic bond films like " @entity107 " and " @entity108 " cemented his reputation as a stuntman who could pull off complicated of stunts with precision			2
" the films i 've done i 've been very lucky to have been very prolific in an area and a time when iconic films were being made			0
" my first stunt on a @entity119 film was in 1966 in the winter of " @entity107 "			0
i was one of the ninjas coming down firing guns into the volcano , which for me was sensational			0
" he doubled for @entity124 in " @entity108 " for a short while and was then propelled into working as a stunt coordinator and director of action units			0
@entity14 then added a superhero to his already impressive roster of action idols , standing in for @entity131 in " superman			2
" despite this , his allegiances lie solidly with cinema 's ' real ' heroes			0
" if you look at " @entity140 " and movies like that , or the " @entity141 , " they are far more computer - generated and so therefore slightly more cartoonish or video game - ish			0
" my personal preference is for real action just enhanced or maybe helped by computers			0
we use computers to take away fall pads or wires if you 're getting snatched or thrown in the air			0
" and in the spirit of keeping it real , @entity14 has gone to great lengths to help stuntmen achieve their crazy feats as safely as possible			2
in the 1980s he modified a tool known as the " fan descender " for the film " @entity161			0
" it would allow stuntmen to safely slow down when performing high freefalls			0
it revolutionized the stunt industry and in 2002 he was awarded a @entity167 for his invention -- the only one ever handed out to a stunt man			0
earlier this year , he was honored by the @entity170 for his work on 2007 action horror " @entity173			0
" he has just finished work on " @entity175 " -- it was his prior commitment to this movie that stopped him working on the fourth @entity8 film " @entity177 " -- and is now stunt coordinating on the @entity179 production " @entity180			2
" even after all this time , @entity14 , the authority on how to create a death defying stunt , still reckons @entity29 is the best stuntman actor he has ever worked with -- " @entity9 has to be the ultimate			1
" so why bother with a stunt double ? " i was cheaper and it did n't matter if i got hurt			1

@entity14 was @entity9 's stunt double in the @entity8 movies
his *physical* similarity to @entity29 is at the root of his success as @entity8 's " fall guy "
after 40 years in the business , @entity14 is the authority on death defying stunts
