-- beyond a vague familiarity with the world 's major airlines , most travelers know little about the hundreds of carriers transporting passengers across the globe			2
sunday 's deadly air crash in @entity9 raises questions about the safety of international airlines			1
so how do passengers find safety information ? there are several things travelers should look for to gauge an airline 's safety , according to @entity20 , ceo of the @entity21 , an international nonprofit organization			1
in short , you 're looking for a category 1 ranking from the @entity24 and registration with the @entity26 , an international trade group			1
membership with a major airline alliance helps , and you likely want to avoid airlines banned by the @entity30			1
the @entity24 looks at international aviation regulators			1
the @entity24 program assesses the safety standards of the civil aviation authorities of countries with airlines operating in the @entity37			1
" we look at the ability of the aviation authority in the country to administer its aviation community in accordance with international regulations			1
we do n't look at individual airlines , " said @entity24 spokesman @entity45			1
countries with aviation authorities that meet standards set by the @entity50 receive a category 1 ranking			1
those that do n't receive a category 2 designation			0
@entity9 , the site of the crash that killed more than 160 people , has a category 1 ranking			0
twenty - five nations , nearly a quarter of those assessed , hold a category 2 ranking , including the @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			0
the @entity50 , the @entity67 agency that defines international standards , also focuses oversight on regulators rather than airlines			1
the agency has conducted mandatory safety audits of the civil aviation authorities of member countries since 1999			1
most countries publish the audits , but it 's not mandatory , " and the ones that you really want to see are the ones that do n't publish , " @entity20 said			0
despite occasional catastrophic crashes , airline accident rates have seen " massive improvements " in the last few decades , he said			2
the global accident rate for commercial air service fluctuated between 3.9 and 4.6 accidents per million departures between 2005 and 2010 , according to @entity50			0
the agency 's 2011 figures have not been released			0
in 2010 , the global rate was four accidents per million departures			0
@entity92 had the highest regional accident rate in 2010 of 16.8 , four times the global average , but @entity92 accounts for the lowest percentage of global traffic volume			0
@entity98 's accident rate , 3.3 per million departures , was below the world average in 2010			0
the region had the highest number of accidents -- 35 -- but no fatalities			0
@entity105 also had an accident rate of 3.3 per million departures with 24 accidents , two of which included fatalities			0
the trade group @entity26 does its own safety audits on air carriers			1
the organization 's registry is searchable by airline			2
all of the association 's more than 240 member airlines must meet audit standards to maintain membership			2
" ( @entity121 ) who are @entity26 member carriers actually have a far better safety rate than the industry standard , " @entity20 said			2
@entity125 , the @entity9 carrier involved in sunday 's crash , does not appear on the registry			0
@entity20 said the carrier may have chosen not to be audited or may not have passed			2
the cause of sunday 's accident in @entity9 is still unknown			0
the @entity30 's " black list " provides another safety benchmark			1
the @entity30 takes a more aggressive approach to screening individual carriers and has banned more than 280 airlines from 25 nations from operating within the @entity30 since 2006			1
@entity92 , @entity65 and @entity60 airlines figure prominently on the @entity30 's banned list , as do carriers in @entity139 and @entity140			1
the @entity30 also has a list of carriers subject to operational restrictions			1
no @entity9 airlines appear on either list			2
membership in a major alliance , including @entity148 , @entity149 and oneworld , can also be considered a reassurance to nervous travelers , @entity20 said			0
member airlines tend to monitor each other , reinforcing high safety standards			2
there are no guarantees , but air travel is still much safer than other means of transportation			0
" particularly in the developing world , you have to look at how extraordinarily safe aviation is			0
even though an airline might appear a little risky by your @entity167 standards , it could easily be 1,000 times safer than taking the same trip on the road , " @entity20 said .			0

international regulators have lists and registries dedicated to airline safety
the @entity24 rates international aviation authorities
the @entity30 has a list of airlines banned from operating in the @entity30
many airlines are audited and registered with an international trade group
