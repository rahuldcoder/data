-- in a 5 - 4 decision , @entity1 on wednesday struck down limits on the total amount people can donate to various political campaigns in an election season , a blow to federal election laws ahead of november 's congressional midterm elections			1
@entity10 , @entity0 senior legal analyst , answers some questions about how this ruling works and its possible consequences			2
what exactly does this ruling do ? are some limits still in place ? the court left intact the law that sets a $ 5,200 limit on the amount individuals can give to any single candidate in a campaign cycle , but struck down the $ 123,000 aggregate limit an individual can give to candidates in that time period			1
wednesday 's ruling declares the $ 123,200 limit unconstitutional			0
so now individuals can give up to $ 5,200 to as many candidates as they like			1
does this mean money will influence campaigns more than ever ? who is most likely to gain ? the decision gives rich people more power to influence campaigns			1
it expands the influence of people who have a lot of money to give			1
the end of the $ 123,200 overall limit means that people who have even more money to spend have more ways to spend it			2
is this a @entity52 issue ? the protection of political speech ? chief justice @entity56 ' opinion said that campaign contributions can be regulated by @entity58 , but only under narrow circumstances			2
the only permissible laws ban what the court calls quid pro quo corruption -- in other words , bribes in the form of campaign contributions			0
because spreading the money around to lots of candidates does not present the risk of bribes to any individual candidate , according to the court , the overall limits had to be struck down			2
how does this compare with @entity76 ? this decision is similar to @entity76 , with a similar rationale			0
@entity76 was the 2010 @entity1 ruling that paved the way for political donations from corporations and special interest groups			2
the @entity56 court believes in a simple idea -- spending money in political campaigns is the equivalent of political speech			1
because the @entity52 prohibits most limits on speech , most limits on political contributions are in the process of being struck down			0
what does this means for the future of campaign finance ? the next big question is whether the court will also strike down the $ 5,200 limit on individual contributions			1
in fact , very few people ran up against the $ 123,200 limit , so the practical effect of wednesday 's decision is limited			0
but lots of people give up to $ 5,200			1
ending that limit would have a huge impact on political campaigns			2
what are the chances of the court ending the $ 5,200 limit ? justice @entity117 said in a separate concurring opinion wednesday that he thought the court should get rid of the $ 5,200 limit , but no other justices joined him -- yet			1
the decision was 5 - 4 , so the four dissenters want to preserve campaign finance limits			0
the real question is whether the four other justices in the majority will join @entity117			0
it 's hard to say			0
what 's clear is that the court is looking for new ways to stop the regulation of political contributions -- and it 's already stopped a lot of them			0
what 's behind all these decisions ? the core idea of the five justices in the majority is that spending money on political campaigns is a form of speech			1
the @entity52 strictly limits regulation of speech			0
once you believe that money is speech , most campaign finance limits become unconstitutional .			0

high court struck down $ 123,000 overall limit you can give candidates in an election
@entity10 : ruling expands influence of rich people most likely to run up against a limit
@entity10 : @entity1 left intact $ 5,200 limit on what you can give to one candidate
majority sees money in political campaigns as the equivalent of political speech , he says
