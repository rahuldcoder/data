@entity0 , @entity1 -- camouflage - clad militiamen hoist @entity6 assault rifles to their shoulders and blast off a 21 - shot salute			1
as the muzzles flash , another squad of ultra-nationalist fighters chants , " our hero is not dead			0
" a few yards away , a @entity1 @entity15 priest swings an incense burner			2
a mother and father weep over the coffin of their dead son			0
the killing of radical nationalist leader @entity23 , also known by his nickname " @entity25 " was enough to make shaven - headed , hardened paramilitary men cry			1
" he was like a brother to me and my comrades			0
but that bastard @entity32 murdered him , " said @entity30 , as he choked back tears			2
@entity30 served under @entity23 , who was commander in western @entity1 for the " @entity34 , " a recently formed alliance of right - wing and nationalist political parties and militia forces			1
@entity1 's @entity39 said its special agents killed @entity41 monday night here in the western city of @entity0 as he resisted arrest			1
the @entity39 says he was a gangster			0
but @entity34 leaders are calling for the interior minister @entity46 to resign and face murder charges over @entity23 's death			2
they say the @entity46 is one of @entity1 's corrupt old - guard politicians and that he and his men may even have been taking orders from @entity52			1
whatever the true details of his @entity23 's death , it is a sign that political partners in the new @entity1 may have old scores to settle -- divisions that @entity52 may be poised to exploit			1
@entity23 and the @entity34 are credited with playing a lead role in this winter 's protests that toppled @entity1 president @entity62			1
the nationalist paramilitary militias won admiration from many ordinary @entity1 for their stiff discipline and determined street - fighting tactics			1
@entity67 , an @entity68 - speaking interpreter , had made the three - and - a - half hour drive from the capital to @entity0 to be at the funeral wednesday			0
she said she met @entity23 only once , at the barricades around @entity74 's emblematic @entity73 or " @entity73 , " the scene of the deadliest clashes between anti-government protestors and @entity62 's security forces in january and february			2
" he was a national hero			1
he 's an inspiration for millions of @entity1 people , especially young people			2
he 's a local @entity82 , " @entity67 said @entity23 , 52 , reveled in his tough - guy image			1
his @entity85 page is plastered with images of him , crop - haired in combat fatigues giving a raised - arm , clenched fist salute			0
others show him relaxing in his favorite @entity92 cap and jacket			0
according to his comrades , he led a small unit of @entity1 nationalists to fight alongside @entity98 rebels against the @entity99			1
in contrast , elderly women on the sidelines of his funeral attested to @entity23 's " @entity82 " character			1
they said he and his men had campaigned heavily for better pension rights for old people across the region			0
paramilitary units under the umbrella of the @entity34 have sparked the alarm of @entity99 president @entity32			1
@entity32 says he fears that these nationalist groups , which he refers to as " fascists , " will hunt down and attack ethnic - @entity99 living in @entity1			1
is @entity99 done after @entity114 ? in the wake of the overthrow of the @entity62 regime , no such widespread incidents have been reported			2
but @entity32 used this as a pretext to forcibly annex the @entity1 region of @entity114			1
now , according to the @entity123 , there are an estimated 30,000 @entity99 troops , armed with heavy artillery and tanks , massing along @entity1 's eastern border			1
the @entity1 government puts the figure even higher			2
@entity131 and @entity132 officials say the @entity99 could roll into @entity1 any time , without warning in a bid to annex @entity99 - speaking areas of eastern @entity1 or even push into @entity135 , a disputed enclave in the former @entity137 republic of @entity138			1
@entity1 troops in @entity114 opted not to defend their bases in the face of advancing @entity99 forces			1
instead they surrendered naval , air and army facilities one by one or waited until they were overrun			0
@entity1 's @entity146 estimates up to 75 % of the approximately 15,000 troops based there may have defected to the @entity99			1
but in an interview with @entity2 , the top national leader of @entity34 , @entity149 said fighters under his command would not stand by if @entity32 ordered the @entity99 army into other parts of @entity1			1
" @entity156 will do its best to launch a partisan , guerrilla war			0
the land will literally burn under the feet of the invaders			0
we will not be lambs to the slaughter			0
we will defend our independence by any means necessary , " he said			0
despite fears @entity1 government security forces could target other @entity34 leaders , @entity149 made the trip to @entity0 to march alongside @entity23 's coffin			1
he was flanked by black - clad bodyguards , one brandishing a @entity99 - made machine - pistol , the other a high - powered sniper rifle			2
@entity149 , too , blamed @entity99 sympathizers within the @entity39 for killing @entity23			1
@entity1 's @entity178 ousts minister ; military upgrade wanted the popularity of @entity34 and @entity1 's radical nationalist groups was bolstered so significantly in the anti-government protests that @entity149 thinks he has a real chance at winning the presidency in elections in may			1
but he stresses personal power is not his main ambition			0
" the presidential post is not the goal in itself			0
we understand we may win or we may lose			0
this post offers the possibility to bring quality and systematic changes to the country as well as the possibility to ' reload ' the power structure so there is the change of elites not just a change of faces , " @entity149 said			0
but the rise of @entity34 is not only worrying @entity52 but also some @entity207 government officials			0
some believe @entity34 is a safe haven for right - wing extremists and even @entity1 neo-nazis			2
such charges stem back partly to the legacy of @entity1 's nationalist , partisan forces before and during @entity217 while it is true that @entity1 nationalists sought the help of @entity221 to drive the @entity137 out of @entity1 territory , some later fell afoul of the @entity223 and ended up in @entity225 concentration camps			1
these days , @entity149 spends a lot of his time trying to dispel such fears			0
he has even appointed a @entity229 as one of his most trusted media and communications advisers			0
" @entity34 is a nationalistic organization			0
but @entity1 nationalism has nothing to do with the @entity225 nazis or the @entity237 fascists , " @entity149 said			2
" we have always been and will always be against xenophobia , anti-semitism and for @entity1 to have an independent nation where the rights of all the minorities will be guaranteed , " he explained			0
it 's hard to argue with @entity149 as you meet the stare of his ice - green eyes			0
but it 's also easy to worry about @entity34 's true ideological leanings when you see the red - and - black flags , stylized insignia and other paraphernalia of its militiamen			0
as an afternoon drizzle came down on @entity23 's funeral , tears snaked along the wrinkles of his father @entity259 's face			2
his mother @entity261 lowered a loaf of wholemeal bread into the grave -- a local tradition to ensure her son would not go hungry in the afterlife			0
and dozens of men who once marched to @entity23 's command now filed past his grave , tossing handfuls of damp earth onto his coffin			2
in unison they vowed -- no surrender to the @entity99			0
@entity278 : @entity131 and @entity279 united over @entity1 crisis @entity131 intel : @entity99 likely to enter eastern @entity1			1
