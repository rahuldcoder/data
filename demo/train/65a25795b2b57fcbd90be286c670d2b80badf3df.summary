@entity0 -- @entity3 may wholeheartedly believe that hardcourts are " too tough " on players ' bodies , but there is currently no proof to back up his claims , a leading sports scientist has told @entity1			1
" the evidence is n't there , which is surprising considering ( how long serious sport has been played )			0
but the proper randomized controlled trials simply have n't been done , " says @entity13 from the @entity14 at the @entity16 's @entity15			0
" most of the evidence is anecdotal -- by that i mean identifying trends of injuries which can be related to surfaces or equipment is difficult to disentangle from individual anecdotes that athletes or others make , " he added			0
@entity3 , who has struggled with knee problems during his career , criticized the @entity28 saying they " worry too little about players ' health " adding that officials should consider reducing the number of tournaments played on hard surfaces in a bid to prolong sports activity on and off court			1
" after ending the career , it would be nice to be able to play football with friends , or tennis ... " the 11 - time grand slam champion said , speaking at the @entity39 in @entity40 on tuesday			1
his second tournament this year following a seven - month absence due to an injury to his left knee			1
read : knee injury continues to ' bother ' @entity3 " the @entity28 should start thinking about ways to lengthen players ' careers			1
i ca n't imagine footballers playing on cement , i ca n't imagine any other sport involving aggressive movements such as tennis being played on such aggressive surfaces such as ours			0
we are the only sport in the world making this mistake and it wo n't change , " added @entity3 , who as youngster learnt the game playing on claycourts			2
but @entity13 , a professor of the physiology of exercise , says there are many factors in play when it comes to assessing player health			0
" as standards of performance increase so the demands also increase			0
there have been suggestions that this foreshortens people 's careers , but alternatively -- and tennis is a good example -- you have @entity90 players continuing to play major competitions well into their 30s , 40s and 50s , " @entity13 said			0
read : unbeaten in 10 years , wheelchair tennis ace retires " identifying trends is still very difficult , but i know of no convincing evidence to suggest that there is an increasing problem that more players are now becoming more seriously injured			1
" @entity13 is n't without sympathy for the 26 - year - old , who he says has suffered a lot during a seven - month layoff from the game , but a knee jerk - type reaction by the tennis authorities is unwarranted			1
" to what extent is this an expression of disappointment and to what extent is this an expression of a general trend ? " added @entity13			2
" for what it 's worth , my money is on the former more than the latter			0
it is heartfelt and sincere expression of disappointment which one should sympathise with , but it is not an accurate comment on a general trend			2
" the @entity28 declined to comment on the matter .			2

@entity3 says @entity28 " worries too little about the players "
@entity128 , who has *returned* to action after 7 - month layoff , says hardcourt action should be reduced
" no convincing evidence ... that more players are becoming seriously injured , says sports scientist
winter has sympathy for @entity3 but believes comments are more an expression of disappointment
