@entity0 -- mayor @entity2 , known in @entity0 for his tough regulations on everything from large sodas to smoking in @entity6 , proposed a new target during his final @entity9 speech thursday : plastic foam containers			1
" @entity11 increases the cost of recycling by as much as $ 20 per ton because it has to be removed , " the mayor said			0
" something we know is environmentally destructive , that is costing taxpayers money , and that is easily replaceable , i think , is something we can do without			0
" specifically , the ban will target certain polystyrene foam products , not necessarily @entity11 , a trademarked product of @entity21 used in foam insulation and construction products			1
" with speaker ( @entity25 ) @entity24 and the @entity26 , we 'll work to adopt a law banning @entity11 food packaging from our stores and restaurants , " @entity2 added			1
" and do n't worry , the doggy bag and the coffee cup will survive just fine			1
" it was not immediately clear how the majority of businesses that use polystyrene foam products would react to a ban			2
one early response from the @entity40 chain was not positive			0
instead of an outright ban , it said in a written statement , the company has " reviewed or tested nearly every type of single - use hot cup on the market , but a viable alternative does not yet exist			2
this is a process , and we will continue to test and try new things until we find a cup that keeps drinks hot , hands cool and is better for the planet			0
" a polystyrene ban will not eliminate waste or increase recycling ; it will simply replace one type of trash with another , " it said			0
until a solution is found , @entity40 has cut the weight of its foam and plastic cups and " offered our franchisees a reusable mug program			2
" plastic foam product limitations have already been ordered in several other cities , including @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71 , @entity72			1
throughout his tenure , @entity73 has garnered a reputation for bold and sometimes controversial initiatives			1
despite public outcry , he pushed to regulate trans fat in food preparation in 2007 , signed into law a ban on smoking in most public spaces in 2011 , and last march prohibited sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in certain venues			0
the mayor has also advocated for , and sometimes financially supported , same - sex marriage , gun control , and several new public health proposals			0
" now we are working on obesity and hopefully the courts wo n't stop us , " @entity2 said of his health policy efforts during a january press conference			1
" these small public health things that we do really make a difference in people 's lives			0

mayor @entity2 wants to ban the use of plastic foam containers
mayor : " do n't worry , the doggy bag and the coffee cup will survive just fine "
it is one of many health or environmental initiatives @entity73 has *pursued*
