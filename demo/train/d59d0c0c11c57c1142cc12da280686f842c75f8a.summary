-- during the last four months , the people of @entity2 have been fighting for their freedom , independence and @entity6 path in a war started by @entity9 - backed terrorists and their accomplices			1
@entity2 military forces suffer heavy losses in battles against terrorists equipped with the newest @entity9 weaponry			1
we 've seen reports of the @entity19 thugs shooting women and children , cynically calling it a " protection of the @entity9 - speaking population			2
" the price we are paying to bring peace back to the regions of @entity28 and @entity29 in eastern @entity2 is too high			1
@entity2 president @entity30 has proposed the decentralization of power as part of his peace plan			1
it means more freedom , more economic autonomy and more opportunities to use languages spoken in a particular community for every region			2
how rebels in @entity2 built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies @entity2 has also demonstrated its genuine willingness to resolve this crisis through negotiations and compromises			1
our armed forces have shown exceptional restraint during their military operations in order to avoid casualties among peaceful civilians and prevent destruction of their towns and villages			0
our unilateral cease - fire in the zone of the conflict had lasted from june 20 to june 30 , during which 27 @entity2 servicemen , from all over @entity2 , were killed by the bandits			1
on july 17 we believe the terrorists fired at the @entity65 @entity64 , cutting short the lives of almost 300 people			0
this was a tragic wake - up call to the whole world			0
from now on @entity9 exporters of terrorism bring tragedy and tears to people across the planet -- from the @entity77 to @entity78			0
@entity2 , knowing too well the bitterness of loss , sincerely share grief with the families of the deceased			1
our government is conducting , together with a team of international experts , a thorough investigation of the circumstances of this heinous act of terrorism			0
there is already incontrovertible evidence that the airliner was shot down by an anti-aircraft missile system that had arrived from @entity9			0
when civilian planes are shot down for the first time since 1983 , when a @entity98 jet fighter deliberately shot down a @entity100 @entity99 , @entity9 stands entangled in such a horrendous tragedy			0
we remember that an objective investigation of that catastrophe was made possible only 10 years later , after the @entity98 collapsed			0
we would not like to have to wait that long to learn the truth about the tragedy of @entity106			1
indeed , the guilty must be promptly punished			1
we are encouraged with the growing understanding in both the @entity109 and the @entity110 of the nature of terrorism in eastern @entity2			1
while @entity114 senators and @entity116 ministers already consider designating the @entity117 and its @entity29 twin as terrorist organizations , we expect @entity9 to halt its support to terrorists			0
since most of them are @entity9 citizens and " former " security service officers , we also urge @entity125 to take them away from @entity2			2
@entity9 sponsorship of terrorism in @entity2 amply demonstrates that in the 21st century any regional conflict invariably poses a threat to global security			2
@entity133 and internal terrorism , as well as unbridled export of conventional and high - tech weaponry , have no regard for state borders , national sovereignty or human lives			2
@entity2 has been consistently advocating not only international control of nuclear weapons , but today we also stand for the creation of a universal mechanism for international control of conventional arms			2
we strive for a world based on the respect for international law and trust between nations			0
join us on @entity153 / @entity152 .			0

@entity155 : with downing of @entity106 , price of peace in eastern @entity2 already too high
@entity155 : @entity2 know bitterness of loss , share grief with families of the deceased
he says the guilty must be promptly punished
