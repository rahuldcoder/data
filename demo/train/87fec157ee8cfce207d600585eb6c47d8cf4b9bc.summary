@entity0 , @entity1 -- one month ago , the @entity5 copper and gold mine in @entity1 caved in , trapping 33 miners far underground			1
for the next 17 days , their families had no idea whether they were alive or dead			1
here in their words , some of the wives , fathers and daughters think back to the first moments after learning of the accident and their efforts to keep hope alive			1
@entity24 , wife of @entity25 : " i felt a lot of rage and pain and i felt powerless			1
i knew this was an accident waiting to happen			1
" @entity25 asked the bosses to take measures so the miners did n't run the risk of getting buried			1
a lot of the miners said they had heard the mountain groaning			1
one said he did n't want to go down the mine that day , he was afraid			1
but the boss said to him either you go down or i have five other people who will go down			0
" i never doubted that i had a lot of faith they were all alive and that they were all together and that 's how they found them			1
all together ! " @entity46 , partner of @entity47 : " those first days were unforgettable it was huge uncertainty , just waiting and waiting			0
" those were very bitter moments			0
i was crying day and night			0
i did n't want to sleep			1
i did n't want to go home , because my loved one was n't with me , and when i ate i got angry with myself because i thought of him going hungry			1
" i held out hope @entity53 had been outside the mine			0
when i was crying i hoped he was going to come out and hug me and say , ' @entity56 , i 'm here			0
' but the hours went by and they reported the names of the missing miners and @entity53 never came			1
" @entity63 , daughter of @entity64 : " i felt rage and pain and frustration			1
i thought how can they be trapped like that			2
but here in @entity1 they 've always treated our miners like animals			1
i miss him so much			0
my dad always cheered us up and made us laugh			0
i just feel so so bad			0
" i was sad and disillusioned			0
i did n't want to hear anything more about the accident			1
it 's not exactly that i lost hope			2
it 's just i did n't want to get my hopes up too high			1
" @entity83 , father of @entity84 : " i was stunned by the news but i did n't cry			2
i 'm not the kind to cry			0
but my wife began to cry and i tried to calm her down and said take it easy ; we do n't know anything for sure just yet			1
" i always had faith and i stayed calm			0
and then what happened happened			0
and then the miracle came			0
" @entity94 , wife of @entity84 : " i was cooking his evening meal and waiting for him to come home			2
... when i heard about the accident my world just collapsed			2
i could n't even sleep for five days straight			2
but i had to try and be strong especially for my two sons			0
" @entity101 , wife of @entity102 : " at the time it did n't sink in that the accident had been so big			1
... i cried a lot but i was trying to keep my spirits up because of the children			0
i kept phoning his cell phone and it just rang and rang and kept going to voice mail			0
" @entity112 , father of @entity102 : " i 'm not the kind of person to sit there with my arms crossed and crying			0
i said my son needs my help and i 'm going after him			0
" i went into the mine with five others to try and find them			0
it was terrible , terrible			0
i looked up and the roof was opening			0
rocks were falling down and i was looking for a way to make it through the shower of rocks			0
so i left @entity128 , the man , at the door , and @entity128 , the miner went inside			2
a miner must be brave			2
it 's like the boxer when he steps into the ring			2
he must leave his fear outside			2
" @entity136 , wife of @entity137 : " a friend phoned and said the @entity140 [ @entity5 ] mine has just collapsed and the miners are trapped inside			1
i said , ' what ? that ca n't be true ! ' and i began crying			1
i was crying and i could n't talk i was just crying and crying			2
... i said my @entity137 ca n't leave me like this			1
@entity137 has to be alive			1
