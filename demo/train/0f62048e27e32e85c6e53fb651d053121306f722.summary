@entity0 -- the @entity2 on thursday accused veteran rep. @entity3 of 13 violations of @entity2 rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of @entity8			1
the charges accused the 20 - term @entity10 from @entity11 of using his influence to solicit donations for a college policy center in his name from corporate heads and others with business before the powerful @entity20 that @entity3 chaired until forced to give up the leadership position earlier this year			1
other charges involve alleged income tax and financial disclosure violations , as well as improper use of government mail service and letterhead			1
" @entity28 is what 's at stake here ; the very credibility of the @entity2 itself before the @entity41 people , " said rep. @entity32 , the ranking @entity33 on a subcommittee that will hold a trial - like hearing on the charges against @entity3			1
@entity32 spoke at the subcommittee 's first meeting , described as an organizational session			0
@entity3 was not required to attend and did not show up to hear the first public disclosure of the formal charges against him			1
asked later about his response to the charges , @entity3 sounded contrite in saying he may have been " overzealous " in serving the public but took some comfort that the allegations involved no " corruption " or " self - dealing			1
" " i ca n't make an excuse for serious violations , but i can have an explanation of my intent , " he said			0
" and to large degree that 's what my life has been all about -- intent			0
" @entity3 said it was " a very , very rough period for me and my family , but we all , including my community , will get by this			2
" in the days leading up to the hearing , @entity3 had said he welcomed the completion of a two - year investigation by the ethics committee so that he could finally respond to specific accusations against him			1
according to documents released by the committee , @entity3 first learned of the charges being pursued by an investigating subcommittee on june 17			2
he filed a motion to have the charges dismissed , which the investigating panel denied , the documents showed			0
in a document dated wednesday , @entity3 's lawyers challenged the scope of the charges against him , saying @entity3 " did not abuse his official position or enrich himself financially			2
" " he did not target for solicitation foundations , corporations or individuals with business before the @entity91 , nor did he offer or provide preferential treatment or favors to potential contributors , " the document said			0
" he received no prohibited benefit , direct or indirect , from his work on behalf of this program that violates the ethics rules			0
" however , the document said @entity3 " recognizes that the public would have been better served if he had consulted the @entity102 staff in advance " of soliciting funding for the college center			1
@entity3 said this week that his lawyers were in talks with committee lawyers on a possible deal to settle the case without a hearing			2
when thursday 's hearing was delayed for 55 minutes with no explanation , rumors of an imminent agreement quickly spread			0
@entity116 : sound off on this story however , the panel gathered and held the hearing , and it remained unclear whether a settlement avoiding the spectacle of a trial hearing was possible			0
according to the charges , @entity3 allegedly failed to report more than $ 600,000 on financial disclosure reports and improperly used a rent - subsidized apartment as a campaign office for over a decade and failed to pay taxes on a home in the @entity129			1
@entity3 " argues that errors on his personal taxes do not implicate discharge of his official responsibilities , " committee investigators concluded in response to @entity3 's request to have the charges dismissed			1
he " appears to be operating under the erroneous belief that the only conduct subject to discipline is conduct directly related to the discharge of his official responsibilities			0
" an investigative subcommittee report on @entity3 's dealings , available on the committee 's website , detailed a lengthy series of meetings the congressman held with business leaders to raise funds for the @entity154 at the @entity155			2
his repeated attempts to woo potential donors violated the @entity2 's solicitation and gift ban , the report said			2
among other things , the report stated that @entity3 met with a lobbyist for insurance giant @entity164 in april 2008 with the objective to " close " a $ 10 million " gift for the @entity167			2
" at the meeting , " @entity164 raised concerns about a potential donation , including the potential headline risk , " the report stated			0
but @entity3 pushed ahead , asking " @entity164 , at least twice , what was necessary to get this done			0
" during the period of time that @entity3 was seeking donations from @entity164 , according to committee investigators , the company was lobbying the @entity2 on several tax and trade issues -- matters over which @entity3 exercised considerable influence			1
it also noted that , in march 2007 , he used congressional letterhead to send notes to business leaders such as @entity186 , in which he requested meetings to discuss the @entity167			0
the congressman 's " acceptance of favors and benefits from donors to the @entity167 ... might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties , " the report concluded , adding that the " accumulation of ( @entity3 's ) actions reflected poorly on the institution of the @entity2 and , thereby , brought discredit to the @entity2			1
" in the july 28 response , @entity3 's lawyers argued that some of the cited infractions were unintended in his effort to help the college			1
" if he mistakenly used the wrong letterhead or other modest resources in this worthy cause , the error was made in good faith , " the document said			0
" it is undisputed that every single charitable contribution in this case went to @entity155 , a public educational institution , and not to the congressman , " it said , later adding that " the uncontroverted evidence is that congressman @entity3 never suggested that any donor to the @entity220 would receive favorable consideration in legislative matters and never gave preferential treatment to any contributor			2
" @entity32 said the allegations against @entity3 , if proven , would violate " the most fundamental code of conduct " for @entity2 members			1
rep. @entity230 of @entity231 , a @entity10 who led a two - year ethics subcommittee investigation of @entity3 , said it was a difficult job			2
" the task is even more difficult when the subject has befriended and mentored so many new members , and i 'm one of them , " @entity230 said			0
another ethics committee member , @entity33 rep. @entity33 of @entity239 , said " this is truly a sad day where no one , regardless of their partisan stripes , should rejoice			0
" @entity3 temporarily stepped down as @entity20 chairman earlier this year following the announcement of an ethics investigation of several allegations , including failure to pay taxes on the @entity129 residence			0
the @entity2 previously admonished @entity3 for violating rules on receiving gifts			1
specifically , the committee found that @entity3 violated @entity2 gift rules by accepting reimbursement payments for travel to conferences in the @entity259 in 2007 and 2008			1
@entity3 , whose autobiography that discusses his @entity262 experience is titled " and i have n't had a bad day since , " told reporters earlier thursday that " i have to reassess that ( statement ) " in light of the pending hearing			2
house speaker @entity268 said thursday -- in response to a question about @entity3 -- that there must be " accountability " and " transparency " in cases of ethical transgressions			1
" holding a high ethical standard is a serious responsibility ... and a top priority " for the @entity2 @entity280 leadership , she said			0
in terms of political fallout from cases such as @entity3 's , " the chips will fall where they may , " she said			0
congressional democrats have reportedly expressed concern that an extended public airing of the charges against @entity3 could damage the party 's prospects in the november midterm elections			1
@entity1 's @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity297 contributed to this report .			0
