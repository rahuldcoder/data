@entity0 -- after four nights of violence , an eerie calm descended wednesday and continued into thursday in @entity5 , where a massive police presence backed by strong words from the prime minister and vigilante efforts appeared to be having their intended effect			1
" a fightback is under way , " prime minister @entity12 said wednesday after meeting with his crisis - response committee			0
@entity12 said police have been authorized to use whatever means necessary to combat " despicable violence , " with plastic bullets permitted and plans in place for water cannon to be available if needed			1

it was " all too clear we have a big problem with gangs , " he said , adding that authorities would not " let any phony concerns about human rights " prevent police from trying to identify suspects			1
for a second consecutive night , 16,000 police blanketed @entity0 's streets wednesday into thursday			1
some residents were n't depending on them : in @entity0 , young @entity45 stood guard outside their temple			1
@entity50 of the city , in @entity49 , local residents chased after suspected looters			0
riot police faced off not with looters but with local residents whose anger verged on mob violence			1
such efforts were not always appreciated by police			1
" my officers need to focus on rioters and looters , not those vigilantes , " said @entity59 , deputy assistant for the @entity60			0
" the ones that help us are the community representatives who go and speak to people from their community and get them away and get them home , not people who threaten violence on anyone coming into their community			1
" police said residents could help them by identifying photographs of looting suspects on @entity79 pages like catchalooter			2
in @entity82 , police were treating a hit - and - run incident in which three men died as a murder inquiry			2
the men -- @entity5 @entity87 -- were returning at 1 a.m. wednesday from prayers to a gas station they were protecting when they were hit by the car			0
they have been identified as @entity91 , 31 ; his brother @entity92 , 30 ; and @entity93 , 20			0
one man has been arrested , and a vehicle was recovered , police said			1
though police had not announced any link between the rioting and the incident , it heightened already high tensions in the area			2
afterward , about 1,000 police flooded the neighborhood , where the father of one of the dead men tried to calm area residents			1
" i lost my son , " @entity110 said			0
" blacks , @entity114 , whites			0
we all live in the same community			0
why do we have to kill one another ? what started these riots , and what 's escalated them ? why are we doing this ? i lost my son			2
step forward if you want to lose your sons			0
otherwise , calm down and go home			0
please ! " also wednesday , police identified a 26 - year - old man who had been discovered shot in the head monday night in a vehicle in the south @entity0 town of @entity132 as @entity133			1
he was taken to a hospital , where he died tuesday			0
initial inquiries indicate he had traveled earlier monday with friends to the @entity132 area , where they became involved in a dispute with a group of some nine other people , police said			1
the dispute led to a pursuit involving three vehicles , after which @entity133 was shot , said police , who appealed to any witnesses to come forward			2
two men were arrested at the scene on suspicion of handling stolen goods and were released on bail , a police statement said			1
some people were using social media to get the city back on its feet			1
@ @entity157 was organizing neighbors and giving them brooms in the hope that community solidarity would keep the violence at bay			2

more than 100 police officers have been injured			2

assistant chief constable @entity197 said he was appalled by the rioters ' " shameful actions " in @entity196 and @entity195			1
" these people have nothing to protest against -- there is no sense of injustice or any spark that has led to this			2
it is , pure and simple , acts of criminal behavior which are the worst i have seen on this scale , " he said			0
the violence comes against a backdrop of austerity measures and budget cuts			2
but @entity12 , community leaders and police have repeatedly pointed to a criminal , rather than political , motivation for the looting			0
the violence began saturday after a protest over the august 4 shooting death of a man in an incident involving police in north @entity0			1
officers from @entity228 -- a @entity60 unit that deals with gun crime in the black community -- stopped a cab carrying 29 - year - old @entity232 , a black man , in the working - class , predominantly @entity236 district of @entity237 during an attempted arrest , the @entity226 ( @entity226 ) said			0
soon after , shots were fired and @entity240 , a father of four , was killed			0

on subsequent nights , the violence spread to other areas of @entity5			0
police characterized the disorder as " copycat criminal activity " by people intent on looting and destruction			1
analysts say a mix of economic and social tensions has been at play in the unrest , with deprivation a key factor			0
