-- " a calculated , cold - blooded predator			2
" that was how @entity4 judge @entity3 described a then 22 - year - old @entity5 on december 20 , 2002 , when the defendant was sentenced after being convicted on 12 counts of burglary			1
today , @entity9 -- now 31 -- sits in a @entity4 courtroom , where a jury will weigh his guilt on murder charges , and potentially pave the way for a death sentence			1
prosecutors say that on july 23 , 2007 , @entity9 and an accomplice , @entity5 , invaded the home of dr. @entity5 , raped and strangled his wife , @entity5 , molested one of their daughters , and set the house on fire before attempting to flee			1
@entity24 and her daughters -- 17 - year - old @entity5 and 11 - year - old @entity5 -- died in the invasion of their @entity28 , @entity4 , home			1
dr. @entity5 , although severely beaten , managed to escape and crawl to a neighbor 's residence			1
@entity5 was sentenced to death in december , after being convicted of 16 out of the 17 charges related to the three deaths			1
both suspects had lengthy criminal records when they were arrested for the @entity24 invasion			2
@entity9 's long rap sheet , in particular , suggest that he was a troubled young man with a penchant for nighttime burglary and crystal meth			1
officials with the @entity42 and @entity43 declined to speak with @entity0 , citing a gag order in the case			2
but over 200 pages of @entity9 's parole records have been released , which -- along with previous court testimony -- help paint a picture of the accused			1
one of his former attorneys , @entity54 , said that @entity9 came from a close , religious family			2
but at the age of 14 , he began using drugs -- the same year , he claims , that he found out that he was adopted			2
by 18 , @entity9 had found his drugs of choice : crystal meth and cocaine			2
he told the parole board that he stole money and electronics from upscale homes to feed his drug habit			1
yet a transcript from his 2002 sentencing paints @entity9 as more than just the average thief			1
according to a police statement read aloud in court that day , @entity9 admitted that he broke into his first house when he was 14 years old			1
" i always wore gloves , with the exception of one incident when i was 14			2
approximately a year and a half ago , i acquired night vision goggles ... i used the night - vision equipment during the burglaries ( over ) the past year , " he said , according to the transcript			0
@entity54 , who was @entity9 's defense attorney at the time , stressed that a need for money , to pay for drugs , drove his client			0
but he admitted that the way he went about it was unusual			0
" ninety - nine percent of burglaries are ( committed by ) junkies -- there 's nothing romantic about what they do , " said @entity54			0
" that was the first time i 'd seen something as exotic as that			0
" @entity9 confessed that he only broke into homes at night and never during the day -- a point stressed by prosecutors in the 2002 trial			1
they said his affinity for breaking into people 's homes at night showed that he wanted a confrontation , since that was the time when the residents were the most likely to be at home			0
speaking during his december 2002 sentencing , @entity9 appeared repentant			1
he addressed the court saying , " i 've turned my back on my faith in @entity112 and my family			0
and in doing so , i fell flat on my face and deep into hard drugs ... the crimes i committed was weighing so heavily on my shoulders			0
" but the judge was not moved by @entity9 's show of remorse , sentencing him to nine years in prison plus six years of special parole , which has greater restrictions than typical probation			1
in april 2007 , he was paroled			0
and three months later , @entity9 was arrested for the @entity24 home invasion and murders			0
what happened then , and what may have driven @entity9 , remains a mystery to @entity54 , his former attorney			0
" he was a very complex young man			0
i do n't think i 've met anyone quite that complex , and i sensed there was an abundance of issues that had to be dealt with , " @entity54 said			0
" i wish him well , and i hope the jury makes the right decision			0

@entity5 was convicted in 2002 on 12 counts of burglary
five years later , after being released on parole , he was accused of murder
prosecutors say he **killed** a @entity4 woman and set a fire that **killed** her daughters
