he had been guarding the @entity1 in @entity2 , as he 'd done many other days -- with commitment and professionalism			1
she had gone there to have tea with the ambassador , a respected television journalist set to renew acquaintances with a diplomat and do her job			1
whether or not they 'd crossed paths before , these two people 's stories now forever will be intertwined -- thanks to a man @entity19 authorities say belonged to the @entity21 organization known as the @entity23 's @entity22 , or @entity24 , which the @entity26 government and others label a terrorist organization			1
what is the @entity24 ? @entity30 , as he was identified by @entity32 police , died after detonating his bomb near the embassy 's @entity34 around 1:15 p.m. ( 6:15 a.m. et ) friday			0
so , too , did the @entity19 guard -- described by @entity26 ambassador @entity37 as a " hero , " and identified by @entity19 's semi-official @entity39 as @entity40			1
a photo showed the journalist being carried away on a stretcher , apparently bleeding			2
rather than sitting with her for tea , @entity37 visited the woman -- @entity47 -- at @entity2 's @entity48 , and afterward described her as " one of the best			1
" while theories have been floated , neither @entity19 nor @entity26 authorities have detailed why they think @entity30 blew himself up			1
prior to friday , he was known to @entity26 and other intelligence agencies , a @entity26 law enforcement source told @entity54			1
whatever @entity57 's rationale , the explosion spurred security clampdowns at diplomatic facilities in @entity19 , plus messages of condolences and solidarity			0
@entity19 prime minster @entity63 called it an attack " against the peace and welfare of our country			0
" yet the violence reverberated well beyond @entity19 's borders , however , especially in the nation whose embassy was targeted			0
the spotlight on @entity26 diplomatic installations was already intense after violence last september in @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , where ambassador @entity81 was one of four @entity26 killed in @entity82			1
@entity26 rep. @entity83 said friday 's explosion in @entity19 served as " yet another stark reminder of the constant terrorist threat against @entity26 facilities , personnel and interests aboard			1
" " coming after @entity82 , it underscores the need for a comprehensive review of security at our diplomatic posts , " said @entity83 , a @entity91 @entity90 and chairman of @entity93			0
' he exploded at the guard ' the bomber had first gone to the rear access of the embassy , then went to a checkpoint on the building 's perimeter where ids are checked , explained @entity109 spokeswoman @entity108			1
according to law enforcement sources working on the investigation , @entity30 blew himself up on a walkway for embassy employees and their guests			0
" he exploded at the guard , " @entity108 explained			2
the guard , @entity40 , on one side of the security barrier was killed			1
two guards on the other side of the glass survived , said the @entity109 spokeswoman			0
the blast blew a hole in what appeared to be a building that is part of the compound 's outer gate , images from @entity54 sister network @entity124 showed			1
this was all part of a large complex that includes blast doors , reinforced windows and a series of metal detectors that visitors must navigate before reaching embassy offices			2
are you there ? send us your photos and videos , but please stay safe the attack stirred swift condemnations , as well as fresh security precautions			0
the @entity26 @entity1 in @entity2 subsequently put out a statement telling @entity26 not to visit that facility or @entity26 consulates in @entity32 or @entity151 " until further notice			1
" portions of @entity154 , where the targeted embassy is located , were shut down , according to @entity39 news			0
@entity157 and @entity158 , meanwhile , were among the countries who tightened their security in the wake of the blast			2
the @entity26 ambassador said in a statement that he 'd " paid my respects to the family of the @entity19 hero who stood guard for us every day			1
" calling him " well trained ( and ) committed to his job , " @entity37 praised the late guard as a " good , excellent , professional guard " who " died defending the @entity19 and the @entity26 who work at the embassy			1
" the ambassador also talked about visiting @entity179 , whom he recalled was " the first person to interview me when i arrived two years ago at @entity182			2
" having learned she 'd recently left the @entity19 network , @entity37 said he invited her to tea			2
" she serves her country by getting the truth to the @entity19 people , " the ambassador said			2
" she , i think , is one of the best			0
" not first brush with terror for @entity19 , @entity26 friday 's blast was hardly @entity19 's first brush with terror			1
at the nexus of @entity197 and @entity198 , and with deep roots in the @entity201 and @entity202 spheres , @entity19 has long been a boiling pot -- and , occasionally , a target			0
in recent years , it has been site of many acts of political violence from groups such as leftist anarchists , @entity211 separatists , @entity212 and @entity213			2
@entity214 , a security expert at the @entity215 in @entity2 , said friday 's attack could be related to recent arrests of @entity24 members			2
since the beginning of january , 85 members of the group have been taken into custody , he said , adding that @entity19 police have been closely focusing on the group over the past five years			0
the @entity24 was established in the 1970s			0
@entity214 said that one plausible theory is the group is trying to send a message to @entity19 authorities by attacking the @entity26 embassy because it is near the @entity19 parliament building			1
@entity24 has a track record as a " subcontractor " group for other militant outfits , and it is also believed to have relationships with states in the region such as @entity237 and @entity238 , @entity214 said			0
the group has a relationship with the @entity240 , the @entity240 , which has been at odds with @entity19 's government for some time			0
@entity214 said the attack could be linked to negotiations between the @entity240 and @entity19 government			0
another possibility is that @entity237 or @entity238 could be involved , considering the recent deployment of @entity249 missiles in @entity19 as a defense against possible missiles from @entity237			0
the explosion occurred as about 400 @entity26 military personnel are moving @entity249 missile defense equipment to a @entity19 base as part of an effort to defend the country from possible attack from @entity237			1
the first battery became operational last saturday in the city of @entity151 , @entity262 said , and more equipment arrived wednesday in the port city of @entity265			0
@entity63 , however , ruled out that friday 's attack had anything to do with @entity237 , according to an interview on the private @entity270 channel later reported by @entity271			0
of course , this may have to do primarily with the @entity26 itself -- independent of anything involving @entity19 or its government			2
while the @entity26 @entity1 in @entity2 has not seen this kind of incident in decades , in 2008 three police officers died in a shootout with assailants outside the @entity26 @entity281 in @entity32			1
three attackers died in the incident , which the @entity26 ambassador at the time called " an obvious act of terrorism			1
" one of the attackers in that incident was believed to have trained with @entity213 in @entity293 's @entity292 region			0
