-- there have been so many shrill , dumb , rinky - dink romantic comedies that it 's easy to feel downright grateful when a smart , non-cheesy one comes along			1
" admission , " a likable breezy campus movie directed by @entity6 ( " @entity7 " ) , is blissfully non-insulting			1
the film is set at @entity10 , and @entity12 's screenplay , which is based on @entity14 's novel , crackles with the sound of very clever people trying to out - talk each other — an all too rare and happy thing to encounter in a @entity20 movie			1
box office preview : ' the @entity22 ' will oust ' @entity23 ' from top spot @entity25 ( @entity26 ) is one of @entity10 's elite team of admissions officers			1
she has the job of helping to choose which of the college 's more than 26,000 yearly applicants , all of whom believe they deserve a place in the @entity10 pantheon , are going to get in			2
( approximate acceptance ratio : 1 in 26			2
) in this academic seller 's market , @entity25 holds the power			2
but so much is riding on her decisions that the pressure of sorting through all those high school seniors , with their hilariously overstuffed extracurricular résumés ( and their even more obsessive parents ) , has strung her tight			0
@entity26 's sweet - and - sour line readings at first sound like @entity50 redux , and i was glad for the moment when her 10 - year relationship with a twit of an @entity56 professor ( @entity57 , who also played one of @entity50 's disastrous boyfriends on " @entity60 " ) crashes and burns			1
the breakup unhinges @entity26 's character , and liberates her performance			1
from that point on , she 's falling apart — or at least falling into a pit of desperation — and the neurotic crack - up looks good on her			0
it gives almost everything she does a shimmer of spontaneity			0
@entity74 ( @entity75 ) , a teacher at a woodsy alternative @entity77 high school called @entity78 , is @entity25 's opposite : a do - gooding globe - trotter who believes in the kind of excellence that ca n't always be measured by grades or '' official '' achievement			1
' admission ' star @entity87 applied early - decision for stardom he 's pushing one of his students for admission to @entity10 ; the kid , @entity93 ( @entity87 ) , is a prodigy with a troubled background , and @entity74 and @entity25 begin to tussle over his future from the moment they meet			0
@entity74 thinks that @entity93 may be @entity25 's son , and the battle , as far as it goes , is lively			0
but then , just about every character in " admission " has an enjoyably feisty intellectual attitude , from the wily dean of admissions ( @entity104 , for once not used as a walking punchline , and all the better for it ) , to @entity25 's switchblade - sharp office rival ( @entity108 ) , to the precocious students at @entity74 's school who question @entity25 about @entity10 being a '' corporation '' devoted to the status quo			0
that @entity25 answers their gripe every bit as tartly demonstrates that the movie holds its traditional - versus - free - thinking priorities in a nice yin - and - yang balance			2
" @entity102 " has a promising first half , and the movie springs a real wild card in @entity121 's brashly cutting and funny turn as @entity25 's mother , who wears her die - hard ' 70s feminism like a suit of burlap armor			1
her performance is an inspired satire of boomer self - righteousness and , at the same time , an unapologetic celebration of it			0
line by line , " @entity102 " is often fresh , yet it 's also one of those films that are so diagrammed that a soggy predictability begins to settle in			1
for a while , @entity26 and @entity75 spark each other , but the bantering flirtation loses heat			1
i think that 's because @entity25 , as written , has a genuine edge to her , whereas @entity75 , with his smiley sincerity , is stuck playing too nice and flawless a guy			1
@entity74 would have been a more logical romantic foil if he 'd had a pesky , holier - than - thou side			2
@entity150 confirmed for role in ' divergent ' even with this soft - boiled romance at its center , " admission " really is a movie about whether @entity93 , with his lowly grade - point average and astonishing @entity158 test scores , is going to get into @entity10			1
and here , i 'm afraid , the film 's values are a bit out of whack			0
it makes us pine for that ideal of @entity167 opportunity , a dream that it hangs on the issue of @entity93 's admission			0
but what if he did n't get in ? surely he could go to some other good college			0
( he would seem perfect for @entity174			0
) for a movie that 's out to tweak the control - freak nature of the college - application process , " admission , " in the end , bows down far too slavishly to it			2
it confuses achievement with acceptance			0
grade : b see the original story at @entity0			2
