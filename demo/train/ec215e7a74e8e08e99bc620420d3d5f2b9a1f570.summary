four years ago an unknown startup called @entity1 showed up at the @entity3 conference here with a prototype of its first desktop @entity5 printer , which spit out plastic replicas of small objects			1
@entity9 , the company 's co-founder , took the machine around to @entity13 's watering holes , set it on the bar and showed off its capabilities by printing shot glasses			1
" they were pretty popular , " he said			0
on friday , @entity9 was back at @entity3 , this time as a keynote speaker before a packed hall of 3,000 people , further evidence that 3 - d printing is a hot trend in the tech world			1
once again , he brought a new prototype with him			0
this time @entity1 unveiled a desktop device that can scan small three - dimensional objects			1
called a @entity29 , it 's meant to complement the company 's replicator printer by letting customers scan objects , then feed the resulting digital files to the replicator to be printed			1
the digitizer uses two lasers and a webcam to scan objects up to about 8 inches in diameter ( @entity9 brought a small plastic garden gnome as an example			1
) the process takes less than three minutes			0
once the digital scan is completed , an object can be printed right away			2
it 's easier and faster than using software to design a digital printing model from scratch			2
" this is something you would envision being science fiction , but in fact , it is real -- and it is so cool , " said @entity9 , who described the @entity29 as a great tool for archiving or replicating prototypes , models , parts , artifacts , sculptures and other objects " if something gets broken , you can just scan it and print it again			1
" he said the scanner will hit the market this fall			0
@entity9 did not say how much it would cost , although if the price is comparable to @entity1 's printers -- $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 -- it 'll be within reach of most small - business owners			1
the process of 3 - d printing uses computer - created digital models to create real - world objects -- everything from simple toys or jewelry to more complex objects with moving parts			2
the printers follow the shape of the model by stacking layer upon layer of molten plastic to produce the items			0
the emerging @entity5 printing industry got a boost last month when president @entity93 highlighted it in his @entity94 as something that could revive manufacturing and fuel new high - tech jobs in the @entity98			1
the @entity99 - based @entity1 has emerged as a pioneer in the burgeoning field by making home @entity5 printing relatively affordable			1
@entity9 , who was splashed on the cover of @entity103 last year , has become the industry 's poster boy			2
" i think we can safely say that if there is a @entity5 printing revolution , he is the commander in chief , " said @entity107 director @entity106 in introducing @entity9 , @entity1 's ceo , on friday			1
in his remarks , @entity9 said he has been excited to see the many ways people have used @entity5 printers to enhance their lives			1
he showed a slide of a boy in @entity119 , born without fingers on his right hand , who received a low - cost prosthetic made by a 3 - d printer			0
" there 's a renaissance going on ( in 3 - d printing ) now			0
it 's never been easier to make and share things , " he said			0
" you can fill the world with garden gnomes if you want			0
" somebody in the audience asked @entity9 if 3 - d printers will someday be able to print any object you could possibly need			2
" yes , eventually , " he said			0
" there are some limitations ( now ) , " he added , citing @entity1 's messy attempts to print food , such as chocolate			2
@entity1 's announcement of its digitizer scanner is an unusual occurrence at @entity107 , which is typically known for launching apps and social media tools , not hardware			0
but the small but growing company -- @entity9 said he 's looking to hire 50 people -- is already becoming a role model for other startups			2
" as an entrepreneur you have to believe that it 's possible ( to succeed ) , " he said in response to a question from an audience member			0
" one of the reasons @entity1 worked is that we did n't know how hard it was going to be			0

@entity1 on friday unveils a desktop device that can scan small @entity5 objects
the resulting digital file can then be used to print a @entity5 replica of the object
@entity1 ceo @entity9 : " there 's a renaissance going on ( in @entity5 printing ) now "
@entity9 was speaking friday at the @entity3 *festival*
