a @entity1 report on the september 11 , 2012 , attack that killed four @entity3 -- including ambassador @entity4 -- in @entity5 , @entity6 , calls into question much of what @entity8 accusing the @entity10 administration of a cover - up have said about the incident			1
the three main points of contention have been whether the attack was planned , whether it was sparked by an @entity18 video , and whether @entity19 was involved			1
however , the @entity1 says , the administration 's version , focusing on outrage over the inflammatory video , and first delivered by then - ambassador to the @entity26 @entity25 on sunday morning talk shows five days later , is n't exactly right , either			1
" the reality in @entity5 was different , and murkier , than either of those story lines suggests			2
@entity5 was not infiltrated by @entity19 , but nonetheless contained grave local threats to @entity3 interests			1
the attack does not appear to have been meticulously planned , but neither was it spontaneous or without warning signs , " according to @entity38 's article in the @entity1			1
it 's a conclusion that @entity40 has drawn in its previous reporting			0
the attack at the @entity5 diplomatic compound has become a political flashpoint in a long - running battle between the @entity46 and @entity8 , who accuse the @entity10 administration of not bolstering security before the attack , of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the november election			1
the @entity8 suggests the administration removed specific terror references and stuck to the explanation advanced by @entity58 -- later proved untrue -- that the attack was the result of spontaneous demonstrations over the @entity3 - produced film " @entity63 , " which contained scenes some @entity65 considered blasphemous			1
the @entity46 and its allies in @entity67 have said any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the assault stemmed from the " fog of war , " not any deliberate effort to mislead the public			0
the @entity46 had no comment when @entity40 requested a response to the @entity1 article			1
after reading it , @entity10 's former national security spokesman @entity77 unleashed a series of tweets , including these , condemning @entity8 who 've spent more than a year lambasting and investigating the @entity82 incident : -- " if rs spent 1/50th as much time as @ ddknyt learning what really happened in # @entity87 , we could have avoided months of disgusting demagoguery			1
" -- " republicans inflated the role of @entity19 in # @entity5 to attack @entity10 's ct record			1
they were wrong , and handed our enemy a propaganda win			0
" -- " credit to @ ddknyt but also disconcerting that his # @entity5 article offered more insight into what happened than all congressional hearings			2
" the @entity1 ' article , which includes interviews with several @entity6 militia leaders who helped bring down col. @entity104 's dictatorship in 2012 , says no evidence supports speculation about @entity19 's involvement in the @entity5 attack			1
to the contrary , the @entity1 reports that the diverse and fractured opposition militias , many of whom were at least somewhat friendly toward @entity3 interests , most likely contributed to the attack			1
that dovetails with the findings of the @entity118 investigative panel report on @entity5			2
" the @entity5 attacks also took place in a context in which the global terrorism threat as most often represented by @entity19 ( @entity19 ) is fragmenting and increasingly devolving to local affiliates and other actors who share many of @entity19 's aims , including violent anti-americanism , without necessarily being organized or operated under direct @entity19 command and control , " the report said			1
the @entity1 report zeroes in on militia leader @entity131 as well as the like - minded @entity133 militia @entity132			2
in a recent interview with @entity40 's @entity135 , @entity131 acknowledged being at the @entity5 mission after the attack but denied any involvement			2
@entity139 spent two hours interviewing @entity131 at a coffee shop at a well - known hotel in @entity5			2
he allowed @entity139 to use an audio recorder to tape the conversation , but refused to appear on camera			0
@entity131 's narrative of the events that night was sometimes unclear and , at times , seemed to be contradictory , @entity139 said			0
he admitted to being at the compound the night of the attack , but denied any involvement in the violence			2
asked about allegations he may have masterminded the attack , @entity131 and two of the men he brought with him to the interview " burst out laughing , " @entity139 said			0
@entity131 told @entity40 that he had not been questioned by either @entity6 authorities or the @entity159			0
the militia leader was one of those whom @entity3 prosecutors charged in the attacks , as @entity40 first reported			0
@entity132 is more a label than an organization , one that 's been adopted by conservative @entity168 groups across the @entity170 world			0
the name means , simply , " @entity172			0
" in @entity5 , @entity132 was one of many groups that filled the vacuum of authority following the overthrow of @entity104			0
the group 's central belief is that all authority is derived from the @entity181 , that democracy is un-islamic and that other branches of @entity184 , such as the @entity185 , are heretical			0
there do not appear to be organizational links between @entity132 and @entity19 , but there is solidarity			0
among the group 's @entity5 membership is @entity192 , who fought to overthrow @entity104 and praised @entity19 leader @entity193 in a @entity195 interview			1
he said @entity19 's statements " help galvanize the @entity65 nation , maintain its dignity and pride			0
" a different @entity132 is affiliated with @entity201 in @entity202 , and budding franchises are said to exist in @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 .			0

@entity1 article says competing *storylines* about 2012 @entity5 attack likely are both wrong
the report says contrary to @entity8 assertions , @entity19 was probably not involved in the attack
the article suggests independent @entity6 militias played a key role instead
report : *anti-muslim* video may have sparked the violence , but not solely , as suggested by @entity10 administration
