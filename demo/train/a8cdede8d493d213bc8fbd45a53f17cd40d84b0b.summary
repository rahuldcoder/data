" the clashes were sparked following a peaceful demonstration against the government 's proposal to uproot @entity4 and erect in its place a shopping mall styled like a 19th - century @entity41 barracks			2
but for many @entity0 now massing in the park and on @entity14 , a new mall is more than just another eyesore ; it is a symbol of autocratic rule from a government that , in their view , is harking back to bygone days when this city -- once considered a gateway to @entity52 -- was ruled by emperors			1

@entity100 , 19 , a university student studying @entity102 literature , believes the government 's latest policy initiatives and the " brutal " measures taken by police are a true reflection of the state of @entity0 democracy			1
" democracy is not just voting but protecting the voices of the minorities , " he says			0
" @entity1 is a historical city and many cultures existed here and we want to protect this history			0
" @entity1 -- a metropolis of 12 million people -- is famed as a melting pot of cultures where @entity120 and @entity122 heritage are fused into one city			0
while the protests rage on in @entity14 , much of the city remains peaceful			2
in the tourist hub of @entity129 , across the @entity127 , it 's business as usual			0

" he [ @entity61 ] is starting to define people as alcoholics if they drink , " she said in a reference to the recent enactment of stricter alcohol controls			1
" it 's just against freedom whatever your background			0
