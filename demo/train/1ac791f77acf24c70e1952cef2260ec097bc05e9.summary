-- " movies are n't an actor 's medium ... actors are just color in other people 's paintings , " @entity1 - winning actor @entity0 told @entity2 's @entity3			1
" i think there 's almost any actor whose been around for a while who can say this with absolute conviction that sometimes you go and see a movie that you 've made and you know you made a better movie than they cut			0
" he has n't turned his back on his profession , but the versatile performer who won two @entity1 for his roles in " @entity26 " and " @entity27 , " has happily embraced the other challenges that have come his way			2
from reviving the fortunes of the @entity31 in @entity32 to production credits on a number of films , acting has now become just one of @entity0 's numerous professional guises			1
his latest venture is appearing in a joint production in @entity40 called " inseparable " featuring @entity41 and @entity40 actress @entity42			0
" i think there 's no doubt that @entity40 is the next place for film -- there 's no doubt -- and that collaborations , this kind of exchange of a @entity52 actor coming to make a @entity40 film is a very exciting step , " he said			0
after his @entity40 experience he 'll be focusing on film until 2012 when he will then lead @entity57 , a transatlantic theatrical production company comprised of the @entity31 in @entity32 and @entity58 in @entity59			1
the company will be bringing " @entity63 " to @entity61 and @entity62 in march and april			0
longer term plans could see @entity0 return to the stage , but as a singer			2
his 2005 biopic " @entity69 " on 1950s crooner @entity68 was a labor of love where @entity0 was able to perform the songs of one of his heroes			2
to promote the movie he even toured with a 20 - piece big band across the @entity77 " i think it 's great that actually @entity79 wants to be able to bring back the headliner , and i think the nightclub act is one of the greatest things ever			1
" but that to me would be to me kind of fun to do again at some point , because i love singing and i do n't get a chance to sing as much as i 'd like , so we 'll see what happens			0

@entity0 is an @entity1 - winning actor and *artistic* *director* of the @entity31 in @entity32
he will lead @entity57 theatrical *co-production* in 2012
@entity0 would love to revive the headline nightclub act in @entity79
