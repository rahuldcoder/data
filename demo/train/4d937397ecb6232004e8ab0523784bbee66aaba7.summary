@entity0 -- a long - lost picture of @entity4 's @entity3 reveals the monarch 's portrait was " edited " after his abdication to show his replacement , @entity9			1
@entity3 posed for popular periodical " the @entity10 " in 1936 , ahead of his planned coronation			1
but when the monarch stepped down before he was officially crowned , artist @entity12 recycled the image , painting over @entity3 's face in an early version of the " airbrushing " familiar to today 's magazine readers			2
" we tend to think of it as a modern thing , but this just shows it has been going on forever , " said @entity10 chief executive @entity19			0
" i suppose the thinking was that the original would never be seen , so no one would ever know , " she told @entity1 , adding , " editors have always had to be resourceful -- news changes , and they have to change with it			0
" we found a note of how much the artists were paid for the portraits -- hundreds of pounds , which was a lot of money at the time -- and the magazine would not have wanted to waste that			0
" the alteration came to light following the discovery of a proof copy of a special coronation edition of the magazine			0
when images of the coronation that never happened were published in @entity4 newspapers , one eagle - eyed reader noticed the striking similarity between the unknown painting of @entity3 , and the image of @entity9 , which was published in a later issue of the periodical			1
@entity55 said the portrait was not the only item from the unpublished @entity3 coronation special to be recycled			2
" they were able to reuse some of the more general articles for the @entity9 coronation issue , and some other pictures of the coronation robes were also ' edited ' to show @entity9 -- again , the artist just changed the heads			1
" days after the abdication was announced , the magazine put out a special ' abdication and accession ' edition , and they ran a whole essay which had been due to run in the coronation issue as a tribute to @entity3 , and which became , in effect , a eulogy			1
" it is thought the magazine 's editor sir @entity77 was tipped off days before the abdication that the coronation issue might not be needed			2
in a page of notes attached to the proof copy and dated december 3 , 1936 -- a week before the official announcement -- he has written a list of alterations and revisions needed " if @entity88 abdicates			0
" " it is a sign of a smart editor , thinking on his feet and making the most of what they had , " @entity55 told @entity1			0
@entity3 became @entity3 on the death of his father , @entity96 , in january 1936 but reigned for less than a year before stepping aside on december 11 to marry @entity98 divorcee @entity97			1
his younger brother , @entity9 , who had never expected to become @entity3 , was named as his successor			2
the story of the new monarch 's struggle against a debilitating stutter in the early days of his reign was chronicled in the @entity107 - winning movie " @entity108			0
