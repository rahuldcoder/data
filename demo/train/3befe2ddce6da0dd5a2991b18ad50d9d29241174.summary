-- @entity1 is not ashamed to admit she gets hooked on " @entity2 , 90210 " reruns on @entity4 from time to time			1
" sometimes i 'll be walking through a room , and i 'll see that it 's on , and i have to stop and pay my respects and watch it , " she said			0
" then i get sucked in			0
just seeing the clothes and the makeup was so distinct to that era , you know ? it 's really fun to watch now			0
you can play drinking games to it , too , which is always a good time			2
" while in @entity18 promoting @entity19 's give one program benefitting @entity21 , the actress spoke to @entity0 about re-entering the dating scene , her former co-star @entity23 and the role that launched her career : @entity26 on " @entity2 , 90210			1
" over the course of the original " 90210 's " 1990 - 2000 run , @entity26 was shot , raped , kidnapped , addicted to cocaine , joined a cult and almost died in a fire			2
while @entity32 never got top billing , @entity26 was arguably the series ' star , looking back on " 90210 's " decade - long run			1
in fact , @entity32 pointed out that the only episode that did n't prominently feature her character was the one where the gang went to @entity42 ( because that 's what you do when you 're unemployed and just out of college )			1
" this is the ultimate sacrifice for being a mother , " said @entity32			1

the fire : " i had to wear that stupid scar makeup for months			0
" @entity26 's fellow burn victim : " the lesbian stalker , one of my favorites ! " drug addiction : " the coke days ! those were fun episodes			0
the dark eye makeup , black nails , i really went for it			0
" 2013 will mark the 20 - year high school reunion of the fictional @entity78 of ' 93 , and @entity32 is n't opposed to a potential reunion special			1
" i 've never been to a real reunion because i did n't graduate from a real high school so that would be pretty cool , " she said			2
@entity32 was hard - pressed to come up with any on - set " 90210 " secrets that the fans do n't already know , but she did come up with something rather shudder - worthy			1
" there was a vending machine at the @entity88 that had nuts and candy , " said @entity32			1
" you know those ones where you put your quarter in and out comes a handful ? it was maggots			0
there were actual maggots crawling inside it			0
" another interesting fun fact : the house where the fire episode took place was the same house used for the exteriors of the @entity109 family house in " @entity110 " and the @entity112 family house in " @entity113			0
" that house sits on the @entity115 lot in @entity116 , @entity117 , and its windows and trimmings are often altered to suit filming			0

let 's work everyday with people we actually love			2
' so we 're working on something now			0
" details about the still - in - development show remain under wraps , but @entity32 and @entity127 are developing , creating and producing it			1
@entity32 , who starred alongside @entity23 on the sitcom " @entity143 " from 2002 - 2006 , has not spoken to @entity23 since the young actress ' legal woes began mounting this year			1
" i 'll always have a special place for her in my heart , " said @entity32			1
" you ca n't play sisters with somebody for four years and not love them and take them under your wing			1
" @entity32 and her husband , actor @entity153 , split earlier this year after 11 years of marriage			1

it 's all new , this splitting of the holidays			0

" @entity32 also admitted she hates being back on the dating scene			1
" who wants to date , " she said			0
" it 's awful , and then add to it being photographed while doing it , and the scrutiny that that entails			0
" @entity32 also took the opportunity to clear up rumors that she likes mean guys			2
" it went viral that i like bad boys , like mean people			0
no , i 'm a little edgy so i like someone who has that edge			0
you can have that edge , and you might not notice it by looking at someone , but it 's in there ... i 'm into nice guys ! " @entity32 told @entity0 that she does n't have a " type , " per se			1
" it 's all about an energy , " she said			0
