-- hundreds of residents of an area contaminated by a catastrophic reactor meltdown at a nuclear plant in northeastern @entity5 have been allowed to return home three years after the disaster			1
an evacuation order , declared in the aftermath of a devastating tsunami that crippled the @entity11 nuclear plant in march , 2011 , was lifted at midnight on monday from the @entity13 district of @entity14 in @entity15			1
residents of the town , who have been in limbo ever since , are now free to re-inhabit their homes following decontamination work in the area			0
the @entity22 earthquake and subsequent tsunami off @entity5 's northeastern coast led to the worst nuclear disaster since @entity26 in 1986			2
three reactors melted down , with the resulting radiation fallout forcing nearly 140,000 people from their homes			0
around 138,000 @entity11 residents remain in temporary accommodation , with a number of cities , towns and villages reduced to ghost towns due to continued high levels of radiation			1
" we are doing as much as possible ( to allow ) the other residents can come home			0
we are strengthening support towards the residents ( and ) strengthening the decommissioning work , " a @entity42 spokesperson told @entity0			0
restrictions lifted monday 's lifting of the exclusion order is the first time an area this close to the site has been cleared			1
@entity53 is 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) from the plant , on the edge of the initial exclusion zone			1
prior to the lifting of the order , some @entity11 residents were allowed to stay overnight in their homes , subject to registration			2
all restrictions on their movements have now been lifted within the cleared district			2
355 residents -- out of a total 116 households -- are now free to return to their homes in @entity53 permanently			2
the city of @entity14 is one of eleven settlements in @entity11 that are still subject to evacuation orders			1
radiation worries however , concerns remain about background radiation levels and uncertainty surrounding the safety of the area , especially given past concerns about the reporting of radiation levels in the area by @entity11 's operator , @entity42 ( @entity42 )			1
last month , @entity13 residents were told at a community meeting that radiation contamination levels had lowered sufficiently to enable their return to the area -- though some voiced concern over existing radiation levels despite decontamination efforts around some communities			0
" yes , i am a bit worried			0
but it 's my land , my house , so i am feel safer and more at home here , " one resident told broadcaster @entity94			0
areas are declared suitable for habitation if residents are exposed to a maximum of 20 millisieverts of radiation per year			0
officials have said they would like to get radiation exposure down to one millisievert a year			0
the containment effort at the wrecked @entity11 plant has been beset by problems , with regular reports of leaks of contaminated material			1
earlier this year , an estimated 100 metric tons of highly contaminated water flowed over a barrier around a containment tank and is being absorbed into the ground , @entity42 said in a statement -- though it denied there was any leakage into the nearby @entity119			0
