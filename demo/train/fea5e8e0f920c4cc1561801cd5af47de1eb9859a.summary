" moments ago , 2 rockets fired from @entity3 hit southern @entity1			1
terrorists have violated the cease - fire , " the @entity6 wrote on @entity7			1
it was n't immediately clear how @entity1 would respond			2
the @entity6 pulled its ground forces out of @entity3 on tuesday but said they were maintaining " defensive positions " around the territory			2
" i suspect the @entity1 are going to wait to see if it was just these two rockets , " said @entity15 's @entity14			1
" these could be isolated rockets			0
" but if more rockets are fired from @entity3 , " the @entity1 will strike back , " @entity14 said			1
the two rockets landed near @entity21 in southern @entity1 but did n't cause any damage or casualties , the @entity1 military said			1
it was n't immediately clear who in @entity3 , where multiple militant factions are active , launched them			0
@entity28 , which holds power in @entity3 , denies firing the rockets , said @entity31 , a spokesman for the group			1
the allegations " are based on @entity1 reports aimed at confusing the situation , " the @entity3 - based spokesman said			1
talks in @entity38 earlier , negotiators in @entity38 had been scrambling to extend the @entity3 cease - fire , which was set to expire at 8 a.m. friday ( 1 a.m. et )			0
a @entity28 official had told supporters in @entity43 that the group was ready to resume fighting if it did n't win key concessions in the talks			1
" we are ready to return to the battle if the @entity53 demands are not met in @entity38 , " @entity28 spokesman @entity47 told a crowd of supporters waving the group 's green flags			1
a spokesman for @entity28 ' military wing , the @entity56 , was even more pointed			1
" we demand from the negotiating team to pull out from negotiations if the enemy continues to be stubborn ; we are ready for a long war , " @entity57 said on @entity28 - run @entity59 television			1

@entity1 is willing to extend the truce unconditionally , @entity85 , a senior foreign policy adviser to @entity1 prime minister @entity86 , told @entity15 on thursday			2
earlier , in a heated interview with @entity15 's @entity90 on " @entity91 , " @entity28 spokesman @entity88 said if the cease - fire was to hold , @entity1 must show signs of willingness to reach a broader deal before the truce expires			1
" there is no decision to undermine the talks , there is no decision to go back to fight , " he said			0
" but we have to evaluate what the @entity1 are doing , what the @entity1 are saying			2
" officials from @entity1 and the @entity53 side -- including @entity28 , @entity107 and the @entity108 -- are communicating through @entity67 intermediaries in an effort to reach agreement on extending the truce			1
hoping for a breakthrough a @entity53 official said thursday morning that there had been progress in the talks so far but declined to give any details			0
" i am not sure how or when it will come , but we hope for a breakthrough , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks			0
the warring sides are far apart			0
@entity1 says @entity28 must disarm as part of any larger deal that might lead to the end of border restrictions and greater economic freedom for @entity3 residents			1
@entity28 , meanwhile , says the blockade must end before a lasting peace deal can be reached			1
@entity1 must also stop activities in response to the kidnapping of three @entity1 teens who were later found dead and facilitate reconstruction of the territory 's devastated infrastructure , @entity88 told @entity15			2
" we ca n't talk about future while the @entity1 are putting a pistol to our heads or a knife to our necks , " he said			2
@entity148 told " @entity91 " that the border restrictions and @entity3 's economic and redevelopment needs ca n't be separated because they are " intimately linked			1
" " if you want cement for building homes or schools , you 've got to make sure the cement goes there and not rebuilding attack tunnels that go into @entity1 , " he said			2
he also said @entity28 ' demands for a @entity160 port raise serious security concerns for @entity1			1
" we 're of course concerned if something like that occurs , that the @entity165 or others will bring missile boats into the @entity160 and to that @entity3 port , " @entity85 said			0
" so it 's not so simple as to say , ' give them a port			0
' " latest death toll on thursday , the @entity53 @entity173 issued new casualty numbers for the conflict -- 1,888 deaths , including 446 children , and 9,804 injured			0
it 's unclear how many of the @entity53 dead were militants			0
the @entity181 has estimated that at least 70 % of the dead were civilians			0
the @entity6 believes it killed about 900 militants -- roughly half of the dead			2
@entity1 officials have said 64 @entity1 soldiers and three civilians in @entity1 died			2
additionally , about 65,000 @entity3 residents lost their homes to the fighting , according to @entity181 estimates			0
@entity193 : ' living in occupation felt normal ' @entity1 regret over civilian deaths @entity1 has come under growing international criticism over the number of civilian casualties , notably from the @entity181 , which accused the @entity1 military of shelling its shelters			1
in @entity202 on wednesday , @entity86 said @entity1 " deeply regrets " civilian deaths , accusing @entity28 of placing rockets and other military targets in crowded population centers			1
" the responsibility for this tragedy belongs with @entity28 , " @entity86 said			1
apparent evidence of the @entity1 argument came with the release of video from @entity213 24 and @entity215 's @entity214 that appears to show at least one rocket launcher located in a residential area			2
@entity15 reporters were blocked from reaching the area			0
@entity220 , the @entity108 ambassador to the @entity221 , sought to play down the significance of the launcher			0
" we do n't know the circumstances of this particular rocket launcher , " he told @entity15			0
" and if there has been incidents in which fighters from @entity53 factions fired at @entity1 from civilian populated centers , i think they were isolated centers			2
but to portray that this was the rule and not the exception is not a fair representation of what is happening in @entity3			0
" @entity88 went further , calling allegations of rocket fire from civilian areas nothing more than " @entity1 lies			0
" " we challenge anyone to prove there were any rockets launched from civilian areas , " he said			0
in fact , he said , @entity1 intentionally bombed civilians to punish @entity53 after strikes on rocket sites in open areas failed to achieve results			0
" @entity1 is murdering innocent people on purpose , " he said			0
