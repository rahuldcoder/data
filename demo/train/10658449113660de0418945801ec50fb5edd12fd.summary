-- " today is a big day for hip hop			1
" when music impresario @entity3 penned those words and posted them wednesday , he was not referring to a new album dropping or the debut of an exciting artist			0
he was talking about a male artist 's admission that his first love was a man			1
" i am profoundly moved by the courage and honesty of @entity16 , " @entity3 wrote on the site @entity13			2
" your decision to go public about your sexual orientation gives hope and light to so many young people still living in fear			2
" @entity24 , an up - and - coming @entity26 singer , recently posted on his @entity27 that the summer he was 19 years old he fell in love with a man			1
" we spent that summer , and the summer after , together , " @entity24 wrote			2
and on the days we were together , time would glide			0
most of the day i 'd see him , and his smile			0
" sleep i would often share with him , " @entity24 continued			2
" by the time i realized i was in love , it was malignant			2
there was no escaping , no negotiating to the women i had been with , the ones i cared for and thought i was in love with			0
" the revelation is significant given that it is unheard of in hip hop for male performers to admit to anything other than hardcore heterosexuality and all of the bravado that comes along with many female conquests			1
and @entity24 is a member of the hip hop collective @entity55 , whose co-founder , @entity57 , has been accused in the past of being homophobic and taken to task for his use of a gay slur in his lyrics			1
( according to online music magazine @entity64 , @entity57 used a derogatory term for gays or a variation of that term more than 200 times on his album " @entity71			0
" ) but the rapper showed his support of @entity24 via @entity74 on wednesday			1
he along with @entity3 -- who as the co-founder of @entity76 and brother of @entity79 member @entity78 is considered one of the founders of hip hop -- are not the only ones who hailed the singer for his openness			1
writer @entity87 wrote on @entity89 's site @entity96 : " you shared one of the most intimate things that ever happened to you -- falling in love with someone who was n't brave enough to love you back			2
your relieving yourself of your secret is as much about wanting to honestly connect as it is about exhibition			0
we are all made better by your decision to share publicly			0
" @entity87 noted that @entity24 made his declaration the same week as the high - profile coming out of @entity1 reporter @entity104			1
and she touches on the accusations of homophobia that have long plagued hip hop , which has also taken shots for its misogyny			1
" you 're a black man in @entity111 whose star is on the rise , working in hip - hop and soul , where gender constructs are cartoonishly fixed , " @entity87 wrote			1
@entity118 , author of the 2008 book " hiding in @entity120 : on the @entity122 in the @entity123 from @entity124 to @entity125 , " penned an open letter regarding @entity24			2
" i actually have been awaiting the day , counting down the hours and minutes as to when one of my friends , or past lovers , would be brave enough to come forward and make a public announcement ( my inhale continues to expand ) , " @entity118 said			0
" but , it was n't one of them			0
no. it was someone younger			0
an artist who is n't hindered by the old relics of @entity120 , or the entertainment school of , ' do n't you come out or it will ruin your career , ' and the record label politics			0
" so is hip hop ready to be more inclusive of @entity144 ? it 's a question that is now being hotly debated			1
the @entity146 called @entity24 's reveal " undoubtedly the glass ceiling moment for music			1
especially black music , which has long been in desperate need of a voice like @entity24 's to break the layers of homophobia			1
" in it 's article " 5 things that will come out of @entity16 's coming out " the site @entity157 predicted that " @entity120 will be forced to cool off on the homophobia			1
the fact is , @entity120 has had gay people in it for a very , very long time			0
that is a fact and far truer than people care to admit			0
but , somehow , unlike the rest of the world , the @entity163 has been slow to accept homosexuality			0

@entity168 @entity16 has gone public with his love for a man
co-founder of @entity24 's hip hop collective has been accused of homophobia
the singer is enjoying some high - profile support
