@entity0 , @entity1 -- arrest warrants issued for @entity5 president @entity4 for allegations of war crimes and genocide are illegal and should be revoked , according to two @entity10 attorneys			1
the issue of immunity for a sitting president has never been resolved , and can only be dealt with by the @entity14 , according to sir @entity15 and @entity16			0
" there is a provision in the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) charter that states should observe their obligations to other states in terms of immunity even where there is an indictment by the @entity24 , " @entity15 told reporters late saturday at the @entity19 summit , held just outside the @entity1 capital of @entity21			1
the two attorneys attended the summit as part of their work with non-governmental organizations			1
the @entity14 , based at @entity38 , @entity39 , is the principal judicial arm of the @entity41 to settle disputes between @entity41 member nations , but it has no jurisdiction to try people for war crimes or crimes against humanity			0
the @entity24 , also based at @entity38 , is an independent treaty - based organization set up in 2002 by by countries to decide cases of alleged genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes			0
according to the @entity24 's website , 111 nations have signed the treaty			2
the @entity24 has issued two warrants for @entity4 's arrest for his alleged role in a five - year campaign of violence in @entity63 in western @entity5			1
the original warrant , the first ever issued by the court against a serving head of state , included five counts of crimes against humanity , including murder , extermination , forcible transfer , torture and rape			0
it also included two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging			0
earlier this month , the @entity24 issued a second arrest warrant for @entity4 , adding three new counts of genocide			1
the court said the new charges were in addition to the earlier ones			0
@entity4 did not attend the summit , although his case is part of the agenda , and thereby did not risk arrest			1
the @entity19 earlier this year urged the court to delay war crimes proceedings against @entity4 , saying a decision to allow the genocide charges harms efforts to bring peace to @entity63			1
@entity4 has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued , even though any country that is party to the @entity24 has an obligation to hand him over to the @entity24 , the court maintains			2
leaders from several @entity105 countries have said the @entity24 has been unfair to @entity105 and have threatened to pull out of the court			2
according to the @entity108 , @entity107 and @entity16 represent two groups -- the @entity109 and the @entity110			0
the attorneys have filed a motion with the @entity24 judges asking them to reject the prosecutor 's application to issue an arrest warrant for @entity4 , the newspaper reported sunday			1
the @entity119 , @entity120 - based attorneys urged @entity19 leaders to appeal to the @entity122 to have the arrest warrants revoked , saying the issue could result in unfavorable consequences for the organization			1
they questioned whether a serving president could be vulnerable to arrest when attending events such as the summit out of obligation			2
@entity107 said the @entity19 should express the same solidarity as when it hosted @entity4 in its last summit , and also should follow the example of @entity134 , which hosted him last week			1
" the government of @entity134 took a clear position that their immunity is in place and hosted @entity4 , " @entity15 said			2
" unless all other states take this clear stand , this situation will remain a legal black hole and can potentially affect the other states			0
" they said @entity4 's case was referred to the court by a non-state party , although a case against a sitting president can only be referred by a state party			1
some ngos backed the attorneys , saying @entity105 is being unfairly targeted			1
" we are not against international law , but against the biases of the @entity24 closing its eyes on atrocities in @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 , but indicting only @entity105 leaders , " said @entity154 , who claims to head an association of 42 non-governmental organizations aimed at finding a peaceful solution to the @entity5 crisis			2
" if @entity105 leaders stand together and say ' no , ' they would have done a great job since the @entity24 is focusing only on @entity105			0
" he accused prosecutor @entity172 of asking presidents to arrest one of their own , and wondered whether sitting heads of state in @entity176 would receive the same treatment			0
@entity4 was re-elected president of @entity5 this year in controversial but historic elections			0
he has appeared to thumb his nose at the charges , appearing in public dancing and singing at a rally in @entity185 after the original arrest warrant last year			0
his information minister has dismissed the @entity24 as a " white man 's tribunal			0

@entity4 's arrest warrants should be revoked , attorneys say
the warrants have drawn *criticism* from several @entity105 nations
attorneys say @entity4 should be able to attend @entity19 summit
