@entity0 -- amid deepening public concerns over the country 's food safety following a wave of recent scandals , @entity3 's highest court has ordered judges nationwide to hand down harsher sentences , including the death penalty , to people convicted of violating food safety regulations			1
in a directive released by the state - run @entity17 news agency over the weekend , the @entity14 said in cases where people die from food safety violations , convicted suspects should be given the death sentence , while criminals involved in non-lethal cases should face longer prison terms and larger fines			1
it also called for harsher punishment for government officials found protecting food safety violators or accepting bribes from them			1
" the overall food safety situation is stable and improving , but incidents that still occur regularly have seriously endangered people 's lives and caused strong social reactions , " the directive quoted @entity33 , the country 's top judge , as saying			2
" our task to maintain food safety remains challenging			0
" from milk laced with melamine , pigs fed with performance - enhancing drugs to watermelons juiced up with growth - stimulating chemicals , a series of recent scandals have outraged @entity3 consumers , despite ramped - up government crackdown and state media campaign against food safety violations			1
from last september to april this year , @entity3 courts have tried and convicted 106 people accused of violating food safety , including two who received life imprisonment last month in a " melamine milk " case , @entity17 reported			1
" it 's clear that the credibility of the system will suffer , " said @entity61 @entity60 , the @entity63 's food safety official			0
" the ( @entity3 ) consumer will continue to lose confidence in @entity3 products and consumers abroad will equally lose confidence in @entity3 products			2
" the latest announcement by @entity3 's supreme court , however , seems to run counter to another recent initiative to limit the use of the death penalty by the same court			2
in its annual work report , the @entity14 last week instructed lower courts to suspend death sentences for two years if an immediate execution is not deemed necessary			0
the @entity3 legislature had earlier amended the country 's penal code to reduce the number of crimes punishable by death by 13 to 55			0
@entity3 executes more people than all other countries combined , according to @entity91			1
it estimated the figure , considered a state secret , to be in the thousands last year for " a wide range of crimes that include non-violent offences			0
" the number of executions elsewhere in the world in 2010 was at least 527 , according to the @entity102 - based group 's annual report released earlier this year			0
@entity1 's @entity103 contributed to this report .			0
