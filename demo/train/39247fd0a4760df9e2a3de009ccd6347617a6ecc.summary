@entity1 architect @entity0 has little patience for bad design			1
he also dislikes the ugly things he sees in hospitals			1
when he stayed at a rehabilitation center recovering from a rare , life - threatening infection , @entity0 eyed the magenta - and - green floral sheets on his bed			1
" it 's far too ugly for me to die here , " he quipped in october at @entity10 , a conference about great ideas in health care			2
it got worse as he stayed at eight different hospitals and three rehabilitation centers adjusting to life in a wheelchair			1
" they did n't make big mistakes , " @entity0 said about various designs he observed in hospitals and rehab centers			1
" they just made the most frustrating mistakes you could ever imagine and made your cure more difficult			2
your room should make it easier for the doctors and the aides and the patient			2
but instead it does just the opposite			2
" @entity0 is one of the most revered living architects and has won numerous prizes in his field			1
critics have hailed him as one of the original @entity1 voices in architecture as he has designed hundreds of buildings for corporations , governments , foundations and universities such as the @entity50 building in @entity51 , @entity52			1
he has been praised for making buildings functional as well as aesthetically pleasing			2
for many @entity1 , @entity0 might be best known as the designer of affordable household items sold at @entity56			1
the @entity0 line includes practical items from tea kettles and drying racks to whimsical kitchen equipment like avocado scoopers and large bamboo salad tongs			1
his @entity56 line came with a simple , idealistic premise : " good design should be affordable to all			2
" now @entity0 wants to extend his philosophy to hospitals			1
he became familiar with healthcare facilities eight years ago after a freak infection left him paralyzed			1
doctors still can not identify what caused the illness			1
in 2003 , @entity0 , in high demand , kept a hectic schedule			1
while in @entity78 on a business trip , he developed a cold he could n't shake			2
" my immune system was pretty low because of stress , " he said			2
" i was standing on a site in @entity83 , where it was below 0 [ degrees ] , all day long , with a terrible cold			2
" the symptoms spread to his lower back			2
@entity0 returned to the states and went to work the next morning , but the crippling pain only got worse			1
he went to the hospital , " and by the next morning , i was paralyzed from the chest down , " he said			1
doctors could n't identify the infection			2
they have ruled out meningitis			0
@entity0 has been told about four other people in the @entity1 have the same mystery illness			1
the condition is so rare that there is n't a name for it			0
the sinus infection travels to the brain , then to the spine , causing paralysis			0
" my spinal cord is n't cut , " he explained			0
" it looks like the bottom of a sunken ship			0
" this meant @entity0 , an avid golfer and traveler , could no longer enjoy long walks on the green and strolls on @entity115 's cobblestone streets throughout his recovery , @entity0 became frustrated with his hospitals and facilities			1
at a rehabilitation center , he wheeled himself into the bathroom one morning			0
when @entity0 reached for the sink faucet for hot water , the handle was out of reach			1
toothpaste ? also out of reach			0
toothbrush ? out of reach			0
so he looked for an outlet for his electric razor			0
the outlet was near the base of the wall near the floor -- also out of his reach from the wheelchair			0
the biggest aggravation , he said , was that the rehabilitation center was built for people in wheelchairs			0
" when i went through some of the struggles that were caused by my room , i lost the self empowerment that i was supposedly gaining during the day in rehabilitation , " said @entity0			1
" i was no longer self - reliant , but dependent			1
this makes you feel terrible as a patient ... as a paraplegic			0
you 're feeling at the will of others			0
" he stayed at one glossy , new hospital with a four - story glass atrium and expansive lobbies			1
but that hospital 's patient rooms were so small that those in wheelchairs and hospital employees had a hard time maneuvering			0
" all the money had been spent on the public spaces , " he said			0
" the public spaces were glorious			0
i got to the patient room , these were the smallest patient rooms ever known to man			0
" channeling all his frustration , @entity0 continued to sketch			1
" whether i was paralyzed or not , i would draw , because drawing for me is like playing the piano , " he said			1
" you 've got to keep practicing , got to keep doing it			0
it 's not that you lose it , but you do n't draw as well if you do n't draw every day			0
" he started sketching better ways to design the hospital -- furniture , rooms , buildings			1
these sketches are becoming a reality as @entity0 ' company has teamed up with a hospital furnishing company called @entity182			1
the products became available in 2009			0
@entity0 designed chairs with larger handles , so it 's easier for a person to hoist themselves to stand			1
a bedside cabinet has a rounded edge and two - way drawer to access items from both sides			2
@entity0 has employees of his company spend a week in wheelchairs to understand patients ' needs			1
" i 'm impatient with getting it wrong , because if you spend the time and you use your intellect , you can get it			0
and there is no excuse for getting those patient rooms wrong time after time , " he said			0
@entity208 ' interest in architecture now extends to building better hospitals , facilities and home care environments			2
" this is my life now , " he said			0
" i had to give up golf , give up walking			0
i had to give up a lot of things , give up driving			0
it is n't so bad			0
" i take on health care			0
i would n't have been a health care nut if it had n't been for my paralysis , so something good came from this			0
