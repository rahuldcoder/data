@entity1 , @entity0 -- when i was in law school , my criminal law professor introduced us to the crime of rape by reading us a quote from lord chief justice sir @entity10 , a 17th - century @entity11 jurist : " in a rape case it is the victim , not the defendant , who is on trial			1
" it was not merely a history lesson			0
while a student in my final year of college , at age 21 , i was raped			2
i have dissected that moment -- the horrifying moment that i became a " victim " -- from every possible angle			0
i have poked and prodded , examined and re-examined			0
regrettably , i have even suspected myself in a desperate , ultimately futile attempt to understand how i became a victim			0
but blaming myself was neither my idea nor my first inclination			0
i thought such 17th - century notions were long dead			0
people who did not even know me were quick to comment or speculate on my rape			2
what were you wearing ? did you scream loudly ? did this occur in public ? ' legitimate rape ' reaction , from the @entity40 to black crickets as my history lesson said , i found myself on trial , facing the most fierce judge and jury : ignorance			1
eight years after my rape , i find myself on trial against ignorance again			2
rep. @entity51 's recent comments that " legitimate rape " rarely results in pregnancy not only flout scientific fact but , for me , cut deeper			2
@entity51 has de-legitimized my rape			2
you see , nine months after my rape , i gave birth to a beautiful little girl			1
you could say she was conceived in rape ; she was			1
but she is also so much more than her beginnings			0
i blissfully believed that after i finally had decided to give birth to and to raise my daughter , life would be all roses and endless days at the playground			1
it would not be long before i would learn firsthand that in the vast majority of states -- 31 -- men who father through rape are able to assert the same custody and visitation rights to their children that other fathers enjoy			1
when no law prohibits a rapist from exercising these rights , a woman may feel forced to bargain away her legal rights to a criminal trial in exchange for the rapist dropping the bid to have access to her child			2
opinion : wake up , it 's not just @entity51 when faced with the choice between a lifetime tethered to her rapist or meaningful legal redress , the answer may be easy , but it is not painless			2
for the sake of her child , the woman will sacrifice her need to see her once immensely powerful perpetrator humbled by the court			0
i know it because i lived it			0
i went to law school to learn how to stop it			0
having fought this injustice for the past several years , i have come to believe that ignorance is to blame for this legal absence			0
opponents argue no woman would ever choose to raise the child she conceived through rape			1
the only two studies to analyze the choices made by pregnant raped women indicate otherwise -- at least 30 % of women who conceive by rape make this choice			1
others argue that no rapist would ever seek parental rights			1
not only does my experience and that of others i know prove otherwise , but it is not surprising that a man who cruelly degrades a woman would also seek to torture her in an even more agonizing way , by seeking access to her child			0
today , it seems we may face a new and unbelievable challenge : convincing legislators that women can conceive when they are raped			1
@entity137 : ' rape is rape ' make no mistake , my efforts and the efforts of others to persuade legislators to pass laws restricting the parental rights of men who father through rape will be directly impacted by @entity51 's recent comments			1
whether these efforts will be helped or hurt , however , depends upon us as a society			0
either we will fight ignorance and take steps to legislate for raped women based upon reason and facts , or we will be led by ignorance and continue to make bad laws			1
or fail to make good ones			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			1

@entity161 had a baby conceived in a rape and faced another *unexpected* ordeal
@entity161 found the majority of states give parental rights to men who father through rape
she became a lawyer to fight this practice and *encourage* states to make this *illegal*
she says many women who are raped become pregnant and give birth
