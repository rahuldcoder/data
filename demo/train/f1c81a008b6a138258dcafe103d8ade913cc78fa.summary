-- faced with some of driest conditions @entity4 has seen in nearly a century , firefighters around the state are struggling to fight off what a forest service official on sunday called the " perfect storm for wildfires			1
" april @entity9 , a spokeswoman with the @entity10 , said crews were having difficulty getting hundreds of blazes under control due to a rare combination of strong winds , unseasonably warm temperatures and low humidity			2
conditions this spring are the driest they 've been in @entity4 since 1917 , she claimed			1
authorities have responded to 7,807 fires across more than 1.5 million acres since this year 's wildfire season began , gov. @entity20 wrote in a letter late saturday to president @entity25 requesting that the federal government declare @entity4 a disaster area			1
these have affected all but two of the state 's 254 counties			0
on sunday , some 1,300 personnel representing 34 states were on the front lines battling these fires			1
and , unless there is a drastic and sustained change in conditions , @entity9 said she expects the fight to continue for several months more			1
" we 're looking at this as a marathon , not a sprint , " she said			0
" we 're very committed to this			0
" to that end , @entity20 's request to federal authorities -- which he made late saturday and announced sunday -- was an attempt to expedite federal assistance			1
" i have determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments , and that supplementary federal assistance is necessary , " the governor wrote in his letter to @entity25 , sent through a @entity4 - based @entity53 official			1
@entity9 noted that rural areas and more populated areas like @entity65 have been affected -- though she added that there have been no civilian casualties and problems with numerous evacuations that have taken place			1
the governor noted that one firefighter has died and 18 others have been injured , while 244 homes have been destroyed and another 8,514 threatened residences " saved			0
" " the wildland fire risk potential has reached a critically high level , " @entity20 said			0
these conditions " present a serious hazard to the lives and property of the citizens of the state			1
" new and evolving wildfires prompted three sets of evacuations sunday , all while crews tried to prevent further damage all around the state			1
the @entity10 announced in a statement that , as of 2:15 p.m. sunday , people were being ordered to evacuate from @entity91 and other parts of @entity93 and @entity94 in @entity95			0
@entity91 's population of 764 , the forest agency said , is endangered by a fire fanned by strong winds and fueled by " extremely dry " conditions in north central @entity4			1
people in other parts of @entity93 , including those in about 300 homes and a campground in the @entity106 on @entity107 , have also been told to leave			0
@entity9 explained that these actions are part of a trio of nearby fires that , collectively , have burned 55,000 acres			2
numerous resources -- including three helitankers ( helicopters that dump water ) , two @entity117 helicopters and three 20 - man crews -- have been brought in , she said			0
a 2,200 - acre fire imperiled @entity94 , where 40 people lived in 2000 , according to the @entity121			0
two hours later , the forest service noted that evacuations were " in progress " in @entity124 , home of the state capital of @entity65			1
that fire , while smaller than many others at 60 acres , raised alarms as it crept near 100 homes , 10 businesses and @entity132			2
the forest service update , posted online at 4:19 p.m. sunday , said " extreme fire behavior is being exhibited , " though no additional information was immediately available			1
@entity136 did n't appear to be doing firefighters any favors			0
sustained winds in many locales were blowing 20 to 25 mph from the south this weekend , and gusting even stronger			0
and the long - term forecast did n't look much better			0
the forecast in @entity93 for instance , called for high temperatures in the mid- 90s through tuesday , according to the @entity146			0
in @entity65 , temperatures are expected to hit or surpass 90 all week			2
" with the winds that we 've got today , it 's hard to be aggressive with any suppression activities ; it 's just too dangerous to get in front of that type of fire , " @entity10 spokesman @entity148 told @entity0 affiliate @entity149			0
" the fires we 're experiencing in some cases are moving four or five miles an hour			0
that 's the length of a football field every minute			0
" as of saturday , @entity10 personnel were responding to at least 14,758 acres of new fires -- five of them major -- that broke out during the day			2
a blend of potent winds , dense growth of flammable material and low humidity have made this a challenging season for firefighters in the state , with 195 @entity4 counties banning any burning in a bid to prevent more blazes			1
the biggest of the new fires saturday was in @entity177 , where more than 150 homes were threatened and ultimately saved in the town of @entity180 , according to the forest service			1
that 7,500 - acre fire was 40 % contained as of 11 a.m. sunday			2
a 1,440 - acre fire in @entity184 burning in mostly pine forest 20 miles northwest of @entity186 and 800 acres that imperiled 40 homes in @entity189 some 10 miles northeast of @entity190 were both 50 % contained			1
two @entity117 helicopters , from the @entity192 , were called in to assist with the latter blaze , the @entity10 said			0
some 1,850 acres in @entity194 were threatened by a new 1,400 - acre fire in @entity196 that was 75 % contained , and forces had batted down an even higher percentage of the 2,000 - acre blaze burning in @entity200 , six miles northeast of @entity201			2
all these blazes paled in size to several others elsewhere in @entity4			2
the biggest this season has been the so - called @entity207 fire that spanned more than 182,000 acres in @entity208 and @entity210 counties			1
that blaze , which destroyed 23 homes and two businesses , is 70 % contained			0
in @entity215 , north of @entity216 , crews had only managed to contain 10 % of 130,000 acres of what 's being called the @entity219 fire			2
the @entity10 said late sunday afternoon that this blaze was moving north and northwest , making it a threat to the county seat of @entity224 and its 1,171 residents			0
new resources were brought in this weekend to fight this fire , with the state agency saying crews planned to approach it from the south			1
another major wildfire centered in @entity232 -- spanning 152,000 acres in @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity236 counties -- was half - contained as of sunday morning , with shifting winds the previous day pushing the flames toward @entity239			1
@entity0 's @entity240 contributed to this report .			0
