the @entity0 announced tuesday that it will not pursue federal criminal civil rights charges against @entity3 police officers who shot and killed a knife - wielding homeless man in july 2012			1
authorities said there was insufficient " evidence of willful misconduct " to warrant a federal criminal prosecution of the @entity11 officers who fired 46 bullets at @entity13 , 49 , during an argument			1
@entity15 was hit 11 times			1
the incident occurred july 1 , 2012 , in a parking lot next to a shuttered @entity20 restaurant , in full view of passing motorists			1
a video of the incident was obtained exclusively by @entity25 weeks later			0
the @entity27 prosecutor and the @entity3 attorney general had declined to prosecute the officers			2
" after a careful review of all of the evidence , experienced prosecutors from the @entity32 of the @entity33 and the @entity34 for the @entity35 of @entity3 have determined that the evidence in this case is insufficient to prove , beyond a reasonable doubt , that the @entity11 officers willfully shot @entity15 for an unlawful purpose , rather than for their stated purpose of preventing @entity15 from harming @entity11 staff , " the @entity0 said in a statement			1
the statement continued : " even if the officers were mistaken in their assessment of the threat posed by @entity15 , this would not establish that the officers acted willfully , or with an unlawful intent , when using deadly force against @entity15			1
" @entity15 's family said he had a history of mental illness			2
at the time of the shooting , then - @entity27 police chief @entity56 said @entity15 was " known to be an assaultive person " with " a long history " of contacts with law enforcement , " not only with police from our department , but with the county			1
" in the video purchased by @entity25 , shot by a motorist from across the street , @entity15 was seen arguing with a half dozen officers			1
for more than three minutes he walks back and forth , and at one time appears to crouch in a " karate stance , " according to the man who captured the scene			0
police said @entity15 had just had a run - in with a convenience store clerk			2
on the video , he tells police , " my name is @entity13 , i just called 911			2
my name is @entity13 , and i 'm p --- ed off			2
" when an officer tells him to put the knife down , he responds , " i ai n't putting s -- t down			0
" he appears unimpressed by a police dog , telling officers , " let him go			0
let the motherf --- ing dog go			0
" finally , @entity15 turns to the left of the frame , where another officer had moved out of view a short time earlier			0
that 's when the police open fire with a reported 46 shots in a five - second hail of bullets			1
the on - site police supervisor was demoted to patrolman , police said afterward			0
two others were disciplined for violating department policies in connection with the shooting			0
three of their five dash - cam video cameras were not working properly			0
in a statement , @entity15 , @entity13 's mother , said she was not surprised by tuesday 's development			1
" however , that decision does not negate the civil litigation that we can pursue and the standards in that matter are less stringent and we believe justice will prevail			0
" the family filed a wrongful death lawsuit last year against the police department and the officers involved in the shooting after conducting its own investigation and consulting two nationally known experts in police practices , lawyers for the family said .			0
