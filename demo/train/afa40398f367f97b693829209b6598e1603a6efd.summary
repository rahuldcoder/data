@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 officials said thursday the first test of a rescue capsule designed to rescue 33 trapped miners was carried out successfully			1
" we did a test with a capsule in a tube 12 meters long , " said engineer @entity7			1
" we were trying to see how the capsule functions in the tube -- the wheels , the springs -- and that works perfect			1
" once one of the three drills working to reach the trapped miners breaks through , a rescue capsule will be lowered at least 600 meters ( 1,968 feet ) to begin ferrying the men to the surface			1
before the capsule goes down , though , officials said , metal casing or tubes would have to be lowered into the hole to provide a buffer between the capsule and rock			1
" we will need to build a platform and bring heavy winches that can lift 400 tons , " @entity7 said , " you can imagine how big they are , we will need to position them			1
the casing could take take 48 hours to implement			0
" @entity37 adviser @entity36 said that by october 8 , all the personnel and equipment rescuers need -- including two additional rescue capsules and a field hospital to immediately treat the miners -- will be on site			1
officials said the tentative date they are setting for the rescue is the beginning of november but that they will be ready for a potential rescue as early as the end of next week			1
the @entity54 drill continued to lead the efforts to free the men , reaching a depth of 333 meters ( 1,092 feet ) on thursday , the government 's rescue coordinator @entity51 said			1
the drill was taken offline for about six hours after it lost pressure while hammering at the tough @entity1 rock , officials said			0
on tuesday the @entity54 drill passed the halfway point to the miners , spurring a celebration in @entity65 , the makeshift tent village where many of the miners ' family members anxiously wait			0
the plan a drill -- a mining drill -- reached 148 meters ( 486 feet ) , but the hole it was drilling would still need to be widened to 70 centimeters ( 27.5 inches ) to accommodate the rescue capsule			1
the @entity74 drill -- an enormous oil drilling platform that dominates the rescue site -- had reached 156 meters ( 512 feet ) , @entity51 said			2
@entity51 said that officials were working with physicians and psychologists to determine the order in which miners would be pulled from the mine , but said no decision had been made			2
meanwhile , the miners continued to aid with their own rescue by clearing rock that had fallen into the mine as a result of the drilling			2
the miners used front - loader machines that were not damaged in the collapse to clear the rubble			0
officials said the miners were clearing about eight tons of rock every 12 hours to keep the mine shaft clear			1
officials had no comment on a lawsuit filed thursday by some of the miners ' family members against the @entity102 , which owns the mine , and the government for negligence			2
an attorney for 27 of the miners families filed the lawsuit , which seeks $ 12 million ( @entity108 ) from the mine and government for harm inflicted on the men			2
@entity1 government officials has criticized the mine for not having the right safety measures in place			0
@entity1 president @entity116 dismissed several officials in charge of mine safety after the cave - in			0
" everyone who is here recognizes and appreciates the work being done by the rescue workers , " said lawyer @entity121			0
" this has nothing to do with one government or another but we have to ask why are these miners at the bottom of a mine ? " the mining company did not return calls seeking comment			0
@entity136 is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings and its assets are being sought by creditors			0
government officials have also said the company will bear the cost of the army of rescue workers and drilling teams being flown in from around the world			2
at @entity65 , several relatives said they had not participated in the action and the lawsuit was of of little interest to them			0
said family member @entity152 : " i just want to get my brother out			0
" @entity155 's @entity154 and @entity156 contributed to this report .			0

" we did a test with a capsule in a tube 12 meters long , " engineer says
