-- with the announcement that @entity5 's long - lost remains -- curved spine and all -- are to be buried at @entity7 on march 26 , 2015 , the @entity2 city is set for another spike in tourist numbers driven by the dead monarch			1
this time around though , there 'll be plenty for visitors to look at			0
it 's all a far cry from those first , excited days after the discovery was announced in 2012 , which saw locals and tourists alike lining up for hours around the block to look at a hole in the ground			0
back then there were no bells and whistles , just a strip of scraped - back asphalt , a couple of muddy trenches and the all - important grave , marked with a handful of yellow pegs and a copy of @entity5 's portrait , laminated to keep out the drizzle			1
the grave is still there , of course , but after months of scientific tests , massive controversy and a costly court case , it 's now surrounded by @entity40 's newest attraction , the @entity41			2
the museum , which opened with much fanfare recently , tells the story of the " three ds " of @entity5 : his dynasty , explaining the complex family history which led to the bloody @entity48 ; his death , at the @entity50 in 1485 , defeated by @entity51 and later flung into an unmarked grave ; and finally , the discovery of his remains			1
@entity56 , director of the new visitor center , explains : " we start with the medieval soap opera of @entity5 's rise to power , the @entity48 and the 500 years of controversy that followed , and then we tell the key part of the story : the discovery			1
" ' beyond reasonable doubt ' it 's this part , the tale of how a @entity41 of @entity67 could lie unknown and unacknowledged for centuries , most recently beneath a municipal parking lot , only to be found by a group of archeologists as stunned by what they 'd found as the rest of us -- and with just enough clues to identify him -- that has fascinated people around the world			1
the museum shows how the excavation was carried out , and explains the complicated series of tests carried out to prove " beyond reasonable doubt " that the remains were indeed @entity5 's			1
there 's even a replica skeleton on display so people can see for themselves the fatal blow to the head that felled the @entity41 on the battlefield , and the distinctive curved spine that gave rise to the myth of the evil , deformed monarch portrayed by @entity97			2
@entity56 says that before it had even opened , the center had sold tickets to visitors from as far afield as @entity101 and @entity102 , @entity103 , the @entity104 and @entity105			0
" we had people walking past the door asking ' is it open yet , is it open yet ? ' and @entity101 tourists desperate to know if it would be ready before they flew home , " he says			0
international attention @entity56 adds that interest in all things @entity5 - related remains high -- a temporary exhibition at the city 's @entity118 nearby attracted 200,000 visitors in a year , and local authorities hope the tourists will keep coming			1
the area between the grave site and visitor center -- housed in an old school -- and the cathedral , where the much - tested remains will be reinterred is being redeveloped , with new gardens linking the two , and part of the cathedral itself is being remodeled to make way for the new royal tomb			0
the idea is that tourists will be able to spend an entire day on the @entity5 tour			2
they 'll take in the @entity50 site , just outside the city , to see where he 's thought to have died , the visitor center , to learn more of his story , and finally the cathedral , to visit his grave			2
thankfully , there 's now plenty more to see than the original hole in the ground , though that 'll remain the focal part of a trip to the new museum			0
the hole takes pride of place in a church - like quiet room , the floor covered with glass so that people can look down into the grave itself			0
there is though , a nod to the high - tech era -- at certain times of the day , lighting effects make it appear as though his bones are still in the grave			0
in the visitor center , as well as the minds of many visitors , he will remain the @entity41 in the parking lot			1
@entity174 , @entity175 , @entity40 ; tickets Â £ 7.95 ( $ 13.40 )			0
