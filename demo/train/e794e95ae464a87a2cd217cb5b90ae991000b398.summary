-- improper wiring by military contractor @entity2 at @entity4 bases in @entity5 led to electrical shocks about once every three days for nearly two years , according to @entity8 documents obtained by @entity0			1
sgt. @entity9 , a 24 - year - old @entity10 , died in a shower at his base in @entity5 in january 2008			0
@entity13 , @entity14 - based @entity2 , the military contractor responsible for maintaining and providing services at most of @entity4 bases across @entity5 , had " systemic failures " in its electrical work that threatened the life , health and safety of people inside the bases , according to the documents , from a violation report obtained by @entity0			1
there were 231 electrical shocks of personnel in @entity5 from september 2006 through july 2008 in facilities maintained by @entity2 , the documents state			1
@entity2 has been at the center of controversy surrounding the electrocution of soldiers on bases in @entity5			1
much of the controversy has surrounded the electrocution of sgt. @entity9 , a highly decorated 24 - year old @entity10 from @entity38 , @entity39			0
@entity9 was electrocuted in a shower on a @entity4 base in @entity42 , @entity5 , on january 2 , 2008			1
at least 18 troops have been electrocuted in @entity5 since 2003 , and many of the electrocutions have been attributed to shoddy electrical work done on @entity4 bases -- work managed by @entity4 contractors -- according to @entity8 sources			1
each of the electrocutions has occurred in different locations and under various circumstances			0
the violation report shows that electrical shocks and problems with wiring and grounding continued for much of last year , long after @entity9 's electrocution			0
@entity60 , a @entity2 spokesperson , said the company could not comment on the specific language in the document obtained by @entity0 because @entity2 had not seen it			0
but the company has previously said that " @entity2 found no link between work it 's been asked to perform and the reported electrocutions " and that " @entity2 remains committed to the safety and security of all employees and those the company serves			1
we have fully cooperated with the government when issues have been raised about work in @entity5 and we will continue to do so			2
" on the death of @entity9 , the company has said , " @entity2 's investigation has produced no evidence that @entity2 was responsible for sgt. @entity9 's death			1
we have cooperated fully with all government agencies investigating this matter and will do so in the future			0
" last week , @entity0 obtained other documents that show the @entity87 investigator assigned to look into @entity9 's electrocution blamed @entity2 for the death , stating that she believed the cause was " negligent homicide " and that there is " credible information that @entity2 's negligence led to @entity9 's death			2
" the revelations about the frequency of shocks on bases are found in the complete and detailed report that led to @entity2 's citation for being in serious violation of its contract several months ago			1
at that time , the @entity8 's @entity103 gave @entity2 what is known as a " @entity105			2
" that is issued only when a contractor is found in " serious non-compliance " and is just one step below the possibility of suspending or terminating a contract , @entity8 officials said			0
while that violation citation was previously known , the report 's precise language and details of @entity2 's alleged " failures " were not known until now			1
the 45 - page report alleges @entity2 had improper electrical wiring , grounding and overall electrical problems across @entity5			2
" the government found systemic @entity2 failures to properly ground and bond facilities -- failures that contributed to theater personnel receiving shocks in @entity2 maintained facilities on average once every three days " between september 2006 and july 31 , 2008 , the detailed report says			1
that information , the report says , came from @entity2 's own statistical records			1
" the conditions of these facilities created life , @entity137 , @entity138 ( @entity140 ) conditions for the occupants			0
the lack of grounding and bonding , among other electrical deficiencies " were " identified and confirmed by three separate independent inspection teams " from the @entity148 , the @entity143 and a multinational force working with fire and electricity , the report states			0
" most facilities inspected had electrical deficiencies because @entity2 failed to consistently follow contract standards every time it constructed or emplaced a facility , inspected a facility , responded to a service order request , or performed maintenance and / or repairs on facilities , generators and utilities , " the report says			2
also , the report says , " the government is unaware of any efforts undertaken by @entity2 to independently identify , assess , and implement corrective actions to its electrical support services or quality control inspection program as a result of the extensive number of electrical shock incidents			2
... " sen. @entity174 , @entity39 , said his office has received numerous anecdotal reports of @entity4 military personnel continuing to receive electric shocks			0
" while @entity2 continues to assure the @entity4 people that it has completed its own investigations and has found no evidence of corporate wrongdoing , the emerging facts prove otherwise , " @entity174 said			0
" according to an internal investigation led by the @entity8 's contract auditors , we now know that @entity2 failed to comply with basic contractual requirements even while being rewarded with billions of dollars by @entity4 taxpayers			1
" @entity174 called on the @entity8 " to treat this issue for the danger it represents			0
" the @entity8 , he said , " has taken some encouraging actions [ but ] it needs to do much more			0
" " and it is high time that @entity2 begin to suffer real consequences for what i consider to be blatant contractual noncompliance , " @entity174 said .			0
