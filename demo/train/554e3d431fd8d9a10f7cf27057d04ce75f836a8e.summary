editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity5 ) -- the first time i went to @entity20 , in 2010 , i was arrested just two days into my trip			1
filming a documentary for vice , i was detained for shooting where the authorities thought i should n't , beginning endless rounds of questions , emphatic yelling and head - shaking incredulity at my claims of innocence -- and , of course , the requisite implications that i was a spy			0
when i was finally released , i swore i would never return to the @entity20			1
but that promise was quickly broken , and i found myself back in the country almost exactly a year later , in the midst of a chaotic and violent revolution			0
my second trip to @entity20 consisted of traveling from the @entity39 border to @entity40 and then onto the front lines in @entity42 , embedding with a few different rebel groups along the way			1
i was shocked by how young many of them were			2
barely past puberty and fighting with whatever they could find ( one guy had a spear gun ) , they displayed so much heroism and courage that i would tear up while talking to them			2
one rebel i spoke with had left the hospital earlier that night -- despite having lost a leg -- so that he could get back to the front lines			1
he was offered a flight to @entity63 and a new prosthetic limb by an @entity65 , but instead snuck out of the hospital to rejoin his comrades			0
but the big question looming over everything was : " why are they fighting ? " everyone i asked -- bankers , shop clerks , students , construction workers , oil engineers and @entity78 loyalists -- offered the same answer : " @entity80			1
" it was like the end of @entity83 every time a rebel looked into my eyes and said it			2
one 16 - year - old told me , " i will die so the others can at least breathe free air			0
" @entity93 stuff for a teenager , especially when most of the rebels are n't old enough to have known a political system other than @entity96			2
risking your life for freedom is one thing			2
but risking it for the concept of freedom is something else entirely			0
see the rest of @entity106 of @entity20 at @entity5 when we finally got to @entity42 , it was surrounded by @entity110 's troops and only accessible by sea			1
we slowly made our way toward the front , stopping periodically to talk to rebels			1
one 15 - year - old boy i met was preparing a grad - missile truck for battle			0
beaming , he wondered whether i could " ask @entity120 and @entity121 for new weapons " so that they could beat @entity110 and he could fulfill his dream of playing for the @entity125 or the @entity126			0
as we talked , it struck me how much had changed in such a short period			0
this was a different @entity20 than the one i experienced last year -- a completely new country .			1

@entity5 embeds with rebel groups on the front lines in @entity20
journalists were *surprised* by how young some rebels were
when asked why they were fighting , " freedom " was the common answer
