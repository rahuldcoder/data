a typical @entity87 to @entity6 flight took a little less than three and a half hours , as opposed to about eight hours for subsonic flights			0
modern commercial long - haul jets typically cruise at speeds between 480 and 560 mph .			0

@entity11 - based @entity13 and @entity18 announce collaboration on @entity13 supersonic business jet
deal " kicks the ( supersonic ) program into high gear , " says @entity13 ceo
