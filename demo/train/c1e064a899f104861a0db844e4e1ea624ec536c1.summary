speaking of her early days with @entity14 , she reflects on her interaction with other members of the group : " i was initially looking for spiritual understanding of @entity6 and they were trying to say that spirituality is important but their main focus was on politics and that the politics was just as spiritual in @entity6			1
" she learned soon that the main aim of the group was a call for " @entity43 , " establishing a @entity45 state			0
