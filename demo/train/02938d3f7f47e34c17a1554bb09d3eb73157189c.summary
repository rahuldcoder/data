@entity0 , @entity1 -- four suspected militants were killed and seven arrested in @entity1 in a security forces operation targeting those responsible for a devastating weekend bombing on the outskirts of the city of @entity9 that left scores dead , authorities said tuesday			1
police said a suicide bomber rammed a water tanker laden with explosives into a crowded marketplace saturday , setting off a huge blast that killed at least 89 people and wounded at least 180 others			1
@entity19 in @entity9 had refused to bury those killed in the devastating bombing until authorities responded to their demands to take military action against @entity26 extremists thought to be responsible			1
following tuesday 's operation , they announced that the burial will begin at 9 a.m. wednesday			1
the macabre protest , now in its third day , is an expression of the anger and frustration among @entity19 in the southwestern province of @entity34 , whose capital is @entity9 , over the government 's failure to shield them from bloody sectarian attacks in recent months			1
" we want the military to protect @entity19 and want it to take control of law and order in the province , " @entity40 , president of the @entity41 and the organizer of the protest , said monday			0
" civilian government has failed to maintain law and order in the province			0
" the outlawed @entity26 militant group @entity53 has said it carried out the saturday attack			2
the bodies of about 80 of the victims -- some in coffins , others wrapped in sheets -- have been laid out on the street in @entity61 , the @entity19 suburb of @entity9 where the attack took place , said @entity64 , the health secretary in @entity34			1
authorities are still trying to identify the other bodies , he said			0
hundreds of demonstrators in @entity61 have braved the winter cold to stay out day and night with the victims ' bodies			2
" what is our sin ? why are our people being killed ? " said @entity73 , a teenager at the protest who said her brother was among the dead			1
" why are we being killed for our faith ? " she continued , breaking into tears			1
the bombing , which has prompted demonstrations in cities across @entity26 - majority @entity1 , follows a day of bomb attacks targeting @entity19 in @entity9 last month that killed at least 85 people			1
@entity53 also claimed responsibility for those attacks			0
desperate protest the @entity19 community 's decision to delay the burial of the bodies this week , a form of protest they also adopted after the january bombings , is a sign of its desperation after repeated requests to authorities for better protection			1
not burying dead bodies immediately after death is taboo in @entity103 ; a person 's soul is not considered to be at rest until the body is in the ground			2
the @entity1 government in @entity0 said tuesday that it would carry out " a targeted operation aimed at eliminating those responsible for playing with lives of innocent civilians and restoring peace and security in @entity9			1
" and a senior @entity9 police official , @entity116 , said security forces carried out a raid in the city monday night in which four militants were killed and seven were arrested			1
it was not immediately clear if any of these announcements were enough to satisfy the @entity19 community 's demands			2
@entity34 security officials were negotiating with the protesters to try to persuade them to end their demonstration and bury the dead			2
the government had vowed monday to catch the perpetrators and bring them to justice			0
but human rights groups say authorities have a bad track record of prosecuting those who carry out and incite attacks on @entity19			0
prime minister @entity138 has sent a delegation of lawmakers to @entity9 to assess the situation and make recommendations			1
he has also requested that intelligence agencies explain how the suicide bomber managed to breach security measures			1
@entity138 's announcements monday came as protests over the attack spread beyond @entity34 to other parts of @entity1 , including major cities such as @entity152 and @entity0 , local media reported			2
a persecuted minority the @entity19 community primarily targeted by @entity53 in @entity34 are @entity155 , an ethnic minority from neighboring @entity157			0
@entity158 said monday it had documented 91 separate attacks on @entity19 across @entity1 since january 2012 that had resulted in the deaths of about 500 people			2
at least half of those killed were @entity155 , @entity158 said , even though they are one of the smallest ethnic groups in @entity1			2
" the last two months have been the worst on record for @entity9 's beleaguered @entity73 community , " said @entity166 , deputy @entity167 director at @entity158			1
" in fact , the attacks in january and february constitute some of the worst killings in @entity1 's recent history			0
" @entity158 urged @entity1 authorities to " immediately carry out an impartial and independent investigation into the persistent failure of civil and military authorities to end such attacks			0
" a lack of prosecutions the rights group said that to its knowledge , " no one has been prosecuted for the january 2013 attacks or other targeted killings of @entity155 in recent years			0
" the bombing saturday also drew condemnation from the office of @entity191 secretary - general @entity190 and the @entity192 of @entity1			1
the commission said it was " at a loss for words at this latest catastrophe to befall the long - suffering hazaras of @entity34			0
" @entity53 has tried to justify its attacks by arguing that according to its interpretation of @entity103 , @entity19 are not @entity19			0
it claims @entity19 insult close companions of the @entity103 prophet , @entity202			0
but human rights groups are scathing in their criticism of the group			0
