@entity0 -- the women talked about it at the gym , caring for their children , over drinks and dinner and in the hallways of @entity9			1
more than 200 @entity11 schoolgirls were gone , kidnapped from their beds by an armed terrorist group , @entity13 , who vowed to sell them into forced child marriages â€” all because the young women had dared to seek an education			1
so , just a few days before @entity19 , every single woman lawmaker in @entity9 signed letters urging president @entity21 to push the @entity22 to add @entity13 to the @entity23			1
it was a move rep. @entity25 , a @entity27 @entity26 , said would send " a strong message to the administration and the @entity22 " the sanctions would require all member nations to freeze the assets of those affiliated with @entity13 , an @entity34 militant group , and prevent travel through their borders			0
" we are mothers , sisters and daughters and we were all feeling helpless and wanted to do something , " said rep. @entity37 , a @entity39 @entity38			0
she worked across the aisle with @entity45 over the course of two days last week to get the 79 women in the @entity48 to sign the letter			1
" it 's not that we 're going to do this without men , but we are going to speak up and not be silenced , " @entity37 said			0
they were inspired by the example set earlier that week by sen. @entity55 , @entity26 of @entity56 , and sen. @entity57 , a @entity58 @entity38 , two veteran lawmakers who got the 20 women in their chamber to sign a similar letter			1
the message , the women said , was to give voice to the voiceless			1
and , as female lawmakers , they say their perspective lends a different take on this and other policy issues			1
" symbolically , it is very important that all the women in the @entity48 and @entity77 came together to get the @entity79 government to push the @entity80 on the sanction issue , " said @entity72 , director of the @entity73 at @entity74			1
" it 's hard to come up with a better mix to push this forward			0
it highlights issues that cut across party lines that affect women and girls			1
" we will not be silenced their election to @entity9 in 2012 , with a historic number of women elected to the @entity77 , made them the largest class of female lawmakers to ever walk the halls of @entity99			1
ever since then , the 99 women of the 113th @entity9 have pushed for changes that political experts say have had an impact both in terms of perception and policy on women and girls			1
the list of key initiatives is long			0
female lawmakers , such as @entity45 , have bills poised to come to the floor next week designed to end what the @entity113 estimates is the $ 9.5 billion human trafficking industry in the @entity79 and also are working on measures aimed at addressing campus sexual assaults			0
@entity57 sponsored a paycheck fairness measure in the @entity77 and when it was blocked last month by @entity26 , she lashed out at those who say women are " too emotional when we talk			1
" rep. @entity120 , a @entity121 @entity38 , and rep. @entity122 , a @entity123 @entity26 , have a measure that would create a bipartisan commission to study using private funds to create a @entity127 in @entity0			1
the women of the @entity129 recently pressured the @entity130 to re-examine grooming rules they felt were discriminatory to female troops of color			1
women in both chambers last year helped lead the fight to reauthorize the @entity137 and ensured that language expanded protections to immigrants , @entity139 , gays , lesbians , and transgender individuals			2
that same year , rep. @entity145 , @entity146 and more than a dozen other @entity147 put forth a @entity48 resolution asking @entity9 to recognize the disproportionate impact of climate change on women and children in poor nations			1
@entity147 sens. @entity154 of @entity121 and @entity155 of @entity27 worked for most of 2013 on competing measures to reform the process for prosecuting military sex assaults			0
though headlines tended to focus on fractures within the @entity77 women 's caucus over the two competing measures , the very fact that the two lawmakers were able to raise the profile of the issue is noteworthy , @entity72 said			2
political fight over military sex assaults divides women senators and it was the actions of women , in particular @entity173 and sen. @entity174 , @entity0 @entity38 , as a chief budget negotiator , that helped end last year 's government shutdown and helped craft a debt deal			2
breaking bread and stalemates @entity173 said she remembered sitting in her office one saturday watching @entity182 in disgust as lawmakers bickered over the details of a spending plan and whether that plan should , as some in the @entity26 wanted , defund or whittle away at @entity189			0
she pounded out a three - point plan to end the shutdown and went to the @entity77 floor to plead with fellow lawmakers to let go of partisanship and start negotiating			2
when she left the floor , her cell phone rang			0
it was sen. @entity197 , an @entity198 @entity26 , offering to help			0
when the phone rang again , it was sen. @entity201 , a @entity39 @entity26			0
part of that plan would help form the framework that ended the government shutdown			0
" there have been definite strides and we 're pleased at seeing progress , " said @entity206 , president of the @entity207 , a nonprofit group which seeks to improve female participation in politics			0
" when there are more women at the decision - making table there is a different perspective expressed			1
" at a gathering hosted by @entity77 women every six weeks , @entity57 has three rules : no staff , no press and no leaks			2
the get - togethers , which are often held at a lawmaker 's home , are a time for the women to bond outside of the halls of @entity9 and get to know one another on a personal level			1
recently , senator @entity232 , a @entity233 @entity38 , hosted the women			2
over on the @entity48 side , the women try to get to know each other on a personal level			2
" we 've got our softball team , the gym , we get together for dinner or a cocktail , " @entity45 said			0
" we talk about our families and who are as wives , daughters and mothers			0
you have to reach a humanity level to realize that end of the day we need to come together			0
" all of that bonding might have an effect on policy , according to research by the @entity255			0
" based on scoring all lawmaking activities in the @entity48 , women in the minority party are one third more effective than men in the minority party , " said @entity256 , a public policy and politics professor at the @entity255 who , along with his team , examined the sponsorship of bills from 1973 to 2008			1
@entity256 and his team of researchers have also found that female lawmakers tend to sponsor bills on broader range of policy areas than their male counterpart , and that the " women 's issue " areas tend to face more gridlock than the " ' men 's issue " areas			2
' no room for gridlock ' when it comes to the issue of helping rescue the kidnapped @entity11 schoolgirls , female lawmakers say there is no room for gridlock			1
" i knew the 20 women of the @entity77 , standing united and speaking in unison , were in a position to send a very powerful message , one that not only condemns this crime but that also helps spur action to bring these girls back home safely to their families , " @entity173 told @entity1 in a statement			2
and they will not take " no " for an answer			0
" we may make some additional calls to the @entity305 , " @entity45 said			0
" just to make sure they understand our position on this going forward			0

a historic number of women were elected to @entity9 in 2012
they spoke with one voice decrying the @entity11 schoolgirl kidnappings
their clout is being felt more frequently on *hot* - button issues
studies find women are more bipartisan , but get more done when in the minority party
