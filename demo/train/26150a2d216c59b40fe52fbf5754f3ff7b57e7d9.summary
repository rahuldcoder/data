@entity0 -- as a symbol of communication , refuge or romantic longing , the pay phone is an enduring cultural icon			1
witness @entity8 braving a downpour to call his girl in " @entity11 ... , " @entity12 under attack in @entity15 's " @entity14 " or @entity16 , that intrepid reporter , dashing into a phone booth to become @entity19			2
with the rise of mobile phones over the past decade , pay phones have been disappearing			1
@entity0 had a high of 35,000 pay phones in the late 1990s			1
today , there are only about 11,400 , according to the city			0
nationwide , the number of pay phones has dropped from approximately 2.1 million in 1999 to around 425,000 today			1
but thanks to some new initiatives , pay phones may not be doomed to fade from the urban landscape like penny - farthings and oil - lit street lamps			1
anyone with a cell phone knows that connectivity is not always guaranteed -- especially not during emergencies , when networks are overloaded			0
in the wake of @entity42 , which pounded the @entity44 in late october , many @entity0 found themselves without power and without mobile service			1
to communicate with the rest of the world , they took to pay phones			1
" i wanted to call my mom , but my cell phone was n't working			0
i remembered there were two pay phones on the corner of my street , " said @entity54 , 30 , who works in men 's fashion in @entity56 , and at the time , lived in the @entity57 where electricity and mobile phone service were knocked out by the storm			1
" i had n't really used a pay phone since i was 14 , before i got a cell phone			0
i did n't even know if they still worked , " she said			0
" my mom did n't even pick up ( at first ) when i called because she did n't recognize the number			0
" pay phone volume across @entity0 's five boroughs rose tenfold during @entity42 , said @entity71 of @entity72 , which operates 4,200 pay phones in the city			1
" pay phones are the last life line of communication for the poor in @entity81 , " said @entity75 , president of the @entity76			1
more than 750 million calls are placed on pay phones per year , he said			1
" there 's no question that pay phones are critical when there is an emergency , " @entity84 added			1
" we saw in @entity42 the same as @entity92			2
there were still pay phones working in @entity95 during the height of the storm when all other communication was out			1
" when all hell breaks loose , a pay phone is a good bet			0
but to stay relevant , the pay phone of the future needs to offer valuable services at all times , not just during emergencies			0
so the city of @entity0 is trying to give the humble pay phone an upgrade			2
in july the city created @entity112 hotspots at 10 payphone kiosks in three of its boroughs , the first step in a pilot program designed to make wireless access available to as many people as possible in the city			0
and this month mayor @entity120 announced a new initiative the city hopes will rejuvenate the city 's remaining public pay phones			1
the @entity125 dares students , technologists , designers , policy experts and urban planners , to come up with new solutions to take advantage of the existing pay phone framework and shape the future of public communications infrastructure			2
" we 're challenging our dynamic and ever - growing tech community to @entity138 ' and provide their ideas on what the future of payphones could entail , " said @entity120			0
several pilot programs in @entity0 already use existing payphone infrastructure , from digital advertising on phone kiosks in @entity148 to interactive touchscreens around @entity150			2
but the new contest hopes to create a new purpose for the pay phone			0
" what 's unique about the pay phone network in @entity0 is that the reliability of service is overwhelming -- and not just in hurricanes , " said @entity154 , citing the blackout of 2003 and the chaos of sept. 11 , 2001			2
@entity154 credits the " spider web " like network of copper wire , paired with coaxial and fiber crossing underneath city streets , for the network 's durability			2
" there 's no single ' choke point ' to disrupt the service , " he said			0
" it 's a matter of taking the existing infrastructure and making something new that people need			0
that copper wire is an old technology , but it still works			0

with the rise of mobile phones over the past decade , pay phones have been disappearing
but thanks to some new initiatives , pay phones may not fade from the landscape
in the wake of @entity42 , many @entity0 relied on pay phones
a new @entity0 initiative seeks to rejuvenate the city 's remaining public pay phones
