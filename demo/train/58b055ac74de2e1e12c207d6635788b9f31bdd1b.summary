-- at noon on may 16 , 1990 , a runaway truck struck a minibus at the foot of @entity4 and bound together the lives of 22 people : 18 @entity8 chasidim , two @entity9 , an @entity8 @entity10 and an @entity8 jew who had just found religion			1
the last died at the wheel of his bus			1
the rest of us returned to our homes to heal -- a medical jet flying me , my broken neck and a respirator back to @entity25			1
in time , half of my paralyzed body returned to life , my spastic left side not quite keeping up with my right			1
i was a hemiplegic and would be always			2
and when last year i returned to @entity4 at age 40 , stepping from the plane with my cane and ankle brace , i hoped to write of the crash and its place in my life			1
it had taken me years to tease out where i ended and my disability began			1
yes , i knew that had my neck not broken , i would have gotten a haircut that may day , would have played baseball in college , would have become a doctor			1
but what of the rest ? was it owing to the crash that i was not married , that i was ever - mindful of time , that people seemed to tell me what they told no one else ? i wondered if my crash - mates wondered similar things			1
i wondered how they had made sense of the crash			1
and so , 22 years after it , i set off to look for them			2
* * * i found the @entity61 first			2
they were a large extended family that , together with me and my @entity65 friend , had been riding the bus to @entity4 where they planned to worship at the @entity69 , the @entity69			2
i found them in the @entity72 town of @entity73			2
they welcomed me into their home			2
surrounded by seven shelves of holy books , @entity76 , the family patriarch , told me that @entity79 had caused the crash and spared our lives			1
he said we had to follow the example of job and serve @entity79 though we did not understand him			1
@entity85 : there are no scraps of men next , i found the widow of the bus driver			1
she was a secular jew of @entity92 descent and lived in the industrial town of @entity94			2
( she wished to keep her name private			2
) she told me that her husband had feared nothing but @entity79			1
and , she said , it was @entity79 who had ordained the crash			1
" it is written , " she told me			2
" if you do n't believe that , you will go crazy			2
" finally , in the @entity10 town of @entity104 , i found the driver whose truck had crashed into the left rear of the bus where i sat. @entity109 told me that he had become religious after the crash and that the crash was an act of @entity79			1
he then paused from his coffee and his @entity114 to speak an @entity116 word : @entity117			2
" i left @entity109 , mindful as i drove south toward @entity4 that , in this land of competing narratives , @entity10 and @entity121 were for once in perfect agreement			2
* * * @entity117 made a certain sense to me , for i had long wished to see the story of what befell me written down , formed into a coherent narrative			0
and so , years ago , i had settled on my own variant of maktoob : it will be written			1
now -- 23 years later -- it finally is			1
i have written my book			0
and it occurs to me that whenever any of us wish to assimilate why we suffer ( or prosper ) , we must choose between these same two narratives			0
we can attribute our lots to @entity79 and his writings , his unknowable ways			1
or we can root them in the natural world and chronicle them ourselves -- on paper or simply in our minds			0
we can take comfort in ultimate if inscrutable justice			0
or we can take comfort in observable reason and responsibility			0
* * * at first , i threw my lot in with @entity79			1
never mind that i had long struggled with the theological implications of life 's evident unfairness			1
i was being prayed for and i was recovering , and at age 19 , that sufficed			0
religion and maktoob were comforts -- the notion of divine authorship ( and its obvious extension , ultimate justice ) elastic enough to accommodate even inflexible facts like the @entity162 and that my mom was both good and burdened with a vascular disease			0
but in the end , whether one believes ( or not ) is not a choice			0
it is an empirical question			0
and in time , i came to see that i did not believe in a deity that choreographs crashes			0
i soon saw just as clearly the uncomfortable fact that i was agnostic regarding @entity79 ( though my love of @entity173 , its traditions and teachings , did not wane )			1
@entity117 -- reassuring , prescriptive -- was gone for good			0
@entity85 : my story -- from gangland daughter to star teacher but the need in me to make sense of things was not			0
like all of us , i still needed a narrative ! and as the years passed , and i failed to translate my thoughts into words on a page , i feared , as had @entity187 , " that i may cease to be before my pen has glean 'd my teeming brain			2
" * * * i write narratives for a living			0
and so , seated at my @entity4 window last year , ready to at last look back and write , i was familiar with the task at hand , the need to gather information and to then look for patterns in it			0
but as a writer , i also knew to be wary of pareidolia , the perception of a pattern or meaning where it does not exist			0
i knew that each of us is apt to overlook those patterns that do exist if they are inconvenient or painful			0
and i knew that particularly those narratives we write about ourselves can be as detached from the truth as those we inherit			0
and so , when written records -- hospital files , diaries , photos -- contradicted my memories , i deferred to them and tried to learn from the difference			0
that i misremembered that a girl in college had canceled our date after seeing my wheelchair a first time ( when in fact she had long known that i used it ) reminded me that i had long seen the shadow of disability where it was not present			0
and it was then i saw how similarly intent my crash - mates were to see @entity79 in a wrecked bus			1
@entity76 , the @entity229 , told me that @entity79 had saved his family because grandmother @entity231 had said @entity232 before boarding the bus			1
he did not note that the family had headed to @entity4 only because @entity235 had suggested they go to the @entity69 ( or that @entity79 might have done better by them by not causing the crash at all )			1
the widow of the slain bus driver said that @entity79 had taken her husband			1
she did not note that he had died at a bend in the highway known by some in @entity8 as " sivuv hamavet , " the turn of death , where between 1980 and 2010 , according to the @entity248 , there were 144 accidents with casualties			0
@entity109 , the truck driver , said that @entity79 , not he , had caused the crash ( adding that he had lived an unholy life before the crash , partying in @entity254 and @entity255 )			1
he did not note that he had ignored large yellow signs instructing him to shift his truck into a low gear ( evidenced by police photographs of his brake pads )			2
and he did not note that he had already been guilty , at age 25 , of 26 driving violations			0
but i noted these things			0
and what for so many years had seemed to point to the arbitrariness of life was soon evidence of the opposite -- my broken neck the almost inevitable consequence not of a divine plan , but of a reckless driver , a truck loaded with four tons of tiles , a backseat with no headrest , and a dangerous road			1
and it was out of this recognition that the narrative of a slim book grew , careful always to make sense , to reflect , to contextualize -- the obvious efforts of a once passive victim to exert agency over an ungovernable act			0
@entity85 : the why and how of effective altruism that agency is important for the writer			0
it is what enables him or her to wring meaning from facts and observations , and then be free of them			0
and because agency informs the narrative , it is important for the reader too			0
millennia after @entity302 suffered , my chasidic crash - mates put him forth to me as an example of faith in the face of sorrow			2
but he had ached to write his own narrative too			0
" oh that my words were now written ! " job said			0
" oh that they were printed in a book ! " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity315 .			1

23 years ago , a bus crash forever changed the life of @entity315
@entity315 's broken neck led to paralysis ; only half his body functions normally
he visited others affected by crash , learned that they accept it as @entity79 's will
@entity315 : i see the crash as result of a dangerous road and poor truck driver
