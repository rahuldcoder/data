a @entity6 fighter in the district of @entity8 , which is only 96 kilometers from @entity11			2
a @entity4 government official said friday that the insurgents had completely withdrawn from the district by the end of the week , but a human rights group said people in @entity8 were reporting that local @entity6 remained in the district			1
and senior @entity2 officials cautioned that any withdrawal by the @entity6 was likely meaningless and that the fundamentalist group now holds large areas of the country with the government seemingly unable to stop them			1
" we 're certainly moving closer to the tipping point , " adm. @entity28 , chairman of the @entity29 said on @entity31 's " today " show friday			0
in the interview from @entity34 , @entity28 said he was " extremely concerned " about indications the @entity6 is moving closer to @entity4 's capital of @entity11			1
@entity37 , commissioner of the @entity38 that includes @entity8 , said the @entity6 withdrew on friday without any conditions			2
earlier in the day , @entity6 spokesman @entity40 told @entity1 that the militants would pull back from the district			2
@entity4 @entity43 showed live footage of armed and masked @entity6 militants in @entity8 , loading pickup trucks and driving away			1
@entity48 , an @entity49 fundamentalist leader who has been negotiating on behalf of the @entity6 , was on scene overseeing the withdrawal , police said			2
@entity2 military commander gen. @entity52 credited about 300 @entity4 's @entity53 with driving @entity6 militants out of @entity8			1
the @entity56 chief spoke to @entity1 on friday after testifying before a @entity58 panel about the need for the @entity2 to boost its support for @entity4 counterinsurgency troops such as the @entity53			1
but @entity63 's regional chief said people in @entity8 are reporting a different situation			0
" what we 're hearing from people in @entity8 ... is that the @entity6 that have moved out are the non-local ones , " @entity66 , @entity63 's @entity67 director , told @entity1			2
" so the local branch of the @entity6 are still in place in @entity8			2
" @entity63 is concerned that those local @entity6 will continue to enforce the @entity6 's " abusive and repressive " control of @entity8			0
girls over the age of 7 are forced to wear a burka , a head - to - toe covering that the @entity6 say is required of @entity78 under its radical interpretation of @entity81 law , or sharia			0
" i think we 're going to see those harsh edicts stay , " @entity66 said			0
the @entity6 installed strict @entity81 law when it took over @entity34 after a two - year fight with warlords , many of whom surrendered without a fight			0
they fought with a coalition of some of those warlords known as the @entity96 from 1996 until @entity2 forces , seeking the leadership of @entity99 after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , added bombing raids to @entity96 ground operations and successfully drove the @entity6 out of most of @entity34			2
@entity103 : should the @entity2 intercede in @entity4 ? but the @entity6 regrouped in 2004 , launching a guerrilla war against the @entity34 government while operating from the tribal areas of that country and @entity4			1
meanwhile , senior @entity2 officials said that the " retreat " was likely meaningless			1
control was the impetus behind the @entity6 move into @entity8 , and the fundamentalist group now controls large areas of @entity4 , they said			1
the officials said , however , that they did not believe the @entity6 's goal was to take over the government of @entity4 but rather to create instability by taking advantage of @entity4 president @entity121 's apparent inability to cope with the situation			1
@entity121 , they said , does not understand the gravity of the situation , remains distracted by domestic politics and appears unable to make critical decisions to deploy the army to stabilize the country			0
@entity131 envoy @entity130 has been on the phone " nonstop " with officials in @entity11 and @entity0 , the officials said , providing frequent information to secretary of state @entity135 and president @entity136			0
@entity130 's read on the situation , officials familiar with the conversation said , is that the @entity4 government does not know how to handle the situation and is looking to the @entity2 for direction			1
a senior military official , however , presented a more dire case			1
@entity4 is " rapidly deteriorating , " he said			1
he said that he could not rule out the possibility of a military takeover in @entity11 , although he added that such a prospect was not in the immediate future			0
as for @entity4 's nuclear arsenal , he said the weapons " are safe for now " but that the @entity2 is monitoring the safety systems in place			2
administration officials said that the @entity4 military had assured the @entity2 it would not act without an express order from the civilian leadership			1
earlier this week , @entity158 warned that nuclear - armed @entity4 was in danger of falling into terrorist hands			0
before the @entity6 's apparent withdrawal friday , a local @entity4 official expressed doubt about whether the militants would leave , as they pledged to local elders on thursday			1
" nobody can trust them , " @entity166 , the provincial education minister , said by phone from @entity8			0
the @entity6 have broken promises before and probably would do so again , he said			0
militants who swarmed into @entity8 subsequently locked up courthouses , seized court documents and battled @entity4 troops who were sent to protect residents			0
the militants said they took control of the district to ensure that @entity81 law was properly imposed			0
the @entity4 government called the land grab a breach of a recent peace agreement			0
@entity1 's @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 contributed to this report .			0
