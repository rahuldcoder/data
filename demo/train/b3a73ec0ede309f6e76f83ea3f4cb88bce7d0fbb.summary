tests of an experimental @entity2 vaccine began this week at the @entity3 , amid mounting anxiety about the spread of the deadly virus in @entity7			1
on thursday , a third volunteer will receive a dose of the vaccine			1
the first volunteer , a 39 - year - old woman , received a dose tuesday ; the second volunteer , a 27 - year - old woman , received her dose wednesday			1
seven more will be given the vaccine next week			0
the @entity3 hopes to have 20 volunteers enrolled and vaccinated within three weeks			1
after an expedited review by the @entity19 , researchers were given the green light to begin what 's called a human safety trial , said dr. @entity23 , director of the @entity24 , or @entity24			1
it is the first test of this type of @entity2 vaccine in humans			1
the experimental vaccine , developed by the pharmaceutical company @entity30 and the @entity24 , is being given to the three healthy human volunteers at first to see if they suffer any adverse effects			1
if deemed safe , it will then be given to another small group of volunteers , ages 18 to 50 , to see if it produces a strong immune response to the virus			0
all will be monitored closely for side effects			0
the vaccine will be administered to volunteers by an injection in the deltoid muscle of their arm , first in a lower dose , then later in a higher dose after the safety of the vaccine has been determined			1
each volunteer is being paid approximately $ 1,700 for their time and inconvenience , the @entity3 said			1
the government agency expects to spend around $ 1.6 million on the trial overall			0
some of the preclinical studies that are normally done on these types of vaccines were waived by the @entity19 during the expedited review , @entity23 said , so " we want to take extra special care that we go slowly with the dosing			2
" the vaccine did extremely well in earlier trials with chimpanzees , @entity23 said			0
he noted that the method being used to prompt an immune response to @entity2 can not cause a healthy person to become infected with the virus			1
still , he said , " i have been fooled enough in my many years of experience ... you really ca n't predict what you will see ( in humans )			0
" the @entity3 says the vaccine will also be tested on healthy volunteers in the @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , once details are finalized with health officials in those countries			1
@entity82 director raises @entity2 alarm trials can not currently be done in the four countries affected by the recent outbreak -- @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 -- because the existing health care infrastructure would n't support them , @entity23 said			2
@entity76 and @entity77 were selected because the @entity3 has " long - standing collaborative relationships " with researchers in those countries			2
according to the @entity3 , officials from the @entity82 are also in talks with health officials from @entity90 about conducting part of the safety trial there			1
funding from an international consortium formed to fight @entity2 will enable @entity30 to begin manufacturing up to 10,000 additional doses of the vaccine while clinical trials are ongoing , the pharmaceutical company said in a statement			1
these doses will be made available if the @entity110 decides to allow emergency immunizations in high - risk communities			0
two candidate vaccines the @entity30 / @entity24 vaccine is one of two leading candidate vaccines			0
the other was developed by the @entity118 and licensed this month to @entity119 , a company based in @entity120			0
according to the @entity3 , safety trials of that vaccine will start this fall			1
ebola victim : ' i felt like i was about to die ' earlier this month , the @entity126 government shipped what it said was " 800 to 1,000 " doses of that vaccine to @entity89 , at the government 's request			2
it 's not clear whether it has been given to health workers or anyone else there			0
worth noting : in 2009 , an earlier version of the vaccine was given to a lab worker in @entity139 after he thought he had pricked himself with a needle tainted with @entity2			1
he did not develop the disease			0
while there is no proven treatment for @entity2 beyond supportive care , government agencies and small biotechnology firms have been scrambling to speed up development of several potential therapies and vaccines			2
a third vaccine , also developed by the @entity3 , was recently tested in primates and found to protect them from infection ; it was given in combination with @entity155 , an adjuvant that has been used with other vaccines and cancer therapies to boost the body 's immune response			1
drugs for treatment of @entity2 while vaccines might be given to prevent infection among health workers or other people thought to be at high risk , development has also been sped up on drugs that might be given to patients who already have the disease			2
the drug that 's received the most attention is @entity173 , which has been given to at least seven people in the current outbreak , including two @entity177 missionary medical workers , @entity178 and dr. @entity179			0
the drug has never been formally tested in humans , and while the results in human patients are encouraging -- five of the seven known to have received it are still alive -- experts say there is too little data to say whether it played a role in their recoveries			2
are myths making the @entity2 outbreak worse ? earlier versions of @entity173 , which received backing from the @entity177 and @entity126 governments as well as from biotechnology firms , have shown some ability to protect rhesus macaque monkeys more than two days after they were infected with the virus			2
the @entity177 @entity199 announced tuesday a $ 24.9 million , 18 - month contract with @entity173 's manufacturer , @entity202 , to accelerate the development of the medication			0
@entity206 will make " a small amount of the drug for early stage clinical safety studies and nonclinical studies " to gauge how the drug works on people , the @entity199 department said in a news release			0
the various new steps " will contribute to increasing the amount of product potentially available to treat patients with @entity2			2
" another drug , @entity220 's @entity2 , has been tested for safety in a small number of humans			1
that trial was put on hold in january , after one volunteer developed moderate gastrointestinal side effects after receiving a high dose of the medication			1
last month , the @entity19 modified the hold to a " partial clinical hold			2
" in effect , this means that @entity220 could be allowed to give the drug to doctors or hospitals that request it , on an emergency basis			0
there 's no indication that the company has received any such requests			0
the vaccine going into trials this week is based on an adenovirus -- a type of cold virus -- that 's found in chimpanzees			0
the virus delivers genetic material derived from two species of ebola virus , including the @entity254 strain that 's responsible for the current outbreak			0
those genes are meant to trigger the development of antibodies in the person who receives the vaccine , antibodies that can specifically defend against @entity2			1
another trial , using a version of the @entity30 / @entity24 vaccine that uses only the @entity254 strain of @entity2 , will be launched in october , the @entity3 said			1
all participants in the trial will be evaluated nine times over a 48 - week period			0
the @entity3 expects to reveal the results of the trial by the end of the year			1
if it 's approved for widespread use , the first priority will be to give the vaccine to health care workers or lab workers who are fighting the spread of the virus , @entity23 said			0
it will then be considered for people in the communities where outbreaks occur			0
nine things to know about the killer disease what happens when you survive @entity2 ?			0

a third volunteer will receive a dose of an @entity2 vaccine thursday
@entity19 approves the start of an ebola vaccine human safety trial
this is the first test of this type of @entity2 vaccine in humans
20 healthy volunteers will get the vaccine at the @entity3 in @entity302
