-- it was 1981 , and @entity2 was filming what she was told would be a half - live - action , half - cartoon for @entity6 on a completely black movie set			2
the director , @entity8 , came up to her and told her that she was going to be flying a " solar sailer " ship , and at another point , she would cross a bridge -- two things that she did n't see in front of her			2
" i asked him , ' what the hell is going on ? ' and he showed me these great @entity21 graphics , " @entity2 said			2
@entity21 , an industrial designer , was in charge of special effects for the movie , called " @entity25			1
" it would be the first time that an entire world was created with computer animation			1
twenty - eight years later , the movie , which cost a reported $ 17 million to make , has spawned a sequel , " @entity25 : legacy , " with a much larger budget			1
what is it about this movie -- considered a box office flop at the time ( it made $ 33 million , according to boxofficemojo.com ) -- that made fans at the 2008 @entity41 go wild to get a surprise look at " @entity43 " test footage ? interest has certainly remained high through the years			1
" wherever i would go in the world , no matter what language they spoke , the word ' @entity25 ' would come up , " said @entity46 , who played the character of @entity25 and returns in the sequel			1
" the computer culture was just starting up when we did ' @entity25			1
' there was no internet , " said @entity57 , star of both films			2
" i think [ the fans are ] guys who were raised on video games , and have a fondness for it			2
" you could certainly say that @entity66 has a fondness for the " @entity25 " video game			1
" anytime i went anywhere with a ' @entity25 ' arcade game , i was begging my parents for quarters , " he said			1
decades later , @entity66 owns an arcade console of his own , purchased at an auction			0
" it had been in a @entity76 for most of its life and had some nicks and scratches , " he said			0
" i 'm trying to restore the cabinet and get it as close as i can to making it look somewhat new			0
" and , of course , the movie has a special place in his heart			0
" this was the first movie inside of a video game , so something sparked the imagination and fascinated me			0
it 's probably still my favorite movie of all time despite how badly people reflect on it now , " he said			0
@entity66 theorizes that , " it was so different , and so ahead of its time that people just did n't get it			0
" most people even somewhat familiar with the original movie remember the suits worn by characters inside the computer			1
" the costumes were unbearable , there was no eating lunch in those things , " @entity2 said			0
even so , the original movie 's suits are a favorite among fans , no more so than @entity113 , who -- wearing the iconic suit -- gained fame online and on shows like " @entity117 " and " @entity118 " as " @entity119			1
" " what got me interested at the time the original came out was that i had just begun working as a mainframe systems programmer , " @entity113 said			1
" i had always been interested in computers			0
this was the first time anyone tried showing what went on inside a computer			1
" @entity113 is n't alone in being inspired by the movie in that way			2
at conventions , @entity2 said she constantly encounters fans who got into computer programming because of " @entity25			1
" fellow @entity134 @entity133 , a data processor at an insurance company at the time ( not unlike one of the computer programs in the movie ) , saw the movie on opening day , july 9 , 1982			2
" i left that theater , as one might say , rapt , " he said			0
" it had taken me to another place			0
" he noted how , with its use of terms like @entity152 , " rezzing , " and " end of line , " it was far ahead of its time			0
" it accurately predicted a future			0
we now have this thing called cyberspace			0
when you say that now , it resonates with people			0
" @entity133 also is a hard - core fan of all things @entity163			2
during a trip to @entity163 's @entity165 , he left a comment with a woman who worked there asking , " where 's ' @entity25 ? ' " according to @entity133 , she asked him , " was n't that a box office failure ? " @entity133 then pointed to an image from " @entity172 " -- which did n't make a profit until more than 25 years after its release -- saying , " that was , too			1
" with the imminent release of the sequel , fans have been clamoring for a blu - ray version of the original , which is quite difficult to find on @entity181 ( @entity183 's spokesperson said that the 2002 anniversary release is on " moratorium " )			2
according to @entity163 , earlier dvd releases are simply out of circulation and a blu - ray version that @entity8 is personally overseeing will be available early next year			0
" what i think @entity163 is doing is smart , " said @entity133 , who thinks it 's a good idea to re-establish " @entity25 " for a new generation			1
aside from the technological , early cyberpunk aspects of " @entity25 " and other themes ( @entity2 sees a spiritual component to it ; both films have something of a religious subtext ) , another explanation for its long - standing appeal is that the production design was unlike anything seen before			1
" the recognizers , those giant staple looking things , i thought those were crazy cool , " said @entity203			0
" i saw the new movie being promoted at @entity41 and i bought one of each of the recognizer toys there			0
i also got one for my son			0
the recognizer was by far the coolest			0
" @entity66 hopes that " @entity25 : @entity43 " will continue that tradition			1
" i hope the disc battles are as epic as everyone that 's already seen it is saying			0
" just before catching a sneak preview of the movie , @entity113 said , " everything that i 've seen about the new film has impressed me immensely			2
" no matter the reason , there 's just something about " @entity25			1
" as @entity2 put it , " technology was no longer something dull and dry , technology became magical			1
that 's the secret of ' @entity25			1

fan *anticipation* is high for " @entity25 : @entity43 "
computer programmers , gamers inspired by original film
original *co-star* says it made technology " magical "
