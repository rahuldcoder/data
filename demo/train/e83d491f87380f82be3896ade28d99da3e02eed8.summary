@entity0 , @entity1 -- we already knew that opponents of immigration reform had no good arguments in favor of preserving the status quo			1
now we know they have no shame			0
some of them are deliberately mixing apples and oranges and trying to use the tragedy of the @entity16 bombing to scuttle efforts in @entity18 to achieve immigration reform			1
all last week , my friends in the immigration reform community held their collective breath and hoped that -- when investigators finally zeroed in on a suspect in the @entity15 -- that person would not turn out to be foreign - born			1
immigrants are blamed for enough in society ; they need not be blamed for this tragedy			0
besides , from the perspective of the reformers , the timing could n't be worse			0
a few days after the bombing , the @entity37 's " gang of eight " unveiled what is the most significant piece of immigration reform legislation in more than a quarter century			1
the @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 of 2013 is an expertly crafted , bipartisan compromise that has a real shot at improving the lives of millions of people and fixing a broken system			1
yet , because of unrelated events , the legislation could wind up hanging by a thread			2
why ? because the prime suspects in the @entity52 bombing are immigrants : 19 - year - old @entity53 and his 26 - year - old brother , @entity54			1
the brothers are from the @entity57 @entity56 and moved to @entity58 at a young age before coming to the @entity60			0
@entity54 was killed thursday night in a shootout with police			0
@entity53 escaped and was at large friday until he was found in @entity63 , @entity64 , and apprehended by police			0
according to what two sources told @entity2 , @entity54 had been living in the @entity60 legally on a green card			2
@entity53 first came to the @entity60 as a tourist in the early 2000 's and later asked for asylum			0
he became a naturalized @entity60 citizen just last year , on september 11 , 2012			0
there 's that infamous date again			0
it 's worth noting that @entity60 started the long and difficult journey toward immigration reform on september 5 , 2001 , when president @entity77 welcomed @entity79 president @entity78 to the @entity80 for a state dinner in his honor			1
earlier in the day , both leaders told reporters that they wanted to fix the immigration system and match willing employers in the @entity60 with willing workers in @entity79			2
the reform was supposed to include a pathway to legal status for millions of illegal immigrants in the @entity60			2
six days later , our country was attacked and the world changed			0
immediately , immigration reform was put so far onto the back burner that it eventually fell clear off the stove			1
most supporters of immigration reform , including many @entity99 , believe that this was immensely unfair			1
the 19 hijackers were from the @entity102 , and they came to the @entity60 legally , many on student visas			2
so why would their evil acts have the effect of torpedoing the prospect of immigration reform that primarily affects millions of illegal immigrants from @entity108 ? now , here we are again			1
earlier this week , rep. @entity110 , @entity111 -- a vocal foe of immigration reform who has suggested the answer to securing the border is electrified fencing because , as he once said on the @entity80 floor , " we do this with livestock all the time " -- suggested that the congressional debate on the immigration bill should go slow because the suspects in the @entity52 bombing might turn out to be foreign nationals			1
that is just what happened			0
was that a lucky guess ? or is that how this guy 's mind works -- that every time something bad happens , an immigrant must be to blame ? on friday , @entity131 sen. @entity131 of @entity111 jumped into the fray during a hearing in the @entity134			0
" given the events of this week , it 's important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system , " he said			2
" how can we beef up security checks on people who wish to enter the @entity60 ? how do we ensure that people who wish to do us harm are not eligible for benefits under the immigration laws , including this new bill ? " also piling on was conservative columnist @entity148 , who has made clear over the last few months that she opposes immigration reform because she thinks it would lead to the " end of @entity108 " since @entity99 are busy " having illegitimate children and going on welfare			1
" she marked the shootout in @entity52 , and took a poke at the @entity156 senator who is leading immigration reform efforts , by mischievously tweeting : " it 's too bad @entity159 wo n't be able to be legalized by @entity160 , now			1
" again , the @entity54 brothers were immigrants , but they did n't need to be " legalized			0
" they were already in the country legally			2
but , hey , why let facts in the way of a good screed ? in response , a spokesman for @entity160 said in an e-mail to the @entity169 : " there are legitimate policy questions to ask and answer about what role our immigration system played , if any , in what happened			2
regardless of the circumstances in @entity52 , immigration reform that strengthens our borders and gives us a better accounting of who is in our country and why will improve our national security			1
americans will reject any attempt to tie the terrorists responsible for the attacks in @entity52 with the millions of decent , law - abiding immigrants currently living in the @entity60 and those hoping to immigrate here in the future			1
" let 's hope that 's right , and that most @entity60 do see these tactics for what they are : desperate attempts to thwart reform			2
here is the predicament that the nativists and right - wing demagogues find themselves in , whether they realize it or not			0
they want to opportunistically use the fact that bombing suspects were foreign nationals to once again derail immigration reform			1
but , in doing so , they walk away from the table and wind up defending the current immigration system			0
the @entity160 spokesman had it right			0
we have to know who is in this country , and what their intentions are -- whether they came legally or illegally			0
this is one of the things that immigration reform is about			1
no reform plan is perfect , but the status quo is flatly not acceptable			0
we have to keep the debate going			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			1

@entity224 : immigration reform *critics* are *wrongly* citing the @entity52 bombing
he says the suspects were here legally , their cases unrelated to larger issue
@entity224 : opponents will grab at anything to stop the immigration compromise bill
