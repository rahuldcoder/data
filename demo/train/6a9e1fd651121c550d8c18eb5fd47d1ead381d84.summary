-- in the face of several tough upcoming @entity5 races , many @entity2 candidates have found a multitude of ways to separate themselves from the president 's most recent speech on @entity10			1
@entity12 sen. @entity11 said he opposes arming @entity14 rebels			1
" we must have greater assurance that we are n't arming extremists who will eventually use the weapons against us , " he said			0
@entity11 has been working to distance himself from the president on a multitude of issues in a tight @entity5 race			2
5 takeaways from @entity25 's speech after the speech , @entity27 sen. @entity26 challenged the president 's suggestion that he has unilateral authority to expand military operations			1
he said @entity25 must receive authorization from @entity34 to do some of the things outlined in the speech			0
" i will not give this president -- or any other president -- a blank check to begin another land war in @entity42 , " @entity26 said in a statement			2
@entity26 's demand that @entity34 go on the record is contrary to conventional wisdom that campaigning lawmakers do n't want to go on record before a war - weary electorate weeks before an election			2

sen. @entity67 of @entity68 took an approach similar to @entity53 's			2
" i pressed the administration to arm and empower moderate @entity14 rebels and i am glad that effort will be accelerated			1
" @entity67 presented an image of someone who was standing up to the president , responding to attacks made by her challenger in an upcoming @entity5 race , @entity79 , who has argued that @entity67 is a puppet of @entity25			0
@entity79 said after @entity25 's speech : " the job of a senator is to stand up to the president when they are wrong , something sen. @entity67 has repeatedly refused to do			1
