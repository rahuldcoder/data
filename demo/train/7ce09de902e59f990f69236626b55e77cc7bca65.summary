-- remember when 50 seemed old ? ad agencies and tv networks wo n't freely admit to catering to the @entity4 set			2
fashion designers do n't typically pander to the grown - up in us			0
it 's tough to find someone 50 + on the cover of @entity11			1
and yet , for many women , 50 is the age when we reach our stride			2
it 's when we begin to love our maturing bodies			2
when we claim our personal style			0
when we step into our own power			0
so , what does the new 50 look like ? two words : @entity23			1
when you go through the endless scroll of photos of the first lady -- from @entity29 , when she first was cloaked in edgy designer @entity31 , to a recent state dinner honoring the @entity34 prime minister where she was wearing a sleek , off - the - shoulder dress from @entity39 design house @entity37 -- you see a fabulous and undeniable evolution			0
first lady at 50 : has big day changed ? @entity23 has the nerve to look younger , fitter , and more comfortable in her skin than she did seven years ago			1
how she does it is an inspiration to all of us over 50			2
if a picture tells anything , it says she is poised to take on whatever comes her way with grace , dignity , humor , warmth and level - headedness			2
while she has come to be known both for her cut arms and her healthy manifesto to young people , " @entity56 , " what remains curious about this 5 - foot - 11 brown - skinned woman with decidedly black features ( who could easily have been considered awkward ) is that she has become a fashion icon			0
think about it : how many women in television news and in corporate offices across the country had what the president affectionately called " the right to bare arms " before @entity23 started sporting her long , lean limbs ? those sleeveless dresses got women pumping iron , too , urging them on with the dream that they , too , could look as good as she one day			1
@entity80 has surely driven people to better health ! @entity23 -- much like her predecessor @entity83 -- has taken the global stage by storm , choosing to define a style for herself that defies tradition			1
the cut arms ? check			0
the return of the bangs ? check			0
the popularizing of affordable @entity39 fashion ? check			0
10 reasons to welcome turning 50 and why not ? all eyes were on @entity23 from the moment she walked into the @entity96			1
what would the first black first lady do to make her mark ? how would she present herself ? what would be her defining moments ? @entity23 has introduced the country and beyond to a woman who is unafraid to be herself , who embraces her uniqueness , and who strategically says what she thinks			1
saying it through her attire was a clever way to open many doors			0
she sold out a @entity112 dress from @entity113 when she made an early appearance on " @entity115 , " showing you do n't have to break the bank to look good			1
she dazzled viewers in @entity34 - @entity121 designer @entity120 's crazy mixed - up patterns while exercising with children on " @entity123			2
" when she took off a shiny black leather jacket to do 25 pushups ( three more than @entity127 on her own show ) , folks stopped checking so much for who she was wearing and instead took a good look at what she was saying			2
had @entity23 come out on the national stage wearing a frown , pounding her fists , saying we have to get healthy and move our bodies or we are going to die , it 's unlikely that her cause would have been met with as much success			1
instead , she has made looking and feeling good hip , even fashionable			1
for her , 50 is n't about @entity141 or any other fat - cloaking accessory			0
when you are at your fighting weight and probably look amazing in a two - piece , why would you ? for this first lady — whose agenda secretly looks more like that of @entity150 , who stood up for women and intelligence in the face of hostility and scorn — engaging in the art of adornment to expand the lens of how people look at each other and their world has been nothing short of brilliant			0
in 2008 , @entity39 took a bet on a president and first lady who did n't remotely resemble their predecessors			0
thank goodness , @entity23 did n't choose a predictable , cookie - cutter approach once she moved into @entity170			1
she took a fashion road less traveled , walking away from heavyweights like @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 and choosing to give some newbies and / or smaller houses a chance			0
she gave @entity179 a meteoric jump - start with her first inaugural gown , broadened black female designer @entity183 's reach with a sunny @entity185 cover and has championed a whole host of other creators — @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 — many who got the kind of shine they had n't dared dream about before her reign			0
why does this matter ? @entity23 has artfully navigated her time in office to elevate the collective consciousness about diversity , health and fitness			1
she 's faced the wrath of critics , who have picked on her for everything from her passion to get the nation 's youth into exercise to her amazing posterior to the sneakers she wore while volunteering at a food bank			0
still , at 50 , she stands poised ( often in @entity215 ) as a perfect example of what being grown and vital looks like			1
who would n't want to look as good as @entity23 when crossing the halfway mark of life ? to the haters out there , take a look in the mirror and ask yourself if you 'd stand up in her shoes ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			1

@entity233 : what does the new 50 look like ? two words : @entity23
@entity23 's look says she 's poised to take on whatever comes her way , @entity233 says
@entity233 : @entity23 has made looking and feeling good hip , even fashionable
