for three weeks now , @entity0 and @entity1 have been locked in a deadly battle			1
each side points to the other for provoking the conflict , which has left scores -- mainly civilians -- dead			0
and yet , a cease - fire seems unlikely , in part because the sides do n't feel they have accomplished their goals			0
what are the goals for @entity0 , the organization that governs @entity14 and is considered a terrorist organization by many @entity17 powers ? and what is it willing to settle for to end the bloodshed ? what @entity0 wants : 1			1
this mission is written into the preamble of @entity0 ' founding document : " @entity1 will exist and will continue to exist until @entity26 will obliterate it			1
" it 's a demand that is globally repudiated as outrageous			2
it is unrealistic for @entity0 to think that it can somehow destroy @entity1			1
as long as @entity0 leaders latch on to that as an endgame , the result will be continued flare - ups for years to come			2
some @entity0 leaders have stated a willingness to accept peace with @entity1 under certain conditions , the @entity35 notes in a report			1
for instance , they want @entity43 refugees to be able to return			0
but such voices are not being heard in the current conflict			0
if @entity0 is incapable of destroying @entity1 , it might still be dedicated to scaring @entity1 off the contested land , journalist @entity48 at the @entity49 posits			1
" the goal of @entity0 — the actual , overarching goal — is to terrorize the @entity52 of @entity1 , through mass murder , into abandoning their country , " @entity48 wrote			1
" if generations of @entity43 have to be sacrificed to that goal , well , @entity0 believes such sacrifices are theologically justified			2
" @entity60 @entity59 analyst @entity58 , a former @entity1 ambassador to the @entity61 , suggests a different type of war -- a media campaign by @entity0			1
" @entity0 knows it ca n't destroy @entity1 with its rockets or tunnels , but it can create a legal and international situation where @entity1 can no longer legitimately defend itself , " he said			1
reports of civilian casualties in @entity14 -- without the context of rockets being fired at @entity1 -- play into @entity0 ' media strategy , he said			1
an end to the @entity1 blockade			1
although @entity1 withdrew its forces from @entity14 in 2005 and dismantled @entity1 settlements , @entity43 say they continue to live under occupation to this day			1
@entity43 argue that @entity1 still maintains effective control of @entity14 , making it an occupied territory			1
@entity1 controls @entity14 's borders , waters and airspace -- and oversees what goods make it into the territory			1
@entity60 's @entity85 recently spoke with @entity86 , who is essentially the prime minister of @entity14			2
the @entity0 member gave his demands -- namely , an immediate end to what he called the @entity1 aggression			1
he wants border crossings to @entity1 and @entity93 opened			2
in a 2012 interview with @entity60 , @entity0 leader @entity94 had a similar message			2
" the resistance is a means to an end , " @entity94 told @entity60 's @entity97			0
" the endgame is to end occupation but the international community is not enabling us to do this			0
they are biased towards @entity1			2
" @entity0 wants a cease - fire , @entity0 spokesman @entity106 said of the current conflict , but it wants assurances that the @entity43 will be able to live peacefully			2
" no one is talking against having a cease - fire			0
but we want a fair cease - fire to protect our own people for a long time , to protect them from the @entity1 military attacks , from the siege , from the arrests , " @entity106 told @entity60 's @entity112			2
in 2011 , a captured @entity1 soldier , @entity120 , was released by @entity0 in exchange for more than a thousand @entity43 prisoners held in @entity1			1
many have since been re-arrested			0
dozens of other @entity43 were arrested in the aftermath of the june 12 kidnapping of three @entity1 teenagers , an incident which precipitated the current fighting			0
there is a precedent of @entity43 prisoners being released in negotiations with @entity0			0
this demand by @entity0 is also among the most straightforward it has presented			0
" @entity1 is not respecting its commitment by releasing and then arresting prisoners released , " said @entity135 , a leading @entity136 journalist and political editor of @entity138			0
" it 's a sign that @entity1 has not respected its commitment			0
" the conditions that @entity0 is making is not something unjustified , he told @entity60			0
" they have a right to make a request because they 've been under siege			0
some analysts argue that @entity0 is engaged in a battle with @entity1 to shore up support among @entity43			1
many @entity43 believe that @entity1 has no intention of finding long - term peace , and they are likely to support @entity0 in greater numbers if they view the militants as standing up for their rights			1
" @entity0 gains strength from the feeling of many @entity43 of despair that they see settlement growth			0
they do n't believe that @entity1 has any intention of giving them a state of their own			0
and so when @entity0 says what good is there for us to accept @entity1 's right to exist since @entity1 will never give us a state anyway , that makes @entity0 stronger , " @entity60 political commentator @entity170 said			1
during the last prolonged outbreak between the two sides in 2012 , many concluded that @entity0 gained credibility at the expense of other @entity43 leadership factions , according to a @entity35 report			0
in the period since 2012 , @entity0 has seen the number of governments friendly to it diminish , and its influence wane			1
" @entity0 finds itself in a very difficult situation , and has for a couple years now , " writes @entity187 , a fellow at @entity188 for @entity189			0
" since 2012 , when @entity93 was governed by a president from the @entity192 ( @entity0 ' parent organization ) , @entity0 ' fortunes have declined precipitously			0
" strapped for cash and possibly losing popularity , @entity0 operatives may have decided that they had little to lose in entering a conflict			0
it 's possible , @entity187 said , that @entity0 militants may not always be under the control of its political wing , and that this current conflict is the result of @entity0 losing control of its cadres .			2

@entity0 has a number of stated goals
some , like the destruction of @entity1 , are repudiated globally
@entity0 also wants an end to @entity1 control in @entity14
