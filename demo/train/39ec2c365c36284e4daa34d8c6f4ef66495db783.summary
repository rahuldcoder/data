-- a state trial judge on monday blocked @entity3 's plan for a maximum 16 ounce size for a high - sugar beverage			1
the ban would have included sodas , energy drinks , fruit drinks and sweetened teas			2
but it would have excluded alcoholic beverages and drinks that are more than 50 % milk , such as lattes			2
the ban would have applied to restaurants , movie theaters , stadiums and mobile food carts			0
but it would not have applied to supermarkets and convenience stores , such as @entity23			0
mayor @entity25 's proposal was met with fierce opposition by the industry and public outrage at the loss of " liberty , " the so - called " nanny state " run amok			1
beyond all the hype , the industry 's vociferous arguments , now adopted by a trial court , are badly flawed			1
in fact , the @entity36 has the power , indeed the responsibility , to regulate sugary drinks for the sake of city residents , particularly the poor			1
news : @entity45 governor reviews ' @entity47 ' bill would the ban work ? nearly six out of 10 @entity3 residents are overweight or obese , as are nearly four out of 10 schoolchildren			1
this can not be acceptable to our society , knowing that obesity is such a powerful risk factor for diabetes , cancer and heart disease			2
no one would disagree that government should act , but how ? there is no single solution , but many ideas that would work in combination			2
one of those solutions is to control portion size and sugar consumption			1
why ? first , the ever - expanding portions ( think " supersized " ) are one of the major causes of obesity			2
when portion sizes are smaller , individuals eat less but feel full			0
this works , even if a person can take an additional portion			0
( most wo n't because they are satiated , and it at least makes them think about what they are consuming			0
) second , sugar is high in calories , promotes fat storage in the body and is addictive , so people want more			0
the so - called " war on sugar " is not a culture war , it is a public health imperative backed by science			0
opposing view : ' @entity47 ' bill stops overregulation so , there is good reason to believe @entity3 's portion control would work			1
but why does the city have to prove that it works beyond any doubt ? those who cry " nanny state " in response to almost any modern public health measure ( think food , alcohol , firearms , distracted driving ) demand a standard of proof that lawmakers do n't have to meet in any other field			1
when a law is passed to increase jobs , spur the economy or subsidize a corporate sector ( oil , for example ) , we do n't insist that lawmakers prove it works			0
at least public health officials rely on science and try to craft rules that have a chance of workingâ € ” if not in isolation , then in combination with other obesity control measures such as food labeling , calorie disclosures , trans fat restrictions and access to affordable fruits and vegetables in schools and poor neighborhoods			1
is the ban consistent ? the industry stoked the fires of public discontent with its campaign against the " inconsistencies " in the soda ban			1
why does n't the ban apply to milky drinks , why can @entity23 sell large sugary drinks , and why not ban refills ? justice @entity146 bought both industry arguments : it wo n't work and it is inconsistent			1
he went so far as to call the ban " fraught with arbitrary and capricious consequences " and filled with loopholes			0
again , we find a double standard			0
@entity25 did what every other politician does : balance public health and safety with realpolitik			0
consider one of the judge 's major arguments : balancing public health and economic considerations is " impermissible			1
" this judicial reasoning makes no sense			0
if policy makers could not balance economic consequences , virtually every law in @entity171 would be flawed			0
there is another huge problem with this argument			0
it assumes that unless public health does everything , it can do nothing			0
the whole art of politics is compromise			0
the mayor gets a lot of what he seeks to fight obesity , but not everything			2
does the @entity36 have the power ? admittedly , the soda ban would have been better coming from the city 's elected legislature , the @entity188			1
but the @entity36 has authority to act in cases where there is an imminent threat to health			2
does n't the epidemic of obesity count as an imminent threat , with its devastating impact on health , quality of life and mortality ? in any event , the @entity36 has authority over the food supply and chronic disease , which is exactly what it has used in this case			1
members of the @entity36 , moreover , are experts in public health , entitled to a degree of deference			2
the fact that the proposal originated in the mayor 's office does not diminish the board 's authority and duty to protect the public 's health			0
many health proposals arise from the executive branch , notably the @entity222			0
should industry have an outsized influence on public health policy ? the fingerprints of the food and restaurant industries , with their clear economic conflicts of interest , are all over the public and judicial campaign to block the soda ban			2
@entity233 undertook a multimillion - dollar campaign , flying banners over the city and plastering ads over the subways			0
they immediately filed suit and hired the most elite law firms			0
rather than recognize the public health effects of large sugary drinks , they chose to fight , reminiscent of @entity245			1
what is worse , the public ( and now a judge ) fell for the industry 's manipulations			1
most @entity3 oppose the portion ban , while politicians in other states are scrambling to show their disapproval			1
@entity45 is about to pass a law forbidding portion control			1
imagine that in a state with the highest obesity rate in @entity171 ! we are used to fierce lobbying for personal gain in @entity171 , but that does n't mean we should be duped by industry propaganda			1
is a portion limit really such an assault on freedom ? it does n't stop anyone from buying soda			1
if consumers really want , they can buy several smaller drinks			2
it does n't stop companies from giving refills			0
there is really no great burden posed on individuals , only a little nudge in the right direction			0
at the same time , it could make meaningful changes in the drinking habits of @entity3			2
why is the industry fighting this so fiercely ? because when it is shown to be successful in @entity3 , it will be emulated in major cities in @entity171 and worldwide			1
is n't that exactly what we need to stem the tide of obesity ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity295 .			1

a @entity3 state judge blocks the city 's plan to limit the size of sugary drinks
@entity303 : a portion limit is not an attack on freedom ; people can still buy soda
he says like @entity245 , industry has spent millions to fight this effort to combat obesity
@entity295 : the @entity36 has the power to regulate sugary drinks ; portion control can work
