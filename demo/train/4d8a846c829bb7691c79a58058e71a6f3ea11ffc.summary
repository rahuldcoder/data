@entity35 : reports of a @entity2 apology to @entity3 are false the subject of military raids and strikes has long been a sore point between the two countries , especially given a number of incidents in which noncombatant men , women and children were killed			0
the proposed deal contains references to respecting " @entity3 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , " and adds @entity2 forces " shall not target @entity3 civilians , including in their homes			1
" but this agreement does not address past transgressions			0
in fact , @entity11 strongly rejected a @entity2 apology for operations that resulted in civilian casualties was part of the back - and - forth , as some published reports suggested , insisting " it 's just not even on the table			2
" " i do n't know where the idea of an apology started , " @entity11 said			0
" president @entity14 did n't ask for an apology			0
... there has never been a discussion of or the word apology used in our discussions whatsoever			0

since taking office , president @entity122 has promised -- and , in some cases , acted -- to reduce troop levels there , in addition to stating the goal of ending the @entity2 combat mission by the end of 2014			0
the approval of a security agreement would pave the way for @entity2 troops to remain on the ground in @entity3 beyond that			2
speaking on wednesday , @entity138 spokesman @entity137 stressed that any @entity2 forces would have " a very limited mission " and would not be " patrolling cities or mountains			2

" the combat mission will be over			0
" @entity11 used similar language in calling the @entity2 military 's role in @entity3 " very limited , " adding " it is entirely ( to ) train , equip and assist " @entity3 forces			1
the language in the proposed security agreement , in fact , speaks to that point : " unless otherwise mutually agreed , the @entity2 forces shall not conduct combat operations in @entity3			1
