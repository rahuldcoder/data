@entity0 -- famed for his rugged , immense portraits of the @entity4 , @entity2 regularly tops lists of the 20th century 's greatest nature photographers			1
@entity2 has won countless awards , including the highest @entity9 civilian honor , the @entity10			1
in his home country , he is one of the few photographers to have become a household name , following a 50 - year career in which he captured some of the most iconic images of @entity17 and the country 's immense mountain ranges			0
today , he is rarely the subject of the intense , approving attention he once was during his lifetime -- his endlessly reproduced photographs appearing to have lost the ability to enrapture and surprise viewers			0
an exhibition at the @entity28 's @entity27 in @entity0 plans to wash away viewer 's apathy			1
@entity31 , the museum 's touring exhibitions manager , aims to re-energize engagement with @entity2 ' photographs by drawing attention to the life imparted into his images by the irrepressible movement of water			1
the exhibition -- subtitled " photography from the @entity42 " -- is showing over 100 prints from the artist			1
" @entity2 was a coastal boy and the interest in the sea , and water more generally , permeated his entire career , " says @entity31			2
" by concentrating on that as a theme for the exhibition , we felt it was a challenge in a way to the image of @entity2 that has been passed down as a rather conservative photographer -- and we tried to draw out from the archives an alternative history of him as an artist			1
" as an avid explorer of @entity64 's @entity63 coast , water reappears in all its forms through @entity2 ' body of work			1
refocusing the viewer 's attention on the running rivers , cloud , snow and ice in the images on display allowed @entity31 to combine lesser - known photographs with @entity2 ' most celebrated works , she says			1
" for us , what we really wanted to do was give a sense of the trajectory of his career -- how he 's come to be known , which is by his photography of the mountains specifically -- and then to say : we 're moving on from that			0
" " it 's a subject that allowed ( @entity2 ) to play , which is why you get a huge variety			1
" born in a suburb of coastal @entity93 in 1902 , @entity2 was the only child of a family who found wealth in the logging and freight trades and , soon after , lost it in the stock market panic of 1907			2
@entity2 experimented with a " pictorialist " style in his youth , producing some rarely - displayed photographs where he applied soft focus and hand - manipulated negatives to replicate the style of a landscape painter			2
but it was his later photographs , featuring meticulous composition and striking pinpoint clarity , for which @entity2 , who died in 1984 , became famous			1
the art critic @entity110 , a contemporary of @entity2 , described the " extreme depth of focus and extreme rendition of textures " that characterized his photographs			2
she tells how he was fascinated with the camera as a tool to both stop time at a precise moment and defy the capabilities of the human eye , bringing great spans of distance into sharp focus and creating exaggeratedly high - contrast black and white frames			0
the @entity27 's exhibition explores how @entity2 ' depiction of water changes as he developed from the pictorialism 's impressionistic style to forge the crisp modernism for which he is now know			1
@entity31 describes how vast movements of water -- frozen in time by @entity2 ' trademark razor - sharp shooting -- bring life to one of the most well - worn images on display in the exhibition			2
@entity2 ' " @entity148 " is a grandiose view of a @entity144 rock face capped by snow , obscured by parting cloud and penetrated by a rushing waterfall			0
" it includes water in all its forms and speaks to the ideas of a fleeting moment -- the sort of ephemeral moment			0
it is a clearing storm , so that suggests a before and after and a sort of narrative within the picture , " @entity31 says			0
" it 's also a picture which i think looks very muscular and very solid and very geological			0
it kind of concentrates on these rocky forms , but actually it 's animated by a waterfall and by the dusting of snow and ice across the foreground			0
" while many visitors will continue to greet such images with awe , the criticism -- which the curator hopes to confront -- is also nothing new			0
during the @entity177 of the 1930s , his human - free landscapes drew scorn for romanticizing a " wilderness " that was already colonized by tourism and for cropping out man 's influence			0
during this time , prominent @entity186 photojournalist @entity185 complained : " the world is going to pieces , and people like @entity2 ... are photographing rocks ! " in 1952 , @entity2 co-founded 5 associates , a postcard printing company which today offers lithographic posters , seasonal greetings cards and month - by - month calendars bearing @entity2 ' images -- all of which have contributed to the ubiquity of his work			2
@entity31 hopes a splash of water can flush out some of the best - loved qualities of his work and counter the perception of @entity2 as a capturer of lifeless landscapes			1
" the idea of the shifting landscape is really important : that this was something which is always developing and changing , it 's not something which is static and monumental			0
" the exhibition runs until april 28 2013 .			0
