-- the number of women dying in pregnancy and childbirth has dropped by a third in the past two decades , according to a report out wednesday from four world bodies including @entity7 and the @entity8			1
the report says the number has decreased by 34 percent , from an estimated 546,000 in 1990 to 358,000 in 2008			1
" the global reduction in maternal death rates is encouraging news , " said @entity8 director - general @entity11			1
while the progress is notable , the rate of decline is still less than half of what is needed to achieve the @entity21 of a 75 - percent reduction by 2015 , the report said			1
that would require an annual decline of 5.5 percent , whereas the 34 - percent drop represents an annual decline of 2.3 percent			0
the reason for the decline in deaths is that countries with greater risks during pregnancy and childbirth are taking more effective measures , such as training more midwives and strengthening hospitals and health centers to assist pregnant women , @entity27 said			2
" no woman should die due to inadequate access to family planning and to pregnancy and delivery care , " she said			0
there are four major causes of death for pregnant women , according to the report : severe bleeding after childbirth , infections , hypertensive disorders , and unsafe abortion			2
those four reasons caused 1,000 women to die in 2008			0
more than half of those deaths happened in @entity58 , and a third happened in @entity59			0
women in developing countries are 36 times more at risk of dying from a pregnancy - related complication than a woman in a developed country , the report said			0
" to achieve our global goal of improving maternal health and to save women 's lives , we need to do more to reach those who are most at risk , " said @entity7 executive director @entity68			2
" that means reaching women in rural areas and poorer households , women from ethnic minorities and indigenous groups , and women living with @entity84 and in conflict zones			0
" @entity7 and the @entity8 issued the report together with the @entity87 and the @entity88 .			1

deaths have gone from 546,000 in 1990 to 358,000 in 2008
