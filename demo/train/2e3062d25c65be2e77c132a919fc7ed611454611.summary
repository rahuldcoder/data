-- as @entity2 prepares to host all - out golfing war in the form of the @entity5 , there is more reason than you might think to remember the city 's most infamous son			2
" scarface " @entity10 was not a man to be in competition with			1
the murderous mob boss ruled @entity2 to the rattling sound of heavy machine - gun fire in the 1920s and took out anybody -- make that pretty much everybody - who stood in his way			2
but it was not all bootlegging and brutality for the life of @entity24			1
photos : @entity27 gangsters away from the bloody battles of prohibition - era @entity27 , it turns out he loved nothing more than a good walk spoiled and target practice of a very different kind			2
as unlikely as it seems , the gangster was a golf nut			1
" @entity10 was an avid golfer , " @entity39 , academic and author of the @entity41 : images of @entity27 , told @entity0			1
" some of the guys around him were , too			2
" the hoods loved sports			0
@entity24 and a few others managed some fighters , and they went to baseball games together a lot , too			1
" @entity24 liked golf , but that is not to say he was very good at it			1
" at first , he seldom broke 60 for nine holes ; he eventually elevated to 18 holes though there is no evidence he was anything but a hacker on the golf course , " wrote @entity55 in @entity10 : the biography			1
@entity55 continued : " his rounds were devoted to having fun with his gangster friends who drank plenty each hole , gambled recklessly on the stroke of a ball and carried loaded weapons in their golf bags for use in emergences			1
" @entity5 revolutionaries : @entity76 and @entity77 during his 1920s heyday , @entity24 was a regular at @entity80 golf course - a facility 20 miles south of @entity2 that is still in operation today , though @entity24 's memory has long since been erased			1
it was there he hosted regular games with his associates and acquired the services of a wide - eyed , eight - year - old caddie named @entity91			2
in a 1972 article for @entity93 , @entity91 recalled his first round on the bag for @entity24			1
the stakes were $ 500 a hole and @entity24 was partnered with " @entity98 " @entity99 in a foursomes match against @entity101 and @entity102			1
@entity99 and @entity103 were both implicated in the 1929 @entity104 -- the gangland hit on his mob rivals that made @entity24 a household name			1
neither faced charges , but @entity99 -- a talented golfer -- was assassinated almost exactly seven years later in a suspected revenge attack			0
@entity103 was convicted of the murder of a policeman in 1931 and died of a heart attack in prison			2
@entity115 was the @entity2 mob 's lawyer of choice			0
you might call them the original ' group of death '			0
and there were we thinking @entity126 's @entity124 and @entity125 were a frightening pairing to come up against			0
" @entity24 teed off first , " said @entity91			1
" he fetched the ball a whack that would have sent it clear down the fairway , only he hooked it and it curved way off to the left into a clump of trees			2
" i scrambled around on all fours for about 10 minutes trying to find it , scared to death @entity138 would lose his temper and hit me or maybe shoot me , but all he did was grin , pat me on the head and call me kid			0
' it 's @entity143 , @entity144 , so we lose a stroke , that 's all			0
just gim me another ball			2
' and i thought : ' he ca n't be as mean and rough as he 's cracked up to be			0
' " @entity91 paints a picture of wild , booze - fuelled matches where cheats prospered and arguments frequently spilled over into violence			0
there was the time @entity24 accidentally shot himself in the foot by setting off a revolver in his golf bag as he rummaged for a club			1
and the time @entity115 , maddened by his inability to escape a bunker , ran after @entity91 wielding his driver and ready to use it			0
this was golf the way gangsters play it , with etiquette very much afterthought			1
" there was a crazy game called @entity174 , " @entity91 wrote			0
" one guy would stretch out flat on his back , shut his eyes tight , and let the others tee off from his chin			2
they used a putter and swung slow and careful			0
otherwise they would have smashed the guy 's face			0
on the putting greens they 'd throw down their pistol holders -- clunk - and hold a wrestling match			0
" taking the first tee on day one of the @entity5 suddenly does not seem such a nerve - wracking proposition after all			0
@entity191 wo n't be armed and we wo n't see @entity193 swigging whisky and ready to beat his caddie over the head with a hybrid ( at least we hope not )			0
there will be bodyguards , though , especially surrounding @entity200			0
@entity124 to hunt down @entity201 at @entity202 ? but to disregard @entity24 's golfing exploits as drunken folly is to do his infatuation with the sport a disservice			1
according to a new book written by the mobster 's niece , @entity24 , her uncle was so hooked he escaped under a false name and made a golf pilgrimage to @entity214 during the height of his reign -- traveling with a caddy who doubled as his bodyguard and buying a handmade set of clubs , which he had engraved with his initials			1
" he was in love with the game and with @entity214 , '' mrs. @entity24 told the @entity223 newspaper			1
'' i remember seeing his bag of clubs in the house in @entity230			0
he told me they 'd been made for him in @entity214			1
'' @entity24 , with his crime syndicate bringing in an estimated $ 100 million a year at the peak of its operation , had no problems funding his habit according to @entity239 , author of the @entity241 world : a journey into the @entity241 , @entity24 's @entity2 outfit saw golf as yet another avenue for making money			1
most people paid to play , but -- as with everything with @entity24 -- golf found a way of paying him			1
" every city had gangsters but the country clubs were built and financed by the social elite and gangsters were not allowed near , " @entity252 told the @entity253 in 2009			0
" but @entity2 was a unique set - up			0
@entity10 and his gang ran the golf clubs in @entity2			1
there , mobsters like @entity24 , drew protection money from the country clubs and they had access to the golf courses			1
" @entity268 has yet to find evidence @entity24 used golf to make money			1
he does accept , though , that criminal activity was likely in the planning on the fairways			0
" @entity276 was a pastime for them ( the @entity2 outfit ) , " he told @entity0			0
" it was n't until the 1950s and 60s that the mob in @entity2 started controlling golf clubs			2
but if they 're on the course and nobody 's around , they 're talking business			0
many normal people in the business world use golf that way			2
" the one thing @entity24 could not control was his game			1
he died in 1947 , aged 48 , and having never mastered how to hit a straight drive or sink a putt			2
there is just not a racket to get you from tee to green , it seems , which goes to show there really are some things in life that money can not buy			0
if he was still with us there is no doubt @entity24 would have scored @entity310 passes for his golfing buddies			2
watching on with cigars in mouth , hipflasks in hand and guns at the ready , the @entity2 outfit would have been in their element at @entity319			0
they would , quite literally , have owned the place .			0

infamous gangster @entity10 and his associates were keen golfers
@entity326 eed off by hitting the ball off the chin of an associate
@entity24 traveled under a false name to play golf in @entity214
he died at the age of 48 from *cardiac* arrest
