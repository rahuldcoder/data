-- @entity1 knows what it takes to win football 's greatest prize -- and the former @entity7 star believes @entity8 is close to claiming a historic first @entity10 title			1
only three teams from the continent have ever reached the quarterfinal stage of the tournament -- @entity15 in 1990 , @entity16 in 2002 and @entity17 in 2010 -- yet none have made it to the last four			1
despite high expectations , first sparked by @entity23 's prediction in 1977 that " an @entity25 nation will win the @entity10 before the year 2000 , " there have been a series of disappointments			1
@entity34 talent has often fallen foul to ill - discipline on the pitch , arguments off it , ego problems , administrative issues and sheer bad luck			0
@entity15 , @entity17 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 will all be hoping to overcome these hurdles in @entity41 this time and perhaps go even further than their predecessors			0
and @entity1 , who helped @entity7 to @entity10 glory on home soil in 1998 -- coming on as a substitute to set up @entity49 's goal in the shock 3 - 0 final win over @entity41 -- is convinced it will not be too long before an @entity25 champion is crowned			1
" i believe ( they can ) and i really hope they will win the @entity10 in the near future because i think that will help @entity25 football to develop even better , even more , " says @entity1 , who was born in @entity16 but moved to @entity7 as an eight - year - old			1
" and when you look at how many big names @entity25 football has produced in the last few years , it 's unbelievable , " he told @entity0			2
those big names include the likes of @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , who would all love nothing more than to add a @entity10 winners ' medal to their lengthy list of honors in @entity41			2
but while @entity15 and @entity37 have such world - beaters among their ranks , @entity1 feels they will need to be at the top of their game to avoid past disappointments			1
quality @entity37 has earned the nickname " the chokers " -- cruel given the quality of opposition the nation has faced -- after a talented set of individuals struggled to perform when it counted most , failing to make it out of the group stage in both the 2006 and 2010 @entity89			2
when you look at the @entity25 national teams individually , they are really talented so they 've got talent , " @entity1 says			1
" but i think to be in the @entity10 , you need your talented players to be at their best because the quality will make you win , the quality will make the difference			1
" quality will make the player make the difference at the right time when your team needs you			0
you may just go on to create one chance and you need to score the chance to go to the next round			0
" @entity1 , though , believes that for talented players to flourish they must be in a team that has togetherness and unity			1
@entity15 lacked in that department during its disastrous 2010 campaign , where the " @entity15 " had been expected to do well in the first @entity10 held on @entity25 soil			1
@entity65 threatened to snub the competition after being criticized by compatriot @entity118 , himself a former @entity10 star for @entity15			2
and when he did turn up , the four - time african player of the year -- who had just won the @entity122 for the third time , on this occasion with @entity125 -- struggled in @entity8 after not being used in his customary striker 's role			2
@entity129 's @entity128 , meanwhile , found himself on the bench and coach @entity131 was forced to quit after the team failed to register a point for the first time in six appearances at the finals			0
" i would say togetherness ( is important ) , and i think if you want to do well in the championship , in the @entity10 , the team has to be together , " @entity1 says			1
" it has to fight for the same objective and i believe that togetherness will make them go to the end			0
" unity @entity147 certainly played a role in @entity7 's 1998 win			1
@entity151 's squad was seen as representing a new @entity7 , with @entity1 born in @entity16 , @entity152 from @entity17 , @entity153 from @entity154 , @entity155 's family hailing from @entity39 , while others were of @entity158 and @entity159 descent			1
" we had the players from all around the world and i think we showed the diversity of the @entity165 national team , we showed what the diversity of the @entity165 people are , " @entity1 says			2
" we showed to the @entity165 nation what @entity7 is really			1
" if an @entity25 side 's unity can ever be questioned then it could be argued that it has been a result of @entity25 football 's structural failings			2
the @entity177 temporarily suspended @entity65 from playing for the national team in 2011 for instigating the boycott of a friendly in @entity39 over unpaid bonuses			0
@entity182 , meanwhile , has criticized the @entity183 in the past for its poor organizational skills , blaming the governing body for his late return to @entity189 club @entity188 following the @entity190			2
" the only problem in @entity8 is our leaders , who do not respect us , " @entity65 told the @entity192 's ( @entity192 ) official website			0
" until we are respected , other ( continents ) will never have any consideration for us			0
" @entity1 adds : " i think what @entity25 football needs is better organization , better structure , and i think after that we 'll help the players to be more professional when they 're coming to play for their national team ... i think the structure around these players is not strong enough and i think if we do n't have that , it will take time ( for an @entity25 nation ) to win the @entity10			1
" the man in charge of @entity25 football -- @entity192 president @entity210 -- however , feels the structures put in place by his confederation and its member associations should allow for a nation or two to go far in @entity41			1
" i do not see why @entity8 can not have one or two of our representatives reach the semifinals or even the final , " he told @entity192 's official website			0
discipline two representatives from @entity8 reaching the semifinals or final would make for huge progress , given that there has never been more than one at a time to reach the knockout stages			0
that statistic could well have been banished in 1998 had @entity15 's players kept their heads when it mattered most			2
the @entity15 picked up three red cards in just three games , including two in the final group clash against @entity237 -- a match they drew , when victory would have been enough for a place in the second round alongside @entity38			0
" i would talk about discipline ( as being vital if an @entity25 team wants to win the @entity10 ) , " @entity1 says			1
" discipline and sacrifice , so that means you have to concentrate on your objective , you have to concentrate on what you have to do for the months to get at your best , and be at the peak of your game			0
" focus hand - in - hand with discipline often comes focus -- something @entity38 lost for a split - second in 1994 , denying the team a quarterfinal spot , long before @entity16 and @entity17 's heroics			1
the @entity38 were just two minutes away from becoming only the second @entity25 team to reach the last eight at their debut @entity10 , but let a 1 - 0 lead slip against @entity265 before conceding again in extra-time			1
" ( you must ) focus on your objective because when you are in the @entity10 , you can get your head a little bit all over the place , " @entity1 says			1
" and i think it 's important for you to get focused on your objective , focused on what you want to achieve as a team			0
" luck having all these ingredients is no guarantee for success , however , as at a major international tournament the winning team often needs a little luck along the way			0
@entity17 found this out the hard way after a run to the last eight of the @entity285 that captured the imagination of much of @entity8 -- but was brought to an end in the most controversial of circumstances			0
with the @entity17 ' quarterfinal clash against @entity291 destined for penalties with the scores tied at 1 - 1 and just seconds remaining , @entity289 saw his goal - bound header cleared off the line by @entity298 's hand			2
@entity298 was sent off for his actions -- and widely condemned by the world of football afterwards -- but the damage had already been done as @entity303 missed the resulting spot - kick , before @entity291 went on to win the ensuing penalty shootout			0
@entity273 was not on the side of @entity39 in 1982 , either			0
with the @entity307 having already played their final group game , @entity309 knew that a one - or two - goal win over @entity311 would take the neighboring nations through to the second round at the expense of the debutant team			0
after 10 minutes , @entity309 took the lead , before the two teams proceeded to kick the ball around aimlessly for the rest of the match			0
" you need luck , because you will not win the best competition if you do not have luck			0
but the luck , you have to provoke it to make it happen , " says @entity1			2
" i think when you look at all the @entity25 teams who are playing in the @entity10 , they lack one of the five ingredients ( quality , togetherness , discipline , focus or luck )			1
" so hopefully they will have built it all up in the last few weeks so they will get to the first game where the togetherness , the quality of the players , the focus , and of course the luck at the end ( is all there ) , because luck is very important			0

@entity1 believes an @entity25 nation will one *day* win the @entity10
an @entity25 nation has never advanced past the quarterfinal stage
@entity1 , born in @entity16 , won the @entity10 with @entity7 in 1998
