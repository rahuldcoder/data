" beleaguered " was how one @entity61 diplomat described @entity55 's disposition during tuesday 's meeting			0
host country @entity0 , once @entity5 's close @entity65 ally , has called on member countries to condemn @entity5 's raid on the aid convoy			1
the incident has pushed @entity0 to side with @entity5 's enemies @entity4 and @entity71 , in harshly condemning the jewish state			1
@entity74 , which is also a member of @entity54 , condemned the attack as well , prime minister @entity73 said in remarks carried on @entity74 state tv			1

the @entity6 , he added , missed an opportunity by not embracing the deal			0

" asked whether the raid on the flotilla last week will change the way countries vote in the @entity98 , @entity3 said the raid will actually change many things			1
for @entity5 , he said , " it has actually rung the final countdown for its existence			2
it shows that it has no room in the region and no one is ready to live alongside it			0
actually , no country in the world recognizes it , and you know that the @entity164 regime is the backbone of the dictatorial world order			0
