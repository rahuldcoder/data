@entity0 -- a @entity0 court ruled friday that four people can be extradited to the @entity4 to face conspiracy charges after electronic components from a @entity4 company were smuggled to @entity8 and ended up in explosives in @entity10			1
the case is part of an effort by the @entity4 to link @entity8 with attacks on its forces in @entity10			1
the four @entity0 -- three men and a woman -- were arrested in late october			0
they contested the extradition proceedings , and have 15 days to appeal			0
@entity4 authorities indicted them , as well as an @entity8 citizen , on charges of funneling thousands of radio frequency modules from the @entity4 to @entity8			2
the @entity8 citizen , @entity24 , remained at large at the time of the indictment			2
the @entity4 alleges that 16 of the radio frequency modules were later found in improvised explosive devices ( @entity29 ) in @entity10 that had not detonated			1
the explosive devices are often the weapon of choice for militants in @entity10 , who regularly used them to attack @entity4 and coalition convoys			1
@entity35 , the @entity4 ambassador to @entity0 , welcomed the ruling			2
" this ruling reflects the strong spirit of cooperation between the @entity4 and @entity0 in combating transnational crime , including the illicit trade in arms and equipment that can pose significant threats to the @entity4 and the international community , " @entity35 said in a statement			2
following the court 's decision friday , two of the @entity0 -- @entity50 and @entity51 , the female suspect -- will be extradited to be charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the @entity4 in relation to the radio frequency modules			1
the other two -- @entity57 and @entity58 -- will be sent to the @entity4 to be charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the @entity4 regarding the smuggling of dozens of military antennas , like those used on military aircraft and ships , from the @entity4 to @entity65			0
@entity68 , @entity69 and @entity58 plan to appeal , their lawyer said			0
@entity51 's lawyer said he needed to talk to his client before saying whether she would appeal			0
in making a decision on the extradition , the judge , @entity73 , weighed the evidence provided by the @entity4 indictment , citing emails , documents and affidavits from the @entity4 case			2
@entity82 said that if the alleged acts had indeed been committed , they would also be considered " conspiracy and cheating under @entity0 law			0
" he noted that the @entity0 court 's role in considering the extradition request had been " to decide whether there is a prima facie case			0
" @entity82 said that " the task of resolving doubt and weighing the evidence should be left to the trial judge			0
" the @entity4 indictment alleges that the @entity0 conspired to buy 6,000 radio frequency modules from an unidentified company in @entity98 and ship them through @entity0 to @entity24 in @entity8			1
the @entity4 has in the past noted that @entity0 -- a major global transshipment port -- needs to tighten its export controls , in particular of so - called " dual use " items , which can have both a civilian and military purpose in this case , the radio frequency modules from the @entity4 company have various commercial applications , including wireless local area networks to connect printers and computers in offices			1
the @entity4 says that radio frequency modules from the same @entity4 company were recovered in 2008 and 2009 by coalition forces in @entity10 as part of remote detonation systems for improvised explosive devices			1
prosecutors allege that the defendants told the @entity98 company that @entity0 was the final destination for the components they were buying and also filed false paperwork with the @entity4 government , saying the parts would be used in a @entity0 telecommunications project			1
the @entity0 have been held without bail since their arrest , except @entity129 , who was released on bail on medical grounds			0
they will all remain in prison until their extradition , except @entity129 , the judge said friday .			0
