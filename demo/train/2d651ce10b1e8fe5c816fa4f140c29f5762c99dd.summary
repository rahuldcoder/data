-- when @entity2 announced last year that his upcoming hockey movie " @entity3 " would be his final film as a director , you could almost hear a collective sigh of disappointment from hard - core fans of @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity12			1
@entity2 's convenience - store drones and derelicts introduced @entity2 's @entity16 brand of profane wit in 1994â € ²s " clerks , " and a successful 2006 sequel proved that audiences had n't had enough			1
@entity2 's retirement threatened to kill any chances of completing the @entity24 trilogy -- a challenge you 'd think might tempt the " @entity26 " - obsessed @entity2			1
well , there is a new hope			0
last week , during a book signing in @entity31 , he revealed that his beloved characters might be heading to @entity33			1
after seeing the hit play , " seminar , " which reminded @entity2 of the fundamental stagecraft he used to film " clerks , " he suddenly envisioned breathing new life into the franchise with a stage production of " @entity41 " in 2014 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the original			1
it 's still only in early talks , but @entity2 tells @entity0 that he 's already broached the subject with several members of the cast , including the hard - to - wrangle @entity49 , who played irreverent slacker , @entity11			1
the writer / director / @entity12 shared his hopes in an exclusive conversation with @entity0			2
@entity0 : have you had any recent discussions -- formal or informal -- with the cast from the first two " clerks " about another potential edition , whether it be on the stage or on the screen ? @entity2 : @entity49 was the first person i reached out to			1
i sent him an email after i 'd seen @entity65 in " seminar " in february : " you 're the first person i 'm gon na tell ... " clerks iii " is gon na be a play on @entity33			2
we 'll do a six month run and sell out the entirety in advance			0
you up for six shows a week , sir ? live ? " to which @entity49 responded , " @entity76 lay off the weed , sir			0
" i told @entity78 [ @entity79 ] , just before we went onstage to do our " @entity81 " live podcast in @entity82			0
he asked if he could be his own understudy			0
i have n't spoken to @entity83 [ @entity84 ] yet , but he 's the only one of us with actual theatrical training , so this will be right up his alley			0
i know i 'll need @entity88 [ @entity89 ] as well , because @entity90 from " @entity91 " will feature prominently			0
@entity93 's @entity92 would feature in a pre-recorded bit			0
@entity0 : @entity49 was initially cool to the idea of " @entity91 " is @entity49 just a stubborn negotiator , or does he truly lack an interest in doing this again ? @entity2 : it took a long time to convince @entity49 to do " @entity91 , " but we were both really happy with how the script turned out			1
ultimately , i think @entity49 would be into it if the script is good and so long as the the @entity105 is nowhere near it			0
but if we do n't get @entity49 , it wo n't happen			0
he 's the key to " @entity41 " for me			2
@entity0 : how exactly would clerks on @entity33 work ? @entity2 : i 'll make it as painless as i can : a six month run that culminates with a one - night performance we broadcast into movie theaters -- like we did with " @entity115 " a few months back			1
so ultimately , anyone who ca n't make it to @entity33 to see the show can go to the movie theater the night we stream the production and see if for like 20 bucks			2
the hardest part for me wo n't be making it happen ; the hardest part at this point , for me , will be standing on a stage for two hours and not talking			0
@entity0 : last we saw , @entity10 and @entity11 had purchased the @entity41 , and @entity10 was going to be a father / husband			1
where might they be now ? what 's changed ? @entity2 : it 's finally @entity11 's turn to fall in love -- just as everything else falls apart			2
@entity0 : lastly , and most importantly , would the donkey show in a " @entity41 " stage production be depicted by the same puppeteers who perform in " @entity136 " ? @entity2 : if we can woo those f * * * ers over to our stables , maybe we can get @entity141 to direct the movie version of " @entity143 " then i can direct a " @entity146 " sequel without feeling like a d * * *			1
