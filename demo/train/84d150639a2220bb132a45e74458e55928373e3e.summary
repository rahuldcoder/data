-- the last month has seen a blizzard of new sex abuse accusations against the @entity3 from across the @entity4			1
almost all of them -- and the intense media attention they 've garnered -- can be traced to one man : a @entity9 lawyer named @entity10			1
last week , an alleged victim of priest abuse in @entity13 announced a lawsuit against the @entity15 itself			0
@entity10 is representing the alleged victim			2
a couple of days earlier , a @entity18 man who alleged abuse by a priest years ago filed suit against @entity18 's top @entity3 cleric in a @entity4 court			1
the plaintiff is another @entity10 client			2
and throughout april , new documents have come to light suggesting that the current pope may have played down warnings about abusive priests in the @entity4			2
those documents came from @entity10 's @entity31 , @entity9 , office			1
for decades , @entity10 has won settlements from @entity3 archdioceses across the country for abuse victims and , more than any other attorney in the country , has driven @entity4 media coverage of the church abuse scandal			1
now , with the church abuse crisis embroiling @entity42 for the first time and raising questions about whether the pope himself did enough to respond to church abuse , @entity10 is employing novel legal tactics in an attempt to take his campaign all the way to the @entity15			1
" i 'm getting far more aggressive because all roads are leading to @entity55 , " @entity10 , 62 , said last thursday , after filing suit against the @entity15 on behalf of the alleged @entity13 abuse victim			1
" i 'm pessimistic that the @entity15 is capable of changing itself but i 'm optimistic that external pressure will , " @entity10 said			2
" we 're at a tipping point			0
" @entity10 's last sex abuse suit against the @entity15 , filed in 2002 , has wound its way through the courts , with the @entity4 @entity63 now considering whether to hear the case			1
but @entity10 's critics say that last week 's suit against the @entity15 , along with much of his other work , is aimed more at attracting publicity than getting justice			1
" @entity10 has sued the @entity15 many times , and has never won , " said @entity70 , president of the @entity71			2
" he knows he will lose again this time , but that means nothing to him			0
what this is all about is grandstanding : getting more pr for himself and throwing more mud at the @entity3			2
" @entity10 's firm -- @entity10 & @entity82 , which employs four other lawyers -- has filed hundreds of sex abuse suits against the church			1
though he wo n't disclose how much he has won in settlements , @entity10 is thought to be responsible for a good chunk of the roughly $ 2.5 billion that , according to the @entity88 , the @entity4 @entity3 has paid to sex abuse victims to date			1
he was among the lawyers representing abuse victims in the $ 600 million settlement with the @entity94 in 2007 , the church 's largest payout ever			1
the settlements started out much smaller			0
when @entity10 filed his first church lawsuit on behalf of a @entity9 plaintiff who in 1983 alleged priest sexual abuse , he was one of the only lawyers in the country taking on such cases			1
he says the abuse suit -- which targeted the archdiocese of @entity31 and @entity105 and the diocese of @entity107 , @entity9 -- was the first against an @entity3 diocese			1
@entity10 says he won a $ 1 million plus settlement for his client			2
but his proudest moment in the case was convincing his client to resist signing a confidentially agreement so that he could go public with his story			0
" as a result , dozens of other kids abused by that priest broke their silence , " @entity10 said			2
that knack for getting clients to publicize their stories of priestly abuse -- largely through the news media -- and spurring other victims to break their silence has been an @entity10 trademark ever since			1
in the early 1990s , @entity10 represented victims of abuse by rev. @entity128 , a @entity129 priest whose taped comments about having molested " from 50 to 100 ( children ) , " made him one of the first abusive priests to earn national headlines			2
the media attention brought @entity10 more business			2
" i remember reading a newspaper story about a priest that had molested a bunch of kids and it was the first written statement i 'd seen about being sexually abused by a priest , " said @entity136 , a former client of @entity10 's			1
" it was an a-ha moment			0
i said , ' my @entity144 -- i 'm not the only one			0
' and the article mentioned @entity10 's firm			1
" by that time , @entity10 had shifted from his initial focus on civil rights and poverty law to take on abuse cases full time			1
" that 's what sustains me -- the connection with the survivors and their families , " he said			0
" initially it 's their pain , and then it 's their strength			0
they 're giving me a lot more than i 'm giving them			0
" even some of @entity10 's opponents see him more as a true believer than a church - obsessed variation of a lawyerly ambulance chaser			1
" @entity10 is not just after money , " said @entity170 , a @entity4 - based lawyer for the @entity15			1
" he has enough to buy his own island if he wants			0
( but ) what he is doing in these cases is part of his conception of himself			0
people figure out in life that there was something they really want to do , and i think he believes he has figured that out			0
" @entity10 raised three children in the @entity185 tradition of his first wife , but his work representing abuse victims in the 1980s turned him off to organized religion			1
he became an atheist but says he regained his faith 13 years ago , when he began confronting his alcoholism at aa meetings			0
" i had to look at myself and turn things over to a higher spiritual power , " said @entity10 , who does n't identify with a religious tradition and describes his faith as " eclectic			0
" in 2002 , revelations of church abuse and cover - up in @entity200 set off a wave of priest abuse allegations that turned church lawsuits into a national industry			1
" until that time , it was a solo journey , " @entity10 said			0
" that set me on another trajectory entirely , with an intensity that has n't slowed much if it all			0
" while the @entity200 scandal was still breaking , @entity10 filed his first suit against the @entity15 , on behalf of a @entity212 , @entity213 , man who said he 'd been abused by a priest as a teenager			2
@entity10 argued that the @entity15 , as the priest 's employer , is ultimately responsible for the abuse			1
the @entity63 is deciding whether to hear the case			0
a lower court has rejected the @entity15 's argument that it is protected by the @entity222			0
the lawsuit @entity10 filed last week against the @entity15 goes much further , naming the @entity15 , pope @entity224 and the @entity15 's current and former secretaries of state as defendants			2
the suit alleges that the @entity15 had received a 1995 letter from a deaf @entity4 claiming that he 'd been abused by a @entity13 priest named rev. @entity231 but that the @entity15 allowed the priest to retain his position			0
the suit , filed by an unnamed plaintiff , seeks to force the @entity15 to open its files on other abusive priests			0
the @entity15 says the suit will fail because individual archdioceses , not the pope , are responsible for responding to abuse allegations			0
" @entity10 's mantra is that all roads lead to @entity55 , " says @entity242 , the @entity15 lawyer			1
" i have a different message that @entity10 wishes to ignore : this @entity3 is administratively decentralized and decision making takes place largely on the local level			1
mine is a more complex message , but it has the virtue of being right			0
" but that does n't mean that the @entity15 will stop paying close attention to @entity10			0
" @entity10 is such a media mover and shaker that when i go on an airplane , i 'll call him and say ' i 'm going to be on the plane for six or seven hours , so do n't do anything -- i wo n't have a chance to respond ! ' " said @entity242			2
" ... he is half media man and half lawyer and has been successful at both			0
" for @entity10 , both halves would likely be taken as a compliment .			0

@entity10 has driven @entity4 media coverage of the church abuse scandal
in 1983 , he was one of the only lawyers in the country taking on such cases
he has been a key figure in bulk of settlements @entity4 @entity3 has paid out
critics : @entity10 's work is aimed more at attracting publicity than getting justice
