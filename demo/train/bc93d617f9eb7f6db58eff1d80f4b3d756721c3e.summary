-- when @entity3 sit down with their families for @entity6 dinner , most of us will probably gorge ourselves on the same traditional @entity6 menu , with turkey , cranberry sauce , stuffing , and pumpkin pie taking up the most real estate on our plates			1
pumpkin pie did n't make an appearance at the @entity6 , though pumpkins were probably served			1
how did these dishes become the national " what you eat on @entity6 " options , though ? are they holdovers from the @entity6 , or did they gradually sneak in ? the @entity22 may not have had turkey @entity24 may not have been on the menu at the 1621 celebration by the @entity22 of @entity27 that is widely considered the @entity6 ( though fans of @entity30 's @entity29 might quibble with the " first " part )			2
there were definitely wild turkeys in the @entity27 area , as colonist @entity35 noted in his journal			0
however , the best existing account of the @entity22 ' harvest feast comes from colonist @entity39 , author of " @entity40 : a journal of the @entity22 at @entity27			2
" @entity39 's first - hand account of the @entity6 included no explicit mention of turkey			1
he does , however , mention the @entity22 gathering " wild fowl " for the meal , although that could just as likely have meant ducks or geese			0
so why do we chow down on turkey , then ? it helps to know a bit about the history of @entity6			2
while the idea of giving thanks and celebrating the harvest was popular in certain parts of the country , it was by no means an annual national holiday			0
presidents would occasionally declare a @entity6 celebration , but the holiday had n't completely caught on nationwide			2
many of these early celebrations included turkey ; @entity68 once remarked that , " no citizen of the @entity3 shall refrain from turkey on @entity6			1
" @entity0 : @entity72 ways to prepare turkey when @entity76 's journals were reprinted in 1856 after being lost for a century , they found a receptive audience with advocates who wanted @entity6 turned into a national holiday			1
since @entity35 wrote of how the colonists had hunted wild turkeys during the autumn of 1621 and since turkey is a uniquely @entity3 ( and scrumptious ) bird , it gained traction as the @entity6 meal of choice for @entity3 after @entity89 declared @entity6 a national holiday in 1863			1
moreover , there were pragmatic reasons for eating turkey rather than , say , chicken at a feast like @entity6			2
the birds are large enough that they can feed a table full of hungry family members , and unlike chickens or cows , they did n't serve much utilitarian purpose like laying eggs or making milk			0
unlike pork , turkey was n't so common that it did n't seem like a suitable choice for a special occasion , either			0
an interesting 2007 piece in @entity109 discussed these reasons for turkey 's prominence , but also made another intriguing point			2
the publication of " @entity115 " in 1843 may have helped force along the turkey 's cause as a holiday delicacy when @entity120 magnanimously sends the @entity122 family a @entity124 turkey			1
@entity0 : 10 things that deflated the @entity127 's parade there was no cranberry sauce , either while the cranberries the @entity22 needed were probably easy to come by , making cranberry sauce requires sugar			1
@entity133 was a rare luxury at the time of @entity6 , so while revelers may have eaten cranberries it 's unlikely that the feast featured the tasty sauce			1
what 's more , it 's not even entirely clear that cranberry sauce had been invented yet			1
it 's not until 1663 that visitors to the area started commenting on a sweet sauce made of boiled cranberries that accompanied meat			0
there 's the same problem with potatoes			0
neither sweet potatoes nor white potatoes were available to the colonists in 1621 , so the @entity22 definitely did n't feast on everyone 's favorite tubers			0
but they had plenty of venison @entity39 mentions in his writings that the governor sent out a party of four men to do some fowling for the feast , but the @entity22 and @entity166 also enjoyed five deer as part of their feasting			0
the meat supposedly arrived at the celebration as a gift from the @entity166 king @entity173			0
on top of the venison , other meats probably included lots of fish and shellfish , which were staples of the @entity22 ' diets			0
so if you want to wolf down a lobster or some oysters in lieu of turkey on thursday , nobody can fault you for being historically inaccurate			0
and pumpkin pie did n't cap things off it may be the flagship dessert at modern @entity6 dinners , but pumpkin pie did n't make an appearance at the @entity6			1
the @entity22 probably lacked the butter and flour needed to make a pie crust , and it 's not clear that they even had an oven in which they could have baked a pumpkin pie			1
that does n't mean pumpkins were n't available for the meal , though ; they were probably served after being baked in the coals of a fire or stewed			0
pumpkin pie became a popular dish on 17th - century @entity3 tables , though , and it might have shown up for @entity6 as early as the second celebration of the holiday in 1623			1
