it started with a chance conversation between a doctor and a nurse several years ago			1
but that brief encounter may end up exposing what could be one of the largest @entity8 frauds in @entity10 history			1
dr. @entity11 , a medical director at dialysis clinics in @entity13 , was discussing clinic procedures with one of the nurses , @entity15			2
the two men say they saw something they believed was very wrong : expensive medicine , and lots of it , was being tossed in the trash			2
and the clinic workers were being told to do it , the two men say			2
" when we sat down and started talking about it and getting into details , we actually realized exactly what was going on , " @entity11 said			2
the alleged waste was being carried out on a massive scale and , the nurse and the doctor said , they knew why almost immediately			1
they claim it was a way for their company , @entity35 , to defraud the government , overbill @entity8 and @entity38 and make a fortune			1
" we 're talking in the hundreds of millions , easily , " @entity11 said			2
" the profit this company raked from those two schemes , only from those two drugs , was hundreds of millions of dollars			1
" the allegations of massive fraud have implications for all @entity10			2
the alleged fraud would have involved @entity8 and @entity38 patients , whose medicine is paid for by @entity10 taxpayers			1
@entity11 and @entity15 said the alleged fraud schemes they discovered were going on at the company 's clinics all across the country -- at the time , about 2003 through 2010 , more than 1,800 -- with tens of thousands of patients			1
it was enormous , they claim , and @entity59 said it was all a deliberate strategy coordinated by the company			1
" it was just a scheme in order to fraudulently increase and maximize and boost the @entity8 revenue , @entity8 payment , so therefore fraudulently increase their revenue , " he said			1
@entity35 , based in downtown @entity67 , is one of the nation 's largest dialysis companies			2
the name means " @entity72 " in @entity73			2
the company just moved into a brand new $ 101 million office tower , complete with fountains , gardens and even a suspended ski gondola inside for private meetings			1
@entity35 has grown in the past couple of years and now runs roughly 2,000 dialysis clinics across the country , which has added up to a $ 7 billion business			2
the dialysis empire is run by ceo @entity85 , who dresses like one of the @entity87 , has adopted a company slogan of ' @entity89 ' and in company staff meetings leads his employees , who he calls villagers , in cheers of " @entity35 ! " @entity85 is reportedly paid an estimated $ 15 million a year , according to the @entity94 , which has called him the best compensated ceo in @entity96			1
most of @entity35 's revenue comes from a single source : taxpayers			2
more than two - thirds of @entity35 's revenue comes from @entity8 and @entity38 payments			1
if @entity11 and @entity15 's allegations are true , the company threw away hundreds of millions of dollars of medicine , and taxpayers paid for it			1
and , if true , the alleged fraud schemes could represent one of the largest @entity8 frauds in @entity10 history			1
@entity59 explained to @entity112 how @entity35 instructed its nurses to administer a 100 - milligram dose of the iron drug @entity116			2
" for example , if a patient requires this dose once per week , you 'd administer 100 milligrams , waste nothing and charge @entity8 for 100 milligrams , " he said			1
" but what @entity35 did , instead of charge ( for ) one vial , they give 50 milligrams of this vial ( and ) put the residual into the trash			2
with another vial , he said , the company would give 25 milligrams to a patient and put the rest in the trash , then repeat it with yet another vial , when one vial could have been given without waste			1
the more vials @entity35 used , the more the company was able to bill the government , the men say			1
@entity11 and @entity15 claim they tried to call attention to the massive waste and tried to get it stopped			1
but instead , they say , they were basically told to stop causing trouble and to continue following the company 's protocols			1
" that 's what upset me the most , " @entity15 said			2
" and that 's when i went to dr. @entity11			2
i said , ' dr. @entity11 , i ca n't do that			2
' " @entity15 says he quit his job and left the clinic rather than continue where fraud was going on			0
@entity11 claims the company punished him for speaking up			1
" of course , once they found out , they did not renew my medical directorship or my practice , " @entity11 claimed			0
" we are a three - physician practice , and it was a significant loss of revenue			0
" today , both men have filed a whistleblower lawsuit under the @entity10 @entity167 on behalf of the @entity10 government , charging @entity35 with massive @entity8 fraud			1
they stand to make millions if @entity35 is found guilty			0
@entity35 's ceo would n't talk , but the company 's attorney @entity171 did			1
when asked about the plaintiffs ' allegation that @entity35 had come up with so - called schemes to throw away drugs and maximize profits , @entity171 said : " well that 's just wrong			0
if you look at the facts of the case , first of all , the doctors make the dosing decisions ...			1
when you look at what the practices were -- decisions being made by doctors , based on what was in the best interest of their patients			1
and they took into account a variety of things			0
" you ca n't just look at one issue			0
you have to look at things like infection control , what the patient 's going to do , how the patient 's going to do with particular doses			0
and so , during that entire time what we did , what the doctors did , was appropriate			0
" but other companies , including @entity35 's main competitor , used smaller vials and smaller combinations at times , limiting what was thrown away			0
@entity35 reiterated its decisions to throw away medicine were for " sound clinical reasons " and " never to increase wastage			1
" @entity220 ' attorneys @entity221 and @entity222 , who claim @entity35 made as much as $ 800 million over-billing the government , say that @entity35 's defense wo n't hold up in court			1
" it 's not just the taxpayers that are the victims here , it 's the health care system , " @entity221 said			0
" it does n't take a graduate degree to understand what 's going on here , " @entity222 said			0
" this is just dishonesty			0
" @entity35 denies that and vows to fight the case in court			1
but earlier this year , while denying it did anything wrong , @entity35 settled a similar case in @entity240 for $ 55 million			0
@entity241 , with the watchdog group " @entity243 , " says the bigger problem is that even if a company gets caught cheating the government , the company executives never seem to face any punishment			1
fines are paid and business continues as usual			0
" the way it 's set up right now , if the fraud is not caught , then taxpayers foot the bill , @entity241 said			0
" if the fraud is caught , stockholders foot the bill			0
" @entity259 and others have been arguing for much harsher treatment when companies are found guilty of defrauding the federal government			0
he points to record billion - dollar fines , particularly in the pharmaceutical business , that are paid , but executives do n't get punished and the companies continue to do business with the government			0
in fact , one of @entity35 's defenses to @entity112 is that the federal government itself declined to charge the company with wrongdoing , even after reviewing the fraud allegations			1
" the government has come in and thoroughly investigated what the allegations are , and in both cases the government decided to drop it and move on , " @entity171 said			0
federal prosecutors in @entity13 declined to intervene in the case but stated in a letter that decision " should not be construed as a statement about the merits of the case			0
" the short - staffed @entity10 @entity289 declines to join lawsuits all the time , instead allowing private citizens who hire private lawyers to essentially prosecute for the government , @entity241 said			0
" the @entity10 @entity289 simply does n't have the people , " @entity241 said			0
" it should have the people			0
i think we all would agree to that			0
" which brings us back to the original meeting of one doctor and one nurse who now stand to make millions if these allegations of fraud are proven true			1
the biggest winners , though , in their lawsuit could be taxpayers			0
the @entity10 government will recover the bulk of whatever they win			0
they and others like them are essentially the @entity10 taxpayers ' deputies in the fight against health care fraud			0
asked if they are surprised that they have to defend the @entity10 taxpayer , @entity15 said simply , " i 'm not surprised			0
it 's not easy to come forward and stand up and tell the truth , but it 's the right thing to do			0
" the case is set for trial later next year .			0
