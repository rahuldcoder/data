-- it looked like @entity2 was in the midst of a familiar charge after it beat @entity5 at the end of december for a sixth straight win			2
but the momentum was snapped by @entity9 to begin 2014 and the @entity10 suffered their second consecutive defeat at @entity12 when they were humbled by modest @entity13 2 - 1 sunday in the third round of the @entity15			1
a late red card brandished to @entity17 proved costly			0
@entity13 had never won at the @entity12 in 10 previous visits and only returned to the top flight of @entity21 football three years ago following a near 30 - year absence			1
@entity2 manager @entity23 did n't exactly field the reserves , either , although @entity25 was n't in the squad as he continues to nurse a groin injury and @entity28 remained sidelined			2
" when you lose games at any club , it 's difficult , " @entity23 told @entity29			2
" we 've got a big game on tuesday ( in the @entity37 semifinals ) and we 'll get the team ready for that			0
" we were a bit unlucky to lose			0
we had some opportunities , not enough , and we were down to 10 men			0
" @entity43 opened the scoring for @entity13 -- which visits @entity12 in the @entity45 next saturday -- in the 12th minute but @entity46 leveled four minutes later			1
instead of going into another gear as it had done so often in the past under former boss @entity49 , @entity2 allowed the @entity51 side to stay in the game			2
" we played quite well at times , got near the edge of the box quite regularly but did n't make an opportunity to score the goal , " said @entity23			0
" i thought for long periods we had good control of the game			0
" @entity17 was dismissed for an 80th - minute challenge on @entity61 and 10 minutes later , surging striker @entity62 headed home @entity43 's cross to hand @entity2 a fourth loss in its last six outings at @entity12			1
@entity62 scored twice against @entity2 's city rival , @entity67 , on wednesday			1
" we were coming here to not lose , and this is perfect for us , " @entity62 told @entity29			0
" i think the key to the game was the red card			0
we had to do our best to get one more chance			0
" @entity73 and @entity74 earlier survived upset bids from @entity76 and @entity77 , respectively , in football 's oldest knockout competition , both winning 2 - 0			1
@entity81 , last in the @entity45 , beat third - tier @entity82 3 - 1 but @entity84 's struggles continued as @entity85 of the @entity86 crushed the @entity84 5 - 0			1
the fourth round draw produced only one all - @entity45 tie , @entity89 at @entity73 .			1

@entity13 scores a late goal to beat @entity2 2 - 1 in the @entity15
it was @entity2 's fourth loss in its last six games at @entity12

the fourth round draw produced one all - @entity45 tie , @entity89 at @entity73
