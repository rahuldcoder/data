@entity0 , @entity1 -- in 1883 , what was to become the iconic @entity5 train pulled out of @entity0 ' @entity6 on its maiden voyage to @entity9 , or @entity10 as it was known at the time			1
it was the creation of an entrepreneurial @entity13 , @entity14 , who had already founded the @entity0 - based parent company , the @entity15			1
now , the @entity17 @entity1 national rail company is planning on bringing the @entity5 back to life and before doing so has teamed up with the @entity19 to bring to the public a long lost era when time had another meaning and traveling to @entity9 took four days and three nights			1
@entity26 dream it 's important to make one thing clear right away : the superb new exhibit , @entity30 , thoroughly indulges in @entity31 ; the exhibit celebrates the romanticized images that @entity34 had of the @entity35 during the late 19th century to the first half of the 20th			2
from the @entity39 to the @entity40 , mega-museums go big curator @entity41 and his advisers were perfectly aware that they might be accused of colonial nostalgia , and have gone about the exhibit intelligently , putting it into the historic and political context of the time			0
moreover , that this world was a @entity49 fantasy no longer becomes important when visitors board the several perfectly restored carriages of the @entity5 parked in front of the @entity19 : we would all have liked to be passengers on the train			1
stepping back in time the idea , explained @entity41 , is to climb on board and imagine that the train has stopped in a station and the passengers have gotten out to stretch their legs , leaving their possessions in the carriages , a fur , a silk scarf or a tweed jacket draped over the seats			1
the first carriage is the 1929 @entity69 , luxuriously decorated by @entity70 with molten glass nymphets set in panels made from @entity74 mahogany			0
@entity76 flutes are set on a table ; a coat and women 's scarf are thrown negligently over the back of a club chair			2
a copy of @entity85 newspaper from 1883 refers to the @entity5 's first trip ; photographs were not yet in use , the article is accompanied by an engraving of the train			1
scrap metal find turns out to be a $ 33 million @entity94 golden egg on another table there is a bottle of brandy and a package of @entity101 cigarettes			0
the décor makes reference to the personalities who traveled in the train and often wrote about it -- @entity1 novelist @entity107 , @entity108 when he worked as an intelligence officer using the cover of a butterfly collector or @entity112 , the spy			2
@entity113 was involved in an @entity5 rail accident in 1931 when @entity116 fascists destroyed a section of a viaduct near @entity119 ; she gave an impromptu concert to calm the survivors			1
one table is set up with a @entity124 portable typewriter in honor of @entity126 , whose 1932 novel @entity127 , later adapted to film , was set on the @entity5			2
in another compartment identical to the one in scenes from the 1963 @entity133 film from @entity134 with @entity135 , the movie is projected onto a screen			0
with wall panels in precious wood and door handles in gilded brass , each compartment had a matching washbasin and a built - in toiletries cabinet			0
is @entity0 still cool ? @entity144 the 1929 @entity146 's décor was more abstract with @entity70 floral motifs in molten glass set into plane tree paneling			1
a salon - bar is equipped with bridge tables and armchairs ; gambling was regular pastime during the journey			0
cupboards are stocked with champagne and @entity159 wine			0
the exhibit would not be complete without mention of @entity162 , whose celebrated 1934 novel " @entity166 " took place almost entirely on the train			1
@entity162 's place at a table is set up opposite her archeologist husband @entity170 with whom she frequently traveled , taking the extension of the @entity5 , the @entity172 , which covered routes from @entity9 to @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 , passing through the cities of @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 or @entity181			1
icon of travel the second part of the exhibit is inside the @entity19 and includes an exact model reproduction of the @entity5 chugging around on a long toy track			2
( the actual speed was 70 kilometers an hour )			0
a section of the museum is devoted to the @entity192 world and the @entity172 train extension			2
a large - scale interactive map helpfully points out the major historical and political changes in the region from the fall of the @entity198 , the @entity200 agreement , the @entity201 , the @entity202 up to the creation of the @entity205 state			0
a gorgeous collection of @entity208 vintage travel posters is displayed , depicting the @entity209 and other @entity211 monuments in vibrant colors , but also luxury hotels			0
the @entity15 opened hotels ( such as the @entity215 in @entity9 ) in many of the cities the @entity5 and @entity172 stopped in , in order to provide passengers with the luxury they were accustomed to			1
one of the highlights of the exhibit is a documentary made in @entity224 with two former employees of the @entity172			0
at 95 and 100 years respectively , one sold @entity172 tickets for @entity228 in @entity178 , while the other was a mechanic			0
these men provide the link to today 's world and are living proof of another epoch			2
the exhibit may travel next to @entity236 , which was the last destination the @entity5 traveled to from @entity0 , to @entity238 , the birthplace of @entity240 , and finally , @entity9			1
too haute to handle : inside the world 's biggest furniture fair @entity244 's new @entity243 transforms humble @entity245 into high art twentieth century 's most stunning jewels			0

a new exhibition aims to show the former *splendor* of @entity5
the iconic train 's first voyage was in 1883 , and it connected @entity0 to @entity9 with stops on the way
the train 's luxurious carriages *welcomed* *royalty* , *business* elites and celebrated artists
it also inspired many novels such as @entity162 's " @entity166 "
