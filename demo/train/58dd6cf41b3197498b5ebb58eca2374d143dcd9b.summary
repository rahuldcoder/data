" the words of @entity7 's first advertising slogan , coined by its founder @entity8 in 1892 , still seem relevant 120 years later , even among rumors that @entity7 is considering bankruptcy			1
with the digital age upon us , the term " point and shoot " has developed a new meaning			0
but for those who grew up using -- and developing -- film , there was a lot more to photography than just pointing and shooting			2
@entity22 contributor @entity20 found that out the hard way			1
as a 17 - year - old fan of the @entity27 , it was only in her wildest dreams that she would attend their concert			1
hanging out with them in their dressing room was unfathomable -- until 1965			0
" my most memorable @entity7 moment has got to be the day i spent 30 minutes with the @entity27 , " she told @entity22			1
her @entity36 camera in hand , @entity20 went backstage to meet the @entity27 in @entity38 , @entity39			1
she realized too late that her one flashcube -- a disposable flash that had four one - time - use flashbulbs -- was missing a bulb			0
her father had gone back to the car to get another cube but did n't return before @entity20 was whisked backstage			1
she took photos of @entity48 flipping through a magazine , @entity50 acting goofy and @entity51 in the shower room tuning a guitar before her flashcube ran out of juice			0
she said @entity57 -- her favorite @entity27 at the time -- looked around for an extra but could n't find one			1
they took the photo anyway ; the florescent lights brightened the room plenty			0
a problem of the film age : not realizing until too late that the image would be underexposed			2
without the additional light from the flash , the photo was too dark and did n't turn out			0
her photo set with the @entity27 was incomplete			1
" my loss , " she said			0
but having those other images made the surreal experience come to life			0

" @entity7 set the bar on color contrast , saturation and the parameters of color i look for , " he said			2
this was something @entity84 believes @entity82 in particular really excelled at			2
it was this film that @entity101 photographer @entity100 used for his famous 1985 " @entity104 girl " image			2

" you get good really quick or you go broke , " he added			0
" it 's not like digital photography where you click away at no cost			2
" while he still uses film , @entity84 has noticed a sharp drop in its availability in stores			1
when processing fees are added -- at around $ 50 a roll -- the price jumps quickly			0
still , he said , the quality just is n't there with digital , so for special occasions he still uses film -- and @entity7 's @entity127 is one of his favorites			1
