in a sign of the political hangover congressional republicans are suffering in the wake of the government shutdown , three - quarters of @entity1 in a new national poll say that most @entity9 members of @entity10 do n't deserve to be re-elected			1
a @entity13 / @entity12 survey released monday also found a majority saying that the @entity16 ' policies are too extreme			1
and according to the poll , @entity17 have an 8 - point advantage over the @entity16 in an early indicator in the battle for control of @entity10			0
but with more than a year to go until the 2014 midterm elections , there 's plenty of time for these numbers to change			1
@entity13 poll : @entity30 , @entity29 take big post-shutdown hit the poll was conducted friday through sunday , just after the end of the 16 - day partial federal government shutdown that was sparked in part by an effort by @entity38 conservatives to dismantle the health care law , which is president @entity40 's signature domestic achievement			1
a majority of those questioned blamed congressional republicans for the government shutdown and said the president was the bigger winner in the deal to end the crisis			0
the survey also found nearly eight in 10 saying the shutdown was bad for the country , and the standoff has led to a loss of confidence and satisfaction in government			0
and more than seven in 10 think that another shutdown is likely			0
@entity59 directed at congressional @entity30 more than seven in 10 questioned in the survey said that most members of @entity10 do n't deserve to be re-elected , with nearly four in 10 saying even their own representative does n't deserve a return ticket to @entity65 next year			1
both figures are hovering around all - time highs in @entity13 polling			1
" although incumbent members of @entity10 of both parties are not very popular , the shutdown seems to have only affected views of @entity9 incumbents , " @entity13 polling director @entity69 said			1
defeated @entity9 hopes to unite , fight another day three - fourths of people questioned in the survey said that most congressional @entity30 do n't deserved to be re-elected , 21 percentage points higher than the 54 % who say most @entity17 do n't deserve another term in office			1
only one in five say most @entity30 deserve to be re-elected ; 42 % say the same thing about @entity17 on @entity83			2
@entity17 hold early 2014 polling lead the shutdown seems to be making an impact on polls asking the generic ballot question : would you vote for the @entity17 or @entity9 candidate in your congressional district			1
there is no mention of the names of any candidates			0
fifty percent of registered voters questioned said they would vote for the @entity97 in their district , with 42 % backing the @entity9			1
the 8 - point @entity17 margin in the @entity13 poll is the same as in a recent @entity104 / @entity103 survey and close to the 9 - point advantage for the @entity17 in the generic ballot in a recent @entity108 poll			1
while the generic ballot is a much - watched gauge , it 's important to remember that the battle for the @entity38 is a district - by - district fight , rather than a national race , and just 17 of the @entity16 are in districts won by @entity40 in last year 's election			1
@entity40 wants new approach after shutdown " we 're a long way away from saying that the @entity17 have a chance to regain control of the @entity38 , " @entity69 cautioned			0
" there is more than a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the ' generic ballot ' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections			0
a year before the 2010 midterms , for example , the @entity17 held a 6 - point lead on the generic ballot			2
" the @entity16 eventually won back control of the @entity38 in 2010 , thanks to a historic 63 - seat pickup			0
@entity134 : read the entire poll satisfied ? @entity9 too extreme ? one major concern for @entity30 is the growing number of @entity1 who think the party is too extreme			1
fifty - six percent now feel that way , up from 48 % in march			2
by contrast , 52 % say that the policies of the @entity17 are generally mainstream ( with 42 % saying they are too extreme ) , which is unchanged since march			2
" any connection with the tea party movement is n't helping the @entity9 , " @entity69 added			1
" six in 10 @entity1 now believe that the tea party movement is too extreme ; only one in four consider it to be generally mainstream			1
" the poll indicates that @entity30 themselves are divided on whether the 4 1/2 - year - old grassroots conservative movement is too extreme or generally mainstream			1
four things we learned from government shutdown @entity154 fifty - two percent say congressional @entity30 were more responsible for the shutdown , with 34 % pointing more fingers at the president			2
at 45 % -36 % , independents place more blame with the @entity9 in @entity10			2
the poll indicates @entity40 was the clear winner			0
sixty - four percent say the president got more of what he wanted out of the deal to end the shutdown , with less than one in five saying the @entity9 in @entity10 were the winners			0
more than seven in 10 republicans and conservatives agree that @entity40 got more of what he wanted			0
fifty - five percent of the public say the @entity9 strategy to link dismantling parts of @entity175 to funding the government was a mistake , with 42 % saying it made sense at the time			1
while vast majority of @entity17 say the strategy was a mistake , independents are divided , and most republicans say the move made sense			0
the next shutdown ? while the @entity9 does n't fare well in the poll , the poll suggests that the public is looking for almost as much compromise from the @entity17 as from the @entity16 in any bipartisan agreements			2
forty - nine percent say the @entity30 should give up more than the @entity17 in any future bipartisan agreement , but nearly as many -- 44 % -- would prefer to see the @entity17 give up more than the @entity9			1
and seven in 10 say that another shutdown is likely when current funding for the federal government runs out in mid-january			0
" that 's probably because @entity1 have lost confidence in the people who run government , " @entity69 said			0
according to the poll , only a third say they have a great deal or some confidence in the people who run government , down 10 points since may			0
and only 14 % say they are satisfied with the way the nation is being governed			0
" that 's an 11 - point drop since march and is lower than the 26 % who felt that way in september of 1973 , when the @entity214 crisis was in full swing , " @entity69 added			0
in another sign of anti-washington sentiment , six in 10 say the government should not do more to solve the country 's problems			2
he poll was conducted for @entity13 by @entity12 october 18 - 20 , with 841 adults nationwide questioned by telephone			2
the survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .			0

@entity13 poll finds significantly more feel that @entity30 should be voted out
poll also finds that half say they would vote for @entity97 while only 43 % would go @entity9
polling expert cautions that with midterms a year away , there 's time for sentiment to change
six in 10 say they find the tea party too extreme and that brings @entity9 numbers down
