-- @entity1 is getting into the tablet business			1
the company announced a new 10 - inch tablet called the @entity5 on tuesday at a press event in @entity7			1
the @entity9 device is @entity1 's first full - sized tablet			1
the @entity12 company is also going bigger with its smartphone line			0
it is releasing a new pair of colorful , big - screen smartphones : the 6 - inch @entity15 9 @entity17 and the lower - end 1320			1
the @entity5 tablet will cost $ 499 and run @entity9 8.1 , a limited variation of the @entity20 operating system that uses that system 's tile - based touchscreen feature			1
the tablet gets @entity24 , has a 2.2 @entity26 processor and includes a 6.7 megapixel back - facing camera			2
the company says it has upped the screen 's peak brightness so it 's extra visible outdoors in direct sunlight			2
for its new smartphones , @entity1 has chosen to continue its focus on the camera as the killer feature that can set its devices apart			1
its @entity39 smartphone 's primary selling point was its impressive 40 megapixel camera			0
the new big - screen 1520 smartphone will have a smaller but still powerful 20 megapixel camera and cost $ 749 before any carrier subsides			2
the the cheaper 1320 has a more ordinary 5 megapixel camera and cost $ 399			0
the @entity47 app is getting an update across all @entity1 devices			0
six inches is a hefty size for smartphones , but @entity52 , @entity1 's head of product marketing for @entity54 , said the size was key because it 's the largest a phone can go and still be held with one hand			1
while they have n't yet taken off in the @entity59 , " phablet " devices are a bigger hit in developing markets where the larger size is considered a status symbol			0
this is @entity1 's first big product rollout since it was announced that @entity65 was going to purchase part of the company			1
the $ 7.2 billion deal , which will include @entity1 's devices and services businesses , is still pending			1
it 's unclear what kind of different direction @entity1 's products will take when @entity65 is fully in charge , and where the new 2520 tablet will fit in with @entity78 own similar surface line			1
@entity79 is the leading tablet manufacturer in the world , followed by @entity82 , but all the major manufacturers are eager to get in on the growing market			0
though @entity65 has been pushing its own surface tablets and touchscreen - ified operating system , @entity78 8 , it still trails far behind @entity88 and @entity90 tablets			1
@entity1 was once the top mobile phone manufacturer in the world			0
it still holds on to a sizable chunk of the feature phone market , but is struggling to stay competitive against smartphones from @entity79 , @entity82 , and other companies			0
instead of making an @entity90 - based smartphone like most non-apple companies , @entity1 took a bet on a third operating system , @entity78			2
colorful and simple , but with an anemic selection of apps , @entity78 has struggled but slowly grown since making its debut a year ago			0
getting big name apps has been one of the operating systems biggest challenges			0
@entity1 says photo - sharing app @entity107 will finally come to the platform in the next few weeks			2
there is still a market for less advanced phones that can last more than a day on a single battery charge			0
@entity1 also announced three new @entity116 devices on tuesday			2
@entity116 is @entity1 's super simple , very cheap phone line			1
the tiny handsets cost between $ 60 and $ 99 and can make calls and text , run a few apps and even connect to the internet			0
aimed at developing markets , they can also hold a charge for up to a month .			0
