@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , a @entity4 mother , could n't have been more grateful			1
" thank you @entity9 for @entity10 , " she recently told an attorney helping her fill out forms that will protect her from deportation			0
she was referring to temporary protected status , which will allow her to work legally , help @entity4 and support her two young children			1
it 's the sentiment that we hear most these days			0
as longtime advocates , we at @entity15 were gratified when the @entity17 granted temporary protected status to unauthorized @entity4 immigrants after the catastrophic earthquake in @entity4			1
temporary protected status will allow perhaps 100,000 @entity4 to legalize their status for the next 18 months			1
they 'll be able get work permits and driver 's licenses and send more money to loved ones struggling in @entity4 's ruins			1
such people - to - people help is one of the best forms of foreign aid			0
remittances encourage @entity4 to stay and rebuild @entity4 , rather than attempt treacherous sea voyages that more often than not end in tragedy			2
today , @entity15 and other pro bono groups are working furiously to help @entity4 apply for temporary protected status and warn them away from " raket√® , " scammers who will rip them off			1
it 's a mammoth job in @entity1 , home of the nation 's largest @entity4 - born population			1
the six - page temporary protected status application includes complicated questions and must be translated for non-english speakers			1
many @entity4 also need help filling out work - permit and fee - waiver forms			2
without a waiver , applicants ages 14 to 65 must pay $ 470 in fees and $ 50 for a younger child			0
frankly , temporary protected status is the least our government can do after decades of denying @entity4 just immigration treatment			1
no previous administration had granted temporary protected status to @entity4 despite numerous occasions when deportees would have been unsafe due to political conflict or natural disasters , conditions that typically trigger temporary protected status			1
indeed , we had been actively pushing for temporary protected status since four killer storms demolished 15 percent of @entity4 's gross domestic product in late 2008			1
the history of discriminatory treatment goes back much further			0
since @entity4 started coming to @entity71 shores nearly 50 years ago , they routinely have been denied the fundamental protections promised to refugees of virtually every other nationality			2
finally more attention is being paid to the need to help the @entity4			2
as a key neighbor , the @entity71 needs to prepare for a long - term commitment in which @entity71 @entity4 play a key role			2
many of these @entity4 wish to travel to support relatives in @entity4 and contribute to reconstruction			2
but for @entity4 with temporary protected status , those trips could lead to dire consequences			1
though they may travel legally , some may face problems coming back home and , thus , should consult with an attorney before leaving			0
many @entity71 citizen and resident @entity4 also are trying desperately to bring relatives here from @entity4 , but some face daunting delays because of archaic immigration processes			1
given the substantial moral and material help that @entity4 in our country offer @entity4 , @entity17 should find solutions to permit travel and expedite relative reunification			2
we are hopeful , too , that @entity17 will address concerns regarding @entity4 who have arrived here since the earthquake with no or improper visas			2
one glaring example is the dozens of @entity4 who were flown here on military planes after the earthquake , only to be detained			2
many lost their parents , siblings and children ; one of our clients lost his twin 9 - year old daughters			0
virtually all had @entity71 citizen and lawful permanent resident relatives awaiting their release			0
their prolonged detention only exacerbated the terrible trauma they suffered before fleeing @entity4			0
during their detention , most showed signs of depression , anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder			0
yet @entity15 's attempts to get permission for a psychotherapist to meet with the @entity4 were repeatedly rebuffed			2
when everyone in the world was offering to help the @entity4 , @entity136 kept our clients in detention for more than two months			0
they only released them after a front page @entity143 story ran and the @entity4 agreed to be deported whenever @entity136 wants			0
@entity4 orphans also raise tough questions			0
while many caring @entity71 would like to adopt , there is real danger that @entity4 children may be trafficked or improperly separated from their parents			0
for this and other thorny problems , no easy solutions exist in the midst of @entity4 's crisis			1
this crisis in fact has exposed cracks in our deeply fractured immigration system			0
we know @entity4 will not be ready for an influx of deportees when temporary protected status expires in july 2011 or for a long time to come			1
frankly , this country would n't have large populations of immigrants who need temporary protected status if we adjusted immigration flows to meet the real demands of its families and our economy			1
the best solution would be for @entity172 to pass a comprehensive immigration reform that includes a legalization plan and future immigrant flows attuned to the needs of our labor markets			1
the path to legal status should be offered , not only to @entity4 , but also to millions of unauthorized immigrants without criminal records , who pay taxes , raise @entity71 citizen kids and have contributed to their communities for years			1
reform that calibrates incoming immigration flows to labor needs and ensures workers rights would raise wages throughout the @entity71 economy			0
such immigration reform could add $ 1.5 trillion to the nation 's gdp over 10 years , according to a study released in february by the think tanks @entity197 and @entity198			1
clearly , enforcement - only immigration policy is not enough			0
piecemeal fixes have not worked			0
the @entity71 needs a 21st century immigration system that will benefit all @entity71			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			0

@entity204 says giving protected status to @entity4 immigrants was wise
she says such status was not granted in earlier disasters
@entity204 says further immigration changes would aid @entity4 's effort to recover from quake
a comprehensive immigration reform bill would be a major step forward , she says
