-- the separatist group behind a series of bombings on a @entity5 vacation island marks the 50 year anniversary of its struggle this year , a milestone that sees it no closer to achieving its goal			1
police cordon off the route leading to the location of the latest blasts in @entity16			0
@entity17 , which is fighting for the independence of @entity5 's northern @entity20 region , was said to be behind three bombs that detonated on the island of @entity23 on sunday without hurting anyone			1
the latest incident appears to be part of a new wave of attacks , including another in @entity23 which killed two @entity30 officers in july , which have left a 2006 cease - fire a distant memory			1
the violent resurgence also defies @entity5 government claims that the group 's operational capabilities have been broken by a series of high profile arrests in @entity5 and @entity40			2
@entity17 , blamed for more than 800 deaths and listed as a terrorist group by @entity5 the @entity43 and the @entity44 , began campaigning for @entity20 independence in 1959			1
the group , whose full name @entity17 means " @entity17 " in the @entity20 language , killed what some say was its first victim in 1968			1
since then it waged a campaign of violence against the @entity5 state , targeting politicians , policemen , judges and soldiers , often clocking up numerous civilian casualties with deadly car bombs			0
in 1980 alone @entity17 was blamed for 118 deaths , and in 1995 it nearly succeeded in assassinating @entity64 , then leader of the opposition and later @entity5 's prime minister			1
on september 16 , 1998 , the organization declared a " unilateral and indefinite " cease - fire , raising hopes that its campaign was at an end			1
@entity17 called off the cease - fire in november 1999 , however , and 2000 saw a sharp escalation in violence			1
another unilateral cease - fire was declared in march 2005 , with @entity17 raising hopes for a lasting peace by declaring it " permanent			1
" it was called off by @entity17 in june 2006 following numerous more @entity17 attacks			2
at the center of the struggle is a region know as @entity82 in @entity20			2
the area straddles the western end of the @entity85 , covering 20,664 square kilometers in northern @entity5 and southern @entity40			0
see map of territory claimed by @entity20 separatists @entity5 officially recognizes three @entity20 provinces , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			0
a fourth neighboring province , @entity94 , is of @entity20 heritage			0
separatists consider these four provinces plus three in @entity40 -- @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 -- as the @entity20 country , with a population approaching 3 million			0
the area has always possessed a fiercely independent instinct			0
the @entity20 people are the oldest indigenous ethnic group in @entity107 and have lived uninterrupted in the same region since the beginning of recorded history			2
their language , @entity112 , which is spoken regularly by about 40 percent of @entity20 inhabitants , bears no relation to any other @entity116 tongue and dates back to before the @entity117 arrived in @entity5			0
for many centuries the @entity20 of @entity5 enjoyed a strong degree of autonomy			0
the @entity20 region 's hilly landscape helped keep its people isolated from outside influences			0
in the @entity125 , two @entity20 provinces -- @entity91 and @entity126 -- fought against gen. @entity127 , while the provinces of @entity90 and @entity94 fought for @entity127			0
under @entity131 ( 1939 - 75 ) , most of the @entity20 region had its remaining autonomy rescinded			2
its culture , people and language were suppressed			0
@entity17 and its demands for an independent @entity20 state arose in 1959 in the midst of this suppression			1
@entity17 has focused its activities on the @entity5 side of the border			0
for many years @entity40 provided a safe haven for @entity17 members , a situation that began to change in the mid- 1980s			2
the organization has financed its campaign through kidnapping , bank robbery and a so - called " revolutionary tax " on @entity20 businesses -- a payment widely regarded as plain extortion			1
according to the counter-terrorism office of the @entity156 , @entity17 members received training in @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 , while the group also enjoyed close links with the @entity163			2
the good friday peace accord influenced @entity17 to call its cease - fire in 1998 .			1

@entity20 separatist group @entity17 formed in 1959 began violent campaign in 1968
most recent cease - fire *collapsed* in 2007 despite *pledges* of permanence
@entity174 blamed for more than 800 deaths , including many civilians
