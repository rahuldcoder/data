it was the @entity14 of the following year , however , that secured @entity1 ' place in popular mythology			2
held in the @entity36 capital , @entity5 had intended the @entity37 to stand as a testament to the racial superiority of white @entity41 athletes , openly denigrating @entity2 performers as " non-humans			2
" in one of the greatest sporting rebuffs of all time , @entity1 -- one of 18 black athletes on the @entity47 team -- duly won four gold medals in the 100 meters , 200 meters , long jump and 4x100 meters relay			1
his 100 meters time of 10.3 seconds equaled the @entity14 record , while his performances in the 200 meters and long jump -- 20.7 seconds and 8.06 meters respectively -- set new world records			1
the 39.8 seconds recorded by @entity47 4x100 meters team also set a world record , one that stood for 20 years			1

" although i was n't invited to shake hands with @entity5 , " he said , " i was n't invited to the @entity95 to shake hands with the president , either			0
" he failed to attract the endorsements and sponsorship deals enjoyed by white athletes , and was reduced to running exhibition races against dogs and horses to make ends meet			0
