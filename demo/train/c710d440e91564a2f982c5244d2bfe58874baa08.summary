-- @entity3 's resource - rich economy expanded at twice the pace expected by economists in the first quarter of 2012 , lifted by an unexpected increase in household spending and continued heavy investment in mining projects			1
gross domestic product advanced 1.3 per cent from the previous quarter , when it rose a revised 0.6 per cent , according to the @entity12			1
this was well above market expectations of a 0.6 per cent rise and , excluding the quarter that followed the 2011 flooding in @entity18 , was the fastest acceleration in economic growth in five years			1
in annual terms , gdp growth in the year to march was 4.3 per cent			0
the strong reading came a day after the @entity24 lowered its benchmark interest rate to 3.5 per cent -- the lowest level in almost three years -- because of " moderate domestic growth " and a " weaker and more uncertain international environment "			2
wednesday 's report showed capital expenditure in the mining sector up 14 per cent in the first quarter of the year , and the main driver of a 20 per cent increase in private infrastructure investment			2
but it was a 1.6 per cent rise in household spending during the quarter that surprised the market			0
" despite their negativity about a lack of wealth growth and cost of living increases , the consumer is spending money , " said @entity41 economist @entity40			0
treasurer @entity49 hailed the figures as " stunning " and said they showcased the " rock - solid economic fundamentals " that put @entity3 in a " league of its own "			1
" this is a remarkable outcome and reaffirms @entity3 's position as one of the strongest economies in the world , with the @entity61 economy growing faster than every single major advanced economy in the march quarter , " said mr @entity49			1
but economists said the data , which preceded the latest bout of global economic worries , might prove to be the growth peak for @entity3 , and highlighted the unevenness in growth between the mining and non-mining sectors of the economy			1
final demand -- a measure of spending in the local economy by the private and public sectors -- in the mining centres of @entity3 and @entity18 rose 13.6 per cent and 7.8 per cent year - on - year respectively , compared with 2.1 per cent in @entity80 and 1.9 per cent in @entity81			1
" the result is very likely to be the high water mark for growth , with more cautious households , further declines in dwelling activity , and much bleaker offshore conditions , which will be an ongoing drag on export volumes , to compromise growth from here , " said @entity83 economist @entity82			0
" despite the upbeat headline outcome , the picture painted today still is one of an economy not quite firing on all cylinders			0
output from the miners , for example , bounced 2.3 per cent quarter - on - quarter and other industries turned in decent performances			2
manufacturing output , however , dived another 0.8 per cent quarter on quarter ( the sixth decline in the last eight quarters ) " , noted mr @entity82			0
however , the @entity110 rallied following the release of the report , rising 1 per cent to $ 98.40 cents as forecasts for further rate cuts were revised			0
" the market 's expectation for a terminal cash rate around 100 basis points below the current level is not compatible with the resilience of the @entity61 economy , " said @entity116 economist @entity115			0
