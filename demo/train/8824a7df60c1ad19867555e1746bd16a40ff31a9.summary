@entity2 lt. gov. @entity1 is opting out of running for retiring sen. @entity5 's seat , he announced monday in a @entity7 post			1
" it 's always better to be candid than coy			0
while i am humbled by the widespread encouragement of so many and hold in the highest esteem those who serve us in federal office , i know that my head and my heart , my young family 's future , and our unfinished work all remain firmly in the @entity2 --- not @entity19 , " he wrote			2
" therefore i will not seek election to the @entity21 in 2016			0
" @entity5 's retirement sets off wild scramble his decision not to run focuses attention on @entity2 attorney general @entity27 , another @entity2 rising star who 's considered a top contender for the seat if she jumps in			1
both have been developing their statewide and national profiles , and they also share the same @entity2 - based strategists , increasing the likelihood that if one runs for @entity21 , the other would opt out			0

" i am just enjoying this day , thank you , " she said			0
but she wo n't have a walk to the seat if she runs			1
a wide array of potential contenders in both parties have expressed interest in the seat , including billionaire environmentalist @entity58 and , over the weekend , former @entity60 mayor @entity59 , another of the state 's rising @entity63 stars			1
