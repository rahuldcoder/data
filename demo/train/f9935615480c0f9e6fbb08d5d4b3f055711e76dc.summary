-- @entity2 higher education is in the cross hairs of a heated national debate over the value and cost of a college degree			1
yet in @entity13 , our fiercest global economic competitor , the popularity of @entity2 colleges and universities might be at an all - time high			1
i just returned from a trip to @entity16 , where i spoke with @entity18 parents about the value of @entity2 education , where we excel and where we fall short			1
not surprising was the extent to which the @entity18 value education , especially primary and secondary education , and yearn for their children to attend @entity2 universities , and if possible , stay in @entity2			1
when i engaged @entity18 parents about their children , they would often say , " my son ( or daughter ) is going to @entity32 ( or fill in the elite @entity2 university )			1
" i would respond , " @entity34 ! what year is your son or daughter right now ? " and they would say , " three years old			0
" this passion for education starting at such an early age is powerful			0
after meeting with @entity18 teachers , parents and children , three differences were immediately clear			2
first , their children are better educated than @entity2 children in the @entity48 -- science , technology , engineering and math. high standards and high expectations are the norm in @entity13 , not the exception , as is often the case in the @entity2			1
second , @entity18 parents will sacrifice almost anything for their child 's education			0
they realize firsthand , " history is a race between education and catastrophe , " as @entity66 put it			0
in @entity13 , the disposable income of middle - class families is more likely to be spent on education than leisure or entertainment			2
third , to the @entity18 people , @entity2 universities , for all their shortcomings and blemishes , are still beacons of freedom , individualism and self - improvement			1
to them , our universities are emblems of the highest achievement			0
in @entity85 , they have a saying : " the protruding nail gets hammered down			0
" in @entity2 , we give awards for protruding nails			0
our standards should be higher and our achievement better , but we still remain a land of unlimited opportunity			0
each of my speeches in @entity13 began by reminding the @entity18 people of the three , quintessential @entity2 values engraved , on our currency : @entity101 , @entity100			1
politically , we may be at odds with the @entity18 regime , but its people desperately long for a taste of @entity2 autonomy			2
@entity13 , the private international education company that invited me to @entity13 and for which i am a compensated senior adviser , focuses on teaching idiomatic @entity111 to @entity18 students to help them get into @entity2 universities			1
it also helps @entity18 students develop confidence , initiative , commitment and active learning -- all qualities that are cherished by our higher institutions			1
as a result , the number of @entity18 undergraduate students in the @entity2 has doubled in the past two years			2
in the 2006 - 07 academic year , 9,955 @entity18 undergraduates enrolled in @entity2 schools			2
the next year , that figure jumped to 16,450 , and by 2010 - 11 , 56,976 undergraduates enrolled in the @entity2 @entity13 exports more of its students to the @entity2 than to any other country			1
they are already reaping the benefits educationally and economically			0
in february 2011 , in a meeting with @entity133 's biggest entrepreneurs , president @entity130 asked @entity134 of @entity135 what it would take to make @entity138 in the @entity2 rather than @entity13			2
@entity134 replied that those jobs are n't coming back			0
the @entity140 reported it this way : " @entity135 executives believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility , diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their @entity2 counterparts that " made in the @entity2 " is no longer a viable option for most @entity135 products			0
" the @entity18 realize the potential of @entity2 universities when engaged properly			1
when a student approaches the university with a specific degree focus , applies it with diligence and finances it soundly , understanding the commitment he or she is making , the @entity2 university system is still the best in the world			0
@entity2 students must begin approaching their higher education just as smartly and seriously , or our academies will be filled with aspiring and inquiring minds from elsewhere			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			0

@entity172 : many @entity18 yearn to send their children to @entity2 universities
@entity172 : @entity18 students better prepared in science , math ; parental expectations higher
in @entity13 , @entity2 colleges represent freedom , individualism , self - improvement , he says
he warns that @entity2 must approach education as focused as the @entity18
