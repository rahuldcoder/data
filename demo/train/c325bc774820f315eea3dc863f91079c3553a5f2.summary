-- ultimately , it 's about power			0
when @entity6 president @entity5 suspended an agreement with the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) on november 21 , his personal considerations would certainly have been a driving factor			1
signing the agreement would not only have brought @entity6 much closer to its @entity12 neighbors			2
it would also have made its political sphere more democratic and competitive and its economy more transparent -- outcomes that would have been unlikely to fit with @entity5 's personal interests			1
read more : @entity19 calls for stability and order what the @entity8 did in the past with its enlargement policy , and what it is trying now to replicate with its " @entity26 " , is to use its economic power as a tool to push neighboring countries towards liberal democracy			1
the more these countries -- among them @entity6 , @entity32 , and @entity33 -- move towards rule of law , democracy and a market economy , the more access they have to the @entity8 market , and the easier it is for their people to travel and work in the @entity8			1
but the project to transform @entity6 's political and economic structures is unlikely to please @entity5			1
allegations that his party had rigged voting in 2004 triggered the " @entity50 , " forcing him from office and giving power to his political opponents , including @entity55 , who became prime minister			0
soon after @entity5 was elected president in 2010 , @entity55 was jailed after being found guilty of abuse of office , in a case many believe was politically motivated			0
in its negotiations , the @entity8 had been demanding that @entity5 free @entity55			2
@entity6 is seen as a deeply corrupt country , ranked number 144 out of 177 countries in the @entity65			2
this environment provides a breeding ground for arbitrary rule by powerful clans			0
a rapprochement with the @entity8 would , at least on longer term , put pressure on that rule			2
another reason to put the agreement with the @entity8 on hold seems to have been the @entity19 factor			1
read more : opinion -- why @entity6 's future lies with the @entity8 @entity19 president @entity79 wants to bring the @entity6 into his sphere of influence through integration into a @entity84 - led customs union which in the future shall be transformed into a fully - fledged " @entity86			1
" in the past few months , the @entity87 has put considerable pressure on @entity6 to move over to this camp			1
but for @entity5 , an alliance with @entity19 would be a double - edged sword			0
while @entity79 is likely to give the @entity6 leader a free hand to consolidate his power base , he would also want control over key economic and political decisions			2
in a close alliance , @entity6 would lose core elements of sovereignty			0
if @entity5 were to hand his country over to @entity84 , he would very likely be met with another revolution			0
since the @entity50 in 2004 , @entity6 's political class has been aware that it needs to stay in tune with popular opinion			1
and a clear majority wants to go @entity12			0
people see a prosperous , well - governed @entity8 next to their borders -- in sharp contrast with their own economic and political misery			2
that 's why they are on the streets now , in @entity112 and elsewhere			2
@entity5 , however , is likely to try to keep @entity6 in the middle -- going neither @entity12 nor @entity114			0
he wants to keep the status quo , where he feels safe			0
but the economic crisis is getting worse , and he needs help			0
without a rapprochement , neither the @entity8 nor @entity19 will invest substantially in his regime			1
read more : opinion -- beware @entity19 's power play and there is a new factor which may bring additional dynamism into the game			2
@entity126 , now seen by many as the leading power in @entity129 , has recently put its weight behind the @entity26 -- which had mainly been driven by @entity131 and @entity132 in the past			1
in a speech on november 18 , @entity126 chancellor @entity134 flatly rejected @entity19 's claims over the region			1
eastern @entity142 countries , she said , " must decide themselves on their future direction			0
" " third parties " -- ie @entity19 -- " can not have the right to veto , " she said			0
@entity145 would urge the @entity8 to counter @entity19 pressure on @entity129 , " be it in the form of additional sales opportunities for products from our partner countries , which for instance may not be exported to @entity19 , or in the form of assistance to diversify their energy supply , " @entity134 said			1
this is quite a turnaround in @entity126 policies towards @entity19			1
it is the first time @entity134 has spoken to @entity84 with the assertive attitude of the leader of a great power			0
and she was doing what great powers usually do : pushing back other great powers and offering protection to smaller powers			0
in other words , @entity134 took a first step towards a geopolitical competition with @entity19 over @entity129 -- effectively ending years of cozy bilateral relations with @entity84			1
@entity134 has picked up the gauntlet thrown by @entity79 at her and the @entity8			0
but it is still unclear to what extent she will follow - up her rhetoric and push the @entity8 towards making more substantial offers to @entity6 -- especially after the hopes of signing an agreement at the @entity180 summit have been disappointed			1
but she has shown a @entity126 that no longer afraid to confront @entity19 over @entity129			1
this is starting to look like an entirely new game			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

thousands have been *protesting* in @entity112 after the @entity6 government rejected an @entity8 deal
the deal would have made @entity6 's political sphere more democratic , @entity185 says
but he says it was not in the president 's own interests to sign and move away from @entity19
@entity126 has shown it is not afraid to confront @entity19 over @entity129 , @entity185 says
