@entity0 -- the @entity2 , which is slated for repairs after it was damaged in an earthquake last year , appears to be sinking , according to preliminary data collected by the @entity6			1
@entity6 surveyors and the @entity8 are investigating whether the august 23 , 2011 , earthquake caused the 555 - foot stone obelisk to sink or shift			1
" our initial observations show a difference of around 2 millimeters at several of the survey markers in the vicinity of the monument , " @entity11 told @entity1			2
the @entity2 was last surveyed in 2009			2
since its completion in 1884 , data shows it has sunk nearly 2 inches			1
the monument , the tallest structure in the nation 's capital , has been closed since the magnitude 5.8 quake struck the @entity26 near @entity27 , @entity28			1
the earthquake may be responsible for the monument to have sunk 1 millimeter , while the other millimeter may be a result of normal settling , according to @entity11			1
" it will still take some time to apply the proper corrections for atmospheric conditions ... to this data and perform a full analysis once the entire survey is completed -- hopefully by the end of next week , " @entity11 said			0
the @entity6 is expanding the scope of its study to determine whether other national monuments are slipping back into the swampland upon which the nation 's capital was built			1
" the survey plans are being expanded to include observations around the tidal basin to the @entity49 and @entity50 , as well as other areas along the @entity52 , including the @entity55 's @entity54 building , the @entity56 , and eastward to @entity57 , " an @entity6 statement said			2
experts are still trying to figure out the best way to address damage found both inside and along the exterior of the @entity2 , including whether an outside scaffold will be needed			0
last fall , structural engineers documenting the impact of the earthquake used a system of ropes and slings to scale all four faces of the structure from top to bottom			0
@entity73 , co-founder of the investment firm @entity74 , has donated $ 7.5 million toward the repair project			0
with @entity73 's donation and congressional funds that were approved in december , deputy interior secretary @entity76 said in january there was enough money to begin the repairs			0
the project should start this summer or early fall , and should take about a year , @entity76 said .			0
