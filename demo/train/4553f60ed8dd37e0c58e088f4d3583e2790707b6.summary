-- history was made on two fronts when @entity3 beat @entity4 to win the @entity5			1
while @entity3 celebrated becoming the first @entity7 man to claim an @entity9 title , @entity4 was n't nearly as joyous			1
he slumped to 0 - 9 in finals to tie the unwanted men 's record in the @entity5 era , which began in 1968			1
is he tennis ' unlucky loser ? @entity4 's fellow @entity16 , @entity17 , and @entity19 @entity18 also lost their first nine finals , although @entity17 went on to triumph five times -- he was a two - time grand slam finalist -- and @entity18 ended his drought in @entity25 in 1982			1
no man has lost his first 10 finals in the @entity5 era , said the @entity9			1
@entity4 was so close to overturning his woe in finals , too , holding a match point in the second set sunday against @entity3			1
he did little wrong on the point , approaching the net with a good forehand , but @entity3 unleashed a stunning forehand down the line			2
@entity4 then wasted a flurry of break points in the final set and fell 2 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 4			1
@entity16 sports daily @entity40 used the headline , ' @entity4 , nothing new , ' when referring to his defeat on its website , and the player tweeted a picture of what looked like a beer accompanied by the words : ' to forget			0
' " i tried everything today , " @entity4 , 31 , told the @entity9 's website			1
" i played very well , particularly i was very aggressive and i did n't let him play for two sets almost			0
i had match point and i played the point perfectly			1
" it 's hard , it 's very hard			0
i was leading the match , but this is tennis			0
" @entity3 could n't stop smiling during the trophy presentation but spared a thought for @entity4			2
" i knew ( about @entity4 's previous finals ) , " he told the @entity9 's website			1
" i feel bad for him			0
" that @entity3 , 24 , trumped compatriots @entity63 and @entity64 by winning a title came as a surprise , since @entity63 was a top prospect reared at @entity69 's famed academy in @entity70 and @entity64 once ranked sixth as a junior			2
but @entity3 , mentored by @entity73 's part - time coach @entity72 , entered @entity74 in good form , reaching the semifinals in @entity77			1
he upset top - seed @entity78 en route to the final in @entity74 and is now @entity82 's highest - ranked player at no. 51			2
" people can start to know @entity7 tennis and i think that 's great , " said @entity3			2
top two in @entity87 @entity73 will almost certainly reclaim the no. 1 ranking from @entity89 during the @entity91 swing and both see action tuesday at the @entity94			1
@entity89 meets @entity73 's conqueror at @entity96 in 2012 , @entity97 , and @entity73 faces @entity99 @entity98			2
@entity100 was among the winners on the opening day of competition in @entity87 as he beat @entity105 @entity104 in straight sets			0
fellow @entity108 @entity107 also advanced after seeing off @entity110 's @entity109			0
in the women 's tournament , @entity105 's @entity111 knocked out @entity116 second seed @entity114			0
the momentum swung between the two players but it was @entity111 who won the decisive third set , taking the last two games to love to claim a 6 - 4 2 - 6 6 - 4 win			0
" it was an awful match and a very bad performance from me , so there 's not much to say about it , " said @entity125 runner - up @entity114			0
" i do n't feel like i was ready to play - the preparation was n't enough , i can not deny that			0
it 's my mistake for not paying enough attention after the @entity19			0
open how i managed my time and managed my health			0
