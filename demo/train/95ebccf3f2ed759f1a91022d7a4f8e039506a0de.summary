i enjoyed having tea with @entity2 one sunday afternoon recently			2
it felt like visiting an elderly relative in my native @entity5 , except that the 78 - year - old widow lives in a cramped prefabricated housing complex about 37 miles ( 60 kilometers ) from the crippled @entity9 nuclear plant in north - eastern @entity10			1
she was one of thousands of people displaced by the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck the region last march			1
like other survivors , her family moved in to temporary housing , where the @entity18 helped them to settle in with a package of household electrical appliances including a rice cooker , tv and refrigerator			1
i had visited her twice before during my work with the @entity18 , which had taken me to @entity10 five times since the disaster			1
in the week that followed the massive earthquake , i was based in the busy @entity10 @entity18 office in @entity30 dealing with the huge number of requests for information from the international media			1
the questions followed a familiar pattern : what were the main needs ? was the situation improving ? how were people coping with the nuclear danger ? each day i relayed reports from @entity10 @entity18 president @entity43 , who was out in the worst affected areas assessing the situation			1
he described what he was seeing as comparable to the flattened ruins of @entity49 and @entity30 during @entity50 but amid the chaos , i recognized that the elderly were perhaps the most vulnerable and needed constant support to prevent them from being isolated and neglected in the aftermath			1
it was during my third trip to @entity10 that i first met @entity57 at her temporary housing complex			1
she had recently visited the home she had been evacuated from , which was inside the mandatory 12 - mile ( 20 - kilometer ) exclusion zone that surrounds the quake - damaged @entity9 nuclear plant			1
journey inside @entity10 's nuclear exclusion zone she told me how she managed to retrieve a photograph of her husband , who died just months before the tsunami , ad well as his spirit tablet -- common sight in homes in many @entity74 countries as a place where the spirits of ancestors reside			1
it was a moving sight as she lit a stick of incense and bowed before his portrait			2
when i visited her again in january it was heartening to see her in more cheerful spirits			2
she had been keeping herself busy making elephants out of toweling , part of a community project set up by a local non-profit organization			2
yet it soon became clear that life for her remained full of ups and downs			2
in october , she , her daughter and grandson were allowed another visit to their old home			2
living with the aftermath of @entity10 's tsunami nightmare " i felt very disappointed , " she recalled			1
" the grass had grown so long around the family home , a herd of cows nearby was running wild and it was very sad to see them			2
" despite @entity109 's initial cheerfulness , the emotional strain began to show and she broke down in tears			0
she said she missed life in her village			0
" i was born there and married someone from only four kilometers away and spent my whole life there , " she said			0
however her daughter remains stoical			0
" sometimes i tell myself that i must stop thinking of myself as a disaster survivor or victim , " she said			0
witness to disaster : @entity10 's tsunami further north , in the coastal town of @entity124 , @entity125 paced over the concrete foundations that are all that remain of the house where he grew up until the age of 18			1
" it still does n't seem real ; i can hardly believe this has happened , " he said			0
his grandmother lost her life when the tsunami swept in			1
" she was in the house by herself , because my mother had just gone up the hill to renew her driving license , " he recalled			0
as @entity125 stood in the road in front of the empty space where his house once stood , he showed me a photograph of himself age 20 , together with three of his best friends , all dark suited , at their coming of age day celebration to mark the legal passage into adulthood -- when young adults can do things like vote and purchase alcohol			0
" the guy on the right lost his mother and sister , the guy on the left 's father and elder brother are still missing , " he said			0
@entity125 explained that the fourth member of the group died in a car accident eight years ago			0
" his grave has been washed away			0
" in the nearby town of @entity170 , where the @entity10 @entity18 is handing over six school buses to local schools , we sit down with a couple of students from a local school			1
the two 13 - year olds radiate a calmness and cheerfulness that 's reassuring in kids so young			2
a local education department official told me that parents here are still suffering from stress as a result of the disaster , and are passing on this unease to their children			0
when i asked @entity189 and @entity190 about their parents , @entity189 said his father has a job provided by the local government in an oyster fishing cooperative			0
but he said his father remains anxious about when the authorities will make a decision on the location of new permanent homes			0
nobody seems to have a clear idea how long they will have to spend in the temporary housing and many of the decisions on reconstruction have yet to be taken			1
@entity208 said it is difficult getting a proper night 's sleep in the temporary housing			1
" you can hear people snoring and shutting doors in the nearby houses , " he said			0
but what are the two youngsters ' hopes for 2012 ? " i just hope there will be no more earthquakes , " said @entity208			0
" i hope that more shops will open in our town so it will gradually be a bit brighter , " added @entity189 .			0

@entity227 worked for the @entity228 in @entity10 after the march 11 earthquake and tsunami
recognized the elderly were perhaps the most vulnerable of the survivors
many had been evacuated from area around quake - damaged @entity9 nuclear plant
much *frustration* over when they will be able to move from temporary housing complexes
