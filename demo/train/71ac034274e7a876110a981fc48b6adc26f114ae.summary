-- @entity2 's post-title hangover continued on sunday after a 1 - 0 defeat that kept @entity4 in pole position for @entity8 's third @entity7 place next season			1
@entity10 netted the only goal in the 86th minute before the game erupted from its previous lethargy as @entity2 defender @entity14 was sent off for kicking out at fellow @entity16 @entity15			1
television replays showed the @entity4 player smiling on the floor afterwards			2
it was @entity2 's first red card this season , and means @entity14 will miss the rest of the @entity25 campaign with an automatic three - game ban			1
" the referee was bought by the fact @entity15 rolled about , " @entity2 manager @entity27 said			1
" he actually elbowed @entity14 twice but you know what happens when a player retaliates : he 's always punished more			1
" @entity15 made it look worse			2
i do n't think the referee saw it , actually , and he was convinced by @entity15 's reaction			2
" the defeat followed @entity2 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity39 last weekend , having previously wrapped up a record - extending 20th title with four matches to play			1
" maybe this will waken the players up , " said @entity27 , ahead of next weekend 's final home match this season against @entity44			0
" there was no edge to our game but i think @entity4 were the better team			2
training was fine this week and there was a nice edge to it , but today it was missing			0
it 's been a long season for the players and their final really big effort was last week against @entity39			0
" @entity10 scored his 11th league goal this season , and 19th overall , to put @entity4 a point clear of fourth - placed @entity39 and three ahead of @entity63 in fifth			1
victory in wednesday 's home clash with @entity63 would virtually ensure qualification for @entity69 's top club competition , given their @entity72 rivals ' inferior goal difference			1
" if we can win we will be there , but @entity63 are a good team and it will be a final for the top four , " said manager @entity73 , who has guided @entity4 to two wins over @entity2 since taking charge in december			1
" this game was difficult and important for us			0
wednesday will be even more important as we are so close to them			0
winning is crucial for us , it 's even more important for them , so there will be a great atmosphere at @entity84			0
" @entity73 is hoping to have @entity85 available after the @entity87 playmaker missed the trip to @entity89 due to a calf injury			0
" the physios are working with him and he could be fit , " said the @entity91 , whose team have played 12 games in just 37 days , reaching the final of the @entity95			0
@entity99 's chances of playing in @entity69 's second - tier tournament next season suffered a blow in sunday 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity105 rivals @entity104			1
manager @entity106 was angry that @entity108 's second - half header was ruled out for a foul by teammate @entity110 on home goalkeeper @entity111			2
" it was a goal			0
the goalkeeper runs into our player so the goal should stand , " said @entity106 after his sixth - placed team dropped five points behind @entity63 , having played one more game			2
" if we run into the goalkeeper then give a foul for that , but he ran into us , so it was a goal			0
" @entity104 , in the absence of suspended top scorer @entity123 , stayed seventh .			0

@entity10 's late winner returns @entity4 to third place in @entity25
@entity2 's @entity14 sent off after *tussling* with *compatriot* @entity15
@entity4 can *clinch* @entity7 place by *beating* @entity63 on wednesday
@entity99 's @entity132 chances slump following 0 - 0 draw in derby at @entity104
