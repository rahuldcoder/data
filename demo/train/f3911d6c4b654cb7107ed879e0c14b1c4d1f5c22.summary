" as for @entity51 , i can say that he is very good at his job , " said the @entity2 president , " but we also managed to win eight constructors ' titles in the last 13 championships without him : i have huge faith in our own engineers			0
" @entity18 also revealed he will be meeting @entity16 to discuss his future with the team			2
@entity16 , who took fourth at the @entity15 , finished second at the recent @entity62 @entity15 , his first podium finish in two years			0

" we also have the best driver in @entity21 and i 'm happy to see @entity16 back at a high level			0
