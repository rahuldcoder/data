@entity0 , @entity1 -- this old @entity4 city is still waking up when the first members drift into the church basement			1
they turn on the lights , pull metal chairs across the wooden floor and settle in with paper cups of coffee and the weight of the week			2
there 's work or not enough work			1
tonight 's dinner and tomorrow 's , too			1
parents in prison , neighbors just getting out			2
kids who want some faraway , high - cost college and kids who do n't want to get out of bed on sundays			2
then there 's money -- always , forever money -- to think about			1
they 've heard weekly sermons about how to plan , overcome and grow , but the lessons really start to apply in bible study , like today , when they 'll pore over a line and relate it back to the messy , wonderful business of living			2
worry is nothing new for the congregation at @entity39 , which is well into its third century and one of the oldest black congregations in the @entity42			1
but this is a loving congregation , they say , and always the type to take action when times are hard			0
of course they will feed the hungry , clothe the naked and teach the young , but they also want to preserve their space			0
members say it was the first brick structure in @entity1 that was built , used and owned by black people , that it 's their own living history of slavery , civil rights and freedom			1
it 's just so much			1
" this is not new for us , " says @entity59 , a lifetime member and 7 a.m. bible study regular			0
" there 's just more needs			1
" so , with darkness pouring in the windows and a long day still ahead , the rev. @entity65 sits in his folding chair and reminds his followers of the @entity71 passage he repeats most , from the book of @entity73 : " but seek first the kingdom of @entity75 and his righteousness , and all these things shall be added to you			0
" as they all know , it has worked for this congregation before			0
faith first , then freedom more than 150 years ago , slaves built this church by fire and moonlight			1
they raised the walls with clay and sand blocks known as @entity90 , and a white ceiling patterned after a nine - patch quilt , a symbol of safety from slavery			0
after the first bible study of the day , @entity96 explains this to a small tour group seated in the church 's curved oak pews			1
he was baptized in @entity39 's chilly pool at age 7 and began giving tours as a teen			1
he 's 22 now , one semester shy of graduation from @entity107			1
he learned the church 's history through a thousand sermons and older members ' memories			1
several times a week , he leads tours of each level , and shares everything he knows			0
he talks about the earliest church leaders , who were whipped and harassed by white residents who balked at the idea of a black preacher			1
he tells of schisms that divided the flourishing black congregation			1
he explains that in the 1830s , a white congregation planned to move to a new location , and offered its land and an aging wooden building to @entity39			1
the price was $ 1,500			0
most of the church members were slaves , whose labor fueled @entity0 's agriculture and shipping economy			1
but many could earn money of their own by working after - hours or taking odd jobs			0
some could save enough to buy freedom for themselves and their families			0
so , they faced a choice , @entity96 says : use money saved to free themselves , or pool their funds to purchase a church for all			2
he imagines that they read the line from @entity73 , about seeking @entity75 's kingdom first ; he knows that within a few months , they came up with the money , and the church was theirs			1
but the building was already deteriorating when @entity153 moved in			0
by the 1850s , @entity0 was a growing city of 14,000 free residents and 7,000 slaves			1
the pastor championed a new structure , one made of brick , one made to last			0
this very building , @entity96 says			0
he points out the handiwork of members who toiled through the night from 1855 to 1859			1
they designed a tall sanctuary , balcony seating and pews with ancient @entity39 languages carved into the sides			1
perhaps their best plan was mostly out of view , @entity96 explains as he leads visitors down stairs and into the basement			0
beneath the wooden floor , builders left a space four feet tall , large enough to hide hundreds of slaves following the @entity180 to freedom			2
they punctured holes in the floor in the cross-and - diamond shape of an @entity39 prayer symbol , the @entity182 , and publicly worshipped its ancient meaning			1
quietly , underneath , runaways worshipped the light and air the symbols allowed			0
" you 're talking about working 12 to 16 hours , then turning around to come build a church at nighttime and going back to work on fields after that , " he tells the tour group			2
" if i can say so , that 's a lot of hard work , and a lot of dedication to the task at hand			2
" most of the builders were still enslaved after the church doors opened , but freedom came to them a few years later , anyway , through the @entity209			2
@entity96 repeats the passage from @entity73 again , " all things shall be added			0
" " that was no coincidence , " he tells the crowd			0
the pastor interrupts the tour to invite the guests to stay			0
there 's another bible study at noon , and everyone is welcome here			2
rebuilding the church " do we see ourselves as programmers , or do we see ourselves as builders ? " the pastor asks			2
it 's time for the evening bible study , and the crowd has outgrown the basement			2
they 're sitting in pews in business suits and blue jeans ; @entity65 is in the same suit he started the day in 12 hours before			0
they murmur the question , wondering what trick he has thrown at them			0
he asks again : programmers , doing service as a thoughtless habit ? or builders , serving to edify their church and its mission in the community ? since @entity65 took over in 1982 , he has simplified how people worship			2
he encouraged members to decentralize ministries and take the lessons from church into their everyday lives			1
he wants them to consider the community 's needs and use their talents to serve the church , whether they 're passing out water at football games , teaching a seminar about financial planning or leading a church tour			1
this will never be a church that has to look far for service projects , @entity65 says			2
he needs only look at their building			0
it needs a kitchen ; the old one was removed to make wheelchair - accessible bathrooms			0
they want to replace the steeple with a 100 - foot replica of the original , which was knocked down by a hurricane about a century ago			0
they want to rip the stucco off the exterior and preserve those old gray bricks , then build a museum out back to teach thousands of visitors who take their tour every year			0
it will cost millions , and nobody wants to spend a dime till they can do it without debt			0
in @entity0 , a city where history now drives much of the economy , they 're likely to get community support			1
still , @entity39 - @entity42 spaces have long fallen behind others			1
where there are well - preserved plantation mansions , slave quarters are often long gone			0
aging churches all over the country are at risk , too -- there will always be other worries and other causes that need to be funded first			2
but there 's no ignoring history , and especially faith , the pastor believes			1
" just the fact that we 're in this building is a constant reminder of where @entity75 has blessed us , " @entity65 says			0
" those who were enslaved were able to build a sanctuary , an edifice like this , that 's built four - brick deep , that 's meant to stand for the ages -- surely we can keep it up			1
surely , we can do other great and wonderful things in this day and time , regardless of how the economic times are			0
" we are builders , he tells the congregation , and builders must have plans .			0

@entity0 's @entity39 is one of the oldest black churches in the @entity42
early members , mostly slaves , built the church from 1855 to 1859
current members consider history when facing trouble
