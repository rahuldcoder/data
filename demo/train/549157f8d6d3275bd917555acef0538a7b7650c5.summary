@entity1 's days are filled with the same struggles as any dad 's : he 's looking for a job , trying to explain the world to his 6 - year - old daughter and still get a decent night 's sleep			1
but he 's doing it on his own			2
the 36 - year - old penned the @entity12 best - seller " two kisses for @entity14 " about his journey into fatherhood with his daughter @entity17 , known as @entity14 , after his wife , @entity18 , died from a pulmonary embolism less than a day after giving birth in 2008			1
@entity14 " has taught me to let go of a lot of things and get lost in that moment , " said @entity1 , co-author of the forthcoming picture book " @entity22 ... , " which will be published by @entity24 in june 2016			1
" i 'm lucky ; i hate that @entity18 is gone , but i feel lucky that i 'm here with @entity14 because she 's a wonderful little kid			1
" he 's running one of the 2.6 million households headed by a single father in the @entity30 , according to a 2011 analysis by the @entity32 , and part of a growing number of stay - at - home dads			1
an analysis released this month by @entity32 found that the number of dads who stay at home has nearly doubled from 1.1 million in 1989			0
while much of that number is due to illness and disability ( 35 % ) or unemployment ( 23 % ) , the study found the " biggest contributor to the long - term growth " of stay - at - home dads are those who stay home to care for home and family -- 21 % in 2012 compared to 5 % in 1989			2
despite the growth , there are significant trials -- and triumphs -- in being a single dad and a stay - at - home dad in a country where it 's not the norm			1
here 's @entity1 's take on what he 's learned from fatherhood ; the interview has been edited for clarity and brevity			1
@entity67 : what 's the typical reaction to your current lifestyle ? @entity1 : i get praised for so much because i 'm a dad doing what a mom does			1
if i post a photo of my kid walking down the street with a smile , somebody will usually comment , " you 're giving your child the best life ! " this is one single moment ; you have no idea if i 'm cooking meth in my bathtub			2
yet , i 'm getting praised for having my child smile in the photo			0
it 's always nice to hear nice things , but my kid is no different than anybody else 's			2
i get so much more credit than i deserve as a single dad			2
i do n't believe there is a motherly instinct , i believe there is a humanly instinct			0
the complicated and common world of single parenthood @entity67 : so , you think there are misconceptions about single and / or stay - at - home dads ? @entity1 : people still look at people sideways who give that answer			1
right now , as i 'm trying to find a job , there 's a 4Â½ - year gap in my resume			1
there are all these assumptions that i 've been sitting at home watching " @entity114 " -- which does happen -- but i am a busy person			0
the level of acceptance is n't there yet			0
there are a lot of reasons that fathers have that reputation ; they 're often portrayed as bumbling idiots in media			0
i know a few single dads who are stay - at - home dads who are n't work - at - home dads , and people still think that they 're just lazy			1
@entity67 : when asked , how do you define what you do ? @entity1 : i wear so many different hats			1
i do n't like to call myself an author -- i find it so pretentious			0
one time i built a retaining wall in my backyard , but i 'm not a stonemason			0
at this point , i 'm struggling with that identity			0
i , of course , consider myself a dad , but i do n't want to be defined by that			0
i see the @entity143 profiles that describe the person as " husband of , " " wife to , " " parent of " and i do n't want to have that -- i do n't want to be defined by one thing			1
@entity67 : take us back to that day when you got the title of " dad " -- and the day that everything changed			2
were you worried about fulfilling two roles instead of one ? @entity1 : i lost my partner and my best friend , but i also lost a mother , a female influence that was going to be the guiding force in @entity17 's life			1
i thought " how am i going to take her to the store one day and buy a training bra ? i do n't even know what the f -- k a training bra is			2
" there were those obvious concerns , like describing a menstrual cycle with what i learned about it in high school			0
i looked more at the differences of me as a man and this potential young woman , instead of finding the commonalities			0
i was used to my brothers making pipe bombs and blowing up mailboxes ; i was used to that kind of world			0
i had all these assumptions of how i should raise a daughter			0
@entity67 : what do you wish someone had told you as you began your journey into fatherhood ? @entity1 : to not assume too much			1
i assumed so much about who my daughter was going to be			0
to not assume how my child was going to turn out because of the way she was born			0
i was worried about the lack of a female influence in her life			0
i worried so much about screwing her up , but i 'm not her sole influence			0
she 's got a lot of people in her world that help shape her			2
knowing that would 've taken so much pressure off of me			0
the bravest man i know @entity67 : a little role reversal here -- what has @entity14 taught you on your journey ? @entity1 : so , i was super proud that i learned how to braid her hair , but recently , she decided she wanted to get her hair cut my length			1
i went to talk to her about how people might receive it			0
i was worried about how she was going to feel and if someone would hurt her feelings ; i got her prepared for the sh - t people are going to say			2
she just looked at me with a grin , " i do n't care			0
" kids are just so great about being unconcerned -- to have that level of confidence ! that 's such a cool lesson to see this kid who is 6 years old and does n't care that people might think she 's a boy			0
i do n't have to let the world know that i have a daughter ; it 's a really cool way to live			0
@entity67 : you 've had some choice words about @entity241 , specifically that it 's " a bullsh - t holiday created to help sell greeting cards and grills and ties and other garbage			1
" has your view changed ? @entity1 : it 's basically any other day			1
i think @entity241 is a bigger deal if you have someone around to make it a big deal			2
@entity241 can be where the kid finally draws the dad a picture or makes pottery that says " no. 1 @entity22 ! " -- and that 's needed in a different relationship			1
@entity241 is a bigger deal for some people , and it would be if i had a wife around that did most of the household stuff			1
i hate even saying this , but every day is @entity241			1
every picture @entity14 draws is for me			2
i get to sit and talk to her and get her full attention at dinner			0
all the stuff that fathers typically do on @entity241 , we do that every single day			1
