-- today 's world is more interconnected than ever , making the transmission of communicable diseases that originate abroad easier to reach our shores			0
and the ongoing @entity7 outbreak is simply the latest unsettling reminder that all the benefits of an interconnected world also come with significant risks that must be addressed and mitigated			1
this @entity7 outbreak likely began with a 2 - year - old in the rain forest of @entity16 © dou , @entity17 , and it has now reached halfway around the world to @entity19 , @entity20 , where this terrible disease claimed its first victim in the @entity23 , @entity22 , last wednesday			1
we have the ability to prevent a significant outbreak of the virus here in the @entity23 , but president @entity29 must act much more quickly and effectively if we are going to combat the disease at its source , and thus hinder further overseas transmission and ultimately prevent the spread of the disease outside @entity35			1
this challenge will only be made more difficult because many @entity23 lack confidence in our government 's ability to effectively confront crises like this one			1
beginning with the first case in @entity17 last december , the response to the @entity7 outbreak by the international community has been slow and inadequate			1
local health systems , which were weak at best , have been completely devastated as many health workers became victims of this deadly virus			0
the @entity23 initially stood back and allowed the global response to be led by the @entity51 , which failed to combat @entity7 in its earliest stages			1
as a result , @entity7 ballooned from a local problem to a regional problem , and now to a global problem			2
the @entity23 is the country best equipped with the resources and power to tackle the medical and logistical nightmare that the @entity7 epidemic has become			1
with over 8,000 people infected , more than 4,000 dead and infection rates increasing , this outbreak of @entity7 is not going to go away quickly			2
yet while we need a more effective and rapid response to contain the outbreak in @entity35 , we also need to make sure sufficient safeguards are in place to protect @entity23			1
we have to make sure that every aspect of our federal government 's response -- from our passenger screening efforts to our public health system -- is effectively prepared to prevent the spread of @entity7			1
to that end , the @entity23 must take several steps to strengthen our response to this challenge			2
first , @entity23 need to have some reassurance that someone in our country is in charge of confronting this epidemic and keeping @entity23 safe from it			1
so far , inexcusably , this has not really happened			0
president @entity29 should publicly designate a senior government official to lead a task force			0
this person would be in charge of coordinating the @entity23 response to this crisis , both domestically and internationally , including our military presence , which in a limited amount of time has already had a real impact on the ground in @entity99			2
second , we need to target the problem at the source			0
containing the outbreak in @entity99 , @entity17 and @entity103 is the right thing to do for humanitarian reasons , but it 's also essential to protecting the @entity23 people			1
the longer the outbreak lasts in those countries , the greater the chance of the disease being transmitted to other countries , including the @entity23			1
as part of the response abroad , we need to bolster public health systems in the region to help prevent the virus from expanding across more borders			0
third , we need to prevent the growing crisis in @entity35 from leading to more cases in the @entity23			1
the recent announcement of increased entry screening of those traveling from affected countries by @entity125 and @entity126 at select points of entry in the @entity23 is a good but , frankly , overdue first step			2
however , it will not be enough , and the @entity131 should institute a temporary ban on new visas to non- @entity23 nationals seeking to travel to the @entity23 from @entity99 , @entity103 and @entity17			2
since march 1 , 2014 , over 6,000 visas have been issued to nationals of these countries			0
foreign health workers coming to the @entity23 to be trained should be exempted , provided they pass screening efforts			2
however , until we have a better handle on the problem , we need to prevent mass travel from the countries most affected			0
we should also ensure that @entity125 and @entity126 agents at airports beyond the current transit points have the equipment and training to deal with potential cases			0
and additional travel restrictions should not be ruled out			0
fourth , the infection of two health care workers in @entity19 during the treatment of @entity22 raises questions about the ability of hospitals across the country to handle the extensive safety protocols required to treat @entity7 patients			1
two medical facilities in the @entity23 have already successfully treated patients that have now been cured and two others have specialized facilities for treating patients with the virus			2
we should consider centralizing all future cases at these medical facilities , but hospitals across the @entity23 will still need to focus on screening and isolating suspected cases that may arrive at their facilities			2
finally , we need to increase our efforts to develop an @entity7 vaccine and to increase production of antiviral drugs			0
there are a few promising drugs to fight @entity7 in test phases			1
we should speed up testing of these drugs and explore the possibility of scaling up drug manufacturing at the same time as clinical testing			0
once we develop a drug with proven success , we should be ready to supply it in large numbers			0
in order to avoid bureaucratic red tape , we should begin discussion with the @entity51 , drug companies and @entity35 governments on the processes for purchasing and distributing of these drugs			0
the @entity7 epidemic is a reminder of the evolving nature of our national security challenges			0
a sick child in @entity35 has advanced into a global health security issue that is now knocking on @entity23 's door			1
we can successfully address this problem , protect our people and once again demonstrate @entity23 's compassion abroad			1
but much more needs to be done and it needs to happen quickly			0
like other national security challenges , the longer we wait to engage , the more limited our options will become and the likelihood of success will be reduced			0
join us on @entity210 / @entity209 .			0

@entity212 : @entity23 lack confidence in government 's ability to fight crises like @entity7
but @entity23 is country best equipped to tackle nightmare problems of @entity7 , he says
important that @entity23 help beat the disease in @entity35 to ease *threat* to @entity23 , @entity212 says
