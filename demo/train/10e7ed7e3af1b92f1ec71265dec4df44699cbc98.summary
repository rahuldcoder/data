@entity2 's @entity1 title defense lurched to a new low on saturday , as @entity4 was sent off in a 0 - 0 draw at bottom club @entity6			1
the result means @entity9 's third - placed team could fall 18 points behind @entity11 if the @entity13 leaders win at @entity14 on sunday , while city rivals @entity15 can move seven clear of @entity2 by beating @entity16			1
with top scorer @entity17 ending a run of 60 consecutive league appearances due to suspension , @entity2 looked woefully short of attacking ideas despite the return of striker @entity23			2
@entity4 came on for winger @entity24 just before an hour was played , but the 2007 world player of the year was booked twice within 18 minutes to leave his side a man short			2
the @entity30 's first yellow card came for jumping with an arm raised and the second was for stopping the home players taking a quick free - kick , resulting in his first red for @entity2 since signing from @entity36 for a reported $ 100 million in 2009			1
@entity9 also brought on striker @entity37 and @entity38 for @entity23 and @entity39 , but @entity2 's best chance was ruled out for offside			1
@entity2 have now won only six of the last 12 matches in all competitions , and @entity9 's future at the nine - time @entity47 titleholders may hinge on next month 's @entity48 last - 16 clash with @entity17 's former club @entity50			1
his team have already lost seven times this season -- two more defeats than the whole of the 2011 - 12 campaign -- and all of them have been away from home			2
" i liked the team 's attitude , i have no criticism			0
lots of players had great matches , like @entity67 and @entity68 , who have n't played for a while and they performed very well in a very demanding match , " said @entity9 , who was also without suspended defender @entity63			0
" i never talk about the missing players			0
we have had players injured for a month or two and i 've never talked about them			0
we also have players suspended and i have not used that as an excuse			0
" however , he hinted that his players were struggling to deal with the big points deficit they face in the title race			0
" the explanation begins on the first match day and since then things have happened that i do not want to talk about , " said @entity9			0
" after that , when the gap is big , one team plays without pressure and the other one feels like that they ca n't close the gap and there are motivational issues			0
" @entity91 retained his place in goal , having been handed a second chance alter an injury to his replacement @entity97 , but @entity9 would not guarantee that the @entity99 captain would stay in the team for tuesday 's @entity102 quarterfinal first leg against @entity103			2
" he hardly touched the ball against @entity6 , but it can be said that in these two matches the team has been good defensively and he has been part of the team 's defensive play			2
it is too early to say whether he will play against @entity103			0
" @entity103 moved up to seventh in the table after beating @entity112 2 - 0 , with both goals coming from @entity99 striker @entity114			1
@entity114 netted twice from corners to take his tally to 11 in @entity13 this season to put his team above @entity119 on goal difference , while @entity112 stayed 12th			0
earlier , @entity121 moved out of the bottom three with a 1 - 0 win at home to @entity124 , as @entity125 scored a first - half winner			1
@entity127 stayed just above the bottom three after a 3 - 1 defeat at mid-table @entity129 , whose @entity131 winger @entity130 celebrated his return from injury with two goals			0
in @entity137 , @entity136 moved up to third place with a 2 - 0 win at home to lowly @entity141			1
@entity143 forward @entity142 scored in the first half and then set up @entity146 @entity145 nine minutes after halftime to leave @entity136 six points behind leaders @entity150 , who host mid-table @entity151 on sunday			1
@entity154 moved five points clear of the relegation zone with a 4 - 0 win at home to @entity159 , as former @entity137 striker @entity160 scored twice .			1

@entity162 *midfielder* @entity4 sent off in @entity2 's 0 - 0 draw with bottom @entity1 club @entity6
former @entity36 star booked twice inside of 20 minutes after coming on in second half
@entity9 's @entity2 could end the *weekend* 18 points behind leaders @entity11
in @entity137 's @entity172 , @entity136 move up to third place with 2 - 0 *victory* at home to @entity141
