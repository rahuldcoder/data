-- should baby food makers be required to post lead warnings on their products in @entity4 ? that 's the question at stake in a civil trial that kicked off monday in @entity8 in @entity9			1
some of the country 's biggest baby food makers are defendants in the case , including @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
in a 2011 lawsuit , the @entity18 alleged that many of those companies ' foods and juices contain lead and that under @entity4 law , they are required to warn consumers			1
the suit targets products marketed and intended for babies and toddlers , including grape juice , packaged peaches and pears , carrots and sweet potatoes			1
it seeks to require the companies to put warning labels on their products , and face penalties of up to $ 2,500 per violation per day			1
" our hope is that rather than put the labels on , these companies will get off their duffs and do what all their competitors are doing and just get the lead out , " said @entity40 , president of the @entity18 , a @entity4 - based environmental group			1
" we banned lead in paint , we banned it in gasoline			0
what is it doing in baby food ? " according to the @entity57 , some 500,000 @entity56 children ages 1 to 5 have unsafe levels of lead in their blood			1
exposure to lead can affect virtually every system in the body and cause intellectual and behavioral deficits			0
representatives for @entity15 and @entity17 declined to discuss the case monday , both saying they do not comment on pending litigation			0
messages left with @entity16 and @entity14 were not immediately returned			0
attorneys for the defendants have previously argued they will show no warnings are required			0
" despite the trace amounts of lead in the products at issue , the federal government has determined that @entity56 need to eat more -- not less -- of these nutritious foods , " they said in court documents			2
the @entity81 , a trade group , released a statement stressing that @entity83 tests on products in the lawsuit found they do not pose any health concerns			1
" many minerals , including lead , are found naturally in soil and water throughout the world			0
as a result , virtually all foods grown in nature , including fruit -- whether fresh or packaged -- contain trace levels of such naturally occurring minerals , " it said			0
" recognizing this , the @entity83 regularly tests a wide variety of foods , including fruit juice and packaged fruit products , for lead and other minerals			2
the @entity83 has repeatedly concluded that these categories of products do not contain lead in amounts that would pose an unacceptable health risk to adults or children			2
" the trial , which is expected to last three to four weeks , has no jury			0
it 's being heard by judge @entity116			2
@entity0 's @entity117 contributed to this report .			0
