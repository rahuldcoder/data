the @entity1 @entity0 will allow the @entity3 's surveillance of domestic telephone communication records to continue for now			1
the justices without comment monday rejected an appeal from a privacy rights group , which claimed a secret federal court improperly authorized the government to collect the electronic records			1
the @entity12 filed its petition directly with the high court , bypassing the usual step of going to the lower federal courts first			1
such a move made it much harder for the justices to intervene at this stage , but @entity12 officials argued " exceptional ramifications " demanded immediate final judicial review			0
there was no immediate reaction to the court 's order from the public interest group , or from the @entity29			1
the @entity3 has publicly acknowledged it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of so - called metadata from telecom giant @entity33 and leading internet companies , including @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
the information includes the numbers , time , and length of nearly every phone call to and from the @entity1 in the past five years , but not the location or actual monitoring of the conversations themselves			2
to do so would require a separate , specifically targeted search warrant			0
the revelations on bulk data collection triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests , and about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance			2
the once - secret approval came in april from a judge at the @entity59 , which handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for " foreign intelligence purposes			0
" @entity33 turned over the metadata to the government			0
report : @entity3 , @entity67 among worst surveillance offenders , @entity66 says " telephone records , even without the content of the calls , can reveal an immense amount of sensitive , private information			1
there are no reasonable grounds for the @entity3 to have access to every call record of every @entity33 customer , " said @entity74 , president of @entity12			1
the @entity59 has applied the @entity80 " in a way that is contrary to both the text and purpose of the statute , " he said			0
this is the first direct challenge to the court order , and @entity12 said the @entity88 administration should have to publicly explain its legal justification for the spying program			0
the group also argued restrictions in federal law mean no other state or federal court can review the @entity59 's orders except the @entity0 itself			1
the group is suing on behalf of itself as a @entity33 customer , but also said the justices themselves have a stake in the legal fight			1
" because the @entity3 sweeps up judicial and congressional communications , it inappropriately arrogates exceptional power to the executive branch , " said the petition			1
the revelations of the @entity3 program and the inner workings of the @entity59 came after a former agency contractor , @entity66 , leaked documents to the @entity115 newspaper in @entity116			1
@entity66 fled to @entity117 and then @entity118 to escape @entity1 prosecution , and his supporters say they are working on asylum deals with other countries on his behalf			0
the @entity29 urged the high court to stay out of the current fight , called a " mandamus " review			1
@entity12 's petition " does not meet the stringent requirements for mandamus relief , and this court lacks jurisdiction " to act , solicitor general @entity129 said in the government 's brief , filed last month			1
" the mandamus petition does not establish that it is more than speculative that the @entity3 has reviewed , or might in the future review , records pertaining to petitioner 's members , particularly given the stringent , ( @entity59 ) - imposed restrictions that limit access to the database to counterterrorism purposes , " the @entity88 administration added			1
the @entity1 @entity0 does not comment on pending cases			1
the privacy rights group now has the option of going back to the lower courts and starting the legal process anew			1
prior lawsuits against the @entity3 program have been unsuccessful			2
opinion : has the @entity3 gone rogue ? days after @entity66 's disclosure of the @entity3 program , the @entity154 filed a lawsuit in @entity159 federal court			1
the @entity161 - based @entity160 did so in july			0
and @entity162 also filed a separate claim on behalf of @entity33 customers			0
the suits are still pending			0
telecoms themselves were the initial targets of legal action , after the @entity3 domestic surveillance program was unveiled in 2005			2
@entity169 later gave retroactive immunity to those private firms			0
the @entity59 secretly decides whether to grant certain types of government requests , including wiretapping , data analysis , and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the @entity1			0
legal sources say the tiny courtroom and adjacent areas are sealed tightly -- ironically given the political debate -- to prevent any eavesdropping by outsiders			0
eleven federal judges from around the country serve on the court for seven - year terms			2
they are appointed by the chief justice of the @entity1			0
@entity190 has named all current members , as a well as a three - judge panel to hear appeals of the @entity59 's orders , known as the @entity196			2
because it is an " ex-parte " body -- it hears only the government 's side -- the court has been criticized as a kangaroo court that too easily accedes to any government request			2
in order to collect information , the government has to demonstrate that it 's " relevant " to an international terrorism investigation			0
the 1978 @entity207 lays out exactly what the special court must decide : " a judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the @entity1 , interfere with a criminal , counterterrorism , or counterintelligence investigation , interfere with diplomatic relations , or endanger the life or physical safety of any person			0
" several federal judges who once served on the @entity59 refused to discuss their service when contacted by @entity228			0
the case is in @entity230 ( 13 - 58 )			0
@entity3 chief : reports @entity1 collected calls , e-mails from allies ' completely false '			2

a privacy group argues a secret federal court 's ok of @entity3 snooping was improper
@entity0 *sidesteps* the attempt to cut off @entity3 access to phone records
the @entity29 urged the high court to stay out of the current fight
the privacy group has the option of going back to lower courts
