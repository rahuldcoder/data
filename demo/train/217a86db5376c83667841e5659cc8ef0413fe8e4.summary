-- sen. @entity1 is appearing in a new wave of ads for @entity6 @entity5 candidates in @entity7 and @entity8 less than one week before @entity9			1
the @entity10 , which produces the ads and has featured @entity1 in a previous round of spots , says it 's using the @entity14 @entity6 as a voice to appeal to independent voters			1
and it 's not a bad arrangement for the likely @entity20 hopeful : the new ads appear in the first two presidential primary states			1
" if you 're a freedom - loving , liberty - loving voter , i urge you to get out and vote for @entity28 this tuesday , " he says in a spot -- first shared with @entity0 -- for @entity7 's @entity5 nominee			2
he repeats a similar message in a separate ad for @entity31 in @entity8 , but adds a special touch for the @entity8 's politically - mixed climate			0
" if you 're a freedom - loving , liberty - loving , leave - me - the - hell - alone voter , i urge you to get out and vote for @entity31 this tuesday , " @entity1 says			0
the ads appear to have been shot in the same setting as @entity10 ads that he cut for @entity5 @entity5 nominees in @entity41 and @entity42 , two closes races with for potential of a libertarian spoiler			1
a @entity10 source said the ads " fit into our theme this year of using credible messengers in target races , particularly to help break through the clutter and carry the free enterprise message			2
" @entity1 has repeatedly said he 'll announce his 2016 decision in the spring			0
if he decides to run as expected , it could be a big boost for him to get this kind of exposure in @entity7 and @entity8 -- and the blessing of a major mainstream and respected @entity6 group like the @entity10			1
talking about the first round of ads , he told @entity0 in @entity8 earlier this month that he thinks his appeal goes " beyond the @entity6 " and he can be helpful in bringing in independents			0
" at the very end , it 's that five or 10 percent that are undecided , might vote for a third party , or might vote independent that we really need , " he said			0
" i 'm trying hard to let people know that @entity6 will do things differently if we elect a @entity6 majority			0
