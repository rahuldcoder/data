@entity0 , @entity1 -- officials say two men in @entity1 have been stoned to death for adultery and murder , while another escaped death by digging his way out of the hole where he was buried to face a similar fate , according to media reports			1
the sentences follow sharp criticism by human rights groups of @entity1 's use of such punishments			1
judiciary spokesman @entity21 on tuesday told reporters about the stonings , which took place in the northeastern city of @entity26 about 20 days ago , the reports said			0
according to the @entity26 prosecutor , the men committed various crimes , including adultery and murder , @entity21 said			1
in the practice , the men are buried up to their chests and people pelt them with stones until they die			2
a third was supposed to have been stoned to death			2
however , he freed himself by climbing out of the stone hole			2
" stoning is a horrific practice , designed to increase the suffering of those facing execution , and it has no place in the modern world , " @entity41 said last year			0
@entity21 said @entity1 's judiciary chief , ayatollah @entity49 , had made recommendations that would ban the practice and said that a measure has been introduced in @entity52 to stop the punishment			1
but " until this measure is approved and becomes law , the judges have the independence not to pay heed to the recommendations of the @entity61 chief , " @entity21 said			0
@entity41 said in a report last year that @entity1 's penal code allows execution by stoning as the penalty for adultery			1
the group said the law calls for stones " large enough to cause pain , but not so large as to kill the victim immediately			0
" in august , @entity41 issued a statement welcoming an announcement that stoning had been suspended and several women had their sentences commuted			0
in that announcement , the group said at least one stoning execution was carried out in 2007 in @entity80 and a woman and a man were known to have been stoned to death in @entity26 in may 2006			1
" the majority of those sentenced to death by stoning are women			2
women are not treated equally with men under the law and by courts , and they are also particularly vulnerable to unfair trials because their higher illiteracy rate makes them more likely to sign confessions to crimes they did not commit , " @entity41 said			0
