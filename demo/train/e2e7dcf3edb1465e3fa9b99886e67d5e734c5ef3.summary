on friday @entity0 held a national day of mourning			0
for this is not simply an accident			0
accidents and emergencies can not last two decades			0
as a field researcher who has dedicated years of work to maritime migration , and as an @entity0 citizen , i am grateful to the @entity0 @entity11 for taking such an unprecedented decision to make this declaration			0
today we honor the memory and the families of more than 100 refugees , young adults , women , and children from @entity20 , retrieved off the southern @entity0 island of @entity22 ; and of the many dozens who are still trapped at the bottom of the sea			2
we also honor the selfless work of the island 's residents , tourists , armed forces , medical personnel , and fishermen who have now rescued thousands on their way to @entity35			1
but i have listened uncomfortably to national and @entity37 politicians who , as usual , have pointed their finger at smugglers , purporting that redoubling efforts to fight them will prevent further loss of life at sea			1
people at the helm of unseaworthy vessels are menial laborers executing the last and risky part of trips organized by transnational criminal networks			1
smugglers are not the reason why people are on those vessels			1
@entity0 and @entity37 institutions are asking what can be done to prevent further tragedies			1
to answer , they have to ask also whether they did anything to enable them in the first place , including failing to consider implications and alternatives of their specific actions and inactions			0
i need to raise a seemingly simple question			0
what brings thousands of people to trust criminals , pay them 10 times more than they would pay a comfortable seat on a ferry or airplane , and risk their lives ? the overarching answer , in its brutal obviousness , is that they may not legally get on those planes and ferries			2
they come from countries , such as @entity20 , that methodically oppress their own citizens and will not grant passports and exit visas			0
they are refugees , forced to leave home without the time and resources to secure legal passage			1
they have survived the @entity89 , and returning from @entity90 or @entity91 is not a feasible and rational option			0
they fail to offer the financial guarantees requested by @entity35 consulates , and will not be granted a visa			1
quotas and legal channels for employment are inadequate both to their needs and to the needs of @entity35 economies and aging populations			1
they are prepared to die as they leave with hope , but do not wish to survive in despair			0
they fall through the immense cracks of a system that needs them for a job or might grant them asylum , but only if they first make it through miles of peril and years of exploitation			0
it is evident then , that the @entity122 chronicle of death can not end merely as a result of tougher penalties on smugglers , additional resources for search - and - rescue operations , and heightened military surveillance and dissuasion			1
prisons , radars , and helicopters are not solutions			0
every institution , at every level of governance , needs radical action			0
fishermen and shipmasters should not have to fear that rescuing people will result in criminal charges for aiding and abetting undocumented immigrants			2
or are they to engage in racial profiling and evaluate in hectic moments whether somebody in distress is a refugee or an undocumented economic immigrant ? should they rescue the former , but abandon the latter and perhaps face prosecution for failure to rescue ? can these decisions , and people 's life , be left to discretion , chance , and the elements ? @entity37 intergovernmental border patrols ( @entity160 ) and national armed forces need to clarify , to themselves and to citizens , whether they patrol the @entity122 to deter migration , to rescue people , or to intercept and deport them to countries of origin and transit			1
' safe , legal channel needed ' citizens need to remember that in liberal democracies it is on their behalf and in their name that laws are written and implemented			1
they need to demonstrate to lawmakers that they are not " afraid " of their @entity20 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity91 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 employees , fianc√©s , neighbors , schoolmates , and coworkers , to mention the nationalities increasingly resorting to maritime journeys			0
what happens with boundaries of socio - economic inclusion and integration is related to what happens at the border			0
@entity197 and @entity37 policymakers need to envision a common family reunification and asylum policy , and establish more homogenous parameters for asylum adjudication			1
this could help curb the equally perilous journeys of hope of many @entity205 across the @entity206 , from @entity207 to @entity0 and then to northern @entity35			1
most urgently , national and @entity37 policymakers need to establish accessible , safe , and legal channels for internally and internationally displaced people to apply for asylum or to be granted temporary protection			1
these are not problems only concerning smugglers , immigrants , and refugees			2
this national day of mourning is a call for the @entity37 and its member states to start refashioning what sovereignty and humanitarianism mean in the 21st century			2
it is an invitation to fellow @entity0 and @entity35 citizens , including migrants and their children , to practise democracy in its representative and participatory dimensions			2
and it serves as yet another reminder of north - south disparities in wealth and power , signaled by the fact that the @entity122 is a frontier in the first place			2
there is no single solution to the @entity122 chronicle of death			1
there are certainly alternatives to this state of affairs			0
they are more rational , and more just , than inaction and methodic negligence .			0

smugglers are not why people are on these vessels , writes @entity250
quotas inadequate both to refugees and @entity35 economies , he says
@entity250 : @entity37 nations must establish safe , legal channels for displaced people
no single solution to the @entity122 chronicle of death , he says
