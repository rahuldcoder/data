-- remember the worst job you ever had ? you know , back when there were jobs to be had ? @entity6 tries to strike up a relationship with @entity8 in " @entity9			1
" for writer - director @entity11 , it was the summer he spent on hiatus between college and the real world , working as a carny at the local carnival			1
he 's turned the experience into the basis for the wonderful " @entity9			1
" handing out stuffed animals to the lucky customer whose tin horse romps home in first place -- this is not how @entity25 ( @entity6 from " @entity26 " ) would choose to see himself			0
the paycheck is dismal , but undeniably commensurate with ( as a character puts it ) " the work of pathetic , lazy morons , " which is what it comes down to			0
most jobs have their compensations , though			0
at @entity9 , for @entity25 , the biggest benefit comes in the form of @entity38 ( @entity8 ) , another recent grad with plans to move to @entity41 in the fall , and who is n't entirely disdainful of his company			1
last time out of the gate @entity11 enjoyed a hit with the spectacularly lewd " @entity48 , " an angle that @entity50 is understandably keen to play up in the marketing this time around			1
at first glance the cap seems to fit			0
@entity25 ' sexual experience -- or rather the lack of it -- is a defining element in the story			0
" @entity9 " comes with the usual farcical peccadilloes of teen comedy -- barf gags , car wrecks and inopportune erections -- as well as several familiar supporting players from the @entity65 stable			1
@entity66 and @entity67 are engagingly upbeat as the mutually besotted park managers , and @entity70 ( from " @entity69 " ) is @entity25 ' cerebral , pipe - smoking buddy , @entity73			0
( @entity11 directed a couple of episodes of @entity65 's short - lived @entity77 series " undeclared			1
" ) there 's also an extended cameo from @entity80 , an actor whose faintly supercilious good looks have graced innumerable dumb slacker comedies , including " @entity83 , " " @entity84 " and " waiting			0
" yet , after an initial flurry of gross guffaws , the movie edges toward something rather different : a nuanced , sensitive coming - of - age story that finds its heart in post-adolescent romantic turmoil			2
obviously adept with actors , @entity11 respects his characters too much to let first impressions stick			1
the relationships in " @entity9 " are much richer , and stickier , for it			1
the understanding that @entity25 arrives at with his father ( @entity99 ) , for example , is delineated in just a handful of looks and glances between them , but it 's enough to imply the older man 's resignation at his fate , and his appreciation for @entity25 ' tacit sympathy			2
it 's in moments like these ( and there are a number of them ) that we 're reminded @entity11 made a fine indie movie , " @entity117 , " more than a decade ago now , another sharp and tender comic distillation of family bonds and fractures			1
blessed with comical seriousness , @entity6 is like a young @entity122 : fretful , intelligent , naive and deluded			2
and like @entity122 , he seems to enjoy more than his fair share of luck with the opposite sex			0
still , " @entity9 " makes more effort than " @entity48 " -- not that hard admittedly -- to develop a character for @entity128			1
looking wan and pensive ( the " @entity130 " star always looks in need of a good night 's sleep ) , @entity128 as @entity38 gives the impression she 's living life more acutely than the others			0
she seems to have more on the line			0
set in the mid- ' 80s , the film suggests the period unobtrusively , but predominantly through pop music			2
@entity139 provides sweet relief to repeated bursts of @entity143 's " @entity142			0
" yes , in retrospect , that 's exactly what being young in 1987 was like			2
a mature movie about immature young people , " @entity9 " may be too muted to succeed in today 's marketplace , too sensitive for its own good			1
like an anxious parent , a critic can only send it on its way and hope the world treats it well			0
" @entity9 " is rated r and runs 107 minutes			2
for @entity157 's take , click here .			0

" @entity9 " is about a young man *spending* a summer in a *crummy* carnival
@entity163 : film pays attention to teen movie *clich√©s* but goes much deeper
