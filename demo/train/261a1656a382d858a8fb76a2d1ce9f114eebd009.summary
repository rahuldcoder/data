-- it 's official : @entity2 of @entity3 has given birth to the future monarch of the @entity6			2
of course , as i write this , mere moments after the blessed event , very little is known about the newest member of the @entity12			2
will the little prince have its mother 's good looks or its father 's good looks pre-baldness ? where does it stand on the phone - hacking controversy ? will he marry @entity22 or @entity23 ? one thing 's for sure : the royal baby is going to have a wild life ahead of him			1
he 'll probably live for at least a century , if the genes are any indication			2
he will need to learn some valuable lessons			2
and what better place to begin the @entity32 's education than @entity33 , a tv show about crisscrossing royal bloodlines and fancy accents ? like the @entity38 books that inspired it , thrones is set in @entity40 , which is basically @entity41 in the @entity42 with more dragons and fewer magical swords			1
here are ten lessons that 'll guarantee that @entity46 does n't lose his head , metaphorically speaking			1
stay on good terms with your family members			2
all of your family members			0
siblings , parents , uncles , even embarrassing cousins			0
seriously , you have to spend the rest of your life with these people , and if you are n't careful , one of them might send their illegitimate magical shadow - baby to stab you in the back			1
when traveling , it 's always better if you can speak the local language			0
@entity66 â € ” aka @entity66 , aka @entity67 , aka @entity68 â € ” spends most of her days traveling from foreign city to foreign city			0
local lords always think they can fool her			0
but she speaks the local language and studies the history of every spot she visits ; very often , she becomes more popular with the local citizens than their own government			0
( sometimes , she becomes the local government			0
pay attention to your subjects in the outer provinces			0
because everyone on @entity33 is too busy with the palace intrigue in @entity33 , nobody ever pays any attention to the poor @entity90 , even though they keep sending increasingly - urgent messages about an army of attacking ice - zombies			0
what i 'm saying is , do n't forget about @entity97 , okay ? 4			1
although they make excellent bodyguards			0
do n't trust your friends			1
do n't trust your enemies			1
they do n't play fair			1
actually , do n't trust anyone			1
since you live in @entity41 , it 's pretty much always winter			1
put on a coat ! 9			0
the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword			0
since you have no actual political power , the moral of this lesson is basically that you should carry a sword on you at all times			1
you 're royalty , gosh darn it ! if you ca n't carry a sword , who can ? you think prime minister @entity123 can wield a sword ? yeesh , speaking of eunuchs , amiright ? # @entity126 10			2
do not have sex with anyone in your immediate family			0
because something like this could happen			0
