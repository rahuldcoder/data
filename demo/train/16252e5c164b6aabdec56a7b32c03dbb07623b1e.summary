-- on february 14 , when @entity1 aired season 2 of " @entity3 , " my book , " @entity6 , " appeared clearly on the desk of vice president @entity8 in episode 2			1
it was as incongruous as it was unexpected			0
i ca n't think of anyone less likely to read , let alone be inspired by , my narrative history about the statesmen of the great @entity6 than the scheming , diabolical , @entity8			1
with the possible exception , that is , of sen. @entity19			1
@entity20 , the @entity21 , seeking his sixth term in the @entity6 , handily defeated @entity23 , his tea party opponent , in the @entity26 primary on may 20			1
he has certainly helped the @entity26 chances of capturing the @entity6 by spearheading the effort to defeat other potential tea party nominees			1
but as @entity20 turns to his general election campaign against @entity32 , it is a good moment to inventory the extraordinary damage that @entity20 has done to the @entity6 over the past 5Â½ years			1
@entity19 did not create the hyper - partisan @entity6 , which has been in a long downward spiral dating back at least to the mid- 1990s			1
but through a deliberate and calculated political strategy , @entity20 drove the @entity6 to a new low			1
when @entity38 took office in january 2009 , @entity37 was close to plunging into a second @entity40			0
in one month , we lost three quarters of a million jobs			0
our national narrative is that @entity37 come together in times of crisis , but it did n't happen this time			0
@entity38 faced total partisan opposition despite the potential economic catastrophe			0
on the economic stimulus , health care , financial regulation , and then virtually everything else , sen. @entity20 did everything in his power to keep the @entity26 in lockstep opposition			1
by any objective measure -- the amount of legislation passed , filibusters conducted , holds applied , executive and judicial nominations blocked -- the @entity6 has become a more dyspeptic and dysfunctional institution			2
again and again , the @entity6 has failed to fulfill its role as what @entity64 once described as " the nation 's mediator			2
" thoughtful debate , principled compromise , and pursuit of the national interest have all been subordinated to the permanent campaign for partisan advantage			0
it has been a particularly cynical strategy because @entity20 knows what the @entity6 should be			1
unlike his predecessors , @entity76 , who hated the @entity6 when he arrived and resolved to make it more like the partisan , hard - edged @entity3 , and @entity77 , who never really understood it , @entity20 grew up in the great @entity6 of the 1960s and 1970s			1
in recent speeches and articles , he has invoked the name of @entity83 , the longest - serving @entity6 majority leader , capturing the essence of @entity86 's leadership quite precisely by noting that @entity86 had built a @entity6 based on " mutual trust and respect			1
" @entity83 lived by the @entity89 and treated everyone -- democrats and @entity26 , veteran senators and new arrivals -- the way he expected to be treated			2
although he was a strong @entity97 , bipartisanship radiated from @entity86 , who ate breakfast every morning with his best friend , @entity100 sen. @entity100			2
he understood that @entity37 has one president at a time , and @entity6 leaders have a special responsibility to work with the president , regardless of party			2
@entity86 was one of president @entity108 's closest friends , but he had at least 27 private meetings with president @entity110 , and kept his confidences despite their sharp differences on many issues			0
he was admired for his great knowledge of the world , particularly @entity116			0
he understood that the @entity6 was the place where senators had to subordinate their individual agendas , to take collective action through principled compromise			1
in @entity86 's @entity6 , pursuit of the national interest and commitment to the institution of the @entity6 were paramount			2
no @entity6 leader could differ more from @entity83 than @entity19			1
he has shown constant and visible contempt for the president			0
he has denounced those who disagree with him on campaign finance disclosure as " liberal thugs			0
" he has opposed , or reneged on , every deal struck to make the @entity6 process nominations more swiftly			2
he famously said that his highest priority was denying re-election to @entity38 , when in fact his highest priority should have been making the @entity6 work in the interests of the country			2
he personifies the unwillingness of many republicans to accept the results of presidential elections that they lose , and repeatedly , he has been willing to deadlock the @entity6 for partisan purposes			2
the @entity26 response to criticisms of @entity20 has been to attack majority leader @entity149			1
but there are light years of differences between @entity149			0
@entity149 is attempting to run the @entity6 and enact the legislative program of the president , while @entity20 is practicing a strategy of total and utter obstruction			1
the contrast calls to mind the famous comment of speaker @entity160 : " any jackass can kick down a barn , but it takes a carpenter to build one			0
" to be sure , the partisan divide in the @entity6 is far larger than it was in the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s			2
but that reality makes it crucial to have leaders who can bridge those differences to move the country forward			0
sen. @entity20 has chosen to exacerbate partisan differences rather than overcome them			2
starting in 2013 , it was quite clear that many senators -- @entity175 and @entity26 -- shared the anger of the public about the dysfunctional @entity6			1
they were committed to helping the @entity6 return to " regular order " : legislating through committees , consideration of amendments , vigorous debate and principled compromise			0
the @entity6 showed signs of breaking through the gridlock on a series of issues , including immigration , the budget , the farm bill , and consideration of executive nominations			0
@entity194 occurred as @entity6 republicans -- veterans and new arrivals -- came forward to work in a constructive , bipartisan fashion			0
they have always had to work around @entity20			0
leaders set the tone , and virtually every serious observer thinks that the @entity6 would be a far different place if the @entity26 were led by someone else , such as @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 or @entity208			1
in 2012 , @entity20 was measuring the drapes in the majority leader 's office , when the nation re-elected president @entity38 and rejected the @entity26 strategy of obstruction and extremism			1
now he is betting on the president 's diminished poll numbers and the impact of a lower @entity175 turnout , presenting himself as a leader who can make the @entity6 function again			1
it turns out that @entity20 does share one thing with the president that he disdains : the audacity of hope			0
he has the audacity to claim to be a restorer of the @entity6 , and the hope that people will forget the record of the past 5Â½ years			0
the voters of @entity232 will decide whether he gets another term , but the verdict on the damage he has caused in the @entity6 is already in			0
join us on @entity238 / @entity237 .			0

@entity240 says @entity6 is much more *divisive* place because of @entity19
he argues that the *traditions* of the @entity6 have been about " mutual trust and respect "
the @entity26 minority leader has , says @entity240 , taken the @entity6 to a new low
@entity20 won @entity26 primary for his @entity6 seat , will face @entity97 @entity32
