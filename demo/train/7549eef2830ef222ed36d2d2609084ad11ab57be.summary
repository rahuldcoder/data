@entity1 officials held a " positive " meeting monday with a @entity3 delegation in an effort to restart talks with the reclusive nation over ending @entity11 's nuclear program , the @entity1 special representative for @entity3 policy said			1
the decision by the @entity1 to launch the two days of discussions in @entity16 , @entity17 , stems in part from recent meetings between @entity3 and @entity20 , a senior @entity13 official told reporters traveling with secretary of state @entity22 in @entity23 last week			1
" we are moving in a positive direction , " @entity1 ambassador @entity24 said from the @entity25 in @entity16 after the meeting concluded			1
" we have narrowed some differences but we still have differences that we have to resolve			0
" the day started with both nations presenting their positions on the resumption of talks			0
@entity34 , @entity1 special envoy to the six - party talks on @entity3 , called the presentations " useful			1
" the groups also dined together for dinner before adjourning for the night , said @entity24 , who is leading the @entity1 delegation			1
the @entity3 delegation is led by first vice foreign minister @entity41 , @entity34 said			0
" as you know our goal is to find a solid foundation on which to launch a resumption of discussions both bilateral and multilateral and we will continue to work hard to bring that about , " @entity24 said			2
at a previous meeting between the two countries in july , @entity50 laid out a list of things it was looking for from @entity11 to demonstrate its seriousness about abandoning its nuclear ambitions , the @entity13 official told reporters last week			0
one of the things the @entity1 was seeking is @entity3 engagement with @entity20 , the official said , adding that a recent " constructive meeting " between the two countries helped get the parties to this point			2
the official said there is concern that if the @entity1 or @entity20 do not engage with @entity3 , it could lead to miscalculation or provocations on the part of @entity3			1
the official said the meeting in @entity16 would give the @entity1 an opportunity to see how the @entity3 absorbed what the @entity1 laid out in july , and what @entity3 's intentions are			2
deputy @entity13 spokesman @entity77 called the meetings " exploratory " in nature			0
" we are not seeking to have talks for talks ' sake , " @entity77 said			0
it 's " safe to say we are looking for concrete actions " by @entity3 before resuming the six - party talks , which have been dormant since 2008 , @entity77 said			1
the six - party talks are a vehicle launched under former president @entity89 to negotiate an end to @entity11 's nuclear program			1
they involve both @entity93 , the @entity1 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			2
at various points , progress seemed to be made , only to have @entity3 either pull out over disagreements on verifiable declarations of their nuclear program or engage in what some @entity1 officials described as belligerent behavior that scuttled the talks			1
the @entity1 has been in contact on a regular basis with all sides involved in the six - party talks , @entity77 said			1
@entity50 has called repeatedly for @entity11 to undertake a series of prerequisite steps , such as halting missile and nuclear tests , and further development of nuclear weapons , to show it is interested in coming back to talks			0
at a news conference this month with @entity20 president @entity121 , @entity1 president @entity119 said , " if @entity11 continues to ignore its international obligations , it will invite even more pressure and isolation			2
if the @entity3 abandons its quest for nuclear weapons and moves towards denuclearization , it will enjoy greater security and opportunity for its people			0
" after taking office in 2009 , @entity119 was met with a set of provocations			0
@entity3 test - fired missiles and conducted a new round of nuclear tests			0
a small opening toward the resumption of talks was reversed after @entity3 was accused of sinking a @entity20 naval vessel in the @entity143 , followed by their artillery shelling of a @entity20 island in november 2010 in which two civilians were killed			0
@entity24 will step down from his position after the meetings and will be succeeded by @entity151 , the @entity1 ambassador to the @entity152 , the @entity154 ' nuclear watchdog , diplomatic sources said			1
the @entity13 did not give a specific reason for @entity24 's decision to step down , but @entity77 said he believes it is a " personal " decision			2
in addition to his role at the @entity13 , @entity24 has also maintained his position on the faculty at the @entity162 at @entity163 outside @entity164			0
@entity34 , a foreign policy adviser to the @entity165 and an expert on @entity94 and @entity167 , will become the new chief @entity1 negotiator to the six - party talks and will report to @entity151 in his new role .			1
