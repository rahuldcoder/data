@entity0 , @entity1 -- a black @entity3 , bullet casings and a pizza box appear to connect a parolee with ties to a white supremacist prison gang to the shooting death of @entity1 's prisons chief , according to a search warrant affidavit obtained friday by @entity2			1
the affidavit , filed by the @entity14 's @entity13 , details what authorities believe links @entity17 , who died in a shootout with sheriff 's deputies in @entity22 , and the @entity1 killing of state prisons chief @entity24			1
of key focus in the affidavit is a 1991 black @entity3 that authorities say @entity17 was driving in a wild , high - speed chase thursday that saw the 28 - year - old open fire on sheriff 's deputies before slamming into an 18 - wheeler , climbing out of the wreckage and opening fire again			1
hours later , @entity17 died from a gunshot wound to head suffered during the shootout , leaving behind more questions than answers in a case that has spanned two states			1
on friday , the wreckage of the @entity3 was under intense scrutiny after witnesses reported a similar vehicle -- a black , boxy car with @entity1 license plates -- near the @entity46 , @entity1 , house of @entity24 on tuesday , the day he was killed			1
among the links in the cases , according to the affidavit , are shell casings from a 9mm handgun found at @entity24 house			0
they are the same brand and caliber used in the shooting of a @entity59 , @entity22 , sheriff 's deputy , it said			1
video : pizza deliveryman remembered in the @entity3 's trunk was a @entity65 box carrier and a @entity67 uniform jacket , it said			2
that pizza carrier and jacket are a key reason why @entity72 authorities are also in @entity22 to examine the @entity3			1
they are investigating the killing of 27 - year - old @entity75 , a @entity76 in @entity72			2
@entity75 disappeared from work on sunday and was found dead in the @entity72 suburb of @entity79			0
@entity75 's family said he delivered pizzas as a way to earn extra money for his wife and his three girls			2
@entity72 investigators tell @entity2 there is a " strong connection " between the killings of @entity75 and @entity24			0
even as the investigation appears to link @entity17 to the shooting , authorities have said little about a possible motive			1
did @entity17 kill a pizza deliveryman to get a hold of his uniform as part of an effort to disguise himself ? did he target @entity100 because of the prison chief 's crackdown on white supremacist gangs in prison ? was he part of a wider conspiracy to kill @entity24 ? or was it something else ? high - speed chase in @entity22 this much is known : on thursday , @entity17 sped through @entity111 , @entity22 , near the @entity113 state line , about 700 miles from @entity46			1
deputy @entity114 tried to pull the car over			0
it 's unclear exactly why , other than it would have a been a routine part of @entity114 's job			2
@entity114 did not know about the @entity24 case , authorities said			2
@entity17 shot the deputy three times , hitting him twice in the chest and grazing his head			1

authorities say they have looked at the dashcam video of the shooting			0
@entity114 remains hospitalized at a @entity135 - @entity134 area hospital			0
the information the deputy gave allowed law enforcement to catch up with @entity17			1
a high - speed chase ensued , ending about 30 miles away in @entity141 , @entity22 , with @entity17 firing out of his window at police , law enforcement said			1
" i would say he was running about 100 mph , and he had his left arm out the window and he was just shooting , " said @entity141 police chief @entity144 , whose patrol car was parked in the median as the @entity3 raced past			0
the chase ended when the @entity3 screeched onto another road and slammed into an 18 - wheel truck , authorities said			0
with the front of his car crushed , @entity17 got out and started shooting again			1
@entity17 did n't hit any officers this time , they said			2
he was taken to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead thursday night , authorities said			2
