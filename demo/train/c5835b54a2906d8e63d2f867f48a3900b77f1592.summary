@entity0 -- president @entity2 and @entity4 prime minister @entity3 met for more than three hours tuesday evening amid a dispute over @entity4 's decision to build new @entity8 housing on disputed land in @entity10			1
the @entity2 administration has pushed to restart peace talks between @entity4 and the @entity13 and has called on @entity4 to stop building settlements on territory it captured in the 1967 @entity18 war			1
@entity3 's meeting at the @entity20 came the day after he defended his government 's plans to build new housing units in @entity10 , a move that has strained ties with @entity4 's largest ally			1
@entity3 got to the @entity20 at 5:30 p.m. , and he conferred with @entity2 for nearly 90 minutes in the @entity27 , from 5:34 to 7:03 p.m. a @entity20 official said the president then went to his residence and @entity3 remained at the @entity20 to consult with his staff in the @entity32			1
@entity3 requested another meeting with @entity2 , who returned to the @entity27 to meet with @entity3 from 8:20 p.m. to 8:55 p.m. , said the official , who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss details of the meeting			2
@entity3 left the @entity20 at 9:05 p.m. without speaking to reporters at a stakeout			2
the @entity4 leader arrived after a show of solidarity with leaders of @entity43 from both parties , during which he thanked the @entity47 lawmakers for their " constant support " and " unflagging " friendship			1
" even though the challenges are immense , our will and our partnership is also immense , " @entity3 said at an appearance with house speaker @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity20 minority leader @entity54 , @entity55			2
" we have no stronger ally anywhere in the world than @entity4 and we all know that we 're in a difficult moment , but i 'm glad the prime minister is here ... so we can have an open and straightforward dialogue about how we can provide more security for our friends in @entity4 and do everything we can to make sure that the @entity69 have no ability to develop a nuclear weapon , " @entity54 said			0
@entity52 told reporters that @entity43 speaks with " one voice " on the subject of @entity4			2
" together we remain committed to advancing the peace process , preserving @entity4 's security , responsible sanctions against @entity69 , " she said			0
@entity3 's visit to @entity0 comes as @entity4 and the @entity47 find themselves at odds over @entity4 's plan to build new housing on disputed land in @entity10 -- a plan he defended sharply monday night			1
@entity4 's announcement two weeks ago that it plans to build 1,600 apartments in an area claimed by both @entity4 and @entity13 came amid an @entity2 administration push for new @entity4 - @entity13 talks , but @entity3 told the @entity91 that " the connection between the @entity8 people and @entity10 can not be denied			1
" " the @entity8 people were building @entity10 3,000 years ago , and the @entity8 people are building @entity10 today , " he told @entity91 , the leading @entity94 lobby in the @entity47 , to prolonged applause			1
" @entity10 is not a settlement			0
" @entity13 leaders have refused to rejoin peace talks until @entity4 freezes the construction of @entity8 settlements in the @entity105 and @entity10			1
but @entity3 said " everyone knows " the neighborhoods where the new housing units will be built " will be part of @entity4 in any peace settlement , " and the new construction " in no way precludes the possibility of a two - state solution			1
" the @entity115 carefully avoided criticism of @entity3 on tuesday			0
@entity115 spokesman @entity117 told reporters the @entity47 would continue conversations with @entity4 and efforts to create " an atmosphere of trust " between @entity4 and the @entity13			0
" do we see eye to eye on everything ? no , " @entity117 told reporters at the @entity115			0
" are we satisfied with the exchange and the seriousness the prime minister has taken our concerns on board ? we are			0
and this is a conversation that has involved the secretary and obviously today will involve the president as well			0
" @entity3 met monday with vice president @entity135 and with secretary of state @entity136 , who has called the @entity4 announcement insulting			1
in her own speech to @entity91 , she said the @entity47 commitment to @entity4 's security was " rock - solid " -- but added that as " @entity4 's friend , it is our responsibility to give credit when it is due and to tell the truth when it is needed			2
" " we objected to this announcement because we are committed to @entity4 and its security , which we believe depends on a comprehensive peace -- because we are determined to keep moving forward along a path that ensures @entity4 's future as a secure and democratic jewish state living in peace with its @entity13 and @entity156 neighbors , " @entity147 said			0
the @entity47 is @entity4 's leading ally and provides nearly $ 3 billion a year in aid to the jewish state , about three - quarters of which goes to purchase @entity47 military equipment			2
@entity91 has called on the @entity2 administration to step back from its " public demands and unilateral deadlines directed at @entity4 , " but @entity147 defended the administration 's call for @entity4 to stop building in largely @entity156 @entity10			1
@entity165 , @entity4 's deputy prime minister , told @entity1 's " @entity170 " that construction on the project announced earlier this month would not begin for at least two years , " according to the normal process of planning			0
" " so this is really not a problem now , " @entity165 said			0
@entity1 's @entity172 and @entity173 contributed to this report .			0
