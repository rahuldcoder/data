-- what a difference a day makes			2
on july 2 , @entity2 was counting the days she had left to live			1
the @entity4 woman is suffering from an autoimmune disease that , without expensive treatment , will cause her heart to fail			1
on july 3 , thanks to a mysterious stranger who showed up at her door , she had in her hands more than enough money to get the treatment that can save her life			1
two weeks later , she still struggles to explain the dramatic change in her fortune			0
" this is a miracle " she told @entity0 partner @entity18 , referring to the mystery donor as an " angel that walks among us			1
" hope with a cost for 12 long years , the single mother of four has battled systemic scleroderma			0
the disease causes her body to overproduce collagen , making her skin , vital organs and blood vessels hard			0
eventually the disease would have caused her heart to fail			2
and @entity2 says she felt time was running out			1
she told the @entity37 tv stations , @entity18 and @entity38 , that she 'd found a doctor in @entity40 who could do a stem cell treatment			2
one with an 80 % success rate			0
however , the treatment came with a hefty $ 125,000 ( us $ 116,000 ) price tag -- far out of reach for @entity2			1
turning to the internet in the age of the @entity46 , @entity2 and her family did what many others in similar situations do : they started a fundraising page online			1
and on july 3 , a man called the house saying he too wanted to donate			2
looking back , @entity2 remembers there were unusual things about the phone call			1
he had a monotone voice , a deliberately altered one			0
maybe it was so she would n't recognize him , @entity2 told @entity18			1
the stranger also said he 'd bring a bank draft , which made @entity2 think his donation could be substantial			1
so , she wrote a thank you note and got ready to greet the man			2
the stranger at the door the man turned up wearing reflective sunglasses , a hat and a coat buttoned all the way up			2
he handed her an envelope without the hint of a smile			0
he was " completely stone - faced " she told @entity18			0
" i handed him the thank you card			0
" then as he turned to go , she said , " i said ' @entity82 bless you			0
' then he smiled a big smile			0
@entity2 went inside not knowing what the envelope contained			1
" when i opened it , i thought i was seeing the numbers wrong , the decimals wrong , the zeroes wrong			0
" the draft was for $ 128,000 ( us $ 119,000 ) a windfall @entity2 could n't believe it			1
she collapsed , she cried			0
she even hyperventilated , she told @entity18			0
" i said ' thank you @entity82 ! @entity94 , i 'm going to be saved ! ' " then when she regained her wits and walked outside to seeif she could find her benefactor he was gone			0
there was no trace of the tall , slender man with the big check			2
but if they could find him , @entity2 told @entity38 , " i would give him a big hug " and tell him , " you have absolutely saved my family			1
" @entity107 , @entity2 's daughter , summed it up best			1
she told @entity38 : " this is my mom 's life on a piece of paper			0
" woman gets donor kidney after husband 's efforts to find one went viral			2

@entity2 : mystery donor is an " angel that walks among us "
the woman needs treatment to cause her heart from failing
but the price tag is out of her reach
the man hands her the money and walks away
