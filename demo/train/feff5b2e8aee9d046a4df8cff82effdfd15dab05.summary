@entity0 -- there is no health risk from consuming milk with extremely low levels of radiation , like those found in @entity0 and @entity9 , experts said thursday , echoing the @entity11 @entity10			1
" when we have a disaster like we 've had with a nuclear power plant in @entity19 , we 're probably going to find things that are truly not a public health risk , but i think it 's very difficult for the public to assimilate this information and understand the risks , " said dr. @entity12 , a radiation oncologist and head of @entity16 's @entity15			2
the federal agency said wednesday it was increasing its nationwide monitoring of radiation in milk , precipitation , drinking water , and other outlets			1
it already tracks radiation in those potential exposure routes through an existing network of stations across the country			2
results from screening samples of milk taken in the past week in @entity42 , @entity0 , and in @entity43 , @entity9 , detected radioactive iodine , or iodine - 131 , at a level 5,000 times lower than the limit set by the @entity48 , officials said			1
at that level , a person would have to drink 1,000 liters of milk to receive the same amount of radiation as a chest x-ray , said dr. @entity55 , radiation oncologist at @entity58 's @entity57			1
the @entity60 isotope has a very short half - life of about eight days , the @entity10 said , so the level detected in milk and milk products is expected to drop relatively quickly			1
" the good news about iodine is , it has a short half - life , " said @entity12			0
" it does n't dwell in any biologic system , be it an adult , a child , a cow , for any significant period of time , and at those levels there 's no evidence that there 's any medical significance			2
" radiation gets into the milk because it falls on grass eaten by cows			1
the milk does not itself absorb radiation			1
@entity48 senior scientist @entity88 also said the findings are " minuscule " compared to what people experience every day			2
@entity0 gov. @entity92 said tests confirmed the milk is safe to drink			1
" this morning i spoke with the chief advisers for both the @entity10 and the @entity48 and they confirmed that these levels are minuscule and are far below levels of public health concern , including for infants and children , " @entity92 said in a statement			1
" according to them , a pint of milk at these levels would expose an individual to less radiation than would a five - hour airplane flight			2
" similarly , the @entity109 reassured residents that the levels do not pose a threat			0
" when radioactive material is spread through the atmosphere , it drops to the ground and gets in the environment			0
when cows consume grass , hay , feed , and water , radioactivity will be processed and become part of the milk we drink			2
however , the amounts are so small they pose no threat to public health , " the department said			0
at least 15 states have reported radioisotopes from @entity19 's crippled @entity134 nuclear plant in air or water or both			0
no states have recommended that residents take potassium iodide , a salt that protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine			0
@entity60 has been found in eastern states from @entity145 to @entity146 as well as in @entity148 states like @entity149 , @entity150 , and @entity9 , according to sensors and officials in those states			1
none of the levels poses a risk to public health , they said			0
at high levels , the isotope focuses on and accumulates in a person 's thyroid gland , @entity12 said			0
a medical test for thyroid health involves a person ingesting @entity60 and undergoing a nuclear scan to examine the gland			0
the @entity19 plant has been leaking radiation since it was damaged in a tsunami that followed a massive earthquake march 11			0
@entity1 's @entity172 and @entity173 contributed to this report .			0

isotope wo n't remain in *humans* ' or *animals* ' *digestive* systems , expert says
the @entity10 is increasing monitoring nationwide
a milk sample from @entity0 and @entity9 shows " minuscule amounts " of radiation
tests confirm the milk is safe to drink , officials say
