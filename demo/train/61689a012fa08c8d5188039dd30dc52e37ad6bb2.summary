@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 , a city of 8 million in eastern @entity1 , is the capital of the coastal @entity3			1
but some 80 years ago it was the capital of @entity1			1
the revolutionary @entity5 founded the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) here in 1912 after playing an instrumental role in overthrowing the @entity8 , the last of the @entity10 eras in @entity1			2
@entity5 's successor , @entity11 , headquartered his nationalist @entity13 ( @entity13 ) government here from 1927 until the @entity14 pushed them from the mainland in 1949 and moved the capital north to @entity17			1
this gave @entity0 , whose name literally means the " southern capital , " something of an identity crisis			1
but 64 years after the end of the @entity13 's rule , the city seems to have found its place again as a legacy of @entity29 , or the @entity6			1
from tourism to dining to real estate , many @entity0 businesses are selling themselves with a nod to the former capital 's nationalist past			1
the city 's main center of nightlife , known simply as 1912 , is named and themed after the founding year of the @entity6			0
located a stone 's throw from the @entity13 's @entity42 , century - old villas are revamped and dolled - up to house bars and restaurants			2
the complex boasts of its " classic @entity29 cultural significance " on its website			0
walking around the city 's commercial center , @entity49 , it 's common to see billboards and video screens advertising new real estate known for its " @entity29 flavor			0
" @entity56 was the city 's @entity57 in the early 20th century and is lined up with distinctive @entity29 - style architecture -- exquisite and painstakingly intricate @entity1 carvings decorate the otherwise @entity61 § ade			1
the quiet 500 - meter strip has in recent years been renovated by authorities to resemble its former @entity65 glory			0
while culture - lovers swarm here to trace @entity0 's olden - day charms , university graduates are often seen taking graduation photos in retro @entity65 - style outfits			1
instead of run - of - the - mill black robes , male students don @entity1 tunic suits , known as @entity5 suits , while females wear ocean - blue , wrap - up tops and black cotton skirts			2
enthusiasm for this era has also provided the most unlikely of job opportunities in @entity1			1
@entity84 , 46 , is a professional impersonator of @entity11 -- a controversial figure for many mainlanders			2
during the day he stands like a wax figure outside the @entity42			0
fully @entity11 - costumed , @entity84 charges tourists for taking photos with him			1
by night , the quiet @entity91 native ushers in guests at @entity93 , a @entity94 , still dressed as @entity11			2
" if we want to introduce the @entity97 to the public , we need to throw in a related experience , " explains general manager @entity95			0
" @entity11 is a famous character and people know about him			2
" the 150 - seat restaurant , whose per - head bill averages rmb 300 ( us $ 48 ) , serves food that was popular with nationalist officials			2
the menu includes yellow croaker soup , which was said to be @entity11 's favorite , and may - ling @entity109 , a meat dish designed by @entity11 's wife			2
the local communist government seems to encourage the cultural comeback			2
according to @entity116 , the president of @entity117 , the authorities have endeavored to popularize @entity65 food since 2011			0
a dozen restaurants in the city have been certified to carry the " @entity121			0
" " [ what we do is ] to pass on the dining culture of @entity0 and create a unique culinary signature of the city , " says @entity116			1
the well - groomed 56 - year - old former soldier owns @entity127 , a 4,000 - square - meter @entity0 restaurant devoted to researching , developing and cooking the cuisine , which comprise the prevailing governmental dishes of the time			2
each of the establishment 's 27 dishes is coupled with an interesting historical anecdote , often linked with influential @entity13 leaders , such as @entity5 and @entity137 , a noted @entity139 nationalist general			1
@entity116 spent approximately rmb 40 million ( us $ 6.4 million ) decorating the restaurant , which features colossal crystal chandeliers			0
the clientele are mostly businessmen , government employees and military officials			0
" commercial gimmicks are perhaps the most obvious part of [ this @entity65 cultural comeback ] , and it is best and most easily manifested through cuisine , " says media producer and culture consultant @entity145			0
@entity145 , 43 , came to @entity1 in 1993			0
the @entity152 has lived in @entity0 for the past decade and now edits , among other things , @entity155 - language magazine @entity154			1
this specific period attracts the locals because , according to him , it was when " the government really made the biggest bounds , greatest developments and smartest innovations in what was called the @entity165 from 1927 to 1937			0
" @entity166 also regards the nostalgic trend as a reflection of @entity0 's desire to find a new identity , when the provincial capital is often eclipsed by nearby @entity172 , which is a 90 - minute train ride to the southeast			1
@entity1 magazine @entity175 defined the @entity65 culture , or the " @entity65 feeling , " as an " aristocratic spirit			1
" in one article , the publication argued that modern @entity1 needed this lost essence because , for one reason , " the general social customs , taste and language are becoming coarse and vulgar			0
" the lengthy essay was later re-posted on the web edition of the state - run @entity190			0
" to some extent , it shows people partly recognize that era 's values , " says @entity6 culture specialist @entity192			0
although @entity192 declines to point out the specific values , a general consensus among the @entity1 public and media is that @entity65 times often embody openness , diversity , freedom and democracy , as an architect focusing on @entity65 times , 42 - year - old @entity192 has been involved in the restoration of many @entity29 buildings , including part of the @entity42			0
" on the other hand , it shows that people are connecting with their culture and history , " he adds			0
" here on the mainland , [ a certain incident in ] history caused a disruption to the passing of the traditional culture , but the @entity65 culture was in line with it , " he continues			0
" that 's why people resonate with that era 's culture			0
" according to @entity192 , the @entity65 culture never went extinct in @entity0 after 1949 , even though it did diminish			1
the city 's layout till today is based on the " @entity232 , " a blueprint drafted by the nationalist government from 1930 - 1937			1
as @entity11 's wife , @entity239 , once said : " we live in the present , we dream of the future and we learn eternal truths from the past			1
" this may well explain @entity0 's obsession with its @entity65 past .			1

@entity0 , a city of 8 million in eastern @entity1 , was *previously* the @entity1 capital
@entity11 headquartered his nationalist @entity13 government here until 1949
now the city is making a comeback thanks to its links with its *republican* past
tourists flock here to sample the food , music and culture of this era
