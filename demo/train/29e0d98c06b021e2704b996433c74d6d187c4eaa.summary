@entity0 -- president @entity3 's longtime legal mentor and current administration adviser has admitted privately telling him that justice @entity5 was " not nearly as smart as she seems to think she is			1
" constitutional scholar @entity8 's comment was in a letter to @entity3 in may 2009 , when @entity5 was being considered for the @entity11 appointment that later came to her			1
tribe " bluntly " suggested @entity5 would have a " negative impact " on the court because her " reputation as something of a bully " -- on her previous appeals court seat -- " could well make her liberal impulses backfire			1
" as a result , he concluded in his letter , the @entity21 native would have little influence to move the court away from its current conservative majority , led by chief justice @entity26			0
@entity8 also managed to criticize three sitting justices and offer negative comments on top finalists being considered at the time for the high court seat			1
the confidential letter was obtained and revealed thursday by conservative legal activist @entity32 , who writes the @entity34 blog for @entity35			0
@entity8 then confirmed the contents			1
@entity8 , who was an influential professor at @entity38 , made clear the purpose of his letter -- written on @entity38 stationary -- was to promote the candidacy of @entity42 , who had been @entity8 's boss as dean at the law school			1
" i ca n't think of anyone nearly as strong as @entity42 , whose combination of intellectual brilliance and political skill would make her a ten - strike , " wrote @entity8 , making a bowling reference			1
the president ultimately rejected @entity8 's advice , choosing @entity5 three weeks after the letter was written			1
@entity5 , the first @entity55 justice , is beginning her second year on the high court after replacing the retired @entity57			1
@entity42 was nominated in may of this year to take the @entity11 seat of @entity59			0
it is not known what specific influence tribe had on persuading the @entity62 to choose her			0
the two are longtime friends , beginning when @entity42 was a research assistant for the professor in the mid- 1980s			0
both left @entity38 last year to take jobs in the @entity68 -- @entity42 as solicitor general and @entity8 as a special adviser			1
@entity26 also has a connection to @entity8 ; he was a former student of the professor			1
sources close to the selection process have said @entity8 was intimately , if indirectly , involved in screening candidates for the 2009 and 2010 high court vacancies			1
he had been a longtime booster of @entity42 , so his comments in the letter are not surprising			2
what is unusual is the candid , often dismissive remarks he offered for various other candidates , and the fact the 69 - year - old academic chose to put it all in writing			0
in a statement e-mailed late thursday , @entity8 sought to clarify his earlier critiques			2
" reservations i expressed about @entity5 prior to her appointment were amply refuted by the closer study i was later able to give her record and that have been fully negated by her performance as a justice , " @entity8 said			1
on @entity100 - based federal appeals judge @entity98 , who administration sources have said came very close to being chosen over @entity42 -- @entity8 said she was " more powerful intellectually than @entity5 or any of the others mentioned as plausible prospects at the moment with the sole exception of @entity42			1
" but he said @entity106 at age 60 was a decade older than @entity42 and lacked a " dynamic personality or the extraordinary diplomatic gifts for inspiring confidence " that he believed @entity42 possessed			0
the professor said @entity113 gov. @entity112 would be a " dramatic appointment , " despite having no judicial experience and being born in @entity116			0
and @entity117 , former dean at @entity118 and a private attorney , " might be worth fighting for , " he said			0
@entity8 also found room to praise the retiring @entity57 , and offered his analysis of the current court , which he said was dominated by justice @entity123 , who often is the deciding , " swing " vote in key cases			2
@entity8 said @entity123 is " formalistic " in his legal thinking , and he tweaked justice @entity128 's conservative doctrine			2
the most blunt criticism was aimed at left - leaning justice @entity131 , whom @entity8 said had a pragmatism that was comparatively " mushy and constrained " in its approach to law and justice			2
" i think it 's clear that a @entity42 would be a much more formidable match for @entity128 than @entity131 has been , " @entity8 concluded			2
in his new statement , @entity8 said he has " long held " @entity131 and @entity123 in the " highest regard			2
" @entity11 spokeswoman @entity142 said neither @entity42 nor @entity5 had any response to the controversy			2
the @entity62 on friday emphasized the qualifications of both jurists and @entity3 's confidence in their service on the bench			0
@entity32 suggested in his blog that @entity8 may have promoted @entity42 's candidacy out of loyalty over a 2004 incident when she was his boss at @entity38			0
@entity8 admitted his 1985 book " @entity156 " had lifted large sections verbatim from a similar 1974 work by @entity159 , without giving proper credit			0
after an internal investigation , @entity42 reprimanded the professor for " a significant lapse in proper academic practice " but concluded that @entity8 's error was unintentional			0
@entity8 has written other legal books on constitutional issues , and has served as a private appellate attorney on several high - profile cases , including representing @entity171 during the 2000 election dispute			1
@entity8 concluded his 2009 letter to @entity3 with effusive praise			1
" i can hardly contain my enthusiasm at your first hundred days , " he told his former student			0
" i continue to hope that i can before too long come to play a more direct role " in the president 's administration			0
shortly thereafter , @entity8 was made " senior counselor for access to justice " in the @entity68 , tasked with increasing legal access for the poor			0
he has called @entity3 " the best student i ever had			0

constitutional scholar @entity8 said @entity5 could have a " negative impact "
he also was critical of three other justices and some being considered for appointment
his comments were in a letter to @entity3 in may 2009
