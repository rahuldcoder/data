fifty years ago this month , the @entity1 @entity0 heard oral argument in a libel case , @entity3 , that at the time few thought would go on to achieve landmark status			1
the @entity3 case , despite its roots in the early civil rights movement and the career of @entity11 , is still little - known outside legal and media circles			1
but as it marks its 50th anniversary , @entity3 deserves to be revisited			2
no contemporary @entity0 case has done more to define modern freedom of the press			1
these days , as the ongoing case of @entity20 of the @entity21 shows , reporters do have to worry that if they go too far in revealing embarrassing government secrets , they might find the government taking them to court to force them to reveal confidential sources			2
that is what has happened to @entity20 as a result of his investigation of a classified @entity31 program			0
what reporters do n't have worry about , though , as they once did , is government officials charging them with libel as a way of silencing their criticism			2
whether they acknowledge it or not , investigative reporters over the past half century -- from @entity41 and @entity42 in " @entity43 " to @entity44 in " @entity45 : the road from 9/11 to @entity52 " -- are indebted to the @entity0 's @entity3 ruling for the freedom they have had to challenge the government 's version of events			1
@entity3 had its origins in a fundraising ad , " @entity3 , " that the @entity56 to defend @entity11 and the @entity57 placed in the @entity21 on march 29 , 1960			1
opinion : for women , equal pay and economic justice are civil rights issues the committee -- which included @entity64 , president of the @entity66 , and entertainers such as @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 -- had been set up to raise money for @entity11 , whom an @entity73 grand jury had charged with tax evasion			1
" @entity3 " did not criticize any southerner by name , but it did speak of attacks on the civil rights movement by " @entity80 violators of the @entity81			1
" the ad became vulnerable to a libel suit because on a series of very specific points , it contained factual errors			2
the ad said that @entity11 had been arrested by @entity73 authorities seven times when he had been arrested only four times			1
the ad said that black students were expelled from @entity93 for a racial protest they held on the @entity96 steps , where they sang " @entity98			2
" in fact , the students sang the national anthem on the @entity96 steps , and they were expelled by the @entity101 for demanding service at a segregated lunch counter in the @entity104			0
the misstatements of fact were all comparatively minor , but they made the @entity21 vulnerable to legal action by @entity80 officials , who resented the prestigious paper for publishing " @entity3			1
" under @entity73 law , a resident could sue for libel when untruths that he believed defamatory were said about him			0
on april 19 , @entity3 , a @entity104 city commissioner whose particular duties included supervising the city 's police department , filed such a suit			1
@entity3 declared that misstatements about the police in @entity104 libeled him , even though they did not name him personally			2
he asked for damages of $ 500,000			0
soon after @entity3 filed his suit , @entity73 gov. @entity123 filed a $ 500,000 suit of his own , also claiming libel			2
before long , the @entity21 was facing $ 3 million in suits , a considerable sum in the 1960s			0
the implications of the suits were especially serious at a time when the civil rights movement was in its early stages			1
if liberal , @entity136 papers could be silenced in their criticism of the @entity80 as a result of libel suits , the civil rights movement faced tough going			1
when on april 12 and 13 , @entity142 wrote @entity21 stories critical of @entity144 , @entity73 , his reports brought with it a new set of libel suits			0
in @entity73 , which ever since @entity149 had been doing its best to resist the desegregation of its schools , @entity3 's case was quickly decided			1
an all - white jury , acting on instructions from a judge who told the jurors that a statement was libelous unless a defendant could prove it was true in all respects , took just two hours and 20 minutes to award @entity3 the $ 500,000 for which he asked			2
the libel award was the largest in @entity73 history , and on august 30 , 1962 , the @entity162 unanimously upheld the lower 's court 's judgment against the @entity21			0
the @entity162 's ruling was in keeping with tradition			0
@entity1 law had long held that libel , as did pornography , did not qualify for @entity171 protection			0
if the @entity21 were to win its appeal , the @entity0 would have to establish a new libel precedent			0
for a @entity0 that 10 years earlier in @entity149 had ruled that " separate but equal " had no place in @entity1 's public schools , overturning precedent was not out of the question , however			1
@entity178 was still chief justice			0
and after @entity180 , @entity181 's former secretary of labor , replaced @entity182 , a @entity183 appointee , the @entity179 of 1964 was , if anything , more liberal than the @entity179 of 1954			0
opinion : on @entity186 , helping the unemployed is a moral issue @entity178 assigned writing the opinion of the court in the @entity3 case to justice @entity191 , like himself an @entity193 appointee			1
by march 9 , when the court announced its ruling , the justices were unanimous in their decision to reverse the @entity199 ruling			0
as soon as @entity191 began reading from his opinion , it was clear that the @entity0 had taken a fresh look at libel law			0
" we are required in this case to determine for the first time the extent to which the constitutional protections of free speech and press limit a state 's power to award damages in a libel action brought by a public official against critics of his official conduct , " @entity191 observed in his very first sentence			1
these were words that @entity3 and the @entity80 did not want to hear , and as @entity191 continued reading from his opinion , it became clear that he and the @entity0 were distinguishing between a libel action brought by a private person and a libel action brought by a government official			1
to guarantee the @entity171 's effectiveness , a government official was not protected by the law in the same way that a private person was , @entity191 declared			0
for @entity191 , the historic basis for such a distinction went back to the notorious @entity234 of 1798 , which during the @entity236 administration of @entity237 made it a crime to utter or publish " false , scandalous and malicious " attacks against the government			0
fines levied in @entity234 prosecutions were later repaid by @entity244 on the grounds that the act was unconstitutional because of its violation of the @entity171 , and president @entity248 pardoned all who had been convicted and sentenced under the @entity234			0
the precedents contained in the repudiation of the @entity234 applied to the present , @entity191 insisted			0
for the @entity171 to remain meaningful , the only way a public official could be allowed to recover damages for a defamatory falsehood against him was if he could prove the falsehood was made with " ' actual malice ' -- that is , with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not			2
" requiring a government critic to guarantee the truth of all his factual assertions on pain of a libel judgment risked imposing , as @entity191 noted , " self - censorship			0
" the result was a legal threshold that made it very difficult to charge the critic of a government official with libel			0
in a front page story , times @entity0 reporter @entity275 , who would later write the definitive book on the @entity3 case , pointed out the @entity0 had established a new " constitutional landmark for freedom of the press and speech			1
" " the case could have an immediate impact on press coverage of race relations in the @entity80 , " @entity275 went on to say			1
what he could not foresee was how in subsequent decades @entity3 would also lessen the threats writers faced when they investigated the @entity293 , reports by @entity1 's @entity288 commanders of the number of enemy killed and the claims of the @entity298 administration that @entity295 's @entity294 possessed weapons of mass destruction .			2

@entity302 : landmark @entity3 case rooted in civil rights movement
he says @entity0 's decision upholding press freedom echoes for cases today
he says challenge was over an ad in raising money for defense of @entity11 in the @entity80
@entity316 : ad had errors ; court held public officials could n't *collect* damages if there was no malice
