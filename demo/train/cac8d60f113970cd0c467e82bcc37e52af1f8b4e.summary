on december 12 a bride and groom traveled to their wedding in @entity5 province , @entity6			1
it was supposed to be a day of celebration			0
instead , in a few seconds , their happiness was obliterated			0
a @entity12 drone fired at the wedding procession , destroying five vehicles and killing most of their occupants			1
not even the bride 's car , beautifully decorated with flowers , was spared from the carnage			0
senior @entity6 officials later admitted that the strike was a " mistake "			1
quite some mistake : although the bride survived , the strike killed 14 civilians and injured 22 more , according to officials -- the largest death toll by a drone attack in @entity6 since the program began in 2002			1
since the killings , a wave of outrage has swept across the country			0
the @entity6 government rushed to meet community elders , seeking to negotiate a quiet settlement for the killing of the bride 's loved ones			2
but the bereaved villagers rejected the overtures and instead demanded that president @entity43 stop @entity12 drone strikes before they would sit at any negotiating table			1
as ever , the @entity46 responded to press queries about the incident with only silence			0
@entity12 president @entity50 has issued no admission of responsibility , let alone an apology			2
only after recent evidence gathered from the scene by @entity57 did officials grudgingly admit that they would look into the strike			0
this is not the first time a @entity12 drone has killed civilians in al - baitha province			1
on september 2 , 2012 , a @entity12 drone hit a minibus near @entity66 , according to @entity6 officials			1
this time the vehicle was full of villagers carrying their day 's shopping			0
as usual the initial press coverage labelled the dead as " @entity74 militants , " but when the relatives threatened to deliver the bodies to the president 's gates , the @entity6 government was forced to concede that all 12 people killed were civilians			1
among the victims were a pregnant woman and three children			0
only recently , we had reason to hope for better			0
last month , @entity6 civil engineer @entity85 went to @entity86 , traveling over 7,000 miles in search of answers			0
he met @entity89 , senators , and even some @entity46 officials to describe how @entity12 drone strikes incinerated his nephew and brother - in - law at his son 's hometown wedding last year			1
in this strike two of the casualties were not only civilians , they were potential allies -- one was an imam who regularly preached against @entity74 ; the other was this small town 's only policemen			1
@entity85 received heartfelt condolences from many lawmakers			0
yet no official was prepared to explain why his relatives were killed , or why the @entity12 administration refused to acknowledge it had made a mistake			2
the use of drones in @entity6 might seem a simple , quick - fix option for @entity50			1
but with every civilian death , @entity74 's recruiting power increases			0
@entity115 , former @entity12 deputy chief of mission to @entity6 , recently reminded us of just that			1
asked whether the covert @entity12 drone war in @entity6 was creating more enemies than it removed , he concluded : " drone strikes take out a few bad guys to be sure , but they also kill a large number of innocent civilians			1
given @entity6 's tribal structure , the @entity12 generates roughly forty to sixty new enemies for every @entity128 operative killed by drones			1
" let me be clear : @entity133 , like the vast majority of my countrymen , reject terrorism			0
all of us were repulsed by footage of the gruesome @entity74 attack on a @entity139 hospital that left dozens dead in december			2
we agree that our fight against extremist groups can not be won without a variety of efforts , including robust law enforcement			0
but @entity12 drone strikes are exacerbating our problem by leaving families bereaved and entire villages terrified			1
drones destroy the fabric of @entity6 society			2
wronged and angry men are just the sort extreme groups like @entity74 in the @entity155 find easiest to recruit			2
our president may reassure the @entity12 of his support for drone strikes , but he does so in complete contradiction to the @entity6 people 's wishes			1
this year , two of @entity6 's greatest democratic institutions made this clear			0
@entity6 's @entity166 -- praised by @entity50 as a " historic " institution -- and the @entity6 @entity168 have both voted overwhelmingly to ban the use of drones			2
for a country so often divided , this unanimity from @entity6 's key democratic bodies shows the strength of public opinion against drones			2
but the people 's cries have been met only with more missiles raining down from the skies above			0
how can we in @entity6 build our fledgling democracy when our collective will is ignored by @entity185 democracy 's most powerful proponent ?			0

in december a @entity12 drone strike mistakenly *targeted* a wedding convoy in @entity6
the strike killed 14 civilians , outraging @entity6 , but @entity12 has failed to take responsibility
@entity194 : drones may seem like quick fix , but every errant strike helps @entity74 recruit
