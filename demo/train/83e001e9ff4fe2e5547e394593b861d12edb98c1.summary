@entity0 -- @entity3 nominee judge @entity2 years ago said she was a " product of affirmative action " when she was admitted to prestigious universities , but defended the contributions she offered as a @entity9 woman to classroom and workplace diversity			1
" i am the perfect affirmative action baby , " @entity3 nominee @entity2 said in the 1990s			1
the statements were part of newly released videos of speeches and panel discussions dating from the mid- 1980s that the 54 - year - old federal judge provided to the @entity19 , which will begin confirmation hearings july 13			1
the remarks offer often - candid insights into the @entity25 native 's views on the law , growing up poor in a @entity28 housing project , juggling a career and a social life , and her 1980s divorce			1
in an early 1990s panel with two other female judges , @entity2 talked about her educational background and how it helped her in her job as a federal trial judge in @entity37			1
" i am a product of affirmative action , " she said			2
" i am the perfect affirmative action baby			2
i am @entity40 , born and raised in the south @entity28			2
my test scores were not comparable to my colleagues at @entity43 and @entity44			2
not so far off so that i was n't able to succeed at those institutions			2
" she said that using " traditional numbers " from test scores , " it would have been highly questionable if i would have been accepted			2
" the female panel members politely objected to her characterizations of how she overcame such obstacles , pointing out she graduated from law school with honors and was on the prestigious law review			1
@entity2 countered that those were signs test scores alone do not offer the full measure of a person 's capability			1
test scores , she said , often can be the result of " cultural biases			0
" in a 1986 interview with @entity64 profiling young female professionals , @entity2 said she constantly had to deal with subtle forms of discrimination , particularly when it came to public perceptions			1
" i found in my experiences that it 's not that men are consciously discriminating against promoting women , but i do believe as people we have self - images about what 's good , " she said			0
" what 's quote - unquote a ' good ' lawyer , doctor , or whatever the profession is			0
and if you 're a male who grew up professionally in a male - dominated profession then your image of what a good lawyer is is a male image			0
" years later on the federal bench , @entity2 said she encountered similar treatment from older white men particularly , who seemed to speak longer to her than other lawyers			1
she said the impression she got was that was because she was a woman and a minority			1
@entity2 has been criticized by some conservatives for her remarks on diversity , and her 2001 comment that she " would hope that a wise @entity101 woman , with the richness of her experiences , would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life			1
" in the legal panel , she rejected suggestions that minorities should accept " selection by merit alone			2
" she noted , " it is critical that we promote diversity " by giving women and minorities more opportunities in the law and the judiciary			0
" since i have difficulty defining merit and what merit alone means -- and in any context , whether it 's judicial or otherwise -- i accept that different experiences in and of itself , bring merit to the system , " she said			1
" i think it brings to the system more of a sense of fairness when these litigants see people like myself on the bench			1
" as a judge she offered a variety of thoughts on how a judge should act on the bench			0
" i have to unhook myself from my emotional responses and try to stay within my unemotional objective persona , " she told a group of @entity9 lawyers in 2000			0
she said in 1994 that such an attitude can be hard to maintain , when as a trial judge she had to deal with some defendants and their families			0
" i watch those mothers cry and i ca n't help but feel their pain			0
does that translate into a passion or compassion that affects my judgment ? no , but it makes it much more important for me to be careful when i exercise my judgment			0
" in another panel she noted that she sometimes spoke to some defendants and their families in @entity158 in civil cases , to keep them informed of what she was doing			2
she said she made sure to translate what she was saying into @entity162			0
in several events she said the life of a lawyer is rarely glamorous			0
in a 1986 interview she admitted her divorce was caused in part by her commitment to her career , and that her subsequent social life had suffered as a result			1
and as she grew into her 30s , she lamented her earlier expectations had to that point not been fully realized			0
" i 'm very happy with where i am at this point in my life but i think my expectations were greater in ' 76 , " when she graduated from @entity43			0
" i mean , i really expected to turn the world on fire			0
