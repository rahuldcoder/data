-- is @entity1 the most powerful woman in @entity4 business ? she 's got to be up there			1
this is the chief executive of the country 's second largest bank -- @entity9 -- overseeing a whopping us $ 613 billion in assets and over 36,000 employees			1
it 's quite a portfolio , and all the more impressive considering the 57 - year - old mother - of - four started out as a bank teller a little over 30 years ago			1
born in @entity15 to @entity17 parents , @entity1 originally taught @entity18 at high schools , before working at @entity20 in @entity21 -- becoming head of human resources just five months after giving birth to triplets			1
the family moved to @entity27 and in 2002 @entity1 became the first female ceo of a major @entity4 bank -- the @entity29			1
today she is the 62nd most powerful woman in the world , according to @entity31 , but admits the notoriously male - dominated banking world has been a " tough area to crack			1
" now the boss at @entity9 , @entity1 made it her mission to have 40 % women in senior management positions by 2014 -- a target she smashed in 2012			1
how has she achieved her phenomenal success and what is her vision for the future of @entity4 's oldest bank ? @entity0 's leading women sat down with the financial trailblazer to find out			1
" i grew up in a very strong , nuclear family			0
my father was a sportsman			0
he represented @entity15 in a couple of sports , so he was a very positive person and someone who encouraged you to be your best and give your best with everything that you do			0
and so i grew up in this environment that was nurturing , supporting , but certainly encouraging			0
" " 42 % of our management team are women			1
so we 've reset the goal to 50 % by 2017			1
because that 's when @entity9 becomes 200 years old as an institution -- the oldest bank , and indeed the oldest company in @entity4			1
so that 's a lovely point to reflect on			1
" " when i got to be a ceo i said : ' right			2
i 'm now going to tackle gender inequality head - on			2
i 'm going to make a difference , and lead by example , and actively put in place policies and practices to support women			2
' " " the banking world is a particularly tough area to crack for women			1
i was in a forum yesterday where there would have been 60 leaders of banks and insurance companies and i was literally the only woman			2
" " my husband being a paediatrician was awesome			0
with four children -- three of them triplets -- i needed a lot of help and support at home			0
he did more than his fair share of everything in the home and i could not have done what i 've done without that			0
" " @entity94 was an outstanding leader and a mentor for me			0
i was in @entity15 at the time he was released			0
i was in @entity15 when he was inaugurated as the first president			0
and he - after the 27 years of imprisonment , a lot of it in solitary confinement - truly understood that his vision , his purpose , was to transform @entity15 , a reconciled @entity15			2
" " my advice would be : dig deep			0
gather all your courage in your hands			0
you 've been offered this opportunity because you are worthy			0
you do n't have to be 100 % ready for this job			2
you do n't have to be 80 % ready for this job			2
you do need support around you and you do need a determination and a preparedness to work hard			0
" debate : is @entity4 politics too blokey ? learn : five things you did n't know about @entity118			1
