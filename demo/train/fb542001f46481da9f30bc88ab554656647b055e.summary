he 's only 3 years old , but @entity1 is already the focus of a medical marijuana fight in @entity4			1
@entity1 has acute lymphocytic leukemia , or all , a cancer of the blood and bone marrow			1
it 's the most common cancer in children			2
his mother says his condition has improved so much following treatment with medical marijuana that chemotherapy is n't needed			1
but the @entity4 of @entity4 , she says , disagreed			0
it all started back in september 2012			0
@entity1 , then 2 , was living with his mother , @entity17 , in @entity18 , @entity19 , when he developed a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes			1
the emergency room doctor said it was a virus and sent him home			0
two days later he went back			0
" they thought it was either a virus or infection in the lymph nodes , so they gave him some antibiotics , " @entity17 says			1
but on the fifth day , his mother says she was changing his diaper and noticed his groin was also swollen , as well as his abdomen and throat			0
he was having trouble breathing			0
that time , she got a frightening diagnosis : cancer			0
@entity41 governor announces plan for medical marijuana at hospitals @entity1 was flown to a children 's hospital in @entity46			1
" his whole chest was full of leukemia tumors , which is why he could n't breathe , " his mother says			2
" they started him on chemo , but told us that he probably was n't going to make it			2
" @entity1 's cancer had quickly progressed , leading doctors to give him an 8 % chance of survival , she says			1
in general , all is one of the most curable cancers			0
according to the @entity63 , more than 90 % of children diagnosed with the disease survive			0
chemotherapy is the standard treatment , and @entity1 says doctors put @entity1 on a four - year treatment plan			1
the first two months of chemo went fairly well , but then @entity1 became extremely ill. " most days he could n't get off the couch , " @entity1 remembers			1
" he would just lay there and throw up and throw up			0
" @entity1 says he also developed neuropathy -- a symptom of nerve damage that can cause weakness , numbness and pain -- in his legs that left him barely able to walk			1
around that time , a friend set up a @entity82 page called @entity83 for @entity1 , and recommendations started streaming in , including several endorsing cannabis -- medical marijuana -- as a treatment			1
medical marijuana , however , is n't legal in @entity19			1
still , desperate for answers , @entity17 and her mother , @entity89 , started looking into it			1
they considered going to @entity93 or @entity94			0
then their research led them to the @entity99 brothers in @entity4			0
the six brothers are one of that state 's biggest cannabis growers and dispensary owners			0
the @entity104 produce about 500 pounds of medical marijuana a year			1
at the time , much of it was high in @entity107 -- tetrahydrocannabinol , the psychoactive ingredient in pot that gets users high but also helps patients with an array of conditions including pain and nausea			0
but the @entity104 were also growing something quite revolutionary : a plant cross-bred to reduce the @entity107 and increase another compound found in cannabis called cannabidiol , or @entity122			0
many researchers believe @entity122 is one of the compounds in marijuana that has medicinal benefits			2
according to the @entity129 , it 's thought to have significant analgesic , anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activity without the psychoactive effect			0
the @entity104 expect to produce over 1,000 pounds this year , most of it the cross-bred variety , according to @entity99			0
dr. @entity138 : why i changed my mind on weed @entity1 , herself a recovering heroin addict , struggled with the idea of giving @entity146 marijuana			1
" i was telling my mom , you know , ' we really need to think about this			2
' " but , says @entity1 , her son was already prescribed medications like @entity154 and morphine -- medications with significant side effects			1
@entity1 suffered from stomach failure , and " the @entity154 made him so miserable , when he had hair , he would literally try to pull his hair out			1
" in the end , she decided she had nothing else to lose and moved to @entity4			0
she rented a room , got @entity1 's medical marijuana card and began giving him marijuana -- @entity107 for the pain and nausea , but also @entity122			1
the dose was based on @entity1 's weight			1
he first took it in oil form , but now takes a pill			0
once the doses started , " @entity1 's ( red and white blood cell ) counts increased dramatically , " she says			1
six months later , encouraged by @entity1 's progress , she stopped his chemotherapy treatments completely			1
" once i took the chemo out , i see these amazing results			2
and no more need for blood transfusion and platelet transfusions , " @entity1 says			1
" i think that the chemo in combination with the cannabis did put him into remission and now the cannabis will keep him there			1
" but @entity1 's doctor at the @entity4 of @entity4 was shocked			1
" she told me with no uncertainty that if i refused chemo , she would have no choice but to report me to the proper authorities , " @entity1 says			1
so @entity1 found a lawyer willing to take her case			1
" nobody wants to hurt @entity1 here , " says attorney @entity199			1
" this is about making him better			0
we have no problem making sure he 's monitored throughout this process			0
and again , if there 's any indication this is doing him harm , i ca n't imagine @entity17 doing anything other than the right thing			1
" medical marijuana helps stem 6 - year - old 's seizures @entity4 , in a statement , says it is " committed to protecting the well - being of our patients			1
" the hospital says it can not discuss specific cases , but provided information from dr. @entity222 , director of the hospital 's @entity223			2
hunger noted that childhood cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease among @entity231 children ; that about 25 % of childhood cancers are all ; and that the survival rate for children with all treated by @entity236 research trials is over 90 % , attained with two to three years of chemotherapy			0
@entity4 is " one of the largest centers in the country that treats children with all , " the statement says			0
" @entity243 at @entity4 has always done its best to work closely with families to provide the most appropriate treatment for cancer , while also seeking to minimize side effects and maximize quality of life			0
" today , chemotherapy is a required part of therapy for children with leukemia			2
many supportive care medications are used in children and adults with cancer , including those considered to be complementary and alternative medicine ( also referred to as integrative health )			0
" marijuana or a product derived from marijuana is often used to decrease side effects in adults with cancer , " the hospital says			1
" there are several @entity271 - approved and commercially available anti-nausea medicines derived from marijuana ( cannabinoids ) that are frequently used by adults and children with cancer , and we often prescribe these medications			2
" in an effort to stave off a legal wrangle , @entity1 , her mother and @entity199 met with the doctors in charge of @entity1 's care in october			1
" they said they were willing to work with us			0
they said they were willing to alter the chemo plan , and they did not , " @entity1 says			1
child protective services -- which @entity1 says had already been notified and visited the family 's home -- was also at the meeting , along with dr. @entity299 , who wrote @entity1 's original prescription for marijuana and is monitoring his care			1
" i could see a large gulf between the doctors who were making the point this is a fatal disease -- ' you know , he needs this treatment to survive , ' and pretty much that was their stance , " says @entity299			0
" the family wanted to discuss more alternative modes of treatment and really things that would n't make him so sick , but again , the doctors being convinced that really it had to be done the way that they were used to it ( being done ) -- that just made it very much really a confrontation there of two different mindsets			0
i felt sympathetic to both			0
" child protection officials declined comment on the case			2
the @entity63 , meanwhile , cautions that cannabinoids have not been tested in humans to determine if they can lower cancer risk			0
" there are many challenges with marijuana research as it relates to cancer , " the organization says in a statement			2
" while it shows promise for controlling cancer pain among some patients , there is still concern that marijuana may cause toxic side effects in some people and that the benefits of @entity107 must be carefully weighed against its potential risks			2
there is no available scientific evidence from controlled studies in humans that cannabinoids can cure or treat cancer			0
" is medical marijuana safe for children ? for now , @entity1 is still in remission with no sign of recurrence			1
still , @entity358 is cautious and says she ca n't recommend cannabis over chemo			2
" when you look at children who go through that same course of treatment and compare @entity1 to them , it seems like he 's doing better than what would be expected , " she says			2
" i 'm very hopeful and very encouraged that the @entity122 is probably having a beneficial effect for him , but i think we 're still looking to have the disease course play out and find out			0
i think in cancer , you do n't really know until later			0
" meanwhile , @entity199 says child protection officials have not yet filed a case			2
" we will continue to monitor @entity1 's health , make sure he 's getting the proper blood tests and other checks to see what 's going on with him healthwise , " he says			2
in december , @entity17 notified @entity1 's doctors that she plans to transfer his care			1
she 's searching for a physician willing to work with her to reduce the amount of steroids and chemotherapy he takes			0
@entity89 says they have no regrets and will continue to fight			0
" it 's not just fighting for @entity1			2
it 's not just about him , it 's about all of the kids to come , " she says			0
" when @entity1 is 15 years old and we talk about this , i want @entity1 to know that we did everything in our power to be compassionate in his care and to protect him			2
