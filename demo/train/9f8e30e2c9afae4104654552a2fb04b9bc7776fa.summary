" we both feel that the time is right for @entity3 to have a fresh challenge , " @entity12 said			1

" we are talking to @entity68			0
i 'd like him to stay			0
his experience is important but he has real drive and determination that is still increasing , " said @entity12			0
" he is the one in our dressing room that can truly say he has played at the highest level -- in @entity89 , in @entity82 , in cup finals and so on			0
" we have to negotiate and see where we go , but players have to want to stay here and we have to want to keep them			0
" @entity68 has been here a long time so he has to decide if he needs a fresh challenge , whether what we are trying to do is going to excite him , whether he feels he is going to be appreciated here			2
" @entity12 also confirmed they have offered striker @entity96 and right - back @entity98 one - year extensions to their current deals , which run out this summer			0
@entity7 @entity101 has changed his mind about retiring and says he will play for @entity104 club @entity103 again next season			1
the 36 - year - old had decided to quit after @entity103 were denied the title because @entity108 were awarded three points for a game they lost after the opposing team fielded an ineligible player			2
" the truth is that at the end of the championship , i felt great disappointment and a ( sense of ) injustice , but the love and support i have received from fans and the team have contributed to my final decision ... i have decided to stay at @entity103 next season , " @entity101 said in a statement on the club 's web site			1
@entity108 lost 1 - 0 on february 3 , but @entity104 sports authorities gave them the points because @entity130 played @entity131 who had turned out for two other clubs during the season			2
