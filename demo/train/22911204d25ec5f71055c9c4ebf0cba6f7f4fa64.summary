@entity1 radio host @entity0 has interviewed some of pop culture 's biggest names , from @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 to @entity8 and @entity9 , and that 's just in the past few months			1
his @entity12 show , " q with @entity0 , " is one of the most popular in the network 's history , making him a bona fide celebrity in a country that takes pride in its public radio			1
it aired on more than 180 public radio stations in the @entity23 , prompting the @entity24 to call it " the most popular new arts and culture radio show in @entity23 " in 2013			1
still , the 47 - year - old was far from a household name in the @entity23 when he posted a lengthy screed on his @entity32 page sunday accusing the @entity12 of firing him for his " private sex life			1
" he said the dismissal came after he shared details of his sex life with his former employers to head off a smear campaign by " jilted " exes accusing him of nonconsensual kinky activity			1
the combination of @entity1 celebrity , an iconic @entity1 institution and allegations from anonymous women produced what one columnist called " a @entity1 sex scandal the likes of which we have n't seen in decades			1
" the size of @entity0 's star and the seriousness of the allegations makes this bigger than your run of the mill celebrity sex scandal , with implications beyond @entity1			1
two major issues reside at the heart of the scandal : a $ 55 million lawsuit against the @entity12 in which @entity0 alleges that he was fired for his sexual proclivities , and anonymous allegations reported by the @entity68 from three women accusing @entity0 of sexual violence and nonconsensual bdsm activity			1
the @entity12 released a statement saying the decision was " not made without serious deliberation and careful consideration " and declined to comment further			1
@entity0 denies the allegations and says any sexual activity between him and the women , kinky or not , was consensual			1
" let me be the first to say that my tastes in the bedroom may not be palatable to some folks			2
they may be strange , enticing , weird , normal , or outright offensive to others , " he said in his @entity32 post			2
" but that is my private life			0
that is my personal life			0
and no one , and certainly no employer , should have dominion over what people do consensually in their private life			0
" by bringing @entity95 into the mix through his @entity32 post , @entity0 ignited conversation in legal circles and the kink community over whether the " kinky defense " will prevail in his lawsuit and the court of public opinion			1
the scandal is of particular interest to the kink community , who say it raises two common topics of concern in their world : discrimination over sexual activity , and the gray area between consensual activity and assault in @entity95			1
others worry about the potential for the " kinky defense " to be misappropriated and used as a shield for rape and assault			0
" it hits on a lot of important aspects that @entity95 faces , " said @entity120 , spokeswoman for @entity121 , an advocacy group that promotes tolerance of sexual minorities			2
" rarely do you have an instance where so many things come together			0
' do n't hate me for being kinky ' in his @entity32 post , @entity0 says he has always been interested in a variety of sexual activities but only those that " are mutually agreed upon , consensual , and exciting for both partners			1
" he suggested that the coming days would bring allegations " of unsavory aggressive acts in the bedroom " with the implication that they happened " nonconsensually			2
" " and it will be based in lies but damage will be done , " @entity0 said			1
his publicist declined to comment further , referring @entity145 to his @entity32 post			0
scores of fans have called for his reinstatement through online petitions to get him back on air			0
the kink community also has rallied to support @entity0 as one of their own , saying his plight drew attention to some of the more serious consequences the bdsm community faces for its lifestyle , particularly when it comes to job security , divorce proceedings and custody disputes			1
polyamory : when three is n't a crowd for others , it brought mainstream attention to ongoing " difficult " conversations within the kink community about how to deal with breaches of consent , @entity1 writer and sex educator @entity173 said			2
" it 's a twofold concern ; it 's important that we have conversations within the kink community about consent and negotiations and the reality that does happen within the kink community " she said			0
" at the same time we also need to constantly battle public perception of kink as being inherently abusive			2
" in a blog post that spread as the scandal unfolded , " poor persecuted perv , " @entity173 cautioned against rallying around @entity0 or anyone who uses the " kinky defense " until all the facts are in			1
" a danger inherent in this kind of media - message success is that the ' do n't hate me for being kinky ' defense will be used by people who perpetrate nonconsensual violence , and that we , as a community , will stand by uncritically -- or worse , cry out in support -- as victims of violence are once again silenced			2
" @entity173 called it a " major triumph " for the kink community that @entity0 took a gamble on the " consensual kink " argument outweighing the " you 're a filthy pervert " reaction in the court of public opinion			1
regardless of the outcome , she hopes the mainstream remembers that it 's not what people do behind closed doors that matters , but how they do it			0
" is everyone having fun and enjoying themselves ? is something in place to help catch them if they fall ? " she said			0
@entity95 : a culture of consent responsible bdsm practitioners participate in what 's called " consent culture , " where verbal discussion of boundaries and expectations are carefully negotiated ahead of time , said @entity232 , an @entity233 sex educator who leads talks about responsible @entity95			2
the conversation between the dominant and the submissive generally goes something like : what are you looking for out of this scene ? what do you think i can supply you with ? is there anywhere i 'm not allowed to touch you ? is there any level of nudity you are not comfortable with ? safe words are agreed upon to let the person know when to stop , whether they 're stoplight colors or actual words			0
the bottom line : " the person in the submissive position always has the right to use the safe word , " she said			0
they can stop the scenario , no questions asked			0
" if i have you bound and gagged and you ca n't use the safe word , i still have 100 % responsibly to give you some way to say that 's not ok , " @entity232 said			0
" if i fail to do that and you ca n't tell me or if i ca n't understand , it is my failure , not yours			0
" as with any community , there are unscrupulous members who seek to exploit others , and survivors are not always treated with respect , she said			0
case law in the @entity23 says that consent is not a defense to assault where great bodily harm has occurred , said @entity278 , whose organization works with the bdsm community to report assault to police when it crosses the line			0
that 's why breath - play ( covering mouths , choking ) and hitting with a closed fist can be risky , especially for people starting out , she said			2
some educators recommend against those activities altogether			0
but consent to rough sexual activity that does not cause serious bodily harm is not assault , she said			1
" people like intense physical sensations , they like extreme sports , and they like extreme sex , " she said			2
" they can play with each other and give each other intense sensations , but they ca n't seriously harm each other			0
