@entity1 , @entity0 -- social networking , @entity4 and cinema classics on demand : this is the enticing mix on offer at new movie web site @entity9			1
the @entity9 mastermind @entity10 ( center ) at @entity12 with @entity14 ' @entity13 ( left ) and @entity4			1
the self - styled " online cinematheque " allows users to watch art house films from directors like @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , while @entity22 - style profile pages and discussion forums encourage movie debate			1
with their innovative approach , the @entity9 hope to introduce art house cinema to a whole new audience			1
recently , the @entity9 announced a prestigious partnership with another more widely known auteur : @entity4			1
the site is collaborating with @entity4 's @entity32 ( @entity33 ) -- an organization dedicated to restoring lost cinema classics from around the world -- to exhibit the refurbished masterpieces online			1
the first four rescued works from @entity4 's project are currently available to watch for free on the @entity9 web site			1
among them are @entity42 domestic thriller " @entity43 " ( 1960 ) and " @entity44 " ( 1973 ) , a documentary about pioneering @entity47 band @entity48 , famously described by @entity4 as " the @entity49 of @entity50			1
" watch a clip from " @entity43 " watch a clip from " @entity44 " " it is really exciting and important to have @entity4 preserving the films he is preserving , " said one of the masterminds behind @entity9 , @entity55 , over the phone from @entity57			1
" as he said , it 's not only important to preserve , but to show -- and he chose @entity9 because of our look and feel and our philosophy and concept			1
" the basic ambition behind @entity9 is to make high quality cinema accessible to a young , global audience by making it available on demand cheaply			1
" if you are not in @entity75 , @entity1 , @entity57 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , or @entity79 , forget it , " @entity10 told @entity2 over the phone from @entity72 , @entity73			0
" many of these films you can not get even on dvd if you are living in @entity83 , in @entity84 , in @entity85 or @entity86			0
" the @entity9 is @entity10 's brainchild : an ambitious former @entity89 banker with a head for technology , he came up with the idea back in 2007 in @entity77 when , with some spare time on his hands , he tried to watch @entity94 's " in the @entity95 " on the @entity96			2
" it was very simple			0
i went online and i did not find a place that i could use , " he says			0
he started writing his business plan there and then			0
@entity10 says he knew that if he was going to succeed in his quest to bring quality cinema to the global village he would have to enlist some of the industry 's top brass			0
enter @entity107 millionaire , @entity55 of @entity108 , the company behind 2007 @entity111 winner " @entity112 , " and @entity13 of @entity78 - based distributor @entity14 which represents films like @entity115 's " a prophet , " which won the @entity117 at @entity118 this year			2
@entity55 and @entity13 have instilled the site with their film knowledge , and paved the way for the site 's other major collaboration with masters of the vintage re-release , the @entity127			2
each month , the @entity127 curates a free online film festival making available classic films from its large library on the @entity9			1
this month , users can watch @entity136 's 1960 classic " @entity134 " or " @entity137 " ( 1962 ) by @entity133 master @entity132			0
of course , all this begs the question : is there really a big appetite for auteur - driven feature films outside the lofty but limited cinephile circles -- especially at a time when studio - driven blockbuster fodder like " x-men origins : @entity149 " and " @entity150 " dominate at the box office ? " i want to create an entirely new audience for these films , " says @entity10			0
" because the only thing people in much of the world are exposed to is " @entity156 " or " @entity157 " in their local multiplex			0
" the @entity9 is one of a number of web sites , like @entity163 , making previously hard - to - find films available on the internet since the @entity167 revolution paved the way for new ways of consuming video on the @entity171			1
the @entity9 ' particular niche is auteur - driven cinema combined with social networking : " putting the films online is only part of it			1
the moment you put the film in the existing conversation between people that know each other , then you create a platform for discovery			2
according to @entity10 , what sets the site apart from the others is quality : each film is individually encoded ( compared to most sites , which batch encode films ) for the web which he says gives a higher quality of sound and vision than anywhere else on the @entity171			1
" being the best in the world has a huge premium and i know that we can be the best in the world , " said @entity10			0
the site is cleanly designed , easy to navigate and you can pay to watch films like 1998 dogme 95 classic " @entity209 " by @entity211 director @entity210 and " @entity212 , " ( 2003 ) an unsettling examination of the pre-eminence of big business			2
currently there are 200 films available to watch , some free , but mostly for around $ 5			0
@entity55 says he hopes to increase the number of films to 1,000			0
despite the unabashedly highbrow aims of the site , both @entity220 and @entity55 realize they will need to include more commercial fare if they want to increase membership of the site which currently stands at around 80,000			0
" it is important we start getting some major films , " said @entity55			0
" not only treasures that @entity4 restores but also some films that are more commercial			2
" @entity10 says he would love to host quality studio films like the @entity231 's " @entity230 , " oscar - winner " @entity233 , " and @entity235 's " @entity234			0
" but there are limits : " i will never put a mainstream film that is purely for entertainment ; that has no soul on the site			2
" you will never see ' @entity244 ' or ' @entity156			0

@entity4 collaborates with web site @entity9 to put restored films online free
the movie masterpieces were restored by @entity4 's @entity32
they include @entity42 film " @entity43 " and @entity47 documentary " @entity44 "
the @entity9 is an innovative mix of social networking and video on demand
