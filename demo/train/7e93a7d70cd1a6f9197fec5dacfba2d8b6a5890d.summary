@entity0 -- royal watchers eagerly await the arrival of a child that will be heir to the @entity7 throne			1
here 's what you need to know and the latest developments : @entity11 is among those keen for the new baby to greet the world			1
on a visit to northern @entity16 wednesday , she was asked by a little girl whether she wants her great - grandchild to be a boy or a girl			2
the queen replied : " i do n't think i mind			1
i would very much like it to arrive			0
i 'm going on holiday			0
" @entity23 of @entity24 is now overdue			0
a royal source tells @entity1 that her due date was july 13			1
she and prince @entity27 announced at the start of the year that the baby was due in july , but did not announce the date			0
prince @entity32 ' wife @entity31 , said monday that the family was on tenterhooks for the baby 's arrival -- and suggested it could be very soon			1
" we 're all waiting at the end of a telephone , " she said , in an exchange filmed by @entity38			0
" i hope by the end of the week , he or she will be there			0
" the baby will have the title @entity53 prince or @entity50 ( the baby 's name ) of @entity24 , @entity48 said this month			1
however , it could be as long as 10 days before the baby 's name is announced			1
speculation on what that name will be is rife -- and betting is going strong			0
bookies ' favorites include @entity62 , @entity11 or @entity63 for a girl , and @entity65 or @entity66 for a boy			1
anyone born in @entity7 on the same day as @entity27 and @entity70 's baby will receive a special coin from the @entity72 : a silver penny , dated 2013 , that will come in a blue pouch for a boy or a pink one for a girl			1
@entity70 is expected to give birth at the private @entity79 wing of @entity80 , next to @entity81 in @entity0			1
it 's where @entity27 was born			0
@entity70 's mother , @entity84 , is likely to be on hand at the hospital			1
the first indication that the baby is on its way will be an announcement in the media that the duchess has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor , royal sources tell @entity1			2
the next public announcement is expected to be that of the birth			2
it will be made in the form of a formal bulletin , signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to @entity105			0
there , the notice will be placed in a gilt frame positioned on an easel -- the same one used to announce @entity27 's birth -- and placed in the palace forecourt for all to see			2
the first to know about the royal baby will be @entity11 , prime minister @entity113 and the governors general of each of the commonwealth nations , along with the rest of the royal and @entity84 families			1
if the baby arrives in the middle of the night , it 's unlikely the queen will be awoken , so there is a chance in that instance that an official announcement will not be made until the following morning			2
celebratory gun salutes will be sounded by the @entity129 in @entity130 ( 41 rounds ) and the @entity132 at the @entity133 ( 62 rounds ) after the baby is born			0
@entity27 and @entity70 did not want to know the sex of their baby beforehand , royal sources say			1
there has been speculation it is a girl , however , especially after a member of the public said in march that the duchess almost uttered " daughter " while at a public event in @entity146			0
the woman said the duchess was given a teddy bear and replied , " thank you , i will take that for my d -- " but then stopped herself			0
the baby will be third in line to the throne after @entity32 and prince @entity27 , regardless of gender			0
a rule change in 2011 ended centuries of male primogeniture , which decreed that the crown passed to the eldest son and was bestowed on a daughter only when there were no sons			0
it means that if the next royal baby is a girl , she will eventually become queen ; previously , a younger male sibling would have taken precedence			1
the queen 's cousin , @entity172 , told @entity1 's @entity174 she hoped the child would have a normal childhood			2
" i imagine and hope that its early life , until it 's at least in its teens , will be just a jolly , happy , ordinary child 's life , " she said			0
it 's not known where the @entity182 and @entity183 plan to spend the days and weeks following the birth			1
@entity27 is expected to be given the usual paternity leave of two weeks by the @entity188 , royal sources say			2
he will then return to his job as a helicopter search and rescue pilot			0
the revelation that @entity70 was pregnant came after she was admitted to a @entity0 hospital in december for acute morning sickness .			2

new : the queen does n't mind if the baby 's a boy or a girl -- she just wants it to arrive soon
a royal source says @entity70 , the @entity183 , is overdue
she is expected to give birth at the private @entity79 wing of @entity80
