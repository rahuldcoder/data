-- in the wake of this month 's @entity4 report graphically detailing acts of torture by the @entity7 at @entity8 and elsewhere , the @entity1 announced it is actively investigating collusion of its members with the torture program at @entity8			2
meanwhile , a decision last week by my own professional association , the @entity13 , or @entity13 , suggests that impunity for all may be the order of the day			1
despite years of advocacy and formal requests , the @entity13 -- which claims as its members a majority of the roughly 110,000 architects in the @entity19 -- has officially declined to add specific language to its code of ethics that would prohibit the design of torture chambers in @entity19 prisons and around the world			1
in doing so , it cites anti-trust concerns and the potential difficulty of enforcing the prohibition , but it ignores the claims of human rights			2
to be sure , the @entity13 's ethics code contains aspirational language that broadly states , " members should uphold human rights in all their professional endeavors			1
" contrast that , for example , with the code of the @entity41 or the @entity42 , which reads , " the physician shall not provide any premises , instruments , substances , or knowledge to facilitate the practice of torture			1
" that leaves providing the premises for torture up to us architects , and as far as the @entity13 is concerned , we are open for business			1
yes , the prisons at @entity8 had architects			2
the design of @entity59 was based on the @entity60 , @entity61 , jail , according to its architect			0
other camps were built with prefabricated steel prison cells , a popular jail - building technology that may well have been used to construct the @entity7 's " black site " prisons overseas			0
the only apparent justification for the additional expense and complexity of building on such remote sites with no access to local labor or building materials was that these were places where the legal system could not interfere with indefinite detention and " enhanced interrogation techniques			0
" the @entity13 's decision not to prohibit design for torture is not just about a handful of egregious projects , however , despite the horrific and planned - for consequences for some of the occupants taken to those buildings			1
it 's also about the design of spaces in more conventional prisons intended for prolonged solitary confinement : a practice roundly regarded as a form of torture by @entity95 , @entity96 and the @entity97 on @entity98			2
these organizations are but some of the human rights advocates that wrote letters urging the @entity13 to enact a prohibition			1
here in the @entity19 , about 20,000 people are held in solitary confinement in one of 45 or so specially designed " supermax " prisons , and some 60,000 more are held in " segregation wings " and " security housing units " in state prisons and " the hole " in county jails			0
while architects can not be held responsible for unintended uses of the spaces they design , the intention of most of these spaces is clear from the get - go			2
the use of remote - controlled doors , individualized cellular " recreation yards " and solid cell fronts with special pass - through slots are all architectural features that enable and deepen isolation , leading inexorably to psychological pain			0
half of all prison suicides happen to the approximately 4 % of people in solitary confinement			0
architecture facilitates this suffering and these deaths			0
in the face of the @entity4 's torture report , citizens can by and large only watch the different branches of government contest what happened			2
but just as all @entity19 are stained and put at risk by our country 's reputation for torture , all of us have opportunities within the multiple roles we play in life to reject torture and enact accountability			0
as citizens , it is our responsibility to vote out torturers and to demand prosecutions of perpetrators so that torture will never happen again			1
likewise , all licensed professionals have a responsibility to protect the health , safety and welfare of the public			1
and , for me and my fellow architects , we must further protect our values by changing building codes and industry standards as new challenges emerge ( often after a major building disaster )			1
the unwillingness of @entity19 's leading architectural association to prohibit the design of torture facilities is a shocking , shameful and deeply troubling statement			0
it refuses to place any limit on the potential role of design in human rights violations , even the most egregious			0
unless and until the @entity13 revisits the issue , @entity19 architects are represented by a professional association whose ethical boundaries include the facilitation of torture			1
so , back to business : how far apart should those ceiling shackles be ? what dimensions did you want for that waterboard ? and of course i think it all looks best in black			0
join us on @entity198 / @entity197 .			0
