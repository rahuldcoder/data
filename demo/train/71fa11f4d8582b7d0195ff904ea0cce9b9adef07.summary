@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was supposed to be a routine patrol for @entity5 , a @entity6 serving in northern @entity7			1
but when the @entity10 he was in veered slightly off the road , his life changed in an instant			0
" i remember seeing all the sand across the dash of the @entity10 go up in the air			0
that was pretty much the last thing i remember , " @entity5 recalled eight years later			1
" and there was a big boom , lots of pain			0
" the vehicle hit an anti-tank land mine , flying nearly 50 feet in the air			0
when @entity5 came to , his legs were pinned under the wreckage			1
within days , both were amputated below the knee			0
it was a life - altering injury , but from the beginning , @entity5 had a positive attitude about it			1
" for some reason , i 've always been able to see how lucky i am , " he reflected , noting that his injuries made it possible to wear prosthetic legs			0
" it 's not like losing a fingernail			2
but ... it 's just the way it has to be			2
i 've met people that have been hurt a lot worse than me that have lived full , fulfilling lives			0
so there 's no excuse for me not to			2
" @entity5 spent a year recovering at @entity50 in @entity51 , and he hoped to build a house for his wife and two young sons when he returned home to @entity0 , @entity1			1
but given his new reality -- two prosthetic legs and , at times , a wheelchair -- he was n't sure how he 'd manage it			0
that 's when a member of his church , who 'd heard about @entity5 's situation , took action			1
he persuaded the @entity66 -- of which he was a member -- to help @entity5 build a wheelchair - accessible home with wide doorways and roll - in bathrooms			1
the land was donated by @entity5 's father , and volunteers pitched in to help while @entity5 supervised			1
" the whole community helping me , and working alongside me , it was such a good feeling , " said @entity5 , now 34			1
throughout the construction , @entity5 consulted his friend @entity77 , a building contractor with whom he 'd served in the @entity80 and was driving the @entity10 when it hit the land mine			1
@entity77 suffered a traumatic brain injury in the blast and was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder			0
while his wounds were less visible than @entity5 's , he also struggled to adjust to post-war life			1
when the house was finished , @entity5 and @entity77 decided to " pay it forward " to help other disabled veterans			1
in 2008 , they pooled their military disability payments and started @entity92 , a nonprofit that so far has modified or helped provide homes for 30 disabled veterans in several @entity96 states			1
" there 's thousands of veterans right here in our midst , " @entity5 said			1
" people do n't realize the need that 's out there			2
" in the past decade , a number of nonprofits have sprung up to help @entity7 and @entity108 veterans with their housing issues			1
but according to the @entity111 , those two wars account for only a small percent -- less than 15 % -- of the entire veteran population			0
@entity5 's and @entity77 's organization will help any disabled service member who was wounded during his or her military service , even if it was decades ago			1
" the @entity118 vets have a lot of issues , and we know there are people who got hurt in @entity124 , @entity125 ... @entity126 , " @entity5 said			1
" we just wanted to level the playing field			0
" @entity128 , who lives near @entity5 in @entity129 , @entity1 , served three tours with the @entity131 in @entity126 and ultimately lost a leg because of complications from exposure to @entity135			1
when @entity5 and @entity77 heard that he often had to crawl into his bathroom because his wheelchair would n't fit through his home 's narrow doorways , they decided to help			1
" i 'd have been happy if they could 've figured a way just to widen the door , " @entity128 said			0
" to have them build a complete new addition and a whole new bathroom was unbelievable			0
" @entity92 , using donated labor and materials , will help any disabled veteran who is a homeowner , and all repairs are free			2
@entity5 and @entity151 know that projects such as adding ramps or renovating bathrooms can make a big difference for veterans and their caregivers			1
" we want to make those changes that make their life easier , safer , just better , " @entity5 said			1
@entity5 and @entity77 also want to help those who ca n't afford to buy their own home , many from the younger generation			1
while the organization has built a couple of houses from the ground up , it has also developed a program that moves veterans into foreclosed properties donated by banks and municipalities			2
the group matches a disabled veteran with each property and then partners with a community organization that can gather volunteers to renovate it			2
this local support is an essential part of @entity92			0
@entity5 and @entity151 believe that working with community members makes a big difference to veterans , who can often feel isolated and socially withdrawn			1
" when you have people saying thank you ( by coming ) to your home to swing a hammer and paint a wall , it says something different than shaking your hand and buying you a drink , " said @entity77 , 34			2
" and that support continues once the project is done			0
" @entity198 is an @entity7 war veteran who suffers from @entity199 , among other things			0
his future home in @entity202 , @entity203 , is still in the process of being renovated , but he 's already feeling the benefits of the project			1
" every time i turn around , it 's a new person saying hello , " @entity198 said			2
" this is the first time since i got home that i actually felt the ' thank you , ' the ' wish you well			2
' " when the renovation work is finished on these donated homes , the house is appraised and @entity92 will help the veteran get a mortgage for 50 % or less of its value			0
@entity5 and @entity77 discovered that many veterans struggle with poor credit , so by making affordable payments on a mortgage , they are able to improve their credit score and build equity			1
@entity5 believes it 's a solution that helps veterans as well as their communities			1
" we are putting value back into the properties by not making them free , and we are putting value into the veteran , " @entity5 said			1
" this is a hand up , not a handout			0
" with donations and grants , @entity92 has grown rapidly since it was founded four years ago			0
the nonprofit has received more than 700 applications , and it gets about four or five new ones a week			2
more than 100 projects have already been approved and are in the pipeline			0
@entity5 and @entity77 say their new mission is more than just providing veterans with accessible homes ; it 's about encouraging communities to get involved with those who served their country			1
" my great - grandfather was in @entity252 , grandfather was in @entity253 , my dad was in @entity126			0
i 've seen the uniforms hanging in the closets , " @entity5 said			1
" other people have no connection			0
... ( we want ) to just open people 's eyes			2
" @entity261 is a @entity126 veteran from @entity262 , @entity1 , who suffered knee and back injuries in an accident aboard an aircraft carrier			0
for decades , he endured dozens of operations and gradually became more reclusive -- in part because he was afraid of falling down his front steps , which did n't have a handrail			0
" for 35 years , no one cared , " @entity261 said			0
but when @entity92 built a wheelchair ramp in front of his home , it changed his life			2
the physical improvements made it easier for him to move about safely , and the goodwill gesture deeply touched @entity261			0
" ( they ) made me realize that i had value and worth and that i meant something , " he said			0
now @entity261 socializes frequently with his neighbors and other veterans			2
he says it 's all because of @entity92			0
" they jump - started me back into life ... ( and ) said welcome home , " @entity261 said , tearfully			0
" it 's great to be home after 40 years			1
" for @entity5 and @entity151 , their work is about giving all veterans the same level of respect			1
" regardless of when you served , where you served ... we 're all the same , " @entity5 said			2
" they just need to know that somebody does care about them			0
" we would n't leave someone behind on the battlefield			0
why would we do it at home ? " want to get involved ? check out the @entity92 website at @entity310 and see how to help .			0

@entity5 's nonprofit helps disabled veterans who have various housing issues
sometimes it finds them a new home ; sometimes it modifies an existing home
it 's a way for communities to come together and thank veterans for their sacrifice
