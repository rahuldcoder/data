-- a series of explosions and shootings killed 44 people and injured more than 200 in @entity7 and elsewhere thursday morning , @entity2 police said			1
police believe the wave of attacks , most of them within a two - hour time frame , were a coordinated effort by militants			1
while most of the @entity7 attacks targeted majority @entity17 neighborhoods , explosions also took place in the majority @entity21 provinces of @entity23 , @entity24 , and @entity25			1
no militant group claimed responsibility for the attacks , but authorities believe they may be attempts to unnerve @entity2 and erode their confidence in the ability of @entity2 's army and police , a police official said			1
the country has seen more coordinated attacks since @entity39 troops withdrew from @entity2 at the end of 2011 , the official said			1
an @entity2 government spokesman declined comment on the incidents			2
but the @entity39 @entity45 in @entity7 said it " strongly condemns " what it called terrorist attacks			1
" these heinous acts targeted people going to work and shopping , children going to school and security forces working to protect the citizenry , " the embassy said , adding the attacks were " targeted at all the people of @entity2 in a desperate effort to undermine @entity2 society and its institutions			1
" the @entity62 ' @entity61 in @entity2 also condemned the violence " in the strongest possible terms			1
" " the continuing violent attacks on @entity2 are totally unacceptable and have to stop , " said @entity65 , special representative of the @entity62 secretary - general , in a statement			1
the attacks " are meant to hinder the achievement of national unity and stability , " he said			0
in @entity7 , incidents included gunmen opening fire at a police patrol checkpoint , a car bombing in a busy square and an attack at an outdoor market , according to police officials			2
roadside and car bombings were also reported in towns including @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , police said			0
in the town of @entity25 , two suspected suicide attackers were shot dead by @entity2 security forces as they were attempting to carry out an attack , police officials said			2
the death toll in @entity2 has fluctuated over the past four months as @entity39 troops completed their withdrawal			1
in november 185 @entity2 were killed , the majority of them civilians , according to sources within @entity2 's @entity100			2
in december , that number dropped to 155			0
@entity2 government figures for january showed 151 deaths in violence			2
however , sources with the @entity100 disputed that , saying 293 people were killed			0
and the @entity108 - based @entity107 group , which tracks civilian deaths , put january 's deaths at more than 400			0
" the situation is worsening , " said @entity111 , co-founder and principal analyst of the organization			0
january 's figure " shows a constant level of violence that does n't seem to let up			0
" while the 2011 death toll -- more than 4,000 , according to @entity107 -- was drastically lower than that recorded at the height of the violence , between 2005 and 2007 , the group predicted in a january 2011 report that a low level of conflict in @entity2 would continue to claim a number of civilian lives for years to come			2
@entity2 's @entity21 , @entity17 and @entity129 leaders have squared off in recent months after an arrest warrant was issued for @entity131 , the country 's @entity21 vice president			0
@entity133 is accused of organizing his security detail into a death squad that targeted government and military officials			0
the warrant was issued shortly after the vice president 's @entity21 - backed @entity140 party said it would boycott @entity142 , saying prime minister @entity143 was cutting it out of the decision - making process			0
@entity133 last week denied the charges in a televised speech , saying the @entity2 judicial council is under the control and influence of the central government and that the charges are " politically motivated			0
" @entity2 officials expressed concern thursday that the violence could cast a shadow over @entity2 's hosting the next @entity157 summit on march 29			1
the government said earlier this month that logistical and security arrangements had been agreed upon for the event			0
the @entity39 @entity45 said , " we are confident the @entity2 people will remain firm in their desire to keep sectarian division at bay and not allow the terrorists to win or their corrupt vision to triumph over the democratic will of the people			1
