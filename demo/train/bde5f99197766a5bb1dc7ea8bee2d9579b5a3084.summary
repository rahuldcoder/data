@entity5 , suspected of leaking classified information to the @entity8 website , is being moved to the @entity9 at @entity10 , @entity11 , defense officials said tuesday			1
" at this juncture of the case , given the likely continued period of pre-trial confinement , we have determined that the new pre-trial facility at @entity10 is the most appropriate one for @entity5 going forward , " @entity13 general counsel @entity12 told reporters			2
a defense official initially told @entity20 was moving to the @entity21 at @entity10 , but later corrected that information			0
@entity5 , 23 , a military intelligence analyst from @entity23 , was being held in the brig at @entity25 south of @entity0			2
there had been a push by friends and supporters to have his confinement conditions eased			0
supporters said he was confined in a one - man cell with only one hour a day outside of the cell for exercise			0
defense officials said at a briefing that an evaluation aimed at determining whether @entity5 is competent has been completed , and there was no need for him to remain in the @entity0 area			1
among those arrested at a demonstration protesting @entity5 's conditions last month were @entity48 , who leaked the @entity49 in 1971 to the @entity50 and retired @entity52 col. @entity51 who resigned to protest the @entity3 invasion of @entity54			1
@entity12 told reporters that the decision to move @entity5 is not meant as a criticism of the @entity25 facility and congratulated the military personnel there for the job they did " in difficult circumstances			1
" " we remain satisfied that @entity5 's pre-trial confinement at @entity25 was in compliance with legal and regulatory standards in all respects , " he said			1
@entity5 's case -- and the details of his detention -- drew attention last month in the aftermath of comments by former @entity75 spokesman @entity74 and @entity74 's sudden resignation			1
amidst reports that @entity5 had been forced to sleep without clothing and was confined to his cell 23 hours a day , @entity74 had criticized how @entity5 was held at @entity25 , calling it " ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid , " according to news reports			2
he later stepped down from his post			0
the @entity13 has maintained that @entity5 is held in accordance with rules governing all maximum - custody detainees at @entity25 , for his protection and the safety of others , and that @entity5 is on " @entity90 " status , for " prevention of injury			1
" rep. @entity93 , @entity94 , released a statement tuesday after news of @entity5 's pending transfer broke , promising to demand written assurances from @entity13 officials that @entity5 's rights will be protected			1
" any move of @entity2			0
@entity5 does not change the underlying fact , which has not been disputed by the @entity13 , that he has been held under conditions which may in fact constitute ' cruel and unusual punishment ' in violation of the 8th amendment , " he wrote			2
@entity3 military officials have told @entity1 that @entity5 is the prime suspect in the leak of hundreds of thousands of classified documents that ended up on the @entity8 website			2
he is awaiting a decision on whether he will face a court martial			0
last month , the @entity52 notified @entity5 that he faces 22 more charges in connection with the alleged downloading of secret information from computers in @entity54 , bringing to 34 the total charges in the case			0
the most serious new charge alleges he aided the enemy by making the information public ; that charge is punishable by death			0
a statement from the @entity52 said the prosecution team " has notified the defense that the prosecution will not recommend the death penalty , " but technically it is up to the commander overseeing the case to make the final decision .			0
