-- each morning of his federal kidnapping trial , @entity1 sings			1
in the last few days , he has chosen a holiday theme , with " @entity4 " or " @entity5 ' rising from the defense table as @entity1 closes his eyes and rocks slightly -- lost , it appears , in hymns and psalms			1
the 12 people weighing his fate have witnessed the spectacle from the jury box			0
they will soon have to determine whether the man accused of snatching 14 - year - old @entity17 from her bed at knifepoint and holding her captive for nine months is legally insane , as his lawyers claim , or a calculating kidnapper			0
@entity1 's attorneys are mounting an insanity defense , which requires them to prove he was so mentally ill when he snatched @entity25 that he did not understand the wrongfulness of his actions			1
@entity29 district judge @entity28 has adjourned the trial until after the @entity32 holiday , when @entity1 's defense team will continue its case , and present expert testimony in support of the insanity claim			1
@entity1 's attorneys have called witnesses to describe his increasingly isolated and odd behavior			1
but many have also described the 57 - year - old as intelligent and resourceful ; someone with a salesman 's knack for persuasion			1
through tears friday , @entity1 's legal wife said again and again that she 'd been manipulated by him			1
@entity48 was called to the stand as a defense witness , but it was her cross examination by the prosecution that dramatically punctuated the week of proceedings			2
she is currently medicated and undergoing therapy for her own mental illness			0
@entity48 , who is serving a 15 - year sentence for her role in @entity25 's abduction , said she was present while @entity1 kept @entity25 tethered to a metal cable at a mountain camp above @entity62			1
@entity48 said @entity1 played on her strong religious convictions , using " revelations " and " priesthood blessings " to sway and appease her			1
when she complained about his heavy drinking , @entity1 said he 'd had a divine revelation that condoned it , she testified			1
her heart broke at the thought of sharing him with other wives			0
he placed his hand on her head and delivered a blessing , telling her weakness would result in eternal consequence , she claimed			0
he smoked and read @entity77 , ' because in order to rise above all things , he told her they had to sink below them			0
" he 's a good liar , is n't he ? " assistant u.s. attorney @entity82 asked			2
@entity48 agreed : " he 's a great deceiver			2
" the battle over @entity1 's mental state has played out in state and federal courts over the years			1
in february 2005 , after failed plea negotiations with @entity90 prosecutors , @entity1 began his courtroom singing , according to court documents			1
later that year , a state court found him incompetent to stand trial			0
his doctors diagnosed him with " narcissistic personality disorder , " and said his illness fell " within the psychotic spectrum			0
" in 2008 , a federal grand jury indicted @entity1 and @entity48 on charges of kidnapping and transportation of a minor across state lines for sexual purposes			1
the following year , @entity17 herself took the witness stand at a hearing in federal court to determine @entity1 's competency			1
@entity29 district court judge @entity28 issued a 149 - page written order , finding @entity1 well enough to stand trial			1
@entity28 carefully cited testimony from @entity1 's caretakers at @entity116 's forensic unit , where @entity1 was confined after his arrest			1
a nursing director testified that @entity1 's unwillingness to work towards restoring his mental competency " was a huge red flag that he was faking , " and that " there was a distinct correlation between @entity1 's singing and his court appearances			1
" during his three - year stay at the hospital , @entity1 read dozens of books , yet he never asked for a religious text , " noted @entity28			2
" he especially enjoyed the show charmed , " pulling his chair close to the screen whenever the women at the center of the witchcraft drama were scantily clad , the caretakers said			0
@entity28 adopted a skeptical view of @entity1 's convictions , writing that " the record is replete with examples showing that @entity1 's religious beliefs are not fixed but , rather , used strategically			1
" for instance , @entity1 's claim to be a prophet , the @entity143 , or the @entity144 , manifests only when it serves his own self - interested purpose			1
when he encountered law enforcement officer or people from whom he could obtain money , food or shelter , he made no such grandiose claims , " wrote @entity28			0
" @entity1 has accurately read and exploited the vulnerability in the system , which protects mentally incompetent persons from standing trial ... stalling the process of his legal case for nearly seven years , " the judge concluded			1
the ruling cleared the way for @entity1 's trial to begin about two weeks ago in @entity62 's federal courthouse			1
on the second day of the defense case this week , @entity1 's elderly father made his way to the witness stand with the help of a walker to describe his son 's character traits			1
" @entity1 's a very intelligent person and used that to its full extent in the harassment of the other children and my wife , " he said			1
the father described him as a sexually curious boy who " got in trouble playing doctor " with other children around the age of 8 or 9			0
to educate his son , the father showed him an old medical book with detailed pictures of genitalia			0
but the plan backfired , the father said , and @entity1 promptly got into trouble again for playing doctor " with the rest of the neighborhood			2
" " it was ill - advised because it was too explicit , really			2
i should have known better , but i was n't always very careful , " the elder @entity1 testified			2
court documents reveal signs of sexual deviance that continued into @entity1 's teens			1
he was arrested for exposing himself to a 4 - year - old girl in the neighborhood			0
the probation officer assigned to his case called @entity1 's behavior " bordering on psychotic , " and referred him to a psychologist who diagnosed " @entity206			1
" another counselor at the time described @entity1 as an " excellent manipulator			2
" @entity210 , the defendant 's younger brother , said he watched as a troubled @entity1 grappled to turn his life around and embrace the @entity213 before beginning a steady mental slide , alienating his family and church leaders			1
" i said , ' i think you 're going off on the wrong way , i think you 're drifting away form the church			0
i think maybe you 've been deceived by a false spirit , ' " @entity210 testified			0
his brother suddenly asked to be called " @entity222 , " but he refused			0
" i just kept calling him @entity1			2
" their relationship ended after that			0
" i started feeling that this is really starting to look like a mental illness and i sent a letter encouraging him to get some help , " testified @entity210 , a mental health counselor			0
@entity1 met his wife , @entity48 , at a church - sponsored counseling session in 1985 , the woman testified thursday			2
as she shared her story of an abusive marriage , @entity1 took her hand to comfort her			2
" and we 've held hands ever since , " she testified			0
but eventually , he began to seek out other " celestial wives , " she said			0
in a low , rambling voice that sometimes failed her , @entity48 described collapsing crying in her husband 's arms when he told her of a revelation to take more wives			0
when attempts to find a willing bride failed , @entity1 declared they were to use force , she said			2
" i was told that we were commanded to take 14 - year - old young women and we were to snatch them out of the world and train them up in the ministries of @entity253			0
" she had concerns about this , she said			0
" i knew that the @entity256 had all power to provide the young women if that was his will , and i know of the pain and suffering that i had been through being separated from my children and i did n't want the young women to be taken away from their family and their friends			0
" nevertheless , she strived to be obedient			0
@entity1 began to " stalk out " young girls while panhandling in town , @entity48 testified , and on the morning of june 5 , 2002 , he arrived at their camp with @entity17 in tow			2
@entity25 has described him as preoccupied more with the sexual than the spiritual , raping her multiple times per day , and demonstrating with @entity48 the finer points of certain sex acts			0
if the defense evidence regarding @entity1 's state of mind meets the burden of " clear and convincing " in the jury 's estimation , he could walk the streets of @entity62 again somedayt			1
if not , he will face a sentence of life behind bars			0
the defendant himself may not be present to face jurors as they deliver his verdict ; he watches the proceedings on a security camera monitor each day , expelled from the courtroom for his steadfast refusal to stop singing .			0
