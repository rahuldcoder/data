-- of course the tv series @entity2 seems dated now , but it 's not just because @entity5 's white @entity4 suits and slip - on shoes belong to a mercifully bygone era			0
the fact is , @entity9 is no longer the same city as the one portrayed in the 1980s cop show			2
the expansive sandy beaches are still there , as is the surfeit of sunshine , the hint of the exotic and the hordes of sun - hungry tourists who have flocked to this holiday hotspot for the last 80 years			0
but @entity9 has shed much of its unwanted baggage from the 80s and has grown beyond a resort town into something more substantial			1
still barely 100 years old , @entity9 was a tourist destination almost from its inception			0
the offshore sandbar called @entity31 was quickly recognized as having all the ingredients of a world - class holiday resort and the hotel - building spree that took place in the 1920s and 30s has left @entity31 with hundreds of stunning @entity38 structures that give the area its distinctive look by the 1980s , as well as being the destination of choice for holiday makers , retirees and ' snowbirds ' ( @entity47 and northern @entity48 wintering in @entity49 ) , @entity9 had attracted an uninvited guest -- the ' cocaine cowboy			1
' @entity9 's proximity to @entity53 made it a key point of entry for @entity57 cocaine smugglers and the city became a battleground for ruthless drug barons intent on grabbing their piece of the @entity63			2
the mid 80s was the @entity2 era , when the city 's reputation for glamour and hedonism came with a side order of carjackings and gangland shootouts			2
but by the mid 90s , @entity9 had largely driven the cocaine cowboys out of town and hoteliers like @entity77 began converting some of those @entity38 classics into sophisticated boutique hotels fit for the international jet set			1
the guns may have gone but the glitz was never far away			0
now that @entity9 's been to rehab and come out cleaned up and healthy , it turns out there 's more to the city than glitzy nightclubs and the surgically enhanced bodies of the beautiful people			2
@entity9 has acquired a reputation as the new kid on the block in the modern art scene , a reputation that was cemented when the world 's most prestigious modern art fair , @entity97 , arrived in the city in 2002			1
just like the snowbirds , @entity97 returns to @entity9 each winter and the @entity100 neighborhood has now become a bona fide art district , with exclusive galleries showcasing cutting - edge art all year round			1
nearby , the @entity105 is full of studios and workshops producing contemporary furniture and art. then there 's the fact that @entity9 is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world , with some 60 % of the population born outside the @entity48 the food , music , culture and language of @entity118 have all become part of modern @entity9 , giving the city a cultural heritage that belies its youth			1
but do n't think @entity9 's reinvention as a cultural destination has done anything to dent it 's appetite for the good times			0
when it comes to partying , there 's not many places that can keep up with @entity9 , and even fewer that can do it with as much style			0
in truth , there 's still a touch of the old vice about @entity9 , and who knows , with the 80s revival , we may not have seen the last of those white suits .			0

@entity9 has shed its 80s reputation for carjackings and ' cocaine cowboys '
@entity100 and the @entity105 are up - and - coming arts neighborhoods
the language and culture of @entity118 are part of modern @entity9
@entity9 still attracts the international jet set and is a party city like no other
