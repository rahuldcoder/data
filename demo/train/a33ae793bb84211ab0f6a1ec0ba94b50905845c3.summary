@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 on monday allowed a controversial state dna testing law to remain in effect until the justices have time to consider the broader constitutional questions			0
@entity9 's @entity8 permits police to collect genetic material from those who have been arrested , but not yet convicted			1
chief justice @entity13 issued the three - page in - chambers opinion , putting a state court 's ruling favoring a criminal defendant on hold			1
" collecting dna from individuals arrested for violent felonies provides a valuable tool for investigating unsolved crimes and thereby helping to remove violent offenders from the general population , " @entity13 wrote			1
" crimes for which dna evidence is implicated tend to be serious , and serious crimes cause serious injuries			0
that @entity9 may not employ a duly enacted statute to help prevent these injuries constitutes irreparable harm			2
" the chief justice said there is a " fair prospect " the @entity2 would ultimately find in favor of the state on the search and seizure questions			1
after more legal briefs are filed , the high court in coming weeks will decide whether to hear the case and issue a definitive , binding ruling			1
oral arguments would likely not be held until early next year			0
a 1994 federal law created a national database in which local , state , and federal law enforcement agencies can compare and share information on dna matches from convicted felons , but courts have been at odds on just when such samples can be collected and the information distributed			0
the current case involves a @entity9 man convicted of a 2003 rape in @entity59 in the state 's eastern shore region			2
@entity62 had been arrested three years ago on an unrelated assault charge , and a biological sample was automatically obtained at that time			0
@entity62 moved to suppress the use of the @entity19 on @entity67 grounds , but was ultimately convicted of the first - degree rape offense			0
a divided @entity69 later agreed with @entity62 , saying suspects under arrest enjoy a higher level of privacy than a convicted felon , outweighing the state 's law enforcement interests			1
that court also said obtaining @entity62 's dna immediately after arrest was not necessary in identifying him , and that the process was more personally invasive than standard fingerprinting			2
state officials then asked the justices to intervene now , saying the state court ruling " has resulted in the loss of a valuable crime - fighting tool relied upon by @entity9			1
" they said that from a law enforcement and forensic perspective , there is no difference between fingerprinting and collecting " biometric information			0
" @entity13 in his opinion tentatively agreed			0
" the ( state court ) decision below has direct effects beyond @entity9 : because the dna samples @entity9 collects may otherwise be eligible for the @entity99 's national dna database , the decision renders the database less effective for other states and the federal government , " @entity13 wrote			1
the state dna collection law in @entity9 is set to expire at the end of next year , but the justices are likely to decide its constitutionality before then			2
the case is @entity9 v. @entity62 ( @entity108 ) .			0

@entity9 's law allows police to collect genetic material from those arrested
a lower - court ruling favoring a criminal defendant is put on hold
chief justice @entity13 says there is a " fair prospect " the high court will *uphold* the law
