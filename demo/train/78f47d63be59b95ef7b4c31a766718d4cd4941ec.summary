-- since everything about " @entity2 " is fortissimo — including but not limited to its unabashed pursuit of awards that are shiny or globular or both — you have perhaps already heard a little about the movie now storming the @entity9 of your wallet			0
you may already know that to make his movie adaptation of the internationally popular theatrical musical conjured from the 19th - century political novel by @entity18 , director @entity19 ( " @entity20 " ) bade his actors sing live during filming			1
you probably already know that @entity25 , as the wretched single mother - turned - prostitute @entity23 , is reputedly a formidable @entity27 favorite for her sobbing and warbling and haircutting - in - real - time			1
you 've learned , from posters and trailers , that @entity34 , as former convict @entity32 , looks impressively stricken and that @entity36 , as implacable police inspector @entity35 , looks disconcertingly dyspeptic			0
what 's left to learn is this : " @entity2 " provides compelling reasons for @entity36 to be peeved , beginning with the humiliation of having to sing @entity41 - style , when it clearly is so not his thing , and ending with the @entity46 wardrobe into which the gentleman is packed			2
( o , for @entity36 's costumed glory days in " @entity49 ! " ) @entity34 has a right to be cranky too , although he 's too much of a trouper to show it as he overemotes on demand and sings of finding @entity55 after he steals a pair of candlesticks from a nice priest			2
) @entity25 looks happy enough channeling @entity61 for her tremulous rendition of the @entity64 - appropriated anthem '' @entity65 , '' but that 's no doubt because she knows that soon after the song , she 's pretty much done for the night			1
@entity68 ' ' @entity70 ' trailer posted shall i go on about all the ways in which this fake - opulent " @entity2 " made me long for guillotines while millions of viewers who have softer , more generous hearts than i may swoon with money 's - worth contentment ? ( at least it does n't skimp on length : the movie is approximately as long as the 1832 @entity82 uprising it depicts			2
) @entity84 and @entity85 mug and prance as the comic - relief grifters thénardier and his missus , outfitted in what has become de rigueur for both @entity89 — @entity91 makeup and prosthetically grungy teeth			1
@entity93 and @entity94 play the young lovers @entity104 ( @entity23 's muppet daughter , raised by @entity32 ) and the boy - band - styled student revolutionary @entity98 like lab rats , their pale faces and lashless eyelids often observed in the merciless close - up that is one of @entity19 's mix - it - up signature shots			1
( he is similarly devoted to tilted perspective and the room - at - a - 45 - degree - angle shot			0
) ' @entity107 ' at no. 1 for second week : $ 36.7m it 's a daunting challenge , to be sure , to turn a big musical into a viable movie			0
for every great " cabaret , " " @entity112 , " and " @entity114 , " there 's a dud " rent , " " @entity116 , " and " @entity117 ! " but this steam - driven military weapon of an enterprise is a sobering reminder of just how tinny a musical " @entity2 " was in the first place — the listless music and lyrics by @entity124 , @entity125 , and @entity126 , the derivative characters fashioned from " @entity128 ! " scraps			0
and even if you do come to mr. @entity19 's neighborhood loving the show , having seen seven stage productions and named your cat @entity135 after the urchin who hitches his fate to those of grown - up revolutionaries , well , you 're in for a gobsmacking : this '' prestige '' production is at heart a minor road - show carnival , leaving behind little but tinsel as it rumbles through the streets of @entity149			1
