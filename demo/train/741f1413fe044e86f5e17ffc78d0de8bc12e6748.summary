a newly published @entity1 regulation said until friday that a service member could be referred to as a " @entity3 " when describing " black or @entity5 " personnel			1
the @entity1 confirmed wednesday the language was contained in the october 22 " @entity7 , " known as regulation ar 600 - 20			2
the regulation is periodically updated but the @entity1 could not say how recently the word was added to the document			1
in a lengthy section of the document describing " race and ethnic code definitions , " the regulation stated under the category " @entity5 " that would include , " a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of @entity21			1
terms such as " @entity24 " or " @entity3 " can be used in addition to " black " or " @entity5			1
" the @entity1 changed the regulation friday and issued an apology " to anyone we offended			2
" the new policy states that " black or african - american " are the only acceptable terms			0
the @entity1 , along with the rest of the military , collects extensive demographic data on the makeup of the military force for issues such as equal opportunity and ensuring discrimination does not take place			0
one @entity1 official familiar with the document said it 's possible the word was added so when forms are filled out , a black or @entity5 - @entity5 person could " self report " and choose to identify themselves as a @entity3			1
but a military officer specializing in personnel issues for the @entity50 called that " the dumbest thing i have ever heard , " noting the @entity50 does not use the word in any of its extensive collection of demographic data			0
lt. col. s. @entity54 , an @entity1 spokesman , said the use of the word comes from an outdated section			0
" the racial definitions in @entity59 para. 6 - 2 are outdated , currently under review , and will be updated shortly , " he said on wednesday			0
" the @entity1 takes pride in sustaining a culture where all personnel are treated with dignity and respect and not discriminated against based on race , color , religion , gender and national origin			0
