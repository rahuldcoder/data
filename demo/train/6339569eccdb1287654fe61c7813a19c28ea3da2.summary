-- this past sunday 's " @entity5 " and the latest issue of @entity7 bring back to the fore the complicated issue of money and politics			1
both highlight a new book by @entity10 , " @entity11 , " which rails against what @entity10 calls " honest graft			1
" @entity10 charges that leaders from both houses of @entity16 have been drawing on insider knowledge to make money in the stock market -- a practice that is banned in @entity22 industry and restricted in other sectors of government			1
and although he is a conservative at the @entity26 , @entity10 is an equal opportunity scourge , attacking both @entity29 and @entity30 leaders			1
@entity29 leader @entity31 and @entity30 speaker @entity32 have fired back , asserting that @entity10 has misrepresented them and they have done nothing wrong			1
until competent legal authorities investigate , both deserve the benefit of the doubt			1
the public does , of course , deserve a more thorough airing of the facts			2
equally important , @entity16 ought to have rules about conflicts of interest that are as demanding as those for people who work in the executive and judicial branches ; so far , @entity16 skates free			1
but whatever the rebuttals from @entity54 , this controversy underscores a deepening sense that money plays far too large a role in politics			1
if anything unites the tea party and the @entity63 protesters , surely it is the sense that the system is rigged in favor of big shots in @entity67 and against little guys back home			2
money is at the heart of it			1
a new book that should receive far more attention makes an even more sweeping and thoroughly researched case against money in politics -- " @entity78 : how @entity16 -- and a @entity79 to stop it , " by @entity82 law professor @entity81			1
the author is a man of many parts : @entity81 made his name as a legal theorist in issues surrounding new technologies , but he also has a keen interest in politics			1
he was the youngest member of the @entity92 delegation that nominated @entity94 at the @entity30 convention in 1980 , clerked for conservative @entity97 justice @entity96 , and later endorsed his friend and former @entity100 colleague @entity99 for president			2
@entity81 , who lately has been working to organize a movement for a new constitutional convention , is disillusioned with both right and left and blasts away at them for essentially selling the republic out			0
but his charge is not that politicians in @entity67 are taking money on the side , Ã  la @entity110			2
he doubts much of that goes on today			0
rather , he is deeply troubled by what he calls " dependence corruption " -- the degree to which politicians have become dependent on money from lobbyists in order to pay for their campaigns , and the ways in which that dependence has increasingly distorted public policy in ways that do serious harm to the country , while also ( and just as perniciously ) undermining public trust			1
his argument is wide - ranging and impossible to do justice to in a brief column			0
but a few of the most striking facts he marshals are worth recognizing			0
among them : -- the cost of getting elected to @entity16 has exploded : from 1974 to 2008 , @entity81 notes , the average cost of a re-election campaign ballooned from $ 56,000 to more than $ 1.3 million , a more than twentyfold increase that far outpaces inflation			1
-- fundraising is a constant concern : candidates have to spend between 30 % and 70 % of their time raising money			1
( lobbyists , however can ease this pressure through many kinds of what @entity81 calls " legislative subsidies " -- advice , research , support , and most of all , campaign cash			2
) -- the revolving door between @entity16 and lobbyists is spinning faster : in the 1970s , just 3 % of retiring members of @entity16 went into lobbying			1
but by 2004 , in the previous seven years more than half of all senators and 42 percent of @entity159 members had made the switch			0
-- the incentives for lobbying are clear			0
a 2009 paper found , for example , that firms get between $ 6 and $ 20 back for every $ 1 they invest in lobbying for tax benefits			0
with regard to taxes and regulation , @entity81 's observations are particularly sharp			0
business leaders argue , for example , that they are not investing as much as they might in new jobs because they face so much uncertainty that they do n't know what to expect from the government from one year to the next			2
many citizens are likewise baffled by some regulations and , especially , the tax code : why is it so massive , so confusing , sometimes so seemingly wasteful and preferential ? @entity81 's explanation is that this complexity and uncertainty is no accident , and that 's because politicians in @entity67 have an interest in keeping business guessing and the rest of us confused			0
pass a tax law for five years and lobbyists wo n't need to come around with contributions for a long time ; make it a one - year law and they 'll be back next week			2
likewise , keep the code incomprehensible , and the voters wo n't know if they 're getting hosed			0
one of @entity81 's heroes is @entity202 , and he likes to quote the @entity22 philosopher as saying , " there are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root			0
" @entity81 sees the role of money in politics as the root of the country 's current ills , from health care to education to the economy			1
he also thinks it explains why the parties appear to have grown closer in economic ideology -- where the concentrated corporate lobbying money is -- while growing more polarized in social ideology , for which more extreme viewpoints yield a bigger haul			2
he is quick to note that this corruption is " not the product of evil " -- it leads to " great harm , " but is the result of " no @entity230			0
" without " great evil , " @entity81 reflects , he is " not yet sure that we can muster the will to fight			0
" that 's a deep concern , and it calls to mind the memorable formulation of the economist @entity239 , who once divided our problems into two categories : a wolf at the door , or termites in the basement			0
as a nation , we 've always been a lot better at handling the first than the second			0
but if @entity81 is right about the campaign finance system , it 's a major case of termites in the basement -- and addressing it will require more than simply throwing all the bums out			0
in @entity81 's view , it may require laying a whole new section of our foundation instead			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			2
