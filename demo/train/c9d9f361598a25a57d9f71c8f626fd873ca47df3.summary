she 's one of the most powerful women in football after cracking one of sports ' most notorious glass ceilings , but even @entity8 is not immune from the demands of domestic drudgery			1
" sorry for all of the noise , " she says as the clatter of workmen and screaming kids crackles down the phone line			0
" the people who were supposed to be here 30 minutes ago to fix our carpets have just shown up ! " a proud mother of seven - year - old twin girls and a baby boy , @entity8 was for the best part of two decades @entity24 's foremost footballer			1
though the @entity26 winner and double @entity28 gold medalist -- described as " the biggest @entity24 - born soccer star of all time " -- is swift to laugh off such lofty titles			1
" i 'm just a former player that every day has to wake up , get her kids to school and figure out what i 'm making them for lunch and dinner , " the 42 - year - old @entity8 , who played for the @entity24 women 's team on over 200 occasions between 1987 and 2004 , told @entity1			1
however , it 's not just the school run and her kids ' packed lunches that @entity8 has on her mind these days			1
appointed to the board of directors at major @entity49 club @entity48 , she occupies a position within the sport that few other women can match			1
as well as her role in the " @entity56 , " the @entity54 native is a minority owner of the newly - formed @entity59 @entity58 ( @entity60 ) -- which will join @entity61 ( @entity61 ) in 2017			1
" i never stand up there and say ' i 'm doing this to get more women in football , ' " says @entity8 of her appointment at @entity48 , which is owned by @entity49 @entity24 investor @entity63			1
" but i take pride in the fact and i look at it as a great responsibility to make sure i do the best job i can			0
" i personally did n't say yes just to tick a box			0
i think they will soon learn that i have opinions , i have ideas			0
" @entity8 's links to the @entity49 capital go beyond the boardroom			1
her parents lived in the city for over four years when she was younger , with her father -- an @entity84 pilot -- working at the @entity24 embassy in @entity56			2
that was when @entity8 first became aware of the team affectionately known as the " @entity88 " ( the yellow - reds )			1
" it was one of the clubs i could follow on the local tv , " she explains			0
" it was the colors i would see when i would walk around @entity56			0
" so my holidays , @entity96 and a couple of weeks over summer were spent over in @entity56			0
as @entity48 was the team i started following then			1
" @entity63 , who took over @entity48 in 2012 , has grand ambitions for the club that include the construction of a new 52,000 - seater stadium for the three - time @entity49 champions			2
the @entity104 's vision appealed to @entity8 , who hopes to raise the club 's international profile -- especially in the @entity24 she wants to ensure that " when people are talking about their favorite teams , @entity48 is one of the teams that comes out of their mouth " and hopes the club continues its recent trend of touring the @entity24 during the @entity115 offseason			1
" i 'd love to be a part of that and helping get the fan support , " she insists			0
" even though i know there 's an incredible fan support here for @entity48			1
" @entity8 's own relationship with the game dates back to her childhood when , perhaps surprisingly , she had a hard time convincing her coach to let her play			1
that coach also happened to be her dad , and the eager @entity8 was barely out of diapers			2
" i was n't allowed to play organized soccer until i turned five , " says @entity8			2
" i had an older brother and a sister that were a year apart			0
they were on the same team and my dad happened to be coaching them			0
" i just remember standing on the sidelines , collecting balls for them when they went wide of the goal , hoping my dad would say , ' @entity144 , do you want to jump in ? ' " those are some of the early memories , hanging out with older siblings , getting beat up by them and their friends at practice but loving it			0
" i just wanted to belong to a team			0
" eventually her father relented and finally let the precocious ball girl enter the fray			0
@entity8 did n't look back			2
her glittering career saw the prolific goalscorer help grow football in the @entity24 , firstly as the youngest member of the team which won the inaugural @entity161 in 1991			1
olympic glory followed as @entity8 added a gold medal to her resume in front of fervent home support at the 1996 @entity167			2
three years later -- once again on home soil -- @entity8 scored in a tense penalty shootout as the @entity24 narrowly beat @entity170 at the @entity172 @entity171 to lift the @entity26 for a second time			1
fast forward to @entity174 and she became a double @entity28 champion , having added a silver medal to her collection of precious metals at the 2000 games in @entity180			2
@entity8 's experiences within such successful teams had a profound effect on her as she grew in confidence , learned how to work with others , while also boosting her self - esteem			2
above all , she learned how to handle failure			0
" we have two daughters of our own who are about seven and a half and i just see the excitement , " she explains , " the lessons that they are learning every single time they go out there			0
" it 's no surprise to me			0
you look across the board , not just with female athletes but with @entity202 companies , and women that are in top executive positions all played some kind of sports growing up			2
they talk about the empowerment they felt			0
" getting kids up and motivated and then all of the wonderful things they experience and learn through sport are so important			0
much more than you would ever get sat in front of your tv			0
" as well as her @entity48 role , @entity8 is part of a band of celebrities who have signed up as minority owners of @entity60 , a new team hoping to act as rivals to @entity224 , which won its fifth championship in 2014			1
@entity227 legend " magic " johnson and @entity8 's husband @entity228 , a former pro baseball player , are both part of a star - spangled ownership team			1
the continued expansion of @entity61 -- which commissioner @entity233 hopes will swell to 24 teams by 2020 -- is proof of soccer 's growing popularity in the @entity24 , with women forming part of the professional ranks			1
formed in 2013 , the @entity241 ( @entity241 ) allows eight teams to vie for domestic glory , a welcome development following multiple false starts for the female game in @entity24 , the most recent setback arriving when @entity248 ceased operations in 2012			2
although the country also boasts the women 's premier soccer league -- which houses both professional and amateur teams -- @entity8 hopes the @entity241 can cement itself on the nation 's sporting landscape			1
" the success of the @entity61 will help the @entity241 , " insists @entity8			2
" the success of the @entity24 national teams will help the @entity241			2
" there are several teams that are tied to @entity61 clubs and that could be the potential for the future where we 're able to share facilities , share infrastructure			0
" so when @entity60 enters the league , will it also boast a women 's team ? " do n't know yet , " says a candid @entity8			1
" for me , it just makes sense , in one of the largest hotbed of girls ' club soccer in the country , if not the world			0
" being a part of the ownership group , we have a lot of work ahead of us			0
the women 's team is n't their first priority , but i want it to be in the conversation			1
" i 'm going to make sure it 's something that 's discussed consistently because it 's the right thing to do and this area will support it			0
there are so many talented players in this area , up and down the coast			0
" as far as @entity8 is concerned , the future of @entity24 soccer is bright -- regardless of gender			1
" i 'm always hopeful , i love the game too much , " she says			0
" it does n't mean i 'm naive , but i want the game to succeed in this country and the women 's side is a huge part of that			1
