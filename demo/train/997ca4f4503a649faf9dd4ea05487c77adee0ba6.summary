you 've won the " @entity3			1
now , what are you going to do with it ? a lot is riding on the answer -- especially viewers			2
@entity10 hosted " tonight , " the jewel of @entity13 's late - night lineup , for 22 years , and though he was regularly criticized for lacking the comedic sting and interviewing skills of rival @entity16 , he topped the ratings for almost his entire run			1
on the other hand , @entity20 , who held the job for just nine months in 2009 - 10 , was quickly removed when his numbers did n't measure up to his sometimes out - there humor			2
now comes another change , with @entity26 taking @entity10 's spot and @entity28 becoming the host of " @entity30			2
" @entity26 is facing a much different landscape than @entity10 did in 1992 , however -- or even the one that @entity20 dealt with in 2009			2
there 's more competition , for one thing			2
@entity26 's late - night rivals include @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ( again ) , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity20 , among others			1
also , for some viewers , not to mention the news media , there 's still the shadow of the @entity50 , the long - time king of " tonight , " @entity50			1
that 's a lot to deal with			2
it 's no wonder @entity26 posed for @entity53 wearing -- literally -- big shoes			2
having watched other late - night masters do their work through videos at @entity60 's @entity59 , he treats the job with respect			1
but now that he 's entered the golden club of talk - show hosts , does it really matter ? " the late - night genre is the only one whose legacy means more to the on - camera talents than it does to the audience , at least on a conscious level , " wrote tv critic @entity67 last year after @entity10 announced his retirement			1
" where the actors in sitcoms , dramas , and daytime talk shows are forever trying to justify , alter , or subvert the old forms , only talk - show hosts take upon themselves the burden of history , vowing to carry on the tradition of @entity50 ( who is most frequently cited ) , even as the demo they seek to reach says , baffled , ' @entity50 ? @entity86 ? ' " the @entity50 legacy indeed , it says a lot about the late - night landscape that there 's now a whole generation who barely remembers who @entity50 was			1
when baby boomers celebrate the 50th anniversary of @entity100 on " the @entity101 , " at least their children and grandchildren have some familiarity with the @entity100 , whose songs have become part of the pop cultural tapestry			0
memories of @entity50 , on the other hand , are disappearing faster than the colors on an old 8 - millimeter home movie			1
it 's no wonder that his estate launched a @entity113 channel in 2011			2
" you talk to someone under the age of 25 , and they 've heard the name and most of them know he was on the ' @entity3 , ' but his star is fading as the people who remember him go , " says @entity114 , the head of the @entity115 for @entity116 and @entity117 at @entity118			1
which is ironic , because it was @entity50 who really established the template for the @entity132			1
though he was n't the first to host " tonight , " it was @entity50 who became the security blanket for @entity136 for three decades , thanks to his skillful monologue , his way with guests , even his corny skits			1
his " tonight " was also hugely popular : according to a 1978 @entity60 profile of @entity50 , in the mid- 1970s it was attracting close to 20 million viewers			1
that 's twice as much as the combined average audience for @entity10 , @entity16 and @entity147 this season -- and about the same as the top - rated prime - time entertainment show of 2012 - 13 , " @entity150			1
" but @entity26 says he has a different model in mind for his " tonight " : the original host , @entity155			2
' what i do is more a variety show ' @entity155 is even less remembered than @entity50 these days , but his " tonight " was a free - wheeling hodgepodge of chat , skits , piano - playing ( @entity155 was a prolific composer who wrote " @entity162 " ) , ad - libbing , man - on - the - street interviews and loopy stunts			1
in one of them , he persuaded the @entity167 to stage an " invasion " of @entity169			0
@entity26 probably wo n't do that -- it 's a different world -- but his show already has some of the qualities that @entity155 employed			1
he 's a capable guitarist and musical mimic who has done dead - on parodies of @entity178 and @entity179 , among others			1
bits with guests such as @entity183 and @entity184 have gotten millions of views online , and segments such as " @entity187 " have some of the whimsical quality that @entity155 was fond of			0
" what i do is more a variety show			0
it 's always been older in style			0
i 'm an old soul , " he told @entity195			0
" i would love for @entity155 to still be around , because i think he would say , ' this guy gets it			0
' " youthful energy moreover , by late - night standards , @entity26 is n't " old , " which is another quality he has going for him			1
@entity204 ' @entity16 , inspiration for so many of the current hosts , is now old @entity16 -- he 'll be 67 in april			0
even @entity38 , 51 , and @entity39 , 49 , are on either side of 50			0
@entity26 , on the other hand , is 39			0
( @entity50 , incidentally , was about to turn 37 when he took over " tonight " in 1962 ; @entity155 was 32 when the national " tonight " started in 1954			1
) he 's intimately familiar with the short attention spans of the internet age and has aimed his " @entity30 " at the sharable tendencies of the social - media cohort			1
that 's a plus at a time when @entity215 's @entity40 -- who 's 46 but still has the attitude of the snarky 30 - year - old he was on " @entity218 " -- was running even with @entity10 in the advertiser - desired 18 - 49 demographic			2
@entity26 also has the hipness of his support band , the roots , in his favor			0
and he 's moving " tonight " back to @entity60 for the first time since @entity50 took it to @entity226 , land of the cut - off @entity227 , in 1972			1
the @entity230 factor if @entity26 has a challenge , it 's the crowded and splintered competition in which there 's a late - night show for every taste			1
like tart political monologues ? you 're probably watching @entity38 and @entity39 on @entity238			0
@entity239 of @entity241 dish ? " @entity243 " on @entity242 is your spot			0
love @entity246 - or @entity248 - like in - depth interviews ? " @entity249 " is there for you on @entity251			0
but he and his old " snl " friend meyers have another secret weapon : their producer , @entity230			0
@entity230 , in fact , may be the real new king of late night			1
he now controls @entity13 's three biggest late - night shows : " tonight , " " @entity30 " and " snl			1
" he 's even familiar with the new " @entity30 " bandleader , " @entity258 " alum @entity259			0
( do n't laugh -- @entity259 is a fine musician			0
) @entity28 , the former " snl " head writer and " @entity261 " anchor , may be an unknown quantity as talk - show host , but @entity230 has faith			2
" in my opinion , he has until next fall to find that show			0
he should be taking chances			0
it ca n't spring full - blown from @entity270 ' thigh , " @entity230 told @entity53			0
@entity26 , of course , has already established himself			0
and though he 'd like to continue @entity10 's ratings lead , he does n't plan on changing much from the guy who made " @entity30 " his own			0
" i do n't think we have to win , " he told @entity195			0
" i just think we have to keep doing better			0

@entity1 takes over " @entity3 " on monday
show has long and storied history , but do viewers care about that ?
@entity50 dominated late - night tv from " tonight 's " perch
landscape of late night is now splintered into many shows
