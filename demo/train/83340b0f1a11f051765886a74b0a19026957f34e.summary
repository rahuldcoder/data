by the time the tear gas started to clear in @entity1 , @entity2 , at least 212 people had been arrested over nearly two weeks of clashes with police			1
a lot has been said about the fact that just a handful of them were actually from @entity1			2
but there 's more to the story			0
a close look at the official arrest logs of the @entity15 police , which @entity16 obtained friday , shows that while some people did travel to @entity1 to protest the shooting of a black teen by a white police officer , a majority of the people arrested live in the @entity25 area			1
more than half of them were charged with a relatively minor offense : refusing to disperse when asked by police			1
read the arrest log ( @entity31 ) @entity1 is a small suburban town , just 21,000 people packed into six square miles flush against @entity34			1
the unrest started when unarmed black teenager @entity36 was shot to death august 9 by @entity1 police officer @entity38			1
anger over the shooting , and the @entity1 police department 's initial refusal to identify the officer who shot @entity36 , set off nightly confrontations between police and protesters			1
the worst violence came nine days after the shooting : on monday into the wee hours of tuesday			2
police responded in militarized fashion , firing tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd and confiscating firearms , @entity55 cocktails and , reportedly , water bottles filled with urine			0
where is officer @entity38 ? the force of the police response has been sharply criticized			2
but the finger - pointing went both ways			0
some officials in @entity1 blamed outsiders for stirring up trouble			2
a deeper dive into the arrest logs and a search of social media and online news accounts show some self - avowed " communists " and others who could be considered " agitators			1
" but the vast majority of arrestees who gave out - of - town addresses were college students , peaceniks , legal advisers and journalists			0
the logs compiled by the @entity15 police cover august 10 through 22 and list 212 arrests in @entity1			1
they ca n't tell the full story , since they do not include arrests made by @entity1 police			1
they do not identify the arrestees by age or race			0
no incident reports are attached to provide details			0
@entity1 residents say police have a ' power trip problem ' but the numbers do tell this simple story : 130 people were charged with refusal to disperse , 18 or so with burglary -- which may or may not be related to looting -- and nine with disorderly conduct			1
a handful of people were charged with resisting arrest and two people were charged with careless driving			0
and , 20 people appear to have made a serious tactical error by joining the crowd in @entity1 : they were picked up on existing arrest or fugitive warrants			1
seven of the people arrested were journalists trying to cover the story			0
the list does not include reporters from the @entity124 and @entity125 , who were arrested in the early days of the protests			2
it does include a @entity129 photographer who was arrested , along with several international journalists and representatives from online media sites			0
an eighth was a college senior , a journalism major photographing the protests for a newspaper in @entity137			0
thursday night saw an eerie quiet descend , and the number of arrests dropped sharply ; only eight were reported			0
out of the glare , under the noise , other voices tell of a town called @entity1 what we know about @entity1			0
