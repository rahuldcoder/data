@entity1 contract security officers who responded to the terrorist attacks on the @entity4 ambassador in @entity5 , @entity6 , last year were told by the @entity1 to sign nondisclosure agreements just before a memorial ceremony at the @entity1 's headquarters in @entity10 , @entity11 , this past may , a congressional source told @entity13			1
the source says this was disclosed by the contractors during closed - door testimony on @entity18 this week , and it seems to contradict information sent by cia director @entity21 to the @entity22 investigating the events in @entity5			2
the @entity1 has repeatedly denied reports by @entity13 that the @entity1 has tried to prevent its personnel from talking to members of @entity27 investigating the september 2012 @entity5 attacks			1
when it was first reported by @entity13 , @entity21 released a letter showing that he strongly encouraged @entity1 operatives to cooperate with congressional investigators			2
@entity21 even went so far as to directly answer a question from @entity22 chairman @entity33 who , in a september 3 letter to the @entity1 director , specifically asked this question : " has any officer , either staff of contractor , been required to sign any nondisclosure agreement because of their presence at @entity5 or their participation in any activity related to the @entity5 attacks ? " @entity21 's answer : " no. " @entity1 contract operatives testifying before a classified @entity49 on wednesday and thursday directly contradicted @entity21 's answer , a congressional source told @entity13			1
@entity1 spokesman @entity51 told @entity13 that " there is absolutely no contradiction			0
" " @entity1 contractors routinely sign secrecy agreements , which are standard forms			1
no @entity1 officer has ever signed a secrecy agreement that referenced @entity5 or that prohibited them from talking to @entity27 , " @entity51 said in a statement			1
" in fact , @entity1 secrecy agreements specifically note an officer 's right to bring issues to the attention of @entity27			1
furthermore , director @entity21 extended to all @entity5 survivors an invitation to speak to @entity27 and indicated the @entity69 would support their interaction			2
several have spoken to @entity1 's oversight committees			0
" all five operatives were part of a security team hired by the @entity1 to protect its operations during missions in @entity6			2
' we were wrong ' : @entity80 's @entity79 apologizes for @entity5 report the official nondisclosure forms did not specifically mention the @entity5 investigation , but the source told @entity13 , " there is not a person in @entity87 who does n't understand why the forms were put in front of these people			1
" the @entity92 first reported the signing of additional nondisclosure agreements on thursday			0
@entity95 , an attorney representing three of the @entity1 contractors , told the @entity92 , " there is no doubt that the @entity100 ( nondisclosure agreements ) would not have been presented to them had it not been for @entity5			1
that is their impression and my analysis based on 20 years of experience			0
" @entity95 continued , " the @entity100 in no way changed the legal landscape			0
they had already signed @entity100 that bound them to certain obligations			0
these new ones were legally unnecessary			0
" the @entity1 contractors told to sign the nondisclosure agreements were attending a memorial service for @entity115 and @entity116 , two @entity1 operatives who died in the @entity5 attacks			1
this week , the @entity119 on @entity120 met to hear closed - door testimony from the former security agents			0
though the testimony is secret , the congressional source with inside knowledge of the hearing told @entity13 , " there now appears to be serious discrepancies " between what the @entity1 has officially reported to @entity27 and what the witnesses are telling members of the committee			2
@entity13 has learned a rescue team of five @entity1 operatives were armed and ready to respond to the terrorist attack within minutes of the first radio communication from ambassador @entity139 ' compound , but @entity13 sources say the agents were told to stand down			1
the allegation was first raised last year , after which the @entity1 told @entity27 there was no order to stand down			1
the @entity1 has said " no one at any level in the @entity1 told anybody not to help those in need ; claims to the contrary are simply inaccurate			0
" @entity152 believe they need to have more information to determine why a discrepancy now exists between the would - be rescuers on the ground and the official reports from the @entity1			0
the agents eventually did respond to the attack , pulling off a heroic attempt to save @entity162 officials who were under siege			0
intelligence officials explained last year that there was a roughly 25 - minute gap from the initial call for help to when half a dozen officers were able to make a move -- and that the delay was due to the time it took to load weapons and equipment and coordinate with friendly militias .			0

@entity1 has said contractors not required to sign nondisclosure forms about @entity5
but questions are raised about the timing , intent of the forms
contractors who responded to terror attacks in @entity6 tell their story to @entity27
ambassador @entity139 and three other @entity4 were killed
