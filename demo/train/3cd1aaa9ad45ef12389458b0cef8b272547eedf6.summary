-- the salmonella outbreak that led to the recall of 380 million eggs was preventable and will likely grow , federal officials said thursday			1
hundreds of @entity7 likely have become ill from tainted eggs in recent months , according to estimates from the @entity6 , @entity6 spokeswoman @entity5 said thursday			1
from may 1 to july 31 , a total of 1,953 cases of salmonella enteritidis were reported ; the expected number of such cases ordinarlily in that time would be about 700 , dr. @entity16 , acting director of the @entity6 's division of food - borne , waterborne and environmental diseases , said in a conference call thursday			1
the @entity6 is not yet sure exactly how many cases can be attributed to this particular outbreak			1
the salmonella outbreak prompted @entity26 of @entity27 , @entity28 , to increase its recall wednesday to 380 million eggs			1
the number of salmonella cases is expected to grow because any that occurred after july 17 may not yet be reported due to a two - to three - week lag between when a person becomes sick and when the case gets reported in the system , the @entity6 said			1
" we would certainly characterize this as one of the largest shell egg recalls in recent history , " @entity37 of the @entity38 said in a conference call thursday			2
on july 9 , the @entity38 announced it had new safety rules for large - scale egg producers , but that came after the salmonella outbreak apparently began			1
" the outbreak could have been prevented			0
" the egg safety rule is in a phase - in approach , but there are measures that would have been in place that could have prevented this if it been placed earlier than in july			1
" @entity38 's new rules cover refrigeration of stored and transported eggs , pasteurization , rodent control , cleanliness and a required written salmonella enteritidis prevention plan			1
the agency said " implementing the preventive measures would reduce the number of @entity68 infections from eggs by nearly 60 percent			2
" producers with more than 50,000 laying hens , or about 80 percent of the market , were to comply by now			0
the regulations requires " egg producers with fewer than 50,000 but at least 3,000 laying hens whose shell eggs are not processed with a treatment , such as pasteurization , to comply with the regulation by july 9 , 2012			1
" the @entity81 , an advocacy group , said the @entity38 needs a strong inspection force			0
health departments across the country are tracking cases of salmonella and dispensing advice to citizens			2
@entity90 , for example , has seen a twofold increase in salmonella reports , with an uptick beginning in june , said dr. @entity94 , food - borne disease epidemiologist for the state @entity96			2
thoroughly cooking eggs kills salmonella bacteria within , but there is still risk of cross-contamination if a food preparer does n't properly wash kitchen utensils , such as whisks or spatulas , that came into contact with the raw eggs			1
undercooked food also leaves the consumer at risk of infection			0
@entity68 , which is generally contracted from contaminated poultry , meat , eggs , or water , affects the intestinal tract			1
symptoms include diarrhea , fever and abdominal cramps , which typically begin within 12 to 72 hours , according to the @entity6			1
vomiting , chills , headache and muscle pains also may occur , according to the @entity125			0
these symptoms last about four to seven days , and then go away without specific treatment in healthy people			0
@entity130 medications may help with cramps , but they may also prolong the diarrhea , the @entity125 said			0
the elderly , infants , and people with impaired immune systems are at heightened risk for developing a more serious illness because of salmonella , the @entity6 said			1
some people can develop life - threatening complications if the infection spreads beyond the intestines			0
chickens can pass the bacteria to eggs because the eggs leave hens through the same passageway as feces , according to the @entity7 @entity151 's @entity150			1
alternatively , bacteria in the hen 's ovary or oviduct can get to the egg before the shell forms around it , @entity150 said			1
@entity26 added several more batches and brands to the recall wednesday afternoon			1
" @entity26 is fully cooperating with @entity38 's investigation by undertaking this voluntary recall , " the company said in a statement			1
" our primary concern is keeping salmonella out of the food supply and away from consumers			2
as a precautionary measure , @entity26 also has decided to divert its existing inventory of shell eggs from the recalled plants to a breaker , where they will be pasteurized to kill any salmonella bacteria present			1
" after the uptick in salmonella infections , the @entity6 and the @entity38 traced the source and determined it was most likely eggs from @entity26			1
the company says it is working to determine how the shell eggs are being contaminated			2
the @entity6 reported thursday evening that more than one person became ill in 26 restaurants in 10 states			1
information showed that @entity26 was an egg supplier to 15 of the restaurants			1
@entity189 , director of food safety programs at the @entity191 , reiterated that only shell eggs are affected by the @entity194 recall			2
" from what we know they only do shell eggs , and if they did extra egg products , they are still considered to be safe , " @entity195 said			2
she added that egg products such as egg whites and dried eggs go through pasteurization and extensive heat treatment , so they 're considered safe to eat and the @entity191 is not concerned the other products might be sullied with bacteria			2
@entity210 on thursday said it is voluntary recalling specific @entity213 dates of shell eggs produced by @entity26			1
eggs were distributed to food wholesalers , distribution centers and food - service companies in @entity219 , @entity90 and @entity220 , according to a statement			2
eggs were packaged under the @entity210 brand name in 15 dozen bulk pack with the identifying plant code of @entity226 and p 1026			0
@entity213 code dates are 216 - 221			0
dates and codes can be found on the box label			0
wednesday 's recall covers eggs branded as @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 and are marked with a three - digit code ranging from 136 to 229 and plant numbers1720 and 1942 , the company said			2
in addition , @entity247 , which , on its website , calls itself the largest distributor of shell eggs in the western @entity7 , announced thursday it was " voluntarily recalling specific ... dates of shell eggs produced by @entity26 and packaged by @entity247 because they have the potential to be contaminated with @entity68			1
" the earlier recall covered the @entity256 , @entity235 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity236 , @entity260 , @entity242 , @entity261 and @entity263 brands that were marked with with a three - digit code ranging from 136 to 225 and plant numbers 1026 , 1413 and 1946			0
the four - digit plant number begins with " p - " and is followed by the three - digit code			0
both recalls affect eggs packed in several different sized cartons , from a half - dozen to 18 eggs			0
only shell eggs are affected by the recall , the company said			0
consumers are encouraged to return the eggs in their original packaging to where they were purchased for a full refund			0
eggs have not been a major source of infection in humans for this particular strain of salmonella , enteritidis , in the last twoor three years , said @entity287 at @entity289 's @entity288			1
a big outbreak like this one is out of the norm , he said			0
ideally , when a chick becomes a candidate to become an egg - laying hen , it is put in a clean environment with clean water and feed , he said			0
but that is not always the case , he said			0
rodents can get in the feed , and their feces can transmit bacteria to the birds			0
one @entity308 woman infected by salmonella has filed a lawsuit against a restaurant that allegedly served contaminated eggs linked to the nationwide outbreak of the potentially deadly bacteria			1
plaintiff @entity315 , 27 , from @entity316 , @entity308 , said she got sick after eating at the @entity317 in @entity318 , @entity308 , in june			0
she recently retained the @entity320 , @entity321 - based law firm @entity319 , which specializes in food poisoning cases , and amended her lawsuit against the restaurant to include @entity26			2
@entity324 , the @entity319 attorney co-representing @entity315 , said thursday although she returned to work a while ago , after a week of acute illness , she suffers from ongoing gastrointestinal problems			0
in the legal complaint , @entity319 says , " defendant @entity317 and @entity328 purchased and used in the manufacture of its menu items @entity68 - contaminated shell eggs subject to defendant @entity26 's august 16 , 2010 recall			1
" the @entity336 closed the restaurant on july 13 to investigate an outbreak of " at least 30 confirmed salmonella enteritidis illnesses ... including the plaintiff 's , " according to the complaint			1
the restaurant has since reopened			0
@entity324 said even though @entity194 has recalled the eggs , @entity317 will remain part of the lawsuit			2
he said when so many people in one restaurant became ill that it should have raised red flags and called the food - handling practices into question			0
the 30 cases of salmonella reported in @entity318 came from no specific source and not all the people were connected to the restaurant , said @entity357 , assistant director of nursing for the health department			2
she was n't certain how many may have been tied to the restaurant , which she said was closed for a week as " a precaution			0
" she indicated that @entity317 has been inspected and employees were educated on proper food handling			0
there were no findings of food - borne sources of salmonella , but she could n't comment on whether any employees tested positive for the disease at the time			0
@entity370 , llc , which owns the @entity372 and two other @entity318 restaurants , did not respond to repeated @entity0 requests for comment			0
@entity0 's @entity376 , @entity377 , @entity378 and @entity379 contributed to this report			0
