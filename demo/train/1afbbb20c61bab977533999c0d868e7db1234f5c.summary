it 's a powerful thing : the airline window seat			1
shutterbugs are drawn to them			2
and some of us ca n't not look out the window			1
see @entity9 ' window seat photos statistics suggest that window seat passengers may enjoy their flights more			1
but changes are afoot for this travel touchstone			2
some of the most desirable window seats come at a premium now			1
and that may shift how we feel about them			2
and let 's face it , if all the photos snapped from airplane windows are any indication , we love them			2
why all the love ? sure , the stunning 30,000 - foot views are cool			2
but for some travelers , it 's deeper than that			2
really ? can you analyze a traveler 's personality by their favorite airplane seat ? of course not ; do n't be ridiculous			1
but let 's do it anyway			2
first , let 's take a look at the aisle seaters , who are passionate in their own right about airline seating			1
screw the view ; these folks are all business			0
" the aisle person is looking to get some work done , " said @entity47 , @entity49 's travel blogger			0
they want quick access to the cabin door -- or the restroom			0
and to get that access , they 're willing to put up with collisions with passing airline attendants and rattling snack carts			1
aisle seaters sacrifice frequently standing up and sitting down -- and returning their " folding trays to their full upright position " -- to make way for the middle and window seaters			1
for window seaters , it 's not just about the view ( or something to lean on )			1
it 's about the experience ! these fliers often are the true romantics			0
need proof ? search # windowseat on @entity76 and you 'll find plenty of tweeters waxing about windows			0
like @entity81 : tweeting travelers have a lot of love for @entity86 's 2010 hit song " @entity87			1
" you 'll find tweeters singing it -- virtually -- online			0
" can i get a win - dow seat ? do n't want nobody ... next to me , " the lyrics read			1
" i just wan na ticket outta town ... a look around ... and a safe touch down			0
i just wan na chance to fly ... a chance to cry ... and a long bye - bye			0
" when it comes to heart - wrenching separations , the aisle seat just does n't pack the same cinematic punch			1
it 's been a century since the first @entity108 commercial airline took to the sky			1
in that time , the window seat has become for many the best part of flying in an industry where complaints are all too frequent and the novelty of flight has faded			1
it attracts certain kinds of travelers , but it also can transform them			0
" it 's a calmer seat , " @entity47 says			2
stats on airline seats are hard to come by , but anecdotally , front aisle seats are " generally considered most desirable " among @entity49 customers , @entity47 says			1
at @entity124 , 21 % of customers over the past year picked window seats , 20 % chose the aisle , and the rest had no preference			1
a @entity130 satisfaction survey for @entity132 passengers showed slightly higher preference for windows over aisles			0
the consumer data collection site @entity137 reports nearly seven out of 10 respondents prefer windows			0
" window choosers are more likely to be younger , female , shorter and more casual than their aisle compatriots , " @entity137 wrote			2
" they 're also more likely to be into nature			0
" here 's what 's changing : airlines are charging premium prices for some window and aisle seats			1
and that 's forcing passengers to choose the dreaded middle seat			2
it also makes it more difficult for families to sit in the same row if they 're not willing to pay extra			0
airlines with preferred seating fees include @entity108 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161			1
charging more for preferred seating offers passengers more seating choices and flexibility , @entity161 said in june			1
this is shifting " the way that people view the window seat , " @entity47 said			1
" it has become even more of a premium			0
" fliers stung by window , aisle fees it 's not all blue skies with the window seats			1
the @entity178 issued new health guidelines this year warning that sitting in window seats on long - distance flights can increase some people 's risk of developing life - threatening blood clots called deep vein thrombosis			1
combine that with a higher risk of wetting yourself and stepping on strangers ' toes , and you can see how far passengers are willing to go for those killer views			0
guidelines dispute " economy class syndrome " and of course , who better to ask about the best air views than airline pilots ? they tell us that -- generally -- window seaters love flying in and out of @entity202 ; @entity203 , @entity204 ; @entity205 ; @entity206 and @entity207			1
@entity209 's @entity208 has an eye - popping approach known to pilots as " river visual , " says pilot @entity214			2
the plane flies low over the @entity216 , giving passengers on the left side amazing views of the @entity220 , the @entity221 and the @entity222			0
the descent into @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity214 says , " is spectacular , with unbelievable mountaintops just skimming below the aircraft			0
" best seats : right side			2
and then there 's the constant reminder that you 're in a metal tube at 30,000 feet			0
in a famous 1963 episode of " @entity236 , " @entity234 plays a mentally disturbed flier who watches helplessly through the window while a gremlin tears the plane apart			1
" it taps into that universal thought of ' if @entity247 intended us to fly , we would have wings , ' " the " @entity243 " star told @entity244			0
" a lot of people getting on an airplane to this day still ca n't figure out why it flies			0
" watch a two - minute version of " @entity236 " episode window psychology factored into @entity256 's new @entity255 , says @entity257 , ceo of the @entity259 design firm			2
@entity257 told @entity261 magazine that designers wanted to " bring some romance back " to air travel by reconnecting passengers " to actually flying			0
" result : bigger windows			0
dreamliner windows measure 19 inches tall , 65 % larger than the industry standard , according to @entity256			0
the cool factor on these portals is high : a gel inside the glass allows passengers to brighten or darken the outside sunlight with the touch of a button			0
finally , a word of advice from award - winning travel blogger @entity279 of @entity281 : do n't be the " inconsiderate window seat guy			1
" if sunlight is burning through your window when many passengers are trying to sleep , please shut your shade			2
otherwise , @entity279 writes , you 'll be called out as " heinous and rotten and selfish			0
" and you do n't want that -- no matter how amazing your view is			0
so ... which airplane seat do you prefer ? why ? what does your choice say about your personality ? should airlines charge fees to book preferred window seats ? we 're interested in your opinions and experiences			1
