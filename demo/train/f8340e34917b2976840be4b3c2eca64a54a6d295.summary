-- in the high - tech world of @entity3 , it 's difficult to find someone who is n't plugged in			1
demand here is fulfilled by the country 's largest mobile phone carrier , @entity9			1
ceo of @entity9 , @entity10 spoke to @entity0 's @entity12 in @entity13			1
it 's ubiquitous branding hints at the 51 percent market share the company holds			1
earlier this year the company broke with @entity3 's rigid corporate tradition			1
they scrapped the hierarchy in favor of a flatter management structure in the hope of encouraging risk taking and creativity			2
these decisions were the making of ceo , @entity10 , who 's been at the helm since 2004			1
he sat down with @entity0 's @entity12 to explain the hidden value of corporate culture			1
@entity10 : i think we need to be more creative and innovative in order to be a global communications leader			2
to create a new culture , we broke from the @entity39 tradition of seniority based hierarchical structure by introducing a single level manager system			2
this is for the open - minded communication and knowledge sharing between employees and a speedy organizational process			0
we introduced it more than a year ago and i think it 's selling quite well			2
@entity12 : so how difficult was it to get your people on board with these changes ? @entity10 : @entity3 is basically a @entity56 culture , so we respect the elders and the senior people			1
so with the senior people , the hard debate with the senior people is the difficulty			0
but by introducing the single level structure we could encourage more free communication			0
@entity12 : since the 1960s , the @entity3 economy has developed enormously , so why was there a need to change it ? @entity10 : as you know , during the last several decades of @entity3 economic growth , manufacturing was the real core industry			1
in manufacturing the hierarchy code -- the strong top down leadership -- is very effective and sometimes very efficient			0
now the world is changing , especially for it services and communication services			0
creativity and innovation from the very free communication knowledge sharing is more and more important so i think we need that kind of change especially for @entity9			2
@entity12 : today is the company 's monthly " @entity84 " -- a lunch - time entertainment for employees held in the lobby of @entity9 's headquarters			1
@entity10 : i think the happy employees can make others happy			2
their work their productivity will improve			0
so every month during lunch time , we introduce the talent -- professionals of music , dance , or drum players for employees			0
it will also help the creative and flexible corporate culture , i think			0
all those have the synergy to change the culture			0
i think the corporate culture is much more important than the system or process			0
our business environment changes very quickly			0
once the system or process is set up , then it might have some other shackle for us to change			0
but the corporate culture drives the people , even though they are not the older this would do it this way and that way , so corporate culture i think is very important			0
@entity12 : we 've been talking a lot about the softer issues , about softer employee relations , rather than the structure and processes of corporate @entity3			1
do you think the softer issues are becoming more important right across industry here ? @entity10 : i think with the rise of @entity128 and @entity129 as a manufacturing base , we need to be more toward the service oriented company which requires more creativity , so i think it 's very natural			1
but i think that creativity and efficiency should take balance that 's why we also strongly implement the activities at @entity9 together			1
so it 's this kind of ambidexterity , efficiency and creativity should take balance			0
