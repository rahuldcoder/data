-- the " tweet heard round the world " was followed by the sound of a slamming door saturday			1
media company @entity6 has " parted ways " with company pr executive @entity7 over her tweet : " going to @entity10			1
hope i do n't get @entity12			0
i 'm white ! " " the offensive comment does not reflect the views and values of @entity6			2
we take this issue very seriously , and we have parted ways with the employee in question , " an @entity6 spokesman said in a statement			2
" there is no excuse for the hateful statements that have been made and we condemn them unequivocally , " he said			1
" we hope , however , that time and action , and the forgiving human spirit , will not result in the wholesale condemnation of an individual who we have otherwise known to be a decent person at core			0
" @entity7 did not immediately respond to messages left by @entity0			0
the tweet @entity7 sent before she left friday for @entity36 , @entity10 , went viral and created a social media firestorm			1
the incident -- @entity39 called it " the tweet heard round the world " -- was a glaring reminder that every word uttered on the internet can be heard by seemingly everyone on the @entity43 , sometimes with serious consequences			0
@entity7 was the head of corporate communications for @entity6 , the media company chaired by @entity51 that operates websites such as @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
her whole job revolved around communicating with reporters -- which made her @entity60 comment about @entity10 all the more shocking			2
@entity7 was in @entity61 and about to begin a long vacation in @entity10 when she wrote the message			0
her @entity60 account was relatively obscure when she posted it -- fewer than 500 people were following it			1
but the message went viral on friday , unbeknownst to @entity7 , who apparently did not have internet access on her flight			1
websites such as @entity71 and @entity72 highlighted @entity7 's account , and soon it had thousands of followers -- and thousands of harsh replies directed at it			1
others said they felt sorry for @entity7 , regardless of how offensive her @entity60 message was , because she had n't had a chance to defend herself during the 12 - hour flight			1
as @entity60 observers parsed through her public posts , many were disturbed by her previous messages			0
( " i had a sex dream about an autistic kid last night , " she once wrote			0
) her account was a laundry list of banal complaints about poor customer service and other apparent indignities			0
" it seems she has left a trail of casual racism across social media on her various travels , " @entity94 , a writer for @entity95 , opined			0
still , @entity94 wrote , " it was hard to ignore a disturbing feeling in the mob 's response " to the @entity60 messages " and something creepy in the trial by social media that was going on in her absence			2
" on friday afternoon , with hours to go before she landed , another corporate communications representative for @entity6 issued a statement that tried to address the online controversy			1
" this is an outrageous , offensive comment that does not reflect the views and values of @entity6 , " the company said			0
" unfortunately , the employee in question is unreachable on an international flight , but this is a very serious matter and we are taking appropriate action			0
" the statement led many to believe that @entity7 would be reprimanded or even terminated when she landed in @entity10			0
parody accounts started to appear on @entity60 and @entity126 that portrayed @entity7 as a mean , bitter person			1
on friday evening a @entity60 hashtag , # @entity129 , became a running commentary about @entity7 ; some people observed that she 'd have to put her crisis communications expertise to the test to save her own career			1
meanwhile , other @entity60 users started scoping out @entity7 's past messages and flagged other questionable comments she 'd made before , like this one : " i ca n't be fired for things i say while intoxicated right ? " all of those messages disappeared , though , early on saturday , when someone -- presumably @entity7 -- deleted her @entity60 account			1
@entity6 had no immediate comment about how or why her account was removed			2
some good does seem to have come out of the incident , at least			0
advocates for @entity12 relief set up websites to encourage donations ; one of the sites read , " the aids epidemic is bigger than a tweet from a person in @entity155 if we want real change , we need to think beyond @entity7			2
let 's turn that anger into something tangible			0
