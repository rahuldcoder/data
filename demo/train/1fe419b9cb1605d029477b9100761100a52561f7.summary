-- sometimes it takes a tragedy to make us confront reality			2
in the wake of the slaughter of first graders in @entity9 , @entity10 , there are signs that the country -- and @entity13 -- are ready to confront the cancer of gun violence that kills over 11,000 @entity16 each year			1
more than 200 @entity16 have been killed in mass shootings in the last five years			1
after each attack -- whether it was @entity19 or @entity20 , @entity21 -- we were told that it was too soon to talk about the role of guns			1
now , the fever of denial might be breaking			2
a new @entity30 / @entity29 poll taken after the shooting shows that 54 % of @entity16 now support stricter gun laws and 59 % support a nationwide ban on high - capacity ammunition clips -- meaning those that contain more than 10 bullets			1
the big question of course is whether @entity13 will listen			2
this has not been an area where politicians have carved out a new chapter of profiles in courage in recent years			0
instead , they have run away in the face of the lobbying power of the @entity49			0
but in the past two days , two @entity52 @entity51 senators with a-ratings from the @entity49 have broken ranks to say that it is time to begin a serious , civil and constructive conversation about remedies to mass gun violence -- including perhaps a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban and a restriction of high - capacity clips			1
@entity64 sen. @entity63 -- who famously took aim at a cap and trade bill with a high - powered hunting rifle in a 2010 campaign ad -- told @entity0 's @entity70 that the @entity9 shooting " changed me			1
... i do n't know of anybody that goes hunting with an assault rifle			0
i do n't know people that need 10 - , 20 - , 30 - round clips			0
" add to this chorus of conscience @entity64 sen. @entity79 -- a fellow former governor and current senator			0
he told a local @entity84 tv station : " i believe every @entity16 has 2nd amendment right -- the ability to hunt is part of our culture			0
i 've had an @entity49 rating of an @entity92 but you know , enough is enough			0
i 'm a father of three daughters and this weekend they said , ' @entity95 , how can this go on ? ' " these two senators are leaders of the centrist coalition , and their evolution on this issue matters			0
it is particularly well timed because sen. @entity101 announced her intention to submit legislation to reinstate the lapsed assault weapons ban as well as ban " big clips , drums or strips of more than 10 bullets			0
" that bill would provide the substantive basis for a new round of reasonable restrictions on weapons that have little purpose other than to kill as many people as possible , as quickly as possible			0
to date , there are few @entity118 who have newly embraced the need for new gun legislation			1
rep. @entity121 and sen. @entity122 of @entity123 are influential , but among the few returning congressional @entity118 who back the reinstatement of the assault weapons ban and restrictions on the sale of mass capacity magazines			0
but the senators who have boasted the backing of the @entity49 in the past have been notably silent since the slaughter in @entity9			1
that can fairly be read as a hope that this moment will pass			2
@entity137 mayor @entity136 , an independent , has been leading the gun crusade in recent years through his group @entity139			2
in many areas , @entity16 's mayors have been leading the policy debate in our nation , and this organization 's message has taken on new urgency , unveiling an effort to encourage supporters to " @entity150 " from @entity151			1
in the wake of the @entity9 shootings , nine new mayors decided to join the group , including the mayors of @entity157 , @entity158 , and @entity159 , @entity160 -- major cities in the heart of gun country , the @entity164 and @entity64			1
in this and so many other areas , the fact is that @entity16 are less polarized than our politicians			0
a poll commissioned by @entity139 and conducted by conservative pollster @entity171 found that 74 % of @entity49 members supported background checks on every gun sale			1
the larger point is that there is common ground to be found even on this emotional issue -- especially if mental health is part of the civic conversation , because self - control and gun control are intertwined			1
there is a responsibility to remember after events like this -- a need for sustained focus after the heat of the moment passes			2
real change will require constructive civic conversation , the kind that @entity63 noted has become rare , saying : " it 's a shame that we 've gotten so toxic a political environment that today in @entity151 that you ca n't sit down and have reasonable discussions with reasonable people to come out to reasonable conclusions			0
" but there is a moral urgency to follow through on this moment			1
the normal politically convenient amnesia ca n't be allowed to set in			0
more senators need to be pressed on the issue of reasonable restrictions and prodded by the polls			0
@entity101 's proposed bill will no doubt start a substantive debate			2
as president @entity219 said in his memorial address in @entity9 , " no single law , no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society			1
... but that ca n't be an excuse for inaction			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

@entity227 : the horrific shootings in @entity9 changed debate on guns
he says several *pro-gun* *democrats* have spoken out for new controls
@entity227 : a poll shows a boost in public support for gun control
there is a moral urgency to follow through on this moment , he says
