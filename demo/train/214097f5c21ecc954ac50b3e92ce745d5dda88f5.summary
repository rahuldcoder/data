@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's @entity1 mansion resembles a frat house , according to a detective who searched it last week			1
" why you in my house , bro ? " @entity4 asked after a dozen deputies woke him up at 8 a.m. on january 14 , @entity12 's lt. @entity11 told @entity2 friday			1
he detected " a little sense of entitlement " from the 19 - year - old pop star , although he said @entity4 was cooperative			1
@entity4 did n't use foul language , @entity11 said , as he allegedly did with police in @entity19 when he was arrested there early wednesday			1
deputies had a search warrant to look for evidence connected to an egg assault on a neighboring mansion five days earlier , which caused damage that will cost at least $ 20,000 to repair , @entity11 said			1
" the house does operate much like a fraternity house and much of the same stuff that 's done there is going to be done across the country , " @entity11 said			1
" but the house next door is usually another fraternity house			1
it 's not usually a mansion that can sustain this damage			2
" @entity4 has decorated the living room of his $ 6.5 million home with ping pong and pool tables , a ms. @entity43 video game and a basketball free - throw machine , @entity11 said			1
the main feature of his back yard is a skateboard ramp covered with spray - painted graffiti			0
" it was kind of like a fraternity house , but no signs of drugs , " @entity11 said , contradicting some media reports that deputies overlook evidence of illegal drug use			1
" i walked through every room of the house			2
i was the third person through the door			0
so , it 's not hearsay			2
i did n't see any of that			0
" a deputy did find suspected illegal drugs at the bedside of @entity4 house guest @entity66 -- real name @entity68			1
lab tests returned to investigators friday confirmed one of the drugs in the 20 - year - old rapper 's possession was mdma -- also known as @entity76 or @entity76 , @entity11 said			2
@entity66 has been charged with a felony drug charge			0
" if there 's other things , such as drugs , that are right there in plain view , then we 're going to deal with that as well , which we did , " he said			2
" but our goal in going in there was the security video			0
" detectives seized the computer that controls the extensive security video system protecting @entity4 's sprawling estate			1
what it recorded the night of the alleged egging will be shown to prosecutors next week as they decide if @entity4 should be charged with felony vandalism , he said			1
" i believe there was some things captured on the video , " @entity11 said friday			0
" we 're going over that right now			0
we will probably be done with that , i 'm assuming , today			0
we will then have a dialogue with the district attorney			0
" it will be up to the prosecutor to decide if the egg attack evidence justifies a felony vandalism charge against the singer			1
@entity4 's ' wake up call ' the knock on @entity4 's door last week was " quite a wake - up call , " @entity11 said			1
" and he needs a wake - up call			0
" deputies have responded " numerous times " to complaints by @entity4 's neighbors about loud parties , fast driving and even an incident in which @entity4 allegedly spat on a neighbor			1
but no charges have ever resulted			0
" we do n't do search warrants to send messages , but make no mistake , we hope that messages are received , " lt. @entity11 said			0
" we do search warrants to collect evidence , but this is a person who 's been wreaking havoc on the neighborhood , who 's been operating , basically , with impunity because he has n't spoken to us in the past about anything that went on			2
" @entity4 apparently did n't take the warning to heart , based on the druken driving arrest in @entity19 wednesday , @entity11 said			2
the exclusive @entity145 in @entity0 is home to the rich and famous , including @entity148 's mother and children			0
@entity150 previously lived on the same street that @entity4 moved to nearly two years ago			2
" people move to that neighborhood -- which is a gated community -- for the peace , quiet , and tranquility that it provides , " @entity11 said			0
" so , mr. @entity4 's past actions of loud parties , driving too fast , large numbers of people there , egging and what not are way out of character for anyone that lives in that neighborhood			1
" the sheriff 's department 's goal is " to try to improve the quality of the neighborhood and make sure people get the help that they need , " he said			0
" in some cases , that help is jail time			0
in some cases , that help is a wake - up call			0

" why you in my house , bro ? " @entity4 asks deputy with a warrant
