@entity0 @entity3 2016 presidential maneuvering dominated our sunday trip around the " @entity7 " table : the cast changes , somewhat , at the annual @entity9 , but for years the format has been the same : back - to - back - to - back - to - back speeches by politicians and activists			1
but this year will be different , and perhaps include some interesting interaction involving 2016 @entity3 presidential hopefuls			1
@entity18 's @entity17 had the scoop on some of the new format ideas on the table as the planning enters its final stages			1
" they 're going to try to have as many of the candidates on stage as they can , maybe with an anchor asking them questions , then maybe have their board members asking the questions , have people from the audience asking them questions , " he said			0
" and that 's part of the @entity9 trying to say to @entity3 , ' we 're going to play a role in vetting these people			1
here 's what they look like without a teleprompter			0
' " it 's no surprise that @entity46 sen. @entity45 will be speaking to two big conservative gatherings this month : the annual conferences of @entity9 and @entity49			1
but this will be fun to watch : an incursion into " enemy " territory			0
@entity45 has agreed to be the keynote speaker next week at the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 -- home territory of @entity3 prospects @entity59 and @entity60			1
@entity45 is also staffing up as he gets closer to making the obvious official			2
@entity1 is told that longtime @entity63 spokesman and strategist @entity62 is joining the @entity45 political operation , adding a veteran communications operative with @entity0 and presidential campaign experience to the team			2
@entity59 is an obvious winner now that @entity70 has bowed out of the 2016 @entity3 race : the two leading establishment figures were courting many of the same donors and operatives			1
but @entity77 gov. @entity76 also sensed an opening and acted quickly , and @entity1 's @entity79 tells us it was a smart and effective play			1
" he has been as aggressive as @entity59 in making phone calls and hiring staff , digital people , fundraisers , " said @entity79			0
" this is really interesting to watch , because the invisible primary is not just about poll numbers and who 's up and who 's down			0
it 's what you 're doing with it			0
and he 's actually done a lot , especially with the departure of @entity70 from the field			1
" @entity100 's senior senator , @entity99 , says he might make a long - shot bid for the @entity3 nomination			1
now , his junior colleague , sen. @entity103 , is making moves to expand his influence in the state that votes third in the nominating process			0
@entity103 this week is playing host to @entity110 gov. @entity109 , yet another 2016 prospect , for a forum about educational choice			2
and @entity114 of the @entity115 reports that it 's part of an effort by @entity103 to expand his national profile and influence in the presidential race			2
he is up for re-election in 2016 , and he plans to help his campaign by inviting all of the @entity3 presidential contenders to join him			1
" not certain yet whether or not he 'll actually make an endorsement , " said @entity124			0
" someone asked him whether or not @entity99 runs , whether or not that would be an automatic endorsement			0
he said maybe , maybe not			0
" his endorsement would help , and @entity124 says that while @entity103 very much likes and respects his colleague @entity99 , he ca n't take things for granted			0
@entity70 decided against a third run for the presidency in 2016 , but @entity134 are n't ready to throw away their anti-romney playbook just yet			1
as long as @entity59 has a prominent place in the @entity3 field , the @entity134 think -- @entity138 of @entity139 tells us -- those notes might still come in handy			2
" they both worked in finance , they both backed the @entity146 bailout , they both opposed the auto bailout , " said @entity138			0
" after @entity59 makes his speeches , you sometimes get notes from @entity134 saying : ' oh , look how similar this is to things @entity70 said			2
' " the obvious advantage for @entity59 is that he 's seen this playbook run before			0
he may be able to come up with a better strategy than @entity70			2

the @entity9 is considering a new format for the 2016 candidates
@entity45 is planning a @entity57 incursion , and he 's made a new hire
@entity77 gov. @entity76 *seizes* the moment as @entity70 exits the @entity3 race
