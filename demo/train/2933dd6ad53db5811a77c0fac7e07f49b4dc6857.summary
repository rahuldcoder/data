-- @entity2 's music industry is flourishing			1
however , it faces a big threat -- the scourge of piracy			2
but the tide is changing , say the country 's top music stars , who are stepping up efforts to reform the industry and are putting pressure on the government to crackdown on pirates			1
one of @entity2 's most celebrated artists is among those calling for action to stamp out the problem			1
" piracy is still a very massive issue because there is no control in terms of producing the cds and no barcodes			2
you do n't even know where it is coming from , " said hip - hop and @entity28 star @entity26 , popularly known as @entity29			1
idibia is no stranger to the international scene and his music has won him a string of awards both at home and abroad			2
but while he has been recognized for his work he feels that back home there is a lack of respect for artists and that the police do not view piracy as a serious crime			1
" a policeman might be standing here , someone might be selling pirated copies over there and he would n't even look at it as though someone is committing a crime and he might even buy one ! " he said			0
" they love the music , they want to listen to it , they dance to it , they buy the pirated copies , but the respect for the actual intellectual property is not there , " he continued			2
only a decade ago , there were only one or two compact disc production plants			0
today there are 28 in operation and the country has its own copyright commission , the @entity73 ( @entity73 )			0
according to the latest @entity75 report released in 2011 from the @entity73 , piracy of cds , vcds , @entity80 cost just over $ 3.5 million a year			2
but despite the increase in popularity and availability of discs , the ceo of one of @entity84 's leading media and entertainment companies thinks piracy is hindering the country 's success on the international stage			2
" when the international majors were in @entity2 they never invested in the back end of the industry , so there is no formal distribution in place , " said @entity94 , founder of @entity95			1
" there needs to be major investment into distribution and we are speaking to some of the major fulfillment companies , " he continued			0
" the key issue is that @entity2 businesses need to recognize that this is a significant opportunity which might be worth over a couple of billion dollars a year			1
" @entity2 's @entity114 poet @entity94 believes that the mobile industry could be the key place to push @entity118 music legitimately			1
he is helping to launch @entity119 , a music download service going live in december			0
" we have over 90 million mobiles in @entity2 and over 40 million are in the youth space			1
the key issues facing the industry are the need to build a proper touring platform , a live scene , and also for major companies and government to begin to pay for the use of music across all platforms , " he said			0
" we think @entity119 will make a major impact in terms of getting real revenues back to artists , labels , producers and managers returns on their music , " he added			0
last year the industry decided to close ranks and establish the @entity144 of @entity2 ( @entity145 ) to give advice to artists about copyright and licensing their music			1
the collective also promotes the rights of artists and acts as an industry watchdog			0
the @entity73 and @entity145 are backing storm 360 to release an anti-piracy song early next year as part of a wider national campaign			0
@entity94 hopes that artists like @entity29 will get involved to help educate music fans about the problem of piracy			1
" education , communication , campaign -- if you do not educate people you can not expect them to know there is a real problem , " he said			2
@entity26 says the issue of piracy is even more aggravating considering the difficulties @entity2 artists face in getting their music to market			1
he compares the emergence of artists in @entity84 to " rose flowers growing from rocks			0
" but he says the good thing about the @entity118 music scene is artists are not afraid to speak up for what they believe in , which could help improve their rights			0
" the trend is we get ourselves involved in everything that affects our lives and we speak out			0
we talk about it , " he said .			0
