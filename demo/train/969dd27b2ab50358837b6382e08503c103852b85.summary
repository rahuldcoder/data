is a major milestone in the almost six - decade history of space exploration			1
it is just the latest sign that the old paradigm of government - only space travel is being replaced by something else -- a new business ecosystem composed of novel relationships among @entity20 and the aerospace industry			1
no longer will @entity20 own the @entity8 " trucking company " -- specifying every nut and bolt			0
instead , @entity20 is buying services from @entity6 industry			1
to be sure , the new announcement made it clear that @entity20 will be carefully examining the safety aspects of each design			0
but the designs will still be those of @entity2 and @entity3 and vetted by @entity20			1
i believe this new approach is @entity6 's " secret weapon " in what some have described as a space race with @entity39			1
and , as far as i can tell , while the rest of the world is still stuck in a nearly government - only mode , @entity20 , with the support of the @entity46 administration , is letting loose the creativity of @entity6 know - how			1
beginning with the @entity60 competition , continuing with the @entity61 ( cargo ) and now the @entity64 selection , @entity20 " bet the farm " on commercial companies filling the gap left by the retirement of the space shuttle , with the @entity55 companies ( @entity3 and @entity2 ) replacing the @entity56 in bringing @entity20 astronauts to the @entity58 will allow @entity20 to invest the savings in deep space capabilities such as @entity67 and @entity68			1
i believe it is critical that both commercial cargo and crew succeed for at least two reasons : first , @entity20 's proper role can be summed up in three words : " @entity75			0
" it is time for @entity20 to turn over the low @entity78 orbit work to industry while @entity20 focuses on getting humanity to @entity81 , following in the tracks of robotic rovers @entity84			0
second , history teaches us that without a trailing edge of commercial exploitation and profitability , exploration as large scale , routine human endeavor will not succeed			0
as an aerospace professional and former @entity20 executive , i have encountered over the decades many concepts for private space exploration			2
until a few years ago , none of these ideas met the sniff test for what i call the " practical visionary , " that is , someone capable of seeing a new future , yet solidly grounded in lessons learned			0
something was always missing in these early ventures -- either the technical approach required some " unobtanium " technology to be invented , the advocate had good ideas but no money or the " build it and they will come " philosophy showed total @entity115 © in business and marketing			0
today 's selection points us in a different direction			0
as with the early 20th century airmail routes that helped stimulate aviation , @entity20 's commercial programs are now the anchor tenants in the government transfer of space services to the private sector			2
this in turn will enable a robust new business enterprise and allow @entity20 to focus on @entity81 -- the ultimate target for exploration .			2

@entity133 says recent moves by @entity20 will allow it to focus on deep space
@entity133 : @entity3 , @entity2 contracts are secret weapons in space race with @entity39
new arrangement will let " loose the creativity of @entity6 know - how , " he says
