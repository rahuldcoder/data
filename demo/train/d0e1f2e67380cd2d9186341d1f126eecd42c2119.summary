the @entity17 selected 60 pieces of evidence the @entity19 had in storage for use in terror trials , including huge pieces of an airplane that survived ramming into the @entity14 towers			1
" i think the most powerful pieces here are the most personal , " said @entity39 , director of exhibit development at the @entity17			1
" the things that people put in their pockets that morning not knowing that this was going to be a day that changed their lives forever			2
" perhaps the most heart - wrenching items on display belonged to @entity51 of @entity52 , @entity53			1
@entity51 was taking her 4 - year - old daughter , @entity54 , to visit @entity55			2
they were aboard @entity57 , which was the second plane to hit the @entity14			1
@entity51 's wallet was found in the debris , battered but still intact			2
it 's on display along with three credit cards			2
a picture of @entity51 and @entity54 at the beach is also shown			2
" a lot of family members want to make sure there are public displays because they do n't want people to forget what they lost that day , " said @entity65 , a @entity17 senior vice president			1
a sampling of the many cell phones and pagers are part of the exhibit			1
" it 's so sad because the families , the colleagues of the people who were in the @entity14 did n't give up , " @entity77 said			0
" they kept trying to call , and call , and call again with just a glimmer of hope that somehow perhaps the people were still buried underneath the rubble or had perhaps been taken to a hospital			0
it was very emotional for the rescue workers because they could hear the cell phones ringing			1
" pictures of the 19 hijackers are also on display along with some of their passports			2
a seating plan for one of the flights shows where leader @entity99 and his co-conspirators were sitting , and a letter all the hijackers left behind is included			2

a translation of the first page is shown and begins with the chilling words : " the last night : 1 ) embrace the will to die and renew allegiance			0
" @entity39 said @entity17 staff interviewed dozens of @entity19 agents , journalists and experts on the 9/11 attacks to provide a full picture of what happened that day and the @entity19 investigation that followed			1
" the story was not only the investigation , but also how it changed the @entity19 forever , " @entity39 said			1
" the big priority after 9/11 was stop the next attack			0
" @entity121 , a @entity19 public affairs person who worked with the @entity17 on the project , agrees			1
" there 's a theme in the stories of how the @entity19 's changed			1
we 're more of a national security organization , threat - based intelligence , " he said			0
" and we want to prevent			0
and the way you prevent is you got to predict			0
so now that is our mindset			0
" a key terror plot also shown involves @entity135 citizen @entity134 , known as the shoe bomber			1
@entity134 got on board a flight from @entity139 headed to @entity140 just days before @entity141 in 2001			0

tourists will be able to see his shoes , the clothes he was wearing , the matches he used and the remains of drugs used to sedate him after he was caught			0
people will also be able to see several heavy leather belts passengers and crew members used to fashion restraints for the powerfully built , 6 - foot , 4 - inch @entity134			0
@entity121 pointed to the @entity134 case as something that showed @entity161 was able to change tactics by using a single operative with a bomb instead of teams , which were used in the 9/11 attacks			0
