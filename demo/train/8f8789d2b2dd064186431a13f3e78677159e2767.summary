@entity0 -- lawyers for @entity7 editor - in - chief @entity6 have filed an appeal against his extradition to @entity10 to face questioning on sex charges , a member of his defense team said thursday			1
the appeal was submitted to @entity0 's @entity14 on tuesday , but lawyers do not expect the case to be heard for another two or three months , said @entity17 , who is part of @entity6 's defense team			1
a judge at @entity21 ruled on february 24 that @entity6 should be extradited from the @entity22 to @entity10 to face allegations of sex crimes			1
he says the charges are an attempt to smear him			0
the case is not related to the work of @entity6 's website , which facilitates the publication of secret information			1
it made headlines last year for leaking documents and videos related to the wars in @entity38 and @entity39 , and thousands of @entity41 diplomatic cables			0
at a news conference after the judge 's extradition ruling last month , he lashed out at the decision			2
he said to thrust someone into a foreign land where someone does not speak the language or understand the judicial system " is a very grave matter			0
" @entity6 has not been charged with a crime , but @entity10 prosecutors want to question him in connection with sexual misconduct allegations related to separate incidents in august			1
his attorneys are fighting his extradition on procedural and human - rights grounds			0
judge @entity62 , however , dismissed almost all the arguments by the defense			0
he ruled that the allegations against @entity6 are extraditable offenses			2
he disagreed with @entity6 's lawyers that @entity10 prosecutor @entity68 did not have the authority to issue a @entity71 arrest warrant and ruled that the warrant was valid			1
@entity62 also tossed out claims that @entity6 would not be able to obtain a fair trial in @entity10 or that @entity10 prosecutors had not made any effort to promptly interview @entity6 before he left @entity10 last year			2
" in fact this is untrue , " the judge said in the ruling			0
he said @entity6 's @entity10 lawyer @entity80 had made a " deliberate attempt to mislead the court " and that it was @entity6 who had avoided interrogation before he left @entity10			1
" it would be a reasonable assumption from the facts that mr. @entity6 was deliberately avoiding interrogation before he left @entity10 , " @entity62 wrote			2
@entity6 's lawyers have raised the possibility that @entity10 would hand him over to the @entity41 if @entity22 extradites him to @entity10			1
prosecutor @entity90 , representing @entity10 , has dismissed that claim			0
@entity1 's @entity92 and @entity93 contributed to this report .			0
