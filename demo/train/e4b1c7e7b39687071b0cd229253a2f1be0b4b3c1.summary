-- @entity2 pace bowler @entity1 ripped through @entity4 's batsmen on the third day of the first cricket test in @entity6 , taking eight wickets as the hosts were forced to follow on			1
@entity1 took a career - best 7 - 51 as @entity4 , resuming on 25 - 0 overnight , were skittled for just 233 to concede a massive first - innings deficit of 325 runs			1
the 26 - year - old , whose previous best figures were 6 - 49 , then took the wicket of first - innings centurion @entity14 as @entity4 reached 66 - 2 at stumps on monday			1
the haul took @entity1 to 193 wickets in his 37th test and gave @entity2 a great chance of winning the two - match series against a side who usurped their no. 1 ranking in the five - day format late last year			1
he claimed five wickets in less than four overs after tea as @entity4 collapsed from 221 - 4			2
" we actually had the ball changed when we came out after tea because the seam had popped open on the old one , " @entity1 told reporters			0
" we hoped to get a bit of reverse swing -- it worked in our favor			0
" @entity1 's strike partner @entity38 set the tone when he had @entity40 caught by wicketkeeper @entity41 with his first delivery of the day , with the opener not adding to his overnight score of 12			2
@entity1 then bowled @entity45 for four as the no. 3 failed to play a stroke , and he took the vital wicket of @entity48 , the highest run - scorer in @entity50 history , when he tempted the veteran to edge a drive to @entity41 for just seven			0
the belligerent @entity14 then added 136 with debutant @entity53 as he smashed his 18th @entity50 ton before giving away his wicket to @entity56 with an easy catch to @entity58 deep in the cover field			0
@entity14 hit 15 boundaries in 139 deliveries -- the same amount that the 29 - year - old @entity53 faced in making 56 , who took @entity4 safely to tea along with captain @entity65			2
but @entity65 fell to left - arm spinner @entity66 in the first over of the final session , and @entity1 had @entity53 caught at midwicket before running through the tail			0
@entity72 captain @entity71 made the @entity74 bat again , despite @entity41 not being able to take the field due to a back injury			0
@entity38 again accounted for @entity40 as the opener misjudged an inswinger and had his castle wrecked after shouldering arms , and @entity1 had @entity14 caught by @entity71 at slip for 16			2
@entity45 ( 27 ) and @entity48 ( 15 ) added 44 in the remainder of the 23 overs scheduled to be bowled before stumps , but will face a massive task to prevent @entity4 going 1 - 0 down in the series			1
meanwhile , @entity87 took an unassailable 2 - 0 lead in the one - day series against visiting @entity90 , winning the second match by five wickets in @entity93 on monday			1
the tourists managed only 183 - 8 in their 50 overs as @entity96 top - scored with 86 , and the @entity97 reached their target from only 27.3 overs with @entity100 smashing 78 off in a 52 - ball innings featuring five sixes .			0
