-- the protests that have spread through parts of the @entity4 world led to dramatic change in another country tuesday , as @entity8 's king dismissed his government			1
@entity10 made the decision following protests in recent weeks in which several thousand people demanded economic and political reforms			0
experts on the region said tuesday @entity10 's decision was aimed at warding off larger - scale demonstrations in the wake of the huge protests in @entity21 and @entity22			1
the @entity21 protests , which began the movement , toppled that country 's government			1
in @entity22 , president @entity27 has fired his cabinet , but protesters in massive demonstrations continue to call for his ouster			0
the protests -- which have also caught on to various extents in @entity34 , @entity35 , and @entity36 -- have proved to be " a real watershed event for the @entity4 world , " said @entity38 , managing editor of @entity39			1
" it 's really unprecedented			1
" there was a series of protests in @entity4 nations in the 1950s , but those were prompted by an ideology of @entity47 in a post-colonial world , said @entity49 , with the @entity50			0
a 2005 uprising in @entity52 was about independence and ousting @entity54			0
while it was successful , the revolution 's message was not one that other nations associated with , he said			1
" it 's different this time			1
people are standing up for their economic rights , their dignity			0
it 's very different , " said @entity49			2
@entity66 of the @entity67 said there 's a whole new mind - set			1
" the @entity21 uprising has caused change in the attitude and behavior of ordinary @entity4 citizens -- and today we are witnessing the emergence of a can - do nation attitude , " he explained			1
economic concerns have fueled the protests across the region			0
at a speech tuesday in @entity82 , @entity83 , managing director of the @entity84 , said the need for action against unemployment was " a strong undercurrent of the political turmoil in @entity21 , and of rising social strains in other countries , " according to his prepared remarks			0
@entity4 leaders have been getting the message , @entity49 said , noting an article in the @entity97 in which @entity54 president @entity98 said leaders must " see the need of reform " before protests like those in @entity22 and @entity21 break out , because by then " it 's too late to do any reform			2
" @entity10 's decision and @entity98 's remarks " are preventive moves , " said @entity49			2
@entity38 noted that the @entity8 king has sacked his government before in recent years			1
" but in the context of what 's happening now , it 's going to be seen as a way to get ahead of these protests			2
" when the @entity21 protests proved successful at first , many analysts still doubted a " domino theory " would play out through the @entity118 , said @entity49 , because each nation has a different structure , population , and set of challenges			2
but " right now , it seems like it 's a possibility			2
so i think governments are trying to prevent what could be copycat movements in the region			0
" the level of solidarity in the @entity4 world has come as a surprise to some experts , said @entity137			2
but " it 's a matter of psychology at this point			2
people feel that there is an overture , and they want to push , want to do it			0
" still , there are key differences			0
" i still think that monarchies have an edge in terms of legitimacy , " @entity49 said			0
@entity21 , @entity22 , and @entity35 are officially republics , and leaders were gearing up for successions by bringing their children to power , sparking fury and frustration in an underserved population			0
in @entity162 state monarchies , such as @entity8 and @entity163 , uprisings that threaten the government are " less likely , " said @entity38			1
" but i would n't rule it out			0
" the @entity165 views @entity22 , @entity8 , and @entity163 as key allies in the region			1
the @entity163 kingdom has been stable for decades			0
" if @entity163 starts to see popular protests , " said @entity38 , " then you 're really going to see people in @entity173 freak out			1
" it remains unclear how far the change in any of these countries might go			0
in @entity8 , whether the king will regain support from protesters by dismissing his government is " a million dollar question , " said @entity38 .			1

new : analyst : a " can - do nation attitude " is emerging
whether @entity8 's king will gain support is a " million dollar question "
" it 's really unprecedented , " @entity38 says
