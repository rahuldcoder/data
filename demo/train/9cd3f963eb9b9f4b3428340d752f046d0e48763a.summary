-- i hate the @entity2			1
no , i do n't dislike them			0
i flat out can not stand anything about the @entity2			1
the year they went 1 - 15 , i was ticked they won that one game			0
when they played in those three @entity9 in the ' 90s , i rooted hard for the opposition			0
hell , i hate them more than the @entity13 ! that 's why i take great pleasure in seeing the transfer of power in the @entity18 , where the football greatness has moved from @entity20 to @entity21			1
for decades , all of the talk has been about the @entity2 , that damn star , and lately , the monstrosity of a football palace built by owner @entity27			1
but with the @entity32 playoffs kicking off this weekend , the only football they 'll witness at @entity30 is @entity33 and @entity34 in the @entity35			0
another opinion : why the @entity2 still rule in @entity18 but 250 miles south of @entity20 , the @entity37 will take on the @entity38 in the @entity40 wild card game			1
for @entity2 fans , it 's over			2
no longer can you talk supremacy over @entity21			2
the expansion @entity37 is the talk of the state , and all the @entity2 fans can do is complain about @entity48 and @entity27			1
and they might as well get used to it			0
the @entity2 are truly a has - been team			1
those five @entity51 trophies ? well , you better keep watching @entity53			0
that will be the only way to see @entity20 raise that again			2
the @entity37 are a young and talented team that could have done better than 10 - 6 had we not been hit with injuries to our top three players			1
we are about to see a tremendous run by the @entity37 , and when it comes to pro football in the state , no one will be talking about the bumbling @entity2			1
@entity64 ? hell , you 're barely @entity66 's team with the rise of the @entity68 in back - to - back @entity69			0
you do n't even have the best - looking cheerleaders in the @entity32 ( i 'll vote for the @entity73 )			0
@entity21 has always been a world - class city , and one satisfied with being a @entity18 town			2
@entity20 ? it 's always desired to be another @entity77 and @entity78			0
just get your own identity and stick with it			0
sure , @entity20 will talk a lot of smack about being the @entity37 ' big brother , and before that , the @entity84			1
but i do n't care			0
i was a " @entity87 " fan before @entity88 bolted to @entity89 , and now i 'm a season ticket holder for the @entity37			2
i would continue , but i need to pack for my flight friday to @entity21 for the game			0
all the @entity2 fans will be packing is a bunch of @entity95 for the new @entity96 in @entity18 : the @entity37 .			1

@entity98 says he ca n't stand the @entity2
the @entity37 fan says " football greatness has moved from @entity20 to @entity21 "
@entity98 : " the @entity2 are truly a has - been team "
