-- when the @entity1 , back in march , made the unexpected announcement that this month 's @entity3 , long planned to take place in @entity5 , was being moved to @entity6 , the reasons given were bland : @entity6 was taking over from @entity5 " to facilitate a free - flowing discussion with our close @entity10 partners , " the @entity1 announced			1
president @entity12 was said to believe that @entity6 was a more intimate setting for the world leaders to get together			1
there was immediate conversation about the explanation			0
past @entity10 summits have been known to attract protests that culminated in violence in the streets of the cities where they have been held			0
@entity6 -- the presidential retreat in @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 -- is about as secure a sealed - off location as exists in this country			1
no one gets near it who is not supposed to get near it			0
originally the @entity5 g - 8 summit was supposed to be immediately followed in @entity5 by a separate summit of the leaders of @entity38 nations			1
the @entity38 meeting is still scheduled for @entity5 ; like the g - 8 meeting , it will be hosted by @entity12			1
demonstrations are planned , and heavy security will be in place with the intention of keeping protesters well away from where the @entity38 leaders are convening			1
increasingly , over the years , cities that engage in grand talk about " bringing the world " to see their many civic and cultural attributes end up going into a defensive crouch at the same time they are welcoming their global visitors			0
it 's the only wise course ; we live in an age where terrorists know that the bigger the stage , the greater the opportunity for maximum impact			2
and in these jittery times , any occasion when a specific city becomes an enormous public stage , it also becomes a presumed potential target			0
there is an intake of breath that starts before the event commences , and that is not let out until after it concludes			0
in @entity77 , site of this summer 's @entity76 , there have been reports of plans for surface - to - air missiles to be installed as protective measures right in the city , including on the roofs of apartment buildings			2
hardly the symbol of a joyous and carefree gathering of the planet 's finest young athletes -- but , then , the planet has proved itself to be an often dangerous place , so discus throwers , twirling gymnasts and powerful missiles may have to share the setting			1
faster , higher , stronger -- the athletes , and the weapons in place to keep them safe			2
if the @entity3 in the isolated and wooded hills of @entity27 comes off as a model of protected tranquility , and is followed by messy scenes of street disorder at the @entity38 summit in @entity5 , it will not be surprising if @entity6 , which already has a long history of hosting distinguished guests of presidents , becomes the prototype for future top - level gatherings around the world as well as at home			1
and if that takes place , it will not be as big a shift as it superficially will seem			2
when the president visits troops in perilous areas overseas , he is described as " going into a war zone			2
" but in fact , anywhere in the @entity123 where a president travels these days receives war - zone security treatment			1
on television , a presidential meeting with dignitaries in a city away from @entity129 appears to take place in sedate , often elegant , rooms			1
but behind the camera shot -- outside the buildings where a president and his guests are meeting -- is security befitting preparedness for an imminent attack			1
concrete barriers , war wagons filled with security personnel with automatic weapons at the ready , human ring after human ring of law enforcement assigned to keep all unauthorized persons away ... the heart of any city where a modern - era president passes through is routinely turned into a temporary militarized bunker			1
as early as 1968 , when political violence stained the year , people were predicting that future presidential campaigns might be conducted solely from television studios			2
some said this would never happen ; security fears aside , the public would never allow its leaders to speak to them from such a sterile and locked - off environment			2
yet , in a backhanded way , it has turned out to be true			0
the television studio has become the moving impermeable bubble where a president resides when he is out in the nation			0
@entity6 , a bucolic federal campsite turned into a presidential retreat by @entity170 , who called it @entity171 , was renamed by president @entity172 in honor of his grandson			1
it was widely seen as a way for presidents to get some peace and quiet , away from the tension and tumult of their daily world			0
to dress and act casually , free from staring eyes			0
few people , of course , have firsthand knowledge of what it is like there			0
@entity188 summed up the feeling in his autobiography : " the president 's home at @entity6 , called @entity194 , is a beautiful rustic house with beamed ceilings , wood - paneled walls ... @entity197 and i experienced a sense of liberation at @entity6 that we never found in @entity129			1
because the perimeter was guarded , we could just open a door and take a walk			0
that 's a freedom , incidentally , that you do n't fully appreciate until you 've lost it			0
" foreign dignitaries came to call on presidents there , in a less formal , more relaxed setting than official @entity129			0
while most @entity123 can envision the @entity1 , they never have really seen , in full , @entity6			1
you ca n't tour the place , or even look at it from outside			0
there have been references to it in popular entertainment : the 1965 @entity220 political thriller novel , " night of @entity6 " ; the scene in the 1995 motion picture " @entity223 " in which @entity225 , as a widower president , sits with the woman he is falling in love with , played by @entity229 , watching television in his ( movie - set ) camp david cabin			1
there is a subtle difference at play in the way the @entity3 at @entity6 is being regarded			1
it 's not so much that the president and his guests want to get away from the world			1
it 's that a way needed to be found to keep the world away from them			0
will that turn out to be the way of the future ? with the possible exception of the @entity248 at @entity249 , @entity250 , there is perhaps no other place in the country designed so determinedly for absolute privacy			0
( from the official description of @entity249 provided by the @entity255 : " no visitors are permitted , and no exceptions are made			0
" ) whatever else happens at the @entity3 , that thought , and its implications , are what may endure			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity263 .			2

president @entity12 has moved this month 's @entity3 from @entity5 to @entity6
@entity263 says the presidential retreat is much more secure and isolated
he says a security *cordon* *envelops* presidents wherever they go
@entity263 : still , a place like @entity6 affords much more security
