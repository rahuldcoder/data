-- it 's been a big year for @entity3 's airline industry			2
in june , the country 's flag carrier lan completed its takeover of @entity8 's biggest airline @entity7			1
in recent weeks the aptly named merged group , @entity9 , has welcomed the continent 's first ever dreamliner 787 to its runways			2
another one is due to touchdown before the end of 2012 - and a further 30 will arrive within the next ten years			0
the $ 4.9 billion order represents one of the largest investments in @entity4 's history			1
@entity9 's ceo @entity18 says it will make a big difference to the firm 's growth strategy and hopes to get commercial flights running as soon as possible			1
" @entity24 is going to start flying as of two weeks from now to @entity25 , just to train pilots , " he told @entity0 's @entity23			1
" once they are trained they will start flying to @entity29 and after that initial phase of two months , there will be aircraft for @entity33			1
they will fly @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37			0
" despite the formation of the @entity9 , @entity4 and @entity7 will continue to operate as separate entities for the time being			1
the new @entity41 will fly under the @entity4 branding , as its parent group is keen to capitalize on the weight of the individual brands in their respective regional markets			1
" when you integrate companies which are as big as @entity4 and @entity7 , there are so many opportunities and so much money in terms of pursuing things			1
you have to have a very clear head in term of what not to do			0
" we do n't see right now a value to the customer in integrating the brands - we have two wonderful brands			1
@entity7 is highly valued in @entity8 and abroad and @entity4 is a household name in @entity64			1
it 's a wonderful problem to have			2
" despite the global downturn , @entity9 's main goal is growth through its existing route network domestically , regionally and internationally			2
mr @entity18 added : " in the last few years our planes are filled much more on the @entity64 end than on the developed markets end			0
we are feeling that slow down of the economy			0
" but we are @entity74			2
we lived with ups and downs for years , so this is far from scary for us			0
" with a significant number of @entity41 already ordered , there are obviously no plans by @entity9 to take it one plane at a time			0
and mr @entity18 has spoken of his hopes to buy even more of the aircraft , thanks to an increased balanced sheet provided by the recent merger			2
" our financial strengths will be increased by having a larger operation , " he said			0
" we will be able to buy more of these planes in very good financial conditions , which have also been traditional advantages of these companies			0
" as i said we increase our ability to fly to more places because of traffic rights , so there is a bunch of opportunities that open for us as a result of the integration			0
" a key decision that has n't been made since june 's merger , is which air alliance @entity9 will be joining			1
there are two options to choose from , @entity7 's current deal with @entity107 -- or , more likely , @entity109 's agreement with @entity110			1
mr @entity18 says he wo n't be pushed on giving an answer and no concrete decision has yet been made			2
" we are not sure yet			0
for a company like @entity9 , with such a leadership in the region , remaining unaligned is definitely an option , " he added			0
" we will give you a call right after we make the choice			0

@entity122 's first @entity121 to start flights within two months
@entity4 and @entity7 will continue to operate as separate brands despite merger
ceo says @entity74 ' are n't scared ' of economic downturn
