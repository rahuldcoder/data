-- @entity1 announced that she 's going to sing in space			1
everyone is raving about " gravity , " the new movie starring @entity6 and @entity7 as astronauts in orbit			0
and @entity10 just launched its first @entity12 mission on thursday			1
clearly , we @entity13 are still madly in love with space			0
but what about the moon ? it 's sad how far @entity20 has fallen in our space aspirations			1
so far that we ca n't even get into @entity23 orbit without help from the @entity25 , let alone get back to the moon			1
but @entity26 is trying to get back in the game			1
two months after launch , its @entity28 -- @entity28 , pronounced " laddie " -- has finished its looping journey and it is gathering important information about the moon 's dust and thin atmosphere			1
already , this modular spacecraft has tested a new system for interplanetary communication using pulsed lasers , delivering a blistering 622 megabits per second			0
try getting that from your internet service provider			0
@entity28 is a worthy mission , but it 's a far cry from the romance and ambition of space exploration 50 years ago			1
when @entity49 released a swing version of " @entity51 " in 1964 , the song captured the optimism of the @entity20 space program			1
president @entity54 had challenged the country to a manned moon landing three years earlier and @entity26 's budget rose by a factor of five to accomplish the goal			1
the moon landings were a phenomenal achievement			1
even knowing that they were motivated by a rivalry with the @entity64 and fueled by an unsustainable budget did n't tarnish their luster			0
the @entity68 was the largest and most powerful rocket ever built , and the @entity70 was the most technically complex human undertaking in history			0
two dozen brave and daring astronauts reached their target with computer processors less powerful than those inside our modern - day smartphones			0
the 12 who loped across the lunar soil are the only people to set foot on another world			0
today , the @entity70 shots fade and flicker in the public consciousness , like the grainy black - and - white tv images that many of us recall from just over 44 years ago			1
about 6 % of the @entity20 public thought the moon landings were a hoax , despite high resolution images that show the landers and tracks left by the rovers , and ongoing scientific experiments using the hardware we left behind			1
i used to get annoyed at the @entity70 deniers			0
( @entity100 at least managed to get even ; @entity102 videos where he decks conspiracy theorist and filmmaker @entity104 have been watched more than half a million times )			0
then i realized that a list of things that one in 10 @entity20 believes would include some pretty outrageous things			1
but willful cultural ignorance is sad			2
new players are stepping into the vacuum			0
@entity112 announced the @entity113 in 2007 , riffing off the successful @entity114 , where private teams were challenged to build a reusable spacecraft to reach the boundary of outer space			2
a $ 20 million prize will go to the first team to land a robot on the moon that can travel 500 meters and transmit images and video			2
twenty teams are still in the running			0
the competition expires when all the prizes have been claimed or at the end of 2015 , whichever comes first			0
@entity130 is likely to beat all these teams to the punch			0
a few weeks ago the @entity130 announced that the @entity134 lunar rover will be launched by the end of the year			2
if successful , it would be the first soft landing on the moon since the @entity25 @entity139 in 1976			2
less than a decade old , @entity130 's space program is well - funded and aggressive			2
@entity130 has put 15 astronauts in orbit and plans to complete a 60 - ton space station by 2020			0
following @entity134 , they plan sample return by 2020 and a manned landing by 2025			0
so , more than half a century after @entity146 left the last human footprint on the moon , the next may be made by someone who speaks @entity150			2
meanwhile , other countries are getting into the act			2
the @entity153 has long - term plans to send robots and astronauts to the moon			2
@entity157 and @entity10 also have advanced plans for lunar rovers			0
the @entity20 led the world in space but @entity26 is cooling its heels , with a vision that has shrunk along with its budget			1
@entity20 's space program would be best served by continuing the mission started 50 years ago			1
the moon still has much to teach us about how the solar system and the @entity23 formed			1
it 's not the sterile place we once thought ; there 's enough water and oxygen in the soil to easily sustain a base			2
it 's the perfect place for learning how to live and work beyond the @entity23			0
when @entity49 performed " @entity51 " on his tv show in 1969 he dedicated it to the @entity70 astronauts " who made the impossible possible			0
" @entity28 was designed to characterize the lunar environment in preparation for future human missions			1
but the @entity186 that would have gotten us back to the @entity188 was canceled in 2010			0
@entity28 will set the table but no one 's coming to dinner			1
by partnering with other countries or private sector companies , @entity26 can rekindle the dream and fulfill our destiny to explore beyond our planet			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			1

@entity199 : it 's sad how far @entity20 has fallen in our moon aspirations
@entity199 : @entity26 is trying to get back in the game with the launch of @entity28
he says other countries and private companies are more ambitious in exploring
@entity199 : the moon has much to teach us , let 's continue the mission started 50 years ago
