editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity20 region of @entity21 ( @entity9 ) -- earlier this fall			1
@entity9 went to the @entity20 region of the @entity21 to hang out with indigenous cowboys of the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) tribe			1
these riders were all from the @entity27 -- a bronc - riding , bull - riding and barrel - racing league catering to the @entity31 community of the @entity32			1
given the difficult economic circumstances under which most of these cowboys and their families live , it 's an unusual portrait of @entity38 in the 21st century			1
early this year , it was reported that more than 56 percent of @entity25 live below the poverty line , one of the highest rates in the @entity21 , even among the traditionally marginalized indigenous communities			1
add to that a frightening unemployment rate climbing above 50 percent -- disconcertingly higher than the national rate , which hovers around 9.5 percent -- and the picture is extremely bleak			0
many of these families throughout @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 also lack electricity , running water or telephones			0
still , theirs is a spiritually rich culture , based on family - operated , small - scale farming and ranching			0
though the professional rodeo circuit offers a slight opportunity for some of the best riders , by and large members of this community are relegated to the @entity25 league			1
the best many can hope for is a berth at the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , each year			0
the winnings are not high and neither is the exposure compared with many of the larger stadium rodeo events			2
@entity27 , like several other rodeo associations , provides young riders with an opportunity to sign up and compete against each other from march to november each year			2
the cost to enter can be high , and if you do n't win , you have to find a way home , struggle to get back in the circuit in upcoming weeks and somehow find the resources to feed the livestock that await back home			0
the @entity25 riders have managed to get a degree of mainstream exposure over the years , mostly because bull and bronc riding are becoming a big - buck industry elsewhere in the @entity21 over the course of a week , we tailed several of the group 's riders all across the region , accompanying them during training and traveling with them to and from assorted events			1
over that time , we came to know their families , witnessing as they coped with personal struggles and sharing in occasional successes			0
for more on this story , head to the @entity9 site .			2
