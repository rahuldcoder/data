-- " they tried to forget us , as if we never even lived there , " says circassian architect @entity2			2
now 67 years old , @entity2 speaks about the pain he feels when thinking of the 2014 @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , and how the opening ceremony failed to mention the history of the circassian people who once called @entity7 their capital			1
circassian artist @entity14 , 32 , says far from being a source of pride , the @entity13 are a tragic reminder of what was lost during the @entity19 that ended in 1864			2
" it was our land , " he says , " but during the opening of the @entity6 , they said it was a @entity25 land , and then after that it was @entity8 land			1
they did n't say anything about the @entity30 part of @entity8 history			1
" and even more egregious than failing to be recognized , say some @entity30 activists , is that the @entity6 venue at @entity35 was built on what they say is the mass burial site of the @entity30 ' final defeat			1
in these @entity6 , " athletes are skiing on the bones of our ancestors , " one activist says , adding : " it would be like @entity41 deciding to build an @entity42 on @entity43			1
" circassian historian @entity48 says the international attention on @entity7 as the host city of the @entity53 has awakened a movement to push the @entity8 government to officially recognize what he and others say was the @entity30 genocide of 1864			1
the @entity30 lived in @entity7 for millennia , says @entity60 , a research fellow at @entity62 's @entity61 in @entity63			1
in the 19th century , @entity8 coveted their land -- which is south and east of @entity8 proper -- and brutally defeated them , decimating entire tribes , he says			1
@entity8 killed around 1.5 million @entity30 and expelled a similar number			1
@entity8 president @entity70 , who personally lobbied for @entity7 to host the @entity53 , has repeatedly urged observers to avoid mixing politics with sport			1
but activists say the effort to draw attention to their cause has come at a price			0
they point to what they say are campaigns of intimidation and detention by @entity8 security forces in order to silence criticism			1
circassian activists say that on february 7 , dozens were detained in the city of @entity89 while trying to peacefully protest the start of the @entity6			1
in @entity96 , the capital of the @entity95 region , about 150 miles north of @entity7 , @entity92 's sand art exhibit paints a tale of a 101 - year - long war and the tragic exodus that he says is in danger of being forgotten			1
the @entity8 conquest of the @entity103 is widely documented in @entity8 literature and history , yet @entity30 say their portion of this history -- a story of crushing defeat , widespread killing , and mass deportation to the @entity112 and elsewhere -- is strangely absent from @entity8 history books			1
@entity14 says that as a child growing up in @entity8 , he knew very little about his ancestry			2
learning @entity30 history was prohibited in school , he says			1
" when i was a child , it was if i was a guest in my own country			0
but slowly , i found some information about our history , and now i understand			0
" " i started to think about it			0
it 's like there was a hole in my heart , and now i want it to be filled			0
" when asked if he worries about angering the @entity8 government with his art , he admits there is some risk but adds that it is his duty to show younger generations , like his , what really happened in the @entity103 150 years ago			2
" i want to show the truth , " he says			0
" because some young people , people who live here , they do n't know about their own history			2
" an attempt to preserve culture circassian activists point out that there were efforts to preserve parts of their culture when the area was part of the @entity149			2
to this day , there is an autonomous region not far from @entity7 reserved for the @entity95 , a subset of the circassian people			1
in @entity96 , the circassian language is spoken on the street and shares a place next to @entity8 on historic landmarks			1
last year , workers constructed a monument to the circassian people in a scruffy park next to a mosque that was built in the 1990s			0
but the monument is still unfinished , its designer pointed out			0
it lacks a dozen bronze stars as well as lights to illuminate it at night			0
meanwhile , in the @entity42 in @entity7 , authorities had authorized the establishment of an @entity95 cultural exhibit			2
but @entity172 , leader of a @entity30 council in @entity96 , says @entity8 @entity6 organizers refused a number of specific requests , including the movement of the remains of those lost in the battle at @entity35 to a separate cemetery and the creation of a special museum to house precious artifacts that would be recovered during that resettlement			1
@entity172 says those requests were denied , and instead of preserving the graves , construction crews desecrated many of them during the creation of the @entity6 ski venue there			2
@entity172 says they also asked for a portion of the cultural program in the @entity6 opening ceremony to acknowledge the @entity30 chapter of @entity8 history			1
and he was hopeful they would honor that request			0
" we believed the @entity6 tradition would be observed here ... until the very last minute , " he says			2
" and that too did not happen			0
" but even with the heartache @entity172 says the circassian people feel now as a result of these @entity6 , he goes on to say that " @entity30 are no enemies of @entity8			1
ever since @entity207 , @entity30 have helped with the development of @entity8			1
" " we consider ourselves citizens of @entity8 , but we would like adequate respect for our culture , " he adds			2
it is a sentiment shared by @entity14			0
" i do n't hate @entity8 , " he says			1
" my wife is @entity8			2
i do not want this war to be repeated			0
i do want us to have our land , but i understand that is impossible			0
i do n't want blood			0
i do n't want wars			0
and that is why it is so complicated			0
" " i want to show people what really happened			0
it 's a big tragedy for us , for our people			0
we lost land , we lost a thousand million people			0
that 's why we ca n't forget			0
" @entity230 contributed to this report .			0
