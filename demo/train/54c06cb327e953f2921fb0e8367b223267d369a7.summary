the @entity0 has taken over much of the @entity2 province of @entity3 , including the country 's second largest city , @entity6			1
in the course of doing so , they have released thousands of jihadist prisoners , reportedly taken hundreds of people hostage and -- perhaps most worryingly of all -- fortified their already strong territorial position in the region			0
the group has made impressive gains in the last year			0
besides this week 's achievements , isis have come to dominate the international media discourse on the war in @entity18 and wrested control of the city of @entity21 , which , astonishingly , is less than an hour from @entity22			1
this , after all , is a group that was rejected by @entity26 because of its ferocity			1
its mysterious leaders are far beyond the extremist pale , and that they seem to be consolidating a territorial base must be put at the forefront of international counter-terrorism policy			0
@entity0 , currently led by @entity34 is an @entity26 offshoot and a spawn of @entity37 's @entity0 ( @entity0 )			1
for the @entity0 , the last few years have been rocky to say the least , but the unprecedented instability caused by the @entity18 civil war has given the group a new lease of life			2
since it was formed when @entity43 announced an unanticipated ( by all sides ) merger with @entity47 in april 2013 , @entity0 has gone from strength to strength			2
commentators on @entity18 often refer to @entity0 as the most radical of the myriad jihadist factions operating there			2
for some reason , though , coverage from @entity2 this week has stuck to calling them @entity56 " rebels , " " insurgents " or " militants			2
" these terms of reference are woefully unsuitable -- @entity0 fighters in @entity2 are of exactly the same inclination as those in @entity18 , who have repeatedly been called out for their unparalleled barbarity on -- and off -- the battlefield			1
this does n't just matter to @entity2 , though , it matters to the rest of the world as well			0
in the wider region , @entity0 's presence in @entity18 will continue to skew the fight against the @entity76 regime for the worse			1
after all , these " rebels " are fighting the same people as the @entity18 army			0
on an international level , any gains for @entity0 are particularly troubling because it is by far the most popular group for foreign fighters to join			1
this is because , more than anything else , their membership requirements are minimal -- far less , for example than those for @entity47			0
citizens from across the world who have been going to fight in @entity18 -- @entity93 and @entity94 included -- usually end up fighting alongside @entity0			1
@entity18 commentators and counter-terrorism experts alike have warned time and again of the threat posed by @entity0 returnees : if they are already extremists when they go out to @entity18 , what they are when they return is significantly more dangerous , not least because of the weapons training they receive			0
the @entity102 has also reported that foreign @entity0 fighters operate in single - nation battalions , something which equips them even better to bring the terrorist threat back home			0
the shooting in may at @entity110 ' @entity109 was probably the first instance of a returnee isis fighter committing a terrorist offence			0
it will most likely not be the last			0
a frequently - referenced study into foreign fighters in 1980s @entity115 concluded that about one in nine returnees went on to commit terrorism offences			0
that may not sound like much , but if one considers that there are an estimated 2,000 @entity125 citizens fighting in @entity18 now ( according to @entity126 , the @entity125 's law enforcement agency ) it becomes a far more troubling statistic			0
@entity18 aside , @entity0 's new dominance in northwestern @entity2 will be the principal destabiliser of the region			1
if left alone , @entity3 will become a jihadist 's playground , one that will welcome -- and train up -- any foreigner sympathetic to @entity0 's ideology			1
besides that , though , the world needs to act because of the terrible risk this runs for @entity2 's @entity142 population , a minority in @entity3 but still numbering in the thousands			1
@entity0 has a fetish for @entity147 sectarianism and is also reported to have targeted @entity148			1
they are certain to perpetrate many more horrific offences there if left unchallenged			0
the international community has a humanitarian and strategic prerogative to act against @entity0 's most recent gains in @entity2 ; the @entity2 government needs as much support as it can get in challenging @entity0			1
aside from a robust military response , @entity2 president @entity158 's government needs to challenge the jihadists ideologically			2
he needs to reach out to the disenfranchised @entity56 population , a group that has become marginalised economically and socially during his time in power , for this is the well from which most @entity0 fighters are drawn			0
taking a purely heavy - handed approach will just feed into the jihadist propaganda			0
encouragingly , @entity158 seemed receptive to such suggestions in march when he attended , alongside @entity172 representatives , @entity22 's first anti-terrorism conference			2
one thing is for sure , though , and that is that this is @entity2 's war now , and no one else 's			1

@entity0 ( @entity0 ) has taken over @entity2 's second largest city , @entity6
@entity185 of *anti-extremism* think tank @entity172 says *development* is worrying
" rejected by @entity26 because of its ferocity , " @entity0 " has a fetish for @entity147 sectarianism "
international community -- and @entity2 -- must act against @entity0 's gains , says @entity185
