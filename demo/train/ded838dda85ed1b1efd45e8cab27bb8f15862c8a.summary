@entity0 -- there is a quiet hum in the air			1
moments later , it 's clear why			2
@entity6 sweeps in , and it feels like a cool breeze has washed over the room despite the sweltering 100 - degree @entity11 summer heat outside			1
@entity6 still rocking out at 72 his apparel is basic but he exudes " rock star " -- strolling in wearing a pinstriped blazer , a t - shirt , dark jeans and sneakers			1
two silver pendants adorn his neck : the longer of the two is a signature peace sign ; the other , fashioned from a 45 lp adapter that was immediately given to him when he remarked to its former owner how much he liked it			2
such is @entity6 's charm			1
despite being accompanied by no fewer than 15 people , he is disarmingly self - deprecating and modest			2
@entity6 talks about his new album @entity6 , one of two living members of the @entity30 and winner of nine @entity32 , turned 72 on saturday			1
he spent his birthday with fans and fellow musicians at the @entity36 in @entity0			1
as he always does on his birthday , he celebrates a moment of peace and love at the stroke of noon , and encouraged everyone else to do the same			1
" wherever you are -- on a bus , in the office , in the studio , hanging out ... whatever you 're doing , at noon , just go , ' peace and love			1
' that 's all i ask for my birthday			2
" a vegetarian , he attributes his trim physique to @entity52 and a sensible diet			2
" i work out quite a lot , and you know , broccoli is my main course , stuff like that			0
so , you know , that 's how i do it			0
just keep yourself fit , " he says			0
" so as long as you do something physical , you know , keep moving			0
" @entity6 's life in pictures keep moving he does -- weaving through the crowd of well - wishers , family and friends with an easy affability			1
not surprisingly , security is tight			0
he nonetheless radiates warmth , shaking hands cordially with strangers and exchanging affectionate hugs with friends			0
and it 's quite a group of friends he has			0
fellow members of his ever - rotating @entity83 band are there in full force : @entity87 's @entity86 with his signature goatee ; music producer extraordinaire @entity89 and his instantly recognizable white - and - black mane ; a young - looking @entity92 from mr. @entity93 ; @entity96 's @entity95 sporting aviators			0
country star @entity97 , @entity98 from @entity100 - based @entity99 , @entity101 of @entity102 , and @entity103 are also on hand to pay tribute to the @entity107 icon			0
the @entity109 ' legendary @entity108 pops his head in during the interview , and jokingly says he 'll interrupt and take a seat on @entity6 's lap. @entity6 pretends to be aggrieved			1
" i have to let him in			0
he 's the brother - in - law			0
it 's a family thing ! " he 's referring to his wife of 31 years , @entity116 , whose sister @entity117 wed three years ago			0
outside the @entity119 , hundreds are thronging for the chance to get up close and personal with their idol			0
@entity123 traveled from @entity124 with her husband and two kids for this moment			0
" i just ca n't believe i 'm here , " she said			0
" this has just been my dream for so long to see a living @entity30 in person , and @entity6 is just the best ! " she admits it 's almost unbearably hot outside , but , " it 's worth it ! " one woman holds a sign that reads , " @entity6 , sign my son ! " another holds a sign that says , " you hugged me in 1964 , please do it again "			1
the crowd breaks into an excited chatter when @entity6 's inner circle lines up on the stage			1
when the man himself emerges from the restaurant , the screams and shouts crescendo			0
@entity6 is about to begin the countdown to shout " peace and love " at noon when out of nowhere a loud , monotonous tone begins to blare			1
@entity154 , @entity6 continues on , and as if listening to the intended message , the tone silences just in time as the count reaches " one			1
" " peace and love ! " everyone shouts in unison			2
to the delight of the crowd , @entity6 's friends and family , partly led by saxophonist @entity162 , begin to sing a @entity166 anthem			2
" all we are saying , is give peace a chance			2
" @entity6 sings the last line loudly into the microphone , waving both hands in the signature " peace " sign high in the air			1
the crowd watching is hugging , laughing and crying			0
happy 72nd birthday , @entity6 .			1
