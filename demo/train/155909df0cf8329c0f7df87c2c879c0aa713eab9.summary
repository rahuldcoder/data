-- four groups that advocate for immigrant rights said thursday they will challenge @entity5 's new immigration law , which allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal @entity10 residency			1
the @entity11 , the @entity12 , the @entity12 of @entity5 and the @entity13 held a news conference thursday in @entity15 to announce the legal challenge			1
" the @entity5 community can be assured that a vigorous and sophisticated legal challenge will be mounted , in advance of @entity22 's implementation , seeking to prevent this unconstitutional and discriminatory law from ever taking effect , " said @entity17 , president of the @entity11 , known as @entity11			1
" this law will only make the rampant racial profiling of @entity28 that is already going on in @entity5 much worse , " said @entity25 , executive director of the @entity12 of @entity5			1
" if this law were implemented , citizens would effectively have to carry ' their papers ' at all times to avoid arrest			2
it is a low point in modern @entity35 when a state law requires police to demand documents from people on the street			2
" @entity41 @entity5 gov. @entity41 signed the law last week			1
it goes into effect 90 days after the close of the legislative session , which has not been determined			0
@entity41 and others who support the law say it does not involve racial profiling or any other illegal acts			1
" racial profiling is illegal , " @entity41 said after signing the bill friday			1
" it is illegal in @entity35 , and it 's certainly illegal in @entity5			1
" the @entity56 said sunday it also planned legal action			2
" our churches and pastors in @entity5 are outraged about the significant threat this anti-immigrant law will have in the lives of @entity5 's latinos , " said the rev. @entity58 , the group 's chairman			1
" this policy violates the rights of @entity10 citizens , particularly the fast - growing @entity70 population of @entity5 , by eliminating the basic right of due process , which we are certain that the courts will agree , " @entity58 said			1
the law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they 're in the @entity10 illegally			2
the measure makes it a state crime to live or travel through @entity5 illegally			1
it also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them			2
in addition to signing the law , @entity41 also issued an executive order that requires training for local officers on how to implement the law without engaging in racial profiling or discrimination			1
" this training will include what does and does not constitute reasonable suspicion that a person is not legally present in the @entity10 , " she said			0
some officials in @entity5 have expressed their displeasure with the measure			1
@entity15 mayor @entity103 said thursday that he is " very disappointed			1
" he said he is concerned that calls to boycott @entity5 businesses and tourism will harm the state			1
" i 'm very incredulous that our state leaders -- our so - called leaders -- have allowed our state to be split when we 're suffering economic hardships , " @entity103 told @entity0			0
other critics say the bill is unconstitutional and will trample residents ' civil rights			0
" quite simply , this law is a civil rights disaster and an insult to @entity10 values , " said @entity116 , legal director of the @entity117			1
" no one in our country should be required to produce their ' papers ' or demand to prove their innocence			0
what kind of country are we becoming ? " but a national @entity132 leader said thursday that @entity5 is just filling a void left by the federal government			1
" i think the people of @entity5 have a right to pass their laws under the 10th amendment , " @entity136 minority leader @entity135 said			1
" i think it is clearly a result of the federal government 's failure to secure our border and to enforce our laws			0
" @entity103 said the real solution is comprehensive immigration reform that would allow more immigrants to legally enter the @entity10			0
" this law does n't accomplish that , " he said			1
" it does n't do anything on that			2
" president @entity156 has called on @entity157 to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law this year			2
@entity0 has learned that senate majority leader @entity159 and other top @entity161 senators will unveil the outlines of that legislation late thursday			0
but @entity135 said at a briefing thursday that " there 's not a chance " that @entity157 will approve the measure this year , especially after the recent passage of a health care reform bill			0
" i 've been out here for a little while and know that in the middle of an election year , after we 've had bills like health care shoved down our throats and the process twisted , tortured , pressured , bribed , you can not do a serious piece of legislation of this size , with this difficulty , in this environment , " he said			0
" and it 's nothing more than a cynical ploy to try and engage voters , some segment of voters , to show up in this november 's elections			0
" the @entity5 measure has drawn sharp criticism from the @entity195 government , which issued an advisory to its citizens this week			1
the secretary general of the @entity199 and some member states also expressed concerns about the law wednesday			2
" this is an issue of concern to all citizens of the @entity207 , beginning with the citizens of the @entity10 , a country with a very rich tradition of immigration and respect for immigrants who have come to lead a better life , " oas secretary general @entity203 said			0
" the rich tradition we all admire , of recognizing immigrants in the @entity10 , has been harmed , undermined			0
" the uproar caused by the law has even spread to the nation 's pastime			2
protesters plan to demonstrate against the @entity223 baseball team thursday outside @entity224 in @entity225 , @entity226			0
in @entity5 , two popular singers also will voice their opposition			2
@entity231 - winning @entity230 singer @entity229 is scheduled to meet with @entity103 on thursday evening			0
singer - songwriter @entity232 , an @entity5 native of @entity195 and @entity234 descent , also attended the thursday afternoon rally with the immigrant rights groups			1
" what gov. @entity41 signed into law last week is a piece of legislation that threatens the very heart of this great state , " @entity232 said			2
" we must come together and stop @entity22 from pitting neighbor against neighbor to the detriment of us all			0
" federal officials estimate there are about 10.8 million illegal immigrants in the @entity10 , of which about 6.6 million come from @entity195 and 760,000 from the rest of @entity35			0
about 1 million come from @entity253			0
@entity5 , which is on the @entity195 border , has about 460,000 undocumented immigrants , the federal government says			2
at least five other states , including @entity259 , with 2.6 million , have more undocumented immigrants , the government says			0
the other states with more illegal immigrants than @entity5 are @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266			1
a @entity268 survey late last year found that @entity10 believe @entity28 are discriminated against more than any other major racial or ethnic group in @entity10 society			0
the @entity268 survey also indicated that about one - third of the nation 's @entity28 say they or someone they know has experienced discrimination			0
about 9 percent said they had been stopped by police or other authorities and asked about their immigration status in the year before the survey			0
fifty - seven percent of those surveyed said they worried that they , a family member or a close friend could be deported .			0

new : 4 groups announce legal challenge in @entity15
@entity12 , @entity12 of @entity5 , @entity13 slam law
@entity11 also objects to it
