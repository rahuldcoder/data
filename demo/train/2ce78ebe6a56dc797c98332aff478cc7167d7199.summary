-- a @entity2 report blaming a record loss of @entity5 civilian lives last year on insurgents and the @entity7 was dismissed as " untrue " by a @entity7 spokesman saturday			1
meanwhile , a commander of the @entity10 was encouraged by the report 's findings that coalition forces were not to blame for the increased casualties , but agreed that civilian deaths must drop			1
the @entity16 in @entity5 said 3,021 civilians were killed last year , up from 2,790 the prior year			0
in an e-mail sent to @entity0 , @entity7 spokesman @entity18 " strongly " disputed the @entity2 mission 's report as " untrue			1
" " it has been 10 years since @entity23 has started blaming our @entity24 with such numbers and untrue figures while the invading forces are using tons of explosives every day in our country , conducting raids on civilian houses and they are killing our innocent people , " @entity18 said in the e-mail			2
" unfortunately i should say that @entity23 , which is operating under the umbrella of the @entity2 as a propaganda tool for the invading forces , is trying to blame @entity24 for the majority of the killings happening in @entity5 , " @entity18 wrote			1
" it is unfortunate that @entity23 is supporting oppressor @entity40 and other invading forces and is undermining its international reputation , " @entity18 stated			0
a total of 11,864 civilians have been killed in the @entity5 conflict since 2007 , the @entity2 mission said			1
" @entity5 children , women and men continue to be killed in this war in ever - increasing numbers , " @entity47 , the @entity2 special representative for the secretary - general , said in a statement			1
" for much too long @entity5 civilians have paid the highest price of war			0
parties to the conflict must greatly increase their efforts to protect civilians to prevent yet another increase in civilian deaths and injuries in 2012			1
" general @entity65 , @entity10 commander , said the report showed a reduction in coalition - related civilian casualties			1
" every citizen of @entity5 must know @entity10 will continue to do all we can to reduce casualties that affect the @entity5 civilian population			1
this data is promising but there is more work to be done , " @entity65 said in a statement			0
" the most striking -- and obvious -- component of the report is the increasing number of civilian casualties attributed to insurgents , " said @entity65			1
" ieds are now responsible for roughly one out of three civilian casualties according to @entity23			2
the death toll from insurgent attacks is much too high and deserves @entity87 's direct attention and action			2
" the @entity2 report said last year 's deaths are 8 % more than in 2010 , and double the number in 2007			1
the vast majority of 2011 civilian casualties -- 77 % , according to the @entity2 report -- were caused by anti-government forces			1
the number of deaths attributable to the @entity5 army and international forces declined year - over - year by 4 % , to 410			1
the report concludes that the higher number of casualties was due to changing tactics on the part of insurgents , including greater use of improvised explosive devices ( @entity107 ) , deadlier suicide attacks and more targeted assassinations			2
ieds alone killed 967 @entity5 men , women and children in 2011			1
many of the 495 victims of targeted killings were provincial and district governors , peace council members and tribal elders			2
among the most disturbing statistics : in the second half of 2011 , the number of women and children killed grew by 29 and 51 % respectively , compared to 2010			1
that is in part due to the growing use of the pressure - plate ieds , which are indiscriminate -- such that a van carrying civilians is just as likely to set off the explosive as a humvee			0
" a piece of shrapnel had gone through his head			0
my son is dead , and his loss is killing me and my wife			0
he was the only son i had , " said a man in @entity141 , who was quoted in the report			0
" my daughter is nine years old , and every day before i leave for work , she cries : ' @entity147 , do n't go to work , i do n't need to eat , ' " a police officer in @entity149 was quoted as saying			0
the @entity2 report says several statements from @entity7 leaders in 2011 pledging greater efforts to avoid civilian casualties " neither resulted in improved protection of civilians nor minimized civilian casualties			1
" while @entity159 can take comfort from the fact that its forces -- and its allies in the @entity164 -- caused fewer civilian casualties last year , it is clear that overall security for civilians has not improved			2
this is despite the deployment of well over 100,000 international troops across @entity5 in 2011			0
in addition to casualties , the number of @entity5 civilians displaced by conflict soared last year			0
according to the @entity2 high commissioner for refugees , conflict and insecurity displaced some 185,000 people in @entity5 , a jump of 41 % compared to 2010			1
the @entity2 report suggests that there has been a significant geographic shift in casualties			1
as @entity159 and @entity164 units focused on the southern provinces of @entity188 and @entity189 , the number of civilian casualties fell sharply in the second half of 2011			2
but elsewhere -- in southeastern , eastern and northern @entity5 -- incidents rose			0
the number of civilians killed in @entity195 province , including in the capital itself , more than tripled largely because of several devastating suicide bombings			0
the figures show that the number of casualties caused by @entity159 and allied night operations dropped sharply , despite the much greater intensity and frequency of such operations			0
that suggests better intelligence and tactics among pro-government forces			0
but the number of civilian killed in @entity159 airstrikes -- a source of friction with the government of @entity5 president @entity216 -- rose 9 %			2
increasingly , as the transition to @entity5 leadership gets underway , local security duties are being assigned to a relatively new force : the @entity221			0
the @entity2 says it has received " mixed reports " about this entity 's overall performance			2
while most suggested that it had improved security , there were also accounts of human rights abuses and corruption			0
altogether , the @entity16 concludes that " the unremitting toll of civilian casualties coupled with pervasive intimidation affected many civilians directly , and many more indirectly , by fueling uncertainty , tension and fear			0
" the report 's authors welcome " ideas that could contribute toward peace negotiations , " adding their value will be measured by reduced civilian casualties and improved security			2
@entity0 's @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity7 spokesman calls @entity2 report " propaganda "
new : @entity10 commander says deaths caused by insurgents are " much too high "
the rate of conflict - related civilian deaths rose 8 % compared to 2011 , the @entity2 says
the killings of children and women spike , relatively , in the last half of 2011
