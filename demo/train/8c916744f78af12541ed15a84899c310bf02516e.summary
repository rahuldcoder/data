these are not your older brother 's @entity1			2
yeah , there are some helmeted costumes and martial arts in " @entity6 , " the 14 - minute short inspired by the 1990s children 's tv series			1
but there are also some grim postapocalyptic settings , terse dialogue and violence			1
lots and lots of bloody , graphic violence			0
the " bootleg , " in producer @entity20 's term , is the product of a thought experiment : how would fighting an intergalactic war really affect some high schoolers ? ( in the original candy - colored show -- which reused some campy @entity25 programming -- a group of teens gets drafted to battle aliens			1
) " how is that any different from child soldiers , man ? that 's super f * * * ed - up , " @entity20 , the producer of " @entity33 " and " @entity34 , " says in an accompanying video			1
" they 're going to have ptsd , and they 're going have the most f * * * ed - up lives			2
" hence , " @entity6 , " which has been buzzed about all over the @entity43			1
the less - violent version has picked up more than 6 million @entity46 views in less than two days ; the nsfw version has just slightly fewer			1
the video stars @entity49 and @entity50			2
director @entity51 , known as a music video powerhouse ( @entity54 's " @entity53 , " @entity56 ' " @entity55 " ) , told @entity57 that he was unfamiliar with the nuts and bolts of the @entity1 universe but liked the challenge			2
" the trick that i really wanted to do with this was to make that dark and gritty version that everybody keeps talking about , but really do it , " he said			0
" really see if i could totally accomplish it with essentially a really incredible incredibly silly property			0
" the @entity43 was gobsmacked , of course			0
" @entity71 ' reboot is @entity72 f * ck , " headlined @entity69			0
but the video may be in for a legal battle			1
according to @entity51 , the producer of the other " @entity1 , " @entity75 , is " trying to shut ' @entity6 ' down			1
" a new theatrical film version is scheduled for 2016			0
@entity78 took down the @entity80 video tuesday , and @entity81 reported that it was at the behest of a copyright infringement claim			2
@entity51 has fought back on @entity84			0
" every image in ' @entity6 ' is original footage , " he posted in a series of tweets			1
there is no copyrighted footage in the short			0
i am not making any money on it and i refuse to accept any from anyone			0
it was not even kickstarted , i paid for it myself			0

" @entity6 , " *rethinking* of 1990s show , is a huge *online* hit
the 14 - minute video is grim and violent
the video may be *facing* legal *issues*
