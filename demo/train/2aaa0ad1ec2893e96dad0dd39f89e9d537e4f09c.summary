@entity0 -- three weeks until funding starts to dry up for bridge and road projects across the @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity8 committees thursday put @entity9 on track toward a deal to avoid construction shutdowns and to keep the @entity13 operating until early next summer			1
but even as @entity17 and @entity18 drew closer together , some in the transportation industry decried the nearly $ 11 billion proposals as short - term fixes that leave the nation 's bigger infrastructure issues untouched			1
@entity6 and @entity8 day of action without an infusion of cash to the highway fund , the @entity24 has warned that road projects may have to start shutting down in august			1
after months of failed negotiations , key @entity6 and @entity8 committees passed proposals thursday that were relatively close in scope and content			1
previous drafts had differed in the source and size of funding , as well as how long that funding would last			0
thursday both the @entity17 - led @entity39 and the @entity18 - led @entity40 passed bills with the same central dollar figure , $ 10.8 billion			2
that 's enough to keep the fund in business until roughly next summer			0
the two sides also moved closer on where to get the money			0
the @entity8 committee adopted a @entity6 idea , including something called pension smoothing , which allows employers to set aside less money for long - term pension funding			1
one key difference -- the @entity6 bill has a more expanded version of the money - raiser , bringing in three times as much money from pension - smoothing than the @entity8			1
the bills are much closer on the amount of money they 'd raise from an extended increase in customs fees			0
and they would each transfer $ 1 billion out of funds for underground storage leaks			0
@entity17 and @entity18 senators stressed they had made compromises			0
finance chairman @entity75 had previously insisted on a long - term deal			1
" colleagues , i want it understood that ( pushing for a longer - term solution ) was my position at the beginning of the negotiations , " the @entity78 @entity77 said to his committee			1
" but it was clear that it would not be possible to reach a bipartisan agreement ( for a longer - term deal )			1
" his @entity17 counterpart echoed the story of tradeoffs			0
" while i wo n't say i 've gotten everything i wanted , " ranking @entity17 @entity94 admitted , " i will say i think we 've reached a deal that can satisfy both @entity18 and @entity17			0
" differences remain both bills passed their respective committees on relatively easy voice votes thursday			2
but even as they issued warm statements across the north - south axis of the @entity104 , lawmakers warned of the remaining differences ahead			1
" i commend chairman @entity75 and @entity94 for putting together a bill that provides roughly $ 11 billion , as we did , " wrote @entity108 chairman @entity107 in a statement			0
" however ... it is inconceivable that the @entity6 would , as the @entity8 proposes to do , grant the @entity113 additional authority to audit and investigate taxpayers simply so @entity0 can spend more money			1
" @entity107 's office would not confirm it , but the @entity118 @entity17 seemed to be objecting to a @entity8 provision that would increase the amount of time the @entity113 has to audit taxpayers who incorrectly estimate property values , from three years now to six years			2
that measure alone raises over $ 1 billion			0
each bill is expected to pass its respective chamber , with the @entity6 planning to vote on its version next week			1
then the two sides must quickly agree to a compromise bill if they want to keep money flowing and avoid construction slowdowns starting in august			2
transportation group fires back as lawmakers breathe a cautious sigh of relief and move toward avoiding another crisis , some in the road construction industry see little reason to celebrate			1
" these actions are the latest ' punt and leave the stadium ' strategy that has plagued the federal surface transportation program for far too long , " wrote @entity139 , president of the @entity140			2
his group and others have been clamoring for a long - term fix , after 11 stopgap measures in five years			1
but the politics are a problem			0
the highway fund currently relies on six types of taxes , including the federal gas tax			0
and @entity17 ' anti-tax mantra has prevented all but a few from supporting any increase in those fees			0
hence , what could be a rare ahead - of - deadline deal in @entity9 looks like continued instability and lack - of - decision to those in road construction			2
" our message to @entity9 is simple : your job is n't close to being done , " @entity139 concluded			0
feds warn states : road construction money running out			2

the @entity176 has warned that without an infusion of cash , road projects might start shutting
@entity6 and @entity8 committees pass proposals to avoid that
but some in transportation industry decry short - term fixes instead of longer - range plans
