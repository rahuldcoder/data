@entity0 -- the chances of immigration reform passing in the @entity4 this year were already slim before its majority leader , @entity5 , lost his primary on tuesday			1
so , by the time @entity5 announced on wednesday that he was stepping down from his leadership post on july 31 , those who oppose any type of amnesty for illegal immigrants were sounding the death knell for related legislation on @entity15			0
in his victory speech , @entity16 , the economics professor who defeated @entity5 by double digits , cited the lawmaker 's willingness to consider a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants as one of his opponent 's weak flanks			1
and pundits said that will be a lesson to others who might dare to push for reform			0
" it is a bombshell , " @entity1 senior political analyst @entity34 said on @entity1 of @entity5 's loss			1
" i think it does mean more gridlock ahead , especially on immigration			0
immigration reform is now dead			1
" those who support such measures as granting a pathway to citizenship to @entity45 — the children of those who came to the country illegally — raced to put @entity5 's defeat in context			1
" some things do not change after a primary			0
even a primary result that no one , including the winning candidate , had predicted , " rep. @entity52 , an @entity54 @entity53 and staunch immigration advocate , said on the @entity4 floor on wednesday			0
" immigration reform is not dead			1
it might just be moving to the @entity4 for action if none comes from this @entity4			0
" there was always a short window in this @entity66 to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation in the @entity4 before lawmakers leave for the summer in august and before the midterm elections in november , legal and political experts say			1
maybe immigration reform is n't dead after all last year , the @entity72 approved a sweeping immigration reform package , including a path to citizenship for an estimated 8 million of the more than 11 million undocumented workers in the country , according to figures from the @entity79			1
though roughly one - third of @entity81 supported the measure , the legislation stalled in the @entity81 - controlled @entity4 as lawmakers there weighed more gradual reforms			0
@entity5 had publicly backed proposals giving dreamers the chance to receive some type of legal status , however he voted against the broader @entity72 measure			2
" @entity5 ignored the advice of every @entity81 pollster and tried to be wishy - washy on immigration , " @entity52 told @entity1 in a statement			1
" he did n't convince the pro-immigration side he was with them and he did n't convince the anti-immigration side he was with them			0
that is not what happened to @entity103 ( @entity105 ) @entity104 in @entity106 , @entity52 ( @entity108 ) @entity107 in @entity109 , or a number of others who have made a clear case for immigration reform that is not ' amnesty			1
' " @entity5 's loss might make other republicans facing conservative challenges skittish , said @entity118 , an immigration law professor at @entity119			1
" one primary does not determine the fate of immigration reform , however it does make it harder for @entity81 to do anything before the @entity126 , " @entity118 said			1
but it 's not all up to the @entity4			0
should @entity128 use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform ? president @entity128 has also been under pressure from immigration activists and members of his own party to use executive action to push through reform — especially if the @entity4 fails to act before the recess			1
he rejected any notion that @entity5 's defeat means the end for immigration reform in the @entity4 -- a message he said he would relay to speaker @entity145			1
" at a certain point , issues are important enough to fight for			0
my argument about yesterday 's election is not that there was too little politics -- there was too little conviction about what was right , " @entity128 said at a fundraiser in @entity149 , according to a press pool account			2
" we need to get immigration reform done			2
" the flood of hundreds of unaccompanied children crossing into this country daily and overflowing holding centers is an issue that could further hasten the administration to act , immigration legal experts say			0
@entity128 has called the border situation involving children " an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response " and has established a group that will work across federal agencies to help address the problem			2
in the meantime , supporters also want the president to do more to slow the record number of deportations during his presidency			0
there have been roughly 2 million deportations under @entity128 , a number that far eclipses previous presidencies and led the head of the @entity185 to dub him " the deporter - in - chief			2
" he has directed the administration to reexamine its deportation policy			0
immigration reform advocates also want the administration to make noncriminals and minor offenders the lowest deportation priorities and extend amnesty to the parents and guardians of @entity45			2
" just because @entity5 lost does n't mean that all of those other conversations and criticisms about not doing something about immigration goes away , " said @entity197 , a @entity198 historian and @entity1 contributor			2
" the likelihood was that the president was planning to use executive action anyway regardless of what happened to @entity5			0

@entity5 's *stunning* primary loss tuesday was a blow to immigration reform
@entity5 's opponent made an issue of the majority leader 's position on so - called " dreamers "
president @entity128 faces *increasing* pressure to use power of pen on immigration reform
