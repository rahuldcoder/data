@entity0 -- a competitor of the @entity5 can bring a private lawsuit against the beverage giant over allegations of false advertising in a juice product , the @entity3 @entity2 ruled thursday			1
the 8 - 0 decision is a win for @entity13 , a @entity14 - based firm			0
it claimed @entity5 's @entity17 brand was cheating consumers through deceptive labeling in its @entity21 beverage , which the court said " in truth ... contains but 0.3 % pomegranate juice and 0.2 % blueberry juice			1
" at issue was whether one federal law regulating and enforcing food labeling preempted or overrode efforts by private parties to bring lawsuits under a separate federal law			1
those two laws are the @entity34 , or @entity34 , and the @entity35			0
" nothing in the text , history , or structure of the @entity34 or the @entity35 shows the congressional purpose or design to forbid these ( private ) suits , " justice @entity36 wrote for the unanimous court			0
" quite to the contrary , the @entity34 and the @entity35 complement each other in the federal regulation of misleading food and beverage labels			1
competitors , in their own interest , may bring @entity35 claims like @entity13 's that challenge food and beverage labels that are regulated by the @entity34			1
" lower courts had sided with @entity53 - based @entity5 , a global brand			2
but the justices concluded that while the federal government can go after misleading labels , private parties can also challenge " practices that allegedly mislead and trick consumers			0
" @entity13 , which produces pomegranate juices and products , has also faced allegations of deceptive advertising			0
it was separately sued by the @entity64 in 2010 , for making " false and unsubstantiated " health claims , and the agency had asked @entity13 to remove the claims from its ads. the current case is @entity13 v. @entity5 ( 12 - 761 )			2
justice @entity70 did not participate in deciding this appeal .			0

@entity13 has *accused* a @entity5 brand of deceptive labeling
at issue was whether a labeling law *clashed* with private efforts to sue under a separate law
the laws " complement each other " in regulating misleading food and drink labels , court says
