@entity5 is developing a computer system that could theoretically customize healthy recipes based on your personal taste buds			1
an outline of the project was presented as part of the company 's annual 5 in 5 list -- five inventions that could change the world in five years			0
" at the end of the day , taste is about chemistry , " @entity17 , vice president of innovation at @entity5 , told @entity19			1
so how would it work ? @entity5 's @entity24 takes on lawmakers in game effort " the system analyzes foods in terms of how chemical compounds interact with each other , the number of atoms in each compound , and the bonding structure and shapes of compounds , " wrote @entity5 research scientist @entity27			1
" coupled with psychophysical data and models on which chemicals produce perceptions of pleasantness , familiarity and enjoyment , the end result is a unique recipe , using combinations of ingredients that are scientifically flavorful			0
our brains determine a food 's flavor by how chemicals in the food react with our nose sensors and taste buds			2
@entity5 's system would break down the chemical components of each meal , then collect taste data based on your feedback			1
it would then use that information to create recipes that would appeal to you on a molecular level			2
basically , " in five years , a computer system will know what i want to eat better than i do , " @entity27 said			1
@entity24 's win does n't make humanity obsolete -- yet @entity27 and his team hope that by optimizing flavor , they will be able to reduce health issues related to nutrition			0
a person could program the computer to personalized taste ( hold the mushrooms ! ) and medical necessities ( low sodium , please )			2
" the best recipes will start with the right molecules , " @entity27 said			0
@entity5 will go all @entity24 on your commute			0

@entity5 is developing computer system to analyze food based on molecules
the system could *potentially* create personalized , healthy recipes
" at the end of the day , taste is about chemistry , " an @entity5 innovation *expert* says
