" because of the sanctions , we needed hard currency for development -- otherwise our country would be left behind , " said deputy energy minister @entity77			2

" we have had contact with @entity1 monks who have money to pay for the grid systems for their surrounding villages			2
so there 's different ownership business models and i think policy should be addressed to make it open			2
