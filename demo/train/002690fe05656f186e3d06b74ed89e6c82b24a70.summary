at first blush , the biography of @entity2 actress @entity1 could read very much like my own			1
@entity1 is a working actress who supports social causes in her time away from set			1
the difference ? in october , @entity1 was sentenced to 18 months in prison for her peaceful activism			1
in this regard , she is just the latest in a string of filmmakers and actors of @entity2 cinema -- including acclaimed filmmakers @entity15 and @entity17 and actor @entity18 -- to be arrested or sentenced to lengthy prison terms in recent years			1
@entity15 and @entity17 each were sentenced to prison -- the former for six years and the latter for five -- and banned from filmmaking for 20 years , accused of making " anti-regime propaganda			0
" @entity18 , a prominent actor , was sentenced to prison after he was arrested in anti-government protests			0
many more have been arrested and jailed			0
in my role as a spokesperson for @entity30 and as a supporter of various charitable causes including @entity33 , a campaign to release prisoners of conscience in @entity33 , i have never been faced with the threat of intimidation or arrest			2
indeed , i can not even fathom that speaking out for the most vulnerable in society and those locked up for peaceful expression and activities would , in turn , be grounds for my own detention and arrest by government authorities			0
a celebrated and hugely popular actress in her native @entity33 , @entity1 first landed on the radar of the @entity2 authorities for her open support of opposition figure @entity53 , which led to her arrest in july 2009 in the aftermath of a disputed presidential election in @entity33			1
another arrest in july 2011 followed , as well as a ban on her leaving the country			0
now she has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for " acting against national security and links to foreign media			0
" the idea that an actress -- mostly lauded for her performances in more than a dozen films -- somehow represents a threat to @entity33 's national security is laughable at best			2
but in @entity1 's case , far from anything humorous , the allegations have actually resulted in the sober prospect of real prison time			2
ironically , @entity1 's sentence was handed down just a month after the reopening of the @entity78 in @entity79 , which had been unceremoniously ordered to shut its doors during the tenure of former president @entity82			2
although the reopening was welcomed by many as a delivery of one of the promises that president @entity89 made on the campaign trail to increase cultural freedoms for @entity2 , the reality is that artists such as @entity1 , rapper @entity93 and poets @entity94 and @entity96 -- who were arrested in december and later released -- continue to come under fire for their peaceful exercise of creative expression			1
and it 's not only artists who languish in @entity33 's prisons			2
according to @entity33 's reporting , at least 845 people are prisoners of conscience in @entity33 , jailed for the peaceful exercise of their lifestyle , beliefs or profession			1
the list of hundreds includes lawyers , students , bloggers , journalists , labor union activists and political opponents			0
the crisis is so acute that @entity119 secretary general ban ki - moon recently admonished the @entity2 government for continuing to jail a large number of political prisoners			1
and just last month , the mandate of a @entity119 expert assessing @entity33 's human rights record was renewed for yet another year because of the chronic nature of human rights abuses in the country			1
aside from all the reports of abuses , it is an odd thing when your counterpart in another society has experiences that are directly opposite to your own			0
my human rights activism has been widely met with encouragement and support			1
ahangarani should earn plaudits , not only for her cinematic achievements , but also for her humanitarian deeds and her commitment to increased rights and freedoms for all			0
she should not be intimidated and silenced with the threat of a lengthy prison sentence looming over her head			0
@entity141 's only " crime " is that she dared be an agent of change and speak out in support of women and young people			0
the @entity2 leadership is keen to prove that it is ready to engage with the international community , both on resolution of the nuclear issue in ongoing negotiations and renewal of economic ties			2
in addition to these concerns , human rights should be made an equal priority			1
a good first step would be the unconditional pardon of the 843 prisoners of rights and the hundreds of others , such as @entity1 , who are waiting to serve out their sentences			1
@entity177 , and all those risking their own freedom to ensure the rights of others , are national treasures , not national traitors .			0

@entity2 @entity1 is actress and activist , as is @entity2 - born @entity187
but @entity187 has never been *harassed* for activism , while @entity1 is sentenced to jail
@entity187 : 845 people are political prisoners in @entity33 , from all walks of life and *careers*
@entity187 : human rights in @entity33 should be just as *important* as nuclear issues
