-- @entity2 golfer @entity1 made himself the player to beat at the @entity4 with a late surge on saturday , claiming a one - shot lead going into the final round of the @entity9 tournament			1
the 39 - year - old birdied four of the last five holes on saturday to card a six - under - par 66 which moved him up to 11 - under 205 , leapfrogging overnight leader @entity14 of @entity15			1
@entity17 @entity16 vice-captain @entity1 , last a winner at the 2010 @entity19 in @entity20 , is aiming for his 11th tour title having followed up friday 's round of 65 with another strong showing			1
" when you finish a round with four birdies in the last five , you have to walk off very happy , " @entity1 told the @entity9 website			0
" i played fantastic yesterday to shoot that 65 and felt comfortable this morning , and felt good with the way my golf is			0
" i 'm feeling quite comfortable on the golf course considering it 's been a while since i 've been in that kind of situation , so i 'm pleased with the way the day panned out			0
" @entity36 , ranked 478th in the world , could not improve on friday 's second - round 66 as he finished on 69 after his second bogey of the round at the final hole -- but is still in second place with 18 to play on sunday			1
the 42 - year - old , who was without a single top - 20 finish on the @entity9 last year and is playing only by virtue of a sponsor 's invitation , is confident he can reignite his career with success in the @entity49			1
" obviously when you bogey the last , it 's never nice			0
but i just had a really bad shot -- it happens , and the rest was good , " said @entity14 , who birdied the fourth and sixth before his first slip at the ninth			0
" i made a few crunch putts at the end			0
i got a bit lazy with my shots but i managed to keep my score good , and just one shot back is nothing			0
" defending champion @entity63 is also still in touch with the leaders as he seeks to become the first player to win back - to - back titles in the event			1
the @entity69 was just three strokes behind @entity1 in third spot after carding five birdies in his last seven holes for a 69 which put him on 208			0
@entity75 of @entity76 also shot 69 to finish the day in fourth place on seven under , while @entity79 's @entity78 ( 66 ) and @entity81 's @entity80 ( 71 ) tied for fifth on six under			2

but a disappointing round of 75 left @entity76 's first - round leader and 2007 champion @entity90 tied for 28th place on 215 alongside world no. 2 @entity93 and @entity79 's @entity94 ( 69 )			2
@entity93 could replace @entity95 at the top of the rankings with a first or second - place finish after the @entity81 missed the weekend cut , but was 10 shots off the pace despite his best round of the week			2
the @entity103 made up for a ninth - hole bogey with five subsequent birdies -- including one at the last -- but his opening 77 and friday 's 70 mean he has a mountain to climb			1
meanwhile , @entity110 continued to defy expectations by leading at the halfway stage of the @entity115 's weather - affected @entity113 in @entity116			0
the 35 - year - old , who played on the second - tier @entity118 last year before earning his card , followed up his opening eight - under 63 with a 65 to be one shot clear of fellow @entity123 @entity122 when the second round was finally completed on saturday			1
three - time masters champion @entity125 also shot 65 to be tied for fifth with 2010 rookie of the year @entity126 , who fired a tournament - best 62 to also be on 132 -- four shots off the lead			1
the @entity131 tournament is expected to finish on monday after seven hours ' play has been lost so far due to freezing morning conditions .			0

@entity1 takes one - shot lead on *penultimate* day of @entity4 after a round of 66
the 39 - year - old shot a bogey - free round to usurp @entity15 's @entity14 at the top
@entity36 could not repeat friday 's 66 and finished on 69 after bogey at final hole
defending champion @entity63 is still in with a chance , three shots off lead
