@entity0 to @entity1 , the @entity2 -- the weather forecasters had warned that @entity5 was one of the most unpredictable storms in memory			1
three of the world 's leading weather agencies came up with three different paths for the storm as it slowly , but relentlessly , bore down on the @entity2 packing winds in excess of 200 kilometers per hour ( 124 mph )			2
for me , that unpredictability turned traveling from @entity0 to @entity1 from a routine 90 - minute flight into a 31 - hour slog			1
i needed to be there to cover the typhoon 's impact on a town traumatized by the impact of @entity25 last year			1
it looked pretty simple at the beginning			0
jump on the @entity29 flight from @entity30 , head straight for domestic departures , where i would then board a flight to @entity1 -- a flight of little more than an hour			1
typhoon tracker : follow @entity5 planes ... 10:30 a.m. came and went with no sign of a boarding call			1
i began to meet other journalists waiting for the same flight who were equally at a loss as to what was happening			2
we were eventually approached by a @entity47 manager , apologizing profusely			0
" technical difficulties " had apparently grounded the aircraft but we were assured there would be another flight at 1.30 p.m. all other flights to different parts of the @entity2 were on schedule , so we were confident about this next take - off time			2
but as the time approached , no boarding call came			0
a brief announcement informed us the flight was canceled because of continuing " technical difficulties			2
" and so it went			0
another airlines staff member presented us with new boarding passes for a 3.45 p.m. flight			2
fifteen minutes before departure we were sitting patiently on the airport bus waiting to be taken out to the apron and it looked as if we would finally be on our way			2
but the bus did n't move			0
we sat for 30 minutes until another announcement of another delay			2
we trudged back to the boarding gate , very frustrated			0
other routes were being discussed but all ferries had been canceled and the direct flight still looked the best bet			1
more than an hour later we learned that all flights were canceled because of the weather conditions in @entity1			1
we appeared to be stuck where the story was n't			0
blades ... and so to @entity84 hasty conference call with the @entity30 news desk and a new plan : charter a light aircraft			0
a private operator thought they could get a few of us into @entity1 at first light saturday			1
the final decision on weather conditions would be made at 4 a.m. at the appointed time the news came through : conditions were too dangerous to risk it			0
another call to @entity30 and we decided that it could be possible to fly to @entity103 and take the short hop to @entity1 by helicopter			1
i boarded my flight at 11 a.m. and was on the island inside the hour to be met by the helicopter crew			1
i knew i was in good hands when i met my pilot , retired military man col. @entity111			0
his flying career included flying four former @entity2 presidents around the country , as well as the late pope @entity115 he had already flown two sorties that morning to @entity1 but my anxieties grew as he described the flights			1
he was forced to touch down early on both journeys because of the conditions -- and they were growing worse by the hour			0
the biggest worry , he said , were strong wings that could literally break the rotor blades			0
if we encountered excessive winds he would reduce the flying speed and edge ahead , waiting for a break in the weather			2
i was his only passenger but he took along an engineer to help " just in case			0
" i buckled into the front seat next to @entity133 and off we went into a murky cloud - filled sky			0
we flew at between 1,000 and 2,000 feet over a white - capped sea , towards increasingly thick clouds			0
our pilot seemed unworried until we got to the tip of @entity141 and the town of @entity143 , which lies at the foot of a range of mountains separating us from @entity1			1
one look at the cloud ahead and he tapped me on the arm and indicated the flight had come to an end			1
we put down on a playing field and i jumped out			0
. i was soon surrounded by a group of locals , who managed to rustle up a van			1
ten minutes later we on the road driving along a virtually deserted road in heavy rain , towards the mountains and @entity1			1
it took two hours to make the 100 kilometer ( 62 mile ) journey			0
at 4 p.m. , 31 hours after touching down in @entity0 , i finally arrived at my destination .			1

@entity3 's @entity166 was trying to get to @entity1 ahead of @entity5
after *multiple* flight cancellations , he chartered a helicopter then rustled up a van from locals
trip normally takes 90 minutes with a direct flight from @entity0
@entity1 suffered the brunt of @entity25 13 *months* *ago*
