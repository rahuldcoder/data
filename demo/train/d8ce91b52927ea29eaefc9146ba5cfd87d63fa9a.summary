@entity0 , the former @entity2 governor , is ending his weekend program on @entity4 -- effective immediately -- as he contemplates another run for president			1
" i wo n't make a decision about running until late in the spring of 2015 , but the continued chatter has put @entity4 into a position that is not fair to them , " @entity0 wrote in a letter to supporters saturday evening released before his show started airing			1
" the honorable thing to do at this point is to end my tenure here at @entity4 so i can openly talk with potential donors and supporters and gauge support , " he added			1
on his saturday night program , titled " @entity0 , " he said goodbye to viewers while insisting he had n't made up his mind yet about actually running			1
he put it this way : " as much as i have loved doing the show , i can not bring myself to rule out another presidential run			1
oh , to be clear , i 'm not making that announcement right now			0
" he said he 'd probably continue to make guest appearances on @entity4 -- " i hope so ! " -- and he thanked the network 's chairman @entity29 for " the past six and a half years of support			1
" some of @entity0 's rivals might say the weekly platform on @entity4 — where he reached about 1.3 million viewers — gave him a leg - up			1
in a recent @entity1 / @entity37 poll about potential @entity39 presidential candidates , @entity0 received the support of 6 percent of respondents , putting him tied for fourth place			2
related : @entity1 / @entity37 poll : @entity44 surges to 2016 @entity39 frontrunner on saturday afternoon @entity0 had urged his followers on @entity47 and @entity48 to tune in for an announcement " that will make news for sure			1
" in his subsequent letter , he wrote , " as much as i have loved doing the show , i love my country more , and feel that it may be time for me to enter a zone of comfort to engage in the conflicts that have almost destroyed the bedrock foundations of @entity60			0
" " i feel compelled to ascertain if the support exists strongly enough for another @entity63 run			0
so as we say in television , stay tuned ! " a spokeswoman for @entity0 reaffirmed that he would make a decision about a run by " late spring			2
" but by quitting the program now , @entity0 avoids further questions about the conflict between his television perch and a tantalizing bid for the presidency			1
those questions arose two months ago after the @entity76 reported that @entity0 was rebuilding a political team			2
it has been no secret that @entity0 has been pondering another run for president			2
he has been holding meetings with @entity39 donors and recruiting staffers for a potential campaign			0
but he has been " very careful about this " -- his words , in an interview with the @entity76 , in november -- because of the potential conflict between his television show and a campaign			0
@entity0 mounted an unsuccessful run for the @entity39 nomination in 2008			2
later that year , he started to host the show			0
amid speculation about a possible run in 2012 , he teased an announcement in may 2011 but ended up telling viewers that he 'd opted against a bid : " all the factors say ' go ' but my heart says ' no. ' " political prognosticators have said that a @entity0 run is more likely this time around			1
after @entity105 story in november , a @entity4 executive said the network was " taking a serious look " at his political activity and " evaluating his current status			0
" in the past , @entity4 has terminated the contracts of employees who take clear steps toward political candidacies , by forming an exploratory committee , for instance			0
in early november it severed @entity118 's contributor contract			0
related : @entity118 leaves @entity4 , mulls run @entity120 said nothing further about @entity0 's status until saturday , when a network spokesperson confirmed that it had " amicably parted ways with @entity0			1
" @entity0 , in his on - air sign - off , positioned it the same way			0
" i agree with @entity4 that this is the right thing , and now is the right time , " he said , while acknowledging the network 's " generous paycheck			2
" while hosting a show and abiding by @entity4 's restrictions , he said , it is not " possible for me to openly determine political and financial support to justify a race			1
" now that process will presumably begin			0
@entity0 is already scheduled to visit @entity140 later this month			0
he also has a new book coming out			0
so what will @entity120 do with @entity0 's time slot ? a spokesperson said the network would run " various specials " for the next few weeks and try out " a few new ideas			1
" @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this report .			0

@entity0 told his tv viewers and *emailed* his supporters that he was ending his show and considering a 2016 bid
@entity0 said his presidential *consideration* put @entity4 in a tough position so he decided to halt his program
@entity4 confirmed the announcement saturday that this evening 's show will be @entity0 's last
