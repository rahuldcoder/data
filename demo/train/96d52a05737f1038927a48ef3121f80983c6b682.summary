@entity0 -- december 's school massacre in @entity3 , @entity4 , has prompted congressional lawmakers and the @entity6 to offer a number of proposals aimed at curbing gun violence			1
here are some of the measures garnering the most attention : the @entity6 plan president @entity14 signed 23 executive actions , which do n't require congressional approval , to strengthen existing gun laws and take related steps on mental health and school safety			2
he has also called on @entity21 to reinstate the @entity23 - era assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 , to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds , and to expand background checks to anyone buying a gun , whether at a store or in a private sale at an auction or convention			1
assault weapons ban revisited a proposal by sen. @entity35 , @entity36 , would not ban ownership of assault weapons outright , but would prohibit new ones from being manufactured , sold or imported			1
it would also outlaw ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds			0
she said the goal is to " dry up the supply of these weapons over time			0
" the measure , along with a companion bill in the @entity6 , is opposed by the nation 's powerful gun lobby , led by the @entity50			0
gun focus shifts from ban to checks and trafficking cracking down on straw purchases @entity57 @entity56 sen. @entity56 , chairman of the @entity58 , has called for stronger background checks and a crackdown on so - called straw purchases , in which people who can pass background checks buy weapons for others			1
@entity56 has proposed a measure to increase penalties for straw purchasers			0
curbing gun trafficking a new @entity6 bipartisan gun control bill seeks to make gun trafficking a federal crime			2
it has some bipartisan support and mirrors a measure proposed in the @entity58			2
@entity6 @entity78 efforts a group of @entity80 , who were part of the chamber 's @entity82 , unveiled 15 proposals to address gun violence			2
the measures largely echoed those previously backed by the @entity6			0
the package is similar to other @entity78 measures that would address background checks , ban high capacity magazines , and crack down on gun trafficking			1
@entity6 majority leader @entity93 , @entity94 , told @entity1 that he supports beefed up background checks for gun sales			2
@entity3 calls on @entity4 to ' show @entity97 the way ' on gun control closing gun show loophole a group of four senators working behind the scenes on a bipartisan bill to expand background checks on gun sales is making significant progress , according to sources in both parties familiar with their work			1
the group includes sen. @entity112 , @entity113 , who has an a rating with the @entity50 , and sen. @entity115 , @entity116 , a long time advocate of gun rights			0
the legislation would effectively require background checks on private gun purchases made with non-licensed gun dealers , according to sources in both parties			1
that would include closing the so - called gun show loophole			0
why new laws could miss @entity97 's bigger gun problem political play house speaker @entity128 has said he has no plans to bring any measure up for a vote until the @entity58 acts first			0
@entity132 oppose any assault weapons ban and rural - state @entity80 facing tough re-election fights are unlikely to support it as well , meaning that proposal has little chance of passing @entity21			1
there is some bipartisan support for expanded background checks , especially to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illness			1
a number of lawmakers may also support limiting the size of ammunition magazines			0
some lawmakers have said that various gun proposals may be addressed in separate bills , rather than a comprehensive package , which could more easily be targeted by opponents			0
the top @entity56 in @entity21 , senate majority leader @entity154 of @entity155 , has a good rating from gun rights groups and has said he would work to ensure that a variety of proposals are brought to the floor for consideration			2
he opposed the 1994 assault weapons ban and has indicated support for expanding background checks but refuses to endorse a new weapons prohibition			1
gun debate : where is the middle ground ?			0
