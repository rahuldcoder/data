-- blood from @entity3 that was found on the uniform and in the police car of officer @entity6 appears to back the officer 's version of events , but still leaves questions unanswered , law enforcement sources told @entity0			1
those sources corroborated to @entity0 details first reported by @entity13 about the officer 's version of events in @entity6 's shooting of the unarmed teen on august 9 in @entity18 , @entity19			1
@entity3 's blood was found on @entity6 's gun , on the squad car 's interior and on the officer 's uniform , according to a @entity27 law enforcement official and a second source with knowledge of the forensics presented to the grand jury			1
the source corroborated what the @entity13 reported			2
at least one of the wounds @entity3 suffered is consistent with a struggle and appeared to be fired at close range , according to a different source with first - hand knowledge of the investigation			2
this finding could lend credibility to @entity6 's account that he was fearful for his life after a struggle with @entity3 in the police car			1
however , it is not necessarily a " @entity50 moment , " the @entity27 law enforcement official told @entity0 , adding it is just one data point in a larger investigation			0
the revelations do not answer the question of whether the officer intended to deprive @entity3 of his civil rights when he stepped out of the car and fired the fatal shot , the first law enforcement official said			1
according to the @entity13 , the officer told authorities that @entity3 hit him and scratched him repeatedly , leaving bruises on his face and neck			1
@entity67 forensic tests showed the gun was fired twice in the car , with one bullet hitting @entity3 's arm while the second one missed , the newspaper said			1
the attorney for the family of the slain teen called again monday for an indictment of @entity6			2
attorney @entity76 said the new details should n't preclude @entity6 's prosecution for the teen 's death			1
" if nothing else , you have two competing stories here , " he said in an appearance on @entity0 's " @entity82			0
" he said leaks about the case are making people " weary about the process " and that only an open trial where all the facts are presented will help resolve lingering tensions over the shooting			0
@entity3 's death is the subject of two inquires : one by a @entity98 grand jury considering whether the 28 - year - old officer should be charged , and the other by federal investigators looking into whether any civil rights violations occurred			1
' helpful testimony ' @entity0 legal analyst @entity103 said the new account appears to be " strong evidence " favoring the officer , but " the real focus on the case will shift to what happened outside of the car when @entity3 ran away , according to many witnesses , " @entity103 said			1
" i think the focus will shift on the officer , " @entity103 said			0
" he is not out of the woods yet , even though this is helpful testimony for him			0
" complete coverage of the @entity18 shooting and protests but one critic of the government 's response to @entity3 's shooting reacted angrily to the report			1
@entity123 , a @entity18 resident who was among activists meeting with @entity27 attorney general @entity125 in august , found the newspaper account of @entity6 's testimony " so hard to believe			1
" she said the report addressed only the initial encounter and not the subsequent fatal shooting , when some witnesses said @entity3 was surrendering with his hands up			1
but police said @entity6 shot @entity3 after the teen attacked him and tried to take his gun			1
" if ( @entity3 ) struggled with this officer , this still does not justify why this child is not alive , " @entity123 said			1
" if this young man did this , and struggled , that means he got free			0
and then witnesses said he turned around with his hands up			0
this kid should still be alive			0
" in an interview with @entity0 on monday , @entity125 sought to manage expectations of activists in @entity18 , acknowledging the high standard investigators must meet , and the possibility there may not be any charges against @entity6			0
no particular outcome was promised , aside from a fair investigation and reform of the local police department , @entity125 noted			0
his promise to the people of @entity18 , @entity125 said , is to carry out an independent investigation , and a closer look at the police department itself			0
" we have a ' pattern of practice ' investigation going into the police department			0
so i think that we 're doing all that we can with regard to the promises that i 've made , " @entity125 said			0
witnesses ' version a stark contrast most of the accounts of @entity3 's shooting have focused on what happened outside the car -- on the street -- with conflicting narratives			1
@entity177 , 22 , who was walking with @entity3 on the street when the shooting occurred , told @entity0 that the officer pulled up and told them to get on a sidewalk			2
they told him they were almost home and would be off the street shortly			0
the officer drove forward , but stopped and backed up , almost hitting the pair , @entity177 said			0
" we were so close , almost inches away , that when he tried to open his door aggressively , the door ricocheted both off me and @entity195 's body and closed back on the officer , " he said			0
still in his car , the officer grabbed @entity3 by his neck , but he tried to pull away as the officer pulled him toward him , @entity177 said			2
the officer drew his weapon and fired , hitting @entity3 , @entity177 said			2
a bloodied @entity3 took off running , but the officer followed him and fired , according to @entity177			2
@entity3 turned around with his hands up and told the officer he was unarmed , but the officer fired and the teen hit the ground , @entity177 said			2
another witness , @entity210 , has said she saw @entity6 and @entity3 " tussling through the window " of the police cruiser			2
@entity0 's @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .			0

nothing in a @entity13 report would block prosecution , a @entity3 family attorney says
it 's *important* to have a *public* airing of all facts at trial , @entity76 says
investigators found @entity3 's blood on the officer 's gun , uniform and cruiser , sources say
an inquiry has found no civil rights violations , according to the @entity13
