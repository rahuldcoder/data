@entity1 , @entity0 -- " hey , hey it 's @entity3 " is the latest comic creation to emerge from the @entity6 film market			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 star in the camp classic " @entity7			1
" an unabashed celebration of girlishness , the coming - of - age movie tells the story of @entity3 , a bespectacled and awkward teen			1
looked down on as nerd at her posh private school , @entity3 ( played by newcomer @entity17 ) reinvents herself after befriending @entity20 , an older girl who goes to the local public school			2
bearing a passing resemblance to the runaway @entity25 indie hit " @entity26 " , " @entity3 " could well go on to imitate some of the worldwide success of its hipper @entity25 cousin			2
if the film is to do well , its kitschness can surely only work to its advantage			0
after all , many of the @entity6 comedies that have found success with an international audience have relied on more than just a smattering of camp			1
oddly , from a country that brought the world " @entity42 " and @entity43 , many of the biggest comic hits fly in the face of the conventional stereotypes of @entity6 culture as straight - talking and macho			1
for every " @entity52 " , in other words , there is a " @entity57 " , riding triumphantly over the horizon ready to unsettle the manhood and steal the laughs into the bargain			0
it was @entity60 's comic creation @entity61 , the laidback survivalist from the outback that first put @entity6 comic films on the map over 20 years ago			1
the first " @entity52 " film was released in 1986 to huge commercial success worldwide -- it was the highest grossing film internationally that year -- spawned two sequels and was credited with boosting the @entity6 tourist industry			1
a lot of the laughs in the film come from the depiction of @entity61 ( played by @entity60 ) as an unreconstructed , @entity6 bloke struggling to come to terms with modern metropolitan life when he leaves small town @entity6 to visit @entity77			1
in one scene , for example , @entity61 's reaction to meeting a cross-dresser on the streets of the @entity81 is to grab the man 's crotch to verify his gender			0
@entity52 's comic book version of @entity6 identity may have worked well in the movie theaters , but it was viewed by many critics as hackneyed and out of touch with the reality of modern @entity6			1
the arrival of the writer and director @entity94 in the early ' 90s seemed to breath fresh life into @entity6 film			1
the stunning critical and financial success of his debut feature , " @entity99 " in 1992 heralded a string of breakout hits that were n't afraid to show their feminine side			2
the story of a young ballroom dancer who flouts convention and risks the ire of the judges by dancing his own moves , " @entity99 " provoked a bidding war at the @entity113 after it won the @entity115 award			2
alongside a realistic portrayal of @entity6 small town life , there is a warm - hearted send up of the peculiar world of ballroom dancing			2
from the sequined costumes to the @entity124 soundtrack , the movie is also saturated in campness and kitsch			0
the benchmark set by @entity94 , whose 2001 stellar musical feature " @entity129 ! " was also defiantly camp , was matched by " @entity7 " in 1994 and by " @entity131 " to a lesser extent the same year			2
" @entity7 " in particular created a huge stir when it was first released			0
starring the venerable @entity137 actor @entity11 , @entity9 and @entity10 , it is the story of three drag queens driving across the outback from @entity140 to @entity141 in a large bus they have named @entity7			0
it has gone on to be regarded as a camp classic -- though perhaps not in @entity145 , where it was reportedly banned for fear it might encourage homosexuality			0
less overtly camp than " @entity7 " , " @entity131 " celebrates the lighter side of femininity			0
the story of a socially awkward ' ugly duckling ' whose daydreams of a glamorous white wedding are soundtracked by @entity159 music , the film was a surprise hit globally and launched the @entity162 career of @entity163 -- who has a role in " @entity3 "			1
@entity166 ( played by @entity163 ) tramps around in leopard skin inviting bitchy comments from her crass friends until she eventually plucks up the courage to head to the city			0
like " @entity99 " , it exposes the mean - spiritedness that can blight small town life -- in this case the small town in question is the kitschy fictional coastal setting of @entity131			0
as well as their camp credentials , one thing these films share in common is a reluctance to slip into stereotyped depictions of @entity6			1
questions of national identity are explored with more subtlety through a range of characters , and the image of the @entity6 bloke immortalised in the character of @entity61 is made to look a dated simplification			0
still , this onslaught of camp sometimes proves too much , even for some of the films ' characters			0
as @entity210 ( played by @entity11 ) tells her fellow drag queens at one point in " @entity57 " : " i 'll join this conversation on the proviso that we stop bitching about people , talking about wigs , dresses , bust sizes , penises , drugs , night clubs , and bloody @entity159 ! " to which @entity10 's character @entity214 snaps back : " does n't give us much to talk about then , does it ? "			0

" hey , hey it 's @entity3 " is the latest comedy film to come out of @entity6
like many successful @entity6 comedies it relies on a high dose of kitsch
films like " @entity99 " have *subverted* the macho @entity6 stereotype
" @entity7 " caused a storm on its release
