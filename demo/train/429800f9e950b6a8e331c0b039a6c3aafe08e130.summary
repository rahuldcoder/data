-- @entity1 is the man behind many of the most successful comic movies of recent years			1
@entity1 's latest comedy " @entity7 " pairs @entity5 ( left ) with @entity6 ( right )			1
as a producer @entity1 's resume reads like an encyclopedia of comedy hits : " anchorman , " " @entity13 , " " @entity14 , " " @entity15 , " " @entity16 " -- the list goes on			1
as a writer and director he is less prodigious , though his two efforts so far -- " the 40 - year - old virgin " and " @entity22 " -- have garnered commercial and critical success			2
his brand is about as hot as it gets in @entity27 comedy these days with his latest offering as director , " @entity7 " grabbing the highest share of the @entity27 box office with $ 23.4 million on its first weekend			1
the 41 - year - old @entity27 has an innate understanding of what makes people laugh			1
a former stand - up comic and writer for television sitcoms like " the @entity38 , " @entity1 has taken to heart that old maxim that the best comedy is born out of tragedy			1
" the 40 - year - old @entity20 , " for example , follows the painful attempts of a socially awkward nerd to lose his virginity , while " knocked up " is about a pregnancy resulting from a one - night stand			2
contrary to what its upbeat title might suggest , " @entity7 " delves into even darker territory			0
the movie stars @entity1 's former flatmate @entity5 as a famous comedian who is struck down with leukemia			1
" i see all the movies as dealing with my personal problems , whether it 's about virginity , bad sex , marital issues , unplanned pregnancy or , in the case of this one , death , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
part of the reason the @entity1 brand has grown so strong is his habit of collaborating with the same group of writers and performers			0
via his production company he has helped to foster the acting careers of @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity6			0
" when someone is really good i do n't want to let go of them , " he said			0
" every time we meet someone new and they 're great we think ' i want to use that person on the next one ' because it 's so hard to find someone that 's hysterical , interesting and fun to be around			0
" surprisingly , considering their longtime association , " @entity7 " is the first time @entity1 has helmed a feature with @entity5 in it			1
in the movie , which also stars the director 's wife @entity94 , @entity5 's character is prompted by illness to re-evaluate his life			2
this leads on a journey of self discovery that takes him back to his roots as a stand - up comic			1
to gather material for the movie @entity1 , @entity5 and co-star @entity6 followed a similar trajectory , going to comedy clubs together and , according to @entity1 " doing stand - up and bombing			1
" it was a nostalgic experience for @entity1 and @entity5 in particular , who shared an apartment in @entity112 when they were in their twenties and both struggling comedians trying to catch a break			2
" a little bit of the movie has some aspect of our repartee , " the director told @entity0			0
" but that was a different time			0
we were really young and hungry and trying to figure out how we were going to be accepted in the world of comics and movies			0
" it was very fun and exciting and we slept till noon everyday and had red lobster for lunch			0
so we always reminisce about that time because we had nothing going on other than our comedy sets at night			0
