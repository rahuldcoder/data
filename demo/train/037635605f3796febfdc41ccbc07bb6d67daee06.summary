-- the terrorist threat posed by radicalized @entity3 - @entity2 has been exaggerated , according to a study released wednesday by researchers at @entity6 and the @entity7 at @entity8			1
a small number of @entity3 - @entity2 have undergone radicalization since the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on @entity12 and @entity13 , the study found			1
it compiled a list of 139 individuals it categorized as " @entity2 terrorism offenders " who had become radicalized in the @entity20 in that time -- a rate of 17 per year			1
that level is " small compared to other violent crime in @entity20 , but not insignificant , " according to the study , titled " @entity25			0
" to be included on the list , an offender had to have been wanted , arrested , convicted or killed in connection with terrorism - related activities since 9/11 -- and have lived in the @entity20 , regardless of immigration status , for more than a year prior to arrest			2
of the 139 offenders , fewer than a third successfully executed a violent plan , according to a @entity6 statement on the study , and most of those were overseas			1
read the report : " @entity25 " " @entity2 organizations and the vast majority of individuals that we interviewed firmly reject the radical extremist ideology that justifies the use of violence to achieve political ends , " @entity37 , an associate professor in @entity6 's @entity38 and director of the @entity40 , said in the statement			1
in the aftermath of 9/11 , however , as well as terrorist attacks elsewhere in the world , the possible radicalization of @entity3 - @entity2 is a " key counterterrorism concern " -- magnified by heavy publicity that accompanies the arrests of @entity2 , such as that seen in the wake of the november shootings at @entity60 , @entity61 , in which 13 people were killed			1
@entity64 psychiatrist maj. @entity63 , a muslim born in @entity66 , is charged in connection with that incident			0
other high - profile incidents include the charging of eight @entity72 - @entity20 men on charges related to what authorities say are efforts to recruit youths from the @entity79 , @entity80 , area to fight for @entity81 , a @entity72 guerrilla movement battling the @entity85 country 's @entity83 - backed transitional government			0
at least two young men from @entity80 have been killed in @entity72 , including one who blew himself up in what is believed to have been the first suicide bombing carried out by a naturalized @entity20 citizen			0
in addition , five @entity2 were arrested last month in @entity92 , and police have said they are confident that they were planning terrorist attacks			0
a @entity92 court monday gave police two weeks to prepare their case against the five ; authorities have said they plan to prosecute the youths under the country 's anti-terrorism act			0
but it is the @entity2 communities themselves who play a large role in keeping the number of radicalized members low through their own practices , according to the study			2
leaders and @entity3 - @entity20 organizations denounce violent acts , for instance , in messages that have weight within communities			1
in addition , such communities often self - police -- confronting those who express radical ideology or support for terrorism and communicating concerns about radical individuals to authorities			0
some @entity3 - @entity2 have adopted programs for youth to help identify those who react inappropriately to controversial issues so they can undergo counseling and education , the researchers said			1
" @entity2 communities have been active in preventing radicalization , " said @entity133 , professor of sociology at @entity7 , in the statement			0
" this is one reason that @entity3 - @entity20 terrorism has resulted in fewer than three dozen of the 136,000 murders committed in the @entity20 since 9/11			1
" however , " since 9/11 , there has been increased tension among @entity3 - @entity2 about their acceptance in mainstream @entity20 society , " the study said			1
@entity3 - @entity2 report feeling a stronger @entity149 bias from the media as well as from day - to - day interactions			2
" while @entity3 - @entity2 understand and support the need for enhanced security and counterterrorism initiatives , they believe that some of these efforts are discriminatory , and they are angered that innocent @entity3 - @entity2 bear the brunt of the impact of these policies			2
" steps can be taken to minimize radicalization among @entity2 , the study said			0
the most important is encouraging political mobilization among @entity3 , which helps prevent radicalization and also demonstrates to @entity3 abroad " that grievances can be resolved through peaceful democratic means			0
" policymakers should include @entity3 - @entity2 in their outreach efforts , and public officials should attend events at mosques , as they do churches and synagogues , the study recommended			2
also , @entity3 - @entity20 communities should widely disseminate their condemnation of terrorism and violence , and those statements should be publicized , the study said			1
law enforcement has a role to play as well , by making efforts to increase the level of trust and communication with such communities			0
this could include the cultivation of @entity3 - @entity20 informants , the study suggested , a policy that could be developed and openly discussed with community leaders			2
governments can promote and encourage the building of strong @entity3 - @entity20 communities and promote outreach by social services agencies , the study said			1
" our research suggests that @entity3 - @entity20 communities desire collaboration and outreach with the government beyond law enforcement , in areas such as public health , education and transportation			1
" and the @entity2 community can promote enhanced education about its religion and beliefs , the study said			0
increased civil rights enforcement can also be an important tool			0
however , policies that alienate @entity3 may increase the threat of homegrown terrorism rather than reducing it , the study said			0
" our research suggests that initiatives that treat @entity3 - @entity2 as part of the solution to this problem are far more likely to be successful , " said @entity37			2
@entity37 , @entity133 and @entity220 , associate professor of religion at @entity6 , co-authored the study , which summarized two years of research involving interviews of more than 120 @entity3 in four different communities nationwide -- @entity225 , @entity13 ; @entity226 , @entity61 ; @entity227 , @entity12 ; and @entity228 , @entity229			1
the study was funded by a grant from the @entity232 .			0
