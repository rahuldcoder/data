@entity1 authorities on friday blocked access inside the country to the @entity5 and @entity1 websites of the @entity6 after they published an article reporting that family members of premier @entity9 had amassed a fortune worth billions of dollars			1
citing corporate and regulatory records , the @entity6 said it had pieced together evidence showing that @entity9 's relatives have controlled assets worth at least $ 2.7 billion , often hiding their names " behind layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends , work colleagues and business partners			1
" @entity1 reacted angrily to the report , preventing people inside the country from visiting the two @entity6 websites or searching for the terms " @entity6 " and " @entity9 " on popular social media platforms			1
big brother still watching : internet censorship on the up " it 's trying to blacken @entity1 's image and has ulterior motives , " @entity32 spokesman @entity31 said in a response to a question about the article , which mentioned @entity9 's son , daughter , younger brother and brother - in - law as being among those who had grown rich during @entity9 's time in power			1
asked about the decision to block the websites , @entity31 replied : " @entity1 regulates the internet in accordance with laws and regulations			0
" the @entity1 government tries aggressively to control the flow information inside its borders about sensitive topics like unrest in @entity58 areas and criticism of senior officials			0
it strictly manages the output of domestic news media outlets and has a history of shutting off access to international news websites			0
@entity1 authorities have blacked out the broadcast signal for international television stations like @entity70 and the @entity71 when they have aired sensitive reports about the country			0

opinion : new ' democracies ' failing if speech is n't free authorities have stepped up security in @entity91 , where the congress , part of a once - in - a - decade leadership transition , will take place			0
this transfer of power has already been complicated by the dramatic and damaging scandal involving the former high - flying official @entity99 and his inner circle			0
in a country where official corruption is widespread , the top leadership is particularly sensitive to suggestions that its members or those close to them have become unusually wealthy			1
the growing divide between rich and poor after two decades of torrid economic growth has added to that defensiveness			2
the @entity6 article on the wealth of @entity9 's relatives comes four months after @entity114 reported that the extended family of vice president @entity116 , the presumptive next top leader of @entity1 , had accumulated business interests worth hundreds of millions of dollars during his rise up the @entity85 ladder			1
@entity1 authorities cut off access to the @entity114 website following publication of the article , which was also based on public documents			0
the blocking of the @entity6 websites friday also takes place four months after the introduction of the chinese - language site , which the company said at the time was " intended to draw readers from the country 's growing middle class " through a mixture of reporting by @entity1 journalists and @entity6 articles translated from @entity5			1
the @entity6 cited a company spokeswoman as expressing disappointment friday that web access had been cut off			0
" we hope that full access is restored shortly , and we will ask the @entity1 authorities to ensure that our readers in @entity1 can continue to enjoy @entity6 journalism , " said @entity142 , according to @entity143			2
