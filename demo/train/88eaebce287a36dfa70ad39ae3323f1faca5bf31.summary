what is widely recognized as the most authoritative study of the @entity3 ' responses to mass killings around the world -- from the massacres of @entity7 by the @entity8 a century ago , to the @entity9 , to the more recent @entity11 atrocities against @entity13 muslims and the ethnic cleansing of the @entity15 in @entity16 -- concluded that they all shared unfortunate commonalities : " despite graphic media coverage , @entity3 policymakers , journalists and citizens are extremely slow to muster the imagination needed to reckon with evil			1
ahead of the killings , they assume rational actors will not inflict seemingly gratuitous violence			0
they trust in good - faith negotiations and traditional diplomacy			0
once the killings start , they assume that civilians who keep their head down will be left alone			0
they urge cease - fires and donate humanitarian aid			0
" this is an almost perfect description of how the @entity3 has acted over the past two years as it has tried to come up with some kind of policy to end the @entity42 regime 's brutal war on its own people in @entity44			1
the author who wrote the scathingly critical history of how the @entity3 has generally dithered in the face of genocide and mass killings went on to win a 2003 @entity50 for her book " a problem from @entity53 : @entity3 and the @entity54			1
" a decade after winning the @entity50 , that author is now the @entity3 ambassador to the @entity56			1
her name , of course , is @entity59 , and she is a longtime , close aide to president @entity62			2
she started working for @entity62 when he was a largely unknown junior senator from @entity63			0
@entity59 called her 610 - page study of genocide " @entity65 " because that 's how then - @entity3 secretary of state @entity68 referred to the @entity13 civil war and the unpalatable options available to the @entity3 in the early 1990s to halt the atrocities by the @entity11			1
one of the @entity3 officials that @entity73 took to task in her book is @entity77 who , as the senior @entity79 official responsible for @entity80 , did nothing in the face of the genocide unfolding in @entity16 in 1994			2
@entity84 is quoted in the book as suggesting during an interagency conference call that the public use of the word " genocide " to describe what was then going on in @entity16 while doing nothing to prevent it would be unwise and might negatively affect the @entity92 in upcoming congressional elections			0
@entity84 later told power she could not recall making this statement but also conceded that if she had made it , the statement was " completely inappropriate , as well as irrelevant			0
" @entity84 is now @entity62 's national security adviser			0
in 2012 , at @entity73 's urging , @entity62 announced the creation of an interagency task force to help stamp out atrocities around the world			0
called the @entity107 , it was led by @entity59 during its first year			2
meanwhile , the body count in @entity44 kept spiraling upward			2
for the past two years , @entity62 has n't wanted to intervene militarily in @entity44			1
who would ? the country is de facto breaking up into jihadist - run " emirates " and @entity114 rump states			0
it is also the scene of a proxy war that pits @entity119 affiliates backed by @entity120 and @entity121 against @entity122 , backed by @entity123			0
whoever ultimately prevails in this fight is hardly going to be an ally of the @entity3 it 's an ungodly mess that makes even @entity128 in 2006 look good			1
it is , in short , a problem from hell			0
power , @entity84 and @entity62 today face some of the very same unpalatable choices that have confronted other @entity3 national security officials as they tried to prevent mass killings in other distant , war - torn countries			2
they can continue to do little as the @entity44 civil war drags on into its third year with 100,000 dead and rising			2
it 's a state of affairs now compounded by the fact that the regime of president @entity42 appears not only to have crossed the " red line " with its use of chemical weapons but seems to have now sprinted past that line , killing hundreds with neurotoxins in a @entity147 suburb , according to @entity3 secretary of state @entity148			1
he 's blasted those attacks as something that " should shock the conscience of the world			0
it defies any code of morality			0
" opinion : how @entity161 used chemical weapons to poison debate on @entity44 doing nothing will not be treated kindly by future historians writing in the same vein as @entity73			2
the issue now in @entity44 is not simply that @entity42 is massacring his own civilians at an industrial rate , but he is also flagrantly flouting a well - established international norm by this regime 's reported large - scale use of neurotoxins as weapons against civilians			1
it seems inconceivable that the @entity3 as the guarantor of international order would not respond to this in some manner			1
but on what authority ? there is scant chance of a @entity56 resolution authorizing military action			2
when she was @entity56 ambassador , @entity84 skillfully ushered a resolution through the @entity188 that authorized military action in @entity190 in 2011			2
but @entity191 and @entity192 will almost certainly veto any similar kind of resolution on @entity44			2
@entity191 is one of @entity44 's few allies , and @entity191 and @entity192 are generally staunchly against any kind of international intervention in the affairs of other countries , no matter how egregious the behavior of those states might be			1
that leaves the possibility of some kind of unilateral action by the @entity3			0
the @entity3 regularly infringes the sovereignty of countries such as @entity209 and @entity210 with @entity212 drone strikes on the novel legal theory that terrorists planning strikes on the @entity3 are living in those nations and those countries are either unable or unwilling to take out the terrorists on their territory -- and therefore their sovereignty can be infringed by drone attacks			0
but making a claim that the @entity44 regime threatens the @entity3 is implausible , and therefore some kind of unilateral @entity3 action seems quite unlikely			1
in 1986 , the @entity228 administration launched air strikes at the homes of @entity190 dictator @entity231 , but only after an incident in which @entity190 agents had bombed a disco in @entity235 , killing two @entity3 servicemen			0
no such casus belli exists with @entity44 today			0
since neither a @entity56 authorized military mission nor a unilateral @entity3 strike seem likely , what options are left ? one appealing option could be something along the lines of the @entity245 model			1
the @entity246 in 1999 was entirely an air war in which no @entity3 soldiers were killed			0
the goal of the air campaign was to push @entity11 forces out of @entity245			0
@entity191 was allied with the @entity11 so , as in the @entity44 case today , there was no chance a @entity56 resolution authorizing force would pass			1
at the time @entity256 justified the @entity246 " to avert a humanitarian catastrophe			0
" on thursday , the @entity259 government released a similar statement saying that the grounds for military action against @entity44 " would be humanitarian intervention ; the aim is to relieve humanitarian suffering by deterring or disrupting the further use of chemical weapons			0
" but on thursday night the @entity259 parliament voted against authorizing military action -- a real setback for the @entity62 administration 's plan to assemble something of a coalition to participate in any forthcoming operation in @entity44			1
in the case of @entity245 , the war was conducted by @entity256 forces			0
@entity245 is , of course , in @entity280 , and @entity256 is a @entity280 - focused security alliance while @entity44 is the @entity282 , so @entity256 action there would be much more problematic			1
( a @entity256 force does fight in @entity286 today , but that is only because one of its member states , the @entity3 , was attacked on 9/11 from @entity286 by @entity119 , which triggered @entity256 's @entity291 , the right to collective self - defense of the members of the alliance			1
) if an air war were to be launched against @entity44 , one scenario could be that @entity8 , a member of @entity256 , could invoke @entity291 5 because @entity44 has fired into its territory on a regular basis			1
so far , @entity8 has proved reluctant to invoke @entity291 but the reported large - scale use of chemical weapons by the @entity42 regime might change the calculus of the @entity8			0
a further source of legitimacy for military action could be the strong statement tuesday by the @entity308 that the @entity42 regime is responsible for the " heinous crime " of using chemical weapons			1
the @entity308 is generally a toothless talking shop , which seemed to have surprised even itself two years back when it endorsed military action against @entity231			1
however , the @entity308 has not endorsed any military action against @entity42 , although some of its members have privately urged the @entity3 to take action against his regime in the past			1
it is hard to believe that some kind of military action against @entity44 wo n't now take place , likely in the form of @entity3 cruise missile attacks from ships in the @entity327			1
such attacks have the merit that they wo n't put @entity3 aircraft at risk , which could well encounter problems with @entity44 's reputedly formidable air defense systems			1
and the operation will likely have participation by @entity336 and a tacit green light from leading members of the @entity308 such as @entity121 , giving it a semblance of international legitimacy .			2

@entity59 's @entity50 winning study found @entity3 very slow to fight evil regimes
@entity345 : her work is a perfect description of @entity3 dithering on the @entity44 crisis
@entity3 is likely to strike @entity44 but lacks a strong basis in international *law* , he says
@entity356 : @entity56 wo n't support a strike , but @entity256 and @entity308 could back it
