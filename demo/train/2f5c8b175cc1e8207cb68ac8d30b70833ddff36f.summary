the flu has n't hit @entity1 as hard as it has the @entity2 , health officials say , but when and if it does , do n't expect a call for vaccination of the entire population			1
only the @entity2 and @entity7 actually encourage everyone older than 6 months to get the flu vaccine			1
apparently , not a single country in @entity1 asks the general population to seek that same kind of protection , according to @entity14 , the @entity15 technical officer in vaccine preventable diseases and immunizations in the organization 's @entity1 office in the @entity21			1
that 's because global health experts say the data are n't there yet to support this kind of blanket vaccination policy , nor is there enough money			2
in fact , some scientists say the enthusiasm for mass vaccination in the @entity2 may hurt efforts to create a better vaccine			1
this year , a year in which the vaccine is supposed to be a good match to the virus , the @entity35 estimates the vaccine is only 62 % effective			1
and in the segments of the population that are most susceptible to the extreme effects of the flu -- like the elderly , who make up the majority of the cases of flu - related deaths -- the vaccinations are even less effective			1
so is why is everyone urged to get vaccinated ? three things we do n't know about the flu simply put , it 's a clearer policy , and some protection is better than none at all , according to dr. @entity58 , the chair of the department of preventive medicine at @entity61			1
he was also on the national committee that made the decision to encourage everyone to get vaccinated			0
" it was debated by the @entity35 @entity67 for many years , and the indication for the use of influenza vaccine for an increasing number of groups on a piecemeal basis did n't make sense , " @entity58 said			2
in 2010 , the @entity35 expanded its guidance encouraging the vaccination of vulnerable population groups			0
" when you do the back - of - the - envelope calculations ( of all the separate groups recommended for vaccination ) , you are actually already making a recommendation that 75 % of the population get it , " @entity58 said			2
" and when it became apparent the issue of shortages was largely put on the back burner , then in 2010 , we said , ' let 's simplify this and recommended this vaccine for anyone over 6 months old			1
' " regulators approve new insect - based flu vaccine it also helps that the flu vaccine is easy to get , he said			1
companies sometimes bring in nurses to give shots to their employees on site			0
in @entity1 , only doctors are legally allowed to administer the vaccine , according to @entity107			2
there may be another economic reason for more @entity2 to get vaccinated -- one in three @entity2 workers get no paid time off when they are sick , according to the @entity111			1
generally , @entity1 have much more generous sick leave policies			0
" although flu can be unpleasant , if you are otherwise healthy , the illness will usually clear up on its own and you will recover within a week , " according to @entity118 's @entity117 website			1
homemade survival kits battle the flu in a contrast to @entity2 policy , the @entity15 recommends only six " priority populations " get " the flu jab , " as it 's called in @entity118			1
these six groups are nursing home residents , people with chronic medical conditions like asthma , the elderly , pregnant women , health care workers , and children from ages 6 months to 2 years , @entity14 said			0
they are more vulnerable to the severe effects of the flu or come into contact more often with this highly contagious virus			2
" we think the recommendations we have right now ( are ) a good start , " @entity14 said			0
" @entity142 campaigns are quite challenging and expensive			0
" we have 53 countries in our region that all have different recommendations based on different studies and evidence , and the depth of evidence in @entity1 right now is pretty limited in terms of flu vaccines			1
we would need more evidence that more than these six key , target high - risk groups that are prioritized can benefit			0
" online speculation says the @entity2 call for general vaccination is merely a plot by drug companies to make a big profit			1
flu vaccine poses no risk to unborn @entity165 says he hears that a lot , but it 's simply not true			1
" i have received e-mails after people hear me encourage people to get the influenza vaccine , and they tell me i 'm part of some sort of pharmacy company conspiracy and that i 'm compromised by them			2
but influenza vaccines are not real blockbuster money - making drugs , " @entity165 said			0
" if i could take some of these skeptics and bring them to the @entity67 meeting , they would see how carefully the members debate these issues -- and it really is all for the benefit of the children and adults to prevent infectious diseases			0
" influenza : by the numbers @entity189 , director of the @entity190 at the @entity191 , believes people should get the vaccine , but he worries that the current policy gives the impression the vaccine is more effective than it actually is			1
" this enthusiasm to get more people vaccinated gets in the way of a critical look at the science , " @entity189 said			2
@entity189 co-authored " the @entity202 for @entity203 , " which came out last october			0
it is an exhaustive study of this country 's vaccine war on flu			1
the authors examined more than 12,000 articles , studies and transcripts dating back to 1936 and interviewed 88 experts on the influenza vaccine			0
what they found was that there were some seasons in which the vaccination offers more protection than others , but ultimately , even in good years , the flu shot only offers moderate protection -- a " pooled estimate of 59 % for healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age , inconsistent evidence of protection in children age 2 to 17 years , and a paucity of evidence for protection in adults 65 years of age and older			2
" for the nasal spray form of the vaccine , there is evidence of high protection for children aged 6 months to 7 years , inconsistent evidence of protection in adults 60 years of age and older , and a lack of evidence of protection in individuals between 8 and 59 years of age , the study says			0
that analysis shows significantly less effectiveness than what has been the conventional wisdom within the scientific community , @entity189 said			0
" in promoting vaccination , it became a mantra that it was 70 to 90 % effective across all ages completely , and that was n't true , " @entity189 said			1
historically , this expansion in policy over who should get vaccinated was based on " professional judgment and not on scientifically sound data , " he said			0
had a flu shot ? you 'll be ok -- maybe @entity189 's study suggests this has been a general pattern in @entity2 public health history with relation to the flu vaccine			1
" there is a real downside to the promotion ( of the current flu vaccine ) , as it dampens serious investment and shuts down any real interest in start - ups to create a more effective vaccine , " @entity189 said			1
" there is a sense that a 59 % match is better than zero , but we would n't accept this with a disease like measles , which we seem to take more seriously			0
" the vaccine , however , is improving , according to @entity58			0
" researchers are trying to make a genuinely better vaccine , including a universal vaccine that could combat all the different strains of flu that we could get every 10 years , as opposed to needing one annually , " @entity58 said			2
" so cross your fingers			0
all of us wish we had a better vaccine			0
we know what we have is good , but not perfect			0
until we have one , we have to do as much good as possible by vaccinating as many people as possible -- and in the meantime i 'll be watching the universal vaccine trials very carefully			2
" @entity299 shot myths addressed			0

the @entity2 and @entity7 are the only countries to suggest vaccinating nearly everyone
this year 's flu vaccine is only 62 % effective .
some worry that enthusiasm for the vaccine stops *progress* on more effective ones
