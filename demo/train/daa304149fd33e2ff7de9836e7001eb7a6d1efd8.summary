-- more than 1 million babies born prematurely die each year before they are a month old , the @entity1 said sunday in the first comprehensive global report on premature births			1
a premature baby rests at a hospital in @entity7 , @entity8 , in october 2007			0
the organization suggested the situation could worsen if the rate of premature births increases			2
each year , 12.9 million infants -- or nearly 10 percent of the annual worldwide birth total -- are born before 37 weeks of development in the womb , the organization said			0
more than 85 percent of the premature births occur in developing countries in @entity18 and @entity19			1
" premature births are an enormous global problem that is exacting a huge toll emotionally , physically and financially on families , medical systems and economies , " @entity1 president @entity20 said in a statement			1
" in the @entity31 alone , the annual cost of caring for preterm babies and their associated health problems tops $ 26 billion			0
" the @entity1 report , which used data collected by the @entity35 , breaks down premature birth rates by continent			2
the highest premature birth rate is in @entity18 , where 11.9 percent of births each year are preterm , with more than 4 million premature deliveries annually			1
in populous @entity19 , although the preterm birth rate is lower at 9.1 percent , the number of premature births is higher , at nearly 7 million a year			1
while @entity47 -- consisting of the @entity31 and @entity48 in this report -- counts fewer than 500,000 premature births a year , its preterm birth rate is close to that of @entity18 , at 10.6 percent of all births , according to the report			1
the rate is the world 's second highest			2
in the @entity31 , the rate of preterm births has increased 36 percent in the past 25 years , with births between the 34th and 36th week of gestation accounting for the majority of the increase , the organization found			0
much of the hike in preterm births is linked to more pregnancies after the age of 35 and the use of fertility treatments that can lead to multiple births			0
" wherever trend data are available , rates of preterm birth are increasing , " the report said			0
infants who survive premature birth face lifelong health risks , including the possible development of cerebral palsy , blindness , hearing loss , learning disabilities and other chronic conditions , according to the @entity1			2
" preterm birth is a global problem that needs greater attention by policymakers , researchers , health care providers , the media , donor organizations and other stakeholders , " the report said			0
" the marked disparities in preterm birth along racial / ethnic lines in many high - income countries and the concentration of preterm births in @entity18 and @entity19 also clearly indicate that addressing preterm birth is essential for reducing the pronounced inequities in neonatal health and for the world to achieve , " it added			1
the @entity1 , a nonprofit agency engaged in pregnancy and baby health research , said some premature births can be prevented by addressing risk factors in mothers , including diabetes , high blood pressure , nutrition , body weight and tobacco and alcohol use			2
women who earlier gave birth to a preemie face a greater risk of having another			0
while doctors know some of the health and behavior factors in mothers that increase the risk of preterm births , doctors have yet to identify a reliable remedy to prevent early labor , said @entity129 , vice president for global programs of the @entity1			1
" while much can be done right now to reduce death and disability from preterm birth even in low - resource settings , we need to know more about the underlying causes of premature birth in order to develop effective prevention strategies , " @entity129 said .			0

@entity1 : nearly 10 percent of world 's births are premature
more than 85 percent of premature births are in developing parts of @entity18 , @entity19
