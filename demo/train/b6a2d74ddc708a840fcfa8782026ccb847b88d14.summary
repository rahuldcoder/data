-- it 's been a busy month for @entity2			1
his @entity4 movie " @entity5 " premiered saturday with him as attorney @entity6			1
on friday , @entity2 will tread familiar territory when his indie flick " @entity9 " hits theaters			1
the actor plays @entity12 , a cutthroat political strategist who 's trying to keep his candidates afloat amid self - sabotaging drama			1
@entity2 also can be seen weekly as sad - sack health nut @entity15 on @entity17 's " @entity20 , " which is shooting its fifth season			1
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity2 about his projects , his personal thoughts on the @entity24 trial , his dream of playing @entity26 and working with @entity27 on " @entity30 , " the story of @entity29			1
@entity0 : in " @entity5 , " you play @entity6 , the trial lawyer			1
from your perception , what was the biggest factor in why he lost ? @entity2 : it 's a little bit like why the @entity36 hit the iceberg			1
a bunch of little things had to go wrong for the big thing to go wrong			0
the one i focus on is the jury selection process itself			0
i think in many ways the trial was over before it began			1
this is the first big trial in the era of @entity49 and @entity50			1
not only does information move at the speed of light , but public opinion coalesces at the speed of light through social media			0
the point is to get a jury who has no opinion			0
but the thought that they have no opinion when it 's been all over social media , all over the public consciousness , all over cable news ... you have two types of people : either they have no opinion and have n't been living in the real world , and what does that say ? do you really want those people on a jury ? or you have people who have been paying somewhat attention and have heard leaked evidence , which is everywhere			1
personally , i think they overreached with charging her with first - degree , special - circumstances murder			0
@entity0 : what 's the mental state like of a person who 's tasked with prosecuting such a high - profile , nationwide murder case ? for the moment , he becomes a rock star for people who love prosecutions			1
@entity2 : people went to @entity94 just to be a part of this trial			1
it 's hard to imagine , but it 's true			2
people had t - shirts made that said " @entity104			0
" to the uninitiated in the realm of the public eye , that 's probably an unexpected complication that people deal with in different ways			2
@entity0 : the case was somewhat reminiscent of the @entity113 case in that it took on this sideshow circus element			0
@entity2 : the only difference that i would say -- and i 'd say it 's significant -- is unlike @entity113 , @entity6 seems to be the perfect man for the job			1
he 's 12 - for - 12 in death penalty cases			2
he 's the first guy to use @entity123			2
and yet it did n't happen , which makes it sort of @entity126 in a way			0
@entity0 : speaking of circuses , in " @entity9 , " you play @entity12 , a political strategist			1
do you have any empathy for people in these professions ? @entity2 : weirdly , i have nothing but empathy for people in those positions			1
i 've been fortunate enough -- or depending on your political views , unfortunate enough -- to come into contact with everybody from every spectrum , from @entity143 and @entity144 to @entity145			2
and at their core , they 're all real patriots			0
and they all really believe in what they perceive to be the greater good of our country			0
it 's not this jaded , cynical power play			1
that 's not my experience with those people			2
now , do they use jaded , cynical power - play tools ? absolutely			2
and that 's what my guy does in the movie			1
@entity0 : the film explores " damage control " as someone 's area of expertise			1
a hundred years ago , that notion would n't really exist			2
@entity2 : what appeals to me about it , is at its heart , it 's about communicating			1
how do you communicate when you 're going into a situation that 's already a train wreck ? when you look at @entity179 ( @entity180 ) or the football dude ( @entity181 ) -- is there a way to communicate their truth or lack of it in a way that brings a greater understanding ? i think it 's really fascinating			2
@entity0 : let 's talk about " @entity20			2
" is @entity15 going to find happiness ? @entity2 : @entity15 is absolutely beginning to finally find happiness			1
we 're a few more episodes down the pike than the audience has seen , and he 's going to have a -- as he 'd say " literally " -- a life - changing opportunity for growth , love and happiness			2
@entity0 : he 's become such the sad clown of @entity201 ( the show 's fictional town )			2
he 's become the happiest sad person on network television			2
he embraces life , even when he 's steering into a depressing skid			2
there 's a part of him that savors it in a way that i think is sort of sweet and weirdly inspiring			2
@entity0 : you 've worked with some comedic giants over the years			0
who on " @entity20 " do you learn the most about comedic deliveries these days ? @entity2 : i do n't even know where to begin			1
it 's murderer 's row			0
i 've worked with a lot of people and i 've come to realize that @entity223 ( @entity224 ) is , without a doubt , the most astute observer of human behavior that i have ever worked with			0
and has the quickest mind in terms of comedy and the sharpest sense of timing			0
i do n't think anyone comes close			0
then you have somebody like @entity237 , who i almost think is the funniest person on the show , who can also be a romantic lead movie star if he wants to			0
you 've got @entity241 ( @entity240 ) , who has mined such a specific voice for himself that resonates for so many people , that is unique only to him			0
you have @entity245 , who i believe could make @entity246 look like an amateur if given the opportunity			0
and i 'm a huge fan of @entity246 's			0
@entity245 's a crazy talented " voice of her generation " type writer			0
her movie " @entity253 " was amazing			0
it just goes on and on			0
@entity255 ? @entity256 is a once - in - a - lifetime character he 's created			0
@entity0 : it 's been reported that you 're working on a historical film , where you play @entity26			1
how far along is that ? @entity2 : it 's a big , expensive miniseries			1
@entity261 will be making it			0
i think the latest incarnation will be in conjunction with @entity266			0
it 's something i 've been attached to and wanting to do for a couple of years now			1
we 're still waiting for the final ok , and i 'm hoping it 's a project i 'd do on my hiatus , and it would be a dream project for me to play @entity26			1
he 's a very underserved @entity273 hero and complicated , dark , flawed			0
when he died , @entity273 gave him the largest public funeral this country had ever seen			0
i 'm hopeful that 'll happen			0
@entity0 : are you shooting anything else this year ? @entity2 : i have a movie coming out in may with @entity281 directing and @entity282 and @entity27 called " @entity30			1
" it 's the story of @entity29			0
@entity27 and i would sit on the set in our makeup and costume and be like , " dude , when people see us in this movie , it 's going to be the end for both of us			1
" it 's the most outrageous , over-the - top , hilarious , demented and yet weirdly realistic and sweet movie ever made			1
and , i might add , it 's so gay , it makes an average episode of " @entity301 " look like " @entity300			0
