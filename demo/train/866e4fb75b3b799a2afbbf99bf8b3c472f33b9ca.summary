-- in the years since its 1981 release , @entity4 's cabin - in - the - woods cheapie " @entity7 " has been elevated to the realm of myth			1
you wo n't find many films as near and dear to the hearts of horror nerds			1
the legacy is n't based on the fact that " @entity7 " had a great screenplay , because it did n't			1
in fact , the plot is as basic as they come : five college students drive out to a shack in the middle of nowhere , mess with an old reel - to - reel tape recorder that plays malevolent incantations , and unleash bloody @entity25 hell			1
the film 's effects were cut - rate even for the early ' 80s , and the acting ( other than a charismatic breakout turn by lantern - jawed b - movie icon @entity30 ) was amateurish at best			2
what made it a fright flick for the ages was its 22 - year - old wunderkind director 's dime - store ingenuity and gonzo wit			2
@entity4 jerry - rigged cameras onto two - by - fours and whipped them around like @entity41 on speed			0
his off - kilter angles gave the movie a weird , anxious energy			0
it was an eye - popping debut ... and a hard act for anyone to follow			0
a certain subset of genre purists and @entity52 subscribers already have their knives out for the remake			1
but they can put them away			0
the new " @entity61 " is not only made with an affectionate nod and a wink to the 1981 version , it 's also the bloodiest , goriest , slapstickiest horror movie since , well , " @entity7			1
" ' @entity64 ' exit : ' i want to do so much ' directed with gutsy promise by newcomer @entity68 ( and produced , and thus blessed , by @entity4 and @entity30 themselves ) , the update does n't mess with the original 's bare - bones formula too much			1
it barrels right into the familiar story , placing five old pals in a run - down cabin , having them discover an old book filled with demonic illustrations and harrowing warnings , and once again releasing the gruesome genie from the bottle			2
other than " @entity88 's " @entity82 , the cast is n't weighed down by too many familiar faces , which seems right since these are pretty much interchangeable folks lining up for the body count			1
and what a juicy , splattery body count it is			0
in " @entity61 " , blood sprays in arterial geysers like the fountains outside the @entity93 in @entity94			1
one possessed character licks a box cutter , butterflying her tongue in half			0
another has rats pouring out of her mouth like clowns piling out of a @entity105			0
eyes are stabbed with hypodermic needles , limbs are severed with electric carving knives , and chain saws do what chain saws do			2
did i mention it 's a comedy ? ' @entity64 ' : singer exiting tonight is ... some will have a hard time seeing it that way , i know			2
the audience i saw it with screamed , gasped , and buried their faces in their dates ' necks			2
but horror films and tv shows such as @entity126 are like a foreign language			0
either they speak to you or they do n't			0
the new " @entity61 's " delirious gross - out scenes spoke to me , and they go further than any mainstream picture i can think of			1
how a movie this graphic and gooey managed to finagle an r rating is a mystery			0
but i 'm not complaining			0
as a diehard fan of the original and the genre , who am i to look such a wonderfully stomach - turning gift horse in the mouth ? b + see the original article at @entity0			1
