cancer cases are expected to surge 57 % worldwide in the next 20 years , an imminent " human disaster " that will require a renewed focus on prevention to combat , according to the @entity5			1
the @entity6 , produced by the @entity5 's specialized cancer agency and released on @entity8 , predicts new cancer cases will rise from an estimated 14 million annually in 2012 to 22 million within two decades			1
over the same period , cancer deaths are predicted to rise from 8.2 million a year to 13 million			1
the rising incidence of cancer , brought about chiefly by growing , aging populations worldwide , will require a heavier focus on preventive public health policies , said @entity16 , director of the @entity17			1
" we can not treat our way out of the cancer problem , " he said			2
" more commitment to prevention and early detection is desperately needed in order to complement improved treatments and address the alarming rise in cancer burden globally			2
" the report notes that the rocketing cost of responding to the " cancer burden " -- in 2010 , the economic cost of the disease worldwide was estimated at $ 1.16 trillion -- is hurting the economies of rich countries and beyond the means of poor ones			1
the report said about half of all cancers were preventable and could have been avoided if current medical knowledge was acted upon			2
the disease could be tackled by addressing lifestyle factors , such as smoking , alcohol consumption , diet and exercise ; adopting screening programs ; or , in the case of infection - triggered cancers such as cervical and liver cancers , through vaccines			0
" i know the report said we ca n't treat our way out of ( the cancer problem ) but there are major things we can do , " said dr. @entity52 who works in oncology at @entity54 in @entity55			2
" virtually 80 or 90 percent of lung cancers are caused by smoking			0
i know stopping smoking is not easy for people , but it does seem like a pretty simple way to reduce the numbers			0
" " the cancer rates are not going up for shocking reasons , but for reasons that are easier to understand , and if we improve overall health , there are things we can do to prevent this from happening , " @entity52 said			0
cutting smoking rates would have a significant impact , as lung cancer remained the most commonly diagnosed cancer ( 1.8 million cases a year , or 13 % of total cancer diagnoses ) and the deadliest , accounting for about one - fifth ( 1.6 million ) of all cancer deaths worldwide			1
there is a silver lining to the report , some experts said : it may lend urgency to the fight against cancer			2
countries such as the @entity91 present examples of success stories stemming from legislation and financial resources devoted to cancer prevention			1
" the good news is , in ( the @entity91 ) , cancer mortality is trending downward , and that would be more true if you make an age adjustment , " said dr. @entity96 , chairman of the @entity97 at @entity99 's @entity98 in @entity100			0
" since we have an aging population , the cancer rate increases , and if you adjust for the aging of @entity112 , the cancer rate is declining notably			0
" @entity96 said a typical 20 - year - old @entity91 who does n't smoke , " who has a good diet and a healthy lifestyle , someone with moderate alcohol consumption and who takes preventive health measures like regularly seeing a doctor and getting exercise -- their chance of cancer is significantly less than someone who for example lives in a developing country in @entity128 right now			1
" however , the @entity91 is dealing with an obesity epidemic -- the rates of adults who are considered obese has doubled since the 1970s -- and drinking excessively is still the @entity133 cause of lifestyle - related death			0
smoking is still the leading cause of preventable death in the @entity91			0
however , when the @entity91 surgeon general linked tobacco to lung cancer 50 years ago , more than 40 % of the adult population smoked ; now it 's about 19 %			1
public health initiatives have also made a difference in smoking rates			0
the report eventually spurred local governments to make it harder for a smoker to find a place to practice their habit			0
many restaurants , bars , and even public parks ban smoking			0
national leadership gave state governments license to raise taxes on cigarettes so much that people quit because they could no longer afford their habit			0
money from the federal tobacco lawsuit settlement went into smoking cessation programs and gave farmers incentives to grow crops other than tobacco			0
the @entity169 banned persuasive cigarette ads that may have encouraged young people to smoke			0
smoking rates remain high in @entity173 and @entity128			0
@entity174 -- where one - third of the world 's cigarettes are smoked , according to the @entity5 -- only recently moved to ban indoor public smoking			2
the report 's authors suggested governments take similar legislative approaches to those they had taken against tobacco in attempting to reduce consumption of alcohol and sugary drinks , and in limiting exposure to occupational and environmental carcinogens , including air pollution			0
according to the report , the next two most common diagnoses were for breast ( 1.7 million , 11.9 % ) and large bowel cancer ( 1.4 million , 9.7 % )			2
liver ( 800,000 or 9.1 % ) and stomach cancer ( 700,000 or 8.8 % ) were responsible for the most deaths after lung cancer			2
" the rise of cancer worldwide is a major obstacle to human development and well - being , " said @entity16 , the @entity17 director			1
" these new figures and projections send a strong signal that immediate action is needed to confront this human disaster , which touches every community worldwide			0
" the report said the growing cancer burden would disproportionately hit developing countries -- which had the least resources to deal with the problem -- due to their populations growing , living longer and becoming increasingly susceptible to cancers associated with industrialized lifestyles			1
more than 60 % of the world 's cases and about 70 % of the world 's cancer deaths occurred in @entity128 , @entity173 , and @entity222 and @entity112			1
" in the developing world , we are really at the beginning of understanding how serious the cancer problem is in these countries , " said @entity223			1
cancers related to the @entity230 epidemic in developing countries and the spread of @entity232 are also on the rise , but so too is the general age of the population in developing counties			1
when you now have the potential to live long enough to see your grandchildren -- something that was not true even a decade ago in many developing countries -- your risk of having cancer is going to go up			1
" when life expectancy get better , cancer rates will go up and so will cancer fatalities , " @entity96 said			0
governments needed to appreciate that screening and early detection programs were " an investment rather than a cost , " said @entity252 , co-editor of the report -- and low - tech approaches had proven successful in some developing countries			1
the @entity6 , which is published about once every five years , involved a collaboration of around 250 scientists from more than 40 countries			1

cancer is preventable , if resources are dedicated to fighting it , experts say
new cases of cancer are *tipped* to rise 57 % worldwide in 20 years , says the @entity5
@entity6 says developing countries will be disproportionately hit
even rich countries will struggle to deal with the *spiraling* costs of treatment
