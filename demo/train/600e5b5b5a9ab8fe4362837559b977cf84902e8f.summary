@entity0 -- the devastation wrought by @entity3 along the @entity5 coast was fresh in @entity7 's mind when he met with sen. @entity8 and other members of the congressional delegation about aid in 2005			1
" my first trip to @entity0 after @entity3 , senator @entity8 said , ' you tell me what the state needs and i 'll try to get it , ' " @entity7 told @entity1			1
" he never deviated from that and ultimately he succeeded			0
" @entity8 did it , @entity7 and political observers said , by employing the same sort of quiet , persistence that has marked his 36 - year tenure in the @entity23			1
he worked behind the scenes , talking with colleagues , negotiating and eventually he was able to net $ 29 billion in relief money			0
he also worked across the aisle with @entity28 sen. @entity28 of @entity29 to reform the law governing federal disaster relief policies aimed at helping communities recover			0
their efforts helped ensure that the victims of broad devastation , such as the type seen after @entity3 and @entity38 in 2012 , could get aid for housing and rebuilding			0
" in our time of greatest need , he was the giant in the delegation for @entity5 , " @entity7 said			1
now , one of the longest serving lawmakers in @entity49 is facing a very different type of storm			0
@entity8 is a septuagenarian facing a serious challenge from arch - conservative @entity53 , a state senator who is about half his age and has the grassroots support of the tea party , the @entity57 and @entity58			1
the veteran lawmaker and his challenger both failed to eclipse the 50 % threshold in the june 3 primary to avoid a runoff and will face off again on tuesday			1
@entity65 primary heads for runoff the stakes are especially high in @entity5 as the tea party reels from @entity70 primary setbacks in @entity71 and other states this spring			1
conservatives are hoping to oust another " establishment " @entity70			0
they are buoyed by @entity78 primary 's surprise defeat of @entity80 majority leader @entity79 by political newcomer , @entity81			2
in @entity5 , the race leading up to the runoff turned ugly			1
this month , police arrested political blogger @entity85 after authorities said he broke into a nursing home where @entity8 's wife , @entity88 , has lived for roughly 14 years and snapped pictures of the elderly woman which ended up in a political attack ad on @entity93 , according to @entity94			1
both @entity8 and @entity53 denounced the act , but the fallout has led to accusations of dirty politics through attack ads. @entity101 's arrest shakes up @entity5 @entity70 primary " i think senator @entity8 is generally viewed positively by the electorate as a whole , " said @entity103 , chairman of the @entity105 's political science department			1
" however , among those voters who are likely to take part in the @entity70 primary , his numbers are not as high			0
" though the @entity112 and the @entity113 both have the senate seat as remaining solidly in the @entity70 column , @entity113 in april wrote : " @entity8 , 76 , is in trouble â € ” in deep trouble â € ” primarily because of changes in the @entity70			2
but it 's also true that the senator , and his campaign , did n't start his re-election effort where they needed to be			2
" complete coverage : 2014 midterm elections that 's partly because the very thing @entity8 has cited as a strength : his tenure in @entity0 and power broker status , has been used by his tea party backed opponent to paint him as an antiquated @entity134 insider			1
in 2010 , @entity135 , a non profit government spending watchdog group , dubbed @entity8 the " king of earmarks " after he netted roughly $ 490 million for projects he favored			2
@entity8 has served as the chairman of the @entity140 and the @entity141			2
in this role , he was able to help net federal funding for his alma mater , the @entity105 , for medical research , as well as money for defense contractors and protected the interests of @entity5 farmers , @entity7 said			2
" he has worked hard in the state to make sure @entity5 got its fair share , " @entity7 said			2
@entity7 's nephew , @entity152 , is an adviser to @entity5 conservatives , a super pac that is trying to get @entity8 re-elected			1
still , the challenge from @entity53 has @entity8 on the defense , @entity103 said			2
" i think @entity53 's campaign is a little bit of tea party , a little bit of personal attacks , and a little bit of ambition on @entity53 's part , " @entity103 said			0
" the mystery going forward is the magnitude of any impact from the photos of the senator 's ailing wife			1
" short - lived @entity159 victories ? the race 's tenor seems a departure for someone who , friends like @entity7 said , prides himself on being " a true gentleman			0
" " he is a true gentleman			0
he is gracious , never says anything bad about anybody , " @entity7 said			0
" he is a quiet , but very able colleague			0
he 's always been held in very high regard by people in both parties			0
" @entity8 's mother was a school teacher ; his father was a principal			1
this educationally steeped environment helped shaped his core values , the lawmaker has told the media over the years			0
though he was a high school football star in @entity192 , @entity5 , he decided to join the cheerleading squad at the @entity105 â € ” an experience he credits with his first taste of politics			0
key races to watch in 2014 " you had to go around to the different residence houses and fraternity and sorority houses and campaign , answer questions and make a little speech about why you thought you 'd be a good cheerleader , " @entity8 told @entity198 in 2011			1
fellow @entity5 @entity70 and former sen. @entity206 was also an @entity207 cheerleader a few years after @entity8			1
@entity8 followed his cheerleading stint with service in the @entity210			0
he earned a law degree , practiced and also headed @entity213 's 1968 campaign in @entity5			1
@entity8 was elected to the @entity80 in 1972 , serving three terms before moving on to the @entity23			0
" i think he 's a pragmatic politician that understands getting a half a loaf most of the time is better than never getting anything while you hold out for a whole loaf , " @entity103 said .			0
