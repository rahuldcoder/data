you are the one hitting the shots , but the man standing over your shoulder could hold the key to your golfing destiny			2
a caddie can often be dismissed as just an accessory whose sole role is to lump a golfer 's clubs round the course and occasionally throw a few speculative blades of grass into the wind			1
but new research by a leading university suggests a caddie could prove the difference between success and failure			1
so when the world 's best golfers line up for 2014 's final major at the @entity24 , take a moment to study the person by their side			1
in 2007 my caddie @entity30 won me the @entity31 , " said three - time major champion @entity29			1
the @entity32 , who won the @entity24 in 2008 , had a one - shot lead coming down the 18th at @entity34 in @entity35 as he battled to claim his first major back in 2007			1
but then the nerves took over			0
" i hit my tee shot in the water on 18 and was despondent , i then hit my third shot into the water again and felt like i 'd lost , " he explained			0
" i had to walk about 150 yards for my next shot and @entity30 was talking to me , coming out with all the cliches about what to do next			1
" for the first 50 yards i wanted to strangle him , for the next 50 yards i started listening to him and for the last 50 yards i believed him			0
" i was in the zone , then out of it and then back in it again -- that really does n't happen very often			0
" in that moment of time i do believe @entity30 made the difference -- with any other caddie i would have thought i had lost but my caddie believed in me			1
" it 's all about creating your own reality when you 're on the golf course			1
" @entity29 's recovery from that double blow secured a playoff with @entity63 that he would go on to win , and the 42 - year - old retained his @entity66 @entity31 crown the following year			1
his relationship with @entity30 was critical in that glut of success , underlined by a pair of @entity72 videos to support the study in which @entity29 's caddie helped him hole a shot from 150 yards while blindfolded			1
that was part of the research commissioned by @entity79 and carried out by @entity80 , which says a good caddie can boost a golfer 's performance by 30 % or more			1
according to dr @entity85 , the director of research degrees at @entity86 , the axis between player and caddie must be built around four central pillars			1
first is closeness , including trust and respect , commitment , being complementary as well as open and co-orientation , which hinges on shared knowledge and understanding			1
those qualities are , of course , allied to the nuts and bolts of the job			0
any caddie must know the game and their employer inside out , study the course and the wind conditions , have food and water available , as well as be able to tell the odd joke here and there			1
but fundamentally , according to the top players , you just need someone you get on with			0
blog : @entity119 fulfills his destiny " we 're like brothers , brothers that @entity128 left alone -- and they left him in charge , " @entity121 previously told @entity122 of his relationship with two - time masters champion @entity124			2
" sometimes i just want to punch him , but i love him			0
and i know he feels the same about me			0
but do n't let anybody else say anything bad about us			0
we 'll go into battle for each other			0
" @entity124 notoriously wears his heart on his sleeve while out on the course , and his maverick approach to the game often sees him attempt shots other pros would n't even contemplate			0
a case in point is the shot that set up his first @entity149 victory in 2012 , as he somehow managed to maneuver the ball onto the green from a position deep in the trees of @entity155 's 10th hole during a playoff with @entity157			2
so how does @entity121 keep @entity124 's emotions in check ? " it takes a long time to learn someone			2
and that 's the art of caddieing -- you have to learn your player , " @entity121 says			2
" for @entity124 it 's about keeping him in the middle emotionally			2
" you do n't want him to get too excited , or too mad			0
it 's about trying to watch him and getting back to that middle point where he plays his best			2
" one of the most potent player - caddie relationships of recent times was between @entity171 and @entity172			1
the @entity173 was on the bag for all but one of @entity171 ' 14 major titles , and the 38 - year - old has n't claimed another since they parted ways			1
@entity172 is now right hand man for @entity181 @entity180 , who grabbed his first major title at @entity149 in 2013 , fulfilling years of potential			1
" if caddies are just carrying the bag , then players would just hire a local caddie , " @entity172 told the @entity184			1
" every player requires different things -- the most important role is basically getting your man around the course best you can			2
" you have to have the best understanding of the course all the time so you can try to prevent errors			0
" there are always going to be errors , but caddies can give the right information and prevent a lot of errors			0
but we all know the player hits the shots			0
" the ultimate pressure might be on the player , but there are a few examples of a caddie only adding to their stress levels			2
@entity211 was caddying for 1991 @entity212 champion @entity212 at the @entity31 in 2001 when he realized he had 15 clubs in the bag rather than the permitted 14			1
@entity212 , who was in contention for the title at the time and eventually finished third , hurled the offending club into the rough when @entity211 informed him of the error and sacked him a few weeks later			0
thankfully , there were no such dramas this time round			0
playing in his first major championship during this year 's tournament at @entity225 was home favorite @entity226			1
the factory resin worker thought his chances of a pro career had vanished after injury curtailed his progress as a youngster but took his place at @entity235 through a qualifying tournament -- a victory he put down in large part to assistance from his caddy @entity240			0
" he 's the reason i was at @entity31			1
he did a top notch job when i qualified , " @entity226 told @entity122 , prior to teeing off at @entity235			0
" he knows it 's an emotional week for me , he 's fantastic at controlling my emotions -- that 's his main job			2
" if i hit a bad shot it is my responsibility because i 'm the one who hit it			0
if we 're not sure what shot to hit we talk it out until we are happy with it			0
that builds trust really quickly			0
