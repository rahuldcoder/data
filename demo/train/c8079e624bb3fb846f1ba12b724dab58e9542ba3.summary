-- thanks to the age - old art of bartering , a @entity2 teenager became the envy of all his friends when he pulled into school in a @entity10 convertible			2
@entity11 , 17 , dreamed of one day owning a luxury sports car -- a dream that became reality after he posted a used cell phone on @entity16			1
" my friend gave me a free phone and said , ' do what you want with it , ' " @entity11 told @entity0 's " @entity22 " thursday			1
" so i put it on @entity16 on the barter section			1
" after some serious patience , research and a lot of talking , his cell phone trade landed him an @entity29 , which he managed to barter up for a dirt bike and then to a @entity32 laptop computer			1
before long , he was the proud owner of an 1987 @entity33			0
eventually , he landed a classic @entity34 -- the golden ticket that would soon get him into the driver seat of a luxury sports car			0
" i just went for it , " he said			0
" i knew the @entity38 was worth more at the end			0
" so what 's his secret ? " it 's trying to catch people who want what you have , " @entity11 said			1
" the man that needed the laptop had an extra car , " so both parties got what they wanted , he added			0
he advises anyone looking to get into the barter game to be cautious before committing to a trade			0
" always inspect everything , " @entity11 said			2
although he accomplished his goal of owning a @entity10 , @entity11 says it 's time to move on and he plans on going back to what he does best -- bartering for something else			1
" i do n't have a job right now and i really do n't like asking my parents if i can get an oil change , so i want to trade [ the @entity10 ] for a mid-sized truck , " @entity11 said			2
" we 'll see what comes along			0
