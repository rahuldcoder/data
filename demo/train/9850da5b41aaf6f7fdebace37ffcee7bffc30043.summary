-- with a twinkle in his eye and a gentle smile under the wide brim of a black cowboy hat , @entity1 is still out on the road charming country music fans of all ages			1
but beyond performing the hits like " @entity11 " and " @entity14 , " his music now has a mission			2
@entity1 makes time out on the road these days for greeting very special fans -- families and children suffering from @entity20 syndrome			1
the rare disease is something @entity1 and his family are all too familiar with			1
" my niece @entity26 , my brother @entity24 's daughter , was afflicted with and lost her battle with it at age 16 , " @entity1 said			1
@entity20 syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the way the brain develops			1
it is almost exclusively found in girls			2
according to @entity35 from the @entity36 , @entity20 's is on the far end of the autism spectrum and is a mutation of the x chromosome , which is why it mostly affects girls			1
" essentially , something is happening in the human body where the brain and the nerve endings are n't making that connection			0
so that affects their breathing , that affects how they use their hands , that affects all kinds of communication things			2
you see all these girls who want to communicate and they probably are communicating but we are n't paying attention in the way we should be paying attention			1
but also they 'll have seizures			0
they often wo n't be able to walk , so it manifests itself in different ways			0
so for some women and girls it can be very severe and lead to death			2
you know ( it has a ) 20 % mortality rate but other times it can express itself very mildly , " said @entity35			0
unfortunately for the @entity74 , @entity1 's niece fell into the 20th percentile			1
but he felt that this tragedy was a call to action			0
" i never really knew what i could do , but once i saw my brother trying to help and doing some fundraising , i got involved and we started holding annual golf tournaments and concerts and i went on " apprentice " and raised $ 20,000 , " @entity1 said			1
while competing on " @entity84 , " fellow contestant @entity85 vowed to help @entity1 raise more money			1
" he acquired a grant from the @entity88 for a million dollars -- a matching grant			0
so we raised our million and the @entity88 matched it and then some , " @entity1 continued			2
@entity1 now serves as the honorary chairperson for the research to reality campaign for the @entity36			2
he 's the face of the campaign , but the music star is rather humble about his influence			2
" i do n't want to pretend i 'm doing a great deal , you know i try to bring attention to it			0
i do these fundraising events			0
there 's so many people working so much harder behind the scenes and i really even personally have no idea -- i have a sense -- of how much goes into it			2
" but @entity35 said he feels very differently about @entity1 's contribution toward finding a cure			1
" @entity20 syndrome is a rare disorder and because of that , a lot of people have never heard of it			1
and that 's a challenge for us , " @entity35 said			2
" so when someone like @entity1 comes along and who is willing to take something that is honestly really private and painful for their family , and to have the courage to come public about that , and be an advocate for us , and talk about our progress , and talk about the hope that we have -- that 's very encouraging			1
" @entity35 continued , " our hope is it ( @entity20 's ) will become a household name ... so we 'll be able to spot someone with @entity20 syndrome and direct them to help			1
" @entity35 said a lot of assistance is available for girls with @entity20 's , and @entity1 's help is measurable because " more people are giving and more research is possible because of that , and that gives a lot of hope to a lot of families			1
" these women and girls , who @entity1 calls " @entity147 , " lack the ability to communicate verbally , so he is devoted to raising his voice for them			1
" i think the human , knee - jerk reaction is to look away			0
because it 's really hard to see ... but the more i see , the more i see the families and how hard they fight , the more i realize we , we ca n't look away , we have to look			0
" " and i tell myself when i 'm looking at these children that these are the divine among us			0
they 're the ones that have been given the hardest paths			0
and so i feel like it 's a real privilege for me to come in contact with them			0
and that 's how i deal with it emotionally			0
" " i remember seeing an interview with someone a long time ago who had a near - death experience , and said she had been visited by angels , " @entity1 said			1
" and she was told that those with the hardest paths are the most divine			0
that they chose the hardest paths to help those around them			0
so that stuck with me			0
so when i 'm meeting a family who 's really suffering with this and see the child , that 's the perspective i choose to have			0
