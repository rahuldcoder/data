@entity0 -- outside a @entity5 mosque where the imam preaches against terrorism , the brothers of the " @entity3 " are spreading a different message			1
protected by the @entity11 of the country they detest , radical @entity3 converts like @entity3 and @entity10 preach that the killing of @entity16 troops overseas is justified			1
in their thinking , so were the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity16 -- and so are attacks on almost any @entity16			1
" @entity16 will always be a target -- and a legitimate target -- until @entity16 changes its nature in the international arena , " @entity10 said in an interview to air on tonight 's " @entity21			1
" @entity26 and @entity10 consider @entity29 leader @entity28 their model			2
" i love him like i ca n't begin to tell you , because he does n't seem to have done anything wrong from the sharia , " @entity30 said , referring to @entity32 law			2
" if you 're asking me if i love him as a @entity3 , i love him more than i love myself			1
" they hand out fliers outside the gleaming 96th street mosque , where up to 4,000 people visit every day			1
inside the sleek , modernistic house of worship , @entity42 preaches against the violence that now sweeps many @entity3 countries			1
" what we try to do is reminding our people about the real @entity32 , " @entity42 said			2
" we tell them what the real @entity32 is all about			2
@entity32 is opposed to any kind of hatred against anybody			2
" law enforcement sources have told @entity1 the men walk right up to the line of protection under the @entity62 , but their message is not going unnoticed			1
@entity26 handed @entity1 correspondent @entity64 a business card from an @entity67 agent who he says is keeping tabs on him			2
the agent would not comment without clearance from his superiors , except to say , " obviously , if they gave you my card , you know we are watching them			0
" the mosque has called police on @entity26 and @entity10 several times , and passers - by occasionally engage them in heated debates			1
@entity42 told @entity1 that ordinary @entity82 are " disgusted with their behavior			0
" but they insist they do n't fight themselves , and do n't incite others to do so			0
@entity26 calls president @entity87 " a murderer , a tyrant , a scumbag , " and says he would n't " shed a tear " if @entity87 were killed			0
but he added , " would i incite his murder ? that 's not what i teach			0
" @entity10 calls himself an @entity16 " by default " who identifies with @entity82			1
@entity26 , a jew who lived in @entity96 before converting to @entity32 , says he " would like to see a mushroom cloud " over the jewish state -- " but before that , i 'd like to see the people guided , and i 'd like them to go back to their original countries where they 're from			0
" but federal agents are not only watching them , they 're watching some of those who are listening			0
@entity105 , a young @entity0 who has pleaded guilty to plotting to attack trains on the @entity107 , met with @entity30			1
@entity26 said @entity105 and " some brothers " traveled to @entity109 , @entity110 , and had dinner with him			0
@entity26 said they considered him something of a hero because he left @entity96 and converted to @entity32			0
@entity115 also claims friendships with @entity117 , now under indictment in @entity119 , @entity120 , on charges of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists , and @entity125 , who pleaded guilty before a federal judge in @entity127 to receiving military training from @entity32 militants in @entity130			0
@entity10 says he and his fellow radicals are " commanded to terrorize the disbelievers ... making them fearful so that they will think twice before they go rape your mother or kill your brother or go onto your land and try to steal your resources			0
" " we are defending innocent women that are bombed every day , innocent children that are bombed every day , " he said			0
but asked whether those who take their fliers should take up arms against @entity16 , he said , " we certainly have never said that			1
" @entity1 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
