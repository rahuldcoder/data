-- the former director general of the @entity2 , in a letter to a @entity5 lawmaker , tried to explain what he knew about a journalistic investigation into claims of abuse by @entity10 , a late children 's tv presenter			1
a slew of sexual abuse allegations against @entity10 , a @entity2 star and household name in @entity5 , have emerged over the past month			1
a second scandal broke with the news that the @entity2 show " @entity18 " had been investigating similar allegations but dropped the case in late 2011			1
this week , @entity20 , who was director general of the @entity2 at the time of the " @entity18 " investigation , provided apparently conflicting statements on what he knew about the allegations and when			1
how celebrity child sex scandal has rocked the @entity2 " i was not notified or briefed about the ' @entity18 ' investigation , nor was i involved in any way in the decision not to complete and air the investigation , " @entity20 said in a statement monday			1
" during my time as director general of the @entity2 , i never heard any allegations or received any complaints about @entity10			1
" on tuesday , an account published in the @entity35 quoted @entity20 as saying that a @entity2 reporter told him about the investigation at a party in december			1
@entity20 is now the incoming chief executive at the @entity35			1
questioned by @entity5 mp @entity39 , @entity20 offered an explanation in a letter that attempted to reconcile his two statements			1
he explained that he learned of the investigation but not its details and was satisfied when he inquired to his senior management and was told that it had been dropped for journalistic reasons			0
" i was never formally notified about the ' @entity18 ' investigation and was not briefed about the allegations they were examining and to what extent , if at all , those allegations related to @entity10 's work at the @entity2 , " @entity20 wrote in the letter , dated tuesday			1
late @entity2 tv presenter accused of sex abuse when he learned of " @entity18 's " investigation and was told it was dropped , he did not question it , because such decisions are common , he said			2
he added that he finds the bevy of sexual abuse allegations against @entity62 " exceptionally grave			2
" " i have been appalled by what i have read and heard in recent weeks and can only imagine the sufferings that these crimes have caused to the victims , " he wrote			0
the public editor of the @entity35 , @entity67 , wrote that the scandal is enough for the company to think about the baggage he is bringing to @entity71			2
" his integrity and decision - making are bound to affect the @entity35 and its journalism -- profoundly			0
it 's worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job , given this turn of events , " she wrote wednesday			0
the scandal has gripped the @entity5 media , with many questioning who knew what and when about the alleged abuse of young teenage girls , and it threatens lasting damage to the reputation of the @entity5 's public broadcaster			2
@entity10 died in october last year at the age of 84			0
@entity92 's @entity91 last week launched a criminal investigation into claims of child sexual abuse by " @entity10 and others , " many of which date back to the 1960s and ' 70s			0
the force said that more than 200 potential victims had been identified			0
the @entity2 said monday that the editor of " @entity18 " was " stepping aside " over questions about why his show never broadcast its investigation into @entity62			1
the furor has shocked a generation in @entity5 who grew up watching @entity10 , one of the most recognizable figures in @entity5 showbiz from the 1960s to the 1980s , or listening to his radio shows			0
he was the first host of the @entity2 's hugely popular " @entity113 " music show , and his own program , " @entity117 'll fix it , " ran for almost 20 years			2
thousands of children wrote in every week with special requests for him to " fix , " or make happen			0
the controversy has prompted a wider examination of an apparent culture of sexism at the @entity2 in past decades that may have fed into abusive behavior			2
the allegations against the famous @entity10 are a reminder of how little the public really knows about celebrities , said @entity130 , director of the @entity131 for @entity132 and @entity133 at @entity134			0
" it 's another one of these instances that shows us whenever there 's someplace we think we wo n't see scandal , eventually , we end up seeing it , " he said			0
the scandal brings the venerable @entity2 into question and feeds the state of cynicism that the public feels for media institutions , he said			1
" the whole thing is highly disturbing , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity148 contributed to this report .			0
