-- oh , the stories we storytellers tell			2
like the story of brave @entity4 and his doomed girlfriend			1
we love a good story			1
we love spinning a good yarn			1
and we repeat and repeat and repeat them			2
@entity10 was a big boy from an orphanage			1
@entity12 was a little horse that lost its first 17 races			1
@entity14 was a @entity15 born in 1887 or ' 88 ( as far as we know ) with the name @entity16			2
it is their legend , their lore			2
the same way that @entity24 cut down that tree or @entity26 split those logs			2
the same way that @entity28 was discovered at a drugstore called @entity30 's or that @entity31 wrote the part of @entity33 but would n't sell the script unless he could play it			1
documented achievement is what turns a man or woman into a public figure			2
but the story behind the story , well , that is also a telltale aspect of any human 's fame			1
yes , he did win this , she did win that , but come on , tell me a little more			2
how did they get this far ? where did they come from ? who influenced them ? what else should we know ? @entity59 was n't a mere boxer ; he was a man who changed his name and faith , a man who would fight anybody in a ring but refused to go to a war , a perfect physical specimen and a loudmouth who fell frail and all but mute from an affliction he could n't beat			2
lots of fighters won fights			2
the stories are what have made @entity75			2
it separates names from the norm			2
he or she is not just a success but a remarkable story , an inspiration , a believe - it - or - not			1
he was a left - handed pitcher with no right hand who threw a no - hitter for the @entity86			2
) he ran in the @entity88 on prosthetic legs			2
) she sprinted to an @entity88 gold even though they once nearly amputated her feet			2
) you ca n't make up stories like those			0
we know that @entity99 played ball better than most			0
but we also know @entity99 was married to @entity103			0
we can not tell you a lot about @entity106 or @entity107 except how they played ball			0
both played it as well as @entity99 did ... hey , maybe better			0
but in some cases , the stories of certain greats are as unforgettable as their deeds			0
so , we tell their tales			0
the subjects often furnish the details			0
we rely on honesty for accuracy			0
a story that has been reported is a story that ends up repeated because it must be true			1
we lazily assume facts not in evidence			0
or we lean on : " who would make up such a thing ? " which brings us to @entity4			1
the grim fairy tale of the linebacker of @entity131 is one we likely will tell for a while			0
we woke up thursday morning and began reading a story that got curiouser and curiouser with every sentence			1
his girlfriend was n't real ? she was n't in a car crash ? she did n't die of leukemia ? he never met her ? she did n't even exist ? ? ? @entity141 blarney is a myth , is it not ? pots o ' gold and @entity146 and the snakes and how are things in @entity149 and all that ? @entity151 , we are n't so gullible that we will swallow anything , would we , now ? so , ok			1
we tell and retell the true and false legends of @entity154 and winning one for the @entity155 and all that , but we do n't really mind			1
and maybe that october sky was n't really as blue - grey as @entity158 told us it was when those @entity160 rode to a great @entity131 victory on the ol ' gridiron			0
" @entity170 , it sounds almost like dancing ! " gushed @entity164 in " @entity165 , " and what a funny story that was			1
@entity4 's story , however ...			1
he is a @entity131 football star			0
trust me , this alone is not a news event			0
@entity131 turns out football stars the way @entity178 turned out twinkies			0
one after another after another			0
he is also a @entity183 kid with an apostrophe in his surname			0
now that , that is not something you see on a @entity131 football field every saturday			0
a nice , noteworthy thing , something that separated @entity4 from the pack , somewhat			1
he is also a natural born leader			0
one who helped take @entity131 to an undefeated season -- rare , in this day and age -- and to the national championship game			0
in the vote for the @entity198 , given to college football 's top player of any given season , @entity4 was the runner - up			1
that in itself is an honor , but for a linebacker to do such a thing , a defensive player , it is truly cool			0
@entity211 , but there was more to the @entity4 story , as we watched that story unfold			1
he had this girlfriend , see			1
@entity216 was her lovely name			0
a few months ago , she was in a car crash , we were told			0
and then doctors found she also had leukemia , we were told			0
her death , as well as that of his grandmother , broke @entity4 's heart			1
but on he played , gallantly , valiantly , fighting on for the @entity227 , remaining undefeated against adversity			0
until at some point it turned out to be a hoax			0
which at some point @entity131 's administrators discovered			1
which at some point @entity4 confirmed , although not publicly , not before that january 7 championship game against @entity237			1
@entity238 made the @entity237 quarterback 's girlfriend an overnight sensation that night , gushing about her looks			1
@entity238 did not make the @entity131 linebacker 's girlfriend a star that night			1
turns out , she was never anywhere			0
we love a good story and will continue to tell them			1
i , myself , once wrote of a @entity131 football star , @entity252 , who played in the @entity253 one night , flew home to @entity255 the next morning and found his mother dead inside their home			0
i made people cry with that story			1
i damn near cried myself while typing it			0
@entity4 's story makes me want to laugh as much as cry			1
mainly because i can barely comprehend it			0
all those stories being told out there on tv and in print about his " girlfriend " -- uh , he might have mentioned to someone that he 'd never even met her			2
how do the movies put it ? " based on a true story ? " well , based on a story , anyhow			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity278 .			1

@entity278 : we love spinning a good yarn , like @entity4 and his doomed girlfriend
@entity278 : @entity4 's story become curiouser and curiouser with every new detail
think of all the legends ( true or false ) about @entity10 , @entity12 , @entity154 , he says
