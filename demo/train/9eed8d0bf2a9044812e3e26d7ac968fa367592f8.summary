-- double world champion @entity1 suffered a disrupted second practice session ahead of sunday 's @entity3 , with @entity5 's @entity4 setting the pace on friday			1
@entity7 driver @entity1 was back at the track where he claimed the first of his two world championships 12 months ago -- the youngest driver to achieve the feat -- but the @entity13 spun out on the first corner of the @entity15			1
@entity1 , who has won 11 of 17 races in 2011 , recovered to rejoin practice with 10 minutes remaining , but finished in sixth position on a track where he has won for the past two years			1
he ended the day half a second behind @entity4 's leading time of one minute 39.586 secs			1
@entity4 , world champion in 2008 but only fifth overall after a disappointing season , led second - placed teammate @entity22 ahead of saturday 's qualifying			1
latest f1 standings after @entity26 " i lost the car on the entrance to turn one , " @entity1 , who clinched the 2011 championship with third place in @entity29 last month , told the sport 's official website			2
" i think i was too wide and too far on to the kerb , so i lost the rear and could n't catch the car anymore			0
i was lucky to get out again at the end of @entity38 ; there was n't much damage apart from the front wing			0
" @entity42 racer @entity4 was pleased with his form and was confident ahead of this season 's penultimate race			1
" it was a really positive day for me , " the 26 - year - old said			0
" the track just got better and better today , so i slowly chipped away at the set - up			0
" the tires are behaving well -- at the last race i had degradation and did n't have the pace , so it feels much better this weekend			2
that 's a real positive for me			0
" when you come through a friday without any problems , it definitely makes you feel confident for the rest of the weekend			0
" @entity22 , the 2009 world champion and running second this year , admitted to experimenting during his practice run on a track where passing has traditionally been difficult			1
" i was playing around with overtaking on my long run , " the 31 - year - old said			0
" but i still reckon it 'll be difficult to overtake people in the @entity68 zones			0
" so i think it 's going to be a bit of a struggle to make moves stick in the race -- which means it 's going to be important to qualify up at the front			2
it 's tricky around here , but we made some good progress here this afternoon and evening			0
" @entity81 's @entity80 also slid off having spent a short period leading the field			0
the double world champion eventually came home third ahead of @entity87 teammate @entity86			1
@entity1 's fellow @entity7 driver @entity88 was fifth fastest , with seven - time world champion @entity90 seventh for @entity91			1
the 2011 campaign will finish at the @entity87 @entity3 in @entity93 on november 27 .			2
