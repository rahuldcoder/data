what was known as the nuclear option yesterday is known as the @entity2 today			1
time will only tell if the @entity2 is productive or destructive			2
but we 'll leave that to the historians			2
as for how it became the @entity10 rule , it took a coordinated and sustained effort from an unlikely place -- progressive activists on the blogosphere			1
after sen. @entity16 died in 2009 , @entity15 lost their supermajority in the @entity18 -- enough to overcome a @entity20 filibuster -- progressive bloggers felt compelled to act against what they called " @entity20 obstructionism			1
" the @entity18 , still with a huge majority of 59 democrats , coupled with a @entity15 majority in the @entity27 , struggled to pass legislation			1
the power of the @entity20 minority was outsized , filibuster opponents say			2
and filibuster reform became their mission			2
@entity36 blogger @entity35 started to drum up support online			2
" i knew that this would be an issue because i had seen mounting threats of obstructionism on the @entity20 side , " @entity35 told @entity38			2
5 ways life changes in the @entity18 after nuclear option he wrote extensively about filibuster reform in 2005 , another time when the @entity18 was mired in partisan gridlock			1
at that time it was over president @entity52 's judicial nominees and @entity15 were in the minority			0
republicans threatened the nuclear option then , but never acted			1
eventually , the bipartisan " @entity59 " senators cut a deal that calmed things down			1
in the @entity61 era , @entity35 argued that the use of the filibuster grew out of control			0
after blogging about the ability of the @entity20 minority to block legislation and presidential nominations , @entity35 knew grassroots activists could only do so much			0
while they could engage fellow activists , he was n't so sure he could convince senators , especially the veterans steeped in @entity18 tradition and reluctant to change the ways of the past , that change was possible			1
there was precedent but @entity35 knew that things could change			0
as draconian as the @entity18 could be , he knew the @entity18 had changed in the past			1
@entity18 historian @entity80 believes that although the first filibuster took place in the very first @entity84 , the word filibuster was not used until the 1850s			1
at that time , there was no way to stop a rogue senator from holding up business until 1917 when senators voted to change the rules to allow a cloture vote , which enabled 67 senators to defeat the stalling tactic			1
what is the nuclear option ? the filibuster was famously used to block two different versions of the @entity99			1
former sen. @entity101 's successful 24 - hour talkathon helped to kill civil rights legislation in 1957			0
sen. @entity103 , @entity104 , tried the same tactic in 1964			0
his 14 - hour filibuster was part of a 57 - day - long stalling effort that , ultimately , was not effective in killing the legislation			0
the next major change to the filibuster came in 1975 , when the threshold to stop a filibuster was lowered from 67 lawmakers to 60			1
growing support @entity35 and his co-conspirators formed a strategy referred to as an inside - outside coalition			2
the outside consisted of the grassroots , charged with motivating progressives to sign petitions and call their senators			2
the inside , @entity35 said , needed to sway senators			2
it would need to consist of people senators knew and trusted			2
he had to convince a diverse group of advocates that climate change , immigration , the judiciary , and the economy all had one thing in common : the filibuster blocked their legislative goals			0
" getting them to recognize outside their issue silo there 's this one issue frustrating all of you " was key to success , @entity35 said			0
that 's when fix the @entity146 formed			0
so did the @entity148 and the @entity149 , just to name a few			0
@entity149 president @entity150 said it was clear something needed to be done			0
for instance , @entity61 did an end run around @entity20 opposition to the appointment of @entity157 to head the @entity158			0
a circuit court ruled that the appointment was illegal			0
@entity150 said those actions were " connected " because @entity20 opposition kept the president from filling the four circuit court vacancies			0
" that 's the torturous route that brought us to agreement , " @entity150 said			0
@entity150 said he and the coalition of groups persuaded two million of their members to either call , e-mail or write their senators pushing for filibuster reform			1
the man who coined the term ' nuclear option ' regrets ever pursuing it he also said that at the @entity148 conference this summer , around the time the @entity18 was on the brink of invoking the nuclear option , leaders paused the program for attendees to call their senators to end the filibuster			1
things started to shift when senator majority leader @entity10 became warm to the idea			1
at first @entity10 was reluctant , but when handshake agreements with his counterpart , @entity192 leader @entity192 , did n't stick , @entity10 became more open , eventually turning his threats of nuclear option into reality			1
while it only applies to presidential nominees , it excludes legislative matters			0
advocates , however , say this is a good start			0
" i might be destroying the @entity18 , " @entity35 said on his radio program thursday just before the @entity10 pulled the trigger			1
but he quickly dismissed that assessment : " but it kind of sucks now			0

the progressive blogosphere had a major role in invoking the nuclear option
a coalition of labor and advocacy groups persuaded 2 million members to contact their senators
