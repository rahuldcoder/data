sen. @entity0 is blaming politicians for the unrest in @entity3 , @entity4 , arguing that the criminal justice system fuels racial tension by disproportionately targeting african - americans			1
the so - called war on drugs has created a culture of violence and put police in a nearly impossible situation , " @entity0 said in an op - ed published for @entity8			1
he acknowledged that the shooting death of @entity16 by a @entity3 police officer was n't related to drugs , but argued that outsized penalties for nonviolent drug crimes creates a " tension in some communities that too often results in tragedy			1
" the comments are another attempt by @entity0 , a @entity27 @entity26 and likely 2016 presidential contender , to seize on the violence in @entity3 as an opportunity to make inroads with minorities			1
he 's blending his libertarian - leaning views about the war on drugs with a message that emphasizes the importance of individual responsibility			0
and he 's doing this while other possible @entity41 presidential prospects -- like @entity43 sen. @entity42 or @entity45 gov. @entity44 -- are largely silent on the turmoil unfolding in @entity3			1
back in august , as violence first unfolded on the streets of @entity3 , @entity0 made a splash with an op - ed -- also in @entity8 -- blasting the government for over-militarizing local police forces			1
the piece made him one of the few political voices willing to weigh in on the issue at the time			0
@entity0 did n't address police forces in tuesday 's op - ed , and he also refrained from addressing the grand jury 's decision not to indict officer @entity60			1
rather , he focused his opinion piece on broader issues that cause what he frequently describes as an " undercurrent of unease " in poor communities			0
while he said criminal justice reform is a crucial need , he ultimately argued it 's up to individuals themselves to improve their lives			1
saying he has " no intention to scold , " @entity0 stressed that escaping the " poverty trap will require all of us to relearn that not only are we our brother 's keeper , we are our own keeper			2
" @entity78 : ' no sympathy ' for violence in @entity3 " while a hand - up can be part of the plan , if the plan does n't include the self - discovery of education , work , and the self - esteem that comes with work , the cycle of poverty will continue , " he continued			1
his hope , he concluded , is that a non-political leader will emerge " who motivates and inspires all of us to discover traits , ambitions , and moral codes that have slowly eroded and left us empty with despair			0
" @entity0 's critics , however , have consistently questioned the senator 's libertarian views that have put him in hot water in the past , such as his doubts about a provision of the @entity106 involving property rights and discrimination			2
he 's tried to sell his overall nontraditional ideology to wider audiences , and trumpet his efforts in doing so			0
in the past year , he 's spoken at the @entity112 and addressed historically black colleges			0
he 's also helped the @entity41 open up an office in @entity115 , and he was there for the @entity41 's office opening in urban @entity118			0
@entity0 visited @entity3 last month to meet with @entity120 leaders , and told @entity121 later in the day that the @entity41 's " biggest mistake " in the past few decades has been not competing for @entity123 ' votes			1
he made headlines last week for meeting with rev. @entity126 , a civil rights leader and controversial figure who says he considers @entity0 a competitive threat for @entity129 in 2016			2
on the legislative side , @entity0 has made proposals in the @entity132 that would restore voting rights to felons with nonviolent drug convictions and would reform the criminal justice system to lower penalties for similar convictions			2
@entity0 and his @entity129 buds @entity0 's minority outreach efforts have certainly earned him plenty of media attention and accolades by some in @entity123 - @entity123 communities , but others say it 's not enough			1
rep. @entity148 argued @entity0 's attempts to court @entity123 voters are " welcome " endeavors , but he 'll " need to do a much better job if he actually expects to win them			1
" in an opinion piece monday for @entity156 , the @entity129 congresswoman from @entity158 harpooned @entity0 for saying last week in an interview that there 's been no " bigger defender of minority rights in the @entity163 " than himself			1
@entity164 to @entity78 : @entity165 to @entity166 it 's a comment @entity0 has made repeatedly this year , and it always lands him in trouble with critics who point to sitting rep. @entity170 , a civil rights icon who spoke at the 1963 march on @entity173 among other key events			2
but @entity177 , in her op - ed , described @entity0 's legislative pushes involving drug sentencing reform as " low - hanging fruit " and blasted @entity0 for failing to " corral any significant support from his @entity26 colleagues			2
" " doing the bare minimum , though , does n't make you a hero , " she wrote			0
" nor do you get much credit just for showing up			0
" @entity126 , however , appears to think @entity0 is making inroads with @entity123			2
following their meeting last week , he argued that @entity0 may not necessarily generate a lot of support among black voters , but his outreach may stop them from voting against him if he becomes the @entity41 nominee			1
this , he told @entity198 , could be bad for @entity129 turnout			0
" if he 's able to neutralize his past image on civil rights , if he becomes the candidate ... and if you do n't get a huge black turnout saying ' we 're afraid [ of him ] , ' " that could be a pitfall for @entity129			0
" i think he knows it 's unlikely someone like @entity126 would endorse him , but i ca n't ignore him , " he added			0
" he 's openly dealing with issues that [ politicians ] including people in the @entity129 , have n't done			0
" complete coverage of what 's happening in @entity3			0

@entity0 wrote a column for @entity8 following the decision in @entity3
he said that politicians are to blame in @entity3 and elsewhere
individuals , he argued , are ultimately responsible for their own fate
his comments are part of his *aggressive* minority outreach
