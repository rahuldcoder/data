@entity0 , @entity1 -- the sight of a baby girl suckling on the breast of her dead mother changed the course of @entity9 's life forever			1
the year was 1980 and @entity1 lay in the grip of what would become one of the most devastating famines in its history			1
@entity9 , a devout @entity16 , was on a pilgrimage to a holy site in the north - east region of the country when she came across the dead mother and her baby , lying amid a sea of people who were starving to death			1
" when i was returning , there were so many of these hungry people sprawled all over , you could not even walk , " @entity9 told @entity2			1
" i had some bread on me , so i tried to feed them			0
when i reached this woman , she was dead , but the child was still suckling at her breast , " she continued			1
" one of the chauffeurs charged with picking up the corpses said to me , ' i am waiting for the child to die so i can pick up both bodies			0
i just ca n't bear to take the child as well while she is still alive , ' " @entity9 said			1
without a second thought , @entity9 bundled the tiny girl into her arms and smuggled her to the country 's capital , @entity0			1
in that instant , she transformed both the baby 's future and her own			1
haunted by the images of the dying people , it was n't long before @entity9 headed back to the countryside in an effort to source water for the destitute locals			2
she came across another child in the arms of his dying father			0

@entity9 told @entity2 : " at the end of the day , as we were going home we came upon five people , three of them dead , two alive			1
one of the men dying by the side of the road said to me , ' this is my child			0
' " @entity9 took the baby boy home which posed a threat to her own safety , she explained to @entity2			1
" it was a terrible famine			0
the government at that time did not want the famine to be public knowledge			0
so i had to pretend the children were mine and smuggle them out			2
" by the end of 1980 , @entity9 had taken in 21 children			1
but her desire to save the young children caused friction in her family			2
" my family , my husband gave me an ultimatum , choose the children or choose your life , " she told @entity2			2
" my relatives , even my mother said , ' she has gone mad , she should be checked at the mental institution			2
' " @entity9 continued : " i was not welcome at home			2
so i decided to move to some land i had bought with the intention of raising some chicken			0
i moved into this forest area with the kids			0
" thirty years on and @entity9 , now more famously known as " @entity103 's @entity102 , " is the founder of @entity1 's oldest orphanage			1
@entity9 's thirty - year legacy means she has raised a generation of @entity1 's abandoned children , orphaned by the ravages of famine , war and @entity111			1
however , leaving her own family was a tough decision for @entity9 , who had struggled since childhood to gain an education , job and secure family life			1
born in 1938 , she was only a month - old when her father was killed during the @entity121 - @entity120 war			0
as tradition dictated , she was brought up by her father 's parents until the age of 11 , when she was married off without her consent			0
revolting against her marriage , @entity9 ran away from home to @entity0 , where she scraped a basic education , gained a job as a quality controller and remarried			2
she told @entity2 : " i suffered because of the traditions of the country i was born in			0
my goal is not to marry them off , but to raise them as adults who can take care of themselves			0
" @entity9 has come a long way since 1980 when she struggled to survive , resorting to selling her possessions and tearing up her own dresses to make clothes for the infants			2
now her orphanage , as well as sheltering , also acts as a school , educating over 700 children			1
but she says : " i have no regrets			0
@entity149 has helped me get to this point			0
i always had great faith in @entity149			0
" i knew we would survive , even selling small things by the roadside			0
i am so happy because none of the children died , and all of them grew up			0

@entity9 is the founder of @entity1 's first orphanage
her *humanitarian* work started when she saved the life of a baby girl suckling on the breast of her dead mother
now @entity9 's orphanage cares for over 700 children
