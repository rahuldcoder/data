lengths some people will go to earn frequent flier miles			1
over his lifetime , he 's accrued about four million miles			1
half of those , he estimates , were earned on " mile runs " -- trips taken for the sole purpose of earning points			1
recently , he completed a dizzying , non-stop trip ( @entity14 - @entity18 - @entity15 - @entity17 - @entity15 - @entity14 - @entity16 - @entity14 - @entity15 - @entity14 ) that would set most people 's heads spinning			0
it took four days ( three of which were spent almost completely on a plane ) , and he accrued 270,000 miles			1
he admits that the journey was exhausting , but ultimately worth it			0
" to put it into some kind of perspective , it 's enough miles for two first - class tickets between the @entity33 and @entity34 , " he notes			1
" if i would have paid cash for them , they would have each cost me over $ 20,000			0
" december -- which marks the last opportunity for many frequent fliers to earn enough to gain ( or maintain ) their elite statuses -- is mile - run season			1
in the past , the trick was looking for a cheap ticket that went the distance , as miles earned were calculated by , well , miles flown			2
this year , that is all set to change			0
" in 33 years of frequent flier programs , this is the year of the biggest changes ever , " says @entity49 , founder of the online travel forum @entity50 and ceo of @entity52 , which offers guidance to road warriors the world over			1
" some of the world 's largest frequent flier programs are going to a revenue model , " he explains , noting that come this year , many programs will start awarding members based on how much they spend , not how far they fly			1
@entity65 started the trend when it introduced @entity67 in 2004			0
other airlines have followed suit over the years , such as @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 ( the latter -- which awards members 10 points for every dollar spent -- has one of the most popular frequent flier programs in the @entity33 )			1
starting this month , both @entity79 and @entity80 shifted to a completely revenue - based system of calculating miles earned			2
@entity49 predicts it 's only a matter of time before the @entity85 carriers follow suit			0
" they may say they wo n't , because they do n't want to upset things , but these ( carriers ) are part of alliances			0
over the next two years , i think you 'll start to see revenue - based frequent flier programs tremble out through the rest of the airline industry			1
" @entity49 notes there 's also been a shift in hotel awards programs			0
" a lot of hotel programs are changing what it costs per night come january			2
if you 're planning on redeeming hotel rooms later this year , do it now			0
get the redemptions at lower prices , " he advises			0
as for points earned and spent on plane tickets , there 's little to be done but to accept airlines ' change in policy			1
" it 's too late for you to do anything			0
but here 's what you do n't do			0
do not buy a more expensive ticket to earn miles			2
you 'd be playing into what the airlines want			2
it 's okay to earn fewer miles on a cheap ticket , because you 'll still be able to find cheap awards out there , " he says			2
