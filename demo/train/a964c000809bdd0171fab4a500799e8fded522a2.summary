-- october 1 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity14 , @entity15 : it 's the start of a new month , the start of the government 's fiscal year -- we 'll explain why that one 's important in a second -- and of course , it is the most awesome day of the week			1
first up : @entity26 @entity27 : first up , @entity29 votes to keep the government running , at least for another two months			1
here 's the deal : the government has a budget for every fiscal , or financial year , which starts on october 1st			1
the budget says where different money goes and how it 's spent			1
@entity29 has to pass that budget ; they have n't done that yet			1
without a budget , the government would shut down			1
so this week , @entity29 passed what 's called a stop - gap measure			1
that 's going to keep things running for two months			1
some people say that @entity29 only passed the stop - gap to avoid tough questions from voters			1
this is an election year and it might be hard to get re-elected if you have to explain why you voted against the budget and let the government shut down			1
other folks are upset that @entity29 would n't stick around to work on the budget			1
after they passed the stop - gap , most congressmen and women headed home to campaign			1
these budget delays are n't a new thing though			2
over the last 35 years , @entity29 has missed the october 1st deadline more often than it 's made it			1
@entity64 @entity65 , @entity15 : today 's @entity64 goes out to mrs. @entity67 ' 8th grade @entity66 at @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity70 ! what is the second most populated country in the world ? is it : a ) @entity5 , b ) @entity75 , c ) @entity76 or @entity77 ) the @entity78 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! with more than one billion people , @entity5 is second on the list , right behind @entity75			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! holy site divided @entity27 : most of that population , around 80 percent , follows the @entity89 religion			1
there are also more than 160 million muslims in @entity5			1
and those two groups -- plus one smaller religious group -- have been fighting over a holy site in @entity5			1
all three groups say it should belong to them			2
yesterday , a court ruling ordered the groups to divide up the site			1
@entity5 's government sent out extra security forces after the decision to try and keep things calm			1
in the past , the fighting over this holy site has led to violence in different parts of the country			1
@entity109 explains how this fight started			2
( begin video ) @entity112 , @entity0 correspondent , @entity113 : the legal battle over this piece of land in @entity4 , @entity5 has spanned more than a century			1
the bitter dispute pits @entity89 against @entity91 and has sparked some of the deadliest riots the country has experienced since partition			2
@entity122 , director general of archives : @entity4 has captured the imaginations of the people in and around that region for well over 150 years			2
for the first time after independence though , the problem surfaced in 1949 when an idol was placed in the mosque			2
@entity132 : the main fight is over who is entitled to this piece of land some consider sacred			2
in the 1500s , a mosque was built on the site by @entity5 's then @entity91 rulers			1
but @entity89 believe long before the mosque was constructed , a temple stood to mark the birthplace of one of their most adored @entity89 dieties , @entity144			2
( @entity146 ) this day in history [ @entity148 ] october 1 , 1908 -- @entity149 unveils the @entity150 , the first affordable car mass produced in the @entity78 october 1 , 1949 -- @entity75 is established as a communist nation october 1 , 1958 -- @entity153 , the @entity153 , opens its doors october 1 , 1982 -- the first cds , compact discs , are released to the public is this legit ? @entity158 , @entity15 : is this legit ? light travels at more than 180,000 miles per second			1
legit ! and a light - year , the distance that light can travel in one year , is around 5.8 trillion miles			1
new @entity164 @entity27 : scientists say a newly discovered planet that 's about 20 light years away from @entity167 could be the closest thing they 've found out there so far to our home world			2
it 's called @entity173 and this is an artist 's conception of what it looks like			2
the red thing is a dwarf star			2
@entity173 orbits the star kinda like the @entity167 orbits the sun. the similarities do n't stop there			1
experts think this planet has enough gravity to keep an atmosphere around it			2
they say there 's also a good chance that there 's water on the planet			2
but , there is at least one difference and it 's pretty significant			2
one of the scientists who discovered the planet explains			2
@entity197 , univ. of @entity199 , @entity200 : this planet does n't have days and nights			2
wherever you are on this planet , the sun is in the same position , or the star is in the same position all the time			2
so , it keeps one side facing towards the star , and that 's fairly warm			2
and the other side is in perpetual nighttime			2
the @entity215 @entity27 : sticking with the science theme , people are always looking for ways to help this planet			0
well , some scientists are squealing about an idea that involves pigs			0
you 've heard of green eggs and ham			0
@entity227 introduces us to enviropig ! ( begin video ) @entity230 , @entity0 sr. correspondent : it looks just like a pig			1
@entity234 @entity233 , @entity235 : it looks , sounds , acts identical to a normal @entity238 pig			1
@entity239 : but it is different genetically			0
to create this pig , scientists here added an e. coli bacteria gene and mouse dna to a normal pig embryo			1
they call it an enviropig			0
i mean , actually , the idea is that someone like this could end up on a dinner plate			0
@entity254 : certainly , one of the goals of the technology is to produce a pig which could be consumed by humans and enter the food chain			1
we have done extensive testing , though , on the various internal organs and different meat cuts from the enviropig , looked at the nutritional content			0
they 're identical to a normal @entity238 pig			1
@entity269 , @entity270 : what i can tell the @entity78 public is that no food from a genetically - engineered animal will go on the market unless the @entity270 has demonstrated that it 's safe			1
@entity239 : but the original idea was not to create a bigger , tastier pig			1
why create a pig like this ? @entity254 : to try to control and reduce the environmental footprint of pig farming around the world by reducing the amount of phosphorous that the pig produces			1
@entity239 : @entity287 is a nutrient that helps the pigs grow , but that they ca n't fully digest			0
so , much of it comes out in their manure			0
farmers use that manure as fertilizer			0
when it rains , some of the manure runs off into the watershed , meaning plenty of phosphorous gets into our rivers and lakes			0
the enviropig 's genetic additions allow it to digest more phosphorous			0
about 50 percent more , according to researchers			0
that means half as much in its manure , and that 's why it 's called enviropig			0
but the head of the @entity318 , an organization promoting organic agriculture , says hog farming needs to change , not the pigs			0
@entity322 , @entity318 : it 's a completely novel cell invasion technology where we are crossing the boundaries of nature as no other generation has before			0
( @entity146 ) blog report @entity27 : civility			0
a study at @entity331 examines it			0
we asked on our blog how you would " bring back nice			0
" @entity336 writes that " people are constantly thinking of themselves , so they ca n't think or be nice to anyone else			0
" @entity339 suggests " having a council meeting , a pep talk or some sort of rally on why it 's important to be nice to others			0
" @entity346 says " students could interact with people face - to - face instead of over phones or computers			1
why do n't we do that , " he asks			0
@entity352 feels " we should start out by teaching kids ways to be polite			0
a lot of people are rude without even realizing it			0
" @entity357 thinks " it could help to have courtesy classes in schools			0
" in her opinion , politeness is decreasing drastically			0
on the blog , we only read comments with first names ; no initials , no schools			0
please stick to first names only			0
teachers ' @entity368 @entity27 : we 've been asking for your thoughts about bullying on our blog			0
teachers , we want to hear what you have to say , too			0
go to @entity375 , scroll down to the @entity376			0
that 's where you can sound off on education issues			0
this week 's question : what do you think schools should do about bullying ? before we go @entity27 : before we go today , we 've all heard that story about the tortoise beating the hare			0
but now we get to see what happens when that tell - tale tortoise takes on someone its own size			1
what these speed demons lack in speed , they make up for in -- i do n't know -- determination ? well , there is something that 's sort of interesting : last year 's winner lost			0
goodbye @entity27 : we guess he 's just a shell of his former self			0
see ? you see ? even the pun possibilities contort us into bad jokes			0
you guys have a good weekend			0
please join us back on monday when we return			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity24 .			1
