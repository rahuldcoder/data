editor 's note : @entity2 has been chancellor of the @entity4 @entity3 since 2002			1
@entity2 says @entity5 became a champion for @entity4 's children			1
@entity4 ( @entity8 ) -- i was named schools chancellor in @entity4 in 2002 , shortly after mayor @entity12 won control over the city 's school system			1
at the time , our schools were in desperate need of a strong advocate			2
few prominent @entity4 were willing to take a chance on our schools -- or invest in a system that many saw as beyond repair			1
i approached @entity5 about serving our city 's school system because it would send a powerful message to the entire city about the importance of school reform and also because i was convinced , having known her personally , that she had the right skills to put together an office of strategic partnerships to undergird our efforts			1
without hesitation , @entity5 joined our effort , and started building partnerships with the private sector on behalf of children			2
she essentially became a champion for @entity4 's children , who badly needed her advocacy			1
before the mayor and i took charge , @entity4 had not actively tried to raise money for its public schools			2
@entity5 took over an office that previously oversaw donations to ptas and alumni associations and recreated it around a model of a public - private partnership			2
the model she created in @entity4 has led to similar efforts in other school districts across @entity54			0
private donors were historically reluctant to make gifts to public schools because there was so little accountability and transparency around spending and outcomes			0
@entity5 created a system that measured results			0
a new transparency around outcomes , along with @entity5 's proficiency in articulating the goals of our reforms , gave private funders an unprecedented stake in the success of schools and students and attracted large amounts of new funding			1
@entity5 was highly focused , efficient and hands - on in this effort			0
she verified the value of her work by visiting schools to see how funds were affecting principals , teachers and students			0
she was unafraid of asking hard questions , bringing diverse groups together and looking for alternative solutions			1
she framed problems in ways that made them solvable			0
these are qualities that served @entity4 's 1.1 million public schoolchildren well			1
under her leadership , @entity95 has raised more than $ 240 million from businesses , foundations and individuals , according to the fund			0
schools have used these funds to improve middle schools , improve libraries , provide arts programs and train public school principals			0
@entity5 's belief that government can improve people 's lives -- and the way she put this belief to work on behalf of the city 's public schools -- has inspired many people			1
in my experience , @entity5 's belief in and passion for public service are contagious			2
if she is selected to represent our state in the @entity123 , i have no doubt that she would put that passion , along with her estimable talents , to work for @entity4 in every corner of our state			0
i 've spoken with @entity5 this week about her decision to seek the @entity123 seat			0
she understands that the stakes have never been higher , and she knows that @entity4 need to have a senator who will fight for them in @entity133			0
@entity5 is prepared to work hard for @entity4 -- bringing jobs to our state , helping us win funding for infrastructure and homeland security , and helping to improve health care and education for @entity4			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0
