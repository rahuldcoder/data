-- former @entity2 president @entity1 said tuesday he resigned as the head of the @entity4 five years ago and has never tried to resume the post -- one that he was thought to still hold			1
it was the first time that the 84 - year - old leader of @entity2 's revolution stated so directly that he no longer heads up the party he founded			1
" without hesitation , i resigned all of my state and political positions , including that of the @entity19 , when i fell ill and i never tried to exercise them again after the proclamation of july 31 , 2006 , " he wrote in an essay published in @entity2 state media			0
he said he did not try to resume his positions " even when i partially recovered my health a year later , although everyone , affectionately , continued to refer to me by those titles			0
" @entity2 and foreign observers had believed that the head of the @entity4 was the one title that @entity1 still held after he was forced to cede power to his younger brother , @entity29 , due to a health emergency caused by intestinal problems			1
@entity2 plans to hold its first @entity32 in almost 14 years next month			0
@entity29 has stressed that the focus of the meeting will be sweeping economic changes to the @entity37 - style economy			0
but there was intense speculation that the elder @entity1 would step down as the head of the party during the event , and his brother would move into the role			2
@entity1 also shot back at @entity46 president @entity45 , who criticized @entity2 in a speech in @entity48 , @entity49 , on monday and demanded greater freedoms for the @entity2 people			1
" when the president looked anxiously at the public after mentioning treacherous @entity2 , waiting for an explosion of applause , he was met by a glacial silence , " @entity1 wrote in the essay .			2

many thought @entity1 still held the top spot in @entity2 's @entity4
@entity1 stepped down as president of @entity2 in 2006 due to health problems
@entity1 's younger brother , @entity65 , is expected to become party president
