-- on wednesday , the @entity1 published photos of @entity4 soldiers posing with what the paper said were bodies of insurgents in @entity9			1
the newspaper said a soldier came forward with the images to draw attention to the safety risk associated with a decline in leadership and discipline			2
in the @entity1 story , editor @entity18 said publishing the photos " would fulfill our obligation to readers to report vigorously and impartially on all aspects of the @entity4 mission in @entity9 , including the allegation that the images reflect a breakdown in unit discipline that was endangering @entity4 troops			1
" the @entity1 said efforts to get responses from the soldiers involved were unsuccessful			1
@entity0 has not independently authenticated the photos			2
the images are just the latest in a string of scandals that some say could damage @entity4 efforts in the war , which is in its 11th year			1
in january , video footage emerged of @entity4 soldiers apparently urinating on @entity9 corpses			1
in february , @entity9 rioted after it was discovered that @entity42 had been burned in violation of @entity45 custom at @entity46 in @entity9			1
last month , an @entity48 staff sergeant allegedly went on a rampage and shot to death 17 @entity9 civilians , including numerous children			1
the @entity4 is due to hand over control of the country to @entity9 forces in 2014			1
on thursday @entity9 president @entity56 called for an " accelerated " transition of security responsibilities to the country 's forces			1
he called the photos " inhumane and provocative			2
" @entity0 spoke with three national security and military experts about the images and what impact they may have on the @entity4 mission in @entity9			1
here 's an edited version of their responses			2
read the complete interviews here @entity71 : ' very , very difficult time stabilizing this country ' @entity71 is a former @entity73 agent who spent most of his career in the @entity75			1
his book " @entity77 " has been lauded for its first - person look inside the agency and for its analysis of events leading up the war on terror			2
i think the situation there is going from bad to worse			2
... it 's incidents like these which are dividing @entity4 troops from the @entity9			1
i just do n't see it getting better			2
of course , this is an isolated event			2
it 's not the @entity95 , but if it continues on like this -- more bad news -- we 're going to have a very , very difficult time stabilizing this country before 2014			2
getting into one of these wars is very easy			0
it 's very , very difficult for a @entity105 to walk away from this , especially when the same people that attacked us on 9/11 are going to come back			0
for a politician to say , ' hey , let 's forget about it , let 's hope for the best , let 's leave ' -- this is a problem for the @entity105			0
they can not be seen to be losing a war			0
it does n't really matter that we never really won the war			2
it 's just morphed into something else , into a quagmire , guerrilla warfare			0
i do n't think we 're going to speed it up , we 're just going to hope for the best and get better control of the military			2
and hope that the @entity9 will be able to take this over			1
i 'm not very confident , though			0
@entity129 : ' very damaging to all the @entity4 efforts ' @entity129 is a retired @entity48 general			1
he works as a consultant in @entity132			0
this is very damaging to all the @entity4 efforts , specifically the @entity4 effort to assure it stays in harness with the @entity9 government and the @entity9 security forces moving forward in this critically important mission			1
this does nothing but throw sand into that fabric of trying to establish and trying reinforce what has been , over the last decade , a reasonably good relationship			0
there 's nothing good that comes from this			0
sadly , you had soldiers ostensibly dehumanizing the enemy			2
that ca n't be done			2
you 've got to hold these bad guys with respect that they deserve if they 're willing to kill themselves to achieve a goal ... our soldiers understand this			2
these are several bad apples			0
you need to always respect your enemy , so you better understand them			0
the record of the military in our conflicts , both in @entity9 and @entity166 , and routine activities that take place every day around the globe [ have been ] decentralized out to young men and women like these folks [ in the photos ] , who sadly made a huge mistake			1
but most folks -- 99 % of our military -- do a magnificent job			0
so you have to let the record speak for itself			0
what you have to do locally -- and gen. @entity180 [ the @entity4 and @entity182 commander in @entity9 ] understands this intimately -- you have a lot of damage control to do			1
you have to anticipate what the reaction is going to be in @entity9			1
it speaks to this isolated incident , and it does n't speak to a full breakdown in terms of morale and discipline and capabilities in our military			1
... the military in this case is losing ground because they 've achieved so many great things , specifically in @entity9 , and this incident is setting them back			1
@entity200 : ' we 'll get an orderly withdrawal ' retired gen. @entity200 served as supreme allied commander of @entity182 from 1997 to 2000 in the @entity205 war			1
once a @entity206 at @entity207 , he has a degree in philosophy , politics and economics , and a master 's degree in military science			0
he served 34 years in the @entity48 and ran in the 2004 presidential election			0
[ the photos do n't ] represent the standards or the training or the values of the @entity4 armed forces			1
our soldiers and our leaders know you do n't pose with dead enemy bodies , and there 's a lot of other things that you do n't do			1
i think the men and women of the armed forces have done a remarkable job , our leadership has done a remarkable job			1
no one ever expected when this conflict started that we 'd be in it [ almost ] 11 years later , a volunteer army would have held together and done so very well			0
this is an exception , and i know the military will take their proper measures			0
we 've accomplished our major objective there			0
we 've taken strong measures against @entity246 -- it 's a broken organization , at least as it was in 2001			0
and it 's not going to recover , at least not in the near term there			0
there are other enemies on the ground there in @entity9 , and it 's been a tough fight			1
so winning the hearts and minds ? i think we can continue training @entity9 security forces			1
i think we can expect to fulfill the obligations to @entity56 's government			0
i think we 'll get an orderly withdrawal out of that region , as president @entity265 said , [ in ] 2014			0
that 's what we 're really looking for			0
there will be mixed feelings , because those mixed feelings on the ground among the populace are inevitable in wartime			0
this is a country that 's been through 40 years of war			0
so , there have been a lot of losses , a lot of tragedy , there 's been a lot of hatred			0
this is one more small piece of that .			0
