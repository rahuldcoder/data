@entity1 president @entity0 told a @entity3 magazine that " there have n't been any tangible " signs that @entity7 - led airstrikes in his country have weakened @entity9 , despite assertions wednesday by @entity7 's top diplomat that " significant progress " has been made in derailing the @entity13 extremist group			1
in an interview with @entity16 , a portion of which was published online wednesday , @entity0 said his government has " noticed no change " in @entity9 since the air campaign began more than two months ago			0
" it is n't true that the strikes are helpful , " the @entity1 president said			1
" they would , of course , have helped had they been serious and efficient			0
" after first striking @entity9 targets in @entity29 , the @entity7 - led coalition went after the group inside @entity1 in september			1
these efforts have n't been coordinated with @entity0 's government , which @entity7 and other @entity34 leaders have said they want replaced -- even going as far , in some cases , as supporting and working with moderate opposition forces fighting to unseat him			1
airstrikes mark shift in coalition focus to @entity9 ' capital ' yet @entity0 said in his @entity16 interview , which took place on november 28 in @entity44 and will be published in full thursday , that the @entity7 - led military campaign has limited use because " you ca n't end terrorism with aerial strikes			1
troops on the ground that know the land and can react are essential			0
" whether or not the strikes have hurt @entity9 , there 's been little indication that they or anything else has gotten @entity1 closer to an end to a civil war that erupted after mostly peaceful protests in @entity61 province in march 2011			1
@entity62 says @entity64 coalition has made progress @entity7 secretary of state @entity62 , however , offered a very different view of the @entity68 fight wednesday			1
addressing reporters in @entity70 , @entity71 , after a meeting of representatives from the 60 members of the coalition , @entity62 said various efforts -- from more than 1,000 airstrikes to sanctions -- have significantly hampered @entity9 in the @entity79			1
" there was a consensus that the momentum which it had exhibited 2Â½ months ago has been halted , " he said			0
@entity9 " has been forced to modify its tactics , and some of those modifications are severely hampering their ability to operate in the way that they were			0
" he added that the coalition has taken important steps in " defeating ( @entity9 ) on the battlefield , restricting its finances , enacting laws to restrict the flow of foreign fighters and countering its toxic ideology			2
" the airstrikes are part of that overall strategy , and they show no signs of letting up			0
@entity101 said that between monday and wednesday of this week , there were 14 coalition airstrikes in @entity1 -- all of them near @entity104 , the city near the @entity107 border that in recent weeks has become a key battleground in the ongoing fight -- in addition to 11 such strikes inside @entity29			1
conflicting figures the @entity113 has estimated more than 100,000 people have died in the @entity1 civil war			0
yet the @entity116 says the toll is much higher , claiming tuesday that it 's more than 200,000 people -- among them about 63,000 civilians , 45,000 @entity1 troops and more than 50,000 rebel fighters			2
millions more have been displaced inside @entity1 by the violence , with the @entity113 estimating up to 1.8 million refugees in neighboring @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity107 , @entity29 and @entity126			0
and the situation may only get worse , after the @entity113 's @entity128 earlier this week announced the suspension of food vouchers for @entity1 refugees because of a lack of funds			2
scenes of devastation inside @entity104 asked by @entity16 if he 'd survive this war -- or if he would have the same fate as once entrenched but later deposed leaders @entity141 in @entity29 and @entity142 in @entity143 -- @entity0 said , " the captain does n't think about death or life , he thinks about saving his ship			2
if he thinks about sinking , everyone will die			0
" @entity149 insisted that his goal has never been to remain president indefinitely , adding , " i am doing my best to save the country			1
" " regardless ( of ) what happens , we as @entity1 will never allow our country to become a toy in @entity34 hands , " he said			2
" it is a fundamental principle for us			0
