" my definition of fast food ? " @entity3 said			1
" letting someone loose in a garden with a bottle of balsamic vinegar and saying , ' have at it			2
' " " ( the price of ) fast food simply does n't take account of that meal 's true cost -- to soil , oil , public health , the public purse , etc , " @entity9 said			1
" costs which are never charged directly to the consumer but , indirectly and invisibly , to the taxpayer ( in the form of subsidies ) , the health care system ( in the form of food - borne illnesses ) and obesity , and the environment ( in the form of pollution )			1
not to mention the welfare of the workers in the feedlot and the slaughterhouse and the welfare of the animals themselves			2
" both these quotes are explanations of what 's wrong with the @entity41 diet , the aesthetic and the socio - ecologic			2
both are right on target ; both are compelling			2
yet both are completely powerless to bring about any sort of change in food policy			1
because tastebuds , food - borne illnesses , the environment and animal welfare do n't count			1
the food industry continues its juggernaut of revenues and profits			1
despite a sales dip at @entity62 , domestic fast food industry revenues have exhibited a 20 % rise , adjusted for inflation , over the past decade , according to @entity65 , a website that aggregates statistics from more than 18,000 sources			1
that 's despite a @entity71 population that grew by only 8.4 % over the same interval			0
fast food was worth $ 184 billion a year in 2010 , up from $ 165 billion in 2009 , and is projected to reach $ 210 billion in 2016 , according to @entity65			1
that pales in comparison to the total revenue of the entire food industry : $ 1 trillion			1
the @entity71 government has hitched its wagon to the food industry			1
our food is the cheapest in the world , made possible in part by federal subsidies to farmers			1
yet the @entity71 is the fattest country in the world			0
ok , then what about obesity and its associated diseases ? should n't that get @entity91 's attention ? after all , we annually waste $ 44 billion on disability , $ 73 billion in decreased work productivity and $ 190 billion in health care because of obesity			1
add to that a $ 2,741 increase in personal annual health insurance premiums to cover these costs , even for normal - weight adults			1
@entity101 will be broke by the year 2024			0
until we get a handle on obesity , all the @entity102 in the world ca n't stop the ravages of metabolic syndrome or the resultant health care expenditures			1
surely all that money is enough to offset the government 's margin on food ? unfortunately in the eyes of politicians , obesity remains an issue of " personal responsibility			1
" do n't blame the industry			2
just eat less and exercise more , they say			0
but then how do you explain our epidemic of obese 6 - month - olds ? they do n't diet and exercise			0
something more insidious is going on			0
how about the biochemical explanation ? would that hold any more sway with politicians ? scientific evidence now supports the concept that our glut of sugar -- in particular , the molecule fructose , which is what makes sugar sweet -- can trigger processes that lead to the metabolic syndrome			1
these include : -- hypertension -- fructose increases uric acid , which raises blood pressure			0
-- high triglycerides and insulin resistance through synthesis of fat in the liver			0
-- diabetes via increased liver glucose production combined with insulin resistance			0
-- the aging process , due to damage to lipids , proteins and dna through binding of fructose to these molecules			0
it can be argued that fructose exerts toxic effects on the liver similar to those of alcohol			0
furthermore , sugar , like alcohol , has a clear potential for abuse			0
@entity170 acts on the brain to encourage subsequent intake by dampening the suppression of the hunger hormone ghrelin			1
it also interferes with the hormone leptin , which helps produce a feeling of satiety and reduces dopamine signaling in the brain 's reward center , thereby reducing the pleasure derived from food			2
the majority of foods are laced with added sugar , thus effectively co-opting your choice			0
where there 's no choice , how can there be personal responsibility ? need more science ? how about the lack of fiber in the @entity41 diet , which was removed partially to increase shelf life ? lack of fiber in processed food means rapid absorption and overloading the liver , higher levels of " bad " cholesterol , proliferation of obesogenic bacterial species in the intestine , and slower transit of food through the intestine , delaying the onset of the satiety signal			1
here 's my definition of fast food : fiberless food			1
fast cooking ( white rice cooks in half the time of brown rice ) , and fast eating			2
and fast absorption from the @entity224 tract , overloading the liver , driving insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome , while increasing total food consumption			1
it 's a vicious cycle			0
so there you have it			0
a faustian bargain to be sure : your time or your health ; your wallet or your health			0
government 's job is to generate money			0
public health spends money , with the hope of eventually saving money			0
the food supply has not changed ; it has only gotten worse			2
public health policies for obesity prevention thus far have not worked , and the president and @entity247 ca n't justify spending more money on this			2
but both the science and the balance sheet say otherwise			0
robbing us to pay both @entity253 and @entity254			0
it 's time for government to step up and amend our current food policy â€” for the aesthetic , for the socio - ecologic and for the biochemical damage that it is doing to @entity71 .			2

the fast food industry continues its revenue and profit , doctor says
many politicians think obesity remains an issue of personal responsibility
@entity170 can trigger processes that lead to obesity , other diseases
