-- television viewers around the world were treated to the grudge match of the @entity4 as the @entity5 edged @entity6 in a thrilling ice hockey pool match in @entity8 this month			1
even for those not familiar with the rules , the sheer drama of the sporting contest was gripping and it made for compulsive viewing			0
it 's not the only time this year that ice hockey has made for a stunning spectacle and generated huge interest			1
in @entity21 -- ahead of @entity8 's start -- the @entity19 went on a big marketing blitz , with outdoor matches in massive stadiums previously used for other sports			1
some 106,000 hardy souls braved brutal subzero temperatures at the @entity28 in @entity29 on @entity30 and over 8.2 million watched the telecast			0
" we want to give our fans the most remarkable two months in the history of the league , " @entity19 commissioner @entity32 announced after the @entity33 beat the @entity34 3 - 2 in the annual showdown			1
then , ahead of the @entity40 's @entity39 , the @entity41 in @entity42 -- an iconic baseball venue -- was packed out for another clash in the @entity19 's " @entity45 " to underline the popularity of these events			2
so , with a growing audience among casual sports fans in its traditional markets and now a global audience watching the best of the best competing for their countries , can ice hockey capitalize on this popularity and go truly global ? for now , the @entity19 is coy about any expansion plans , but a spokesman told @entity0 : " we have a long history of playing games in @entity60 and are working with the @entity61 ( @entity62 ) to formulate a comprehensive calendar of games and activities in @entity60			1
" international hockey , and the growth of international hockey , we 've always identified as a real opportunity for continued growth of this game			0
now might be the most opportune time to seize on it			0
" from the @entity62 's point of view , it believes there is a real window of opportunity offered by @entity8			2
" the @entity4 will be a great platform to showcase the players and the sport at this best - on - best tournament , " its executive director @entity78 told @entity0			1
" there is a lot of opportunity to continue to grow our game not only in @entity21 , but internationally as well			0
" all that points to a revival of the @entity90			2
the successor to the @entity93 ( 1976 - 91 ) it has not been staged since 2004 , when @entity94 beat @entity95 in the final			0
the only other year it was held was 1996 , when the @entity5 triumphed			0
" we are working with the @entity19 to bring back the tournament , while establishing a long - term international hockey calendar , " @entity78 said			1
@entity101 , a former @entity103 silver medalist for @entity94 who now acts as an agent for more than 200 players , said he would be in favor of a return of the @entity90 because of its traditions			1
" that 's classic hockey , so to me there 's some value in it , " he told @entity0			0
" one - offs " such as a @entity90 may well help spread ice hockey 's appeal , but can the @entity19 follow the @entity40 's lead and stage regular - season games in other countries ? @entity120 is already openly talking up the possibility of a gridiron franchise in @entity123 after the success of taking teams to the @entity127 capital			1
@entity78 believes that if the @entity40 can expand its fan base so aggressively outside of the @entity5 then the @entity19 should be even better placed			2
" of the four major sports in @entity21 , the @entity19 is situated best to grow there , as there is great support for hockey already in @entity60 and we have a lot of international players in our game , " he said			1
" the players feel strongly we need to continue to grow our sport internationally			0
" @entity101 , who was a goaltender in the @entity94 squad for the 1994 @entity141 , sounds a note of caution			0
the 44 - year - old is concerned that the traveling involved if a @entity60 - style division is put in place would place intolerable demands on the game 's elite stars			0
" i think they would love the idea but in an @entity19 season you are talking about a sport where there are over 90 games in an eight - and - a - half - month period , " he said			1
" in the @entity40 it 's just one game a week , so it 's a bit different			0
" @entity101 says occasional regular - season games in cities like @entity123 may offer a better way forward to help spread the influence of the sport			0
he also floats the idea of a preseason tournament involving the top @entity60 teams taking on the cream of the @entity19			2
" the best teams in the world playing in a series , i would have an interest in watching that , " he said			0
whatever the future holds for expansion plans , the @entity19 is thriving financially off the back of recent commercial deals			1
television and broadcast rights in hockey - mad @entity94 alone for the next 12 years were sold for an eye - watering $ 5.2 billion			2
@entity19 deputy commissioner @entity181 shares his boss @entity32 's optimism over the game 's health , citing a " great season " last year capped by @entity186 ' 4 - 2 win over @entity187 in the @entity188			2
" on the franchise ownership front we 're clearly more stable than any time in my time with the league ( he joined in 1996 ) and concluded a landmark television deal , " @entity181 said			0
the 2013 - 14 regular season has taken a break from february 9 - 26 while its best players headed to @entity6 to represent their countries in the quest for gold			1
seven @entity19 referees and six linesmen also lent their expertise for the 12 - team men 's tournament and eight - nation women 's event , though the @entity4 were played under the auspices of the @entity209 ( @entity209 )			1
a slightly wider and longer rink was used in @entity8 and the playing regulations also differed slightly from the @entity19 , but the uninitiated spectator at the venues or on television would have noticed little difference			1
what they witnessed was the world 's top professionals battling for gold , although it 's only since the 1998 @entity221 that the @entity19 has released its players for the competition			1
before each @entity4 there have been reports that the arrangement could come to an end			2
some @entity19 franchises were opposed to allowing star players to compete for fear of midseason injury , but it has been maintained			2
with over 50 million television viewers in @entity21 alone watching @entity234 give @entity94 an overtime victory over its neighbors in the 2010 @entity103 final , it is difficult to argue a case against participation			0
@entity234 was a hero again with the second goal against @entity241 as @entity94 took gold for the second straight @entity4 in @entity8			1
but the tournament was notable for the strong performances of @entity60 nations , with @entity241 handicapped by the loss of three key players in the final , while @entity95 thrashed the @entity5 in the bronze medal match			0
in the women 's tournament , @entity94 beat the @entity5 in the final , but @entity252 took the bronze			0
whether this is enough to prompt the spread of ice hockey into more uncharted territory , only time will tell			1
@entity101 , who has played in @entity258 and @entity259 , believes there is " some potential " to move into markets in @entity263			0
closer to home , he also wants the @entity19 to license more franchises in the @entity5 because he has seen for himself the quality and depth of players now available , many of whom are on his books .			2

@entity19 took a *17* - *day* break during the @entity4 in @entity8
its top players competed for their *respective* countries in quest for gold
