@entity0 are coming back to @entity2			1
the animals , indigenous to the country , were completely wiped out by 1982			1
now , thanks to the combined effort of several private and public bodies , they are making a comeback			0
about 110 miles ( 177 kilometers ) north of the capital @entity11 lies the privately own , non-profit @entity12 , 7,000 hectares of suitable savannah and native woodlands			0
six southern white rhinos were introduced here in 2005			1
these rhinos are heavily protected			1
a 2 meter electric fence surrounds the whole 70 square kilometer sanctuary , and the animals themselves are kept under armed guard at all times			1
a team of about 70 park rangers and guards tracks the herd 's movements and follows them around , even at night			1
to avoid scaring the rhinos or interfering with their lives , the guards use bird - like noises to communicate			1
also , keeping quiet is essential to avoid giving away the animals ' location			1
they are entitled to shoot if they encounter armed poachers			0
so far , none have entered the sanctuary			1
the original group was composed of four animals from @entity44 , bought from the @entity45 in the @entity46 , and two from the @entity48 , donated by @entity50 's @entity49 in @entity51			2
the first birth was in 2009 : the mother was from the @entity48 and the father from @entity44 , so the calf was called @entity56			0
but the six were evenly split between females and males , which caused a bit of a problem			0
a group needs more females to allow for a dominant male : the gender balance causes too much fighting			0
before they can be reintroduced into the wild , the program needs to reach a minimum of twenty animals , with ideally a five - to - one ratio between cows and bulls			2
the surrounding land has been ravaged by poachers in the past decades , but it was n't just the animals suffering			2
plants have also been collected to the point of extinction			2
locals have used medicinal plants as remedies for various ailments for centuries , but now people are collecting them for commercial gain			2
and unlike rhino horns , which are used in alternative medicine without any scientific backing whatsoever , some of these plants have been shown to be effective in lab tests , for example in increasing sperm count in mice			0
add to that the illegal cutting for firewood , and vegetation is disappearing at an alarming pace , hurting both the land and the local populations who depend on it			0
it wo n't be easy to reverse the damage , but identifying the problem is a good way to start			0
fixing it will require patience and a coordinated effort			0
just like with rhinos , which are coming back to @entity2 one calf at a time .			1
