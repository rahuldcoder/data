-- @entity1 , an enigma to visitors and scientists alike for so many years , became less of a mystery after a discovery announced to the world this week			1
a stone circle discovered near @entity1 may suggest the prehistoric monument was part of a funeral route			1
archaeologists have unearthed a new stone circle near @entity1 that lends credence to the theory that the famous prehistoric monument in @entity17 was part of a funeral complex			1
@entity21 archaeologist @entity20 described the new find as " incredible " because it establishes @entity1 as part of a larger ceremonial complex linked to the nearby @entity25			0
" no one could have predicted there was another stone circle so close by , " said @entity20 , co-director of the excavation project that began in 2004			1
this , he said , changes the perception of the popular tourist destination 90 miles west of @entity33			0
the new find , dubbed " @entity39 " after the color of the 25 @entity37 stones of which it was once composed , sits along the @entity25 a mile away from its famous sister circle , @entity20 said			1
@entity42 peoples would have come down river by boat and literally stepped off into @entity39 , @entity20 said			0
they may have congregated at certain times of the year , including the winter solstice , and carried remains of the dead from @entity39 down an almost two - mile funeral processional route to a cemetery at @entity1 to bury them			1
" it could be that @entity39 was where the dead began their final journey to @entity1 , " said @entity51 , an archaeologist at the @entity52 who co-directed the project with @entity20			1
" not many people know that @entity1 was @entity17 's largest burial ground at that time , " he said			2
" maybe the blue stone circle is where people were cremated before their ashes were buried at @entity1 itself			1
" proof of life artifacts -- pottery , animal bones , food residues and flint tools used in the @entity69 -- are decidedly absent at @entity1 but were found upstream in a village discovered by the excavation team in 2005 , leading researchers to believe that @entity1 was indeed a burial ground			2
but people have debated the purpose of @entity1 for decades			2
known for its orientation in relation to the rising and setting sun , the circle of stones represented a prehistoric temple to some			2
others argued it was an astronomical observatory			1
or that it was a marker of time			0
but @entity20 is sticking to his theory			0
he said others have not based their suppositions on archaeological finds			0
archaeologists began the latest excavation with the hope of tracking the course of the avenue that led to @entity1			0
they had no idea they would stumble upon a second circle that would help uncover the mystery of @entity1			0
the stones at @entity39 were removed thousands of years ago , @entity20 said , but the sizes of the remaining pits , about 33 feet in diameter , point to giant blue stones from the @entity106 , about 150 miles away			2
@entity20 said that @entity42 people dragged the pillarlike blue stones along the processional route to @entity1 to incorporate them in a major rebuilding that took place around 2500 @entity91 know that after 2500 , @entity1 consisted of about 60 @entity37 stones and 83 local sarsen stones			1
some of the blue stones that once stood on the river 's edge probably now stand within the center of @entity1 , @entity20 said			2
scientists plan to use radiocarbon dating techniques to better understand the history of the entire site			0
@entity1 remains as striking as ever			0
but with each new find , the enigma fades just a little .			0

discovery of lost stone circle sheds new light on @entity1 's purpose
researchers say " @entity39 " was starting point of funeral processional route
@entity39 is named after color of @entity37 stones from which it was formed
some have *viewed* @entity1 as temple , astronomical observatory
