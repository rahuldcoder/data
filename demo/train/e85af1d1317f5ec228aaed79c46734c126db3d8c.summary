-- @entity3 's status a business superpower is transferring to the sporting world -- and its golfing ambitions took another step towards the big leagues on sunday			2
organizers of the @entity10 tournament announced that it has been upgraded to a full @entity14 @entity13 event , and will become part of the schedule for the prestigious end - of - season @entity18 playoffs			1
the tournament , which is already one of the four @entity22 events played each year , will boost its prize fund from $ 7 million this year to $ 8.5 million			1
next year it will return to the @entity24 in @entity25 , where it was held for from 2005 - 2011 before going to @entity27 in @entity28 for this week 's staging -- which was won by @entity31 @entity30 on sunday			1
" this is not so much a renewal as a rebirth -- it 's a new dawn for @entity10 champions and for @entity41 golf which is now right at the top table of world golf , " said @entity32 , head of sponsorship for the @entity36 multinational bank			1
" when we first came to @entity3 in 2005 , our ambition was to create a world - class international golf tournament in an emerging market			1
eight years on and the @entity10 , complete with full @entity18 points and an increased prize fund , is up there with the very best , and today 's announcement represents a major step forward for golf in @entity3			1
" our involvement in golf at this elite level is underpinned by our continuing sponsorship of youth development and grassroots programs , including the @entity58			0
" @entity3 soccer clubs have recently been investing large amounts in foreign players and coaches , but golf has been steadily developing in the country for the past decade -- especially with the sport returning to the @entity65 in 2016			2
" we hope the event will continue to play an important role to help grow the game of golf and improve the competition level of @entity3 , " said general @entity66 , executive vice-president and secretary of the country 's golf association			1
@entity3 's development is already showing , with 14 - year - old @entity75 poised to make more history next year when he becomes the youngest player to start at the prestigious @entity78 in april			2
he qualified by winning the @entity79 on sunday , having already been the youngest player to line up at a @entity81 event at this year 's @entity82			0
the @entity10 tournament had previously been co-sanctioned by the @entity41 and @entity84 , and has been won by top golfers such as @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
@entity30 became the first @entity31 to win two @entity22 events as he followed up his 2010 success at the @entity92 by coming from behind to snatch the title on sunday			1
the world no. 26 , a hero of the @entity98 team 's @entity96 victory in september , went into the final round four shots off the lead but fired a superb seven - under - par 65 to win by two and claim the $ 1.2 million first prize			0
" i 've already spent the check last week			0
i 'm not going to tell you what it is until it arrives and i 've got it home safe and sound , but yes , it was a vehicle , and yes , it was very expensive , " he told reporters , having also finished fourth at the lucrative @entity106 in @entity25 last weekend			0
" i definitely think it is a part continuation of the @entity96			0
i played great and i felt like i holed putts at the right time , which i did			0
" it was @entity30 's 12th @entity81 win and lifted him up to fourth in the race to @entity120 standings ahead of next week 's @entity121 -- where world no. 1 @entity122 will return to action			0
the @entity125 winner took the risk of skipping the @entity10 in order to rest , but remains on course to add the @entity81 money list crown to his @entity13 title after closest challenger @entity132 could finish only 24th equal with third - placed @entity133 on sunday			1
the @entity134 has a lead of more than â ‚ ¬ 800,000 ( $ 1 million ) with three tournaments to play before the $ 8 million finale in @entity120 at the end of this month			0
@entity30 's second successive 65 left him clear of @entity14 @entity96 rival @entity140 , who also surged up the leaderboard with a 64 , @entity86 ( 68 ) , @entity144 's @entity36 open champion veteran @entity143 ( 67 ) and another @entity14 , @entity145 ( 65 )			1
@entity146 and @entity147 had held a three - shot lead after saturday 's third round , but ended up tied for sixth on 18 under -- three behind @entity30 -- after slumping to 72s			0
former world no. 1 @entity146 again fell short on the big stage -- he has never won a major , and this was his 41st attempt to win a @entity22 title			2
@entity147 won his first major at the @entity157 , and like that tournament the @entity144 held a five - shot lead at the halfway stage here , but the world @entity161 was unable to add to his two titles this year			2
