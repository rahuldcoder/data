@entity0 -- there is a new grounds crew at the @entity4 in @entity0 but these landscapers do n't bring lawn mowers , just their appetites			1
about 30 goats were released into an overgrown area adjacent to the cemetery on wednesday and another trailer full were waiting to join them later			1
the assignment for these four - legged landscapers : eat the invasive plant species weighing down trees			0
if no action is taken the trees could eventually fall and destroy historic gravesites			2
a little camera shy , the goats were hesitant to emerge before a crowd of children and reporters			2
owner , @entity25 reassured his goats , coaxing some of them out individually by name			2
" you get a name if you 've got a lot of charisma or if you are a real pain in the butt , " @entity25 joked later			0
but soon after a glimpse of the all - you - can - eat buffet which awaited them , the goats were out and busy chowing down			2
these goats will continue grazing in an enclosed area next to the cemetery for the six or seven days			1
during that time , they will eat almost anything they encounter , including flowers , vines , brush , and bark			0
special enzymes in their stomach allow goats to eat plants that are poisonous to humans and other animals			1
" @entity55 is probably their favorite , " explained @entity25			0
the @entity4 is still in use today			0
it is the final resting place for many 19th century military heroes , congressmen , and political figures including two vice presidents and a @entity65 justice			0
since the grounds are located within the @entity68 , the goats are an environmentally friendly alternative to using pesticides , herbicides or machinery that could produce pollution			1
light on their feet , the goats are also much gentler on the ground than heavy machinery			2
and it 's cost effective , too			0
@entity80 , president of the @entity4 , said that employing 70 goats for a week will cost the cemetery about $ 4,000			1
" that comes down to about 25 cents an hour per goat			0
" this money saving technique is apparently not new in @entity0			1
during @entity88 , sheep could be found grazing on the @entity90 of the @entity91 to save money and manpower			1
their wool was auctioned to raise money for the @entity97			0
members of the cemetery grounds crew do n't have to worry about losing their jobs just yet			0
@entity80 said that they will continue to use lawn mowers to maintain the actual historic burial sites .			1
