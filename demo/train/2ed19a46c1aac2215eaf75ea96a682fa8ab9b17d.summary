@entity0 -- one of the perennial criticisms of @entity3 is that , for a song contest , the compositions are seldom very memorable			0
but for the millions who tune in each year , drawn to the promise of outrageous outfits and performances , the contest is as much about spectacle as it is about the music			1
for diehard fans , what an artist wears can be a bigger talking point than what they sing			1
the more misguided an outfit , the better			2
in 1997 , fan website @entity19 founded the " @entity21 , " an annual prize for the worst dressed artist			1
the award was named after a @entity26 singer who appeared in the 1993 competition wearing an unflattering homemade dress			1
@entity29 : @entity31 's not - so - guilty @entity3 pleasure " her song was n't at all bad , but her performance was overshadowed by that awful self - made dress , and as a result she ended up last , " said @entity32 , who runs the fan site			1
attention - grabbing outfits have always been part of @entity3 's dna			1
@entity44 's 1958 entry @entity42 performed wearing a sash saying " @entity46 , " and brandishing vinyl records at the audience			1
but the past 15 years have seen the costumes reach new heights of flamboyance			0
" visuals have become so much more important since televoting was introduced in 1998 , " said @entity52 , a writer for @entity53 , one of the most popular @entity3 fan websites			1
" acts only have three minutes to get their song heard and their message across , and they have to compete against 25 other songs to be remembered , " he said			0
" i think that 's why so many acts have gimmicks on stage -- and an outrageous costume is just another gimmick			2
it 's all part of the glitz and the glamor of the contest too , and i think that 's why people love @entity3			2
" but dressing up as a bird , butterfly or robot does n't guarantee success			0
many of the acts featured in our gallery finished near the bottom of the table , or failed to progress past the semi-finals			0
" a terrible outfit can destroy any chances a song may have had , " said @entity52			2
" i remember watching rehearsals in @entity89 in 2010 when the @entity91 entrant @entity92 came on stage with her backing dancer dressed as a massive bird			0
the whole press center was in howls of laughter , " he said			0
" it was quite highly regarded before then , but i really think that big bird put paid to the song 's chances			0
