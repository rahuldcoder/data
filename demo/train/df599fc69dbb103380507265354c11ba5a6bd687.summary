-- if @entity2 and @entity3 become friends , will you like it ? for the past couple of years , the potential for @entity2 to go public has been bandied about a lot in tech circles , with more and more of the digital tea leaves suggesting that the social - networking juggernaut will , in fact , one day become a publicly traded commodity			1
the speculation has heated up again this week			0
and , amid all the chatter about financial disclosures and initial public offerings , another question has emerged : what would it mean for the average @entity2 user ? the @entity21 this week quoted unnamed sources who said @entity2 is " inching closer " to a public offering , in spring or early summer , that would value the company at more than $ 100 billion			1
according to the report , @entity2 would look to raise a staggering $ 10 billion during its initial public offering			1
a $ 100 billion valuation would price the social - networking giant at more than twice the value of tech institutions such as @entity31 and @entity32 , the @entity21 reported			1
a @entity2 spokesman declined to comment for this article			1
for folks who have followed @entity2 's now - iconic rise from dorm - room project to online hangout for more than 800 million users , the money talk may be all well and good			1
but some of them say they are concerned that , when the stock shares start hitting the market , the ingenuity that built @entity2 could disappear			2
@entity47 writer @entity46 was n't optimistic in a post bluntly titled " @entity49 and a $ 100 billion ipo could hurt @entity2			1
" @entity46 argues that if @entity2 becomes beholden to stockholders , the site would be less free to innovate and would need to make profit a more important consideration than user experience			1
in other words , it could mean more ads popping up on users ' pages , for example			2
" ( @entity63 ) utside stockholders could detract from @entity2 's vision and momentum , " he wrote			1
" they could push for faster returns , and pressure the company to display more ads , turn mobile into a direct revenue stream , and play it safe with product			0
this might produce short - term gains , but could hamper what ceo @entity74 has built into a core communications utility for the world			0
" @entity46 cited @entity2 changes such as the @entity79			2
it 's hard to fathom now , but in 2006 when the site 's centerpiece feature rolled out , it was a radical departure			0
if short - term stock price had been the site 's prime concern then , he says , @entity2 may have hesitated to make such a change			2
" changes that disrupt user behavior and ask people to be more open might cause temporary stock price dips ( stockholders ) do n't want , " he wrote			0
" instead , they could turn @entity2 into @entity97 , slowing innovation and making it vulnerable to more agile competitors			1
" at @entity102 , @entity101 had a more upbeat take , writing that a @entity2 flush with new cash could be good for innovation			1
" why ? because the @entity106 could mean more and bigger startup acquisitions , more support for more startups and an infusion of smart money and experience into radically new tech experiments			2
" @entity101 notes that @entity2 's ipo documents would detail how it plans to spend the money it raises			2
" if the company signals then that more and bigger acquisitions are an important part of its strategy , that alone will be good news for startups , " he wrote			0
@entity121 , an analyst with @entity122 who specializes in online commerce , has a take that jibes with some of both arguments			0
" the biggest con of going public is quarterly investor scrutiny and the pressure that puts on short - term goals , " she told @entity0			0
" the biggest pro is generally the liquidity it offers shareholders , including employees , but in @entity2 's case , that may not be such a big benefit as the shares are already being exchanged in the private market			2
" in a financial landscape dominated by quarterly earnings reports , she said it would n't be enough for @entity2 to make money			0
to keep @entity3 happy , it would continually have to make more money than it did the quarter before			0
" the impact on users is that @entity2 will face significant pressure to grow quarter over quarter -- that may degrade the user experience if the way to achieve that is to blast more useless ads to users , " she said			1
" the biggest challenge for @entity2 over time will be to continue to engage users and not alienate them			1
" and about that $ 100 billion price tag ? she says it 's not out of the question			1
" even @entity161 , which is horribly unprofitable and has a questionable business model , has a market cap now more than $ 10 billion , " she said			0
" is @entity2 worth 10 times that ? yes , because it makes much more money than @entity161 , has far fewer employees , a stronger management team and a clear target market in display advertising			0
" on the other hand , is @entity2 worth more than @entity170 , or a third of @entity172 ? that remains to be seen			0
we 're not exactly in a rational market right now			0

questions arise over what a publicly traded @entity2 would mean to users
some fear a *constant* need to please stockholders would mean less innovation and more ads
others say a cash infusion would be good for startup companies @entity2 may *buy*
the @entity21 : @entity2 will go public next year at $ 100 billion valuation
