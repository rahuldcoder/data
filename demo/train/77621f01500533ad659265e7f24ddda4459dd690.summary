-- it 's an annual spectacle of diplomacy , dialogue and debate : the @entity6 session			1
international leaders shake hands , sip tea , catch up			0
sometimes resolutions are passed ; many times they are n't			0
this week , almost 200 countries will step up to the global stage again to tell the world what they want			2
here are five things to look for during the session that begins tuesday in @entity18 : 1			0
the @entity20 conundrum it 's been a hot topic for two years , yet not much has been accomplished			1
but there 's a new sense of urgency to reach a deal on @entity20 , now with the confirmed use of chemical weapons and the threat of @entity30 hanging over diplomats ' heads			1
in an ideal world , the @entity33 would agree on what to do about @entity20 , where more than 100,000 people have died in the two - year - long civil war			1
but the @entity20 conundrum is like a boxing match with unlimited rounds			1
in one corner , countries like the @entity41 and @entity42 want @entity20 president @entity44 to step down			1
at the very least , they want to be able to use force if the regime does n't give up all its chemical weapons			0
in the other corner , @entity49 and @entity50 wo n't stand for any strong action against their ally			0
@entity20 has agreed to a @entity49 - @entity41 timeline for the removal of its chemical weapons , but the plan has to be sanctioned as a @entity6 resolution			1
and since the two sides ca n't agree on whether to include the threat of force in the resolution , we 'll see if the sparring countries can hammer out a deal before time runs out -- or before more bodies pile up			0
the @entity69 overture it 's become as predictable as @entity6 's meeting itself : @entity69 's president take the mic , and diplomats walk out of the room in protest			1
but this year , the @entity79 - denying , @entity78 - baiting @entity77 is gone			0
in his place is @entity69 's new president , @entity81 , who has said he wants to mend fences			1
" we must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart , " @entity81 wrote in the @entity83 last week			1
@entity41 officials are skeptical about the outreach			0
they want @entity69 to walk the walk -- not just talk the talk -- on halting nuclear enrichment			1
but @entity69 's charm offensive , apparently spurred by tough economic sanctions , has spurred speculation that @entity81 and @entity41 president @entity95 will meet at the @entity6			1
if they do , it 'll be the first meeting between @entity100 and @entity69 presidents since @entity69 's @entity101			1
there 's no such meeting on the schedule			2
but the @entity105 says it has n't ruled one out , either			0
no @entity69 meeting yet , but @entity95 's @entity6 visit will center on @entity109 region @entity81 will address the @entity6 on tuesday			1
diplomatic corridors are abuzz with speculation that he 'll make a dramatic announcement , perhaps offering to close an nuclear enrichment plant or allow inspectors in			2
we doubt anyone will be walking out			0
the @entity109 dilemma will @entity119 get a step closer this year to becoming a recognized member state ? last year , @entity119 won recognition from the @entity6 as a non-member state			0
the upgraded diplomatic status gave them access to @entity6 bodies			0
it also raised concerns in @entity129 that @entity119 would seek membership in agencies such as the @entity132 , where it can press for war crimes charges against @entity129			1
this year 's agenda will include talks on the " permanent sovereignty of the @entity119 people in the @entity138 , including @entity139 , and of the @entity141 population in the occupied @entity142 over their natural resources			2
" @entity95 will meet with @entity146 president @entity145 , the first time the two have met since direct @entity109 peace negotiations restarted earlier this year			2
@entity129 prime minister @entity149 is scheduled to visit the @entity105 at the end of the month			0
the @entity152 tension things could get awkward when @entity41 diplomats run into some of their @entity100 counterparts			0
@entity157 had a falling out with @entity158 over reports that the @entity41 was electronically spying on the its president 's communications			1
both countries agreed to postpone @entity157 president @entity164 's state visit to @entity158 in october to a later date			1
@entity166 is n't exactly happy with the @entity41 , either			0
last week , the government accused the @entity41 of refusing to allow its president 's plane to fly through @entity41 airspace while en route to @entity50			1
the @entity171 denied the claim , saying it granted permission for the plane to fly over @entity175			0
the no - show ... and the not wanted not all the 193 countries will be represented in @entity18			2
@entity178 recalled its envoy , @entity179 , because deputy president @entity180 has been on trial at the @entity132 for alleged crimes against humanity			2
" we very much regret that he can not be out of the country at the same time as the deputy president , " @entity178 @entity185 spokesman @entity184 said in a statement			2
the @entity6 court accuses @entity180 of plotting attacks that killed more than 1,000 people after @entity178 's disputed presidential election almost six years ago			2
another leader the @entity132 would like to get its hands on is @entity196 's president			1
he 's wanted for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in a five - year campaign of violence in @entity205			1
but president @entity206 might show up anyway			0
" as i 've said numerous times , he has submitted a visa application			0
we 're not going to sort through the considerations underway right now on that application publicly , " @entity171 spokeswoman @entity210 said friday			0
there 's little the @entity41 can do			0
as the host country , it 's generally obligated to grant visas to heads of state , wanted or not			2
@entity0 's @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .			0

the global debate over @entity20 is expected to be a hot topic
@entity81 will make his first appearance as @entity69 's new president
@entity196 's president , wanted on charges of war crimes , might make a *surprise* appearance
