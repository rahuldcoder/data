-- not in a long time has the @entity2 chatter been so dominated by one player 's body part			0
but sunday 's game in @entity7 has turned into the saga of the injured ankle of @entity10 superstar tight end @entity11			1
while pundits are split on who will clinch the big game between the @entity10 and the @entity15 , most agree that the @entity10 will be severely hobbled if @entity11 ca n't take to the field			1
@entity11 suffered a devastating ankle sprain in the @entity10 ' playoff win against the @entity19 on january 22			1
last week , he was sporting a protective boot over his ankle that he took off monday , but was still unable to practice most of the week			0
at media day tuesday , @entity11 said he was n't sure if he could play sunday			1
" i do n't know yet , " @entity11 said			1
" i am not really worried yet if i am playing or not			0
we 're going day by day			0
i am taking new steps every day			0
i am feeling better every day			0
that is a positive sign			0
i want to be out there with the team obviously			0
" @entity11 tallied 17 touchdown catches this season - an @entity31 record -- and is a match up nightmare for any defense			1
he stands 6 - foot - 6 and packs a hard - to - handle mix of power and speed			0
he could be the @entity10 ' most valuable player after quarterback @entity38			2
the dominating conversation about @entity11 's status is reminiscent of the lead up to the @entity43 game in 2005 when then - @entity45 wideout @entity44 miraculously came back from a severe ankle injury to play in the game			1
he caught nine passes for 122 yards , but the @entity45 lost the game to the @entity10			2
that was also the last @entity43 the @entity10 won			2
the @entity10 have appeared in the big game more times than any other team since 1986 , and is only the second team in the game 's history -- after the @entity57 -- to win three @entity43 championships in four years			2
seven years later , the @entity10 are hoping to do it again			1
" @entity11 is in the training room every day trying to get ready , " @entity38 said			2
" he wants to be there			0
he 's going to work his butt off to be there			0
" @entity15 defensive lineman @entity64 hopes not			1
" hopefully that ankle hurts a little more than everyone expects it to and he is not as versatile as he has been , " @entity64 told @entity65			1
" you talk about the talent that he is , he had probably the best year for a tight end ever			1
" no matter what the @entity10 do on offense , the key for the @entity15 lies with their defense , pundits say			1
the @entity15 beat the @entity10 in 2008 @entity43 , throwing cold water on the @entity10 ' undefeated season			1
in that game , the @entity79 's ferocious defensive line rushed @entity38 and sacked him five times			0
" no one has been able to figure that out all year , " said @entity38 , referring to the @entity15 ' defensive line this year			2
" they can rush the quarterback really well and hopefully we can slow them down somehow			0
they are ready to go and ready to take my head off			0

@entity10 star tight end @entity11 hurt his ankle earlier in the playoffs
he says he does not know if he will play
" hopefully that ankle hurts , " @entity15 ' @entity64 says
the @entity15 beat the @entity10 in 2008 , and are hoping for a *repeat*
