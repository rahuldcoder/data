-- in the wake of the @entity3 and the global financial crisis , focus has been on the world 's new and so - called " disrupted society			1
" but i would avoid using such a negative phrase for @entity9 ; which is where i live and which has avoided the severity of the uprisings in other @entity14 countries			1
while some might point to a " disrupted society , " i call our world an " enriched and awakened society			1
" it is a society of potential , innovation , and opportunity			1
youth dominate the globe -- the 3.5 billion people under the age of 30 make up half of the world 's population			1
therefore , we have an impact on our own lives today , and we are the decision makers of our lives tomorrow			2
so how do we react to such opportunities , and what do we do with such potential that resides within us ? do we add water and sunlight so it can sprout , or do we suppress it with darkness and ignorance ? it is said that @entity45 youth have faced tough challenges since the @entity3			1
but this is not unusual			2
youth all around the world have faced unemployment , high tuition fees , and tough economic situations for years			2
it is these challenges that allow for innovation and creativity to be born			2
this is when and where we unleash our potential			2
@entity9 's youth are not completely satisfied with the performance of the public sector , nor are they satisfied with their ability to participate in the decision making process			2
these frustrations , coupled with difficult economic times , have created an unstable environment and resulted in the launch of initiatives to engage youth as active citizens in political , economic , and social decision - making			2
but unemployment in @entity9 and the @entity14 did not take us by surprise during the @entity3			1
high unemployment was present in the @entity14 , and in almost every country around the world , for many years before the uprising			2
the impact , however , has been far more painful as the world faltered under the economic downturn			2
the domino effect of the economic crisis hit the developed countries first , and then reached the developing nations of the @entity14			0
when it hit @entity9 it was , by coincidence , around the same time of the @entity3			1
therefore , it is important to note that the @entity3 was n't a mere result of unemployment , nor was it a complete call for democracy and freedom			1
the @entity3 was simply a call for change : change in ideologies , change in direction , change in hope			1
unemployment is a major issue in the @entity14 and @entity104 region , especially in @entity9			0
the official rate is 11 % , and unofficial estimates are about twice that figure			0
generous employment opportunities in the public sector have eased the pressure , but the debt crisis facing the government has been hindering its ability to help			0
policy makers are now pressed to come up with solutions to empower the private sector and improve the education system			0
many of the world 's young are uncertain of their future and their ability to find meaningful employment			0
@entity9 's young have some of the region 's most sought - after talents , due to their high quality of education and hard - working attitudes			0
regretfully , their productivity is not contributing to @entity9 's economy , as they can not find competitive salaries or similar opportunities			0
therefore , many look for jobs abroad , particularly in the @entity137			0
yet , there is still hope for @entity9			1
the entrepreneurship scene is expanding , and more of the country 's young are establishing companies			0
i believe the young can rise and flourish -- especially in today 's tough climate -- by thinking about their " sphere of influence			0
" we should collaborate with individuals from our region by crossing borders , creating partnerships , and exploring ideas			1
travel between @entity14 counties can be challenging due to visa requirements , but the virtual world eliminates such boundaries			0
technological advances unite us in ways we should be united			0
and we must remember that divided we are as fragile as separate fingers , but united we are a strong fist			0
three years ago , the @entity3 signified hope			1
now , @entity9 youth have witnessed the negative transformations in neighboring countries such as @entity166 and @entity167			0
@entity9 youth are smart and will not allow their country to head towards that same path			0
but the need for security and stability must be accompanied by reform and growth			0
i do not believe the @entity3 caused a " disrupted society			1
" rather , the @entity3 has created an opportunity that allows things " out of the norm " to occur			1
such an @entity3 encourages innovation and creativity ; it allows for thoughts and ideas to sprout that were once dormant			1
therefore , i advise my fellow @entity45 to prepare , strategize , and implement with utmost passion , wisdom , and honesty			0

@entity195 : @entity197 is " enriched and awakened society , " not a " disrupted society "
the @entity3 was simply a call for change , change in ideologies , change in direction , change in hope
@entity3 allows for thoughts and ideas to sprout that were once dormant , he *writes*
