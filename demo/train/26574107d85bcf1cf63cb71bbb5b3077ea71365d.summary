-- personal trainer @entity1 was working out with president @entity2 one morning when he had a revelation			1
" being a personal trainer is just like being the president , " @entity1 told @entity2 , whom he has trained for 11 years			1
that certainly got the president 's attention			0
" we 're faced with similar things , " @entity1 said			1
" we have people that come to us , and they 've created conditions or situations that maybe we 've had nothing to do with , and immediately they want us to change it			0
even if they do n't do what they 're supposed to , they 're upset with us when it 's not changed			0
so i thought our jobs were pretty similar			0
" @entity1 spoke at last month 's @entity21 conference in @entity22 , where he thanked fellow personal trainers who donated their time to help military families get fit			1
@entity1 splits his time between @entity27 and @entity28 , where he helps the @entity29 and key members of the administration stay in shape			1
the imposing former martial arts guru is one man in the world who can tell the president what to do -- at least when it comes to exercise			0
" if we 're short on time , we try to mix things up , " he said			0
" we 'll try to make sure there 's some high - intensity stuff			1
we might do some weights , throw some cardio in there and throw some plyometrics in there with abs. we go from one thing he needs to another , because his time is short			1
" the president is in tiptop shape age 50			0
@entity2 passed a physical exam in october with a healthy body mass index and normal blood pressure and cholesterol levels			1
the doctor wrote that @entity2 was in " excellent health and ' fit for duty			2
' " " i was very pleased , " @entity1 said			2
" we joked about it			0
" and @entity1 is no doubt pleased with @entity2 's much - coveted arms , which are so admired that they have spawned exercise dvds with titles like " arms of a first lady " and " totally toned arms : get @entity72 in 21 days			1
" although it 's easy to say that the presidential couple can get in shape easily because of their resources such as personal trainers and professional chefs , it 's not just about that			0
@entity1 said busy people can realistically integrate fitness into their lives because it 's a mental thing			1
" he is the busiest man in the world , " @entity1 said of the president			2
" i do n't have to prod him			0
" the excuses -- too busy , too little time -- just do n't fly with @entity1			2
long before the @entity91 , the @entity29 made their health a priority			2
@entity2 came to his @entity27 gym 14 years ago , and her husband joined about three years later			1
before she became first lady , she would go to @entity1 's gym as early as 4:45 a.m. it 's about a mindset , @entity1 said			2
" people have to first understand the benefits , " said @entity1 , who serves on the @entity100			0
by exercising and reaping its benefits on health and stress relief , he said , " it is how we can maintain these busy lives , and how we can sustain them			0

@entity1 has trained the @entity29 for over 10 years
the *biggest* *barrier* to exercise is mental , he said
