lifelong democrat @entity0 is doing something she never thought she 'd do : urge people to vote for a @entity3			1
@entity4 supports @entity5 , a six - term @entity6 senator who 's trying to fend off a fierce tea party challenge to his seat from @entity10 as voting got underway in tuesday 's primary runoff			1
two weeks ago , @entity4 helped put up 5,000 pro-cochran posters in black communities and talk to people about his record			0
" we wanted to raise the awareness to african - americans that we do have a stake in this runoff election , " she said			2
she pointed to @entity5 's efforts to secure federal funds for jobs , @entity24 programs and health centers relied upon by african - americans in the state			1
" we do n't want to move backwards , " she said			0
@entity4 's efforts reflect the high stakes locally and nationally in the @entity5 - @entity10 showdown and also illustrate the unscripted political realities of particular states that play out on @entity36			1
in this case , it 's apparent that @entity5 needs @entity39 to keep his job , and some @entity39 heed the fact that @entity44 @entity43 nominee @entity42 likely wo n't win in november , so they turn out for a @entity3			1
in @entity6 , neither candidate secured 50 % of the vote in the @entity3 primary this month , requiring a runoff election			1
and both sides over the past few weeks have relentlessly pursued get - out - the - vote efforts			2
unheralded candidate believes he played spoiler in @entity5 race @entity6 law allows anyone to vote in the runoff , meaning @entity39 can go to the polls so long as they did n't vote in the @entity44 primary and they do n't plan to support their party candidate in the general election			1
the question is whether @entity5 can shore up enough support to beat back the @entity8 wave against him			1
@entity10 got about 1,400 more votes than @entity5 in the primary , and national conservative groups have actively rallied around the challenger			1
@entity6 primary spending spree pushes advertisers off the air @entity5 is pushing his message that his experience makes him more influential in @entity73 , and his ties on @entity75 will better serve @entity6 if he 's reelected			1
@entity10 and allies , however , say @entity5 has been in office long enough , and his tenure only breathes more life to the status quo			1
for his part , @entity10 vows to bring change to the nation 's capital and shake things up on @entity75			1
" the people of this country are finally waking up again and recognizing that @entity89 's been broken for a long time , " @entity10 said monday , referring to tea party victories in recent years			1
" all the sudden you see a great awakening among all the people , particularly those who are very dissatisfied with the direction our country is going			0
" courting the @entity99 - @entity98 vote @entity6 conservatives , a super pac founded by former gov. @entity102 and his nephew , @entity103 , has taken the lead in courting votes from @entity39 , especially in the @entity99 - @entity98 community			2
@entity5 's allies are arguing the case that he has long been there for the voting bloc and would better represent their interests than @entity10			1
the issue is so complicated that even @entity4 can hardly stomach what she 's doing			2
she attended an event monday featuring @entity3 sen. @entity117 , who called on voters to keep @entity5 in @entity89 but also spent much of his speech blasting president @entity120			1
@entity4 , a supporter of the president , got up and left			0
@entity5 acknowledged monday he would likely benefit if a wide range of voters turn out for the runoff			1
" i 've always reached out and benefited from support from the black community , " he said			0
" my responsibility as a @entity98 senator has been to represent the people of the state of @entity6 , not just one party or one race or a select group of friends			2
" but another @entity6 political veteran labeled the vote courting a risky move			0
" it might get him some votes , but it might lose him some votes , " said former @entity137 sen. @entity137			2
the ex-senate majority leader not only served with @entity5 for many years , but the two were competitors for the leadership position in 1996			2
@entity137 now describes @entity5 as " a good friend " and said he 's " very nervous " about the runoff			1
it will be " difficult for @entity5 to overcome the momentum " by @entity10 , he predicted			1
vote underway conservative groups are working with @entity149 , a former @entity150 official , to train volunteers to monitor poll workers and make sure they check to see whether @entity39 have already voted in their primary			0
some critics question whether the effort might lead to voter intimidation			0
the @entity6 @entity157 dispatched about 250 volunteers to watch poll stations and look for any signs of interference			0
they 're supposed to call the state office if anyone is turned away , but enforcing the crossover primary rule may be hard to enforce			0
@entity165 , president the @entity157 's @entity166 , said the biggest concern is polling stations in rural areas			2
" there wo n't be much coverage as far as the news media out there , so those are the pockets where someone might figure they can get away with certain things , " he said			0
@entity165 said the state office had n't yet receive any calls or suspicious reports from any of the volunteers in the field			0
@entity182 saw three people turned away by poll workers in @entity185 because they voted in the @entity44 primary			0
monitoring crossover voters @entity149 is overseeing the " election integrity project " for the conservative groups @entity191 , @entity188 and @entity189 , said monday in a phone interview that volunteers wo n't be instructed to talk to voters or poll workers , but only monitor the process at polling stations across the state			0
" these are not negotiators , " he told @entity182 , stressing that they 're " not activists urging people " to vote one way or the other			0
he said the volunteers will " observe what 's going on and how to memorialize the events of the day in an observer report , " which will be reviewed by lawyers			2
but he refused to elaborate on who the lawyers are and who they work for			0
he also declined to be more specific about where exactly the volunteers would be working , saying only that they will be stationed at polling locations " across the state			0
" pressed on why he was providing few details about an effort that seeks transparency and honesty in an election process , @entity149 did n't give an answer			0
@entity10 , who chairs the elections committee in the @entity43 , said monday he approves of the monitoring effort and doubts intimidation will become an issue			2
" the issue is to make sure we have a fair process , " he said			0
he argued that a high @entity44 turnout for @entity5 would reveal the senator 's true colors			1
" i 'm not concerned about them being @entity99			0
i 'm concerned about them being liberal , " he told @entity182			0
" that 's always been my concern			2
if senator @entity5 is going to court @entity39 to save his seat , that 's a good indication that he 's abandoned conservatism in @entity6			1
" learning from last time since @entity5 failed to defeat @entity10 in the primary , the senator and his campaign have been more aggressive about their ground game			1
sources familiar with @entity5 's campaign strategy say they hope that a lot of @entity3 who stayed home during the primary , thinking @entity5 would be fine , will show up at the polls			1
the senator has had a more active schedule for the runoff and his overall operation is more finely tuned			0
on monday , he campaigned with @entity117 , who reiterated the pitch that an experienced senator is more beneficial for a state			0
@entity10 doubled down on his attack line against @entity5 , saying his partnership with @entity117 further proves how out of touch the senator is with conservatives			1
former sen. @entity137 has also helped out @entity5 by cutting an ad for his former colleague			1
he said he did n't do much for @entity268 in the primary because " i think they did n't think they needed me			0
" but the runoff 's been different			2
the @entity98 @entity273 also pitched in for @entity5 and produced an ad featuring retired @entity276 star @entity275 , a @entity6 native			2
but @entity5 is n't the only one with a celebrity endorsement			2
longtime game show host @entity279 headlined a bus tour organized by the @entity281			0
while @entity5 has tried to make the case that his near - four decades in the @entity43 brings wisdom and power , he 's fighting an uphill battle against a younger politician and former talk radio host who paints himself as the candidate more principled and eager to help lead a conservative movement in the @entity43			1
@entity290 , 20 , a student at the @entity291 and a @entity10 supporter , showed up to a @entity5 event monday			1
" i feel like it 's the same rhetoric , just washed and put in different clothes , " he told @entity182			0
" i mean he has no charisma , and as far as i 'm concerned , he could n't sell you a brand new car , even if it was free			0

@entity3 sen. @entity5 hopes @entity301 can help him keep his seat
@entity5 is in *bitter* runoff battle with tea party - backed challenger @entity10
@entity10 says @entity5 's long tenure in @entity89 makes him part of status quo
@entity5 is *banking* on that tenure , and the benefits it provides back home
