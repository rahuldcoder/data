-- a film poet and provocateur probably more famous for his bombed - out appearances on @entity5 , @entity1 made a name for himself in 1995 with " kids , " @entity9 's brutally unsentimental film about the teenage sex drive from a screenplay @entity1 had written when he was 18			1
fast - forward nearly two decades			0
@entity1 , now 40 , is no longer the enfant terrible			2
he 's married , a father , and perhaps starting to chafe against the marginalization that comes with such willfully independent ventures as " @entity15 , " " @entity16 " and " mister lonely			0
" his last film , " @entity19 , " was a fake found - footage romp about the exploits of senior citizens , hooligans who roamed the slums at night causing mayhem			0
it appeared on several critics ' best and worst films of the year lists but scarcely caused a blip on the mainstream cultural radar			0
@entity1 's new film , " @entity33 , " has already made a bigger splash and represents a rare potential intersection between the experimental art film and the multiplex			1
but it remains to be seen if fans of former @entity41 starlets @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 will be thrilled or scandalized by what they see			1
like " kids , " " @entity33 " suggests that young people behave very differently among their peers than they do with adults			1
although the @entity56 ( @entity57 ) eventually demurs , her college classmates @entity53 ( @entity54 ) , @entity50 ( @entity44 ) and @entity51 ( @entity52 , @entity1 's wife ) just say yes to any proposition that comes their way , no matter how sleazy			2
time and again , @entity1 cuts between the saccharine platitudes @entity56 feeds to her grandmother over the phone about how spring break in @entity66 has proved a positive and empowering experience , and rather less salubrious footage of the rampant hedonism , drug and alcohol abuse , and orgiastic all - night parties the friends indulge in ( some of which appears to be reality footage )			2
even before taking off for @entity66 , the girls stick up a restaurant to bankroll the trip			0
hard to imagine @entity80 putting on a latex face mask and yanking out an imitation automatic weapon back in her day			0
part cautionary tale , part leering , lascivious walk on the wild side , " @entity33 " does n't quite fit into a conservative " crime does not pay " mold , but when @entity56 resists the sweet advances dripped into her ear by @entity95 's tattooed , gold - toothed , corn - rowed drug dealer , a silver - tongued @entity93 who calls himself @entity96 , there is a palpable sense that virtue is its own reward			1
alien is a grotesque creation , a white rapper @entity101 who bails the girls out of jail when he learns they have nothing more than the bikinis they 're standing in			0
but in @entity1 's imagination these bored college kids are more debauched and dangerous than @entity96 dreams			1
shot in hot lurid pinks and greens by @entity115 ( " @entity116 " ) , " @entity33 " has the quality of a fever dream , a narcotic nightmare in which voices loop and echo into a mantra or a dirge , and weird , stunted , self - contained scenes slip in and out of focus			2
it 's a bad trip , but a trip with moments of blitzed out bliss -- like the odd , happy / sad communal moment around a grand piano , one of @entity96 's unexpected toys , when the dealer and his new entourage break into @entity135 ' " @entity134			0
" the scene perfectly encapsulates the perverse mixture of childish innocence and excess that interests @entity1 and which makes " @entity33 " something more than a subversive stunt -- an authentically cracked expression of the crazy , conflicting signals bombarding today 's teenagers .			1

@entity1 made a name for himself as a writer for the *controversial* ' *90s* film " kids "
" @entity33 " features @entity152 starlets @entity42 and @entity43
critic calls it a " rare potential intersection ' between art film and multiplex
