another debris field , another new and so - far futile focus in the search for @entity3			1
more than three weeks after the @entity6 jet disappeared , one thing has been made clear : the ocean is full of garbage , literally			1
" it is n't like looking for a needle in a haystack , " @entity10 senior scientist @entity9 said of the difficulty in finding the @entity13 aircraft			2
" it 's like looking for a needle in a needle factory			0
it is one piece of debris among billions floating in the ocean			1
" " one piece of debris among billions " environmentalists like @entity9 have warned for years that human abuse of the planet 's largest ecosystem causes major problems for ocean life and people that depend on it			1
with the world 's eyes now scouring @entity39 waters for any trace of the plane that was more than 240 feet long and weighed more than 700,000 pounds , the magnitude of the ocean debris problem has become evident			1
new search : nothing yet two objects floating in the southern @entity45 , including one nearly 80 feet long , initially were called the best lead to date when a satellite detected them last week			2
so far , though , search planes have yet to find them or any other plane debris , with speculation mounting that the larger item was a shipping container lost at sea			1
no definitive records exist , but estimates for how many containers go overboard range from about 700 to as many as 10,000 of the roughly 100 million that the @entity58 says get shipped each year			0
most ocean garbage comes from land lost containers are only a minor part of the problem			1
while ship waste also adds to ocean pollution , most of the garbage comes from land , @entity9 said			1
more than a third of the world 's 7 billion people live within 60 miles of an ocean coast , and their waste inevitably reaches the water -- either deliberately or indirectly			2
estimates from various sources , including the @entity78 government , indicate that more than 10 million tons of debris -- including houses , tires , trees and appliances -- washed into the sea in the 2011 tsunami			2
no answers yet as ships , planes search vast stretch of @entity45 in addition , discarded plastics -- including countless bags like the kind routinely provided by retail stores and fast food restaurants until a movement in recent years to decrease their use -- form huge , churning garbage fields in the rotating currents of ocean gyres			1
one in the @entity101 is estimated to be at least 270,000 square miles , or an area larger than @entity103			0
@entity9 said the plastic breaks down in the saltwater to form a kind of " plastic soup " that gets ingested by marine life			0
millions of sea turtles die from the plastic each year , he said , and one in 10 small bait fish has plastic in its stomach			0
that happens in the same waters that provide roughly 15 % of the animal protein consumed by people			0
the world 's " toilet " " the world does use the ocean as its toilet , and then expects that toilet to feed it , " @entity9 noted			0
many island nations and coastal cities lack infrastructure sophisticated enough to deal with all the waste produced , he said			0
in addition , much of that waste -- such as plastics -- now is so durable that it lasts for decades or longer in any environment			0
@entity9 cited @entity133 , @entity134 , as an example			0
considered the fastest growing city in the world , the capital of 15 million people could expand to more than 20 million people in the next decade , according to the @entity141			0
such growth far exceeds the capacity to deal with the garbage and sewage , @entity9 said , adding : " all that waste in countries like that -- low - lying , prone to flooding -- periodically flushes into the ocean			2
" live : latest updates on the missing @entity6 jetliner if this is the debris of @entity3 , what happens next ? difficulties may hamper flight 370 search opinion : search for @entity3 highlights need for trust , unity in @entity39			1

ocean debris *diverts* searchers for the missing @entity6 jetliner
for years , environmentalists have warned about *increasing* garbage in the ocean
most ocean debris , such as countless plastic bags , comes from land
