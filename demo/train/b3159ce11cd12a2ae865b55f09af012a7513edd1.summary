@entity22 , @entity23 : on @entity25 , online , on @entity26			1
however you 're watching us , thanks for checking out @entity0			1
bringing you today 's headlines , i 'm @entity32			1
first up : @entity33 @entity34 : first up , authorities have charged a man in @entity37 with planning to provide material support to terrorists overseas			1
the @entity42 attorney for @entity37 says @entity43 tried to get training from the @entity45 and hoped to attack members of the @entity42 government			2
the official added that those people were never in any danger			2
the @entity42 attorney claims that @entity43 , who you see in this file video , was involved in this conspiracy that lasted for about seven years			2
if he 's convicted on the material support charge , @entity43 could face up to 15 years in prison			2
@entity57 @entity34 : a new report says last year 's $ 700 billion could cost the government more than just money			2
@entity61 , who oversees the program for the @entity63 , says it could damage the government 's reputation with taxpayers , and there 's also a risk of rewarding companies that took big chances			2
the @entity72 , or @entity72 , was passed following last year 's financial crisis			2
its goal was to help struggling banks and companies			2
so far , about 17 percent of the loans that were given out as part of @entity72 have been repaid			2
@entity78 @entity34 : @entity79 has signed off on an agreement to send some of the uranium it makes to other countries for further enrichment			2
this was the result of talks between @entity79 , the @entity42 , @entity88 , @entity89 and the @entity90			2
@entity79 says part of the reason it accepted the deal was to prove that its nuclear activities are only for peaceful purposes			2
other nations have accused the @entity98 country of trying to develop nuclear weapons			2
@entity4 @entity2 @entity34 : president @entity100 says that the @entity42 will continue to work with the @entity4 government no matter who wins that country 's runoff election next month			1
as we told you about yesterday , the leading candidates from august 's election are going to take part in the runoff on november 7th			1
but as @entity112 explains , there are some potential problems in putting together an election that soon			1
( begin video ) @entity116 , @entity0 correspondent : @entity4 is trying to pull off an election on little more than two weeks ' official notice			1
and these are the problems it 's facing : logistics , lack of awareness , fraud and fear			1
@entity126 , @entity4 presidential candidate : the people of @entity4 were threatened			1
they lost their fingers in the last round of elections			2
@entity132 : ink - stained fingers were proof of voting , which made them targets of the @entity45			2
but a @entity42 defense official says there are more @entity42 and @entity4 troops in place now than in august			1
and a @entity141 official says they 're reducing the number of polling stations so security teams wo n't be spread so thin			1
on thursday , the @entity141 is launching tv and radio spots , trying to make voters aware there is another election			1
it 's not a given that people know ; less than 30 % of @entity4 can read			1
a high turnout and a safe election			1
those are fine goals for politicians and officials to have			2
but what about the @entity4 people , the ones who may be risking their lives to come out again to cast their vote ? we found mixed opinions in this crowded @entity167 market			1
@entity168 : we want to build up our country			2
so despite the problems , i will go to vote in the next election			1
@entity132 : officials threw out more than a million votes because of suspected fraud			2
and now , a @entity177 official says there will be far fewer election monitors for the runoff because the @entity177 ca n't deploy them all on such short notice			1
@entity132 : do you trust that your vote will be counted fairly ? @entity184 , kabul resident : uhhh , i do n't think so			2
@entity132 : and @entity186 ca n't see how president @entity187 or his challenger will improve security			0
@entity184 : and i 'm not sure dr. @entity126 will be able to stop the insurgency in @entity4 , or at least to limit the level of insurgency in @entity4			1
@entity132 : at the least , they want to limit the reach of that insurgency on election day			1
@entity112 , @entity0 , @entity167			0
( @entity197 ) @entity198 @entity199 , @entity23 : time for the shoutout ! who is the @entity42 secretary of health and human services ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity211 , b ) @entity212 , @entity213 ) @entity209 or @entity210 ) @entity208 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity211 heads up the @entity214 , which is responsible for protecting @entity42 ' health			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity7 @entity34 : and that puts @entity220 in charge of the @entity42 response to @entity7			0
@entity211 , who was recently treated for skin cancer above her eye , talked to a @entity226 committee yesterday about some of the differences between @entity7 and the seasonal flu			0
@entity42 secretary of health and human services @entity211 : half the hospitalizations for flu - like illness are for people under the age of 25 ; very different picture than seasonal flu			0
nearly 90 percent of the deaths from @entity7 are among people under 65			0
again , a very different picture than seasonal flu , where 90 % of the deaths year in and year out are for @entity42 over the age of 65			0
@entity34 : the @entity241 has classified @entity7 as a pandemic because of how far this thing has spread around the world			1
@entity0 's senior medical correspondent @entity245 shows us how germs like the @entity7 virus can transfer from person to person			1
( begin video ) @entity252 , @entity253 : let 's pretend that you and i are going to get on the subway			0
we stand in line at this kiosk , and let 's say i 'm sick			0
i go like this , i touch this , you 're right behind me , now it 's your turn			0
@entity266 @entity265 , georgia department of community health : and i 'm not so happy with you right now			0
what happens is , and commonly it happens every single day , is that people who have different illnesses , different symptoms , coughing , sneezing , runny nose , sinus infections , whatever , do the same thing you just did without even thinking about it			0
@entity7 virus can live on an inanimate object for 2 - 8 hours			0
this is a virus that our bodies have never seen before , so all those people who have touched it , if they have @entity7 , they have no immunity and neither do you			0
and this is where the adventure actually starts @entity293 : so , we are now standing behind a whole bunch of people			0
if one of them were sick and sneezed , could we get sick ? @entity299 : yes , we can			0
@entity293 : even at this distance ? @entity299 : it 's less than six feet			0
so that spray , the air droplet spray , could actually come into your being			0
you 're inhaling , you 're breathing respiratory droplets			0
( @entity197 ) no more fountains @entity34 : a few moments ago you heard @entity220 mention it			0
the @entity7 virus seems to be affecting large numbers of people your age			0
in order to keep it from spreading , some schools have temporarily shut down , while one @entity316 school district is planning to shut down drinking fountains			0
students are being urged to bring their own water to class			1
school officials are even propping doors open to try and keep the handles and the students germ free			1
word to the @entity326 @entity327 , @entity23 : a word to the @entity326 ... tuition ( noun ) a charge or fee for instruction , specifically at a private school , college or university source : www.dictionary.com college costs @entity34 : you know you have to pay tuition when you go to college			1
but universities get money from alumni and states as well			0
and when that money decreases , due to a recession , for example , the tuition you pay can increase			1
for a lot of people , what you can afford is a big part of determining where you 're gon na go			0
and right now , tuition costs are higher than ever			1
( begin video ) @entity34 : higher education is coming with a higher price tag			0
unlike housing in @entity42 , college is a serious seller 's market			1
@entity362 , @entity363 : both the cost and price of higher education have gone up faster than almost anything else in the @entity42 economy for 25 years			0
@entity34 : so , how much money are we talking ? according to a new survey by the @entity375 , if you 're planning to go to a public , four - year university in your own state , you 're looking at a 6.5 percent increase to around $ 7,000 dollars per year just for tuition and fees			1
public schools in another state : 6.2 percent increase , or more than $ 18,500 tuition			1
private schools : 4.4 percent increase , more than $ 26,000 per year , tuition			1
i keep saying " tuition " because room and board in each of these categories is also going up , making the yearly totals even more expensive			1
there is a silver lining , though			0
about two - thirds of full - time students are getting help in the form of financial aid			1
and that does n't have to be paid back			0
but what about the third that does n't get financial aid ? student loans often come into play here , and not surprisingly , borrowing went up five percent for the ' 08 - ' 09 academic year			0
( @entity197 ) before we go @entity34 : before we go today , we 're talking about video games			0
they 're not just for young people			0
this bowling tournament is strictly for seniors and it 's all about the @entity413			0
about 600 older rollers took to the virtual lanes at this tournament recently in @entity417			0
the goal of these gamers was n't just to set a world record -- which they did			0
the event was also designed to encourage seniors to stay fit in order to avoid injuries			0
goodbye @entity34 : plus , it looks like everyone had a @entity413 - ly good time			0
aw yeah , that 's how we roll			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity32 .			0
