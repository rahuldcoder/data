-- by now , most of us have probably heard that @entity3 and @entity4 paid just under $ 2 million in taxes on income -- virtually all from investments -- of just under $ 14 million for 2011 , an effective tax rate of 14.1 %			1
this is a low tax rate , lower than the typical middle - class @entity11 worker pays , especially when one considers payroll taxes , the largest burden for most @entity11			1
it should concern us that individuals of @entity18 's wealth -- analysis has put his personal fortune as high as $ 250 million , not counting some $ 100 million in trusts set up for his five children -- pay so little as a percent in taxes			2
it is also correct to note that there appears to be nothing wrong or illegal in the tax returns that @entity18 released			1
sure , there are still many unanswered questions , and speculation and innuendo will no doubt continue			0
but all of that is beside the point , or ought to be			0
it is what it is			0
the real attention should be on a tax system that allows the really rich to pay so little in percentage terms and on the best solution to making that tax system better and fairer			1
opinion : @entity46 risk being the party of mean the knee - jerk reaction is to raise tax rates , as in the so - called @entity51 : anyone earning more than $ 1 million should pay an effective rate of at least 30 %			1
if this rule were in place today , it would more than double the @entity58 ' income taxes			2
only , it would n't			0
the @entity51 would n't work , because really rich @entity11 do not have to show any " income " on their tax returns			1
the @entity58 paid tax because they hold stocks and securities yielding dividends and interest , and because they sold assets generating capital gains			2
they did n't have to do so			0
the simple strategy of the super-rich is to buy and hold , and to borrow when needed to finance their lifestyles			0
some basic facts : any tax consists of a base , or what is being taxed , times a rate			2
the income tax 's base is " income , " which comes from labor or wealth			1
income from labor is hard to hide and easy to tax , as the middle class knows full well			2
income from wealth is easy to hide and hard to tax -- and perfectly legally			2
a non-dividend - paying stock , like @entity51 's @entity89 ( or land , artwork , sports franchises ) , does not have to show any taxable income			2
people who own such things can be very rich and live very well			0
if we simply raised tax rates , the super-rich would just as simply stop showing income or selling assets			2
that 's why , under an income tax , we pretty much have to have low rates on investment			1
does this strike you as unfair ? if you 're like most @entity11 -- i.e. , if you 're middle class -- then your blood may be boiling at the fact that the super rich seem to be able to hold us all hostage to low tax rates under an income tax			1
the important question is -- how do we fix this ? the answer lies in switching the tax base before we raise the tax rates			0
tax spending , rather than work or savings			1
then , we could apply a 30 % or higher rate to spending at @entity18 's level			1
the real inequity shown by the @entity58 ' tax situation , after all , is measured by the taxes they pay as a percent of their spending or lifestyle			1
for most @entity11 , living paycheck to paycheck , spending ( after taxes ) pretty much equals income ( after taxes )			1
it 's a good guess that the @entity58 are spending a great deal more than the income they are showing on their tax returns			1
they should be , if they are well - advised ( and if they are not well - advised , we have other concerns )			0
what would @entity18 be spending money on ? how about running for president , for one thing			0
@entity18 spent $ 45 million of " his own " money running for president in 2008 ( less than the $ 60 million @entity148 allegedly spent in 1992 )			0
i suspect that @entity18 has spent more of his own money this time around , if only because he has gone further and been more successful in his quest			0
opinion : @entity154 , @entity18 and your pay here is another turn of the screw			0
running for president is legally considered a personal expense , nondeductible under the income tax			1
such expenses , however , are in essence deductible from another @entity11 tax , and the largest single one facing the @entity58 : the gift and estate tax			1
that so - called death tax applies to what is left over on one 's deathbed			0
the simplest way to avoid it is to spend all that you have and die broke			0
under current law , @entity18 's family would have to pay about $ 80 million in estate taxes after his and @entity4 's death			1
if @entity18 spent $ 45 million in 2008 , at that year 's estate tax rate , his family would have saved more than $ 20 million in taxes because of his presidential run ( no need to discount for present value , as the unspent wealth would have appreciated in value )			1
in sum , the government is pitching in , in the form of foregone estate tax revenue , for @entity18 's and other rich people 's presidential runs			2
it is ironic that the real problem with @entity18 's personal financial situation is his spending , not his work or savings , and that no one is paying attention to that			0
excessive spending at all levels is our national problem , and it is what soon might make us another @entity207			0
no one is paying much attention to that , either			0
meantime , we have a tax system set up to encourage spending and borrowing , especially by the rich			1
the only way to raise taxes under today 's income tax is to increase the burdens on working and saving -- just about the last things we should be doing			1
if we taxed spending , in contrast , the @entity58 and other really rich families would see their taxes increase in absolute and percent terms			2
yet we oppose consumption or spending taxes because we perceive them as regressive			0
it 's all nearly perfectly perverse , and not a peep on point			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			0

@entity3 and @entity4 paid an effective tax rate of 14.1 % in their 2011 returns
@entity239 : raising the tax rate wo n't affect the very rich
he says very rich @entity11 do not have to show any " income " on their tax returns
@entity233 : tax spending , rather than work , and the rich will have to pay more taxes
