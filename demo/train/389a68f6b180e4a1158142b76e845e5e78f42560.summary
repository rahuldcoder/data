-- a welcome spotlight is now being shone on the murky trade in @entity4 horsemeat , but the public are still being left in the dark about the brutal treatment and needless suffering of the horses destined for their plates			1
every year around 65,000 horses are crammed into trucks and transported across @entity4 to the slaughterhouse for what can be days on end in hellish conditions			1
@entity16 : what 's behind the horsemeat contamination scandal ? stressed , injured , exhausted , dehydrated and suffering from disease , these horses are desperate for food , water and rest			2
no type of horse is spared : including infirm working horses , foals ( foal steak commands a premium among those who eat horse meat ) and those bred and fattened to obesity to command the highest prices at slaughter			1
few , if any of them , are fit enough to travel on such long journeys -- a feat which would challenge even the most athletic sport horses			1
many thousands of @entity41 's horses are also transported vast distances on journeys to slaughter in @entity44 and @entity45 , so this is not simply a @entity4 problem			1
@entity49 health chief vows plan to restore confidence in wake of horsemeat scandal @entity53 undertakes regular field investigations as part of its campaign to stop these long - distance journeys , and for years we have documented the appalling suffering of these horses			1
in recent shipments we inspected , 89 % of the horses had an injury and 93 % showed clinical signs of disease			2
their misery was clear - all were showing signs of exhaustion and depression and many had suffered painful wounds from poorly designed compartments and terrible friction injuries due to inadequate space on the vehicle			0
no animal should have to suffer this			0
the @entity82 's own advisors , the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) have clearly stated that " journey duration should not exceed 12 hours for horses			2
" first @entity86 tests reveal scope of horsemeat contamination yet still the @entity82 refuses to change the legislation that allows horses to be transported indefinitely , so long as they are given rest every 24 hours ( a rule often broken , in part because it is unenforceable in practice )			1
horses ' immune systems decline after 10 hours of transportation making them more susceptible to disease			2
this is extremely unpleasant for the horses and it also poses a real risk to the equine industry of @entity4 , as horses intended for slaughter , often mix with other horses along the major routes			1
we regularly present the findings from our investigations to the @entity82 , and share information on breaches of transport law with the authorities			0
we have also presented a number of recommendations in our ' @entity117 ' of welfare problems caused by the trade and our proposed solutions			2
at the center of these recommendations is a 9 - 12 hour journey limit for horses ( in keeping with the view of the @entity82 's own scientific advisors ) , which is perfectly feasible given the abundance of slaughterhouses licenced to take horses , and would actually save money and red tape by harmonising with other laws			0
yet the @entity82 still refuses to act			0
so what we can do to help these horses ? first , we can make people aware of this appalling trade and encourage more @entity4 to speak out against it			1
we can also write to our own governments in @entity4 to call for change			1
and we can continue to press the @entity82 for the short , maximum journey limit that is recommended by the @entity82 's own scientific experts			0
this is not about stopping people eating horsemeat -- that is a personal choice -- it is about fulfilling our basic responsibility to care for horses during their lifetime			0
together the louder we can shout to be the horses ' voice , the more chance we 'll have to put an end to this needless suffering			0
and that 's exactly what it is -- utterly needless , reckless and brutal			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			0
