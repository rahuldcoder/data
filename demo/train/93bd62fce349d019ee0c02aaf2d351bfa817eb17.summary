-- he was the all - action @entity2 daredevil who was loved by all that knew him -- but @entity7 's premature death after an ambitious dive has hit the freediving community hard			1
" you do n't meet many people like @entity7 , " his close friend @entity10 told @entity0			1
" he was the best diver in the @entity2 -- the best			1
" he was one of a kind , " added @entity10			2
" i 'd known him for two years and judged him too -- and he was the best			2
" shock and sadness are the two overriding emotions which have surfaced since the man considered to be one of the best freedivers in the world lost his life while doing the thing he loved			1
the 32 - year - old @entity7 , who lived in @entity24 , @entity25 , had hoped to reach 72 meters ( 236 feet ) with one breath of oxygen without the assistance of fins			1
when he surfaced , he flashed the ok sign , before losing consciousness soon after , organizers said			1
@entity33 , who organized the nine - day tournament canceled the event following @entity7 's death			1
@entity7 was going for a record at @entity38 in the @entity39			1
at 202 meters ( 663 feet ) , it is considered the world 's deepest blue hole -- an underwater cave or sinkhole -- in seawater			2
freedivers are extreme athletes , descending more than 100 meters -- the equivalent of a 30 - storey building -- without using an oxygen tank			2
at that depth , the diver 's heart rate begins to slow , their blood vessels shrink and their lungs compress to the size of oranges under the huge force of water pressure			1
. the night before @entity7 died he sat and spoke with @entity10			1
for both men , free diving was an overriding passion and they spent countless hours together talking through their dives , their lives , what lay ahead and what lay below			0
" @entity7 was one of a kind			1
he was an incredibly passionate and driven man -- but he was also kind with it , " added @entity10			0
" he was very sensitive and deep but he had this pitbull - like tenacity about him			0
" we had lots of deep conversations			0
with diving a lot of it is about the mental aspect			0
" @entity7 , who was born in @entity78 , worked in the television industry while he pursuing his freediving hobby in his spare time			1
after making his first foray into competitions in 2012 , he claimed second place at the inaugural @entity85 in @entity86 , first place at the @entity89 tournament in @entity90 , and a silver medal in constant no fins at this year 's @entity93 in @entity94			0
in may , @entity7 became the first @entity2 man to dive down to 100 meters with a single breath -- an achievement which brought him a third national record			1
" when he did mess up then he 'd get really angry at himself and he was harsh on himself , " said @entity10			0
" he was a guy who was very much in the moment			0
he wore his heart on his sleeve in a balanced way			0
" he could feel very deeply but would always manage to put that to the side when diving			0
" photographer @entity108 worked with @entity7 at the @entity85 in @entity109 earlier this year			1
" he was just an all round good guy , " @entity110 told @entity0			0
" he was very altruistic			0
he cared about others a great deal and did a lot of volunteering and was much loved by everybody			0
" according to @entity10 , @entity7 's death is the first to occur in competition in 21 years			2
" we are very sad to report that earlier today @entity7 ( @entity2 ) tragically lost his life after a @entity124 dive to 72m , " said @entity118 , which organized the competition , in a statement on its website			1
" he was conscious when he surfaced but then blacked - out more than 30 seconds later			2
emergency procedures were followed and despite receiving immediate medical attention , he failed to regain consciousness			2
" at the moment we are all extremely shocked and saddened and trying to establish what happened			0
his family has been informed and all our thoughts and prayers are with them			0
" @entity135 freediving has an enviable safety record but the sport can never be risk - free , something understood by all freedivers			2
" we will give more details as soon as they emerge			0
" @entity118 , the competition organizers , paid its own tribute to @entity7			1
a statement on its website read : " at the end we honored his 32 years with a white - water celebration that echoed the celebrations of his many incredible dives			0
" watch what freediving looks like photos : pushing the limits of freediving			2
