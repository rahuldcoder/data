@entity0 , @entity1 -- the most foolish argument i 've heard from the never - ending efforts to discourage young @entity1 from cybercrime is that money is n't everything			1
well , lack is n't everything either			2
there 's also the equally common argument about integrity being worthier than wealth , as if a dichotomy must always exist between the two			2
no wonder the many 419 scammers -- for whom the specter of a destitute and unfulfilled future is a daily terror -- do n't appear ready to budge from their fraudulent ways			1
and so it was with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism that i attended an ' alternatives to @entity29 ' event organized by @entity30 and @entity31 ( pin )			1
what new doctrine did the anti-cybercrime brigade have to preach this time ? my 419 scams - themed novel had earned me an invitation to address the audience of university and secondary school students			1
another guest speaker was @entity41 , a young man who runs @entity42 , an organization that rehabilitates 419 scammers			1
the more he spoke , the more i found myself sitting straighter in my chair with rapt attention			2
no , he does n't warn the fraudsters against the ills of materialism or notify them that money does n't buy happiness			2
that grand sermon may wait until after they can afford three square meals a day			2
@entity41 's method is to teach the young men how to use the same skills developed from years of diligently scamming hard currency from gullible @entity58 , to make legitimate money online			2
@entity60 , the very first case @entity41 worked with , was a successful 419 scammer between 2004 and 2007			1
the 31 - year - old now makes an honest living from various online businesses			1
i went searching for him after the event			1
" i have been actively involved in network marketing for about three years and i daresay it is the shortest and fastest way to living the life of your dreams , " he told me			0
the former scammer also trades @entity75 in his spare time			0
@entity60 first contacted @entity41 in 2007 after coming across his blog which provided information on various online investment schemes			0
he was intrigued enough to contact @entity41 requesting a meeting			0
" when we met , i was shocked to see someone of my age range , " he said			1
" so it was easy for me to tell him my story and how i had been motivated by his write ups and how i was looking forward to change if he was going to help			0
" under @entity41 's tutelage , @entity60 eventually felt confident enough in his new line of work to completely abandon the old			0
both men then decided to reach out to other scammers			1
thus , @entity42 was born			1
@entity60 started by reaching out to the scammers he knew personally , his former colleagues			1
his experiences as a " former street boy " now making money through legitimate means enabled him to get through to some of the scammers , he said			1
today , @entity60 is @entity41 's partner and the " @entity100			0
" he heads the organization , and i play a support role , " @entity41 said , adding that his aim is to " push " @entity60 as a positive role model , since he 's " been there and done that			0
" @entity60 has also done some restitution , refunding his victims their swindled money			0
one of his former victims was shocked when he confessed that he had been scamming her all along			0
then @entity60 promised to refund her the approximately $ 25,000 he swindled from her			0
he eventually sent an initial $ 1000 , followed by several other installments			0
" she is now more of a family friend , as she is in touch with my family and friends till date , " he said			0
a brief survey of @entity1 's 419 communities appears to present three distinct categories of scammers			1
the first are the pioneers of the late 80s and early 90s , common criminals who simply saw yet another opportunity to make a dishonest living			0
the second , mostly university graduates from decent backgrounds , were chance criminals who found respite from unemployment and hopelessness , in scamming			1
it did n't help that they had watched the first category scam their way to respectability and philanthropy			0
the third group had simply observed the second , and saw them as role models			0
like their heroes , they also desired to ride fast cars , have assorted damsels perch on their arms and occupy prominent seats at public functions			0
despite being well provided for by his family , university graduate @entity60 says he fell into this third category of criminals after observing the lavish display of wealth and big cars driven by " small boys " in his area			1
" i got curious , asked questions , and the adventurous side of me took over , " he said			0
" i learned the game and got involved			0
it was fun and the easiest way to make real money			0
" @entity42 says it currently has about 10 rehabilitated scammers that have found legitimate opportunities to fend for themselves and their families , there are also around 40 who they describe as " work in progress			1
" but their vocation is certainly not a stroll in the park ; it takes patience to break into these networks and convince the scammers to opt for money - making opportunities that wo n't have them constantly looking over their shoulders			1
those who eventually sign up for " rehabilitation " are then followed up with seminars and training , where they are taught the basics of network marketing , entrepreneurship , e-books marketing and internet marketing till they actually start making money through the opportunities presented to them			0
unfortunately , a lean purse has forced @entity42 to go from monthly group meetings to more one - on - one sessions , which @entity60 says are not as effective as group meetings			1
most of the funding for the work they do comes from his and @entity41 's pockets and he believes proper funding would allow them to set up more centers around @entity1			1
but there is an increasing number of young people turning to email scams in the country			2
" you 'd be shocked to learn that we have youth as young as 15 in the cybercafes , sending scam mails to unknowing victims			2
some are in secondary schools , while some are not even educated , " @entity60 said			2
he believes a long - term solution is to provide these young people with alternative occupations			2
the world can continue to fight as hard as it will against 419 scams , but the 18 and 19 - year - olds who troop to @entity1 cybercafes everyday in search of that one ignoramus americanus or britanus -- whose hard currency will transform their lives -- have more severe worries to contend with than fear of the @entity239 or @entity240			1
and until these idle youngsters find a better alternative to the work which @entity245 has found for them , sadly , the world will know no rest from their torment .			0
