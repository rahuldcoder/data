it 's worth the struggle			2
sounding like a motivational speaker , president @entity4 asked young supporters on wednesday to encourage their peers to sign up for health coverage under his embattled reforms known both affectionately and derisively as @entity10			1
at a @entity11 , @entity4 used the opportunity to rally a key demographic for the success of the @entity15 now that the system 's problem - plagued website appeared to working smoothly for most users			1
@entity10 enrollment ramps up in days after website fix he compared the never - ending political fight over the health care reforms to struggles that surrounded social progress milestones of the past century			1
" i hope you have n't been discouraged by how hard it 's been because stuff that 's worth it is always hard , " @entity4 said			1
" the civil rights movement was hard			0
getting women the right to vote -- that was hard			0
making sure that workers had the right to organize -- that was hard			0
it 's never been easy for us to change how we do business in this country			0
" joking he had more gray hair because of relentless attacks on the reforms led by conservative republicans , @entity4 added it was worth it and told the laughing summit participants to " be persistent " in spreading information about new benefits and helping others enroll			1
" you may get a few gray hairs as a consequence , but at the end of the day , you 'll think it 's worth it , " he said			1
the botched october 1 launch of the @entity57 website for enrolling in new insurance exchanges set up under the reforms undermined the administration 's efforts to create early momentum for the new system			1
@entity11 begins three - week @entity10 blitz meanwhile , critics led by conservative republicans have tried to dismantle the health care law at every turn			1
with the website now functioning relatively smoothly , @entity4 launched a three - week blitz on tuesday to promote the reforms as uninsured consumers now required to obtain health coverage face a december 23 deadline to sign up in order to be covered as of january 1			1
a properly functioning @entity57 is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the health law that require people to have health coverage			0
in theory , the law would create large pools of younger , healthier participants whose premiums would help offset the cost of providing care for older policy holders who use the health care system more			1
the program depends on convincing younger people who might be less inclined to pay for coverage they do n't think they need			0
@entity4 told the youth summit participants to urge their friends and peers to " imagine what happens if you get sick ; what happens with the massive bills			2

administration officials hope the new ability of @entity57 to handle 800,000 users a day or more without major problems signals a major step forward in getting people to sign up			0
however , officials including @entity4 warn that glitches will persist and describe the website as a work in progress			1
" there will be other things that come up during the course of the next several months because you are starting off a new program that has an impact on one - sixth of the economy , " @entity4 said wednesday , adding that " we are just going to keep on working on it and improving it and refining it , and if we see a problem , we are going to fix it			2
but we are not repealing it			0
not as long as i am president			0
" insurance companies say some " back - end " aspects of the @entity57 system continue to malfunction			0
in particular , insurers cite problems with applications from people who signed up through the website , including erroneous or missing information			0
insurers still reporting errors on @entity10 applications @entity11 spokesman @entity144 said tuesday that tech experts were working on the processing problems , offering assurances they would be fixed in time for coverage on january 1			2
3 questions the administration wo n't answer about @entity10 @entity152 criticism continues republicans seeking to eliminate the health care reforms leap at any opening to attack the law that passed @entity157 without any @entity152 support			1
they accuse @entity4 and @entity159 of lying about the effects of the reforms , noting several million people had policies canceled despite pledges they could keep coverage they liked , and they describe the @entity10 as an example of big government run amok			1
on wednesday , the @entity169 demanded that the administration make public the problems cited by insurers with the 834 forms for applying for coverage on @entity57			0
" democrats are spending this week telling people how great they think @entity10 is , but they ca n't even get a website to function correctly , " said a statement by @entity169 chairman @entity176 , adding that " the entire law -- not just the website -- is riddled with errors and needs to be repealed and replaced			1
" meanwhile , the @entity169 's national youth director , @entity183 , called wednesday 's @entity11 event an attempt to distract young @entity186 from the problems of the reforms			2
" i 'd love to see the @entity11 use this time to answer some important questions from people , like ' why are premiums doubling ? ' and ' why ca n't i keep my doctor ? ' and ' why did you lie to us ? ' , " @entity183 said in a statement			0
@entity4 and @entity159 accuse republicans of seeking to eliminate benefits of the reforms -- such as guaranteeing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and ending caps on coverage costs -- without proposing anything substantive to help millions of uninsured @entity186 get affordable health insurance			1
he told the summit participants that they can play a significant role in helping people learn more about the reforms and signing up			0
" the truth is that for your friends , for your family , the most important source of information is not going to be me , it 's going to be you , " the president said			0
" they are going to trust you			0
" @entity4 ok with ' @entity10 ' label getting specific , @entity4 urged student body leaders to organize conferences and bartenders to organize happy hours " and also probably get health insurance because most bartenders do n't have it			1
" the president also cleared up any question about whether he had a problem with calling the reforms @entity10 , a label used pejoratively by @entity152 foes			1
repeating a line from his successful re-election campaign last year , @entity4 said to laughter and applause wednesday that " i know people call this law @entity10 and that 's ok because i do care , i do , " adding , " i care about you , i care about families , i care about @entity186			1
" @entity242 matters : obamacare or @entity10 ? a source familiar with the website said wednesday that 29,000 people had enrolled through it since officials announced sunday that they had fixed the most egregious problems plaguing @entity57 for the two previous months			2
the three - day figure is a vast improvement over october , the first month of the six - month enrollment period , when fewer than 27,000 people signed up through the @entity57 website that was supposed to be the main enrollment portal			0
overall , the total of enrollees in october topped 100,000 , including those who used alternate channels and successful exchanges set up by 14 states			0
@entity262 , the official charged with implementing @entity10 as director of the @entity264 , said at a congressional hearing last month that the administration initially hoped to enroll 800,000 people by the end of november			2
