@entity0 -- delegates from the @entity3 and other nations walked out of the @entity5 on thursday as @entity7 president @entity6 delivered a fiery speech that criticized @entity9 , capitalism and the world body itself			1
though incendiary statements from @entity6 are nothing new , tension in the hall grew as the @entity7 leader recounted various conspiracy theories about the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on @entity19 and @entity9			1
" some segments within the @entity3 government orchestrated the attack , " @entity6 told the @entity5			2
he followed with the claim that the attacks were aimed at reversing " the declining @entity3 economy and its scripts on the @entity27 in order to save the @entity30 regime			0
the majority of the @entity3 people , as well as most nations and politicians around the world , agree with this view			0
" that appeared to be the last straw for many of the diplomats			0
representatives from the @entity3 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 walked out while @entity6 asserted that @entity3 government was involved in the attacks or allowed them to happen as an excuse to go to war in @entity52 and @entity53			1
president @entity54 already had delivered his address to the @entity5 and had left the grounds before @entity6 spoke			1
@entity58 spokesman @entity57 said the president " found the comments to be outrageous and offensive , given how close we are to ground zero , " the @entity19 site of the attacks			1
and @entity66 , a spokesman for the @entity3 mission to the @entity0 , said in a statement , " rather than representing the aspirations and goodwill of the @entity7 people , mr. @entity6 has yet again chosen to spout vile conspiracy theories and anti-semitic slurs that are as abhorrent and delusional as they are predictable			1
" a @entity76 diplomat said that all 27 member nations had agreed to walk out if @entity6 made inflammatory statements during his address			0
the exits did not deter the @entity7 leader from his line of attack , however			0
@entity6 went on to compare the death toll in the september 11 attacks to the casualty count in the wars in @entity52 in @entity53			1
" it was said that some 3,000 people were killed on september 11th , for which we are all very saddened , " he said			0
" yet , up until now in @entity52 and @entity53 , hundreds of thousands of people have been killed , millions wounded and displaced , and the conflict is still going on and expanding			2
" @entity6 also continued the attack on capitalism that he began during a monday address at the @entity96			0
he linked the @entity3 - led conflicts in @entity53 and @entity52 with wars for colonial expansion in @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			1
the @entity7 president also touched on the recent controversy over a @entity107 pastor 's plans to burn copies of the @entity109 , the @entity110 holy book , by waving copies of a @entity112 and a @entity109 as he declared his respect and reverence for both			2
and he concluded his address with a defense of @entity7 's nuclear ambitions , discussing a recently submitted statement to the @entity0 's nuclear watchdog , the @entity121			2
@entity1 's @entity122 and @entity123 contributed to this report .			0
