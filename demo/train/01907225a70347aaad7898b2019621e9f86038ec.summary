@entity0 -- @entity6 was " totally addicted to propofol , " the surgical anesthetic the coroner ruled killed him , the pop star 's dermatologist said in an interview with the @entity10 network			1
dr. @entity11 said he personally tried several times to prevent other doctors from administering propofol to @entity6 for sleep			1
" i knew this problem existed , " @entity11 said in the interview saturday			0
" i did my best to prevent it			0
whenever i could , i prevented it , but i 'm only one man and i have to support my own life and take care of myself			0
" @entity11 disputed the argument by dr. @entity22 's lawyers that he addicted @entity6 to @entity23 in the months before his death , saying he used only low doses of the painkiller while repairing @entity6 's collapsed nose and jawline			1
because @entity23 was not found in @entity6 's blood , the judge did not allow dr. @entity22 's defense to call @entity11 as a witness in @entity22 's involuntary manslaughter trial , in which jurors are scheduled to resume deliberations monday morning			1
but medical records of @entity6 's visit to @entity11 's @entity40 clinic were introduced as evidence			1
@entity11 described three instances in which he said he was involved as interventions to prevent @entity6 from getting propofol , although @entity11 gave no indication of when the incidents occurred			1
in the first instance , @entity11 said he chartered a plane to @entity49 when he heard @entity6 was getting propofol at a hotel where the singer was staying			2
@entity11 claimed he threw out the doctor involved to prevent him from giving @entity6 the drug			2
in another encounter in @entity55 , @entity11 said he and his nurse slept on the floor of @entity6 's room to prevent him from getting propofol from a plastic surgeon			1
@entity11 claimed he once " saved " @entity6 in @entity60 when another doctor administered propofol , combined with another drug			2
it made @entity6 go " running down the street , " @entity11 said			0
a @entity66 jury is deliberating the fate of @entity22 , the physician caring for @entity6 when he died in june 2009			1
@entity11 , interviewed in his @entity40 home , said that while it was too upsetting to watch much of the trial , he watched enough to believe @entity22 wanted to " make me look like a demon " and " make me as a scapegoat			2
" @entity22 's defense contends @entity6 became addicted to @entity23 through frequent visits to @entity11 's @entity40 dermatology clinic in the months before his death			1
@entity22 was unaware of the addiction , and therefore unable to understand why he could not help @entity6 sleep , the defense contends			2
medical records presented to the jury showed at least 24 visits by @entity6 to @entity11 's office from march 12 until june 22 , 2009 , three days before @entity6 's death			1
the defense previously said @entity6 was given 6,500 milligrams of @entity23 at @entity11 's clinic during those visits			2
@entity6 received 900 milligrams of @entity23 at @entity11 's clinic over three days in early may , the records showed			2
" i would never give a person those doses they attributed to me , " @entity11 said			0
the records are misleading because he was in @entity93 during most of may , he said			0
other doctors working out of @entity11 's office may have given @entity6 that larger doses of @entity23 , he said			2
when asked if @entity22 's defense team knew they were not all @entity11 's medical records , @entity11 responded by saying , " they absolutely had to know			1
why do you think they covered the signature on the bottom of the chart ? " it was noted during testimony that no doctor 's signature was on the medical records			0
@entity22 's defense team , which is under an order from the judge not to talk to reporters about the case , did not immediately respond to @entity11 's comments			1
@entity11 said he began the slow and painful process of rebuilding some of @entity6 's facial skin in early april after his nose collapsed and after he lost his jaw line			1
@entity6 , who was preparing for his comeback concert tour , wanted to look his best , @entity11 said			0
" @entity6 was an absolute perfectionist , " he said			0
@entity11 said he is being attacked because he is different			0
he likened his plight to @entity123 and @entity6			0
he cited the molestation trial of @entity6 as an example of how the singer was targeted for being different			0
@entity11 said he was angry about @entity6 's death under @entity22 's care			1
" where did they find this man ? " he said			0
@entity6 recruited @entity22 to work as his personal physician after @entity22 had treated him and his children for minor illnesses while they were in @entity49 , according to testimony			1
@entity11 said he did not believe @entity6 would approve of the current trial of his doctor			0
" this is insanity , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity139 contributed to this report .			0
