transcript this is a @entity17			2
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity21 , @entity22 : one country prepares for its next orbiting opportunity while another has to wait to kick - start its space program			1
we 're launching into the details in @entity0			2
first up : @entity31 @entity32 : we begin in @entity34 , where a series of bombings have rocked the capital city of @entity31			2
the @entity8 pulled its combat troops out of @entity34 cities and towns back on june 30th			1
that left security responsibilities to the @entity34			2
but violence has been on the rise since then , and yesterday marked the deadliest day in the nation since the end of june			2
at least 95 people were killed and more than 560 others were wounded by six explosions across @entity31 , including two that targeted government buildings			2
authorities said that two people who were believed to be connected to the attacks were arrested yesterday			2
@entity34 's prime minister said the bombings will force the country to re-evaluate its security plans			2
but @entity8 officials said the attacks wo n't stop @entity34 from building a peaceful society and wo n't stop the @entity8 from helping with those efforts			1
@entity3 @entity63 @entity32 : @entity8 forces are also helping out in @entity3 today , as that country holds just the second presidential election in its history			1
security has been a big concern leading up to the event			2
several election workers were killed in attacks this week , and the @entity73 has vowed to disrupt the voting with violence			1
that 's why @entity8 @entity77 and @entity3 soldiers have been deployed to help protect voters			1
@entity3 's @entity80 estimates that there are about 17 million registered voters in the country			1
that 's about 4.6 million more than in 2004 during the last election			1
many of them live in remote areas			1
in order to get them voting supplies , officials are using helicopters , cars , even donkeys			2
@entity95 went along for the ride to one of these polling places and he tells us about the preparations leading up to today 's election			1
( begin video ) @entity103 , @entity0 correspondent : we 're in a convoy in a police truck			2
we 're escorting this truck up ahead of us -- in the dust , you might be able to see it -- and it 's taking ballot boxes up to some of the polling stations here in @entity3 's central @entity115 province			1
as you can see , security is important here , even though this is one of the safest provinces in the country			2
despite that good track record , election workers say , in some parts of the province , they 've heard of armed men going house to house , warning people not to vote			1
and also , there 's been a spike in violence and insurgent attacks over the past three months , as insurgents have tried to disrupt this election process			1
now , you can tell the roads here are not paved			2
despite the fact that @entity115 is one of the safest provinces in the country -- it 's been spared the daily car bombs and roadside bombs that the south and the east of the country have seen , and some of the assassination attacks -- it still has n't really benefited from reconstruction			2
there are fewer than five miles , five kilometers of paved road in this entire province			2
and that makes this election a real logistical challenge			1
you can see the posters over there of some of the candidates for provincial council and for president			0
people here , they say they are going to participate in the elections			0
and there is a lot of support here for the incumbent president , @entity167 , in part because some of the traditional ethnic @entity171 leaders , this is a predominantly ethnic @entity171 province , they have endorsed the incumbent president , @entity167			1
( @entity174 ) @entity175 ! @entity176 , @entity22 : see if you can i.d. me ! i became an independent country after @entity180 i 'm located on a peninsula in @entity182			0
my capital city of @entity184 hosted the @entity185			0
i 'm @entity9 , and i 'm home to around 48.5 million people			1
launch delayed @entity32 : @entity9 's space program is in a holding pattern after officials cancelled yesterday 's rocket launch just eight minutes before liftoff ! in fact , this is the seventh time that the launch has been postponed since the program was started in 2002			1
engineers say this week 's delay is due to a technical glitch , and it will take at least three days to figure out what went wrong and try again			0
@entity9 is hoping that the rocket , which cost about $ 400 million , will jump - start its space program			1
the ultimate goal is to send an unmanned probe to the moon by 2025			0
@entity207 @entity32 : the @entity8 space program has been running for decades , and @entity209 is planning its latest launch for next week			1
bad weather or technical concerns could cause delays , but if everything goes according to schedule , the space shuttle discovery will go up tuesday morning on its 37th mission into space			1
the seven - person crew will be delivering equipment and supplies to the international space station			1
@entity223 @entity227 : ... whose current crew - up there now - is enjoying this view ! what you 're looking at is @entity223 as seen from the orbiting space station			1
the first hurricane of the 2009 @entity234 season increased to a category 4 storm by wednesday afternoon			0
it 's big , it 's bad , it 's moving through the @entity234			0
but forecasters do n't expect it to affect the @entity241 , although they say it 's too early to tell if @entity243 will have an impact on the northeast			0
@entity246 @entity247 , @entity22 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity250 ' government classes at @entity251 in @entity252 , @entity253 ! on what stringed instrument would you find a tune - o - matic bridge , tremolo and pickups ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it a : a ) @entity263 or @entity264 ) @entity265 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! you can find all of these features on an electric guitar			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! guitar of the future @entity32 : electric guitars have been around for more than 70 years			1
they 've seen some changes during that time -- the type of strings , the shape of the instrument , even what it 's made out of -- but they 've all basically sounded the same			0
@entity284 tells us about a new guitar that incorporates the past as it moves toward the future			0
( @entity289 ) @entity290 , @entity0 reporter : the last couple of years , guitars have added mini-computers that add a whole new dimension			1
@entity294 , @entity295 : what this is attempting to do is kind of integrate digital and analog signals , and the worlds exist within them			0
@entity301 : at the @entity295 , @entity302 shows off the latest offering			0
it 's the @entity305 , which is based on the famous @entity307 classic guitar , but with a microprocessor inside , taking studio effects out on the road			0
@entity311 : with the advantage of digital audio and recording systems that are available in - house , to where everyone can do it themselves			0
this allows you to tap into those abilities and get all sorts of different sounds that were never possible with a regular guitar			0
@entity301 : the guitar tones itself , just by turning the master control knob , one can change to any of 18 different tones			0
with a small servo motor on each tuning key , it looks like magic			0
the guitar also has a technology called " chameleon " that can simulate several classical sounds , sounds that use to depend on the different types of wood a guitar is made from , like a classic electric guitar or an acoustic guitar to a more jazzy sound			1
@entity311 : guitar players are generally kind of looking to the past for what they 've always liked sound wise			0
and what this does is lets you get all those classic sounds from the past , staples of rock music , jazz music and all that from one guitar			1
@entity301 : the guitar can also be connected to a nearby computer that gives more choices : the type of amplifier you use , the equalization , effects and even record a " loop " and play on top of it , all live			0
for some guitarists , this is the evolution of sound : endless turning possibilities , cutting edge technology and the ability to produce different sounds with just one click			1
one has to realize that creativity has a very interesting new tool			0
@entity284 , @entity0 , @entity377			0
( @entity378 ) promo @entity32 : showoff			0
but i guess if i were that good , i 'd be showing off too			0
now you tell us : is this cool , with technology making something better ? or is it cheating , kind of taking something away from tuning the guitar yourself ? we thought you musicians might have something to say about this			1
say it on our blog ! @entity391 to @entity392 and riff your opinion			0
before we go @entity32 : before we go , want to know the fastest way to ruin a quiet summer evening ? have this guy show up on your front porch ! yeah , that 's all the same snake			0
11 feet long , 55 pounds and does n't seem to like being held			0
the pesky python slithered up on a @entity403 family 's front stoop this week before getting stuck in a nearby fence			0
when animal control showed up , it took two officers to wrestle the rascally reptile into the truck			0
goodbye @entity32 : they should have just called in @entity410			0
if you do n't get that joke , just watch yesterday 's before we go segment			0
but we are going to slither away for today			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity30 .			0
