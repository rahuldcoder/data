@entity0 -- in the tight circle that surrounds president @entity5 , @entity3 spokesman @entity2 is in the inner bubble			1
he 's the 3 a.m. wake - up call when @entity8 fires a test missile , or when the @entity11 committee picks the president for the top award			1
" trust me , it is a job i would gladly give to anybody who would volunteer , " @entity2 said			2
or would he ? after all , he 's an adviser , a friend and a mouthpiece for the administration with more access than recent press secretaries			1
" i can walk in and ask him a question at any given time , pick up the phone and talk to him about anything at any given time			1
i think [ that ] makes my job easier , " @entity2 said in an exclusive interview with @entity1			2
the president and the press secretary first connected in 2004 when @entity5 was a virtual unknown outside of @entity33 , @entity34 , and was campaigning for the @entity35			1
they clicked and grew close , leading @entity5 to tell the @entity37 in a 2008 interview , " @entity2 is the guy i want in the foxhole with me during incoming fire			1
if i 'm wrong , he challenges me			0
he 's not intimidated by me			0
" @entity2 chuckled while recalling the comment and quipped , " that is when we called him ' senator ' or by his first name			2
" while challenging @entity5 when he was on a campaign bus is much different than pushing back in the @entity48 , @entity2 insists that @entity5 still seeks opposing opinions and dislikes an atmosphere where everyone tells him he 's right			1
ten months into his job in the @entity3 , @entity2 , who grew up in @entity54 , @entity55 , says he 's finally starting to get more comfortable , even though he admits that the 24/7 pace " is certainly a challenge			1
it can wear you down			0
" especially when it comes to the daily main event			0
@entity2 briefs the @entity3 press corps , usually for about 45 minutes			1
he rarely shows up on time , but he 's always ready to spar			2
the mouthpiece for the president often uses humor or sarcasm to deflect a tough question			1
in one exchange about the tit for tat over cable chatter and radio talk show host @entity72 , @entity2 uttered , " i 'll plead guilty to counterproductivity			0
" in another about managing the message , @entity2 said , " is there any evidence currently going on that i 'm controlling the press ? poorly , i might add ! " is this an effective strategy to handle the media ? " you tell me , " @entity2 said			2
" look , there 's no doubt that using a little humor to get out of a series of bad questions is n't an altogether bad technique			2
" watch @entity87 talk about his job especially since he 's involved in a daily high - wire act , as he calls it			0
the cameras are always rolling			0
a bad day for the @entity3 spokesman usually means a bad day for the administration			1
" my father likes reminding me he always thought my mouth would get me into sizable trouble , which it can on any given day , " @entity2 said			0
before starting his job , @entity2 studied former press secretaries and sought out their advice			0
he still relies on their guidance " fairly frequently , " he said			0
for example , @entity2 revealed that just last week he reached out to former @entity106 spokesman @entity105 to get " feedback on a question that was sort of nagging me a little bit			1
" when probed on what that question was , @entity2 replied , " i 'm not going to get into that , but good try			2
" even with the major policy issues the @entity3 is juggling , from @entity115 to health care to the economy , @entity2 says he 's still having fun			1
" if you did n't enjoy the job that i have , it would be the worst job in all of @entity0 , " he said			0
what he does n't like , he said , is the fact that he 's now a celebrity			0

it 's awkward , " he said .			0
