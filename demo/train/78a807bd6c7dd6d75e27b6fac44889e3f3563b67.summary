2014 is shaping up to be a pivotal political year for @entity0			1
voters in a handful of @entity0 primaries will have to decide if @entity4 will move toward responsible partisanship , or if the @entity6 slides further into polarization , shutdowns , manufactured crises and other forms of dysfunction			1
the battle has already begun			0
@entity13 , the political wizard behind @entity15 's campaigns , is engaging his @entity16 to take down any primary challengers to the @entity0 establishment 's candidates			1
he 's formed a group called the @entity21 to screen and recruit candidates the establishment likes for @entity25 and @entity26 seats			0
although @entity13 unsuccessfully spent hundreds of millions of dollars on former @entity31 gov. @entity30 and other federal candidates in 2012 , the @entity28 chamber of @entity29 joined efforts with @entity13 recently to elect candidates who favor big business and to defeat tea party , evangelical and libertarian candidates			1
" our object is to avoid having stupid candidates who ca n't win general elections , " @entity13 said on @entity38			0
@entity42 , a longtime @entity0 strategist and spokesman for the @entity28 @entity44 , told @entity45 , " our no. 1 focus is to make sure ... that we have no loser candidates			2
that will be our mantra : no fools on our ticket			0
" the @entity44 plans to spend at least $ 50 million in 2014 @entity0 primaries			1
that 's not much by current standards , but it 's provoked a reaction			0
" it 's insane , " @entity57 , @entity4 attorney and conservative activist told @entity59			0
" that 's fine if they want to spend that money , but i think it 's going to be wasted			0
" the @entity65 , a big player in right - wing politics , is n't happy with @entity13 's declaration of intraparty warfare			0
the club 's president , @entity70 , called the @entity13 - @entity28 chamber alliance " misguided in many respects			0
" after affirming their right to free speech , @entity70 added , " the problem with a lot of the groups is that they do n't really care about what the candidates believe			0
" in other words , the @entity13 groups find big - business , big - government candidates acceptable as long as they 're @entity0			2
it 's a little surreal to hear @entity13 and @entity42 insulting the tea party , while " credentialed conservatives " respond in polite and measured tones , but that 's where we are			1
@entity13 , a master at holding and stating diametrically opposed positions at the same time , predicted @entity0 unity while declaring victory in the battle to win over @entity0 voters who comprise the base of the party			2
" every @entity0 senator and virtually every representative challenged in a primary as insufficiently conservative will win , " he wrote -- an in - your - face prediction aimed at the @entity65 , tea party @entity0 and anyone dissatisfied with @entity13 's " winning for big business " strategy			1
in reaction , the @entity65 started a website that urges voters to " primary " their congressperson ; that is , run candidates against @entity4 @entity0 officeholders			2
however we slice it , ultraconservative , small - business , small - government @entity0 are opposing establishment @entity0 who are big - business , big - government conservatives			2
( there are only a handful of true @entity0 moderates left in @entity29 )			0
to put this in perspective , let me recount a little recent history			0
after the 2008 election , the @entity0 was so unpopular that in response , @entity13 and others decided to capitalize on the nascent tea party movement , using the @entity0 's structure , connections and money to propel it into a viable political force			1
@entity13 , in a 2010 column , advised independents who identified with the tea party movement to remain apart from the @entity0 and to " begin the difficult task of disassociating themselves from cranks and conspiracy nuts			1
" @entity13 's intent -- and that of the @entity0 establishment -- was to manipulate the tea party movement into kicking out @entity0 ultraconservatives			1
independents stayed where they were , in the middle , unassociated with either party or the tea party movement			1
however , tea party organizers ( almost all of them @entity0 ) captured a sizable portion of the @entity0 base , appealing better than the establishment to libertarians and evangelicals			1
this is why the @entity0 now finds itself in a civil war			2
@entity160 identifiers , libertarians and evangelicals keep separate identities , but they pretty well agree they do n't like the establishment , which includes @entity164 , @entity165 and anyone who associates too closely with them			0
for decades , the @entity0 establishment ran candidates in primaries who " talked the talk " of ultraconservatives but switched to more moderate talk for the general election , and after election , voted less conservatively			1
as gerrymandering isolated congressional districts into almost pure @entity0 or @entity180 constituencies , both parties began to nominate fewer and fewer centrist candidates			2
now , groups such as the @entity65 , the @entity183 and the @entity184 , among others , want to toss out big - business conservatives because time and practice have proved them untrustworthy to deliver on primary promises			0
the irony of this internal warfare is that @entity0 establishment leaders are the ones who have schooled the tea party republicans in the tactics of extreme partisan gridlock to achieve maximum political gain			1
now , the establishment is running against the tea party as if they were the political extremists			1
get ready for a showdown			0
join us on @entity205 / @entity204 .			0
