-- ok , there 's no way to write this article without name dropping			1
to cut to the chase , i know @entity7 and @entity8 , and you do n't			1
i used to work for " @entity10 " and " @entity11 " as the audience warm - up act			0
not a bad day job			0
but knowing the hosts did n't mean i got to parade on stage at saturday 's " @entity18			1
" i was in the audience with the thousands of fans , reporting on the events for @entity0			1
but the audience was where the real spectacle unfolded this weekend			0
@entity7 , @entity8 preside over rally in a lot of ways , the people congregating on the @entity26 looked just like the people i used to perform for back at " @entity10 " and " @entity11			1
" black , white , @entity34 , old , young -- every race , every ethnicity and every age group was represented in the sea of fans			0
the unifying characteristic , however , was that they were overwhelmingly thoughtful and hilarious @entity39			0
they appreciate good comedy and political satire			2
and they know how to create it themselves			0
that was made was obvious in the signs they carried			2
" @entity49 hates @entity50 , " " @entity51 was a total @entity52 " and the mundane but humorous " this is not a protest sign			1
" and like all good comedy shows , everyone sported a smile			2
in the days to come , there will be some commentators questioning whether @entity7 and @entity8 crossed the line from comedians to political commentators			1
in all honesty , i 'd say , yeah , i think they did make a political stance at the rally			2
the fact is comedy is an art form			0
people at rally : no tea please you ca n't be passionate about something and not have some part of yourself and your beliefs shine through			1
the message @entity7 and @entity8 were peddling came through loud and clear			1
as @entity7 said : " we live now in hard times			1
' " whatever your politics , i think everyone can agree that taking a step back and approaching our nation 's problems rationally and sanely is the only way solve them			2
and we have to do it together			0
as difficult as that might sound , we have to learn more about the issues we all care so passionately about			0
and then we have to have a civil conversation			0
without fear , and without insanity .			0

@entity0 's @entity103 once worked with @entity7 and @entity8
@entity103 was n't *talking* to his pals ; he was out saturday *observing* folks attending rally
@entity103 finds that a good sense of humor is what *attendees* had in common
funny signs he *spotted* : " @entity49 hates @entity50 , " " @entity51 was a total @entity52 "
