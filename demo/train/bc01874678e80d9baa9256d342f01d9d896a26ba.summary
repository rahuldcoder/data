-- @entity1 is facing its toughest test to date			1
the ebola virus , very deadly and currently without a cure , is fast - spreading throughout the small @entity6 country			0
@entity7 has overburdened @entity1 's already fragile health systems , and shown firsthand the devastating effect underdevelopment and lack of investment can have on a country 's well - being			1
decades of poor political decision making , bad investments and brain drain have rendered @entity1 incapable of managing a health crisis of this magnitude			1
in a desperate cry for international help , the government of @entity1 declared a state of emergency , informing the world that it has lost control in its battle against the virus			1
today , there are a handful of qualified doctors and nurses left to manage this health emergency			0
many health practitioners have left for better working conditions and higher wages elsewhere in the world			0
many of those that have remained have contracted the virus			0
their reward for their bravery is treatment in @entity1 's substandard facilities			1
while we are dealing with a worldwide epidemic , it is those living inside the country who are feeling the brunt of their government 's mismanagement			2
the number of those infected has doubled in recent weeks , forcing for the government to call a four - day lockdown starting this week in a bid to control the virus			0
what this means is that every @entity1 is quarantined inside their homes , unable to leave until after the lockdown			1
it is a method that some critics argue only drives those infected underground , and will do little to actually curb the spread			0
everyday life in the country is a challenge at the best of times , with many @entity1 living on the margins of society , and 60 % of whom already live below the poverty line			1
now , cut off from the rest of the world and facing a health crisis of unparalleled proportions , those same countrymen are likely to be pushed over the edge			0
those living in @entity81 , the nation 's capital , have to resign themselves to treatment in substandard health facilities , while watching infected @entity86 and @entity88 citizens be treated to a higher , more efficient level of medical care in their home countries			2
the @entity7 epidemic will certainly leave scars across the country			1
@entity1 's economy is expected to shrink by 3.5 % as a direct result			1
if @entity1 can ever hope to recover from this slump and get back on fiscal track , it will need a healthy working population and increased business confidence			2
right now , that 's going to prove a challenge			2
the @entity88 government has recently offered a glimmer of hope on that front , announcing it will build a 62 - bed , first - class medical facility in @entity81			0
should the building come to pass , it would bring some much - needed confidence to an already strained health sector			0
but more than anything , what @entity1 needs right now is for its government to show leadership at this critical point in the crisis			2
there needs to be a unified process for identifying and isolating suspected cases , and a centralized health system that can shoulder the weight of those already infected			0
because until the virus is brought under control , there will be a continual slowdown in all sectors of @entity1 's economy , a slowdown from which it might never recover			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			0
