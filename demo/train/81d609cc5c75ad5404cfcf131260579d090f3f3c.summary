@entity0 , @entity1 -- the memories are still raw for 78 - year - old @entity4			1
in her own home , guards put her through the daily humiliation of body searches			2
this is where guards repeatedly beat her youngest son , prominent blind human rights advocate @entity14 , and his wife			1
@entity4 's eyes well with tears when she described how officials refused to let her say goodbye to a different dying son			0
for more than 18 months , @entity4 was largely confined to house arrest along with her son			0
unlike @entity14 , she was still allowed to go out to buy groceries from time - to - time , accompanied by several guards			1
" the guards moved in , eating here , sleeping there -- and two usually sat right outside @entity14 's bedroom day and night , " said @entity4 , pointing to different areas in her courtyard			1
her chronic arthritis worsened during her son 's captivity			0
the dozens of burly plainclothes guards who blocked all entrances to this small village , turning away -- often violently -- would - be visitors including @entity2 crews on three different occasions , are now gone			2
they have left the farmer 's house tucked away in the rural @entity47 province			0
all that remains are the clucking chickens roaming free in @entity4 's courtyard			0
the lone reminder of that period seems to be a surveillance camera watching over a footpath where @entity14 's arguably most famous supporter -- " @entity56 " star @entity55 -- was roughed up and chased out last december			1
her youngest son , the blind activist , is now thousands of miles away in @entity59			0
his arrival in the @entity61 on may 19 -- along with his wife and children -- brought an end to a diplomatic firestorm between @entity66 and @entity67 that erupted after he fled from house arrest in late april and hid inside the @entity61 embassy in @entity1 's capital for a week			1
" they spent millions of dollars to keep me away from public view , but i still end up talking to you today , " @entity14 , who turned 41 on monday , told @entity2 via @entity72			2
" they should realize the effect of suppression and persecution wo n't last			0
" in 2006 , the self - taught legal activist was sentenced to four years and three months in prison for " damaging property and organizing a mob to disturb traffic			0
" his supporters have maintained that the charges were trumped up by local officials -- the same group that @entity14 said was responsible for the grotesque abuses he and his family suffered after his release -- to punish his legal advocacy			2
@entity14 has fought for victims of what he called abusive practices of the country 's draconian family planning policy , including forced abortions and sterilizations			1
like him , a new breed of grassroots activists for a myriad of causes -- united by their goal for a freer and more just society -- is making its mark in @entity1 , posing a rising threat to the @entity109 government obsessed with control and stability			1
@entity112 is an old friend of @entity14 and among the first people he met after fleeing to @entity66			1
a champion of democracy and political freedom , @entity114 , 39 , was arrested and sentenced to three and a half years in prison on subversion charges before the @entity119 in 2008			0
now technically a free man , @entity114 says his continued effort in exposing corruption and injustice after release from prison has led to constant harassment from the authorities , including frequent house arrest in his apartment complex in eastern @entity66 -- ironically named @entity130			0
" they try to destroy your dignity , your freedom , everything except your life -- and i think the root of such tyranny actually reveals their own insecurity , " @entity114 told @entity2 in a recent interview , before officials forced him to leave town to ensure a trouble - free 18th @entity135 @entity134 where a once - in - a - decade leadership transition will take place at its conclusion			1
" i 've always told the authorities , we 're playing the game of cat and mouse -- but i am the cat , " he added			1
inspired by the likes of @entity114 and @entity14 , analysts see a trend of more people in the younger generation -- armed with legal knowledge and internet skills -- joining the ranks of human rights activists at a time when mass discontent over problems like a widening income gap and rampant official corruption simmer beneath the surface			1
former @entity170 teacher @entity169 -- known by her online name @entity173 -- was so touched by @entity14 's story that she became involved in the plan to rescue him from his village to @entity66			1
police in her hometown of @entity181 detained her for a week after @entity14 's escape in april , but she says she feels no regrets			1
" as we become more educated and better off , i think our political conscience will become stronger , as more people wake up to stand up for their rights , " she said , adding that police had warned her not to go to @entity66 during the @entity185			0
as the @entity191 relies more on @entity1 economically during a global slump , observers say the issue of human rights has taken a backseat in its interaction with the @entity1 leadership , noting that it was barely mentioned during the recent @entity61 presidential election campaign			2
" this is compensated greatly by the fact that @entity66 is more worried than ever about the domestic human rights movement , about the fact that its citizenry is increasingly framing their demands through legal rights and human rights language , " said @entity199 , a @entity201 - based senior @entity200 researcher for @entity202			0
" @entity212 sees the stakes as getting higher and higher , and therefore we are seeing an increase in unlawful tactics and means of suppression of dissent			0
" @entity14 and his family say they have borne the brunt of such tactics , and relatives left behind continue to face official retribution after the activist 's escape			2
his oldest brother , @entity227 , has n't seen his son for half a year			0
authorities arrested the younger chen for attempted murder in late april and told his family that no one except police officers was allowed to see him during the investigation			0
the @entity236 have maintained that the activist 's nephew injured a few officials with a kitchen knife in self - defense when they broke into his house in the middle of the night and attacked his family after his uncle ran away			2
an official with the local police department , who declined to give his name , told @entity2 that the younger @entity14 's case is now " in the judicial process " and would not comment further			1
repeated phone calls to the local prosecutor 's office went unanswered			0
" my family is ruined , but i do n't regret helping @entity14 -- and we have done nothing illegal , " @entity227 said			0
" he helped those in need with his knowledge and skill -- and at least we can answer to our conscience			0
" with vice president @entity260 expected to be appointed the new @entity135 chief thursday , @entity173 says she feels more optimistic about the country 's future direction while @entity114 emphasizes he has lost all hope on the current regime			2
@entity14 , citing @entity1 history , views the leadership change as almost irrelevant when it comes to the inevitable fall of tyranny and move toward a constitutional democracy			1
while activists seem divided on whether a new generation of leaders will improve @entity1 's human rights record , @entity14 's elderly mother says she has a more basic worry : will her youngest son ever be allowed back home to live freely and safely ?			1

@entity14 's mother lives with memories of guards in their home
*dissident* @entity112 says @entity1 authorities are playing cat - and - mouse games
new breed of activists make mark in @entity1 , posing threat to the @entity135
