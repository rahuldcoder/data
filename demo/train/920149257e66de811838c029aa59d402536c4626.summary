remember " peak oil " ? five years ago , some oil market speculators became convinced that the world was nearing the limits of oil production			1
sometime soon -- the 2010s ? the 2020s ? -- oil production would begin a long steady decline			1
@entity8 oil production continues to rise			1
leading the oil renaissance : the @entity10			1
the @entity11 predicts that the @entity10 will overtake @entity12 and @entity13 to become ( again ! ) the world 's leading oil producer by 2017			1
if the agency 's estimates prove correct , the @entity10 and @entity16 together will become net energy exporters by about 2030 , and the @entity10 , which uses 20 % of the world 's energy , will achieve energy self - sufficiency by the mid- 2030s			1
predictions that the world would imminently " run out of oil " have been worrying oil consumers since at least the 1920s			2
they always prove wrong , for reasons explained by the great oil economist @entity29 after the last " oil shortage " in the 1970s : oil reserves , @entity29 writes , " are no gift of nature			2
they ( are ) a growth of knowledge , paid for by heavy investment			0
" for all practical purposes , the world 's supply of oil is not finite			2
it is more like a supermarket 's supply of canned tomatoes			0
at any given moment , there may be a dozen cases in the store , but that inventory is constantly being replenished with the money the customers pay for the cans they remove , and the more tomatoes that customers buy , the bigger an inventory the store will carry			0
someday , of course , consumers will decide they want less oil at the current price			0
someday we may move beyond oil altogether			0
when that day comes , the investment will stop -- and nobody will ever know or care how much oil remains in the ground			0
@entity29 's assessment is being corroborated once more , this time in @entity69			2
@entity69 oil production has been declining over the past decade , mostly because of under - investment and mismanagement by the state oil monopoly , @entity74			1
( on january 31 , a deadly tragedy reminded the world of @entity74 's troubles when a methane leak in a @entity74 building in downtown @entity80 exploded , killing more than 30 people and injuring 120 others			0
) in october , @entity74 announced discovery of a big new field in the @entity85			0
newly elected @entity69 president @entity86 is urging his country to amend its constitution to allow foreign investment in @entity69 oil fields			1
experts assess that opening the @entity69 oil industry to global investment will revive @entity69 oil production and boost @entity69 's economic growth by potentially 2 points a year			1
@entity86 's @entity97 party -- the very party that nationalized @entity69 oil 80 years ago -- is expected to vote this weekend to approve the new policy			1
meanwhile , the @entity11 is warning oil markets to ready themselves for a " flood " of cheap oil from @entity104			1
last year , @entity104 for the first time exceeded pre- 1990 oil production			1
the agency expects @entity104 eventually to overtake @entity13 as the world 's second - largest oil exporter			1
in 1972 , the year of the famous " @entity113 " report by the @entity112 , the world produced about 55 million barrels of oil per day			0
in 2011 , the world produced almost 80 million barrels			0
if today 's prices hold , many experts expect production of 90 million barrels by decade 's end			0
our oil problem is not that " we 're running out			0
" our oil problem is that we 're producing so much of the stuff that we are changing the planet 's climate			2
yet on the environmental front too , there 's reason for optimism			0
one of the technologies developed by the oil industry -- fracking -- has made available vast new supplies of cheap natural gas			1
gas has become so cheap that it can be substituted for coal as an electricity - generating fuel			0
in just eight years , coal 's share of the @entity10 electricity market has tumbled from one - half to one third -- and still falling			1
gas emits only half the carbon per unit of energy of coal			2
the transition from coal to gas explains why @entity10 carbon emissions declined 8 % from 2011 to 2012 , reaching the lowest level since 1992			1
soon the @entity10 and @entity16 will be producing so much gas that they can export it to @entity152 , perhaps also to @entity153 , helping to cut carbon emissions in those economies as well			1
no , it 's not the answer to everything : gas still emits carbon			2
but it 's an improvement -- and that 's how progress comes			0
instead of fantasizing about catastrophes ( running out of oil ) and miracles ( a rapid transition to solar power ) , our energy thinking needs to emphasize the achievable and the incremental			2
convert from coal to gas			0
tax gasoline to induce people to live closer to work and to buy more fuel - efficient cars			0
we can enjoy a rising quality of life with declining energy inputs			0
put us on the path to the right kind of " peak oil " -- and peak carbon -- the peak that comes , not because we find less and less , but because we want less and less .			2

five years ago , speculators predicted that oil production was peaking
@entity189 says recent evidence is that energy *sources* are *plentiful*
@entity104 and @entity69 can produce much more oil , and @entity10 is *awash* in natural gas , he says
@entity197 : gas *surplus* is enabling @entity10 to reduce carbon emissions that change climate
