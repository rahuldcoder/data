-- you could say @entity2 has always been something of an overachiever			2
by the age of 16 he 'd already won three science competitions for adults			0
now in his late 20s , the @entity8 is still dreaming big : he hopes to build and launch the first @entity10 manned shuttle into space			1
" it is n't about money , it is n't about competition or pride , " said @entity2 , founder of the @entity12			1
" the mission is about advancement in space technology as a continent and what we can contribute towards that growth			1
" while the group 's plans are ambitious , they are starting at the beginning of the aerospace ladder			1
to test their engineering skills , @entity2 and his team are finishing off the first @entity8 designed and built aircraft			1
but for @entity2 the sky is not the limit			0
" we are trying to have @entity10 participate in the contribution of knowledge into mankind 's destiny , " he said			0
he says the program 's slogan , " slowly we @entity43 and quickly we get @entity44 , " sums up why his efforts are so important			0
" united as one , the knowledge we acquire today will help generations of tomorrow , and perhaps save our future generations from some kind of catastrophe , " he continued			0
@entity2 has a team of over 600 volunteers , many of whom are engineering students , who work on the project in his backyard			1
@entity8 does n't have a history of space exploration and @entity2 is teaching the aspiring astronauts himself			1
" this is not a one - man mission			1
we work jointly to achieve goals , " @entity2 said			0
" i have trained my crew ( in ) advanced astronomy			0
they are very good at astronomy in regards to calculations and identifications of various space objects			1
" as well as his astronomy lessons , he 's educating them about the dangers of space , such as re-entry and the harms of radiation			2
but while the team may be knowledgeable , they lack the tools and machinery to properly get the project off the ground			2
it 's all down to money , but this could be about to change			0
the @entity8 @entity91 's @entity90 department has told @entity0 that the state is going to start providing financial support to the program			1
" you can call it a public - private partnership but mainly driven by the young people whose passion is in space science			1
i applaud their ambition , " said @entity101 , a spokesman from the department			0
" it provides an opportunity for @entity10 in general and @entity8 in particular to participate in space science and research instead of being spectators , " he continued			1
a team of flight engineers from the @entity8 @entity112 has also been assigned to review and advise the team			1
tushemereirwe would n't disclose how much funding the group will receive			1
but until now the project has been funded by well - wishers from around the world			2
@entity2 says equipment has been donated to them and anything else the team needs they make it themselves			2
" recently we manufactured and launched a prototype thruster , a small shuttle engine in a prototype format , " @entity2 said			2
one of the donors to the program is @entity130 , a financial analyst from @entity131			0
@entity132 discovered the group online and immediately wanted to be involved			2
" when you listen to the news you never hear good news from @entity10 , it 's always sadness , so this is a light , " she said			0
" they are trying to do something on a positive side rather a negative side compared to what i 'm used to hearing			0
" @entity132 is now trying to raise the group 's profile in the @entity149			2
" i want people to trust them and get involved so they can be part of history , " she said			0
despite the challenges the team faces , @entity154 remains confident they 'll have a space shuttle built in four to six years			1
he 's already named it " the @entity159			0
" " it will first operate in @entity163 's lower orbit then advance with time , " he said			0
" we might not have money in our system but we do get our homework done ! "			0

the @entity12 is based in @entity8
a team of over 600 volunteers are building an aircraft and space shuttle
the group has just *secured* funding from the @entity8 *government*
the founder says they 'll have a shuttle built in 4 - 6 years
