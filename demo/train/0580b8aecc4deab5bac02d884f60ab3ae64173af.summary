editor 's note : @entity2 , a junior at @entity4 majoring in government , is an editorial editor at the @entity6 as well as a senior editor and columnist for the @entity4 - @entity10 journal on @entity11 and society , @entity13			2
she is chairwoman of the @entity15 on @entity16			0
@entity17 says president @entity19 's early words and actions send a powerful , positive signal to @entity22			1
@entity23 , @entity24 ( @entity25 ) -- president @entity19 has given the @entity22 community around the world the message we have been waiting for			1
he reassured @entity22 in @entity30 that " we are a nation of @entity32 and @entity22 , @entity33 and @entity34 -- and nonbelievers			0
" for those like me who were critical of his standoffish attitude toward @entity11 during his campaign , this signaled a welcome change			0
even more important was his subsequent statement : " to the @entity22 world , we seek a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect			1
" in traveling throughout @entity48 in the past two years , i heard several @entity50 comments ; these @entity51 were challenging me , a muslim , about @entity30 foreign policy in @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
in @entity22 countries , i 've heard admiring comments about how great it must be to live in a rich country like @entity30 , followed by accusations that , " your president @entity62 does n't like us @entity22			2
" as a @entity64 , i have found myself in a difficult position			0
in @entity30 , i 've had to explain @entity11 to other @entity30 , and abroad , i 've had to explain @entity30 to those in the @entity22 world			1
@entity19 has done all @entity30 a favor by extending a hand of friendship to the @entity22 world			1
for me personally , it has alleviated the pain of witnessing the country i love engage in a foreign policy that i could not approve of as a @entity22 and as an @entity30 -- a foreign policy that created mutual distrust between @entity30 and @entity22			0
and @entity19 has followed up on his statements with actions			2
in his first steps as president , @entity19 has initiated the closure of the @entity81 , called for the withdrawal of @entity30 troops in @entity55 and appointed former senate majority leader @entity84 , well - respected for his role in the @entity87 peace process , as special envoy for the @entity89			0
for the past few weeks , i 've heard overwhelming praise from @entity22 for @entity19 's recent actions			1
@entity19 has recognized a key fact that former president @entity62 did not : muslims in @entity30 and elsewhere are strongly affected by the situation of other @entity22 in the world			1
there is a popular saying of the @entity98 's that the @entity22 community is like one body : if one part hurts , the entire body feels the pain			2
@entity22 are very aware of this message and , in the last 20 years , three conflicts have continuously dominated the @entity22 consciousness : @entity107 , @entity108 and , most notably , @entity54			0
@entity19 recognized this when he chose his first interview as president to be with a reporter from @entity113 , indicating he would actively engage @entity115 media			1
the @entity118 - @entity117 issue dominated the interview , with @entity19 promising to work toward a solution involving both sides of the conflict			2
to understand the challenge @entity19 faces in changing @entity30 's role in the conflict , one must realize the situation he walked into as president			0
@entity22 around the world were watching the suffering of innocent @entity118 civilians in a @entity132 military campaign conducted with a green light from the @entity62 administration			1
@entity19 is essentially trying to rebuild a relationship that has been destroyed			0
however , @entity19 's tone of respect and not condescension , a clear break with the past , improves the chances that such a relationship could arise			1
his interview with @entity113 was filled with reassuring statements that @entity30 is " ready to initiate a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest , " that " the language we use has to be a language of respect			1
" after years of hearing rhetoric of " a crusade " and " @entity153 " from the @entity30 government , @entity19 's policy of listening , not dictating , has generated optimism in the @entity22 world			1
i am sure that the @entity22 world will respond with goodwill as well			1
already , @entity19 is very well - respected there for his intelligence , eloquence and experience living in the largest @entity22 country , @entity164			2
muslims abroad are just as willing as those in @entity30 to taste his message of hope and change			0
to win over the skeptics abroad , @entity19 will just have to do what he is doing in @entity30 : reach out to all sides for solutions and follow up his words with concrete action			0
in the meantime , the next few weeks will see muslims around the world taking the hand @entity30 is extending after a long hiatus			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			0

@entity183 : @entity19 is reaching out to @entity22 world with words , actions
she says @entity22 worldwide have a *shared* concern about key issues
@entity2 : @entity19 's interview with @entity113 talked of respect and partnership
she says @entity62 administration used harsh language of crusade , *islamofascism*
