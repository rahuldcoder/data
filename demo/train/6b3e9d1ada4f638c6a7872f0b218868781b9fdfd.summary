-- their cvs combined look like the envy of all bona fide air adventurers			0
pioneering ultralight aircraft ? been there			0
setting world records by circling the globe nonstop in a balloon ? done that			0
commanding the first ever 24 - hour flight on a plane powered just by the sun ? yep , you 've guessed it			2
and now , following 12 years of complex designs and intense training , aviation pioneers @entity19 and @entity20 are set to conquer new heights , taking up the challenge of the first solar flight around the globe			1
the @entity26 duo unveiled last week @entity27 2 , a revolutionary aircraft designed to achieve the longest ever flight in the history of aviation in terms of duration for a single pilot			1
it will attempt to fly non-stop for 120 hours ( yes , that 's five successive days and nights ) over oceans and continents without a drop of fuel			1
made of carbon fiber , @entity27 2 is the evolution of a prototype that has smashed several aviation records in recent years , including the first fully solar - powered overnight flight lasting 26 hours in 2010			1
the upgraded plane has a huge wingspan of 72 meters , wider than a standard @entity49 , and weighs only 2,300 kilos -- that 's about as heavy as a family car			0
its wings are covered with a skin of 17,000 solar cells that supply four electric motors with renewable energy , while its custom - made lithium batteries are able to store enough solar energy throughout the day to keep the ultralight plane flying at night			1
" what we have now is the first airplane in the world which has unlimited endurance , " says 62 - year - old @entity20 , a father of three , who was the one in the cockpit in 2010 's record - breaking flight			1
" it can fly a day and a night , it can fly a week , it can fly a month -- theoretically it can fly a year , " he adds			2
" it 's the most energy efficient airplane ever built			0
" 20 - minute sleeping inside the airplane 's tiny cockpit , measuring about one and a half the interior volume of a 2013 @entity78 , every detail has been calculated to achieve maximum energy efficiency while ensuring the pilot can live there for several days			1
its structure is surrounded by a high - density foam to protect the pilot from temperatures ranging from -40Â ° @entity86 in the absence of heating and air conditioning			0
there is enough space for food , water and oxygen supplies , while a multipurpose seat , which comes packed with a parachute and a life - raft , functions as a toilet			0
it also reclines to allow the captain to perform physical exercises to keep blood circulation going as well as take a nap -- but only for up to 20 minutes			0
" we 've learned to do what we call polyphasic sleep , " says @entity20 , referring to the practice of sleeping several times over a day			2
" you need to know how to rest , how to eat , when to go to the toilet and how to keep the body functioning			0
of course , we 've also prepared for the worst -- how to jump out if it 's necessary , how to survive in the ocean with a small life raft and how to get rescued			0
" to achieve all that , @entity19 and @entity20 have spent countless days and nights inside flight simulators over the last few years			1
but while technical training is crucial , @entity19 says preparing yourself mentally is as important			2
" you have to be ready in your head to really visualize all the solutions , " says @entity19			2
" all the positive emotions around the flight that will last five to six days alone over the ocean , and also visualize how to enjoy it -- otherwise it 's very , very difficult			0
" it runs in the family if there 's someone who knows about difficult , if not impossible , undertakings , then that 's @entity19 , a third - generation adventurer			1
his grandfather was the first man to make it to the stratosphere in a balloon while his father was the first to reach the deepest point of the @entity142 's oceans , the @entity134 at nearly 11,000 meters			0
following in their footsteps , @entity19 developed a passion for aviation early on			2
starting out as a teenager , he soon became one of the pioneers of ultralight flying and won several hang - glider aerobatics competitions			2
in march 1999 , he completed the first non-stop round - the - world balloon flight with @entity154 from the @entity155 , while four years later he joined forces with @entity20 , an aviator , entrepreneur and mechanical engineer , to embark on their lofty mission to build a solar aircraft that could circle the world with no polluting emissions			1
" in my family tradition there has always been the scientific exploration and the protection of the environment -- so this is what drives me , " says 56 - year - old @entity19 , who is also a doctor , psychiatrist , and a father of three			1
" ( to ) have an interesting and exciting life but also have a useful life for others , " he adds			0
indeed , more than just setting new records , it 's this desire to chart a sustainable path for future generations that seems to motivate the @entity27 founders -- when asked whether he was at all afraid of undertaking once again something that 's never been done before , @entity19 is unequivocal			1
" to be really honest , " he says decisively , " i am very afraid of living in a world that burns one million tons of oil every hour -- without even counting gas and coal ; a world that is destroying the planet and the environment , " he continues			0
" i am much less afraid to fly in a solar - powered airplane because solar power is one of the solutions for the future			1
a future without fuel following last week 's unveiling , @entity19 and @entity20 are now set to begin test flights in mid-may before embarking on their 35,000 - kilometer journey in march 2015			1
starting from the @entity204 in the @entity205 , the two pilots will then fly over @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 , cross the @entity209 , the @entity210 and the @entity211 with the aim of returning to their departure point			1
with a sluggish top speed of just 88 miles per hour , each ocean crossing will last five to six days , taking the total flight time up to 20 - 25 days over the course of a few months			2
" because it 's a single pilot and the plane flies slowly , we 're going to land on every continent and switch the pilot , " explains @entity19			0
" so one of us will make the @entity209 , one will make the @entity211 ; one will cross @entity208 the other one will cross @entity210 and so on			1
" each stop on their itinerary will last for several days as the @entity27 team wants to organize public events to raise awareness about a more sustainable way of life			1
" this is really the message we want to spread , " says @entity19			0
" with clean technology , with renewable energy we can achieve incredible things without any fuel at all			0

@entity19 and @entity20 have unveiled @entity27 2
the solar - powered aircraft will attempt to circle the globe next year
it will have to fly non-stop for five days and nights crossing the @entity209 and the @entity211
the aviation pioneers want to raise awareness about clean energy
