" many of @entity1 's novels are book club favorites , and not just in her native @entity38			1
her novel " @entity40 " sold more than 1 million copies in the @entity42			1
she spoke to @entity0 about putting parenting onto the pages of her novels			1
below is an edited transcript			1
@entity0 : how are you able to replicate conversations that so many parents have ? @entity52 : i guess it just means that we 're all having the same kinds of conversations across the world ... that they 're universal			2
and , obviously , because i 'm completely in that world right now , it 's really easy to think like that , because that 's the life i 'm leading			1
@entity0 : did you have any of those conversations ? @entity52 : they 're still fictional			2
although , there might be little phrases taken from real life , but they 're still all fiction			2
because it 's my world , the material is at my fingertips			1
@entity0 : how do you find inspiration for your plots and your characters ? @entity52 : i was inspired by a little story a girlfriend told me when her daughter started school			2
on the very first day of kindergarten , two little girls came out of the classroom , and they had bite marks on their arms			2
because it was the first day of school , no one could say who had done it			2
they just said a little boy had done it to them			2
they actually got the little boys to line up			2
when this girlfriend was telling me the story , i was just so enthralled by the little drama that went on in the playground , and imagining how you would feel if you were one of the parents , hoping that it was n't your child that had actually done the biting			2
in the end , the little girls finally gave in and admitted they had bitten themselves			0
it 's little stories like that ( which inspire me )			1
people tell stories of awful parents , and bullying parents			0
and you can definitely see the potential , because you do love your child so fiercely			0
because it is a little bit like going back to school yourself			0
it brings out all those insecurities			0
when all the parties started , and sometimes , i remember hearing about certain parties , thinking , ' my child was n't invited			0
what does that mean ? ' all those things come out			0
it 's easy to collect on that material			1
@entity0 : have you been surprised by how your books have transcended cultural boundaries ? @entity52 : i think as parents , we 're all leading similar sorts of lives			0
so really , the differences are small			0
and i think they 're differences that readers quite enjoy , in the same way that i enjoy reading books set in the @entity42 there are things like trick or treating and @entity147 , and little things like that			1
they 're a pleasure to read , but easy enough to understand , so you do n't feel alienated			0
@entity0 : what are you working on now ? @entity52 : i 'm just in the very early stages of my next novel			0
i 've been joking a lot that my next novel will be set on a tropical island			0
and i 'll have to lots of research to get the setting right			0
the more i joke , the more i 've started to think , ' actually , that could work			0
' because i often like to set my books in a confined setting , a little village ...			0
that 's why a school works so well , because you can control it			1
so why not a tropical island ? @entity0 : has your success changed the way other parents treat you ? @entity52 : they tease me			0
my husband was taking some time off , and announcing he was going to do some more of the pick - ups ( from school )			0
and somebody was saying , ' will you still do some of the pick - ups ? ' somebody else was saying , ' of course she will			0
she needs us for her material			0
' they just seem happy for me			0
it 's not like i 'm a film star			1
it 's not especially glamorous .			1
