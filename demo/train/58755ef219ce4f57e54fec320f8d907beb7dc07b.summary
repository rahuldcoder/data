-- yes , i said it , and i will say it again : on wednesday night , sen. @entity4 was a hero for civil liberties			1
i love and respect president @entity6 , and i was honored to work for the @entity6 @entity7			0
that said , the executive branch of the @entity11 government today has an extraordinary level of power			1
progressives like rep. @entity15 and conservatives like @entity4 can all agree it has a disturbing license to wage a never - ending , ill - defined , even un-defined " war on terror , " including the use of drones			1
i applaud @entity4 for standing up and calling attention to an important and vexing set of questions			1
now , let me say to my conservative friends : do not get too excited			0
i still believe @entity4 is as much a villain on civil rights as he was a hero this week on civil liberties			1
the rev. @entity28 's successful strategy was to force the federal government to intercede not just with states , but also private businesses that denied equal treatment			1
@entity4 would have robbed @entity28 's strategy of its teeth , because he does not believe the commerce clause of the @entity37 grants the federal government the right to protect individuals from racial discrimination in the marketplace			1
in fact , he once said businesses should be able to turn people away based on the color of their skin			0
also , please do not get me started on his votes against the @entity48			0
nor on his opposition to a woman 's right to make private medical decisions			2
nor on his desire to cut @entity54 and @entity55 , while preserving tax loopholes for the wealthiest people ever born			0
but we can not be so balkanized as a nation that we refuse to say " well done , " when someone does right , even if we disagree on everything else			2
we are bigger than that			0
the idea of using military drones inside @entity11 borders should trigger concern and scrutiny from all points on the political spectrum			0
to my progressive friends : the argument should not be whether we trust this president not to abuse that kind of authority			0
if a @entity78 president refused to rule out killing @entity11 citizens on @entity11 soil without due process , we progressives would be marching down the street			2
we must be vigilant and consistent			0
there is a risk that any @entity7 will develop delusions about its own power			2
the amount of information that top officials get is so overwhelming , and the level of responsibility so crushing , that there is always the temptation to think , " we know more than the public			0
" it is a shame that it was @entity4 , not progressives and liberals in the @entity98 , who led this filibuster			1
not only that , we can admire that @entity4 used the filibuster the way it should be used			1
he did not simply stick a post-it note on a door somewhere and leave town , solely to gum up the government			0
too many @entity78 have done that during this president 's time in office			2
he said that this is an important issue , and we should be talking about it more -- repeatedly , for 13 hours			0
that 's not a stunt			2
that 's the way the filibuster is supposed to work			1
if you want to see a stunt , pay more attention to the excessive abuse of the filibuster over the last four years			1
fortunately , attorney general @entity124 sent @entity4 a commendable letter ruling out strikes on noncombatant americans on @entity11 soil			1
but at the end of the day , i still do not believe the @entity11 public has a clear understanding of the extent and limits of the drone program			2
for example , what about @entity11 overseas -- and what about the hundreds of innocent civilian lives lost to terrifying drone strikes around the world ? getting rid of unilateral kill lists will not elevate our moral position if we continue to be responsible for innocent deaths			2
in addition to the lives lost , we inflict tremendous trauma on children who witness these attacks , and unmeasurable psychological damage on parents who never know if this day will be their last			0
decent and fair - minded @entity11 should focus not only on drones that target @entity11 , but also on drone strikes that shock our conscience			0
we need to have a national conversation , and that is what @entity4 started on wednesday			1
no matter what you think of his other views , we can all agree that this conversation can not end here			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			1

@entity164 : @entity4 *deserves* credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues
@entity164 says @entity4 spoke out against excessive executive power and for civil liberties
he says the @entity174 senator is completely wrong on civil rights , *abortion* , *entitlements*
@entity164 : progressives can *salute* @entity4 's filibuster even as they disagree with his other views
