-- thursday was quite the day for movie news , between " @entity2 : the @entity3 " and " @entity4 4 , " but we also got new , final looks at two of this holiday season 's highest profile films as well			2
the first trailer for " @entity24 " gave us a taste of what to expect , but the final one gave us @entity13 belting it out and a look at the cast of fairy tale characters , including @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity21 's @entity20 and more -- not to mention @entity22 as the @entity23			2
going by this , it looks like the lines will be long to check out @entity29 's wondrous big musical on christmas day			0
meanwhile , " @entity30 : @entity34 " was no slouch in the wonder department , delivering as - usual astounding special effects			1
they 're all there : @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and all those hunky dwarves			0
and as promised , it looks like there 's a huge battle coming			0
the real question is : between " @entity30 " or " @entity24 , " which will be a bigger hit during the holidays ?			1
