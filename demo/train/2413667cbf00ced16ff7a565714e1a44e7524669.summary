-- analysts say the slaying of one of @entity5 's best - known folk singers over the weekend shines a spotlight on problems with deep roots in @entity9 : violence , impunity and the pervasive presence of organized crime " it shows how far these groups have infiltrated			1
... it 's a very large blow first of all to the country 's image , and secondly to its government , " said @entity16 , a professor of political science at the @entity18 in @entity19			1
gunmen ambushed @entity27 folk singer @entity26 when he was on his way to the airport in the nation 's capital saturday , authorities said			1
as investigators continued searching for suspects monday , the high - profile shooting drew increasing attention throughout @entity5 , where @entity26 gained fame as a protest singer who pushed for peace			1
" the @entity9 people are quite shocked and outraged , and we have to face the situation like others we have faced in a country that is fighting to get out of this state of violence that has hit us so hard , " @entity9 president @entity39 said in an interview monday with @entity42 's @entity41			1
corruption and violence are high in @entity9 , according to the @entity53 , which created a committee in 2006 to investigate those issues there			1
more than 200,000 people have been killed in @entity9 since 1970 , mostly as a result of organized crime , drug - trade violence and a 36 - year civil war that ended in 1996			1
violence in @entity9 drew international attention in may after investigators found the bodies of 27 dismembered and decapitated workers on a farm in a northern border province -- brutal evidence of what officials and analysts said is a dramatic spike in violence across the region as @entity42 drug cartels expand their reach			2
@entity39 monday attributed @entity26 's killing to " organized crime , " telling @entity41 that evidence indicated the @entity81 businessman driving him to the airport was the attackers ' intended target			1
but analyst @entity85 cautioned that in the run - up to @entity9 's september elections , government officials may have different motives in describing the situation			2
" to say that this famous @entity27 musician was n't a target lends credence to the idea that @entity9 's a safe place to travel for musicians or just in general , " said @entity85 , the managing director of @entity91 , an online information network focused on @entity5			2
it 's possible that hit - men targeted @entity26 , @entity85 said			2
" groups like @entity102 have killed people simply for the songs that they sung publicly			0
my question was , what did he sing ? what was his playlist ? ... it could have been just that simple , " he added			0
in recent weeks , @entity9 officials have touted arrests of members of @entity102 as a sign that they 're cracking down on crime			0
@entity26 's killing is one of many indications that the government 's efforts have seen limited results , @entity16 said			0
" the ( criminal ) organizations ' structures have not been damaged			0
yes , there are a few accomplishments , but the long - term impact is n't so large , " he said			0
@entity127 , an assistant professor of public policy at @entity129 who published an analysis of violence and politics in the @entity134 country last year , said @entity26 's killing is " very striking			1
" " it makes people sit up and take note , but the fact is that this is really not a new phenomenon in @entity9 , " he said			0
drug - fueled organized crime has had a strong presence in the @entity134 country for decades , he said			1
" this is probably a depressingly familiar story for most @entity9			0
... the single dominant theme of @entity9 politics is citizen insecurity , " @entity127 said			0
" the basic problem in @entity9 is that the crime is so deeply rooted in the social and institutional structures of the country that it 's going to take a sort of exorcism to solve the problem			2
" journalist @entity154 contributed to this report .			0
