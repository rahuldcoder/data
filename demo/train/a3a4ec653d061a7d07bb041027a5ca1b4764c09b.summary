an online video showing a now - former @entity2 official in her underwear has sparked a debate over the privacy of government workers in the @entity8 country -- and cost the official her job this week			1
the video shows @entity12 , who had been @entity2 's vice minister of culture and youth since 2006 , lying on a bed in her underwear and apparently talking to her lover			1
i love you with all my soul			0
and everything that you see here is yours , " she says			0
the cultural ministry said monday that @entity12 would be leaving her post after a surge in journalistic reports and social media posts " connected with the private life of the vice minister			1
" " even though the information that has circulated is strictly related with the private life of @entity12 , and not with her work as a public official , she was released from her post so that she could face this in the private sphere , " the cultural ministry said in a statement , adding @entity2 's president authorized the move			1
@entity12 , 39 , told @entity38 tuesday that she recorded the private video in 2007 , when she was separated from her husband , a @entity2 congressman			1
" it is a very old and personal video of mine , that really makes me very embarrassed with the @entity2 people and i apologize , especially before the youth who i represent			0
... but also it has nothing that i should be ashamed of , and i think an injustice has been committed , " she said			0
@entity12 said she did not have a chance to defend herself before she lost her job			2
" i think as a woman , i had a right to defend myself and to speak			0
these are questions of my intimate private life that have nothing to do with my work , " she said			2
a computer engineer that her family had hired to install security cameras stole the video and tried to blackmail her to stop its release , she said			1
" it is very difficult to prove because he is a computer engineer and he is one of those people that hacks and steals accounts , and ... because my husband is a congressman and i am a vice minister , he took advantage of the situation to get money out of us , " she said			2
by tuesday evening , the video had been viewed more than 370,000 times on @entity76 .			0
