-- @entity2 captain @entity1 has dismissed suggestions his team have been handed an easy draw for the group stage of the @entity7 in @entity8			1
@entity1 , 33 , is out of his team 's opening match with @entity11 in @entity12 on saturday , as @entity2 look to reach a third successive @entity15 final and repeat their victorious campaign at @entity17 2003			1
@entity11 , who finished third at the 2007 tournament in @entity20 , look set to present @entity22 's team with their toughest test of the opening round , with @entity2 's archrivals @entity25 and minnows @entity27 and @entity28 making up the rest of @entity30 " no , there 's no such thing , " the @entity31 told @entity0 when asked if his team 's group was easy			1
" there really is n't , i mean people will say that but it 's certainly not the case			2
" @entity11 finished third in the last @entity15 , @entity25 have beaten @entity41 ... we have a very big challenge in this tournament and first is making sure that we come out of the group in as strong a position as we can against tough opposition			1
" you know it 's just great that every nation that 's involved in this @entity15 is really lifting their standards and you know that every game you 're going to be playing is going to be tough			1
" the @entity7 will see @entity54 make their debut at the quadrennial competition , and @entity1 is convinced the sport 's continued expansion into new territories bodes well for the future			1
" more people are getting involved and will take it [ rugby ] back to their countries and , if they 've done well , they will have all that support and it will grow their fan base in those countries , " @entity61 added			0
" it 's great for the sport			0
" @entity1 has already been a world champion once in his career , as part of the team which , captained by current coach @entity22 , defeated hosts @entity17 to lift the @entity76 in 2003			2
along with fly - half @entity77 , who kicked the drop goal which won the final eight years ago , @entity1 is one of only two @entity7 squad members who played in that historic match in @entity82			2
" i remember being very nervous for a vast majority [ of the final ] because i was sat on the bench and all your anticipation , your anxieties , they are all with you until step across that white line on the pitch			0
" when i did get on , i remember @entity95 calling the line out with a minute to go with me at the back and , thankfully , @entity94 threw it , i caught it , the ball went to @entity100 and the rest is history			0
" @entity100 managed to get the ball to @entity77 , who then kicked the drop goal			0
it was an incredible occasion and one that will stick with you for very fond reasons			0
