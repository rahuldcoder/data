@entity0 -- latinos in the @entity4 are divided over a host of issues , including what to do about unauthorized immigrants , a reflection of the national political controversy over illegal immigration , a national study released thursday finds			1
slightly more than half of the nation 's @entity13 say illegal immigrants should pay a small fine but not be deported , according to a report by the @entity18			1
another 28 percent of the @entity13 respondents to the @entity18 poll say unauthorized immigrants should not be punished			2
on the other side , 13 percent say they should be deported			0
explainer : illegal immigration 101 latinos also are feeling increased concerns about discrimination , again the result of the national controversy over illegal immigration , the survey found			1
this year , 61 percent of @entity25 say discrimination is a " major problem , " an increase from the 54 percent who categorized it that way in 2007 , @entity18 said			1
" asked to state the most important factor leading to discrimination , a plurality of 36 percent now cites immigration status , up from a minority of 23 percent who said the same in 2007 , " the report states			1
" back then , a plurality of respondents -- 46 percent -- identified language skills as the biggest cause of discrimination against @entity13			0
" in addition , the @entity18 report says , @entity25 are divided about the impact of illegal immigration on hispanics living in the @entity4			1
" roughly equal shares say the impact has been positive ( 29 percent ) , negative ( 31 percent ) or made no difference ( 30 percent ) , " the report says			0
" this mixed judgment stands in sharp contrast to views that @entity25 expressed on this subject in 2007			2
back then , fully half ( 50 percent ) of @entity25 said the impact was positive , while just 20 percent said it was negative			2
" the latest survey also finds that @entity25 are divided over whether immigrant and native - born @entity13 are working together to achieve common political goals			1
about half ( 45 percent ) say they are and about half ( 46 percent ) say they are not			0
both the native born ( who comprise 47 percent of the adult latino population ) and the foreign born ( who comprise 53 percent ) are roughly equally divided on their perceptions of political solidarity , @entity18 said			1
" the native born and foreign born have different views on many topics explored in the survey , " the report says			0
" for example , seven in 10 ( 70 percent ) foreign - born @entity25 say discrimination against @entity13 is a major problem preventing @entity25 from succeeding in @entity4			2
less than half ( 49 percent ) of the native born agree			0
" and when it comes to their views of immigrants , fewer than seven in 10 native - born @entity13 say immigrants strengthen the country , while 85 percent of immigrant @entity13 say the same			0
" although the survey found differences of opinion among @entity25 , it also revealed areas of broad agreement			1
for example , @entity18 said , 86 percent of @entity25 support providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants if they pass background checks , pay a fine and have jobs			1
that level of support surpasses the 68 percent of the general public who favor such a path to citizenship , @entity18 said			2
among @entity25 , 82 percent of the native born and 90 percent of the foreign born say they support providing that path			0
latinos also are united in their opposition to @entity111 's @entity110 , a controversial law enacted this year that authorizes police to check the immigration status of anyone who is being investigated for another suspected crime			1
according to @entity18 , 79 percent of @entity25 oppose the measure , most of which has been stayed pending a lawsuit by the federal government			1
the @entity18 found this year that the general population supports the law by a 2 - to - 1 ratio			0
with regard to rising concerns about a backlash triggered by illegal immigration , the @entity18 survey found no increase over past years in the percentage of @entity25 who report that they or someone they know have been targets of discrimination or have been stopped by authorities and asked about their immigration status			1
about one - third of all @entity25 ( 34 percent ) say they , a member of their family or a close friend have experienced discrimination in the past five years because of their race or ethnic group , @entity18 said			1
that amount is largely unchanged from 2009 , when it stood at 32 percent			0
perhaps even more significantly , only 5 percent said they had been stopped by police or other authorities and asked about their immigration status , down from 9 percent in 2008			1
despite the immigration controversy , @entity18 also found that @entity25 are more satisfied this year with the direction of the @entity4			1
thirty - six percent said they are satisfied , a significant increase over the 25 percent who said the same thing in 2008			0
by contrast , the @entity18 in a late summer survey found 25 percent of the general public satisfied with the country 's direction			2
latinos also remain as upbeat about their lives as they were three years ago , @entity18 said , with 24 percent rating it as " excellent " and 45 percent as " good			2
" about 80 percent on the nation 's estimated 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants are of @entity161 origin			0
@entity25 are the nation 's largest minority			0
the 47 million @entity13 in the @entity4 make up nearly 15 percent of the nation 's population			0
about 38 percent of the nation 's latinos are immigrants			0
of those , about 19 percent are unauthorized			0
the study results come from a new national survey of 1,375 @entity13 adults conducted by land line and cellular telephones in @entity175 and @entity176 from august 17 through september 19 , @entity18 said			1
the margin of error is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points for the full sample and larger for subgroups			0
the @entity18 is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues			0
it is part of the @entity18 , a nonpartisan institute based in @entity0 that is funded by @entity185 , a @entity186 - based public charity .			2

the divisions come from the national political *row* over illegal immigration , @entity18 says
latinos also feel heightened concerns over discrimination based on immigration status
but @entity25 also share areas of broad agreement , such as their opposition to @entity110
the survey of 1,375 latinos was conducted in august and september
