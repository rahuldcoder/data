-- fans of classic 1970 's films like " network " and " @entity4 " should flock to " the @entity5 , " @entity7 's fourth outing as a director and second produced screenplay			1
it 's a taut and engaging political thriller that should resonate with @entity11 of any political persuasion			2
@entity15 , left - wing @entity14 gov. @entity13 ( @entity7 ) is in the fight of his life , running for the @entity19 nomination for president			1
he leads in the polls and the delegate count , but anything can happen in the week before the primary and a potential spoiler / kingmaker waits in the wings in the form of @entity30 sen. @entity29 ( @entity31 )			0
the old saying of " as @entity34 goes , so goes the nation " implies that a win in the primary is the key			0
however , sen. @entity29 controls a large group of delegates who are likely to go to whatever candidate he endorses			0
so while trying to win @entity34 , both @entity13 and his rival are at the same time clandestinely courting @entity29 's favors , with @entity46 reporter @entity45 ( @entity47 ) doggedly looking for the scoop			1
with so much of modern politics playing out in the media , the results often hinge on the dance between campaign and reporter			2
this complicated @entity56 with @entity47 's reporter is performed on the campaign side by grizzled veteran campaign manager @entity59 ( @entity60 ) and hotshot young press secretary @entity62 ( @entity61 )			1
( which kind of makes it a @entity66 , but never mind			0
) @entity61 is at the center of the film , once again proving that he is more than capable of holding his own in a group of heavyweights , inhabiting @entity75 like he 's been playing him on stage for years			1
in fact , " the @entity5 " is adapted from @entity80 's play " @entity81			1
" ambitious and aggressively idealistic , the only thing @entity75 cares about more than winning is believing in his candidate , which of course sets him apart from virtually all the real - world political operators working inside the @entity87 and sets him up for a vicious life lesson			1
as gov. @entity13 , @entity7 is at his best , with his campaign speeches and television appearances echoing @entity92 , but with a charm that leans more towards the urbane than the folksy			1
at one point @entity13 flat out tells a debate audience not to vote for him if they do n't agree with his positions on the issues			0
imagine ! it is in the private moments , however , that the true , cynical face of politics shows its face and it is in this cynicism that " @entity5 " finds its true footing			2
a throwback film in a sense , " @entity5 " is not the " @entity112 " look at politics and things get ugly			2
an old saw is that working in politics is a great place to meet women and this holds true here , as @entity75 meets young , aggressive campaign intern @entity120 ( @entity119 ) and their short and rather unsubtle flirtation leads to a series of events that , before they conclude , affect virtually everyone involved in dramatic ways and shakes @entity75 ' beliefs to the core			0
at one point the 30 - year - old @entity75 brags that he 's worked on more campaigns than most people have by the time they 're 40 , but @entity60 's @entity133 and equally seasoned rival campaign manager @entity134 ( @entity135 ) in turn play @entity75 like a violin , proving that " @entity138 " was right : trust no one			1
to which i would add : and keep your mouth shut			0
in essence , " @entity5 " is about tests			2
a test of idealism in the face of reality and a test of political resolve in the face of events that shake conviction			0
@entity61 's @entity75 is playing with the big boys and navigating the often ethically muddy waters of presidential politics is not for the faint of heart			1
it is also about compromise			0
how much of your ideals , integrity and reputation are you willing to sacrifice for " the greater good " and does that greater good actually exist ? while the choices may be integrity vs. career and ethics vs. ambition , it 's not always clear which choice will produce which result			0
despite @entity7 's outspoken left - leaning politics , this is a film without a partisan agenda and one that both sides of the aisle ought to see and in which they may quite possibly see themselves			1
it 's an entertaining , suspenseful and deeply cynical film , but politics is a cynical business and maybe this will be seen as a cautionary tale ... though i doubt it			0
was that too cynical ?			0

@entity7 heads up a star - *studded* cast in " the @entity5 "
the political drama follows the presidential campaign of a @entity14 *governor*
