-- bull markets in @entity2 tend not to last long			2
over the past two decades , in an environment of low growth and persistent deflation , the best strategy for globally minded investors has been to get in early and then get out again , once the index has risen about 20 per cent			0
" normally we get our moment in the sun once every 18 months , " chuckles @entity9 , head of equity research at @entity11 , now in his 27th year of tracking the @entity13 market			1
last year was a good one , with a rally in early spring and another still in progress , set off by expectations of more aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus under @entity23 , the country 's returning prime minister			1
from the time former premier @entity26 called an election in mid-november , to the close of the @entity13 market for the new year holidays , the nikkei 225 stock average rose by a fifth , outperforming 92 of 94 equity benchmarks around the world			1
foreigners led , snapping up a net @entity34 ( $ 21bn ) of stocks in the six weeks before @entity36			0
but as the @entity2 market reopens on friday , investors should not necessarily be eyeing the exits , say strategists			0
while it is too early to judge whether mr @entity23 's reflationary policies will be successful , they say , the stage he has set -- featuring a weaker yen and a looser central bank -- should support stocks for a while yet			1
" look around the world , " says @entity47 , chief @entity2 strategist at @entity48 in @entity13 , paraphrasing a recent comment from one of her clients			1
" the @entity54 still has its fiscal cliff problem , @entity53 keeps muddling through and @entity57 's direction under its new leaders is uncertain			2
" in that context , " @entity2 is the clearest macro game in town "			0
more inflows from abroad seem likely , say analysts			0
for one thing , valuations are inexpensive			0
of the five cheapest holdings of @entity67 , an @entity69 fund which seeks out companies with low enterprise values but strong cash flows , four are @entity2			0
" we 'd never say this is the start of a multiyear bull run but we do know the stocks we own here still look attractive , " says @entity73 , the fund 's co-manager			2
the yen is on track to record eight consecutive weeks of losses against the @entity54 dollar , which is something it has not achieved since 1989			0
a weaker currency should improve sales volumes and profit margins for exporters , which have become the primary engine of extremely cyclical growth in the world 's third - largest economy			1
but perhaps the strongest reason for continuing to put on the so - called " @entity23 trade " , say analysts , is the desire of the new prime minister to consolidate his hold on power			1
last month 's victory in the lower - house elections has given the @entity101 a two - thirds " supermajority " , in tandem with its alliance partner			2
however , the coalition is short of a majority in parliament 's upper house , where the @entity109 of @entity2 still holds sway			2
if mr @entity23 can steer his party to victory in july , when half the upper - house seats are up for grabs , he could , in theory , enjoy an election - free reign stretching out to 2016			1
for the next six months , mr @entity23 's government will be " using all its political power " to push stocks up and the currency down , says @entity122 , senior global markets analyst at @entity124 in @entity125			1
after that , say analysts , gains may be harder to come by			0
in the absence of real structural reforms to increase @entity2 's potential growth rate , the market may not take off like it did between 2003 and 2005 under the administration of @entity134 , says ms @entity47 of @entity48			2
in the past couple of months @entity2 has been " a ' close - your - eyes - and - buy ' market " , says @entity137 , chief global strategist at @entity138 in @entity139 , noting that stocks that had been " priced for technical insolvency " , such as @entity141 , have rallied the hardest			0
but most feel that mr @entity23 deserves a little faith			1
@entity145 , a @entity125 - based director at @entity146 , the @entity148 asset management arm of @entity149 , has seen 14 prime ministers come and go since the early 1990s			2
he says he runs his $ 80m portfolio by focusing on what companies do " in spite of politics -- not because of it "			0
but with mr @entity23 , " at least you have a party with an agenda and a fairly clear mandate			1
if nothing else , this opens the door to a better policy making process			0
" @entity165 , senior portfolio manager at @entity166 , which runs one of the biggest @entity2 equity funds outside @entity2 , says it will take months , if not years , to judge the success of mr @entity23 's " great reflation experiment "			1
but for the time being " it feels much too early to be too cynical , " he says			0

the @entity176 has outperformed 92 of 94 equity benchmarks around the world since november
expectations high of more aggressive with @entity23 , the country 's returning prime minister
