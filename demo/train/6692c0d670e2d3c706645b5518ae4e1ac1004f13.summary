-- a co-founder of the @entity2 said thursday that she felt sorry for the young woman diagnosed with rare " flesh - eating " bacterial infection when she heard about her this week in media reports			1
" first thing i thought when i saw the news was , ' oh , how tragic , another case ! ' " said @entity7 in a telephone interview about the first report of @entity10 , a 24 - year - old graduate student at @entity11 who had lost a leg and was expected to lose her fingers to the infection			1
though there is uncertainty about just how common such infections are since no clearinghouse compiles statistics on their incidence , dr. @entity18 , chairman of the @entity19 at the @entity20 , estimates there are fewer than 250 cases every year in the @entity29			1
the reporting of such cases is not required by law			1
flesh - eating bacteria explained " i get e-mails about these cases every single day , " said @entity7 , who noted that news coverage of such cases is far rarer than the infections themselves are			1
" if you look at our foundation and our @entity43 page , there 's discussion constantly among thousands of people , but it just is n't sexy for the media			1
" still , this week 's tv and print pieces about @entity51 did not surprise @entity7			1
" it was a cute girl that everyone can relate to , " she said			2
in addition , @entity51 's relatives have made themselves available to reporters and her classmates have been vocal in their support			1
@entity51 ' in high spirits , ' father says " every three or four years or so it happens , where a case will take off in the media , " said @entity7 , who is based in northern @entity62			1
but @entity7 said she was grateful for the coverage , whatever the motivation			1
not only has her foundation received a " substantial " increase in donations since the cases went public , but the stories may have some educational value			1
if people seek quicker treatment next time they get a cut that results in a rapidly spreading infection , causes pain disproportionate to the size of the cut and is associated with flulike symptoms , then the goals of her group will be furthered , she said			1
group a streptoccal bacteria , the same bacteria that cause strep throat , are the main culprits , although -- as occurred in @entity51 's case -- other bacteria can also result in the disease , known to doctors as necrotizing fasciitis , @entity7 said			1
" you 're fine when you go to bed at night , but you wake up in the morning with your leg twice the size and turning black and you have a 105 or above fever , " she said			2
" i 've known many , many cases where people have died within 24 hours			1
" @entity7 herself survived the infection			1
" eighteen years ago , i had a surgery on my abdomen after a c - section for my twins , " she said			2
" by the time they finally found out what was wrong with me , my flesh was falling off in the nurse 's hands			2
" @entity115 woman ' very ill , but stable ' after recovering , she and a fellow survivor founded the website			2
in the 12 years since , tens of thousands of people have told their stories on the site about the disease , she said			2
" i 'm happy to see that it 's again getting some attention , " she said			1
" the biggest problem we have is missed diagnosis			2
so , if somebody goes into the @entity130 , invariably they 're turned away			2
by the time they go back , they 've reached the advanced stages of the disease and they 're either losing limbs or losing their lives			1
" that comes close to describing what happened to @entity140			2
in 1995 , the 41 - year - old triathlete was gardening in his yard outside @entity143			2
as he set about transplanting a tree , he lifted its 2 - inch trunk , which was attached to a 2 - foot - wide root ball			0
" one of the roots poked me in my calf , and i did n't even know it , " he said			0
" within an hour , i felt like i had a @entity153 horse			0
by the end of the day , i was vomiting all the time			1
i felt like i had the flu			0
i went to bed sicker than a dog			0
" a few hours later , at 4 a.m. , his house was struck by lightning and caught fire			0
as firefighters arrived and extinguished it , " i could barely walk around because of the pain in my leg , " he said			0
he went back to bed , in worsening pain			0
" i just started popping a lot more painkillers			0
" at 10 a.m. , with his cut growing fiery , he went to a small regional hospital in nearby @entity172			0
" they checked me in and did n't do anything for two days " except administer antibiotics , he said			0
by then , " this thing had taken over the backside of my leg and was more than halfway up my thigh			0
" his luck turned when a friend , who happened to be a surgeon , recognized that something was awry and arranged for his transfer to another hospital , where doctors immediately recognized the symptoms			0
" within an hour of checking into that hospital , i was in surgery , " he said			0
each night for nearly two weeks , he underwent operations that included removal of the infected tissue and dead flesh			0
" they told me every night for nine nights that they were going to take my leg off , " he said			0
but one of the doctors put it off , saying " i 'm going to take a chance here , " he recalled			0
" she was right , thank goodness			0
i made it through all the surgeries and debridement ( tissue removal ) and living on morphine for 2Â½ weeks ... i was able to survive the whole thing and i walked out of the hospital			0
" but his case , like most of the others he had learned about , generated no interest from the news media			1
" the people who get it are n't 24 and grad students , " he said , referring to @entity51			1
" and she 's got a community of other students			0
... the press has kinda glamorized this one			0

" oh , how tragic , another case ! " says co-founder of the @entity2
" i get e-mails about these cases every single day , " says @entity7
@entity7 says she hopes the coverage will result in faster diagnoses , *saving* limbs and lives
a @entity233 man says that *unlike* his bout with infection , the @entity51 case is getting attention
