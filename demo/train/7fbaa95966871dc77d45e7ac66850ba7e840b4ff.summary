@entity0 , @entity1 -- his phone number was published in a @entity1 phone directory -- @entity6 , whose claims that @entity8 was producing biological agents helped launch the @entity11 war			1
@entity6 says he wants to return to @entity11 to work for his people and his country			1
he was reluctant to speak on the record , initially denying he was @entity11 or that he was the defector dubbed " @entity16 " by the @entity15			1
but eight months after we first contacted him , @entity6 agreed to an interview , and we met in an anonymous hotel room in a southern @entity1 town			1
trying to get details from him was difficult -- he spoke at length , often launching into a flowery history of @entity11 or a description of @entity8 's crimes , and in @entity26 , which meant we had to wait after each answer for a translation			1
we spoke for more than three hours , @entity6 sitting across the room from me , wearing a stylish black suit			1
but in the end , he had n't said very much at all			0
in the run - up to the @entity36 invasion of @entity11 in 2003 , secretary of state @entity33 delivered a dramatic presentation to the @entity38			1
the @entity36 had first - hand accounts , he said , detailing how @entity8 was secretly creating biological agents using mobile laboratories in " road - trailer units and rail cars			2
" as slides depicting drawings of the supposed germ labs flashed on a big screen in the @entity38 's chamber , @entity33 drove his point home : " the source is an eyewitness , an @entity11 chemical engineer , who supervised one of these facilities			1
" just days after @entity33 's presentation , @entity38 weapons inspectors presented evidence they said disproved those claims			2
but six weeks later , on march 20 , 2003 , the @entity36 launched its invasion , toppling @entity8 's government in three weeks but locking itself in a war against an insurgency that has cost more than 4,000 @entity36 lives			1
no biological weapons , no germ labs , no weapons of mass destruction of any kind were found in @entity11 after the invasion			1
@entity16 -- @entity6 -- remained in hiding in @entity1 , where he had been interviewed by the @entity1 intelligence service , the @entity70			1
subsequent @entity36 investigations into the intelligence failure around the claims found that @entity1 intelligence considered the defector " crazy " and " out of control , " while friends said he was a " liar			1
" and , it turned out , the @entity15 not only never spoke with him , it never even saw transcripts of the @entity1 interviews , only the @entity1 ' analysis of the interviews			2
@entity6 brought with him to our meeting documents to prove his identity , certificates saying he has a degree in chemical engineering from @entity90 in @entity91 and a student id card from a @entity1 college			1
multiple intelligence sources told @entity2 that the man we spoke with was , indeed , @entity16			1
but @entity6 told us he never told the @entity70 that @entity11 was producing weapons of mass destruction , and he said many other things said about him were false			1
" there are many wrong statements made about me , and i want to declare it one by one			0
i have documents proving that everything said about me is false , " he said			0
" no , " he said , " i never told anyone @entity8 was producing weapons of mass destruction			0
" when i pressed him about @entity33 's use of his information , @entity6 said in @entity1 with an @entity26 accent , " that is @entity33 's problem			1
" he said that as long as he is living in @entity1 , he will never tell the full story of what information he passed on to the @entity70			2
" it is not true that i am the only person who said things about @entity11 , " he said			2
" there are so many other people who gave information as well			0
right now i am trying to protect my children			0
they have been through hard times with me			0
" and then @entity6 got nervous			2
he wiped his face often and lit a new cigarette after almost every question			0
he seemed uncomfortable in front of the camera			0
@entity6 had brought with him a second man , introduced only as " mr. @entity129			2
" mr. @entity129 was also wearing a flashy suit with a peach - colored shirt , and he seemed to be coaching @entity6 , making strange signals behind my back			2
as i talked to @entity6 , i could feel the wind from mr. @entity129 frantically waving his arms			2
whenever @entity6 began to offer details , mr. @entity129 made a time out signal with his hands , and @entity6 stopped talking			2
when he was n't prevented from talking by mr. @entity129 , @entity6 answered questions in a roundabout manner , sometimes backtracking and correcting himself , sometimes telling completely different stories in the same sentence			2
@entity6 came to @entity1 in 1999 seeking asylum and was picked up by the @entity1 intelligence service , which questioned him			1
according to intelligence sources , @entity6 told the @entity70 that @entity8 had a secret biological weapons program , and that the cover was a seed purification plant in @entity150 , a site just north of @entity91 , where mobile weapons labs in truck trailers would pick up the biological agents			2
it begs the question : how could the @entity70 and @entity15 trust @entity6 's information with the stakes so high ? while he provided little detail during our interview , @entity6 insisted that @entity8 was producing weapons of mass destruction , and that he had worked on one of the weapons projects			1
@entity165 , a former @entity70 officer who is familiar with the @entity16 case , now criticizes the @entity1 intelligence service for its handling of the matter			1
the @entity70 wanted so badly to believe @entity6 , @entity165 said , that the case officers did n't notice inconsistencies in his story			0
" he was put under pressure by the @entity70 : ' tell us something , ' " @entity165 said			0
" they were desperate for something			0
they gave him money , privileges , a visa and the like			0
and so this man used his imagination to get all these things			0
" @entity6 , however , claims he was never " an agent or spy for any intelligence agencies in the world			1
and i never got paid by anyone			0
" @entity190 , the @entity15 's station chief in @entity191 at the time , said he tried to warn his superiors at the agency about using @entity16 's information			1
@entity190 said he thinks the @entity16 case is one of the lowest points in the history of the @entity15 , but he does not believe @entity6 was at fault			1
" he was driven by his own self - preservation , and then he got caught up in the story he was telling , and then he just had to keep going , " @entity190 said			0
@entity202 , who wrote about the case in " @entity16 : lies , @entity205 , and a @entity206 , " called the episode " arguably the biggest intelligence failure in history			0
" " never before have we gone to war on the basis of such an utter and complete fraud , " @entity202 said			0
" after 9/11 , what we heard from the authorities was that they had failed to connect the dots that led to that scandal			0
in this case , they made up the dots			0
" but @entity6 made clear in our meeting that he does not feel remorse			0
he said he wants to return to @entity11 to work for his people and his country			0
and , he said , he feels the @entity11 war was justified			0
" i feel that @entity36 offered to @entity11 what no other country can offer to @entity11 , " he said near the end of the interview			1
" @entity36 sacrificed its people and its money and its position to free a dictatorial country			0

@entity2 speaks to @entity6 , code named " @entity16 "
@entity6 's claims that @entity11 had *wmd* were used to support @entity36 invasion
@entity6 came to @entity1 in 1999 seeking asylum
