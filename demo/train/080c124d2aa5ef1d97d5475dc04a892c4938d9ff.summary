@entity1 chief @entity0 said his trial , which wrapped up friday , was the first time his side of the aggravated pimping case against him has been fully heard			1
he 'll learn june 12 whether investigative magistrates accepted his version			1
a verdict by the @entity10 court will be read on that date			0
the onetime contender for the @entity14 presidency has denied investigators ' accusations that he organized or encouraged sex parties involving prostitutes			0
" for the first time , throughout these last hearings , i felt i could explain myself and i have the feeling i have been listened to , " @entity0 said			1
@entity0 appeared to get a boost earlier this week when the @entity10 prosecutor told the court that the defendant should be acquitted because of insufficient evidence			1
@entity10 prosecutor @entity28 's statement conformed with what his office said more than a year ago : that the evidence did n't support the charges			1
but investigative magistrates nevertheless pursued the case to trial , which began two weeks ago			1
investigators alleged that the sex parties , in locations such as @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , stemmed from a prostitution ring , organized from the @entity42 in @entity10			0
@entity0 , who was married to @entity14 tv journalist @entity43 until their divorce in 2013 , has never denied that he took part in the parties			1
but the crux of his defense is that he did not know that prostitutes were involved			0
in testimony last week , he acknowledged that the sexual encounters were organized in such a way that they could fit his agenda , but he denied organizing them or asking anyone else to do so for him			0
" i do n't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever , " he said last week			2
in @entity14 , prostitution is legal , but pimping is not			0

before that scandal erupted , he had been on track to run for the @entity14 presidency -- an election that his @entity78 later won with @entity79 as its candidate			0
the @entity10 prosecutor 's office in late 2013 asked for @entity0 's case to be dismissed , citing a lack of evidence			1
however , the investigating magistrates did not follow its recommendations			2
a judgment in the case could come " within months , " @entity28 's spokeswoman , @entity88 , said tuesday			2
@entity2 's @entity91 contributed to this report .			2
