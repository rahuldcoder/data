a surgeon has been arrested on charges of negligence and attempted culpable homicide in the deaths of a dozen women who had undergone sterilization operations at a mobile clinic in one of @entity10 's poorest states			1
dr. @entity11 , assisted by a team of fellow medical professionals , operated on 83 women in a span of six hours saturday in @entity17 state			1
his arrest is one of several measures authorities have taken in response to the deaths and the resulting public outcry			2
by thursday , authorities had halted all sterilization procedures in the @entity28 district of @entity17 , according to @entity29 , the district 's commissioner			1
six types of drugs -- including certain painkillers and antibiotics -- have been banned			2
@entity11 claimed the women died due to those medications , distributed in a nearby village , rather than the operations themselves			1
while @entity11 is the face of the latest outrage , the nationwide , government - run sterilization program has been going on for decades			1
it 's part of a campaign to curb population growth in @entity10 , a nation of 1.25 billion people , second only to @entity47 in population			0
women get paid ( the women in @entity17 each got 1,400 rupees , or about $ 23 ) to have the operations			0
and doctors are given incentives to do them			0
@entity11 told @entity54 prior to his arrest that local health officials awarded him for the large number of sterilizations he performed			2
but it 's also too often a deadly procedure			0
advocates claim that conditions at such sterilization " camps " are sometimes unsanitary and dangerous			0
@entity11 is being charged for the operations he did saturday			1
a day later , some of the women began vomiting and experiencing severe pain			0
twelve of those died , while scores of others are hospitalized			0
another woman who was operated on monday in another district in @entity17 also died			2
autopsy results expected this week clarity on whether the women died from the surgeries or the drugs they took afterward could come this week , when autopsy results come back , according to @entity80 , chief medical health officer for the area			1
@entity11 has said his team followed all necessary safety procedures			2
whether or not that is true , @entity85 - based @entity84 advocate @entity87 said this is often not the case at mobile sterilization clinics around @entity10			1
she told @entity54 that there 's often no electricity , no running water and too few medical staff			0
" it was almost inevitable , " @entity87 said of the recent deaths , " given the unsafe , unethical and unhygienic conditions that persist throughout @entity10 in these camps			0
" @entity11 said the government pressures doctors to perform more and more sterilization surgeries			1
yet , with 83 in six hours , he might have gone too far			0
government guidelines stipulate doctors should conduct no more than 30 sterilization surgeries a day .			1
