reports that @entity1 warplanes carried out a cross-border attack on @entity4 towns this week is further evidence of the blurring between the two countries ' borders as they face an offensive by @entity12 extremists			1
at least 57 @entity4 civilians were killed and more than 120 others were wounded by what local officials say were @entity1 warplanes that struck several border areas of @entity19 province tuesday			1
these border cities are among those under the control of the @entity23 in @entity4 and @entity1 , or @entity24 , which seeks to create an @entity12 caliphate that encompasses portions of @entity4 in @entity1			1
@entity27 : how to understand the crisis reports of the @entity1 incursion into @entity4 is a reminder that the civil war in @entity1 and the unrest in @entity4 are not isolated , but linked in ways that threaten the security of both			1
@entity37 , head of @entity4 's @entity19 provincial council , told @entity39 that tuesday 's air attacks struck markets and fuel stations in areas such as @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			1
" unfortunately , ( the ) @entity1 regime carried out barbarian attacks against civilians in @entity19 province , " he said wednesday			2
@entity37 said he was certain the warplanes were @entity1 because they bore the image of the @entity1 flag			1
" also , the planes flew directly from @entity1 airspace and went back to @entity1 , " he said			1
local officials said residents used scopes and other equipment to see details on the warplanes			2
@entity4 's military spokesman , maj. gen. @entity62 , denied reports that @entity1 warplanes struck inside @entity4 's border towns			1
" we know our airspace			0
we have not recorded or registered infiltration of our air space from foreign jets , and all the warplanes and helicopters flying over @entity4 airspace are @entity4 , " he told @entity39			1
the head of the @entity76 , @entity77 , told reporters wednesday that the warplanes that bombed the @entity4 cities were not @entity4 jets , but he did not have information beyond that			1
@entity1 state media called the reports of a cross-border incursion " completely baseless " allegations made by " malicious media outlets , " citing a " @entity1 media source			2
" @entity39 is seeking a response from the @entity1 government in @entity92			1
@entity4 's border region has been targeted by @entity1 in the past -- as the @entity1 conflict escalated in 2012 , there was at least one instance where rockets fired from @entity1 landed in @entity46			1
@entity4 's @entity99 said at the time that it was ready to respond in the event of additional attacks from @entity1 , but the @entity4 government was noticeably quiet after tuesday 's incursion			1
the claims come as @entity4 forces continue fighting radical @entity107 militants from @entity24			1
inside @entity1 , the government , for the most part , appears to have avoided directly targeting @entity24 , even though the group 's positions are well known			1
only in the last week did the @entity1 regime intensify strikes on @entity114 , a city in @entity1 's interior that is considered @entity24 's headquarters			2
warplanes carried out seven raids on @entity114 on wednesday , killing at least 12 people , including a woman and child , the opposition @entity118 said			0
whether the strikes signify a concerted effort by @entity1 to intensify its fight against @entity24 is yet to be seen			2
it is also unclear whether the @entity1 strikes in @entity4 were a unilateral action or were coordinated with the @entity4 government			1
@entity130 slams @entity107 the sectarian rift in @entity4 may have widened wednesday when @entity4 prime minister @entity130 blamed his political rivals for " coordinating " the crisis			1
@entity130 , a @entity134 , accused @entity107 of collaborating with militants and slammed the call to have a national salvation government that would remove him from power			1
" @entity4 is facing a cross-border terrorist attack that is supported by some neighboring countries , " @entity130 said in a televised speech			0
he appealed to his @entity134 constituency by saying he is adhering to the wishes of @entity134 religious leader @entity144 , who called for volunteers to support the @entity4 army and government			2
@entity149 secretary of state @entity148 downplayed @entity130 's rejection of a salvation government , saying it was n't something the @entity149 had talked to him about specifically			1
to the contrary , he said @entity130 , is committed to the electoral process and creation of a new government that the @entity149 has supported			2
" and he committed to moving forward with the constitutional processes of government formation , and that is precisely what the @entity149 was encouraging , " @entity148 said			2
" he also called on all @entity4 to put aside their differences , to unite in their efforts against terrorism			0
" meanwhile , a @entity149 official told @entity39 that @entity166 is flying surveillance drones over @entity4			1
it 's not known from where they are being launched			0
@entity166 is believed to be providing small arms and ammunition to @entity4 , as well as providing intelligence to @entity130 's government , the official said			1
is @entity175 ready for an @entity24 attack ? meanwhile , on the outskirts of @entity175 , the eerie emptiness of a major highway raises questions about whether the capital would be prepared for a militant invasion			0
the @entity4 military insists it 's ready to beat back isis if the fighters reach @entity175			0
a post-battle video purportedly shows army forces celebrating a victory over @entity24 just west of @entity175			0
the bodies of two militants are draped over the hood of a humvee			0
" look at those @entity24 ! we killed them ! " one man says in the video			0
but the opponents are formidable			0
@entity24 fighters have captured cities and towns across @entity4 in its effort to create an @entity12 state			2
and the highway from @entity175 to @entity203 in @entity19 province showed few signs of readiness for @entity24			0
no tanks or big guns could be seen , @entity39 's @entity207 said			0
what used to be a thriving roadside marketplace now looks like a deserted wasteland			0
it 's unclear what lies farther down the highway , but images on the @entity217 suggest a dire situation			0
photos posted by @entity24 show two soldiers sitting cross-legged on the ground , guns pointed at their heads			0
at least six civilians were killed and 21 wounded wednesday when an @entity4 military helicopter fired two rockets on a mosque and nearby house in central @entity229 , in @entity19 province , according to police and health officials			0
most of the injured were children , who were attending a course on the @entity235 inside the targeted mosque , the officials said			0
at least 12 people were killed and 46 others were wounded when a suicide bomber exploded in a popular coffee shop in @entity241 , south of @entity175 , followed by several mortar rounds attacked several locations nearby			0
at least four people were killed and 11 others were wounded when a car bomb exploded in an outdoor market in @entity250 in northern @entity245 , police officials in @entity245 told @entity39			0
who has what ? maj. gen @entity62 said security forces had regained control of two key border crossings after briefly losing them to the militants			0
@entity62 said @entity4 forces , aided by @entity107 tribes , retook @entity45 , which connects @entity4 with @entity1			1
he also said @entity4 forces regained the @entity262 border crossing between @entity4 and @entity263			2
he also said that all towns between @entity266 and @entity175 , 80 miles ( 129 kilometers ) to the south , are in the hands of @entity4 security forces			2
but large swaths of @entity4 , particularly in the north and west , have fallen from government control to the hands of @entity24			2
@entity149 officials say they think @entity24 now has as many as 10,000 fighters in @entity4 and @entity1			1
but is unknown , officials say , exactly how many are in @entity4 because it 's not clear how many go back and forth across the @entity1 border and how many loyalists have joined @entity24 as it has taken over various towns			1
the spread of @entity24 @entity263 foreign minister @entity281 said he fears the strength of radical militants could spill further across borders			0
" we 've been saying for a while that the rise and spread of extremism and the politics of exclusivity will threaten the security of the entire region , " @entity281 told @entity39 's @entity285			0
" the root cause of ethnic and sectarian division , the root cause of instability and the rise and spread of terrorism and extremism has to be addressed			0
