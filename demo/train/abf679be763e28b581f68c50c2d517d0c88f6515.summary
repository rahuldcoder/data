-- it 's that time in the presidential cycle again			1
@entity3 , presumptive @entity4 nominee , appoints a trusted adviser to lead his vice presidential search			1
the questionnaires are readied ; the real level of interest of the contenders is gauged ( and all public protestations of noninterest dutifully disregarded			0
) the candidate 's weaknesses are cataloged , both in battleground states and in key demographics			1
and maybe the candidate weighs in with a guideline or two for the search			0
this time around , it 's clear what one rule will be : the vice presidential nominee needs to be qualified to be president			1
just ask @entity25 , @entity26 's former campaign manager ( now played by @entity27 in @entity29 's " @entity28 " ) , about that teensy detail that was , er , overlooked in the @entity32 pick			1
" the reality of this process going forward is that @entity3 will run a very tight , very disciplined , very focused search process which will result in someone indisputably prepared to be president of the @entity39 , " he tells me			1
further elaboration ? um , unnecessary			0
@entity0 poll : republicans divided on @entity3 vp choice it 's worth mentioning that the @entity3 campaign faces some of the deficits that plagued @entity26 : a gender gulch and a lack of enthusiasm among much of the very conservative base			1
so it would be easy to pull a @entity32 , circa 2012 -- that is , look for an appealing , conservative female pol to excite the unexcited			2
except that it wo n't -- and should n't -- happen that way			0
one reason : because @entity32 happened that way			2
another reason : the @entity3 campaign ( and its candidate ) are a different breed from @entity62			1
" there 's a very different culture , " says another @entity26 alum			1
" @entity3 is analytical , data - driven and risk averse			2
@entity26 was the opposite of all of those things			2
" think fearless fighter pilot in the cockpit versus a man at home in a conference room with spreadsheets			0
and while the situations are somewhat similar , there are also some key differences in the political environment : it 's not as bad for @entity4 in 2012 as it was in 2008			2
the country had @entity83 fatigue ; @entity26 was seen as offering a @entity83 third term			0
there was a massive fundraising deficit , which wo n't be the case this time around			0
and the @entity26 campaign culture itself was chaotic and often dysfunctional -- not so with the @entity3 folks			1
the @entity3 search is being led by @entity92 , a longtime adviser who some believe channels @entity3 as well as anyone			0
she 's thorough and understands what the candidate is looking for , and who would make him comfortable			0
she and @entity3 also understand the process from the other end since he was vetted by @entity26 four years ago			1
most of all , of course , there is the obvious lesson learned from @entity32 : that the vice presidential pick needs to have a pre-existing base of expertise on a variety of issues			1
one of the many mistakes the @entity26 people have admitted is that they assumed that a sitting governor , by virtue of her position , would be up to the task of answering substantive questions of vital interest to the nation			0
" it 's the threshold , " says one former @entity26 adviser			1
well , at least it is now			0
sure , @entity3 will want a running mate who balances his weaknesses with conservatives and maybe can lend a hand in a key state or two			2
but @entity126 , the vice presidential nominee needs to be one thing more than anything else : competent , prepared and ready to lead			1
@entity26 's credibility went down the tubes when the 72 - year - old candidate offered the slogan " @entity133 , " and then picked @entity32 as his potential successor			1
@entity26 chose the @entity135 ; that 's who he is			2
@entity3 wo n't do that			0
his choice will be more staid and more subdued -- and someone he knows he can work with across that conference table			0
that might not be exciting , but it would be authentic			0
which is exactly what @entity3 needs to be			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			0

@entity3 has begun the process of picking a vice presidential candidate
@entity148 : @entity3 will apply one key lesson of @entity26 's @entity32 pick
@entity148 says whoever is chosen needs to be prepared to be president of the @entity39
