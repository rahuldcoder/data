@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 joined @entity4 and @entity5 in the semifinals of @entity7 with a 3 - 1 upset win over the @entity9 after extra time in @entity0 on saturday night			1
@entity11 scored the @entity13 opener in @entity0			2
goals in the second half of added time from substitute @entity17 and the magical @entity18 capped a triumphant night for the @entity13			1
@entity11 put @entity20 's men ahead in the the 56th minute and they looked to be going through in normal time until @entity22 stole an 86th minute equalizer for the @entity24			1
@entity20 's men will face either @entity26 or @entity27 in the last four after confounding the form book to put out the @entity24			1
@entity30 's team had gone into the quarterfinal match off the back of three convincing victories , but failed to reproduce their captivating football of the group stages and could have no complaints about the outcome			2
@entity38 had said he would be considered a trator if he masterminded their downfall but paid compliments to his team who have been transformed since a 4 - 1 defeat to @entity27 in their opening match			1
" i do n't know how far we have come since our preparation for the first match but usually the @entity24 are a team who one can not outdo tactically , technically or physically , but we did on all three counts , " @entity20 told @entity48			2
" of course we realised we could n't give away too many freekicks to them but as you get tired you tend to commit more fouls			0
" however , my players responded really well and instead of relying on the counterattack they pressed for the winning goal			0
" @entity3 were the more enterprising side from the start at the @entity64 and striker @entity11 headed over when unmarked from an @entity67 cross			1
the @entity24 may not have been producing the free flowing football of their qualifying group but offered a threat at set pieces with @entity73 producing a curling effort from the right which @entity22 should have converted			0
both sides were relying on the counter attack in a cagey tactical affair and just after the half hour mark a classic @entity13 break saw @entity18 bear down on the @entity24 goal to send in a low curler which @entity83 tipped around the post			0
@entity85 keeper van der @entity83 had to use all his near two meter height to tip over a thunderous effort from defender @entity88 from the ensuing corner			0
moments later @entity88 sent in another long range effort from fully 40 meters which nearly dipped under the crossbar			0
@entity22 was generally kept quiet in the first half but his sharp turn and shot from the right had to be neatly saved by @entity97 while @entity88 nearly handed the @entity24 the opener near half - time as his sloppy pass found van der @entity73 who shot straight at the @entity13 keeper			1
the second half was 11 minutes old when @entity18 found @entity103 whose cross from the right was neatly turned in by @entity11			1
the @entity24 keeper then had to be alert to keep out @entity11 for a second goal and @entity3 looked to be holding on for victory until @entity22 struck in typical style with five minutes remaining			1
his tireless @entity111 teammate @entity110 swung in a free kick from the left which the striker converted from close range at the far post			0
extra time again saw the @entity13 pressing with the most menace and in the first period @entity11 hit the crossbar with a snap shot			1
the @entity13 kept pouring forward against a tiring @entity24 side and @entity18 escaped down the left to send over a teasing cross which @entity17 turned in at the far post			2
@entity18 fittingly sealed victory as he received the ball from a throw - in and somehow beat van der @entity83 at the near post			2
" we did n't play football , and never got into the game , " @entity30 admitted after the final whistle			0
" normally we should have been in better shape than the @entity13			0
we did n't see that , " he told the @entity134 .			0

@entity3 beat @entity9 3 - 1 after extra time in @entity7 quarterfinal
@entity17 and @entity18 score winning goals in added time
@entity11 put @entity3 ahead with @entity22 equalizing
