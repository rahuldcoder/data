@entity0 , @entity1 -- the deep - rooted @entity1 tradition of bullfighting is under fire in @entity0 and its region of @entity7 , where the regional parliament will vote on wednesday whether to ban the fights			1
if approved , @entity7 would become the first region in mainland @entity1 to outlaw bullfighting , and some see it as a slap in the face to the rest of the country			1
@entity17 , 24 , laments that he might be the last @entity0 - born bullfighter to take the " alternativa , " or ceremonial fight in the ring against the biggest bulls to become a full - fledged matador , which he did last year at @entity0 's sole remaining bullring , the @entity22			1
@entity17 's father worked at the bullring , opening the doors for bulls to charge in to face matadors and their death			0
" my father brought me to see the bullfights when i still had a pacifier , " @entity17 said			2
" it would be frustrating not to be able to give to my children what my parents gave to me			0
" but activist @entity38 , of the @entity39 , known as @entity40 , looks beyond the tradition and sees animal cruelty			0
she says she 's attended just one bullfight in her life , and that was only to get a sense of the bull 's suffering , which she depicted in a painting that hangs in her living room			2
" bullfighting is part of @entity1 culture , " @entity38 said			2
" but that should change			0
many traditions disappear as the society advances			1
" the number of bullfights across @entity1 has dropped by one - third in recent years , due mostly to budget constraints of local governments , which often fund the spectacles			1
in @entity7 , there are now just over a dozen fights a year and the @entity22 bullring in @entity0 is about the only place in the region that still holds fights			1
but @entity67 and his pro-bullfight group , known as @entity69 , released a study predicting big economic losses for @entity7 if bullfighting is banned			1
this would mainly result , he says , because the @entity75 government would have to pay damages to the bullfighting industry , which holds long - term operating licenses			0
" when the @entity75 government and the opposition are working hard to trim the budget , how could they justify making big indemnity payments to the bullfighting industry , when it 's not necessary , " @entity67 said			0
but critics disagree , saying the economic impact would be minimal , given the small number of fights still held in @entity7			1
either way , the @entity75 parliament bullfight vote is being watched not only in @entity1 , but abroad , where many have a fascination with bullfighting			2
the proposal to ban bullfighting started as a popular initiative in @entity7 and was accepted for consideration by parliament last year by a slim margin of votes			1
since then , there has been an ever - intensifying debate , with bullfighting proponents and opponents gathering support from across @entity1 , even from abroad			2
most analysts predict that the vote on wednesday will be very close			0
the two largest parties in parliament , the ruling @entity107 and the opposition @entity75 nationalists , or @entity111 , have given their members of parliament freedom to vote their conscience			0
some smaller parties on the left are expected to vote for the ban while the conservative @entity118 is expected to support continuing the tradition			0
the ban , if approved , would take effect in january 2012 and would not end bullfighting in the rest of @entity1			2
it still has a strong following in @entity124 and in the south around @entity126			0
@entity1 's @entity127 in the @entity128 already does not allow bullfighting , but a ban in @entity7 would be considered a bigger blow to the tradition			1
some analysts say that @entity75 nationalism , including the desire by some in the @entity0 area for independence from @entity1 , also is playing a role in the vote , as well as the upcoming regional elections for parliament later this year			1
but the main bullfighting proponents and opponents say the root issue is a clear line in the sand : tradition vs. protection of animals			0
the @entity75 parliament vote is expected by 1 p.m. ( 7 a.m. et ) wednesday .			0

@entity7 would become the first region of mainland @entity1 to ban bullfights
only one bullfight ring remains in @entity0 , with about a dozen fights a year
" many traditions disappear as the society advances , " ban *backer* says
economic impact would be painful , bullfight *booster* argues
