-- @entity2 's new @entity1 is n't a phone			1
it 's a shopping mall			2
not that boring shopping mall slowly dying on the edges of suburban @entity14 , but a gorgeous mall with infinite selection and endless opportunities for entertainment , from books to movies and everything in between			0
the price starts at $ 199 with a two - year contract , or $ 649 without a contract			0
the @entity1 may well give its competitors a run for the money			2
malls are social spaces , and so is @entity1			2
its five cameras and assorted sensors are exactly what is needed to create immersive interactive experience			0
and what better thing to socialize around than using it to identify new products , deals and scoops ? the only piece missing from @entity2 's new mall is food , but you can be sure that soon , there will be an @entity38 truck waiting around the corner or an @entity2 aerial drone hovering just over the horizon ready to deliver your order			1
@entity2 is pretty late to the mobile space , and if @entity1 was just another well - designed mobile device , it would n't have a prayer of catching up to @entity47 or @entity48			1
but @entity2 is n't playing catch - up , it 's changing the game by shifting the focus of mobile devices to what it does best : satisfying our seemingly endless desire to buy stuff			1
@entity48 is still struggling with creating a shopping strategy for physical products , and @entity47 is little more than an elegant specialty store in cyberspace			0
in contrast , @entity2 pioneered online shopping and has reinvented the shopping experience time and again			1
fire phone is just the latest chapter in that long history			1
a crucial feature in the fire phone is @entity2 's @entity71 technology , which turns the phone into a one - touch information source for anything that can be viewed with the phone 's many cameras			1
you see a cool jacket on an actor in a movie -- capture the image and @entity2 will find it for sale			2
if you hear a song you like , grab a sample and @entity2 will tell you the artist and offer to sell you a copy			2
or , next time you are at your favorite suburban mall , snap a picture of a product in a physical store and @entity2 will offer it to you for less			2
this may be the most diabolically disruptive aspect of the @entity1			2
while @entity47 and other companies are building out physical stores at great cost as part of their shopping strategy , @entity71 allows @entity2 to invade every store in every mall on the planet and turn it into a de facto showroom for @entity2			1
this will drive retailers crazy			0
expect to hear much about how @entity1 is going to kill physical shopping in the days to come			1
i would n't be surprised if some stores attempt to ban @entity1 entirely			1
once upon a time shopping was mainly " bricks - and - mortar : " an exclusively physical retail experience			0
after @entity2 appeared on the @entity114 , shopping evolved to " bricks - and - clicks : " an expanded shopping reality that provided shoppers the option of visiting either a physical space or a virtual space			1
doomsayers proclaimed the end of physical stores , but while online shopping has been profoundly disruptive , the physical shopping experience evolved to coexist with shopping in cyberspace			0
we are now moving from " bricks - and - clicks " to " bricks - in - clicks : " a world where the line between physical and virtual not only blurs , but becomes a two - way conversation			0
getting competitive pricing with your phone camera is just the start			0
the next phase will be " augmented reality " shopping			1
want to see if that elegant lounge chair really fits in your living room ? select your chair , hit a button and it appears on your screen as if it were actually in your room			0
you can even walk around the chair , viewing it from multiple perspectives			0
sounds futuristic , but @entity152 and @entity154 users can experience this today with apps like @entity157			0
with five cameras and multiple sensors , @entity1 will be able to do this with even greater fidelity			0
@entity2 's @entity1 is being released at a moment when we are seeing the rapid growth of the so - called " @entity165 , " where billions of physical objects from toothbrushes to satellite sensors are being connected to the @entity169			1
before long , shoppers wandering into a physical store wo n't use their phones to merely take a picture of an object ; they will have a phone - mediated conversation with that object			1
and when that happens , @entity178 will probably reinvent things again .			0

@entity182 : @entity2 is n't playing catch - up , it 's changing the game in mobile space
@entity182 : fire phone shifts focus of mobile devices to satisfying our shopping urges
he says features of @entity1 will turn stores into de facto showrooms for @entity2
@entity182 : get ready , the next phase will be " augmented reality " shopping
