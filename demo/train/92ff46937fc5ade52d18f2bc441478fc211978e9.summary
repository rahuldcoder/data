-- for those who 've resolved to only spend their tourist cash in up - and - coming destinations with strong environmental and human rights records in 2014 , nonprofit @entity1 has taken care of the research for you			1
every year , the @entity11 - based team reviews policies and practices in the developing world , then selects the 10 countries that are doing the most to promote human rights , preserve their environments and support social welfare -- all while creating a lively , community - based tourism industry			1
" by visiting these countries , we use our economic leverage as travelers to support best practices , " says @entity19			1
in alphabetical order , the 2014 top 10 are : 1			0
@entity36 " once again , no @entity38 country qualified for our list , " says @entity19			1
" the human rights and environmental records of these nations continued to be found wanting			1
equally unfortunate is that no continental @entity45 country made it onto our 2014 list ; @entity48 was removed because of its declining human rights record this year			1
" choosing the top 10 @entity1 's research focuses on three categories : environmental protection , social welfare and human rights			1
" for each of these categories we look at information past and present so that we understand not only the current state of a country , but how it has changed over time , " says @entity19			2
" this helps us select nations that are actively improving the state of their people , government and environment			0
" information sources include @entity70 , the @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , glbt resources and the @entity75			0
" after identifying about two dozen ' short list ' performers , we turn to detailed case research , focusing on actions these governments have taken over the year to improve ( or in some cases , weaken ) practices and circumstances in the countries , " says the report			1
the list has to have something to offer tourists			0
each " best ethical destination " offers opportunities to check out incredible natural beauty and interactions with local people and cultures in a meaningful , mutually enriching way , says @entity1			2
researchers stressed that just because these destinations made the list , none scored perfect marks			2
" this year , the most prevalent bottleneck issues were the treatment of indigenous populations and of gay citizens , " says the report			0
" in particular , @entity30 and @entity31 need to increase their efforts to respect the rights of their indigenous citizens			0
" criticisms include outdated laws criminalizing homosexuality , which are on the books in some of this year 's countries , including @entity28 , @entity31 and @entity34			0
" however , anti-homosexual laws are laxly enforced in these countries , " says @entity19			2
" in @entity31 , rights groups feel encouraged that the country has started a dialogue on this issue and , while homosexuality is still illegal in @entity34 , recent steps point to positive change			0
when considering these countries for inclusion in the 2015 list , progress on this issue will receive our attention			2
