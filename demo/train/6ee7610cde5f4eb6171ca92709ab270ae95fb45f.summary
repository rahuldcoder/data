@entity0 , @entity1 -- a blurry @entity4 signal stirs to life			1
from a battlefront in northwest @entity9 a @entity7 jihadi fighter has a message for the mother of his childhood friend			1
" i 'd like to say to her that her son was a very loved person			2
we called him " @entity17 " and that means friend			2
he was everybody 's friend , " 20 - year - old @entity20 told @entity2			1
" @entity17 wrote a will and videoed a message for his mother on his mobile phone			2
he said to me ' if i get killed make sure you send this to my @entity28			2
' but the phone was destroyed in the airstrike , " he added			2
" @entity35 " was the nom - de - guerre of @entity32 , a 19 - year - old from @entity0 , a picturesque seaside resort in southern @entity1			1
he was killed in @entity9 's @entity37 province on september 23 as the @entity38 unleashed a first wave of missile strikes on suspected " terrorist " positions			1
the @entity38 and its coalition partners said they were primarily targeting @entity45			2
@entity46 says the targets it hit in @entity37 belonged to a hardcore @entity50 cell known as the " @entity51			0
" @entity20 , however , said his friend @entity32 was , like him , a gunman in the @entity50 - affiliated @entity53 -- a rebel faction battling the @entity9 regime but also designated a " terrorist " organization by the @entity38 news of @entity32 's death was just the latest chapter in the tale of four @entity0 youngsters , who , fresh out of school , headed to war			1
@entity20 , now 20 , is the eldest of four @entity0 youths known to have gone to fight in @entity9			1
he left a year ago after completing business studies at a college in @entity0			1
he told his father was going to do aid work for displaced civilians			2
@entity4 he told me a different story			2
he said he had been inspired by a primetime documentary on @entity7 's @entity74 television about @entity7 and @entity76 recruits taking up arms in @entity9 's civil war			1
@entity20 explained he thought it was his duty to do his bit in @entity9 -- part " help thy neighbor , " part @entity83 obligation to go to the rescue of other @entity85 in need			1
" the @entity85 nation is one body , " he said			0
" if one part is in harm then all the other parts go to rescue			0
it does n't make much sense to me that people are being attacked and you sit at home and do nothing			0
have the morals of life reached such a point that you only care for yourself ? " three months later , apparently inspired by their elder brother 's example , his two younger brothers , @entity107 then 18 and @entity106 , 17 , headed out to join him			1
all joined the ranks of @entity53			0
the @entity112 were born and bred in @entity7			1
@entity32 fled battle - torn @entity113 with his mother when he was aged just five			2
he came to @entity7 after several years in @entity115			1
the @entity112 and @entity32 were longstanding school friends			0
before he left for @entity9 , @entity32 , 19 , was studying computer science			1
his mother @entity117 told @entity2 that @entity32 , the eldest of her four sons , never had any problems with police and regularly helped her in the charity store she ran to raise funds to build schools in her native @entity113			1
@entity117 said her son was infuriated by what he saw as lack of international action to alleviate the suffering of civilians in the @entity9 civil war			1
but he never told her he intended going there			2
" @entity32 called me on february 2 and said ' mum i 'm in @entity9 '			1
i just turned the phone off			0
when he called me again i said ' do n't call me again			0
' i was really angry , " said @entity133 as she sat in her @entity0 home			1
" it was n't just that i was angry with him			0
i just could n't stand that my kid went to such a dangerous place			0
i did n't want to face it , " she added as she sobbed into her headscarf			0
she says she reported her son 's trip to @entity0 police but officers said they could not help coax him back			1
@entity7 counter-terrorism police declined to discuss details of @entity32 's case			1
further checks revealed @entity32 , who did not have his own valid travel papers , had stolen his 15 - year - old brother @entity150 's passport			2
he reportedly flew from @entity152 with @entity107 and @entity153			0
it is not known what route they took into @entity9			1
@entity133 is flabbergasted that three @entity85 teenagers , including one traveling on a stolen 15 - year - old 's passport , were able to make it out of @entity7 so easily			1
" i could n't save my son			0
he 's already dead and i ca n't even bury him			2
but at least let me get the answer to this			0
how did he travel how did he go through the airport ? " she asked			0
" how can a bunch of kids travel like that and nobody even suspected ? this is n't about a religious thing , it 's about all of us being responsible , " she said			2
the @entity7 government has repeatedly said it will crackdown on what it calls the " flow of foreign fighters " to @entity9			1
but this week , the @entity178 told @entity2 it was the responsibility of individual airlines to check the identity of departing passengers not border police			1
when @entity32 left with the two @entity20 brothers , their father quickly found out and trailed them to @entity187			1
he says he pleaded -- unsuccessfully -- with them to come home			0
" they were very adamant they wanted to catch up with their brother			0
it was very painful , you feel very helpless			0
i told them stick to aid work and humanitarian work , " said @entity196 , speaking to @entity2 at his spacious home on the outskirts of @entity0			1
@entity20 , who rents and develops property , first came to the @entity0 area from @entity204 when he was eight to learn @entity205			1
he came to live in @entity7 as a political refugee when his father , a prominent opposition lawyer , was murdered in jail by the @entity210 regime in 1980			1
@entity20 had made several trips to take aid to @entity9			1
years earlier he 'd taken aid to @entity214 and @entity215 with @entity217 - led charity workers			0
but his younger sons did not stick closely to his footsteps			0
he found that out with tragic consequences in april			0
@entity107 was killed near the @entity187 border in clashes with @entity9 regime forces			2
then , as last week with @entity32 's death , it fell to the eldest of the @entity0 jihadis @entity20 to report back with the news			1
" @entity20 told me @entity107 advanced into territory of the @entity9 army then a sniper shot him in the chest			1
he fell on the ground and looked at the sky and laughed			0
that 's how his brother describes it , " explained @entity196			2
" you feel he died a good death as a muslim			0
as a martyr , he goes to paradise			0
but at the same time you feel sad for the loss			0
@entity107 was so young , he had so much in front of him , " @entity20 said			1
his grieving may not be over			0
with the launch of @entity38 and coalition airstrikes , the danger in @entity9 is rising			2
now , his son @entity20 says @entity53 is considering an alliance with its one - time rivals @entity45 to confront the @entity38 - led offensive			2
" i very much doubt we will unite as a single group			0
but the scholars of @entity83 have come together to work toward a peace treaty between all groups since they see it 's more beneficial to face the coalition , " @entity20 said			1
he insisted , however , that @entity53 still had serious differences with @entity45 over its brutal tactics , particularly beheading hostages and attacking unarmed civilians			0
as the @entity4 signal with @entity20 began to fade , he offered another detail to try and comfort @entity133 , the mother of his fallen friend			1
" @entity17 ( @entity32 ) is definitely buried in a nice place and he had a good burial , " he said			0
as i visited @entity270 , on a bright end - of - summer day , she seems resigned that she would never be able to bring her son for burial at home			0
so instead she imagines him at peace in some quiet corner , far from the battlefield			0
she tells me : " i think they would have buried him in the mountain			0
and i say to myself , ' do n't worry god is there in the mountains , god is everywhere			0
@entity285 have mercy on you my son			0
