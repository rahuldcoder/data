-- in a sense , @entity1 has a permanent reminder of disgraced cyclist @entity4 etched into his skin			1
but to the 48 - year - old @entity9 resident , the @entity7 bracelet tattooed on his wrist is n't about @entity4 or his long - awaited admission to doping as a professional cyclist			1
it 's a symbol of his father 's struggle with cancer and the bond they shared , @entity1 said			2
moreover , any time he 's tempted to pick up a cigarette , the recovering smoker is reminded of why he stopped in the first place			0
" my decision to get the tattoo had absolutely nothing to do with mr. @entity4 , and subsequently , these revelations do nothing to diminish the meaning it has for me			1
the tattoo was and will always be a symbol of the love that my father and i shared , " @entity1 said in a @entity30			2
" the effect he had on the foundation was huge , but they both should be able to stand on their own			2
the foundation should not be held accountable for his deception			1
" @entity4 admitted this week in an interview with talk show host @entity42 that he used an array of performance - enhancing drugs to win seven @entity47 titles			2
he had denied the drug use for years , often angrily			0
the first of the two - part interview aired thursday night			0
others who have worn the yellow bracelet or supported the cancer charity that @entity4 started in 1997 say @entity54 is now bigger than him			1
as long as people like @entity1 continue to view @entity54 as an entity separate from its fallen founder , the cancer charity will likely withstand whatever controversy befalls @entity4 , charity experts said			1
opinion : a loss for @entity4 , a win for @entity42 " the organization has done a lot to separate itself from @entity4 's image over the years			1
as a result , many people identify it as a cancer organization , which is why it 's not already crumbling , " said @entity67 , editor of the @entity68 , a @entity70 - based news source for the nonprofit world			2
after all , this is n't the first time @entity4 has been mired in controversy in the past decade , and @entity7 is still around			1
since 2004 , when doping allegations against @entity4 first came to light in a book by @entity83 sports journalist @entity82 , the foundation has experienced steady year - to - year revenue growth , according to financial records , with the exception of a dip from 2005 to 2006 , the year @entity4 was cleared of allegations stemming from a 1999 drug test			1
many nonprofits look up to @entity54 as a success model , especially for its social media campaigns , thanks in part to @entity4 's hands - off leadership , @entity67 said			1
he hired a staff of experienced fundraisers with a history of running charities and nonprofits , which can be unusual among celebrity - driven charities , she said			2
" he 's allowed them to go ahead without micromanaging , which some celebrities have a hard time doing , " she said			0
" for foundations started by one person , it can be hard to get past the celebrity because that 's how they 've gotten so big			0
" @entity54 has also built alliances with other organizations to fundraise and raise awareness around positive messaging , she said , which also makes it stand out from other cancer charities			1
in other words , if @entity54 was going to crumble under the mountain of scandals and deception now synonymous with @entity4 , it probably would have happened by now			1
that does n't mean the foundation wo n't face some fallout , but its overall future probably wo n't hinge on @entity4 , she said			1
his decision to step down as chairman and leave the board has helped @entity54 from the controversy and give the impression that the foundation is charting an independent course , @entity67 said			1
" it was one thing when there were a few weeks between him stepping down as chair but still remaining on the board that were questionable , " she said			0
" but now that he 's not on the board , it shows that ( the board ) is trying to become a new generation of the organization			0
" @entity54 has indicated this would be part of its strategy going forward , regardless of what @entity4 revealed to @entity42			1
@entity4 's doping drugs " ... we are charting a strong , independent course forward that is focused on helping people overcome financial , emotional and physical challenges related to cancer , " the @entity152 , @entity151 - based foundation said thursday			1
" inspired by the people with cancer whom we serve , we feel confident and optimistic about the foundation 's future and welcome an end to speculation			2
" that 's not to say the situation has n't provoked a crisis of faith among many @entity7 supporters , especially those who were inspired by @entity4 's accomplishments as a cyclist and cancer survivor			1
@entity172 admired @entity4 and everything he stood for , especially after reading his books , and started wearing the bracelets as soon as they came out in 2004			2
the @entity7 slogan resonated with him after his grandfather and aunt died from cancer , and he decided to get a @entity7 tattoo when he was 20 because he could n't wear the yellow bracelets while playing college sports			1
" @entity7 represents being able to conquer even the toughest of obstacles , including cancer , " he said			2
now , after all that has come out , the tattoo embarrasses him and he is torn over what to do			0
" i still support the @entity7 cause and i am still in awe of what @entity4 was able to do , doping or not , but both the foundation and @entity4 are now tainted , " he said in a @entity30			1
" it is incredible that he won seven tours , but he cheated			0
it 's plain and simple			0
and the fact that after all the cancer he suffered from he would do unnatural things that could harm his body is just something i ca n't fathom			0
" why people cheat before he got his tattoo , @entity1 started wearing the yellow bracelet in 2004 in an effort to scare himself out of smoking			0
then , his father received an abrupt diagnosis of stomach cancer in 2005			0
@entity1 gave him his bracelet when he went into the hospital for surgery related to his stomach cancer			0
the day his father died in 2005 , @entity1 held his hand and slipped the yellow @entity7 bracelet off his wrist and onto his			2
when the bracelet wore out a year later , he got it tattooed onto his wrist			0
the tattoo artist did n't think yellow would wear well and made it red instead , @entity1 said , so people do n't immediately recognize it			0
he has no plans to get rid of it , given all that it means to him			0
as for his father , he had a dry sense of humor , he said			0
" i would like to think he 's chuckling somewhere and smiling about the whole situation			0
