if , as many observers believe , @entity1 wins the @entity3 for best actor on sunday , he will become the first man to win three ( @entity6 has done this ; @entity8 might match her if she wins for her turn in quartet )			1
such an honor would ratify @entity12 ' standing not simply as one of the greatest actors of his time , but for all time			0
like @entity17 , day - @entity1 is seen as the quintessential method actor , a commitment he has taken to extremes in his well - known penchant for embodying his characters even when the cameras are n't rolling			1
day - @entity1 also is notable for the extraordinary breadth of roles he has played			1
he first came to global attention in 1985 when he appeared simultaneously as the priggish @entity27 in the @entity29 film adaptation of @entity31 's 1907 novel " @entity32 " as well as @entity33 , the gay @entity35 punk , in @entity37 ' brilliantly brash " @entity38			0
" but it has been in playing @entity40 where @entity12 has made his most distinctive impact			1
between 1988 and 2007 he played a string of @entity40 figures that ranged from a 17th century @entity45 ( " @entity46 " ) to a contemporary art collector ( the otherwise forgettable " @entity48 " )			2
his turn as the lead character in the 1992 film version of @entity53 's 1825 novel " @entity54 " has become a classic , while his role as the driven oil prospector @entity57 in " @entity57 " won him his second @entity3 for best actor in 2008			1
for all the range of the characters , however , there is a surprising degree of continuity in this gallery of @entity40			2
the quintessential day - @entity1 character is a frontiersman , even when that frontiersman is disguised as a gang member staking out a territory ( " @entity69 " ) , or an iconoclastic @entity71 attorney chafing against social convention ( " @entity73 " ) on the same @entity75 streets			1
day - @entity1 always plays a man apart -- someone at odds with the institutional arrangements that surround him			1
if he is to survive , which in many cases he does not , his protagonists must move to the margins , finding a place on the outskirts of society			0
it 's in this context that one can begin to appreciate how @entity12 's latest @entity3 - nominated performance as @entity90 breaks fresh ground			1
for the first time , he 's not playing an estranged outsider , but rather a man at the epicenter of his society , exercising the levers of power to -- successfully -- bend a system toward his will			2
and that will is not of a personal and / or self - destructive variety ; instead , it 's a collective moral vision codified in a 13th amendment to the @entity104 to end slavery			2
the novelty of the performance does n't end there			0
we all know about figures who attain greatness in public life but whose private lives are a mess , repellent , or both			0
@entity90 has rarely been portrayed as a tyrant ( except by die - hard @entity120 ) , but often as inscrutable			0
but more than any other actor , even @entity124 's folksy " @entity123 " ( 1939 ) , day - @entity1 ' version seems like a likable , three - dimensional human being			1
he seems equally at ease chatting with troops , black and white , as he is in spinning a yarn for his @entity128			0
he argues with his wife and son to the point of losing his temper ( there 's a memorable slap at @entity135 , played by @entity136 )			0
much has been made of @entity12 ' rendition of @entity90 's voice , free of the stentorian tones one might expect of a man of his literal or figurative stature ; contemporaries reported it as high and reedy , which is how the actor renders it here			1
this @entity147 is a man of moderation			2
though clearly trying to lead public opinion in the face of significant political opposition , he 's no radical ; his foil in the film is rep. @entity155 ( @entity156 ) who indeed was part of a @entity160 - party faction impatient with @entity90 's pace on emancipation			2
@entity155 is portrayed far more kindly in " @entity147 " than he was almost a century ago as the villain of @entity165 's 1915 epic " @entity166 , " but the film ultimately affirms @entity90 's recognition that compromise ( including possible moral compromise ) is an indispensable element of statecraft			1
yet for all the novelty of this performance , the role is of a piece with @entity12 ' larger body of work			0
for while his @entity90 is far more integrated into the fabric of his society than any of his other characters , he remains a man who struggles against a sense of isolation , whether personal or political , amid the maelstrom			0
unable to escape the fierce hatreds that rage around him , he becomes a casualty in a war he is determined to prosecute toward a just end			0
the truest @entity40 , @entity12 seems to be telling us , are those who can never be fully at home in the world : our collective character is a restless one			1
it 's an insight with which @entity12 may make some history of his own .			0

@entity198 : if @entity1 wins best actor award at the @entity3 , it will be a record
@entity198 : day - @entity1 has made the most impact by playing @entity40 , notably frontiersmen
he says the actor 's version of @entity147 seems like a likable , three - dimensional human being
@entity198 : day - @entity1 seems to be telling us that the truest @entity40 are the restless ones
