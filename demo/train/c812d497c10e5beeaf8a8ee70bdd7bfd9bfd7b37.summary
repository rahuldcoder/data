@entity0 -- old mental health records for the chief suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks suggest @entity5 should have been prevented from holding a job at a @entity8 research facility in @entity9 , according to a report from a panel of behavioral experts commissioned by the @entity13			1
" the psychiatric records were quite eye - opening , " said @entity14 , the lead author of the report			2
" the criminal behaviors involved a strong component of revenge , " he added , " that he claimed he had engaged in as well as planned to engage in " in documented interviews with psychiatrists dating back to the 1970s			2
@entity5 was accused by the @entity24 of allegedly being behind the mailings of anthrax that killed five people in 2001			1
@entity5 , who knew he was under suspicion , committed suicide in 2008 before any charges were filed against him			1
the report " does support the @entity13 's determination that he was responsible , " including that he had the capacity , the opportunity and the motivation to carry out the attacks			0
his psychiatric records apparently were not reviewed in 1980 by the @entity39 when it granted security clearances that led to his being hired as a government microbiologist , the report says			2
but it was n't because of privacy law that his problems were not immediately brought to light			0
" he had signed waivers prior to his employment that his records could be made available , " @entity14 said , " but to our knowledge those records were never accessed			0
" authorities looking for a suspect in the anthrax mailings also missed the troubled picture of mental health			2
" this information had been deemed confidential during dr. @entity5 ' lifetime , " @entity14 noted , " accessible only to his medical providers , and off - limits to investigators " looking into the deadly anthrax case			1
moreover , based on its findings , the report says @entity5 was able to omit and distort details of his mental health throughout his career at @entity70 , @entity9 , " in a manner that enabled him to evade real scrutiny			1
" the pattern continued through 2008 , when " he was displaying behaviors that were of great concern , " @entity14 said , but were not acted upon by @entity5 ' supervisors			1
outwardly , " @entity5 projected a persona of benign eccentricity , " a summary says , but " portrayed himself as a far more dangerous person " in meetings with a psychiatrist about a year before he was hired , the summary says			1
the report , entitled " @entity88 , " was released wednesday through the @entity89 , a nonprofit think tank based in @entity91 , @entity92			0
at a briefing for reporters in @entity0 , one of the co-authors , @entity97 , a medical doctor with a specialty in psychiatry , said " there 've been vast improvements , " in the process of checking someone 's background for jobs in national security and critical materials			2
but , he said , when a person has received counseling for mental health issues , it 's up to the provider to know what importance to place on disclosure of their analysis			0
@entity97 said as part of a background check , " if you speak to treating clinicians and say that this person 's job involves national security issues , involves a clearance , involves working with dangerous agents , @entity119 ( weapons of mass destruction ) , you 'll get a different level of response			1
" the report includes a list of personnel security recommendations based on what it called the " extraordinary " anthrax case			0
the report , completed in august , took five months to prepare in response to a request by the @entity140 @entity13			0
probing into otherwise confidential medical records was authorized by a sealed order in 2009 from @entity140 @entity144 chief judge @entity143			0
the report had remained under seal until this month , and only a redacted version was revealed wednesday			0
censored details include information that could identify friends , co-workers and mental health professionals who encountered and counseled @entity5 during his career			1
last month , the @entity155 issued a report and concluded that using the available scientific evidence " it is not possible to reach a definitive conclusion " about the source of the anthrax used in the 2001 anthrax letter attacks			2
the panel said the anthrax used in mailings was the @entity166 strain bacillus anthracis , and spores from those letters shared " a number of genetic similarities " with spores in @entity5 ' flask			1
but the findings say the @entity24 did not fully explore other possible explanations for those similarities			0
last month , the @entity155 issued a report that supported the @entity24 's scientific basis linking @entity5 to the form of anthrax used in the attacks			1
wednesday 's report noted " dr. @entity5 acknowledged that he was the sole custodian of the " @entity185 " flask that held the anthrax " mailed to targets in the media and @entity188			1
postal workers who handled the contaminated letters were among the 22 people infected			0
there were five fatalities .			0
