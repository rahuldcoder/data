-- wednesday night 's @entity2 summit was , well , a very @entity2 summit			1
it lasted forever , included several dramatic moments , ended in the wee hours of the morning and delivered a highly complex result			0
yet , the questions that @entity7 might now ask are quite simple : has this leaders ' conclave succeeded in stopping the spread of the " contagion " from the eurozone 's sovereign debt crisis ? will the @entity2 financial disease reach @entity7 's shores and affect local jobs and livelihoods ? the answer may seem somewhat paradoxical : while the @entity2 have made strides to beat the virus , this crisis is anything but over			1
the @entity2 had been asked to deploy a " big bazooka , " a weapon so big and so potent that it would force financial markets into submission			1
there could be no doubt allowed that the " euro - @entity2 " ( those who share @entity2 's single currency ) would do absolutely everything to preserve the credibility of their currency and restore trust that investments in @entity2 bonds remain safe			1
in the good old days , a president , a prime minister or a chancellor ( most likely male ) would have stepped up , made a bold decision and presented it to the people in front of a microphone			0
he would appear to be determined and convinced that he was doing the right thing			0
doubt was neither part of his vocabulary nor his demeanor			0
indeed , those were the days of the sovereign nation state			0
but the eurozone is not a sovereign and not a nation			2
instead of a prime minister , it has " @entity59 " -- @entity61 chancellor @entity60 and @entity63 president @entity62 -- an odd couple who , though unelected in their roles , have stepped into a continental leadership vacuum			1
their summit battles with each other and with their 15 colleagues are well - known			1
while the markets want certainty , @entity59 can only deliver measures saddled with national caveats because they must respect other nations ' minority views			2
it is the nature of @entity2 's intergovernmental beast that defies the decisiveness that markets demand			1
given the political constraints and the convoluted nature of the decision - making , @entity59 and friends have certainly delivered			2
the complexity of the challenge in the uncharted territory of a monetary union without joint fiscal authority can not be overstated			0
@entity59 have lightened the debt load of @entity93 considerably by talking the banks into a loss of 50 % on the face value of their @entity93 loans ; they have ring - fenced other weak nations by introducing a recapitalization mechanism for banks ; they have leveraged the existing bailout fund -- the @entity105 -- to a maximum capacity of $ 1.4 trillion ; they have pressured @entity108 into another round of structural and budget reforms ; and they have agreed to improve the governance of the currency union by way of treaty change			1
not bad for a long weekend that ended thursday morning			0
the markets , after initially reacting favorably , will try to poke holes in the carefully constructed edifice			1
the leaders themselves will have given the markets all the cues			1
such is the nature of a consensus body of national leaders that no disagreement and no doubt goes unnoticed , all preparatory documents -- including risk assessments -- have been leaked			2
soon , market participants will focus on the architecture of the leveraged bailout fund and its two new special - purpose vehicles , which will be open to outside investors			2
it is still unknowable whether markets will consider them safe , given that the @entity2 , especially the @entity61 , have insisted on insurance of limited rather than unlimited liability , to guarantee against some of the losses that bondholders might suffer			0
most importantly , the leaders can not control what the banks do next			1
they might seek new capital -- as is suggested to them -- to reach the new core capital requirement of 9 % by next summer			0
but they might also shrink their balance sheets to get there , thus contributing to a credit crunch and economic contraction			0
their participation in the @entity93 " haircut " has been framed as voluntary			1
but in reality , at that level of a write - down , they are more interested in being forced into an agreement that the markets call a credit event			1
such an event triggers an insurance payment to the investors ( an insurance scheme called credit default swap kicks in to minimize bank losses )			0
the @entity2 leaders want to avoid such a situation for risk of contagion			0
it will still be quite a dance to avoid the credit event			0
again , the outcome is unknowable today			0
in the end , markets might find that @entity2 's big bazooka is really mid-sized			1
in fact , the last few days have revealed that the @entity2 firepower is limited			0
@entity63 can not spend much more cash without endangering the country 's triple - a rating			1
if it loses the top rating , the bailout fund will be downgraded as well , thus increasing @entity61 's liability			0
at that point , the whole bailout building will look flimsy			0
therefore , it is time for others to come to the rescue			0
up until now , the @entity7 has resisted increasing the @entity194 's ( and thus also @entity7 's ) financial involvement			1
but @entity196 will need to reconsider , for two reasons of self - interest : the crisis spans the @entity200 , and the two economies are deeply integrated			2
there will be no @entity7 recovery without stabilization in @entity2			2
thursday morning , the @entity63 president talked to the @entity207 premier to convince him to invest in @entity2 's new special - purpose vehicle			2
will @entity7 want to lose its leverage over @entity2 to @entity207 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			1

@entity212 - @entity212 says deal in *emergency* @entity217 summit promising , crisis not over
he says @entity62 , @entity60 faced huge task in uniting eurozone leaders on plan for @entity93
he says the markets are likely to poke holes in deal ; there 's no telling what banks will do next
writer : the @entity7 should come to rescue next and support upping @entity194 's financial involvement
