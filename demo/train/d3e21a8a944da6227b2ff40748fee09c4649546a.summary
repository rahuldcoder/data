-- authors ' voices can resound long after they 're gone			2
for @entity4 , that 's the hardest part of living without her husband , @entity5 -- but it 's also what 's helping her cope with his sudden death			1
readers have his latest book to digest			0
and for his literary team , there is the painful dilemma of what to do with an unpublished manuscript			1
@entity19 was a crime - fiction author whose books have sold more than 2 million copies			1
his latest , " @entity23 of @entity24 , " came out just weeks after he died at 45 from a ruptured aneurysm			1
it 's the fourth in a series of thrillers set in the @entity28 , against the backdrop of the region 's ancient past			2
the idea that " @entity23 of @entity24 " could be his last book is all the more poignant , because reviewers and editors alike say it 's his best -- even @entity4 agreed			1
@entity38 , editorial director at @entity39 , says , " he very rarely blew his own trumpet			0
" but after @entity4 's most recent book was complete , his editor says he changed his tune			1
@entity38 recalls : " he turned to me and said , ' @entity38 , i do think perhaps i 've written quite a good book here			0
' " to which @entity38 replied : " it 's bloody brilliant			2
" promoting a book without an author presents unique challenges -- especially because @entity4 took such an active role in publicizing his work			1
@entity38 remembers @entity4 riding around @entity54 on his motor scooter , with a publicist in tow , on his way to interviews to support his books			1
he joked that the writer terrified his passengers with his driving			0
but @entity4 set himself apart by making time for all of the interview requests that came his way , no matter how small the publication			1
now his book is getting noticed for its author 's absence			1
" in some ironic way , it ( his death ) got a little bit more attention for the book in the @entity82 , " says @entity71 , president of @entity72 , @entity4 's @entity74 publisher , " as people wrote about the tragedy of his death and the fact that this was going to be his last book			1
" his widow did n't finish his latest book until after his death last year			1
reading it now makes her miss him the most			0
" some of the turns of phrases that he uses are so quintessentially @entity5 , " she says			0
" there could n't be anyone else who had written them			0
" she says she yearns to talk to him each time she finds one of the inside jokes he scatters throughout " @entity23 of @entity24			2
" in all of his books , he includes characters named after people he and his wife know			0
" i wish i 'd been able to tell him i 'd spotted them , " she says			0
@entity4 also wove his wife into all of his stories			1
each book includes a character called @entity114 ( @entity4 's full name )			1
his widow was amused to discover the circumstances of her namesake 's appearance in the most recent book			1
the @entity114 figure relieves herself in the @entity122 in @entity123			0
she then makes a gruesome discovery when she loses her footing and falls down a shaft			0
" i think one of the really , really difficult things about losing someone is the conversation ending , " @entity4 says			1
" and the person that you 've been in the most amazing , wonderful conversation with -- suddenly that stops			2
" to keep the dialogue going , his widow writes letters to @entity4			1
she tells him about his two sons , ages 5 and 3 , and what she 's up to around their @entity54 home			2
" all of those things that you would normally talk about , " she says			0
she has a treasure trove of material that she can turn to when she wants to remember his voice			0
in addition to his books , @entity4 kept 25 years ' worth of diaries			2
and there is a book that even his most ardent fans have n't read yet			0
before finding his niche in @entity28 detective thrillers , @entity4 made his first foray into novel writing down quite a different path			1
his agent says she has a manuscript @entity4 wrote more than 10 years ago			1
it 's the story of a 100 - year - old man who decides to kill himself , because he thinks he 's lived long enough			1
in a suicide note , he confesses to 10 murders			0
but readers soon realize that the narrator is n't a murderer at all ; rather , he just failed to prevent accidents			0
along the way , they get a history of the 20th century			0
" it 's an absolutely hilarious book , " says @entity171 , his longtime agent and friend			0
" but it 's painful because we all miss him so much			2
" ( @entity4 and i crossed paths briefly at @entity0 in @entity54 , where he worked about 10 years ago			2
) @entity171 says the unpublished manuscript reflects its author even more than his subsequent novels , largely because it 's so funny			1
but without @entity4 , working on it would be heart - wrenching			1
his literary team also worries that introducing a new work too soon after his latest crime thriller 's release could distract readers from the marketing campaign around his existing books			1
they focus on @entity4 's background as an archaeologist , rather than his modern wit			1
even so , publishing expert @entity193 says she believes the manuscript should be published			0
" if the product exists , you should get it out there , " she says			0
the adjunct associate professor at @entity200 finds plenty of upsides to bringing out new material from an author who has passed away			2
" i think it would be great if ... they can make a few bucks , or if they just want to make sure that the fans are happy , " she says			0
as they mull over sharing his unpublished work with the world , his colleagues and friends find that @entity4 lives on through his books			1
" for me , he 's very much alive , " @entity171 says			0
" as his literary agent , i 'm selling rights around the world			2
" his widow is taking a year off from her job as a documentary producer for the @entity222 in @entity54			2
she is focusing on putting together a book of memories for her sons about their dad			0
she says she would also be keen to publish her husband 's early manuscript -- in time			1
" i want people to hear his voice , " she says			0
for now , his readers can seek solace in @entity4 's current collection			1
" he knew how to tell a rip - roaring story , " says @entity235			0
but more than that , he left his friends and family happy with the time -- and the work -- that they got from him			0
" that 's basically his legacy , " @entity171 says			0
" you would always feel better having spent time with @entity5			0
