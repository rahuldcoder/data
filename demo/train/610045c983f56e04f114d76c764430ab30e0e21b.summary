@entity0 -- speaker @entity2 , @entity3 , indicated wednesday that the @entity5 - controlled @entity4 will not back a resolution sponsored by sen. @entity7 , @entity8 , expressing congressional support for limited @entity11 involvement in the @entity13 - led military campaign in @entity14			1
" i do n't think that 's where the @entity4 is , " @entity2 told reporters on @entity16			1
" the fact is the president has not made his case to the members of @entity23			0
he has not made his case to the @entity11 people			2
" @entity7 's resolution , introduced tuesday along with @entity27 democrat @entity26 , authorizes the commitment of @entity11 forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of @entity11 ground troops			1
@entity7 , the @entity5 's 2008 presidential nominee , said tuesday he believes president @entity36 " did the right thing by intervening ( in @entity14 ) to stop a looming humanitarian disaster			1
" @entity4 leaders are preparing to hold a vote on the @entity7 - @entity26 measure , but are also considering another resolution that would strictly limit @entity11 involvement in @entity14 to a noncombat role			1
@entity4 @entity5 will meet behind closed doors wednesday afternoon to discuss the issue			2
the allied military effort , which already has formal @entity47 support , was launched to protect @entity14 civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by the @entity53 country 's longtime ruler , @entity51			1
@entity55 leaders have made clear , however , that they believe the mission can not be successfully completed without @entity51 's ouster			0
the @entity36 administration has already promised not to use @entity11 ground troops , but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has been mounting			2
an unusual coalition has formed between traditionally anti-war @entity63 and conservative @entity5 worried about the cost of the conflict and skeptical of its national security importance			0
support for the war has also been shaken by evidence presented by @entity51 's government of several noncombatant deaths caused by recent @entity13 airstrikes			2
@entity13 officials admitted over the weekend that aircraft from countries in the alliance had mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the @entity14 opposition			1
in addition , critics contend the administration has violated the 1973 @entity82 , which gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending @entity11 forces to war , followed by a 30 - day extension to end hostilities			2
the combined 90 - day period ended sunday			0
the @entity90 argues the president did n't need congressional authorization because @entity11 forces are playing only a supporting role in @entity14 and have n't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities			1
@entity36 , however , personally overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the @entity97 and the @entity99 's @entity98 , according to a saturday report in the @entity101			0
@entity2 indicated tuesday the @entity4 proposal seeking to limit @entity11 forces to a noncombat role reflects growing frustration over @entity36 's alleged failure to inadequately consult @entity23			1
" if the commander - in - chief believes that intervention in @entity14 is important for our national security , he has a responsibility to make a case for it -- clearly and publicly -- and seek authorization , " the speaker said in a written statement			1
" in the three months since military action in @entity14 began , none of this has occurred			0
... @entity23 has a responsibility to hold the @entity90 accountable			0
" in the @entity124 , however , majority leader @entity120 , @entity121 , and minority leader @entity122 , @entity123 , have resisted holding a vote on the war because of divisions within their respective caucuses			0
@entity120 said tuesday that there is bipartisan support for the @entity7 - @entity26 resolution in the @entity132 , but that he was still in discussion with the two sponsors on when to bring the measure from the panel to the @entity124 floor			1
he indicated it could be brought to the floor as early as this week			0
@entity139 , meanwhile , told reporters that " we all anticipate that there will be some kind of @entity14 debate in the @entity124 in the near future			0
" @entity7 has expressed anger that the @entity90 did n't push for an earlier congressional vote on the war			2
the veteran senator , considered a leading voice on military matters , contends that a resolution of support would have passed easily when @entity13 first intervened			1
" the administration 's disregard for the elected representatives of the @entity11 people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive , " @entity7 said tuesday			1
" the unfortunate result of this failure of leadership is plain to see in the full - scale revolt ... that is occurring in the @entity4			2
" the @entity4 is also planning to take up the 2012 defense spending bill later this week , and liberal rep. @entity164 , @entity165 , intends to propose an amendment cutting off funding for the mission			2
however , that amendment is likely to only come up next month after the @entity4 returns from its @entity171 recess			0
to prevent a similar resolution from @entity164 from passing earlier , @entity2 pushed through a resolution giving the president two weeks to send @entity23 information justifying the @entity11 strategy in @entity14			1
@entity36 responded with a 32 - page report arguing in part that he has not violated the @entity82			0
even if the @entity5 - controlled @entity4 passes measures intended to limit funding for the @entity14 mission , it is unlikely the @entity124 would do the same			1
" the president 's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in @entity14 , but i will be no part of an effort to defund @entity14 or to try to cut off our efforts to bring @entity51 down , " conservative sen. @entity182 , @entity123 - @entity183 , told @entity193 's " @entity192 " on sunday			1
@entity36 " needs to step up his game with @entity14 , but @entity23 should sort of shut up and not empower @entity51 , " @entity182 argued			0
in march , the @entity124 unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution supporting the no - fly zone over @entity14			1
some @entity5 , however , have now expressed opposition to that effort , citing growing concerns about its cost			0
in its report on the mission , the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through june 3 was about $ 800 million			0
it estimated the total cost through september 30 would be $ 1.1 billion			0
questions about the war 's financial and other costs have also been raised in the @entity214 , which has played a leading role in the @entity13 effort			2
@entity214 prime minister @entity217 insists that @entity214 's military involvement in the @entity53 country can continue " as long as we need			0
" @entity1 's @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .			0
