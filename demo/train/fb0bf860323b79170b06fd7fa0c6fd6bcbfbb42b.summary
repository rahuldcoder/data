-- the musician @entity1 is releasing the first ever app - album			1
it 's called " @entity8 , " and it goes on sale in the @entity7 on tuesday			1
the app - album is a collection of games , visualizations and musical scores that accompany @entity1 's songs , which also is available for a traditional audio - only download			1
each song , in effect , becomes its own visual - and - audio experience , letting @entity1 's fans interact with her songs in an entirely new way			1
the main " @entity8 " app is available for free			1
each sub-application , which contains a song and some sort of interactive game , costs 99 - cents , or $ 9.99 for the whole album			1
a non-app version of the album also is available			1
the @entity31 artist is known for being innovative			1
her 2004 album " medulla " was composed almost entirely from human voices , which were remixed into a myriad of sounds			1
on " @entity37 , " she used touch - sensitive instruments that predate the @entity39			2
" apps and @entity39 are just tools -- they have to be human and they have to have soul , " she said			2
@entity1 sat down with @entity0 to talk about the creative process and purpose behind " @entity8			1
" you can listen to a @entity47 podcast of the interview			2
the following is a transcript : @entity0 : how did the idea of creating an app for your album or wanting to make your music interactive first come about ? @entity1 : well , believe it or not , this project started because i wanted to simplify things , and then ended up being one of the most complex things i 've done			1
but the initial idea , in a way , was because of the arrival of the touch screen			2
i was already on my last tour from 2006 to 2008 , the " @entity37 " tour			2
i had a touch screen instrument called the @entity69 and another one called @entity70			2
and i was performing or people who were playing with me in the band were on those			0
once the tour was finished in 2008 , i was excited not just to perform with touch screens , but to write with them or kind of use it as much as you could			0
for me , it tapped into an issue i had as a child and sort of had since			0
@entity0 : even before you started with this project and started developing with these technologies to write these songs in creative ways , what has been your experience with listening to music ? how do you experience music ? is this something you wish had been around before as a way for you to interact with other artists ' music ? @entity1 : that 's a good question , i never really thought about that			1
yeah , for sure ! people obviously tend to be scared of new tools and always think they have no soul in them			0
the reason why there is no soul in them is because no one put it there , like you can not really blame the tool ... obviously technology is so sophisticated now that you ... do n't have to be the biggest programming genius on @entity113 to do it			0
you can do it now in a simple way			0
and i feel if some of my favorite musicians would do something like this , it would obviously be important that they would do something that is idiosyncratic for them			0
that it is not just accessorizing their music just for the novelty factor			0
because tools are just tools and obviously apps and @entity39 are just tools , they have to be human and they have to have soul			0
@entity0 : could you elaborate on the educational workshops that you 'll be doing and why they are important for you ? @entity1 : the core of this project is kind of educational , not only that i want to teach basic musicology for beginners , but it actually ended up being the project that i learned most			1
i feel like i 've been three years in this intense university			0
so that 's really the core of the project			1
it 's hard to say why			1
maybe i 'll look back in 10 years time and say why			0
it felt like the shows are only a part when i 'm obviously singing and expressing myself			0
but it also had to be the other angle where the kids could come and they could express themselves and be interactive			1
so far , we 've gotten offers from some natural history museums and science museums around the planet			0
because it would be nice if it was not just the musical side of things , but also the biological			0
for example , they could come in and they could play with crystals and biologists could tell them about crystals			0
and musicologists could tell them about structures in music			0
then they can get the app to try it out , write their own little songs , and put it on a usb key and take it home			1
that 's the way i think it will work best in the spirit of the project			2
it can not really be without that aspect			0
@entity0 : what do you hope people can get out of this app and this experience of interacting with your music ? @entity1 : for me , obviously , i want to show that there 's connection between nature and music ... it 's kind of an interesting project because i understand it more now that i am doing interviews than when i was doing it -- that the core or idea of this project is taking something that has usually been quite academic or bookish and making it impulsive and tactile			1
so actually explaining it or doing an interview about it or writing or reading a press release about it , makes it sound like 500 times more complicated that it actually is			0
it 's like trying to explain how to dance in an e-mail			2
if you would just turn it on and do it together , it 'd be way easier			0
i am hoping that it would sort of dissolve this vip status that musicology has -- that 's in only for the chosen few , if you are super clever , and you 've studied for billions of years , you understand about scales .			2
