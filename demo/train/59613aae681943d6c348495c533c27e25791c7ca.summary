-- can anyone stop @entity2 ? that 's the question following the @entity6 side 's 2 - 0 victory over @entity7 wednesday in the last - 16 of the @entity8			1
already 16 points clear in the @entity6 @entity10 and unbeaten in 21 league games , @entity2 is looking like the team to beat once again			1
@entity2 , which is hoping to become the first team to successfully defend the title since the competition was revamped in 1992 , claimed a hard - fought win thanks to @entity18 ' second half strike and @entity20 's header			1
it could and indeed should have been different but @entity7 wasted a glorious opportunity in the early stages when @entity23 missed from the penalty spot			1
the home side 's misery was compounded eight minutes before the break when goalkeeper @entity28 was sent off after bringing down @entity29 in the penalty area			1
@entity31 stood up to take the spot kick but could only strike his effort against the post			1
@entity2 , which won 3 - 1 at @entity35 at the same stage last season , began to lay siege to the @entity7 goal			1
and with nine minutes of the second half having elapsed , @entity40 unleashed a sumptuous strike which flew past substitute goalkeeper @entity43			2
the visitors refused to let up in their pressure and @entity29 had an effort well saved when his shot appeared destined for the far corner			0
@entity50 's side did finally secure the second goal it so badly craved when substitute @entity20 headed home @entity53 's cross with three minutes of normal time remaining			1
there was still time for @entity18 , who scored in the game between the clubs last season , to hit the post with a measured drive			1
@entity7 will now head to @entity60 on march 11 with hopes of pulling off a repeat of their 2 - 0 victory last season			1
the same result would give @entity67 's men the opportunity to take the tie into extra-time but it faces an uphill struggle against a rampant @entity2			1
" we started really well and deserved one goal , " @entity7 defender per @entity73 told @entity74			1
" we dropped and dropped after the red card			0
we kept our defensive spirit			0
" we lost here 3 - 1 last year against @entity2 and went there and beat them and we are looking forward to @entity60			1
why ca n't we get back in it ? " i think there is no doubt there was contact ( for the penalty )			2
i do n't know if it was a red card because the ball was a long way from @entity28			0
" @entity2 coach @entity50 was pleased with his side 's performance but says there is still work to do			1
" @entity7 were much much much better than us for the first 20 minutes			2
after the red card for their goalkeeper it was another game , " he told @entity74			2
" when he is the last man then the referee says penalty and red card			2
" it is difficult to play when you see nine players in the box			0
it is not easy , never			0
but importantly we controlled this situation and played with patience and at the end found the goal			0
" last year @entity2 had a better result than this evening			2
it depends on our heads ( the second leg )			0
" in the night 's other game , @entity113 's 83rd minute strike gave @entity115 a priceless 1 - 0 win at @entity117			1
@entity117 , the seven time champion , enjoyed the better of the chances with @entity121 's effort tipped onto the crossbar by @entity115 goalkeeper @entity123			2
the @entity125 goalkeeper also produced a fine save to turn @entity127 's header onto the post as the home side threatened an opener			0
but @entity117 was made to pay for its wasteful nature when @entity113 stole in at the far post to score a crucial away goal			0
" it was a very difficult match against a great rival but we knew how to soak up the pressure and at the key moment we went after the win , " @entity113 told @entity135 's @entity134			0
" we have a solid advantage and now it 's about going back to the @entity144 and maintaining it			0
" it 's not over yet but we know it 's a good result tonight			0
" we have confidence in ourselves			0
some people have been doubting us recently but we have no doubts			0
we are a team and we are very strong			0
