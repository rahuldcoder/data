-- @entity1 said it all -- " we did n't expect an easy game like that			2
" @entity1 could have been forgiven for expecting more of a challenge from one of the most expensively assembled teams in @entity10 football			2
but the @entity11 will not lose too much sleep over the way @entity14 capitulated against a @entity15 which simply oozed class			1
@entity15 , which won the @entity17 last year , claimed a 3 - 1 win -- a result which flattered @entity14 for the most part			1
easy " the first 70 minutes we played some terrific football , " @entity1 told @entity21			2
" we were so dominant against a big team in @entity25			2
we did n't expect an easy game like that			2
" it is a compliment to our team but we expected more from @entity14			1
we did n't give them any space , we pressed them right up to the goalkeeper and they just kicked it away			2
sometimes they gave us too much space and we used space well			2
" @entity14 's disastrous flirtation with the @entity17 was supposed to end with the arrival of new manager @entity41			1
it has failed to make it past the group stage in its two previous attempts and it faces a challenge once more			0
make no mistake about it -- if this was a boxing contest then the referee would have brought this bout to a halt at halftime			0
@entity15 , which is highly fancied to successfully defend its title this year , produced a level of performance which @entity14 could only dream of			1
from the moment @entity59 's drive somehow flew through the grasp of @entity14 's goalkeeper @entity62 , @entity15 was rampant			1
@entity14 , which was beaten by @entity63 in the @entity64 at the weekend , looked off the pace and unable to keep up with their opponent			1
that @entity15 managed to score just once in the opening 45 minutes was the only surprise -- but it soon made sure of victory with the help of some inept @entity14 defending			1
@entity71 was the guilty party on this occasion , failing to track the run of @entity75 , who was afforded the freedom of the penalty area before firing past the stranded @entity62			0
city was stunned and @entity1 added a third just four minutes later after unleashing a rasping effort which beat @entity62 at the near post			0
to its credit , @entity41 's team did offer a response with substitute @entity84 curling home a delightful effort with 11 minutes of the contest remaining			2
@entity14 sensed an unlikely comeback with four minutes to go when @entity89 was shown a straight red card after taking out former teammate @entity91			1
champions @entity93 curled the free kick against the crossbar but @entity15 negotiated the final few minutes to record an emphatic victory			1
" we knew they were a really good team and they showed that			0
that is why they are champions , " @entity14 defender @entity101 told @entity21			1
" they did n't play with a striker and there was so much movement			0
it felt like they had an extra man and i wish them all the best			0
" hopefully we can now improve			0
we tried , there were some tired legs out there but we can do better than that			0
" in the group 's other game , @entity117 overcame @entity120 3 - 2 to move level on points with @entity14			1
@entity123 @entity123 was forced to settle for a point in @entity125 after it squandered the advantage to finish 1 - 1 at @entity127			1
@entity128 gave @entity123 a first half lead but the home side equalized through @entity131 with 14 minutes remaining			1
@entity132 made his 145th @entity17 appearance to set a new competition record but he failed to find a way to inspire @entity123 to victory			1
" the team stood up well tonight , " @entity123 boss @entity137 told @entity21			1
" we got a good goal early doors			0
it looked like we would have stopped them from scoring until the goal			0
" we said at half time we had to keep the ball better			0
i 'm disappointed we did n't pass it better			0
if we got the second goal from @entity149 [ @entity150 ] we would have seen it out			0
" @entity128 @entity123 has suffered its worst start to a @entity64 season in 24 years and was beaten at home by @entity154 last weekend			1
but goalscorer @entity128 was encouraged by his side 's latest display			0
" in the end it was a decent result , " he said			0
" we got the goal early			0
they then got a goal and that 's the disappointing part			0
i do n't think many teams come here and get three points -- we would have liked to have got three points			0
" elsewhere , @entity166 secured a 2 - 1 home win over @entity168 thanks to a last minute strike from @entity170			2
@entity171 had given the @entity173 side the lead on the stroke of halftime before @entity177 equalized for @entity168			0
@entity168 @entity178 scored twice as @entity179 eased to a 4 - 0 win over @entity181 to make it two wins out of two			1
@entity184 also netted twice as @entity168 moved four points clear at the top of @entity187 that 's because @entity189 was held to a 2 - 2 draw by @entity191 in @entity192			1
the home side had looked set for victory after goals from @entity196 and @entity197 had canceled out @entity199 's opener			1
but @entity201 's side claimed a dramatic equalizer late on when @entity203 fired home			2
@entity205 @entity205 scored twice and @entity206 grabbed the other as @entity208 thrashed @entity209 3 - 0			1
the @entity211 side have won both of its opening two group games and sits three points clear of @entity215 in second , which won 3 - 0 at @entity217			0
the night belonged to @entity215 star @entity218 who became the first @entity219 to score a hat - trick in the @entity17 .			0

@entity15 *cruises* to victory over @entity14
@entity123 held in @entity125 by @entity127
@entity179 and @entity208 both triumph
@entity189 held at home by @entity191
