-- it 's the weekend			0
that makes three good , maybe even great , reasons to party			0
and rest assured , there will be plenty of revelry saturday in the land of samba			2
there always is , on any day			0
but that does not mean that harsh realities wo n't intervene -- perhaps related to protests , stadium problems or other issues that dogged the @entity3 in the weeks leading up to football 's biggest tournament			1
here 's a look at five things to look out for saturday , both on and off the field			1
two @entity26 football stalwarts face off after one game thursday and three on friday , saturday will be the first day with four @entity3			1
while all offer intrigue in their own way , from a sports perspective , one stands out : @entity32 and @entity33			1
one of them , @entity32 , claims to have invented the sport though it can only claim one @entity3 title , from 1966			1
@entity33 , on the other hand , won the most recent of its four championships in 2006			1
history aside , there 's no clear favorite in saturday 's contest			2
@entity33 and @entity32 are about as evenly matched as they come , heading into the tournament ninth and tenth respectively in the @entity46 world rankings			1
spotlight on stadium construction but the story for the @entity32 - @entity33 tilt is n't just that they 're playing , but where they are playing : in @entity53			1
that 's probably not the first place you think of , when you think of @entity5			0
the capital of the @entity60 state , it is more than 1,700 miles from @entity61			0
and critics have latched on to construction of a stadium in this relatively remote locale not just for its cost , but they also question its usefulness and point out potential danger			0
to the latter point , a man identified as @entity71 fell 35 meters to his death while working to build the stadium			0
stadium construction worker dies his was the fifth death , nationwide , involved in the construction of @entity3 venues			1
there are also concerns that playing games in the thick of the tropics might put players ' health at risk , once the games begin			2
the forecast saturday in @entity53 calls for high temperatures in high 80s			1
but -- even if it is in the rain forest -- there 's not expected to be rain to cool things down			0
where not to find lush grass ? the @entity95 still , the game will go on saturday at the @entity97 -- that being the official name for the @entity53 stadium			1
does that mean the stadium is ready for the spotlight ? not necessarily			0
the @entity103 newspaper , the @entity102 , reports that power cables hang from walls in locker rooms and that workers very recently put on a final coat of asphalt			0
but the main focus , and concern , is about where all the action will take place on the field			2
pictures posted online showed a spotty patchwork of grass , looking dry and bare in spots despite it being set in one of the lushest regions in the world			0
numerous reports -- and more photos -- indicate the grounds crew have been spraying the field green , to make the pitch look better			2
@entity129 spray and goal - line technology the funny thing is that having people spray the grass in the middle of a @entity3 arena was supposed to be one of the biggest and best changes tied to the 2014 tournament			2
watch saturday to see yourself : referees now carry around a white spray they can use to mark , say , a line 10 yards from a free kick spot			0
it stays visible long enough to prevent players from creeping up , then vanishes soon after that			0
vanishing spray makes @entity3 debut that 's not the only notable development in this year 's @entity3			2
those who watched friday 's @entity154 - @entity153 contest saw the debut of a new system designed to track whether a ball crosses the goal line or not			0
the system of cameras and sensors can follow the ball at a rate of up to 500 images per second and instantly alert a referee when it crosses the line			0
technology aims to get rid of ' ghost goals ' every team has a story saturday 's three other games , and six other teams besides @entity32 and @entity33 , have plenty of their own story lines as well			1
for @entity177 , led by 34 - year - old club journeyman @entity176 , it 's about whether it can surge , as it did in winning the prestigious 2004 @entity180 tournament ? for @entity181 , will goalkeeper @entity182 get on the field in his fifth @entity3 to become the oldest player in tournament history ? ( he turns 43 later this month			1
) for @entity187 , can it represent @entity188 well -- as one of the continent 's most well - respected teams -- by overcoming @entity192 , or the @entity192 , in a nighttime contest in @entity194 ? for @entity192 , can the 6 - foot - 3 @entity195 -- who scored 20 goals in @entity199 's championship @entity198 season -- make an argument that he 's one of the world 's best attacking midfielders ? for @entity203 , which cruised through qualifying -- including handing the @entity205 its biggest drubbing -- surprise the skeptics and make its way through a packed @entity209 ? and can @entity210 successfully kick off its quest to go two - for - two in @entity212 in @entity5 , having defeated the @entity214 superpower the last time the tourney was held here , in 1950 ? stay tuned .			1

there will be four @entity3 games , in four locations , on saturday
the most highly anticipated matchup may be between @entity32 , @entity33
they *'ll* meet in the @entity95 city of @entity53 ; field conditions are a concern
@entity177 , @entity210 , @entity187 , @entity192 , @entity203 and @entity181 will also play
