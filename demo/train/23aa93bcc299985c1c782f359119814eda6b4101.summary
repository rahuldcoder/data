@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , the latest @entity4 presidential candidate to surge in the polls , found himself in the hot seat tuesday night at a debate in @entity1 centered on economic matters			1
the linchpin of @entity3 's campaign , his cleverly titled 9 - 9 - 9 plan to restructure the @entity10 , came under harsh scrutiny as other @entity4 sought to knock the former @entity15 ceo off his pedestal			1
the @entity3 plan would implement a 9 % corporate income tax rate , a 9 % income tax rate and a 9 % national sales tax			1
his opponents called the plan unrealistic and said it stands zero chance of passing on @entity25			2
" i think it 's a catchy phrase , in fact , i thought it was the price of a pizza when i first heard it , " former @entity31 gov. @entity30 joked			0
" we need something that 's doable , doable , doable			0
" two candidates competing with @entity3 for conservative voters in the leadoff caucus state of @entity37 , former sen. @entity38 of @entity39 and rep. @entity40 of @entity41 , sharply questioned @entity3 's economic credentials			1
@entity38 asked audience members at @entity44 to raise their hands if they support a new sales tax			0
no one in the crowd appeared to do so			0
" there you go , @entity3			2
that 's how many votes you 'll get in @entity1			0
" he added , " can we trust you with your lack of experience that you wo n't continually give @entity56 the ability to take freedom away from freedom - loving people ? " @entity40 said the plan would do little to create jobs and would simply offer the government a new way to collect tax revenue			1
" when you take the 9 - 9 - ( 9 ) plan and you turn it upside won , the devil is in the details , " @entity40 said , a reference to 666 , a symbol commonly associated with @entity72			1
@entity3 defended his plan as a fresh solution			1
" therein lies the difference between me , the nonpolitician , and all of the politicians , " he said			0
" they want to pass what they think they can get passed rather than what we need , which is a bold solution			1
" rep. @entity85 of @entity86 also attacked @entity3 for naming former @entity88 chairman @entity87 as the kind of person he would appoint to the @entity88 if elected			1
" @entity87 was a disaster , " @entity85 said , saying that @entity87 manipulated @entity92 currency and helped usher in the current economic crisis			0
former house speaker @entity95 attacked the current @entity88 chairman , @entity96 , and said the central banking system should be subject to greater oversight			0
" @entity96 has in secret spent hundred of billions of dollars bailing out one group and not bailing out another group , " @entity99 said			0
" it is corrupt and wrong for one man to have that secret power			0
" eight candidates participated in the economy - themed debate at @entity44 , sponsored by @entity109 and the @entity110			2
while some candidates trained their sights on @entity3 , others tried to sully former @entity115 gov. @entity114 , who has solidified his lead in national polls and in @entity1 , a state central to his nomination strategy			1
but as in previous debates , @entity114 , a tested campaigner , parried several attacks and kept the focus on jobs and the economy			2
share your view on the debate in one portion of the debate , moderators allowed the candidates to ask questions of one another			0
@entity86 gov. @entity132 pressed @entity114 on his health care overhaul in @entity115 , which he compared to @entity135 's national plan			1
@entity114 turned the question around on @entity132			1
" we have less than 1 % of our kids that are uninsured , " @entity114 said			2
" you have a million kids uninsured in @entity86			2
under president @entity144 , the percentage uninsured went down			0
under your leadership , it 's gone up			0
" @entity132 , who has been criticized by @entity114 for not outlining a detailed economic plan , said he would begin rolling out a platform in the coming days , beginning with a speech this week on boosting domestic energy production			1
" it 's time for another @entity92 declaration of independence , " @entity132 said			2
" it 's time for energy independence			0
