-- the selection of a @entity5 military commander to head the @entity7 monitoring mission in @entity2 is a " farce " because of his government 's actions in the embattled @entity13 region , a @entity2 opposition group said wednesday			1
lt. gen. @entity14 has been named to chair the monitoring mission , designed to see whether the @entity17 regime is taking appropriate measures to end more than nine months of civil strife across the country			2
@entity21 and his monitoring team arrived in the @entity2 city of @entity24 on tuesday , and the observers were fanning out to other trouble spots wednesday , including @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			2
the objections to @entity14 's presence appeared in a statement from the @entity33 in @entity34			2
the remarks showed up in a post on the website of the @entity38 of @entity2 , a major opposition activist network			0
" the appointment of @entity14 taints the @entity7 's efforts and characterizes it as nothing more than a political farce , causing little help but much harm to the situation in @entity2			1
we call for a fair , independent observer mission to be allowed full and unrestricted access to all areas of @entity2			0
it would be more appropriate , in our view , in the circumstances of the current conflict , for the @entity55 to be mandated to conduct the monitoring mission , " the statement said			0
rebels in @entity13 have fought government forces and allied militiamen , such as the @entity60 , since 2003			0
the @entity55 reported as many as 300,000 people were killed and there has been widespread displacement over the years in @entity13 , located in western @entity5			1
the @entity67 , investigating genocide and crimes against humanity in @entity13 , issued arrest warrants for @entity5 president @entity69 , then - government minister @entity70 , @entity60 leader @entity71 , and defense minister @entity72			1
it issued summonses to appear for @entity75 and @entity76 , two rebel leaders accused of spearheading an attack that killed 12 @entity80 peacekeepers			0
an @entity7 source told @entity0 that the claims against @entity14 " come with no evidence			1
" but the @entity2 opposition statement said @entity14 was a director of @entity5 's military intelligence " during the early years " of @entity69 's " salvation regime			1
" " he was later appointed as head of @entity88 before he returned in 1996 to the military as the deputy chief of general staff			0
it was during this time that @entity21 is accused of allowing or at the very least , turning a blind eye , to mass atrocities being committed in @entity13 , " the statement said			1
" although not the subject of an investigation by the @entity67 in @entity96 , his role as the deputy head of @entity88 , raises questions as to his knowledge of mass atrocities in @entity13 and consequently his role as the head of an investigative commission tasked with identifying whether the @entity17 regime is responsible for committing crimes against humanity			2
" the opposition movement says there is widespread " incredulity " and " condemnation " over the appointment because of his roles in @entity5			0
" @entity21 is now tasked with probing war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed against @entity2 victims			0
it is enough that the @entity2 victims have had to wait this long for an observer mission , with calls being made as early as april 2011			0
now over 30 of the members of the @entity7 observer mission are of @entity5 origin , " the statement said			2
@entity128 , the head of @entity129 based in @entity130 , also complained to the @entity7 about @entity14 and the @entity13 connection			1
" this is not acceptable and could jeopardize the credibility of the mission and its role , " @entity128 said			0
the @entity136 , a group devoted to fighting genocide and crimes against humanity and focused on crises in several @entity142 nations , has called the choice " perplexing			1
" " when he served as @entity5 's former head of @entity148 and when he oversaw implementation of the @entity151 , alleged war crimes including genocide were committed on his watch , " @entity145 analyst @entity144 said last week			2
" instead of heading a team entrusted with a probe of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity by @entity2 , the general should be investigated by the @entity67 for evidence of similar crimes in @entity5			1
" journalist @entity161 contributed to this report			0

new : an @entity7 source says the claims " come with no evidence "
the @entity67 has issued warrants for some @entity5 , including the president
enough @entity136 called the choice of @entity14 ' perplexing '
@entity21 is accused of " turning a blind eye " to @entity13
