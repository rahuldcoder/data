-- on the wing of an empty airplane , a young boy is practicing his backward - bend			1
in the cockpit , a crowd have gathered -- taking it in turns to play captain			1
from an outsider 's perspective , @entity10 -- once a makeshift arsenal for the armed forces of the @entity13 -- is probably the last place you 'd expect to find a makeshift playground			1
to locals , such dichotomies are typical of the once conflict - ridden region			1
" for me this captures the @entity13 experience , " says @entity23 , a photojournalist who shot the images in 2012			1
" on the one hand , this is a place that is often in the news as a very horrific place , because of course , very horrific things have happened there			0
but there are also beautiful things that happen there , " he says			0
years of war and a volcanic eruption in 2002 -- which saw much of the city and large swaths of the airport overrun with lava -- pretty much shut down any commercial activity at the site			2
though @entity10 essentially fell into disuse , the locals have made use of the leftover volcanic rocks -- from which many constructed their homes -- and the abandoned aircraft that pepper the place			2
" while i was there , i saw children going through the planes , collecting parts and hacking at the engines to get the wires			2
my fixer , @entity61 , said these materials were later sold on the street to be used in other products			0
a hunk of steel can be used in a stove , the wires could be used in other electronics			0
there , everything is recycled , in a way			0
" even adults play make - believe outside of serving a utilitarian function , @entity10 has acted as a kind of @entity76 for the locals -- inviting them to dream big even if their means were small			1
@entity61 recalled a friend who had always wanted to be a pilot			0
" his parents were too poor and all the schools were expensive , so he could not hold onto that dream , " @entity61 told @entity23			1
when @entity87 erupted , @entity61 's friend was one of a hundred locals who rushed to move the planes before they got swallowed up by the encroaching lava			2
emptied of fuel , food and passengers , the aircraft proved easy to shift			0
@entity61 's friend jumped inside the plane to steer it while the others pushed -- briefly living out the dream he never got to see fulfilled			0
" @entity61 described the experience as exhilarating for his friend , " recalls @entity23			1
' these images are unique ' @entity23 was in @entity10 when the @entity103 rebels captured the city from the @entity13 government			1
though the site was manned by rebels , he says , that never prevented the local children from playing in the debris			2
" if no planes were coming in , the troops would allow villagers to move across the runway with water and groceries , " he recalls			0
they did not , however , grant him access to the site			0
when the rebels cleared out of the city , there was a short period when the airport was unmanned before @entity13 government forces ( @entity123 ) moved in			1
" really , these images are unique , because access is so difficult , " he says			0
" i saw this brief window when no one was at the airport			2
i saw the kids running around inside and decided to try one more time before i was blocked			2
this time , i was successful			0
" since that first visit , a wall has been erected around the airport			1
" after that one afternoon , we could not get access again , " he recalls			0
" with the wall there , i 'm not sure if the kids are allowed in any more -- i ca n't see them			1

in 2012 , children turned an empty airport in @entity13 into a makeshift playground
the airport was unmanned for a *day*
photojournalist @entity23 used the power *vacuum* to *document* the kids at play
since , a wall has been built , barring locals from using the airport
