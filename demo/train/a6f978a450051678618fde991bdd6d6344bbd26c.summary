@entity1 , @entity0 -- in a stunning upset that reshaped the @entity7 political landscape , @entity4 @entity3 won tuesday 's special election in @entity0 for the @entity10 seat formerly held by liberal democrat @entity11			1
@entity3 defeated democrat @entity12 , the state attorney general			1
@entity3 's victory made real the once unthinkable prospect of a @entity4 filling the seat held by @entity11 , known as the liberal lion , for almost 47 years until his death due to brain cancer last august			1
before @entity11 won the seat for the first time in 1962 , his older brother @entity19 held it for nearly eight years until his election as @entity7 president in 1960			2
" this really does change everything , you know that ? " said @entity24 , the former @entity4 governor of @entity0 who introduced @entity3 at his victory rally			2
share your thoughts on the election results voters across @entity0 braved winter cold and snow for an election with high stakes -- the domestic agenda of president @entity39 , including his top domestic priority , health care reform			2
@entity3 's victory strips @entity43 of their 60 - seat @entity10 super-majority , needed to overcome @entity4 filibusters against future @entity10 action on a broad range of @entity49 priorities			1
@entity43 needed all 60 votes in their caucus to pass the health care bill , and the loss of one seat now imperils generating that support again for a compromise measure worked out with the @entity49			1
" forty one , forty one , " chanted the crowd at @entity3 's rally , referring to his new status as the @entity10 's 41st @entity4			1
@entity3 , a state senator until now , heralded his victory as the start of more election surprises in 2010			0
no @entity4 had won a @entity10 race in @entity0 since 1972 , and @entity43 control the governorship , both houses of the state legislature , and the state 's entire congressional delegation			1
" when there 's trouble in @entity0 , rest assured there 's trouble everywhere , and they know it , " @entity3 said of the @entity70			2
@entity4 leaders sounded a similar theme , saying @entity7 were fed up with what they called @entity70 arrogance in @entity82			0
" @entity7 are investing their hopes in good @entity4 candidates to reverse a year - long @entity12 trend of ignoring the @entity7 people on the issues of health care , spending and the growth of government , " senate minority leader @entity83 , @entity84 , said in a statement			1
the seat vacated by @entity11 's death is currently held by his former aide and longtime friend @entity97 , who was appointed on an interim basis			1
@entity39 called @entity3 and @entity12 on tuesday night , and a @entity49 statement said the president " told sen. @entity3 that he looks forward to working with him on the urgent economic challenges facing @entity0 families and struggling families across our nation			2
" @entity0 secretary of state @entity108 said last week that certifying tuesday 's election results could take more than two weeks -- potentially enough time to allow congressional democrats to pass a final health care bill before @entity3 is seated			1
but multiple @entity70 sources said that is unlikely			0
even if @entity49 and @entity10 @entity43 could reach a deal to meld their bills and pass them in the next couple of weeks , there would be a huge outcry from not only @entity4 , but also an increasingly distrustful public if they appeared to be rushing it through			1
@entity108 had predicted as many 2.2 million of the state 's 4.5 million registered voters would vote -- at least double the turnout from december 's primary			0
in one sign of high interest , more than 100,000 absentee ballots were requested ahead of the election , according to @entity131 , @entity108 's spokesman			0
@entity12 was initially expected to easily win the race to replace @entity11 , who made health care reform the centerpiece of his @entity10 career			1
until recently , @entity3 was underfunded and unknown statewide			0
waging a nationally backed campaign that included driving his pickup around the state , @entity3 surged in the weeks preceding tuesday 's vote and led in all the final polls			2
in a sign of the high stakes involved , the @entity12 campaign held an afternoon news conference tuesday to complain that voters in three places received ballots already marked for @entity3			2
@entity131 confirmed that the secretary of state 's offices received two reports of voters saying they received pre-marked ballots			0
the suspect ballots were invalidated and the voters received new ballots , @entity131 said			0
@entity157 , the @entity12 campaign manager , said the " disturbing incidents " raised questions about the integrity of the election			0
in response , the @entity3 campaign issued a statement criticizing @entity12 's team			1
" reports that the @entity12 campaign is making reckless accusations regarding the integrity of today 's election is a reminder that they are a desperate campaign , " @entity166 , the counsel for the @entity3 campaign , said in the statement			1
@entity39 had been " surprised and frustrated " by the race , @entity49 press secretary @entity174 said tuesday			0
@entity39 and former president @entity176 hit the campaign trail in the final week in an attempt to save @entity12 's campaign , which observers say was hampered by complacency and missteps			2
@entity39 crushed sen. @entity183 in @entity0 in 2008 , beating the @entity4 presidential nominee by 26 points			0
" if you were fired up in the last election , i need you more fired up in this election , " @entity39 urged a crowd at a @entity12 campaign rally on sunday			0
@entity191 , the late senator 's widow , called on state democrats to turn out to save her husband 's legacy			0
" we need your help			0
we need you to get out there and vote on tuesday , " @entity11 said			2
" we need you to bring your neighbors			0
we need you to bring your friends			0
" @entity3 , who has trumpeted his 30 years of service in the @entity203 , hewed to traditional @entity4 themes in his victory speech			2
he promised to back tax cuts and be tough on terrorists , and to oppose @entity39 's health care overhaul effort			1
" people do not want a trillion dollar health - care plan that is being forced on the @entity7 people , " @entity3 said			2
@entity3 said his victory defied " the odds and experts " who predicted that the @entity10 seat held by @entity43 for more than 50 years would not change hands			1
instead , independent voters who outnumber registered @entity43 and @entity4 combined in @entity0 strongly supported @entity3			1
" tonight , the independent majority has delivered a great victory , " @entity3 said , later adding : " what happened here in @entity0 can happen all over @entity7			0
" facing the possibility of @entity12 's defeat , @entity43 were trying to figure out whether they could pass a health care overhaul without that crucial 60th @entity10 vote			1
but top @entity49 aides publicly insisted they were not engaging in any talk of contingency plans because they thought @entity12 would win			0
two @entity70 sources in close contact with the @entity49 told @entity2 on monday that they 'd urged the administration , in the event of a @entity3 victory , to push @entity49 @entity43 to pass the @entity10 's health care bill as currently written			1
doing so would prevent the plan from having to be taken up by the @entity10 again			0
" i think the @entity10 bill clearly is better than nothing , " @entity49 majority leader @entity237 , @entity238 , said tuesday			0
a third option would be for @entity43 to revisit the idea of trying to push health care through the @entity10 with only 51 votes -- a simple majority			1
but to do that @entity43 would have to use a process known as reconciliation , which presents technical and procedural issues that would delay the process for a long time			0
a number of @entity43 are eager to put the health care debate behind them and move on to economic issues such as job creation as soon as possible this election year			1
@entity43 could also try again to get moderate @entity4 sen. @entity257 of @entity258 to vote for a compromise health reform plan			1
multiple @entity70 sources , however , have said they think that is unlikely now			0
@entity2 's @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity264 , @entity270 and @entity271 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 @entity3 upsets @entity12 to fill @entity11 's seat
win leaves @entity43 without crucial 60th @entity10 vote needed for health care overhaul
@entity3 's *platform* includes backing tax cuts , being tough on terrorists
