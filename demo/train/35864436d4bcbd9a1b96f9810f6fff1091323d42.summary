@entity0 -- it has been said over and over again : the 2010 midterm is the anti-incumbent , anti-washington and by virtue of their position in power , the anti-democratic election			0
a sputtering economy , 9.6 percent national unemployment rate , housing crisis and little hope for a quick turnaround on the jobs front has forced @entity17 on the defense heading into november			2
ok , that is an understatement			0
@entity17 are under siege all across the country and are in deep danger of losing control of the @entity24 and if a massive wave develops on november 2 , perhaps even the @entity26			1
fueled by a huge fundraising effort by the @entity29 , the @entity27 is also in position to reclaim more than a half dozen governorships including in states that president @entity33 easily won in 2008 such as @entity34 , @entity35 , and @entity36			1
the new @entity1 / @entity37 offers data that shows @entity17 running for @entity26 seats in four key states are in dire straits and a president with little juice to help propel them to victory			1
in all four of these states : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , @entity33 's job approval rating ranges from a low of 33 percent ( @entity48 ) to a high of 42 percent ( @entity50 )			1
the anti-washington , thus anti-democratic , theme shines like a bright neon sign in each of these races			0
and the @entity27 's rubber stamp argument seems to be resonating with voters , whether it is true or not : sending , say , @entity48 sen. @entity61 back to @entity0 means she will be a rubber stamp for @entity33			1
@entity63 , who stuck to her centrist views and beat back a strong primary challenge from her political left earlier this year , is trailing her @entity27 opponent , rep. @entity69 , by 14 points			2
in @entity50 , @entity17 @entity26 nominee @entity71 is down 15 points to @entity27 @entity73			1
and in @entity49 , @entity27 @entity26 nominee @entity74 has a 26 point lead over @entity77 @entity76 in a three way race that also features @entity79			1
@entity79 is running an independent bid for the @entity26 seat and trails @entity74 by 14 points			1
( the @entity82 is also making the claim to @entity85 voters that the popular @entity17 gov. @entity86 would be a rubber stamp for @entity33 if elected to the @entity26 )			1
but the @entity17 running for governor in three of four of these states surveyed by @entity1 / @entity37 / @entity90 shows that these candidates are either competitive or leading in their individual races			1
@entity48 gov. @entity93 has a 27 - point lead over his @entity27 rival @entity95 ; @entity50 gov. @entity96 is up one point over @entity27 opponent @entity98 ; and in the race for @entity49 governor , democrat @entity99 trails @entity27 @entity102 by three points , which is within the poll 's 3.5 percent margin of error			1
so , i think it is fair to say -- outside of @entity47 -- that @entity17 incumbents and candidates in these three states are not being stuck in the same category as their @entity17 counterparts running for @entity26			1
that is not to say the national mood is not having a negative affect on these @entity17 , it just has n't been devastating			2
as for the @entity1 / @entity117 , i dug a little deeper into the survey and found these interesting data points : @entity47 : @entity120 obviously faces a difficult challenge in having her supporters correctly write - in her name on the ballot on november 2			0
the poll shows that @entity120 and @entity27 nominee @entity126 are tied at 37 percent , with @entity17 nominee @entity127 registering support at 23 percent			1
but when respondents were asked if they might choose another candidate if they think the write - in procedure is too complicated , 3 percent answered yes			0
so , take that 3 percent away from @entity120 's 37 percent and all of a sudden @entity126 is up three points			2
@entity120 is still within in the margin of error , but as @entity1 polling director @entity136 noted " in a tight race , this might be the difference between winning and losing			0
" @entity120 's greatest support comes from @entity139 and the @entity140 , while @entity126 wins @entity141 and the @entity139 area when you expand it beyond the city limits			2
@entity48 : how troubling is this for @entity77 @entity61 ? she is losing the woman vote to @entity27 @entity69 by eight points			2
she performs strongest in the east , while @entity69 wins every other region of the state			0
@entity49 : @entity27 @entity74 is winning independents by four points over @entity79 , who is running an independent bid			2
@entity74 's lead is within the 6 percent margin of error			0
@entity74 is also winning every corner of the state except southern @entity49 / @entity161 area where @entity79 holds a modest lead over the @entity27 nominee and the @entity17 nominee @entity76			1
in the governor 's race , democrat @entity99 is losing every region to @entity27 @entity102 , but is crushing him in the southern @entity49 / @entity161 area			1
@entity99 , too , has soft support with women			0
she leads @entity102 by five points with women voters , but that is within the 5 percent margin of error for that specific question			0
@entity50 : in the @entity26 contest , democrat @entity71 is losing to @entity27 @entity73 among men and woman and in every age category			1
geographically , @entity71 leads @entity73 in the @entity182 area by eight points , but that is within the 8.5 percent margin of error			0
@entity73 is winning in every other part of the state			0
as for the competitive governor 's race , @entity96 is winning women , while @entity98 wins men			2
@entity96 has a 15 - point lead over @entity98 with voters who earn less than $ 50,000 , while @entity98 has an 11 - point lead over @entity96 with voters who earn more than $ 50,000			0
@entity98 has an 11 - point lead over @entity96 with independents			0
as for geographic regions , @entity96 is leading in the @entity182 area and the central part of the state ( the latter is within the margin of error ) , while @entity98 is carrying @entity207 / @entity206 and has a slight lead in @entity209			0
in the industrial north , the two candidates are dead even .			0

democrats running for @entity26 seats in four key states are in dire straits
@entity27 's @entity33 rubber stamp argument seems to be resonating with voters
but @entity17 running for governor in three states are competitive or leading
