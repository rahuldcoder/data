@entity1 , @entity0 -- the term " eco community " might conjure up an image of bearded hippies tending an allotment before sharing a mung bean stew			2
but as today 's urbanites become more concerned about reducing their carbon footprints , some are finding that modern eco communities offer them a way to live sustainably without foregoing their home comforts			1
the @entity15 is a cohousing project that emphasizes sustainability			0
communities that put an emphasis on green values range from isolated eco villages to sophisticated co-housing projects			1
co-housing was dreamed up in @entity24 in the idealistic 60s			2
it allows residents to live in communities where they own their own homes but are actively involved in running their own neighborhoods , which often include a common house where shared dining and other activities are an option			1
@entity35 , from the @entity36 , told @entity2 , " more and more people keep contacting us about getting involved in co-housing communities -- there 's an unquenchable thirst for this sort of thing			1
" as well as co-housing being widespread in @entity46 , the @entity44 claims there are more than 150 co-housing communities in the @entity49 but where co-housing projects were once primarily intended as a return to a more collective , less isolated way of living , new projects often place an emphasis on sustainable living			1
the @entity15 and @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity49 , is a new co-housing project designed to the highest green standards , including the @entity49 @entity61 's @entity63 benchmark			1
@entity15 co-founder @entity64 says its 29 homes are densely insulated and have triple glazing , meaning they are virtually airtight			0
a heat recovery system uses warm exhaust air to heat incoming fresh air , minimizing heat loss			0
homes are heated by a centralized wood pellet boiler system , with the pellets sourced from a manufacturer based 5 miles away			0
and the 70 - acre site includes a farm , which means the community can grow its own food or have it grown right on their doorstep by professional farmers			2
all this helps minimize residents ' carbon footprint , and that 's a big attraction for many			0
@entity88 is an editor and writer who has just moved to the neighborhood with his wife and two children			0
" with the home we were living in before it would have been very difficult to do a lot of retro fitting to it or do things to make it more energy efficient , " he explains " but here we 're moving to a place where other people have spent a lot of time thinking about these things and have made very good choices about the energy efficiency of the home and its environmental impact			2
someone else has taken the time and effort and had the expertise to make those choices carefully and we 've taken advantage of it by buying into it			0
" it 's that opportunity to live in purpose - built sustainable homes that attracted another resident , @entity116 , a psychotherapist , who moved to the neighborhood with his partner 7 months ago			1
like @entity88 , he says it would have been exceptionally difficult and expensive to retrofit his previous home to be more energy efficient			0
now he gets to live his green dream			1
would you like to live in an eco community ? " this summer i can cool off my house by closing it up during the day ; i do n't need any air con			1
in the winter the amount of heat i have to use is really small because the insulation is tremendous			0
it 's exciting to live that way , " says @entity116			2
although work on @entity15 wo n't be completed until the end of the year , over half the homes have been sold and the people choosing to move there are by no means hardcore environmentalists			1
of his own family @entity88 says , " i think we have been environmentally conscious for a long time and have tried to be thoughtful about the way we live , but that 's the way a lot more people are now anyway			1
" as ordinary people become more environmentally aware the idea of eco communities is becoming more mainstream			1
in the @entity152 , @entity151 has won architecture awards for its @entity155 development in @entity156			1
its 14 houses use lots of sustainable timber , are highly insulated , and have heat recovery systems and solar panels			0
like co-housing developments , @entity151 emphasizes community as much as environmentally sound design , with the @entity155 homes facing each other around a village green to encourage social interaction			1
but this kind of green living does n't come cheap , with new @entity155 homes on the market for up to $ 900,000 , a far cry from the inclusive ideology behind archetypal hippy collectives			0
and that 's the catch -- the more creature comforts and environmentally - friendly features are built into a home , the more expensive , and exclusive , it becomes			0
inherent to eco communities is their small scale			1
not only does it provide the social glue that holds them together , it allows communal facilities and equipment , such as lawnmowers , to be shared , reducing the community 's carbon footprint			0
but in a crowded world that size restriction limits how widespread these developments can become			0
while these communities will never be for everyone , @entity35 maintains co-housing is a model for the future			2
" a lot of the basic concepts behind co-housing are applicable to larger housing developments , " she says			2
" some of the principles could be woven in to conventional developments -- things like having the residential area car free , having a common house where you can eat communally from time to time , hold events , and have a children 's room and games room for teenagers			0
" also , having offices for home working means you 're meeting government objectives about reducing carbon footprints and living more sustainably			0

more people are choosing to live sustainably in eco communities
modern co-housing developments often emphasize green values
