-- @entity1 is ensconced in the black velvet cocoon of a small home - recording studio , laying down a demo track while warmed by the glow of spice - scented candles			1
@entity1 is joining the " @entity10 " judges for the show 's eighth season			1
she 's crooning a song she co-wrote -- an encapsulation of falling in love that involves shooting stars and dancing shadows -- in a powerhouse pop voice that lies somewhere between @entity17 and @entity18			1
somewhere good , that is			1
" she kills it every time she sings , " raves her writing partner , @entity20			2
" he 's one of the greatest melody writers i 've ever worked with , " @entity1 returns			1
sweet , right ? so sweet , in fact , that we 're starting to worry for @entity1 , a heretofore behind - the - scenes songwriter - producer who 's about to take on the most - watched , most - dissected job in pop music : when " @entity10 " returns to @entity32 on january 13 , she 'll become a fourth judge to @entity34 , @entity35 , and @entity36			1
it 's a job that requires a distinct dearth of sweetness , and a certain amount of , for lack of a better term , @entity36 - ness			2
" oh , i 'm not gon na be this nice on the show , " @entity1 assures us			1
in case we were n't convinced , she drops this rant when the subject of " idol " auditions comes up : " a lot of times people will sing a big song that they do n't have the voice for instead of bringing out the uniqueness in their tone , " she says			2
" another thing is , do n't cheese me out			2
it 's not a wedding band			2
make me feel like you mean it			2
do n't just sing the way the song was written			1
that was @entity66 's interpretation			2
now what are you gon na do ? " ok , we 're worried again -- but this time for the contestants			2
that 's exactly what " @entity10 's " producers are counting on			1
heading into season 8 , they 're hoping viewers will be as rapt with how @entity1 shakes up " @entity10 's " " dawg " / " beautiful " / " dreadful " judging dynamic as they are with which singer takes the big prize			1
and though the show has constantly worked to stay fresh -- allowing contestants to play instruments last year , for instance -- @entity1 's new energy comes at a critical time , after last season 's ratings took an 8 percent dip from 29.8 million viewers to 27.3 million			1
" idol " actually tried adding a fourth judge once before in season 2 , with @entity92 radio personality @entity91 , but she quit just a few days in , saying it was " uncomfortable for me to tell someone else to give up on their dream			1
" producers expect no such trouble with @entity1 , who regularly evaluates new talent as a vp of @entity102 at @entity103 and co-owner of music production and publishing house @entity106			1
she 's the kind of 38 - year - old who can rock a black leather jacket with leggings and write hits for everyone from @entity114 to @entity115 to the @entity116			1
" she 's very strong - willed , and we needed that with @entity36 around , " explains exec producer @entity118			2
" i do n't want anybody too benign on that panel			2
@entity1 tells it as it is			1
" the feisty spirit that landed @entity1 on @entity125 's most - judged panel of judges goes back to her @entity128 upbringing in @entity129 , @entity92			1
" my grandfather was a guy who came through @entity131 and started a grocery store , " she says			2
" so my father had incredible balls			2
he had this i 'm - gon na - do - whatever - i - want - to - do - and - you - ca n't - stop - me thing that i got			2
" that drive spurred her to college at @entity140 , where she started out in the opera program but did n't quite fit in with the classical crowd -- so instead she went pre-law			2
" i always wanted to be a trial attorney , " she says			2
" i love to argue			0
" after graduation in 1993 , @entity1 was living at home and fronting a garage band called @entity147 -- " covering songs , not writing my own " -- when a friend snagged her an interview for a job as the assistant to the editor in chief and publisher at @entity156 , where she ended up spending five years			1
while mastering the business side of the music industry during her workday , @entity1 spent her downtime learning to craft songs , which she now describes as " the worst things i 've ever heard in my life			1
my first song was called ' @entity165 , ' about a girl who wants the guy to open up his heart			0
it was like , honey , he 's just not that into you			0
" eventually , though , she pulled together a respectable demo that she gave to none other than a pre- " idol " @entity174 in 1998 by simply walking up to the pop star in @entity92 and dropping the name of a @entity156 connection			1
" i asked her if she was any good , " @entity179 recalls			0
" she said , ' yeah , i 'm really good			0
' and i believed her			0
" luckily , the demo delivered on @entity1 's chutzpah : @entity179 liked @entity1 's work so much that she flew her out to stay at her @entity186 home for six weeks of intensive collaboration			1
the results : a song called " spinning around " that became @entity191 's 2000 comeback single -- and a genial relationship with @entity179 that both women hope will help squelch those intra-panel rivalry rumors			0
" we were the best roommates , " says @entity179			0
adds @entity1 , " we did n't have one argument			1
we lived very well together -- it was the strangest thing			0
" the following year @entity1 scored with @entity199 ' multiplatinum album " escape , " on which she co-wrote seven songs			1
the title track in particular revealed her knack for irresistible pop hooks , which led to a stunning roll on those charts published by her former employer			0
with 168 of her songs appearing on multiplatinum albums , you can thank ( or curse ) her for @entity115 's " @entity212 , " @entity214 's " @entity215 , " @entity216 's " @entity213 , " @entity218 's " @entity217 , " @entity220 's " @entity219 , " and @entity114 's " @entity221			1
" she 's also penned cuts for several products of the " idol " machine , including @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , and @entity228			0
industry insiders attribute @entity231 's prolific portfolio to her no - nonsense work ethic			0
" if you 're in a jam and need something done , she 's a great closer , " says @entity233 , whose @entity234 includes @entity1 collaborators the @entity235 and will.i.am			1
" i 'd use her for anything			0
" music mogul @entity242 -- who paired her with @entity214 , @entity243 , and @entity244 , among others -- agrees : " she 's one of the best i 've ever encountered			0
in pop music , where things can be sort of crap and mundane , she finds new twists lyrically , and her melodies are extraordinary			0
" another plus , as far as her " idol " credentials go : she 's got vocal chops			0
" the truth is she can sing like there 's no tomorrow , " @entity118 says			0
" so whereas in the past when the kid would say , ' aw , you could n't sing any better ' and none of the judges even tried , she does , and she can			0
" but the question remains : can she hold her own as a tv star ? sure , she appeared on @entity267 's 2006 " idol " rip - off " @entity269 , " but it was canceled after only four episodes			0
and crashing @entity34 , @entity35 , and @entity36 's party is something else altogether			0
" they 're like brothers and sisters at this point , " she says , having already wrapped the brutal preliminary auditions as well as the @entity276 round			0
" and i 'm like the long - lost cousin who they 're not sure they wanted to see , but now they 're like , okay , you can stay for dinner			0
" she has what sounds like @entity290 's unequivocal -- and ever - so - @entity289 -- endorsement : " i think people will look at me first and say , if the dawg is feeling her , then i should feel her too			0
" for the record , she 'll sit between @entity34 and @entity35			1
" they tried [ putting ] me between her and @entity36 , " explains @entity1 , " but they kept trying to communicate and i did n't want to be in the middle of that			1
" and , yes , both she and @entity179 will be keeping their seats ; producers insist @entity1 is n't being groomed as her former mentor 's replacement			1
" that 's just cheeky journalistic hype , " @entity118 says			0
adds @entity1 , " @entity35 and i have a good vibe			1
i have respect for @entity35			0
i 'm not of the thinking that women should drag each other down			0
" @entity179 says she is n't worrying about her job security ( " i was never told that she was coming in to take my place " ) -- and , in fact , only feels more confident with @entity1 around : " when i heard she was going to be the fourth judge , i thought , ha ha , hee hee , @entity36 has no idea i have an ally now			1
" that 's a relief to @entity1 , who says her biggest challenge will be " being aware of when to shut up			1
" but could her penchant for telling it like it is end up rankling a nation of rabid " idol " fans ? in between singing the praises of a new love on her demo and waxing rhapsodic about writing partner @entity20 , @entity1 muses repeatedly , and without prompting , about whether @entity125 will think she 's just too darn mean			1
" i know who i am , but what are people going to perceive me as ? " she wonders			0
" they may think my intensity and my boldness are bitchy			0
i do n't think i 'm bitchy			0
do you think i 'm bitchy ? " no , but fortunately for " idol , " we think she has a lot of potential			0
