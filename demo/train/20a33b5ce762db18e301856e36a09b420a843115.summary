@entity0 to you , @entity2 the actor has transformed from a man who fans once feared would lose his life to substance abuse to a megastar who also happens to be a devoted husband and father			1
the wisecracking playboy daredevil has taken a back seat to a witty man enthralled with the woman in his life and clearly focused on his work			1
sound familiar ? it 's hard to tell whether @entity2 is channeling @entity17 or whether moviegoers are buying into the actor 's portrayal of " @entity17 " because the character is not that much of a stretch			1
and we are n't the only ones who think so			2
@entity26 posed the question " anyone else got a sneaking suspicion that @entity2 and @entity17 are actually the same person ? " in a story about his 2013 appearance on " @entity32			1
" with the @entity33 going gaga over reports that the actor is in final negotiations to appear as @entity17 in " @entity37 3 , " we can yet again marvel at the fact that there was a time when @entity2 was beyond down and out in @entity42			1
in fact , he was pretty much the @entity45 of his time : an incredibly talented artist who seemed to attract trouble the moment he stepped out the door			2
report : @entity2 to suit up for major role in ' @entity37 3 ' he reportedly had his first experience with drugs at age 6 when his father , director @entity2 , gave him a toke of marijuana ( years later , the elder @entity2 would confess to regretting that decision			1
) in the 1980s , roles in films like " @entity62 " and " @entity63 " gave him honorary status in the @entity65 , a group of hot young actors who dominated the movie scene			0
he also had a highly publicized romance with @entity69 , who would go on to find fame as the star of " @entity72			2
" but for all his luck in love and on screen ( a turn as the iconic @entity77 in the 1992 film " @entity77 " earned him a best actor @entity80 nomination ) the dark side of show business resulted in multiple arrests for everything from driving under the influence to gun possession			2
" it 's like i have a shotgun in my mouth , and i 've got my finger on the trigger , and i like the taste of the gunmetal , " the actor famously told a judge in 1999			2
his lifestyle not only took a toll on his reputation ( he became fodder for jokes when in 1996 , after a night of partying , he wandered into a neighbor 's home in @entity105 and fell asleep in a child 's bed ) , it helped end his relationship with @entity109			0
" i was so selfish , " he said in a 2008 interview			0
" i liked to drink , and i had a drug problem , and that did n't jibe with @entity69 , because it is the furthest thing from what she is			0
she provided me a home and understanding			0
she tried to help me			0
she was so miffed when i did n't get my act together			0
" even a stint on the then very popular show " @entity120 " did n't stop his addiction , and in 2001 , he was fired from the series after yet another drug arrest			0
but like @entity17 , @entity2 wrapped himself in the armor of his work and pulled himself out of the depths of addiction			1
by 2005 , he had critics raving with his performance in films like " @entity131 " and " @entity132			0
" that same year he married producer @entity133 , whom he met when she served as a producer on the 2003 movie " @entity136			0
" @entity133 ( now @entity133 ) told @entity137 that she made it clear to her now - husband that he would have to clean up his act			0
" i did meet @entity141 ( what she calls his troubled persona ) , for like a minute , " she said , " right after the movie wrapped , and i said immediately , ' this is n't gon na work			2
' i made it clear that to stay with me , nothing could happen			0
" the couple became parents of a son in 2012 and announced in july 2014 that they were expecting their second child			0
@entity2 also has an older son from a previous marriage			1
celebs expecting in 2014 such stability has clearly helped @entity2 reach the pinnacle where there is awards buzz for his new film " @entity160			1
" it 's no wonder @entity162 produced a piece titled " 32 reasons @entity2 is the most perfect man in the universe			1
" " you 're very handsome ; do n't let anyone tell you different , " @entity166 said to the actor , to which he responded : " they do n't			2
" " @entity17 " co-star @entity172 went so far as to rank @entity2 's @entity17 above another popular movie superhero , the " @entity173			1
" " ( @entity17 's ) gorgeous , " @entity172 said			1
" i 'm still not convinced with the man in tights and the cape			0
" and with all @entity2 's toughness , resilience and charm , it 's no wonder " @entity32 's " @entity181 had a straight face when he told the actor , " you are @entity17			1

@entity2 has transformed his life
the actor went from troubled star to superstar
he is reportedly *reprising* @entity17 role in " @entity37 3 "
