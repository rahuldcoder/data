-- " @entity1 " is arriving in a marketplace full of " @entity5 " junkies still eager for their supernatural teen - romantic fix , and the film 's concept could n't be clearer : it 's " @entity5 " with the sexes reversed			1
this time it 's the boy who 's the mortal : moody , bookish @entity13 , the outsider in his sleepy small town of @entity16 , @entity17 , though @entity18 plays him more like a sensitive jock on " @entity20			2
" @entity21 ( @entity22 ) , the new girl at school , comes from a family of witches ( or , as they 're known here , casters ) , and on the day she turns 16 she 'll be '' claimed , '' either by the light side or ( more likely , due to a family curse ) the dark side			2
adapted from the popular @entity31 novel by @entity32 and @entity33 , " @entity1 " is lushly pictorial and not - too - badly acted			1
the best thing in the movie is @entity22 , who has a fresh , unretouched , @entity38 - gone - goth allure			1
( she is also @entity39 's daughter			0
) @entity41 , as @entity21 's smoking - jacketed rotter - aristocrat uncle , and @entity43 , as her floridly angry mother , are like blithe spirits out of a @entity46 sequel you want to see			0
but " @entity1 , " more than the " @entity5 " films , lacks danger and momentum			1
the audience , like @entity13 , spends way too much time waiting around for @entity21 to learn whether she 's a good girl or a bad girl			0
