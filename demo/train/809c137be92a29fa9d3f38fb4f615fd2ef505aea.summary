@entity15 was full of visitors celebrating @entity17 when the festive mood turned angry			1
@entity19 said the women wearing the hijab , a traditional @entity12 headscarf , became argumentative when park employees enforced the no - headgear policy and men sprang to their defense			1

police shut down the park for several hours during the incident			2
" it had to do with headgear			2

@entity47 , spokesman for the @entity1 chapter of the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , said members of the @entity51 who had organized the outing asked him to come to the park to mediate			1
@entity47 said the women felt they had been targeted by park employees because of their religious views			1
" they 're the most obvious @entity57 around because they have hijabs on			1
they felt they were discriminated against , " @entity47 said			1
" maybe there was a level of frustration that went around across the board , " @entity47 said			0
" then you have the parks people who are trying to explain this and do their job			0
" @entity47 said he saw a cell - phone video showing police " yanking a hijabi - wearing woman out of the crowd			2
" " she was very small			0
they turn her around and throw her down on the ground			0
" @entity47 said that 's when the crowd got very angry			0
" nobody was assaulted prior to the police being called , and that in itself is a problem , " @entity47 said			0
@entity27 said he was aware " there was some cell - phone footage and maybe some video , " " there 's no official video that we have released at this time , " he said			2
" there are some videos in the park that we 're retaining for our own information			2
" @entity27 said he had seen seen " bits and pieces " of phone footage from the incident			0

" " the women felt they were being targeted , but in fact these were safety precautions , " he said			1

" but @entity111 deputy commissioner @entity110 says the policy was made abundantly clear to the group 's organizer , and that the rules are clearly posted			0
" we repeatedly told him , because we knew this group would have religious headgear , " @entity110 insisted adding that a refund booth was set up in case anyone objected to the policy , which he said is posted prominently in the park			1
" there 's a sign at every ride , " @entity110 said			0
" when you enter the park , there 's a height line and it lists headgear policy			1
" what triggered the incident was fighting within the group and the subject was why they did n't know the policy , " said @entity110 , adding that he arrived at the scene about 20 minutes after the fight broke out			0
