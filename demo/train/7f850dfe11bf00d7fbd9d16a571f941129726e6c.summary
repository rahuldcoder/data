@entity8 , the president of the @entity9 , made the much - anticipated announcement in @entity11 on tuesday			0
" today is a special day for @entity13 football , " said @entity8			0
@entity1 , 48 , will be assisted by former @entity4 coach @entity14 , who will act as general manager			1
@entity1 's first match in charge wil be a friendly against @entity19 in @entity20 on november 19			1
he then faces a tougher task in making sure @entity4 qualify for the 2010 @entity23 finals from the @entity25 group			1
" it 's an honor , " @entity1 said			2
" it 's a dream come true			0
i 'm going to give it my all to make sure that things go well			0
we 're going to work everyday so that @entity4 has a national team that keeps getting better and better			1
" @entity1 wasted little time in stamping his authority in his new job , announcing that @entity35 's @entity34 would replace @entity36 as captain of the @entity4 side			1
" i want @entity34 to be my captain because i believe he is the @entity13 player who is closest to the idea i have about the @entity13 shirt -- sweat for it , sacrifice for it , being a professional , being close to the teammate , " he said			2
news of @entity1 's likely appointment broke last week after a meeting with @entity8 and in subsequent media interviews it became clear that he was going to take on the job			2
@entity1 told @entity49 that " my path is with the national team ... my path is to speak with the players , try to put together a solid group with @entity14			1
" i 'll put together the team , i 'll choose the players and i 'm sure @entity14 will take care of a ton of other things			2
" for me , this only compares to the birth of my two daughters " @entity62 and @entity63 , " he added			0
@entity1 's well - publicized off - field antics make him a controversial appointment , despite the hero worship status he enjoys in @entity4 after almost singlehandedly leading them to the 1986 @entity23 in @entity68			1
they were beaten four years later by hosts @entity71 in the 1990 final			0
@entity1 also played in the 1994 @entity23 in the @entity73 , but was sent home in disgrace after a positive drugs test			1
it was a sad end to a glittering career which saw him lead unfashionable @entity79 to two @entity81 titles			0
the world transfer record was broken when he joined @entity83 in 1982 and he went on to be regarded as perhaps the greatest footballer who ever played the game			0
@entity1 is best known for his two goals in the 2 - 1 victory over @entity88 in the quarterfinal of the 1986 @entity23			1
the first was the " @entity99 " goal when he punched the ball beyond goalkeeper @entity93 and the second was a " @entity99 " contender in the shape of a spectacular 60 - metre weave through six @entity88 players			0
critics say he is inexperienced in a coaching role , having failed in brief stints with @entity13 teams @entity103 and @entity105 during the mid- 90s , but @entity8 defended his appointment			0
" we have the security of excellence , " he said .			0
