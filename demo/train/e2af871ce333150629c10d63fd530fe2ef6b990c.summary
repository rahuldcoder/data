@entity0 -- @entity3 government ministers wednesday overwhelmingly approved a temporary freeze on settlement construction in the @entity6 in an effort to restart peace talks with the @entity9			1
the @entity10 voted 11 - 2 in favor of the measure which calls for a 10 - month freeze on new building permits and the construction of new residential buildings in the @entity6			1
@entity3 prime minister @entity17 called it " a very big step toward peace " and said he hoped the @entity9 would " take full advantage " of the opportunity to restart talks during the 10 - month window			1
" i hope the @entity9 and the @entity26 world will work with us to forge a new beginning ... for our children and for theirs , " he said			2
in @entity35 , the top @entity32 envoy for the region , @entity34 , said he hoped to use the time to begin negotiations on permanent status issues , which include security for @entity3 and @entity9 , borders , refugees and the status of @entity0			1
" my personal and fervent wish is that we will , during this process at some point , have a resolution of borders so there will no longer be any question about settlement construction , " @entity34 told reporters			1
" it falls short of a full settlement freeze , but it is more than any @entity3 government has done before , and can help move toward agreement between the parties , " @entity34 told a briefing at the @entity54			2
he said he plans to return soon to the region			0
@entity34 shrugged off a suggestion he might be discouraged after more than 10 months of failing to relaunch peace talks between @entity3 and @entity9			1
" you ca n't take as final the first ' no , ' the second ' no ' or even the hundredth ' no , ' " said @entity34 , who helped negotiate a peace agreement in @entity64 and was awarded the @entity65			0
" you ca n't get discouraged by setbacks and you ca n't be deterred by criticism			0
you have to be patient , persevering and determined			0
" @entity34 also released a statement from secretary of state @entity72 , which said the announcement helps move the issue forward			0
" we believe that through good - faith negotiations the parties can mutually agree on an outcome which ends the conflict and reconciles the @entity9 goal of an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines , with agreed swaps , and the @entity3 goal of a jewish state with secure and recognized borders that reflect subsequent developments and meet @entity3 security requirements , " the @entity77 statement said			1
" let me say to all the people of the region and world : our commitment to achieving a solution with two states living side by side in peace and security is unwavering , " the @entity77 statement added			0
former @entity103 prime minister @entity102 , a representative of the @entity104 made up of the @entity105 , the @entity32 , the @entity106 and the @entity107 , called the announcement " an important step towards creating the possibility for serious and credible negotiations for a two - state solution			2
" the key , as i have said consistently , is to combine a credible political negotiation with real change on the ground , in institution - building , security performance and economic development , " @entity102 said			2
but @entity120 , a member of the @entity121 from @entity17 's @entity122 and chairman of the @entity124 , opposed the announcement			0
" if the prime minister will implement the ideology of the left , he will not get the support of his own party , " he said			0
" all the things he wrote in his books , said in his speeches , he so eloquently preached for , he does exactly the opposite , " said @entity120 , calling the move a " disappointment			0
" @entity9 prime minister @entity138 said the proposed temporary freeze would be inadequate : " the exclusion of @entity0 is a very serious problem for us , " he told reporters on wednesday			1
@entity9 officials , including @entity138 , have called on @entity3 to freeze construction in @entity0 as well			1
the @entity9 want @entity0 to be the capital of a @entity9 state			2
in recent weeks , @entity17 and other members of his cabinet have made clear that a construction freeze would not be implemented in predominantly @entity26 @entity0			2
@entity3 views @entity0 as a separate issue to be hammered out in final status talks with the @entity9			1
the measure would not affect buildings already under construction for the existing @entity156 residents in the @entity6 , @entity17 said			0
construction of public building would also continue , government officials have said			0
the @entity3 government is under tremendous pressure -- particularly from its ally , the @entity32 -- to halt settlement construction in the @entity9 territory of the @entity6			1
continued construction has been a key stumbling block in restarting @entity3 - @entity9 peace talks			1
the @entity3 @entity10 is a subset of the larger @entity3 cabinet			2
it has historically been used by prime ministers to approve quick action on defense and diplomatic matters			0
@entity1 's @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report .			0
