-- @entity1 , daughter of the late sen. @entity2 and ex-wife of @entity5 gov. @entity4 , could take the witness stand wednesday morning to testify in her own defense in her @entity9 trial stemming from a 2012 traffic accident			1
@entity2 is facing a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated for allegedly swerving between lanes and careening into a tractor - trailer on a @entity15 , @entity5 , interstate in july of 2012			1
she drove away from the accident scene despite a shredded tire , and was found collapsed over the steering wheel of her @entity20 a short time later , according to testimony			1
@entity2 has said she swallowed a pill she believed to be her thyroid medication at around 7:30 the morning of the incident , but that she may have mixed up medicine bottles and taken zolpidem , a powerful sleep aid , instead			1
a blood test confirmed the presence of zolpidem in @entity2 's system , according to trial testimony this week			1
at the start of her defense case tuesday , @entity2 watched with a smile as her younger sister @entity39 described their close relationship			2
" she 's really my best friend , " said the younger @entity2 on the stand			2
when asked about her sister 's reputation for truthfulness , she said , " she wrote the book called ' @entity48 ' about her commitment to justice and truth , and that 's what she has devoted her life to			0
" trial opens with video of sobriety tests , claim of ' sleep driving ' a growing group of supporters have sat in the rows behind the defendant throughout the two trial days in @entity15 , including sister @entity64 , brothers @entity65 and @entity67 , and 85 - year - old family matriarch @entity68			1
earlier tuesday , jurors heard from @entity70 , a drug - detection specialist with the @entity72 who evaluated @entity2 after the crash			2
some three hours after she allegedly failed three roadside sobriety tests , @entity2 passed those same tests with flying colors , testified @entity70			2
finding no signs of intoxication , @entity70 instead began to suspect that @entity2 's car accident and disoriented state had been the result of a medical condition , he said			1
@entity2 herself was also worried , and asked that a vial of the blood drawn from her at @entity89 , said @entity70 : " she was concerned and she wanted to know what happened to her			2
" @entity2 remained at the hospital overnight for observation			0
during opening statements monday , assistant district attorney @entity94 said that even if @entity2 , 54 , had taken the sleep aid unintentionally , she had a responsibility to pull her vehicle off the road safely when she began to feel its effects			1
defense attorney @entity102 disputed that argument , saying @entity2 had no time to react			0
" the zolpidem kicks in , it shuts her down , she 's in a state of ' sleep driving , ' " he said			0
tuesday afternoon , jurors watched another member of @entity2 's defense team spar with an expert witness about the effects of the drug			0
laboratory director @entity114 conceded that zolpidem is " a very potent , fast - acting hypnotic , " that begins to hamper cognitive ability and motor skills within 15 - 45 minutes			0
its effect on @entity1 would have peaked at around 9 a.m. , testified @entity120 ; roughly the time @entity2 failed an initial round of sobriety tests by police after a motorist called 911			1
@entity120 was asked by prosecutor @entity125 whether zolpidem is a " knock - out pill , " and replied that the drug would need time to enter the blood stream and brain before it takes full effect			0
" and , prior to the time the drug takes effect , does a person still have brain function ? do they still have decision - making ability ? " asked @entity135			0
" yes , " replied @entity120			0
the trial continues wednesday at 9:30 a.m.			0
