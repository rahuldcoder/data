-- consider it an occupational hazard			0
work at a veterinary clinic long enough , and eventually you will wind up falling for a patient			2
in the case of veterinary technician @entity8 , she fell for a patient that had been left behind at her roommate 's veterinary clinic			1
@entity14 's owner surrendered the dog because the animal could no longer use her hind legs			2
after hearing about @entity14 , @entity8 offered to try laser therapy			1
the procedure promotes healing at the cellular level by increasing blood flow and decreasing inflammation in the injured area , and had been used successfully by @entity8 's colleagues at @entity26 's @entity25 in @entity27			1
@entity8 was so sure laser therapy would work that she took responsibility for the perky pooch , renaming her @entity31			1
" i wanted to try to get her walking again with the laser , " she says			0
" i was hopeful i could do that and adopt her out , but once it became clear she was n't going to walk again , it became difficult			0
" by that point , she had fallen for @entity31			0
but with a roommate and a house full of pets , @entity8 had no room for another addition			1
the vet tech decided the next best thing to taking @entity31 home was to move to @entity49 : build a wheelchair so the dog could get around and — hopefully — find a forever home			1
@entity0 : more amazing advances in veterinary medicine how do you build a wheelchair for a dog ? for @entity8 , it was time to surf the @entity59 and reach out to her friends			1
firefighter @entity61 , whose wife works with @entity8 , downloaded instructions to transform 1 - inch pvc pipe , foam insulation and a pair of lawn mower wheels into @entity31 's new ride			1
@entity26 's @entity25 paid for the supplies and , a few hours later , @entity61 was fitting the dog for her new wheelchair			1
the first ride was a bit bumpy and required some adjustments , but soon @entity31 was off in pursuit of a stuffed toy			0
fortunately for @entity31 and other dogs with disabilities , there is no shortage of information to help people care for animals with special needs			2
on @entity86 , pet owners offer advice , purchase gear and share words of encouragement			2
customers regularly submit video footage of their dogs thriving , and the site 's @entity95 fan page has more than 48,000 members			0
it was created in 2000 by @entity99 , who had sold pet supplies and wheelchairs for years			2
" people who were caring for disabled animals were feeling very alone and neglected , " says @entity99			1
" friends and neighbors would say , ' aww , put the poor thing to sleep , ' but these people knew their dog was alive , awake , happy — they just could n't walk			0
they had nowhere to go for support			0
" @entity0 : dogs get decked out for ' howl - o - ween ' community feedback led @entity99 to invent the @entity114 wheels adjustable wheelchair , which is available in 22 countries , including @entity116 , @entity117 and — coming soon — @entity118			1
a mini version accommodates dogs that weigh less than 20 pounds and ranges from $ 249 to $ 325 , while the standard version works for dogs up to 180 pounds			0
prices range from $ 399 to $ 529			0
upon hearing @entity31 's story , @entity125 offered @entity8 a travel - friendly @entity114 wheels to keep @entity31 moving in the right direction			1
now , all @entity31 needs is a forever home			0
@entity129 has agreed to board her until @entity8 finds the right family , one that can handle the challenges of a pet with special needs			1
in the meantime , @entity31 is adjusting to her new wheels			0
" it 's hard to keep up with [ @entity31 ] when she makes up her mind , " @entity8 says			2
" her front end is all muscle so she 's a great candidate for a wheelchair			0
" if you are interested in providing a forever home for @entity31 , please email info@soulpup.com			0
