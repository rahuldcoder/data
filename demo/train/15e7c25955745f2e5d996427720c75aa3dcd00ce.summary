-- ebola virus disease is sweeping across @entity2 in the largest outbreak of the virus to date			0
mortality rates are currently at 60 % in a disease where up to 90 % of infected people can die			0
but despite this lethality there remain no licensed treatments or vaccines available , nearly 40 years after the disease was first discovered			1
in march , @entity13 was reported for the first time in @entity15 , @entity2 , in districts that border neighboring @entity17 and @entity18			2
this proximity meant that unlike previous outbreaks in other parts of @entity2 , the usually remote ebola virus had the opportunity to cross borders			0
with residents migrating back and forth , it did just that			0
four months later the outbreak has reached unprecedented scales , with 1,093 people infected and 660 deaths attributed to the virus			0
" this is clearly an outbreak across international borders and it has not been handled properly , " explains @entity33 , professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) , who was on - site at the first human @entity13 outbreak in 1976			1
he says the 24 known outbreaks of @entity13 to date have shown that it should be easily controlled			2
" it 's not rocket science to control these outbreaks but instead basic epidemiology : infection control , hygiene practices , contact - tracing and safe burial practices , " says @entity33 of the virus , which is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids			0
" @entity13 is its own worst enemy , it 's too lethal and can not sustain its own spread			2
" but whilst it should be easily contained , this time something has gone wrong			0
the @entity15 and @entity17 capital cities were reached exposing many more to the virus and making those infected and their contacts harder to trace and isolate			0
the outbreak has been described as " out of control " by @entity63 -- so why is there no other approach ? opinion : why @entity13 epidemic is spinning out of control the usual response in disease outbreaks is to use drugs to treat those infected and stop them transmitting to others , in combination with vaccines that protect those exposed and slow down , or halt , the spread of a virus through a population by enabling herd immunity			1
but there are no licensed drugs or vaccines for use against @entity13 as its periodic , remote and usually small - scale nature means there has not been a big enough market , nor the ability to conduct large - scale trials in humans exposed to the disease			1
the biology of the virus also makes it challenging to develop vaccines that create a strong enough immune response ; the occurrence of multiple forms of the virus means an immune response is needed against all of them , and @entity13 's ability to replicate rapidly means it could equally rapidly evolve resistance to the vaccine			1
despite these challenges , there are vaccines being developed by a range of organizations , including the vaccine research center at the @entity114 @entity113 ( @entity113 ) -- and some argue that an outbreak is the perfect time to trial them			1
" it would be unethical not to acknowledge that potential new treatments could both save lives and reduce transmission in this and future outbreaks , " says dr @entity120 , director of global charitable foundation the @entity121			0
@entity120 has recently called for new approaches to be used in controlling the outbreak as no other opportunity will enable the further development of new treatments or vaccines			1
" any new intervention must have preclinical safety and efficacy data and @entity141 safety data in healthy volunteers , " he says describing the slow progression of phases involved in pharmaceutical development , " but ultimately there can be no @entity144 ( vaccine efficacy ) data in @entity13 other than that acquired during an epidemic			1
" @entity149 , director of the @entity35 , who co-discovered @entity13 during its first outbreak , agrees with @entity120			1
" in general i believe that this continuing outbreak is a rare opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of experimental drugs , " he says , but stresses , " as long as all ethical standards are respected , and as long as it does not create more problems for controlling the outbreak , since medical experiments may decrease even more trust in health authorities and add to hostility to healthcare workers			1
" @entity149 is referring to resistance from affected communities towards healthcare workers and health officials who enter their villages dressed in astronaut - like quarantine clothing and ask them to change their cultural practices such as burials , where the traditional cleaning of bodies puts those mourning at risk of transmission			1
long - standing mistrust exists towards governments and ministries of health , leading to healthcare staff having rocks thrown at them , being threatened by machetes and facing general aggression , according to a @entity187 ( @entity187 ) spokesperson			2
tensions between those controlling the outbreak and those affected by it mean trialling vaccines in outbreak communities is not supported by @entity187 officials on the ground			2
" using an experimental vaccine on human beings in the middle of an outbreak in this case would not be ethical , feasible , or wise , " according to the @entity187			2
but there remain other avenues			0
" the vaccines are likely safe and effective but are n't used by public health teams and they wo n't use them without adequate trials , " explains dr @entity205 , from the @entity206 , who is developing vaccines for use in non-human primates such as chimpanzees and gorillas who are also victims of the virus			0
@entity220 's vaccines have shown a good immune response when trialled in chimpanzees and he suggests trialling human vaccines incrementally in healthcare workers rather than the mass population			1
" healthcare workers are at the greatest risk and are hubs of infection who are likely to spread it to others , " he says			1
" the risk of dying from the vaccine is tiny compared to dying from @entity13 and unlike communities , healthcare workers would understand the risks better and should be able to give informed consent			1
" this approach is supported by the @entity113 , whose ebola vaccine programs have progressed the furthest			0
" we are supporting a number of vaccines and they are all in a roughly similar position and getting ready for @entity141 trials for safety , " says dr @entity241 , director of their @entity242 and @entity244			0
" if these make it through testing what we 're likely to see in future outbreaks is healthcare workers and outbreak investigators taking the vaccine under informed consent , " @entity241 explains			1
" working with those at the highest risk will enable you to see if the vaccine has an impact			2
" it is too late in this outbreak for vaccines to have enough of a preventative impact , but @entity13 will emerge again in the future			1
if safety can be proven , the stockpiling of vaccines could improve the outcome of future outbreaks			0
" vaccines enable a preparative framework to be established rather than a reactive one , " explains @entity33			0
" but firstly it must be shown to be safe in humans			0
" the ability to control future epidemics may depend on it			0
opinion : why @entity13 epidemic is spinning out of control			2

40 years after its discovery , there are no licensed treatments or vaccines for @entity13
ethically , a vaccine for @entity13 can only be trialled for effectiveness during an outbreak
vaccines are better trialled in high - risk groups , including healthcare workers , say experts
