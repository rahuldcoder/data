-- " @entity0 and big booties , y'all			0
that 's what life is about , " professes @entity4 , the be-grilled , white @entity6 - driving rapper played by @entity7 in @entity9 's " @entity8 " ( in theaters friday )			1
add baby - pink ski masks and more than a little gunplay to the mix , and we 're off			0
the art - sleaze film about the decadent rites of @entity21 college kids stars former @entity23 sweethearts @entity22 and @entity24 alongside " @entity25 ' " @entity26 and @entity9 's wife , @entity27 , as broke coeds who stick up a chicken shack to fund the spring break of their dreams			1
when the partying goes too far and the girls find themselves in jail in @entity38 , @entity39 , it 's @entity4 who bails them out and introduces them to a life that 's both darker and more tender than they ever knew			1
the @entity45 - and dubstep - fueled assault on the senses was written by @entity9 ( " kids , " " @entity48 " ) while doing some immersion research in a hotel room in @entity51 , @entity39 , where , he told an audience at the @entity54 in @entity55 , " people were blasting @entity58 music 24 hours a day , vomiting on my door and snorting donuts			1
" " it 's a very base culture , " he continued , " and i thought there was some kind of strange poetry in it as well			1
" the scenes of spring break , raunchy displays of grinding bodies and guys spilling beer into topless girls ' mouths from crotch level , were taken from real - life festivities			1
" some of the scenes we were shooting , and you see we 're in the motel room , and all of us are just completely covering our mouths and shocked -- that was all real , " @entity77 said			1
" we were witnessing things that were happening that were absolutely crazy and reacting in the realest way			0
" " the images were hypersexualized , hyperviolent , " @entity9 said , " and then the subject matter was all the details : the bikinis and the book bags and the flip - flops and the @entity95 bags and the nail polish and the neons and the stickers and the glasses were all real childlike , innocent			2
i thought it was interesting , both of those things working together			0
it 's a nice backdrop but also a metaphor for what happens later in the film once they meet @entity4 and what the movie becomes			2
" @entity111 , @entity77 's comparatively pious character , scans as someone who might have grown out of the " @entity114 " and @entity116 trajectory , she explained that she chose the role because " i wanted to see how far i could go			1
" @entity26 said , " people are used to seeing us in certain roles , and this was a movie where we were able to show people a different side of us , and it was more exciting than anything			0
" @entity24 added that their characters are " a little bit psychotic in their own right , but it 's such a liberating experience to be able to do a movie like this			1
" but , @entity77 cautioned , " i do n't necessarily want to know what people are going to say or think " about her choice			2
" it 's just better that way			2
i ca n't really make anyone happy			0
i 'm an actor , and i love what i do , so if i want to do something i 'm super passionate about , i 'm just going to go for it			0
if people like it , awesome			0
if not , at least we made them feel something			0
