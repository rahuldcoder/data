" that 's why we have to be determined to stop these crimes			0
because they have no place in the greatest military on @entity27 , " @entity1 continued			1
the president 's remarks came amid mounting outrage over sexual abuse cases in the armed forces			1
figures show the rate of assaults in the armed forced increasing , and some top officers are under fire for condoning such acts			1
at least two officers responsible for preventing sexual assault are under investigation for allegedly committing the types of act they were tasked with stopping			1
those factors have led to calls for major changes in how the armed forces handle sexual assaults			1
@entity1 has demanded his top military brass " leave no stone overturned " in their quest to prevent abuse , and members of @entity51 have introduced legislation that would make it easier for victims to get justice			1
in his commencement address friday , @entity1 characterized the @entity6 military as one of the few institutions @entity6 still trust , but said incidents like sexual assaults , as well as other delinquency by servicemen in the field , could erode that faith			1
" even in our military , we 've seen how the misconduct of some can have effects that ripple far and wide			2
in our digital age , a single image from the battlefield of troops falling short of their standards can go viral and endanger our forces and undermine our efforts to achieve security and peace , " @entity1 told the @entity9 graduates , 206 of whom were women			1
earlier this month , the @entity85 released figures estimating 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact occurred in 2012 , a 35 % jump from 2010			2
those cases ranged from groping to rape			0
the vast majority of those incidents went unreported as crimes , the study showed			0
meanwhile , officers at bases across the country are under investigation for allegedly committing sexual assaults			1
an @entity102 sergeant first class assigned to the sexual assault prevention unit at @entity104 , @entity105 , came under investigation in early may for alleged sexual assault , pandering , abusive sexual contact and maltreatment of subordinates			2
the military said he 's been relieved of duty while investigators look in to the allegations			2
also in may , an @entity116 officer who managed an assault prevention unit was charged with sexual battery and removed from duty			0
he is accused of grabbing a woman and groping her buttocks and breasts in an @entity124 parking lot not far from his @entity126 office			0
and this week , the @entity102 said it had suspended @entity128			0
gen. @entity129 , the top general at @entity130 in @entity131 , due to allegations of adultery and assault			0
@entity130 is where most new @entity102 recruits go through basic training , which includes training about sexual assault prevention			0
the president traditionally delivers the commencement address at one of the military service academies every year			2

the last time he delivered the commencement in @entity147 was 2009			0
vice president @entity148 spoke last weekend at the @entity149 in @entity150			0
defense secretary @entity151 will speak saturday at the @entity152 at @entity152 , and also will address sexual assaults , according to a @entity6 official			2
@entity1 's remarks came the day after a much - anticipated speech in which the president spelled out a new phase of @entity6 's war on terror			1
he told the new officers friday they are entering a military vastly changed from four years ago			1
" just as you have changed in the past four years , so too have the challenges facing our military , " he said , noting the wars in @entity164 and @entity165 were still being engaged when friday 's graduates entered the academy			0
" even as we move beyond deploying our large ground armies abroad , we need to conduct precise targeted strikes against terrorists before they kill our citizens , " @entity1 said			2
" even as we stay vigilant in the face of terrorism , and stay true to our @entity178 and values , we need to stay ready for the full range of threats			0
" @entity0 's @entity182 contributed to this report .			0
