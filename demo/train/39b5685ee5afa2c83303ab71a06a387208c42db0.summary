@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's 4 o'clock on a sunday morning when a trail of figures dressed in white emerges from the deep darkness			1
quietly , the summoned crowd makes its way down a cluster of ancient structures as the slow beat from traditional skin drums beckons			0
it 's a common scene here in @entity0 , a small town in northern @entity1 that 's home to 11 spectacular churches carved both inside and out from a single rock some 900 years ago			1
the chiseled creations have turned this mountain town into a place of pride and pilgrimage for worshipers of the @entity26 , attracting 80,000 to 100,000 visitors every year			1
" it is one of the very important places for the @entity1 @entity26 people , " says local guide @entity28 , who 's lived here most of his life			2
" there is a belief that @entity0 pilgrims share the same blessing as pilgrims to @entity40 , " he explains			2
" they have to come at least once in a lifetime			0
" and they come from all over			0
even though @entity0 sits in a remote region of @entity1 , the faithful will walk for days , even weeks , to get here , many of them traversing the rugged mountains barefoot			1
amongst them , blind men and women and people with disabilities also join the pilgrimage , making their way along @entity0 's winding , hilly roads to reach the sacred site			1
" what makes the @entity0 churches important is that they are still in use , " says @entity28			1
" it 's not a museum ; it 's a living heritage			0
every day , every morning , there is a service in all the churches			2
" brimming with spirituality @entity1 is home to one of the oldest @entity71 churches in the world , dating back to the early fourth century			1
the @entity1 @entity26 used to be a part of @entity75 's @entity74 , but established its own patriarch in 1959			2
today , nearly two thirds of the @entity80 country 's population is @entity71 , with most belonging to the @entity26			0
read this : will @entity80 coins rewrite @entity84 history ? nowhere does the spirituality of the church 's followers echo louder than in @entity0			2
the town is brimming with devotion ; throughout the churches ' compound , you 'll find worshipers leaning against the structures , kissing the age - old rock walls , praying quietly or reading religious texts			1
" they come early to get the blessing -- because it 's such a big deal , every inch of the place is packed , " says @entity97 , the priest who presides over all the churches in @entity0			1
" people are so happy with the blessings they get here , they come here without any prompting and spend their nights and days at the church			0
" distinctive monuments the medieval structures were commissioned by @entity0 , of the @entity111 , which ruled much of the country back in the 12th century			2
there are several stories surrounding the creation of the churches , one of which says that humans worked during the day and angels would speed up the building overnight			2
some historians say construction was completed at a remarkable pace , taking about 23 years			2
watch this : why do @entity126 love @entity1 ? carved out of volcanic tuff rock , the famous churches have been built in a variety of styles			1
some of them were chiseled into the face of the rock , where others stand as isolated blocks , like the iconic church of @entity137 , constructed in the shape of the cross			2
a complex and extensive system of drainage ditches , tunnels and subterranean passageways connects the underground structures			0
@entity146 , an 86 - year - old church scholar who has studied in some of @entity1 's holiest cities , explains what makes these churches so distinctive			1
" they are different because they were built from the top down , " he says			0
" everywhere in the world , structures are built from the ground up , " he adds			0
" there is nothing comparable in the world			0
" living legacy thanks to their impressive architecture and rich influence on @entity1 christianity , the churches have been a @entity165 since 1978			1
five years ago , @entity166 decided to erect protective coverings to shield four of the churches from the elements			1
the shelters may be unsightly , but experts say they are critical to preserving the integrity of the churches			0
in recent years , a conscious effort to develop @entity0 's infrastructure has also brought further attention to this remote place , leading to the arrival of even more pilgrims and tourists			1
@entity181 says he 's seen positive changes in @entity0 over the years			1
he says he 's especially content with how it 's become a worldwide tourist destination			0
" one , because the country 's culture should be shown , and secondly , many poor people in the area are being helped , " he says			0
" everyone is making a living through the tourism business			0
it 's great ; without the tourists , there is no salary for anyone			0
if the tourists stopped , everything will stop			0
" but that does n't seem likely , as visitors keep on coming to @entity0 's churches			1
and although the sacred sites provide a solid foundation for the faithful , it 's the followers themselves that ultimately breathe life into these ancient rock walls .			0
