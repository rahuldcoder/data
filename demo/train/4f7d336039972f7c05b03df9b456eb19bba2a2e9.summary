@entity0 -- the day of the @entity9 mea culpa last week , an @entity3 friend of mine , whom we can call @entity7 , drove from @entity10 to his native village			1
a group of @entity13 stopped the car and demanded to search @entity7 and his companions			1
this search has become a fact of life since the movement re-established its control over villages in @entity22 , a district in @entity10 province			0
the head of the armed group was the 20 - year - old son of @entity7 's tenant farmer			0
not far below a superficial politeness , the young @entity13 fighter deliberately humiliated someone who , according to @entity32 norms , was his senior			1
new - generation fighters like the tenant tend to be from the poorer families in their tribes , have little education , have no property and have never held a paying job			2
the @entity40 and motorcycle that come with being a @entity13 commander and the moral authority of claiming to be waging a jihad have empowered these tribal outsiders			1
ironically , a decade ago , @entity7 was a senior leader in the original @entity13 movement and commanded hundreds of such young men			1
one of the main themes of the counterinsurgency ( @entity52 ) strategy is a " population focus			1
" a district like the one where @entity7 lives is today densely populated , unlike during the @entity58 occupation			0
it sits astride a national highway and is a gateway to @entity10			0
it is therefore prioritized as " key terrain			2
" according to the " shape - clear - hold - build " @entity52 mantra , @entity64 is supposed to expel insurgents from @entity7 's district and 59 other priority areas			1
it is supposed to help install @entity3 civil administration and security forces and leave them to maintain security and practically assist the population			1
to make this possible , @entity3 security force numbers are to be raised to 400,000 and @entity3 government legitimacy , responsiveness and accountability are to be boosted			1
unfortunately , none of this is going to happen by 2011			2
success requires more time and political action than backers have been prepared to contemplate			2
@entity7 's encounter with his tenant @entity13 gives a clue to the steady supply of insurgent fighters and commanders			1
insurgency has become their social niche			2
@entity13 fighters keep on popping up , making good their losses and adapting to the @entity95 campaign			1
more global perspectives , images , videos and the latest news at the @entity101 blog in the face of a resilient insurgency , @entity103 and @entity3 timelines do not match			1
the @entity103 will review progress against its strategy in late 2010			0
but at the end of the year , @entity101 will look pretty much the same as last year , before the surge			0
the challenge in dealing with the @entity3 government is to encourage the good and forbid the evil			1
but current strategy contains no silver bullets for delivering a government that the population might consider trustworthy or legitimate			2
increased awareness of the problems with a " kleptocratic " government has not translated into effective measures to clean it up			1
moreover , the insurgency is now self - sustaining			2
enough protection money leaks from transport , security and construction contracts to finance thousands of the kind of group that stopped @entity7			0
meanwhile , the @entity103 has also found it very difficult to support the government in a way that delivers resources and backup to administrators and officers on the ground			0
another challenge , which is more political than military , is that the insurgents are still able to exploit @entity140 as a haven			0
groups like the one that stopped @entity7 alternate between the battlefield and the haven in @entity148 , only eight hours away			0
what can be done ? the first challenge is to get the @entity3 leadership and the international allies onto the same script			1
for example , the @entity3 leadership insists on holding parliamentary elections in september , even though everyone else knows they would be disastrous for the counterinsurgency objective of boosting government legitimacy			1
an election held in conditions in which half of the polling station locations are too dangerous for candidate agents , and indeed voters , to visit is likely to lead to another round of rigging and disputes , undermining the credibility of the parliament			0
this is the kind of disconnect that needs to be overcome			0
likewise , reconciliation with the amenable parts of the insurgency will have to be elevated from the status of show or strategic afterthought to become a serious part of the strategy			2
the strategy will also require some bright new ideas for getting @entity140 on board			0
a more realistic strategy would have the work of securing much of the key terrain eventually fall to the @entity189			0
before the phased hand - over , @entity64 will secure main cities but probably only a handful of the current prioritized districts			0
if the @entity103 leadership decides to stay engaged , there will have to be a switch to a longer - term post-surge support strategy with more modest objectives , such as securing the cities and main highways rather than all population centers			0
renewed @entity103 commitment will generate opportunities to convince some of the insurgent leadership that they have no prospect of toppling the @entity207 government and might as well strike a deal			0
in the best of all possible counterinsurgency worlds , the @entity13 leadership would abandon @entity212 and declare its armed jihad over			1
however , there is little prospect of anyone signing up to such a deal as long as thousands of fighters expect to ride out a time - limited surge , flitting between @entity22 and @entity148			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			2

@entity222 says new crop of @entity3 @entity13 made bold by guns , jihad authority
forces face this constant supply of fighters , he says , as well as kleptocratic government
he says @entity52 goals of forming government and security forces wo *n't* be reached by 2011
@entity239 : making common cause with *reasonable* parts of insurgency key to success
