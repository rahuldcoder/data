-- the @entity2 does not know where ousted @entity4 leader @entity3 is and does not believe the @entity6 has a lock on his whereabouts either , a senior @entity2 official told @entity0 thursday			1
that information came after @entity10 , a spokesman for the new @entity11 , said @entity13 fighters had cornered the fallen @entity4 leader and that he had no means of escape			1
@entity17 did not divulge a location			0
@entity2 defense secretary @entity19 said earlier this week that officials believe @entity3 is on the run			1
" i do n't have any information as to exactly where he 's located , " he said			0
two @entity4 convoys passed through @entity28 this week , officials in that country said			2
initial speculation was that @entity3 was in one of those groups , but on thursday a second senior @entity2 official said the @entity2 now has a list of officials from @entity4 who were in both convoys			1
there were " no marquee names , " or anyone who was named in @entity41 resolutions , the second source said			0
the official would not say who was in the convoys but said @entity3 's security chief was not among them , refuting reports that said he left in the convoy			1
the @entity28 government is talking to the @entity6 about what the new @entity4 leadership wants to do with those in the convoy but the @entity6 has n't decided whether it 's worth it to bring them back , the source said			1
@entity4 are leading the search for @entity3			1
the @entity57 has agents in the area , and the @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 have special forces in the country as well , @entity67 and @entity2 defense officials tell @entity0			2
however , the mission of those agents is not necessarily focused on hunting for @entity3			1
in @entity72 , capt. @entity70 , spokesman for the @entity71 , insisted thursday that the @entity2 mission in @entity4 is to protect citizens and " is not about capturing or finding col. @entity3			1
" questions about @entity3 's whereabouts intensified after the fall of @entity78 and reports that his wife , daughter , two sons and other family members fled to neighboring @entity83 , which described its acceptance of the family as a humanitarian gesture			2
@entity3 's forces in @entity88 , one of the last loyalist strongholds , fired grad rockets at opposition fighters thursday , according to the @entity6 chief negotiator for the city , @entity95			1
he said the rockets were fired randomly and no fighters were injured			2
" @entity3 loyalists are just trying to scare rebel ranks with the grad explosions and booms , " @entity98 said			1
opposition fighers are advancing on @entity88 from two directions , according to @entity98			1
he also said opposition supporters inside the city attacked some of @entity3 's military installations , capturing and destroying artillery and rocket launchers			1
@entity88 is about 150 kilometers ( some 90 miles ) southeast of @entity78			2
meantime , @entity6 leader @entity112 told reporters that @entity4 have a choice between the past and the future			1
he warned that the " battle for freedom " was not over , especially in the southern part of the country			0
he also said that the " national confidence which aimed at bringing the regime down has not been achieved yet			0
" but @entity112 was confident the battle would be won if @entity4 remained united			2
" and when the battle 's really finished ... there will be an interim government and also a constitution which has been agreed			0
" " my priorities are to finish the freedom , the fight of freedom , " @entity112 continued , " and to form a civil state and a democratic government -- regardless of the side or color they have to participate equally in all rights and duties			0
also thursday , the @entity137 asked @entity138 to issue @entity140 arrest warrants for the fallen @entity4 leader , wanted for alleged crimes against humanity			1
" arresting @entity3 is matter of time , " said @entity144 , the chief prosecutor for the @entity137 in @entity145 , @entity146			2
a red notice allows @entity138 , the international police agency , to widely circulate arrest warrants with an intention to extradite suspects to the criminal court			0
the @entity137 also asked for @entity153 on @entity3 's son , @entity154 , and his brother - in - law , @entity155 , who served as the regime 's intelligence chief			2
they are also wanted for alleged killings and persecution in the @entity4 uprising that erupted in february			2
@entity154 is believed to be in @entity161 , one of the last @entity164 strongholds in @entity4 , said the first senior @entity2 official			1
in addition , that official said another son in is believed to be in @entity88			1
a third son , @entity168 , is believed to be in a town whose name is not a familiar one , the official said			0
the official did not have the town 's name and could not immediately remember it			0
earlier , @entity98 said two of @entity3 's sons had been spotted in @entity88			1
" we know that @entity154 and @entity177 are inside @entity88 , " @entity98 said			2
" eyewitnesses we know by name inside @entity88 told us they saw them			2
" @entity154 was considered the most influential of @entity3 's sons			2
@entity177 served as his father 's national security adviser			0
two other sons , @entity184 and @entity185 , are believed to be dead			0
@entity0 could not independently confirm any of the interim council 's statements			0
anti-gadhafi fighters have made claims before about the arrests or killings of @entity3 's sons which later were proved false			1
@entity3 has not been seen in public in months			2
in recent days , a @entity194 television station has aired several messages allegedly from @entity3			2
" @entity197 himself incited violence against our peaceful message in a message broadcast on @entity203 , " @entity6 member @entity98 said , referring to an audio message purportedly from @entity3 aired wednesday			1
" he asked his supporters to destroy the mosque where the negotiations with @entity88 elders took place , " @entity98 said			2
@entity70 , the @entity71 spokesman , told journalists at @entity212 briefing that the @entity2 believes @entity3 forces are still a danger and some troops continue to be loyal to the @entity4 leader			1
neither @entity70 nor @entity217 , the new @entity212 spokesman who appeared with @entity70 at the briefing , would comment on recent reports by @entity0 and others of shoulder - fired missiles and other weapons being looted from @entity4 storage facilities , but @entity70 did say the @entity2 has told the @entity6 it needs to get control of the various weapons stashes around the country			1
@entity217 also said the @entity2 remains confident that chemical weapons material in @entity4 remains secure and said the material has been under constant watch for months			1
after the news reports about the looted weapons , the @entity230 administration again contacted members of the @entity234 to express their concern about those weapons getting into the hands of @entity2 adversaries , according to a senior @entity2 official			1
two senior @entity241 officials confirmed that the @entity241 has intensified outreach to the @entity234 in the past few days , based on several reports about the missing weapons			0
" we do n't know who grabbed them or where they are , " the senior @entity2 official said of the missing weapons			1
" we are deeply concerned they are all accounted for			0
we are hoping the @entity234 will do what needs to be done			0
" the official pointed out that the @entity2 was concerned about @entity4 surface - to - air missiles getting into the wrong hands even during the @entity3 regime			1
it 's also understood that some rebel forces broke into government warehouses in the early days of the conflict to arms themselves			0
the concern now is weapons that have been seized by loyalist fighters or that could have been sold to members of terrorists such as @entity268 operatives in @entity269			0
a @entity67 source told @entity0 that the alliance believes some weapons have " gotten out " either to loyalists forces or other adversaries outside @entity4			1
but he emphasized the alliance has " no idea of the quantity or even whether they 're operational			0
" a key issue is whether any of the missing weapons also have functioning battery power assemblies and firing mechanisms			0
he emphasized that @entity67 also has regularly talked to the @entity234 about the problem			0
@entity4 's new leaders , meanwhile , have imposed a saturday deadline on @entity3 loyalists to lay down their arms or face military force			1
the calm that prevailed during negotiations for surrender shattered in @entity88 thursday as loyalists fired on advancing opposition fighters			1
the @entity13 fighters were on a reconnaissance mission when they came under fire in @entity296 , about 15 kilometers ( 9 miles ) outside @entity88 , @entity98 said			1
one opposition fighter was injured in the abdomen , he said			0
the opposition returned fire and killed a @entity302 fighter			2
meanwhile , trucks armed with anti-aircraft guns and rocket launchers pulled into a base 30 kilometers ( nearly 20 miles ) southwest of the coastal city of @entity307 wednesday			0
the fighting force known as the @entity309 was back from its patrol of the desert landscape separating @entity88 and @entity307 , loyal to the @entity6			1
the 70 - kilometer ( 44 - mile ) buffer zone had been quiet for the past two weeks amid negotiations between tribal leaders from @entity88 and representatives from the @entity6			1
" we do n't want more bloodshed , " said @entity316 , the commander of the @entity309			0
" too many people have died , so we hope the negotiations will be successful			0
" @entity316 's forces are battle - hardened from months of heavy fighting , and with @entity3 's forces against the ropes , he said the battle to take the city will be short			0
" if we are ordered to take the city , it wo n't take us long , maybe two or three hours , " @entity316 said			0
many soldiers on the front hope for a peaceful solution			0
but as saturday 's deadline loomed , many were anxious as hope of success began to fade			0
" negotiations have completely failed , " said @entity336 , an @entity6 spokesman			0
" we wo n't agree to their demands			0
" these demands include @entity6 forces entering the city unarmed , refraining from searching houses and -- the most contentious -- a full pardon for the people of @entity88			1
" we wo n't grant amnesty because there are people with blood on their hands , and we want them to face a trial , " @entity336 said			0
" i predict fighting to resume on saturday			0
" @entity0 's @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 , @entity356 and journalist @entity357 contributed to this report .			0
