-- for the millions of us who sit at desks all day , @entity2 's description of her workplace might sound a little cruel			1
" the water is my office and yeah , i get to spend almost every day in the ocean , and that 's tremendous , " @entity2 told @entity0 's human to @entity8			1
a place that conjures up an image of air - conditioned confinement to most means nothing but fresh air and freedom to the @entity20 surfer			1
" i just love riding a wave			0
i love getting up early in the morning and driving down to the beach and paddling out and every time i go out , i 'm looking for that perfect wave , " she explains			0
" when you 're out there and you find that one that you want to go for , it 's just like everything else in the world disappears			1
" it 's just you and the ocean and just spontaneity and an expression of yourself			2
there 's not really any thinking involved , it 's just doing			2
" admittedly , it may not be the most original statement ever uttered by a surfer , but @entity2 's career so far has been anything but derivative			1
carving up the field the 22 - year - old has taken the surfing world by storm in recent years , winning the women 's world championship twice in the last four seasons			1
her first world crown was not only a personal triumph but a significant landmark for the sport as she clinched the title at the age of 18 to become the youngest - ever female world champion			1
" my first world title in 2011 was a dream come true			1
i mean , i dreamed of it my entire life and so for it to finally pay off was the best thing ever , " she says			0
" i never really thought of myself being the youngest person			2
i really do n't look back and think , ' oh ! that was such an accomplishment ! ' i think it was more just like , ' yeah , i won a world title and that really meant something			2
' in a way it was nothing more than surfing aficionados had expected given her incredible progression as a junior			0
@entity2 was born in @entity75 , on @entity77 's third biggest island , @entity78 -- home to some of the world 's most hallowed surf			1
" not only are the people so sweet , amazing and welcoming -- there 's so much " aloha " -- but the waves are perfect for growing up as a surfer , " she says			2
@entity78 's 110 miles of coastline is dotted with spectacular surfing spots from the vertiginous waves of @entity91 on the north shore to @entity93			2
it was here , in the more benign waters in the south of the island , that @entity2 's father introduced her to the sport			1
" my dad actually was a very serious water man			0
he swam , he paddleboard raced , he did all sorts of things in the water , " she says			0
" he was the first one who introduced me to surfing and pushed me into my first wave when i was about four or five years old at @entity93			0
it was n't too serious in the beginning -- it was just us enjoying the ocean together			0
" making waves by the time she was 10 , @entity2 was an experienced competitor and already dreaming big			2
" i remember telling my dad : ' hey , you know , i think i want to be the best that i can be in this sport			0
i want to see how far i can go , ' " she recalls			0
in 2004 , aged 11 , @entity2 won the first of a record 11 national titles in events organized by the @entity118 , the premier amateur circuit in the @entity120 it was form that she carried into the professional ranks in 2010 when she finished third in her first full season on the @entity125 ( @entity125 ) women 's world championship tour , earning her the @entity128 award			1
a year later she made history , winning the women 's world tour before a second title followed in 2013 as she won half of the season 's eight events			1
success is n't just down to what you do on the board , you also need to pick your waves with care			0
" it definitely takes years of being in the water			0
sometimes when you 're sitting out in the ocean , you may not see a wave coming in , you just feel it and you move in the right direction and seconds later , there 's the wave			0
" a good wave is one that has a nice wall ( that ) will allow for multiple turns and has a nice steepness to it			0
it 's tricky to describe			0
" @entity2 's surfing style has led to comparisons with her male counterparts and on occasions she has been granted entry to men 's events			1
in 2011 , she was the first woman to be offered a wild card entry to the men 's @entity165 in @entity77 .			1

@entity20 - born surfer @entity2 is a double world champion
twenty - two - year - old became sports youngest female world champion in 2011
women 's surfing beginning to *attract* similar profile to men 's world tour
@entity2 's fame has *arguably* *helped* boost women 's world tour prize money
