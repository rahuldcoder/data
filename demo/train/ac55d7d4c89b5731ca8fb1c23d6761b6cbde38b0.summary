-- let me tell you ' bout @entity3 and his deals of cocaine a little more every day holding for a friend till the band do well then the @entity9 locked him away -- @entity12 , " @entity11 " the first thing you notice about the @entity15 is the door			1
a thick steel door painted the color of the ocean on a cold day automatically slides open for visitors authorized to enter the jail			2
it makes a noise that fills the room when it closes			0
and then suddenly , it 's severely quiet			0
as if the door was designed to warn you it ca n't be easily opened			1
on the other side , past beige hallway after beige hallway and an outside walkway bathed in barbed wire , i arrived at @entity35 on the programs floor , where eight women were learning to play guitar and write songs			0
" let 's practice the g chord again and strum four times , " instructed @entity40 , an @entity41 - based singer - songwriter who teaches the weekly music class at the county jail in @entity44			1
the students each focus on wrapping their fingers around the frets of acoustic guitars , each one with " @entity11 " spray - painted on the wood			1
@entity11 is the name of an organization started by musician @entity56 in the @entity57			1
inspired by a song by @entity12 , @entity56 wanted to bring instruments and music education into prisons to support the rehabilitation process behind bars			1
it was only later that @entity56 learned the " @entity3 " in @entity12 song was his friend @entity65 , co-founder of the punk band @entity66			0
@entity65 was one of the most influential political musicians of a generation			0
but in 1975 , @entity65 was caught selling cocaine to undercover agents and served two years in the federal prison in @entity72 , @entity73			1
over three decades later , it was @entity56 who prompted @entity65 to start a @entity76 branch of the organization that @entity65 had inspired			1
this is how there came to be eight women in the @entity15 learning to play @entity82 chords and write songs			0
just a few miles away , the annual @entity85 music festival was getting underway , a massive event in which hundreds of thousands of music industry professionals and fans from around the world converge on @entity41 to hear their favorite bands or find new ones waiting to be discovered			1
from what i can tell , people mostly just spend a lot of time waiting in line and partying , throngs of music fans spilling over into the street in search of entertainment			1
but the class at the @entity15 jail reminds us that music is more than just entertainment			1
the power to transform someone 's life , the power to transform a system			2
almost all of the women at the @entity15 jail have been behind bars before			0
they 're facing trial for a range of offenses , from drug possession to parole violations to larceny			0
these are n't major crimes			2
one of the women in the class is on trial for shoplifting $ 15 in merchandise from a department store			0
but since it 's her fourth offense , she 's facing up to 20 years in prison if convicted			2
our criminal justice system is broken , as these women not only say but clearly show with such stories			2
yet the women also talk about how they are broken too , how they ca n't seem to turn their lives around			1
and they do n't want society to give up on them			2
they crave the services that have largely been slashed as the @entity76 has focused less on rehabilitation and more on simply warehousing people who commit crimes , contributing to our country having the highest incarceration rate in the world			1
" this class is n't just about music , " says @entity150 , a program coordinator on staff at the jail			1
the women are learning to channel their feelings into constructive outlets and to stop and think before acting			0
" it 's that impulsivity that can get you in trouble , " @entity150 says connecting the class to its real world implications			0
" you have to learn to use your breaks			0
" " what did you eat today for breakfast ? " asks @entity164			0
" oh , we had this awful meat patty thing that 's brown on the outside and pink on the inside , " one woman says			0
the seven other women erupt in agreement , the gray stripes of their uniforms bouncing with the energetic discussion			0
@entity164 interrupts , " ok , but what does that symbolize for you ? maybe you really do n't like it because it makes you miss your mom 's cooking			2
" the woman who brought up the meat patty in the first place jerks her shoulders back with the thought , then takes a deep breath and wipes her eyes			0
the meat patty is more than just a menu item			0
and these women 's lives can be more than just a prison term			1
" music is like an escape , " one of the women says during the discussion			2
" it reminds us there 's life outside , there 's something more than these walls to be a part of			0
" at the same time , @entity11 reminds us that music is about more than lines and concerts and hit singles			1
music is about expression and self - discovery and empowerment and transformation			2
and for eight women in the @entity15 , music is a way to respond to the noise of their lives and find a way to escape , at least metaphorically for now , that impenetrable door			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			1

as @entity85 begins , @entity228 visits prison
a program called @entity11 aims to use music to transforms lives and a system
@entity228 : @entity76 incarcerates too many and does n't spend enough on rehabilitation
