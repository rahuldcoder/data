@entity0 , @entity1 -- the slot machines are ringing , music is blasting at the crowded poolside bar , and people are dancing to celebrity djs at hip nightclubs			2
but this is not a scene on the @entity11			2
this action is taking place on an @entity15 reservation			1
@entity16 says the @entity17 is intended to help tribes with basic needs			1
business at the @entity21 in @entity0 , @entity1 , is booming and contributing to the @entity23 's great wealth			1
now the @entity24 are taking that wealth -- and the power that comes with it -- and using it to do something that has not been done before : organizing @entity29 tribes with the intent of spreading economic opportunities across @entity32			1
" some of these reservations i have been to -- it 's like the @entity37 right here in the @entity39 , " says @entity16 as president of the @entity34 , @entity16 has oversight over all the @entity42 cafés , hotels and casinos in the world except the café in @entity47 and the casino in @entity11			0
the @entity24 purchased the @entity42 properties in 2007 for a reported $ 965 million			1
@entity16 , a former alligator wrester and cattle rancher , is thankful for his tribe 's success and has used his influence to create a consortium of @entity55 called the @entity17			1
the goal of this group is to bring tribes throughout the @entity39 and @entity59 together in an effort to promote @entity29 - owned businesses and services			1
keeping the dollar within @entity32 , @entity16 hopes , will help the less fortunate tribes with basic needs such as housing , food and education			1
" i view this as historic in nature , " says @entity69 , the chief legal counsel from @entity71 's @entity70			0
" we have n't had first - nation to first - nation actually occur , and now with the success of the @entity24 and others , they have an opportunity to help tribes such as ourselves			1
" the help that the @entity70 seeks is financial			0
for the @entity70 , gaming is not an option , according to @entity69			0
" there 's less population , so the success in gaming can not be paralleled as elsewhere , " he says			0
" so we 've always viewed our future in energy			0
" that energy would come from coal			0
the @entity70 wants to mine some of the 9 billion tons of coal that it estimates is on its land			0
@entity70 chairman @entity98 hopes the success of his tribe will lie in turning coal into liquid diesel			0
" it will open the door for @entity32 in energy fields and help this country start veering away from its dependence on foreign oil , " he says			1
as the group meets to discuss coal , @entity16 recalls that it was the need for beef that prompted his idea for the @entity17			1
" here we have all these cafes , casinos -- everybody eats a hamburger , " says @entity16			0
" and than ( @entity122 ) realized that we do n't have enough beef to supply our own needs , and that 's when i reached out to other @entity15 that did have cattle			2
" @entity16 discovered there are more than 2 million heads of cattle on @entity15 land			2
if there is not enough cattle on @entity15 land , then members of the group are encouraged to keep the business in the country and buy @entity39			1
the @entity17 has come a long way since @entity16 was looking for cattle			2
the group now has more than 100 tribal members and more than 100 native - owned businesses			1
one successful business that joined the group is the largest @entity29 - owned contractor , @entity143			1
@entity144 , who is @entity145 , is its chairman of the board			0
" it was n't a far stretch for me at all to take a risk on this new organization because we are successful , we 're doing very well , " says @entity144 , who adds that a third of the company 's work is done for @entity29			0
one of the projects @entity143 is working on is a casino being built on @entity158 tribal land in @entity159 , @entity160			0
with every @entity29 - owned casino , @entity16 sees an economic opportunity for all			1
" trash bags , everybody uses trash bags -- so just for an example , let 's all get together and order trash bags and it 's going to be cheaper on all of us , " @entity16 says , pointing out that there is a @entity29 trash bag supplier			0
when discussing the potential of the @entity17 , @entity144 remembers something her father used to show her			2
" ( @entity177 ) showed me one stick and [ said ] you can break one stick easily , " @entity144 recalls			0
" when you bundle many sticks together , it is impossible to break			0
" this is her wish for the consortium -- " that we will bundle these many sticks together and become impossible to break			2

@entity24 owns @entity21 properties , looks to help unify @entity15
the @entity17 is a consortium of various tribes
keeping the dollar within @entity32 seen as way to help less fortunate tribes
group now *includes* more than 100 native - owned businesses
