the number of @entity5 who have crossed the border stood at 8,421 wednesday morning , according to @entity3 's disaster and emergency management directorate			1
their flight has been spurred by violence and a military offensive in the country , and @entity3 officials are worried that the border crisis could deteriorate and destabilize the region			0
world powers have been outraged at the violence , and at least 54 countries are backing a tough resolution on @entity5 that was to be issued wednesday at the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28			1
" it is impossible for us to remain indifferent to the developments there , " @entity3 foreign minister @entity29 said			0
" for us , the @entity5 are people who have common future and destiny with us			1
therefore , it is out of question to close the door to our @entity5 brothers or the ( refugee numbers ) to stop after 10,000			2
however , when this turns into a big wave , it also has the potential to become a regional and an international matter			0
" @entity5 security personnel have been carrying out a fierce crackdown against anti-government demonstrators over the past three months			1
in its draft joint statement about @entity5 , the @entity26 noted that more than 1,000 people " peacefully protesting for democracy " have been killed			1

@entity29 said that " escalating violence can increase the refugee wave " and that @entity3 is working on ways " to prevent escalation of violence			0
" his government touts a foreign policy dubbed " no problems , " a strategy intended to promote good relations with its neighbors			0
that policy has been challenged by the @entity5 situation			2
@entity3 fears a repeat of the enormous @entity112 refugee exodus from northern @entity113 in 1991 , and the country has spent the past decade promoting warm relations and lucrative economic ties with @entity5 's @entity81			2
but over the past month , @entity72 began calling for reform in @entity118 in a bid to curb the escalating violence			0
" we hope that @entity5 changes its attitude toward the civilians to a more tolerant one and realize its steps for reform in a more convincing way for the civilians , " @entity72 said last week , according to the semi-official @entity121 news agency			1
@entity29 said @entity3 's " wish and effort is for a process to begin at once that can prevent such a wave to continue increasingly			0
" he pointed to " reforms to be made as soon as possible , conditions to be eliminated that bring security forces and people against each other and to have a more peaceful approach , beyond focusing on security , in the attitude towards the civilian people			0
if all these were provided , the refugee wave would lessen			0
" of the refugees , 4,368 are children , and 73 @entity5 are now being treated in @entity3 hospitals , the emergency directorate said			1

many of the refugees have fled from a region that includes the northwestern town of @entity174 , seized by the @entity5 military over the weekend , a network of human rights activists said			1
the @entity5 government insists that it is stopping " armed terrorist groups " who carried out a " massacre " in the city : the killing 120 members of the security forces			1
the state - run @entity183 said wednesday that one of its correspondents is reporting a " new mass grave " in @entity174 " containing bodies belonging to police and security forces " slain by " armed terrorist groups			1
" opposition activists say the government 's claims are a ruse to justify a crackdown on demonstrators demanding government reform , in keeping with the wave of political protests across the @entity202 and @entity203 this year			0
but @entity5 refugees who have fled to @entity3 said some @entity5 soldiers rebelled after being ordered to fire on unarmed protesters and instead started fighting among themselves			1
