in presidential politics , very little is random			0
and the recent questions about @entity3 's age and health is anything but			1
@entity6 , as well as @entity8 outside groups and right - wing blogs , have stepped up efforts to redefine @entity3 , despite her nearly 40 years on the political stage			1
at the heart of this effort is one group of voters : young people			0
@entity18 think that young voters -- particularly @entity19 who were in diapers or listening to @entity21 during the eight years that @entity3 lived in the @entity22 -- could use a refresher course on all things @entity3			1
@entity18 feel young people could use their version of @entity3 's history - and might be impressionable over what might seem like distant history			1
they have stepped up their message and research efforts to rehash the news of the ' 90s -- including the policies and scandals that defined the years from 1992 to 2000 -- as part of their wider campaign against her as she mulls another run for president			1
@entity42 charge that the @entity18 campaign is just " dredging up " old news			1
@entity18 describe it as " citing " recent history			1
@entity48 attack was clumsy but shrewd " there is a whole swath of voters out there who obviously know of @entity3 and understand who the @entity55 are , but they do n't know of her as the politician , they do n't know the specifics about her time in the @entity22 , " @entity49 , spokeswoman for the @entity50 , said			1
details about the @entity61 years is not old news for people who were in " grade school " at the time , she said			1
the strategy has obvious pitfalls			0
@entity18 risk looking petty by bringing up old scandals			2
and it hinges on the assumption that young voters will be receptive to @entity18 views of @entity3 , who is liked by nearly two thirds of those between 18 - 29 sampled in a recent @entity77			1
" republicans have been good lately at proving they are all about the past while @entity3 is busy looking to the future , " said @entity78 , communications director for @entity79 , a @entity81 rapid response organization			2
" but , if @entity18 want to spend money educating young voters about how strong the economy was under president @entity3 's leadership in the 90s and how @entity19 broad - based prosperity was was at an all time high , who are we to stop them ? " @entity3 under fire for age , health @entity3 is also one of the most recognizable people in @entity19			1
she has more than 95 % name recognition with @entity19 voters and is considered the overwhelming favorite to win the @entity42 nomination , if she runs			2
republicans , however , feel they can still define her on their terms			0
" while a lot people assume everyone knows @entity3 , people under 30 do n't know specifics , " @entity49 said			1
" we need to be out there framing her early			0
" @entity18 pounce on @entity112 ' defeat " what is @entity3 's biggest accomplishment ? " as @entity3 weighs a @entity22 run in 2016 , @entity18 want young voters to think about this : what is @entity3 's biggest accomplishment ? " i think that is going to be a big issue in framing the debate and framing who @entity3 is to those voters , " @entity49 said			1
conservative blogs and publications have seemingly taken cues from the @entity50 on this question			0
just last week , @entity129 , a " center - right online news and commentary " website sent a reporter to @entity133 to question students about @entity3 's record			1
in a three - minute video that has bounced around right wing blogs , students seem unable to answer the question and those who respond offer meager answers ( one even cites @entity3 's handling of @entity141 as an accomplishment )			2
other blogs and right - leaning outlets have sent reporters to @entity147 meetings and college campuses to ask questions about @entity3 's record and history of political positions			2
@entity49 said she did n't know if that format comes directly from the @entity50 , but did say , " we do have somebody here that works with conservative bloggers all day every day			0
" the @entity18 strategy extends beyond the right wing blogosphere , too			2
top @entity18 strategists , like @entity48 , have shown how @entity18 might try to bring up @entity3 's age and health in a campaign			1
@entity48 dropped questions about @entity3 's health at an event that was picked up by a newspaper			2
he doubled down on the comments , drawing condemnation from @entity42			2
the strategy worked , however , as it dominated news about @entity3 for two days			1
@entity173 : all this attention could hurt @entity3 digging back into the ' 90s although @entity42 have called @entity48 " sleazy , " the stepped up attacks have already had an impact on the early 2016 presidential wrangling by solidifying what @entity18 have been saying for months : @entity3 is who they see as the most formidable potential candidate			1
representatives from a handful of @entity18 groups said they plan to operate as if she is running or until she says otherwise			2
but the comments have also forced @entity3 into the political fray			2
she had tried to stay above politics for months by giving high - profile paid speeches and traveling the country			0
but as @entity3 began to raise her profile , @entity18 began to step up their attacks and force a response			1
when she left the @entity194 , she joked with friends and confidants that she was looking forward to the " speeches and beaches " time of her life			0
that time appears to be over			0
in the past two weeks , she has dipped her toes into domestic politics , including her first congressional fundraiser of the midterms -- for a candidate who eventually lost , and has started to regularly tout her husband 's record in the @entity22			0
" the 1990s taught us that even in the face of difficult long term economic trends , it is possible through smart policies and sound investments to enjoy broad - based growth and shared prosperity , " @entity3 said during a speech at the @entity210			2
she added that her husband 's years in the @entity22 showed that " a rising tide really did raise all boats			0
" @entity223 , executive director of the @entity224 , said comments like that are an acknowledgment that she knows their time in the @entity22 from 1993 - 2001 will be an issue if she runs			0
" we are very conscious of the fact that there is a big slice of the electorate that does not have a full picture of @entity55 record , " @entity223 said			0
" i think that with the @entity55 would like to rely on is a nostalgic strategy with regards to their time in the @entity22 in the ' 90s and do n't want to get down into the details			0
" @entity223 , whose super pac has a cadre of researchers diving into the @entity3 record , said there will be an obvious focus on what younger voters need to know about her time in the @entity22			2
@entity223 added that while he does n't think the 2016 election will be won or lost on issues like @entity251 and other @entity61 scandals , he does think informing young voters , especially , about them is necessary			0
" i do think that for the generation that did n't live through that , that there is some value having the discussion , " he added			0
right now , @entity262 has roughly 60 full - time employees working for the organization , many of whom are primarily focused on cultivating research documents about @entity3 's world in the ' 80s and ' 90s			0
solidifying a definition defining a candidate early is nothing new in presidential politics , either			0
president @entity274 's campaign famously began to define @entity18 challenger @entity275 as out - of - touch early in the race			1
his team went up with ads early and spent tons of cash , hoping that @entity275 would be defined on their terms to many voters by final months of the campaign			0
" what happens is often times if you do n't introduce yourself , then you are leaving that task to the opposition , " said @entity284 , a @entity18 strategist and @entity275 spokesman			1
" what happens is when the oppositions provides a greater reservoir of information about you and it is negative then it is tough to turn around those perceptions			0
" @entity274 prevailed in a campaign that many saw as perilous for him			0
but defining @entity3 before she has said whether she will run or not is somewhat unprecedented			1
@entity18 say that is only because of the unprecedented shadow campaign around @entity3 right now			1
" the strategy is to force her out of the shadow campaign she is winning by acclimation , " said @entity303 , a @entity18 strategist and the author of " you 've come a @entity306 , maybe			1
" " that is the undercurrent here in bringing out issues about health or legacy			0
( @entity18 are n't ) going to allow @entity3 to be anointed without taking the heat			1
" opinion : why i 'm ready for @entity3			0

@entity18 step up efforts to define @entity3 , who has n't said whether she *'ll* run for president
a certain *demographic* does n't likely know much about the @entity325 years
@entity42 charge the @entity18 campaign is ' dredging up " old news
