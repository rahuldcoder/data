@entity0 -- there 's nothing funny about the issue of migrant farm labor -- unless @entity7 's @entity6 is discussing it			1
@entity6 , accompanied by a media swarm , sarcastically testified on @entity9 friday about the conditions facing @entity12 's undocumented farm workers			1
the popular host of " @entity14 " told members of a @entity17 subcommittee that he hoped to bring attention to the workers ' hardships			1
" i certainly hope that my star power can bump this hearing all the way up to @entity24 1 , " he joked			0
" @entity12 's farms are presently far too dependent on immigrant labor to pick our fruits and vegetables , " he told the subcommittee , keeping in character with the arch - conservative he plays on television			1
" now , the obvious answer is for all of us to stop eating fruits and vegetables			0
and if you look at the recent obesity statistics , many @entity12 have already started			0
" @entity6 told the panel that " we all know there is a long tradition of great nations importing foreign workers to do their farm work			1
" " after all , " he said , " it was the ancient israelites who built the first food pyramids			0
i do n't want a tomato picked by a @entity52			0
i want it picked by an @entity12 , then sliced by a @entity54 , and served by a @entity55 in a spa where a @entity57 gives me a @entity58			0
" " my great - grandfather did not travel across four thousand miles of the @entity61 to see this nation overrun by immigrants , " he declared			0
" he did it because he killed a man back in @entity66			0
" @entity6 appeared before @entity68 the day after " @entity14 " showed video of him packing corn and picking beans on a farm as part of a challenge from a pro-immigrant - labor group			1
" i 'll admit i started my work day with preconceived notions of migrant labor , " @entity6 said			1
" but after working with these men and women ... @entity81 in the unforgiving sun i have to say -- and i do mean this sincerely -- please do n't make me do this again			0
it is really , really hard			0
" the brief experience , he said , " gave me some small understanding why so few @entity12 are clamoring to begin an exciting career as seasonal migrant field workers			1
" @entity6 appeared alongside , among others , @entity93 president @entity92 , whose group over the summer launched " @entity95 , " a campaign that challenged @entity12 citizens to replace immigrants in farm work			1
the group , which says only seven citizens or legal residents have taken it up on the offer , argues that immigrant workers are n't taking citizens ' jobs , and is pushing for a bill that would give undocumented farm workers currently in the @entity12 the right to earn legal status			1
on his show thursday night , @entity6 mocked those deriding his appearance before the committee , saying he agreed that showing up in character would " sully the good name of experts that @entity118 - controlled congresses have actually called to testify in the past , " like @entity119 , the @entity121 character who promoted music education before a @entity17 subcommittee in 2002			1
republicans on the subcommittee were not impressed or swayed by @entity6 's appearance			1
" maybe we should be spending less time watching @entity7 and more time considering all the real jobs that are out there -- ones that require real hard labor and ones that do n't involve sitting behind a desk , " said rep. @entity128 , @entity129			2
" if we did we 'd realize that every day ... @entity12 perform the dirtiest , most difficult , most dangerous ( jobs ) that can be thrown at them			2
" many of these workers , @entity128 said , " would prefer the aroma of fresh dirt to that of the sewage of @entity12 elitists who disparage them even as they flush			2
" " it 's an insult to me to hear that @entity12 wo n't do this work , " he added , arguing that the hiring of undocumented workers is driving down wages and taking jobs away from those in the country legally			1
rep. @entity153 , @entity154 , used the occasion to rip the @entity158 administration 's immigration policy			0
the notion that there 's little competition for jobs between citizens and undocumented workers is a " myth , " he claimed			1
" we could make millions of jobs available to @entity12 citizens ... if the federal government simply enforced our immigration laws , " @entity153 asserted			1
" unfortunately this administration is turning its back on @entity12 workers			2
" democrats were quick to challenge the @entity118 ' claims			2
while @entity12 will take tough jobs , " study after study " shows that " people would rather have no income and no welfare than take the back - breaking jobs that the migrant farm worker has to do every single day , " said rep. @entity184 , @entity185			1
" were it not for immigrant farm workers in this country , there would be no seasonal fresh fruit and vegetables , " he said			2
most of the media attention , however , remained focused on @entity6			0
the chairwoman of the subcommittee , rep. @entity194 , @entity185 , told @entity1 's @entity197 before the hearing that she did n't think @entity6 's appearance was a stunt			2
" celebrities add pizzazz to an issue , " she said			0
" i hope his celebrity will bring attention " to this one			0
but another @entity206 , @entity208 rep. @entity207 , initially seemed unimpressed with @entity6 , asking him to leave the committee room and merely submit his written statement instead			0
@entity6 noted that he was testifying at @entity212 's invitation , and said that he would remove himself at her request			2
@entity207 later told @entity1 he feared @entity6 would create a " circus " atmosphere			0
but @entity6 , who engaged in a question - and - answer session with the subcommittee , actually turned out to be " profound , " he said			2
@entity1 's @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221 contributed to this report			0
