-- the @entity1 in @entity2 is going high - tech in a bid to reverse a dramatic decline in the number of priests			1
an establishment viewed as a bastion of tradition is turning to a new app to encourage more " applications			0
" the app , says the church , is " designed to promote vocations to the priesthood			1
" it is being hailed as a " world first " by the church in @entity2			1
" the app is an original approach to assist current and future generations seeking to investigate and find information on vocations to the diocesan priesthood in @entity2 , " a statement issued ahead of the launch said			1
the number of new recruits to the priesthood has fallen sharply in the recent decades -- and as @entity2 has become engulfed in a series of child sex abuse scandals over the past few years			1
the situation led to a respected former catholic bishop in @entity2 to call for an end to clerical celibacy			2
@entity36 , the retired bishop of @entity37 , said allowing clergymen to marry would ease many of the church 's problems			0
@entity36 told @entity0 he was worried about the decreasing number of priests and the number of older priests			2
the issue " needs to be addressed and addressed urgently , " @entity36 said , adding he found it " heartbreaking " priests were forced to resign or prospective priests were unable to join the priesthood because of the celibacy rule			2
the new ' vocations ' app was designed by father @entity53 and developed by the company @entity54 , based in @entity55			1
it is available to download for free from the @entity57 , said the church			0
some of the features of the app , according to the church , are : connection to @entity63 and @entity64 ; social networking at the service of vocations ; contact details and statistics on the 26 dioceses of @entity2 ; frequently asked questions to assist a person to discern his vocation ; news feed running from the national vocations website ; novel and cursory ' tests ' to enable the user to reflect on vocation potential			1
" future updates will include a " prayer counter " to allow people pledge a period of prayer for vocations and a picture gallery which will include some images from the life of a seminarian , " the church statement said			0
the launch of the new app marks the official handover from @entity53 as the @entity94 to father @entity95 and his team , said the church			0
the app is part of a campaign promoted on the church website -- http://www.vocations.ie -- and follows ' priesthood sunday , ' which was on september 25			2
the website called it " an opportunity to highlight and promote particularly the vocation to the priesthood			2
" a statement on the website stressed more priests are needed : " the number of priests per @entity1 has declined over the past 40 years			1
this makes it more difficult for individual parishioners to establish a close relationship with any one particular priest			0
" " also , priests are no longer the only ones who offer pastoral care to our people , " the statement continued			0
" yet without a priest , no parish is able to be a @entity128 community			0
it is important to reaffirm the importance of the priesthood of @entity132 and its central place in the life of our church			0

the app is a first by the @entity1 in @entity2
it 's being *billed* as a ' world first "
the app is " designed to promote vocations to the priesthood "
the number of priests per @entity1 has declined over the past 40 years
