-- once investigators looking for @entity3 decide to shift from listening for pings emanating from the floor of the @entity6 to poring over its terrain , they will begin drawing from a whole new set of tools			1
among them will be the @entity12 - 21 , a probe equipped with side - scan sonar -- an acoustic technology that creates pictures from the reflections of sound rather than light			1
" that is a piece of equipment that does assist in locating where the wreckage may be , " said @entity20 , an oceanographer from @entity21 who was chief scientist for the @entity22			0
a ' massive , massive task ' though the discovery of four pings believed to be from the jet 's so - called black boxes -- its flight data recorder and its cockpit voice recorder -- have helped investigators narrow the search area , they would still face a formidable task			1
" it 's a lot of terrain to cover , " given that the @entity12 - 21 moves at the pace of a leisurely stroll , she told @entity0			1
though it moves slowly , it creates good images -- so good that they are " almost a picture of what 's there ... but it 's imaged with sound instead of with a camera			0
" listen for a ping , and the water may play tricks on you once the debris field is found , then other equipment -- such as remotely operated vehicles -- would be brought in to recover the black boxes , @entity55 said			1
rovs working at depths of three miles would require power conveyed down a cable from a ship above , she said			0
" there are not many pieces of equipment in the world able to do this			0
" and there are only a handful of countries that have manned submarines capable of descending to such depths , she said , citing the @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			0
" having the human presence there can make a big difference , " she said			0
it " can give you a real edge in terms of understanding what 's there			0
" the scarcity of resources " shows how ill - prepared we are to operate in the deep sea , " @entity55 said			2
" we 've invested in aviation and aerospace , and we 've been neglecting the ocean			2
" the time to move from listening for pings to looking for debris is fast approaching , said @entity100 , a former @entity101 accident investigator			1
" we 're right on the cusp where we need to go from passive listening to active ( looking ) with the @entity12 , " he told @entity0			1
that 's because the batteries powering the black boxes ' locator devices are probably already dead , said @entity107 , former inspector general for the @entity75 @entity108 , who noted that more than four days had elapsed since any pings were detected			0
" i 'm surprised that they lasted as long as they did , " she said			0
the failure of searchers to find any debris linked to the plane has not surprised @entity0 aviation analyst @entity116 , author of " @entity117			1
" the model used for tracking the debris could be incorrect , he said , noting that that was the case when investigators were searching for evidence of @entity122 , which plunged into the southern @entity123 in 2009 , killing all 228 people aboard			2
" they spent weeks looking for debris in the wrong area , " he said			2
the lack of debris could also mean that the plane did not break apart on impact , but instead sank largely intact , he said			1
if that was the case , it could complicate the effort to retrieve the black boxes , since they were stored inside the tail of the plane			1
investigators would have to dismantle the tail in order to extract them and whatever secrets they may hold			2
lessons from past air disasters where 's the debris ? how deep is deep ?			0

probe of the ocean floor will move from ping locators to sonar
the @entity152 is equipped with side - scan sonar
and once the debris field is found , investigators would turn to remotely operated vehicles
an intact plane could complicate the search effort , @entity0 analyst says
