-- we had a process			0
@entity3 proposed , and the president disposed with his signature			0
a law then went on the books			0
courts might be asked to test its constitutionality , but by surviving legal challenges , a measure became the settled law of the land , which was the case with @entity14			0
the @entity16 legislative system was , in spite of the disturbing influence of big money , actually quite elegant			1
but now it is broken			2
we have entered into an era of gunpoint government			1
@entity16 have discovered that a tiny , radical minority can immobilize their entire country and hold it as still as a robbery victim staring at the barrel of a pointed gun			1
and regardless of how this might anger the majority , they must live with the fact that it can happen again			2
political accommodation for the common good is not even a consideration			0
shutting the country down is the only objective , with no purpose beyond political destruction and personal ambition			0
any argument that the temporary closing of the @entity16 federal government did not accomplish anything , in this scheme , therefore , is wrong			1
sen. @entity46 of @entity47 and his acolytes of extremism have cracked the @entity50 into two dissimilar parts			1
the corpus of the moderate version survives with frailties and reduced numbers that make its national leadership improbable in the foreseeable future , while the @entity60 offspring of the @entity50 remain vital , as they have felt the blood rush of being a bully			1
but neither part of the @entity50 won a thing			1
except for the disdain of most @entity16 , and , possibly , much of the world			1
global leaders undoubtedly wonder why the @entity16 thinks exporting its version of democracy is sane			1
political recalcitrance over the @entity16 debt ceiling threatened to toss international markets into chaos simply because a small cabal of conservatives did not like a new law to provide health care to millions of people who can not otherwise afford premiums			1
politics or petulance ? the anger of the few in the minority was never supposed to be able to stop the will of the majority			1
the founders would be confounded			0
exasperation , however , has to be tempered by the painful knowledge that we the people elected these people			0
@entity46 of @entity47 , who has become the de facto leader of the national @entity50 and appears to be shepherding his party into a burning building , won office by defeating his state 's lieutenant governor in a july runoff			1
the @entity47 tea party is made joyful by @entity46 's exhortations , and in the obscure runoff 15 months ago , during the 100 - plus - degree - burn of summer , they voted for him in big numbers , while moderates were hesitant to venture outdoors to even buy cold beer -- or vote			1
the defeated @entity109 , his rival , who is still in office , clearly envies the network tv lights cast upon the neophyte @entity47 senator and has begun a rank imitation with calls for the president 's impeachment			0
a reason hardly seems to matter			0
the inflammatory quote is what counts			0
but if we live in a democracy , do n't we deserve what we have ? politics now is the art of screaming louder than the other person and claiming principles that are so profound they are more important than the preservation of the union			0
the streak of anarchy that runs through the politics of @entity46 and the tea party ought to frighten sober @entity16			1
his ideological strain thrives on the notion that government should do little more than protect the borders , pave the roads and then get the hell out of our way			0
@entity46 is wrong , of course , and the obligations of liberty are considerably more complex			1
we might die to preserve our nation 's principles but most of us wo n't kill our country to win an argument			0
if @entity46 knew from the outset he was in an unwinnable fight , what was he really doing ? what did he want ? the obvious conclusion was that he lusted for attention to build a reputation among the tea party activists , whom he wants to begin thinking of him as their presidential candidate for 2016			1
they voted in disproportionate numbers to get him into the @entity165 and he hopes to animate that political base across the country and ride their cheers to the @entity50 nomination			2
whether that happens is of considerably less importance to note than the fact that he was willing to jeopardize the lives and incomes of millions of @entity16 , along with global economies , simply to get cameras pointed in his direction			2
is there any other conclusion ? @entity46 thinks he can speak directly to the voters and rise without the help of the political infrastructure of his party			1
such an unconventional strategy may be his only hope , because there are few left in the @entity50 who will offer him any respect			2
the public has watched in abject horror as one office holder has pressed history 's greatest democracy into a sausage grinder			2
and what has come out the other end is not immediately recognizable			0
our deliberative government was not designed to be hijacked by a few dissidents			2
but fanatics have found a way to pry open the cockpit door and demand course corrections that put everyone on board at risk			0
because of this , we may have no choice but to rethink the very mechanics of how we create law and run the nation			0
@entity46 has at least done us the benefit of showing us that our system functions best as a platform for campaigning and getting re-elected and not for conducting the people 's business ; not even the disgraced @entity218 created such jeopardy with his betrayal			1
but it 's our fault			0
we cast the ballots and gave office to @entity46 and his compatriots			2
the politically craven have taken up arms to stop the peoples ' business and the attention is intoxicating			0
they have no reason to put down their weapons			0
they like this game because now it only takes one person to storm the battlements that protect @entity16 democracy			1
@entity240 got his gun the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			2

@entity244 : once elegant @entity16 democracy now in era of gunpoint government
he says @entity46 and tea party , with minority ruling majority , flout democratic ideal
he says willingness to halt government until one man 's goals met is @entity46 's point
@entity244 : @entity46 and company have broken @entity50 in two , shown how our system can be hijacked
