less than 24 hours after being named the winner of the third season of " @entity3 , " @entity0 is still catching her breath			1
" i do n't think it 's really settled in yet , " she tells @entity6			2
" it 's just unreal			2
i ca n't believe it			2
i have n't had a chance to sit down and soak it up			2
but it 's just crazy			2
" in addition to winning the show , @entity0 , 23 , is still coming to grips with the fact that she sang " i 'm with you , " one of her " all - time favorite songs , " with its original vocalist , @entity18			1
@entity0 has long admired the @entity21 singer			1
" she 's always had that thing about her that always spoke to me , which is being who she is and not apologizing for it , " explains @entity0			1
" that 's something that i have trouble with , honestly			2
i do care about what people think about me sometimes , and sometimes it affects me in a negative way			2
her music has always been there to remind me to not care what other people think and be myself			0
" @entity0 wins season three of " @entity3 " @entity0 -- a native of @entity37 , @entity38 , and the former lead singer of the @entity40 vets hey monday -- admits she was hesitant at first to audition for " @entity3			1
" last year , while still a member of her band , @entity0 turned down an offer to audition for season two			1
but after moving to @entity46 to try her hand at a solo career , struggling to pay the bills and exhausting all her contacts in the music business , @entity0 says she was forced to reconsider her options when @entity3 came calling again			1
" i almost passed on it again , " she admits			0
" i do n't know why			0
just being in the band world , you tend to get a little proud			0
a part of me just did n't want to do this show because i wanted to do it from the ground up			1
i really wanted to do it the old - fashioned way , which is kind of impossible nowadays -- especially when everyone thinks you 're going to sound exactly like your band and no one 's interested			0
" ' @entity3 : ' @entity68 complete coverage not surprisingly , @entity0 has no regrets now			1
" doing the show was , i think , the best career decision i 've ever made , " she says			1
" it got people to really take a second to listen			0
it 's not going to be hey monday ; it 's going to be something entirely different			0
" that 's not to say @entity0 did n't have second thoughts throughout the season			1
the singer admits she was taken aback when many on the @entity84 protested that her previous music - industry experience put her at an unfair advantage in the competition			0
" when i came into [ the show ] , i got a lot of that and it was discouraging , " she says			1
" but i had to just prove myself and try to prove people wrong			0
i thought it was kind of crazy to think that someone like me -- who 's been working towards this my whole life , since i was four years old , and then toured in bands and did all that , and really has been working hard -- does n't deserve it as much as someone else next to me who 's never done it before			0
i feel like if you have the heart and the passion for it , you deserve it			0
" ' @entity3 : ' season three awards @entity0 evolved significantly as a singer on @entity3 , shedding her pop - punk roots and embracing country music , the genre of choice for mentor @entity111			1
in fact , the singer 's standout moment of the season was her performance of the @entity111 ballad " over you , " which became the sole song on the show this season to top the @entity122 charts			1
while initially dismissive of the genre , @entity0 says now that she sees many similarities between it and her more familiar pop - rock			1
" @entity129 tell stories , " she says			0
" that 's something that i can relate to			0
" having secured a record contract with @entity133 in her victory , @entity0 will soon hit the studio to record her debut solo album			1
" [ it will be ] a little bit more of a @entity142 , early 2000s feel , " she says			0
" pop - rock but with a little bit of a country twist on it			0
there 's a lot of things to work out and i know that it 's going to take some meetings to figure it out			0
but i would love to do pop - rock / country [ album ] so i 'm able to cover all the bases			2
