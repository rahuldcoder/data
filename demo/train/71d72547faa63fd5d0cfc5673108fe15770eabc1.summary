-- after a year of 10 - to - 14 hour workdays , the use of seven recording studios and just under $ 1 million in production costs , @entity7 's " rumours " was released in 1977 -- and it has n't fallen out of rotation since			1
the classic disc was the no. 1 album on the charts for 31 weeks , with @entity11 naming " rumours " the 25th greatest album of all time			1
it is the 10th best - selling album ever with more than 40 million copies sold to date , and it features four top 10 singles			1
it won the @entity18 and , 35 years later , remains the band 's most successful effort			2
@entity21 , author of the new book , " making rumours : the @entity27 of the @entity28 , " was the iconic album 's engineer / co-producer			1
( he 's also the father of @entity31 - winning singer @entity30 and produced her no. 1 album , " breakthrough			1
" ) " rumours , " @entity30 said , is the " perfect album because it had this really great combination of lyrics and ... well - thought - out musical components , " he told @entity0			1
" it 's the perfect ride for the perfect time			1
" but @entity7 's story began in another decade on another continent			1
and as fate would have it , the only two members who were with the group from the start are its namesakes : @entity50 and @entity51			2
@entity7 was originally a blues - format group formed in @entity53 in 1967 by @entity7 , @entity51 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
in 1970 , @entity54 left the group and @entity51 's wife , keyboardist / vocalist @entity57 , joined			2
@entity55 left that same year , and the late guitarist @entity59 joined			0
the group relocated to @entity61 in 1974			0
@entity59 , who took his own life earlier this month , resigned in december 1974 and was replaced by guitarist / vocalist @entity63 and vocalist @entity64			0
by the time @entity63 and @entity64 joined , @entity7 had put out 10 albums but had yet to have a big hit in the @entity67 in the book , @entity30 described " rumours , " @entity7 's second album with @entity64 and @entity71 , as " a journey that a handful of people ... took during the mid- 1970s			1
" it was " made out of flaws in the human spirit , sometimes through agonizing determination , love , lust , and a force of will that made failure unthinkable			0
" recording began on " rumours " on january 28 , 1976 , at the @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity61			1
twelve days earlier , @entity30 had never even heard of the band , but that would soon change because 1975 's eponymous " @entity7 " album ( " @entity91 , " " @entity92 " ) was beginning to climb the charts			1
" what 's ironic is that throughout the ' rumours ' journey , @entity7 went from one end of the fame spectrum to the other , " @entity30 noted			1
" that day in @entity87 , when we walked into the studio to start recording , they were an established band , but you could hardly say they were rock stars			2
before we even released ' rumours , ' that had changed dramatically			2
" although @entity64 arguably became the best - known member of @entity7 , when they first started recording " rumours , " many involved with the project thought she was the band 's weakest link , @entity30 said			1
" she was somewhat of a sweet hippie chick , and she did n't have a lot of technical knowledge about music and instrumentation , " he said			0
" ultimately , her ethereal songwriting and vocals added a dimension ... that was every bit as essential as any other band member 's contributions			2
" ( incidentally , @entity64 wrote the band 's only no. 1 hit , " dreams			1
" ) @entity30 described @entity63 , who often clashed with band mates , as " extraordinarily talented " as well as " unpredictable , " " brilliant but difficult			0
" however , @entity30 said , " with @entity63 's contribution ... everyone in the world who 'd ever heard a song on the radio would eventually know who @entity7 was by the time ' rumours ' had run its course			1
" in the book , @entity30 described the unique way in which @entity63 taught himself guitar			0
he uses his fingernails instead of a pick , which is quite common , except instead of plucking strings upward individually , he can play more than one string at a time by stroking down --- and up -- with the backs of his nails , which allows him to play several notes at once			0
@entity63 honed this skill years before joining @entity7 when he was bedridden with mononucleosis for six months			2
at the time they were recording the album , all five band mates were going through painful breakups : the @entity152 were divorcing , @entity71 and @entity64 ' long - term relationship was coming to a bitter end and @entity50 's wife was about to leave him for his best friend			1
it 's all personal drama that @entity30 chronicles in his book			0
" in retrospect , it 's a miracle that we were able to finish ' rumours , ' " he said			2
" but later , i came to understand that ' rumours ' probably succeeded because it was brilliant group therapy			0
... it 's horrible that if it had n't been for all of the relationship turmoil in the band , you would n't know this record any better than some of the previous @entity7 records			1
" @entity175 was contagious in the studio , which @entity30 said was besieged with arguments , drugs and alcohol			0
during the summer of ' 76 , the band took a break from recording " rumours " to go on tour to promote their " @entity7 " album			1
it was the first time @entity63 and @entity64 had played in front of a very large crowd , and the concert tour propelled the band to superstardom			0
even though " @entity7 " was released in july of 1975 , it finally hit no. 1 in september of 1976			1
as soon as the album began to lose momentum , the record label wanted the band to have the first single off " rumours " -- " @entity195 " -- ready to go			1
@entity30 recalled that it was @entity51 who came up with the album 's title			0
" @entity51 told us about a brainstorm he had recently had , " he said			0
" with all the rumors flying around about this album , why do n't we call the album ' rumours ' ? but let 's spell it the @entity53 way			2
" another major step involved in creating what would become an iconic album was selecting song sequence , which was " crucial because it can make or break the album 's success			0
" the idea was to make it compelling and tell a story through music			0
" back then , " @entity30 said , " running orders were important ; and because it was vinyl , you 'd put the needle down and listen to side one all the way through to side two , and it was just like going to @entity226 -- you 'd get lifted up on a high song and it 'd slow down a bit ; again , perfect ! and i can only take a little bit of credit for that , but i was really proud to be a part of that			0
" @entity30 told @entity0 that he believes " rumours " still resonates to this day " because it 's great music			2
it happened to be created out of a lot of pain and suffering and sincerity and it just so happens that every song is great , every lyric is great , and every song has something that seems to appeal to someone -- except me			0
" that 's right -- @entity30 can no longer bear to listen to " rumours			2
" " i see all the little pieces and i can visualize the arguments and i see the assembly of it all , " he said			0
" i can see behind the curtain , so to speak			0
" however , part of the reason @entity30 knew that the story of " rumours " needed to be told was because " we experienced something extraordinary , something bigger than all of us			0
" in search of the perfect album : readers weigh in			0
