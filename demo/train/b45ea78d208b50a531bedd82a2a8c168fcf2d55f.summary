-- the evening before they set off on their voyage across the @entity5 on saturday march 20 , skipper @entity1 and @entity2 spoke to @entity0 about their last minute preparations			1
@entity0 : how are feeling just hours before sailing ? @entity1 : i 'm feeling great			1
i do n't feel nervous at all			2
i 've just left the boat and it 's lying a little low in the water as it 's loaded up with all the supplies ; sustainably - sourced food that we 've actually canned ourselves , plus there 's loads of camera equipment			1
all in all , i 'm feeling really positive about the voyage and confident in the boat			1
if anything happens you could not blame the preparation ; the energy and passion from everyone has been amazing			2
@entity2 : i think my feelings are best summed up for me by @entity27 when he wrote : " twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you did n't do than by the ones you did do			0
so throw off the bow lines			0
sail away from the safe harbor			0
catch the trade winds in your sails			0
" @entity0 : what 's been the hardest part of your last minute preparations ? @entity1 : one of the hardest parts is leaving a lot of the team behind			1
we 've spent so much time together sometimes spending 24 - hour shifts building the boat , so we 've become a really tight knit family			1
it 's also sad to leave @entity47			1
it 's been such an amazing city to be in to build the boat and launch the project -- it 's attracted so many intelligent , positive and creative people to our project @entity0 : @entity1 , you 're an experience sailor , how does this expedition feel compared to others ? @entity1 : it does feel a bit different to other journeys in a way			1
i 'm very aware that we have a novice crew , but i 'm very positive that everyone has their own role to play			2
so we 'll be off tomorrow morning , slipping our mooring at 9am			0
the winds will be westerly , which is n't ideal as we really want to be able to sail out under the @entity69			0
my mum came to see me off and was looking at what i 'd packed and and said it was all thermals and warm clothes			0
we should make our first port in around 30 days			0
but she said to me , " what if you end up in @entity79 ? " obviously that 's not the plan , but if so you could be seeing me in a bikini and longjohns ! right i 'm off to pack up my flat now and see if i can get in one last glass of red wine .			2
