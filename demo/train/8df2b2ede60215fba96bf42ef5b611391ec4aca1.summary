@entity0 -- a political summit between president @entity3 and congressional leaders tuesday yielded further talks on how to extend @entity7 - era tax breaks scheduled to expire at the end of the year , as well as an acknowledgement from @entity3 that he needs to reach out more to @entity10			1
the meeting , dubbed by some the " @entity13 " for a campaign dig by @entity3 at congressional @entity10 , involved the president and leaders of both parties from the @entity17 and @entity18			1
it came in the aftermath of the november midterm election in which @entity10 took control of the @entity17 and gained six seats in the @entity24 - controlled @entity18			1
originally proposed by @entity3 as a half - day event that could extend into dinner , the meeting was postponed once by @entity10 leaders and ended up lasting about two hours			1
afterward , @entity3 and @entity10 leaders said they wanted to work together , but they also made clear that sharp differences exist on major issues			1
" there are real philosophical differences , deeply held principles to which each party holds , " @entity3 said			2
" and although the atmosphere in today 's meeting was extremely civil , there 's no doubt that those differences are going to remain no matter how many meetings we have			0
" rep. @entity44 of @entity45 , the expected incoming @entity17 speaker , said the fact that the meeting was civil did not guarantee success or progress			0
" we 've had a lot of nice meetings , " @entity44 said			0
" the question is whether we can find common ground			0
" both @entity3 and congressional @entity10 emphasized the talks on the tax cut issue as a major issue in the meeting			1
" that process is beginning right away , and we expect to get some answers back in the next couple of days , " @entity3 said			0
however , he cautioned that both parties still have deep disagreements , even as they attempt to find " sensible common ground " on the tax provisions			0
@entity44 said talks involving the treasury secretary , @entity17 budget officials and members of @entity70 from both parties will examine the tax issue			1
the congressional negotiators will be sen. @entity74 of @entity75 and rep. @entity76 of @entity77 for the @entity78 , with sen. @entity79 of @entity80 and rep. @entity81 of @entity82 for the @entity83			0
however , @entity18 @entity10 leader @entity84 of @entity85 indicated that there is little leeway in the @entity10 stance , saying that all @entity18 republicans and some @entity78 want all the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 to be extended			1
@entity3 and the @entity83 described the talks as civil and frank			0
rep. @entity92 of @entity93 said he was encouraged that @entity3 acknowledged that he should have reached out more to @entity10 in his first two years in office and that tuesday 's meeting would be the first in a series of discussions on working together			1
@entity44 also said @entity3 conceded not spending enough time working with @entity10			1
during the election campaign , @entity3 and @entity78 repeatedly characterized republicans as obstructionists with a policy of opposition to everything proposed by @entity78 in order to score political points			0
@entity17 press secretary @entity108 confirmed that @entity3 told the @entity10 leaders that he needed to do a better job in seeking consensus			1
" i think the president laid out that in order for us to work together , we 're going to have to communicate , " @entity108 said			0
" the president was pretty clearly in acknowledging that he needed to do better , and he would			0
" asked whether @entity3 was bending to @entity10 by saying he needed to reach out more to them , @entity108 said : " i 'm not sure i call that bending ; i call that trying to work together			1
" in remarks after the event , @entity3 said he invited @entity10 and @entity24 leaders to meet with him again several times in the future , including one summit at @entity125			1
on the tax cut issue , @entity3 has called for @entity70 to extend the lower tax rates for most @entity128 before they expire december 31			2
the president 's proposal would extend the lower rates for people earning up to $ 200,000 a year or families earning up to $ 250,000 while allowing the rates for those earning more to return to the higher levels of the 1990s			2
@entity10 want the lower tax rates extended for all @entity128 regardless of income level			1
a possible compromise floated by @entity78 would raise the income threshold for the lower rates to those earning up to $ 1 million			0
@entity143 said @entity10 oppose differing policies for different taxpayers , based on income			2
" it is the view of 100 percent of @entity18 republicans and a number of @entity78 as well that ... we ought to treat all tax rates the same , " @entity143 said			1
another issue expected to come up at the meeting was a new nuclear arms treaty with @entity156			0
the @entity158 treaty , which requires @entity18 approval , would resume mutual inspections of @entity128 and @entity156 nuclear arsenals while limiting both nations to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers each			2
@entity3 has called approval of the treaty an immediate priority , saying it 's critical to national security and a cornerstone of @entity128 - @entity156 relations			0
however , 10 @entity10 senators -- led by @entity79 -- have urged a delay until the next @entity70 over concerns about the current @entity18 workload and the need to modernize the @entity128 nuclear arsenal			1
in particular , @entity79 and @entity143 complain that @entity18 @entity78 want to push through @entity24 proposals in the current lame - duck session before their larger majority goes down in the new @entity70 in january			2
@entity143 said tuesday that issues such as repealing the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy banning openly gay and lesbian soldiers and the @entity183 -- which would create a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who came to the country as children and get a college degree or complete two years of military service -- were less important than the tax rate issue and a needed agreement on government funding for the rest of the fiscal year , which expires at the end of september			0
@entity108 , however , said @entity3 and @entity78 believe that all of the pending issues are important to @entity128 and that there is plenty of time for the @entity18 to take them up in the lame - duck session that runs through december			2
@entity44 and @entity143 , in a piece that appeared on the @entity206 website tuesday , said @entity10 and @entity78 can work together			2
" the clock may be winding down on this session of @entity70 , but there is still time to do the right thing , " the opinion article stated			0
" if president @entity3 and @entity24 leaders put forward a plan during the lame - duck session to cut spending and stop the tax hikes on all @entity128 , they can count on a positive response from @entity10			1
if the president and @entity24 leaders do n't act before the end of the year , however , @entity17 and @entity18 @entity10 will work to get the job done in the new @entity70			1
but we hope it does n't come to that			0
" during midterm election campaigning , @entity3 often used a car analogy to describe his efforts , backed by congressional democrats , to help the @entity128 economy recover from a recession they inherited			0
his stump speech described @entity78 working to " dig the car out of the ditch " while @entity10 sat back " sipping on a slurpee , " a frozen drink			2
when @entity3 originally proposed the meeting with congressional leaders , @entity17 reporters immediately called it a " @entity13			1
" " let 's hope the president will be willing to work with us to cut spending , stop the tax hikes and get our economy working again , " @entity44 spokesman @entity241 said this month			2
" then we can all go get @entity249 together			0
" @entity1 's @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 contributed to this report .			0
