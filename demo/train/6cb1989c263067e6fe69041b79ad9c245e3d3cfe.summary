-- check your ground beef before you grill this @entity3 weekend			1
the @entity5 's @entity4 says stores in at least 15 states may have received beef contaminated with @entity9 : @entity10			1
the service announced this week that 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products were being recalled because they could be contaminated			1
the federal agency has since named businesses that may have received the tainted products			1
stores that may be affected include : @entity18 stores in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 @entity30 's @entity29 in @entity31 , @entity19 @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity19 @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity20 @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity23 @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 @entity48 's @entity47 in @entity49 , @entity50 @entity52 's @entity51 in @entity53 , @entity50 @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity25 @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity25 @entity59 's market in @entity60 , @entity27 @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity27 @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity27 @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity27 @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity27 @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71 @entity73 's market in @entity74 , @entity71 @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity71 what government tests found in your meat a representative for the @entity81 @entity5 said the meat is being removed from store shelves			2
but consumers should return or throw out meat that has the code @entity86 and a production date between march 31 and april 18 , 2014			0
the ground beef is sold under a variety of labels , according to the @entity5 , but comes from @entity92 in @entity93			2
" while none of the @entity92 product has tested positive for the pathogen implicated in this outbreak , the company felt it was prudent to take this voluntary recall action in response to the illnesses and initial outbreak investigation findings , " said @entity94 , a spokesman for @entity92			0
eleven people across four states are suspected to have been sickened by the product , according to the @entity5 , which learned about the first such illnesses on may 8			1
ten of those people were sickened after eating at restaurants that received contaminated meat			1
but federal officials say regulations prohibit them from naming those restaurants			0
" people who were exposed were already exposed , so it does n't help the public to tell them now that a certain restaurant was associated with these illnesses , " said @entity113 , assistant administrator for the @entity114 at the @entity5			2
" our job really is to identify product that may still be available			0
" according to information officials received from the packing company , he said , the meat went to many states			1
yesterday , it was on the order of nearly 40 states , but we do n't -- that number changes			2
that 's part of the process , too , is to identify where the food -- the meat in this case -- was actually distributed , " @entity113 said			0
the recall was categorized by the @entity4 as @entity138 : a health hazard situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious , adverse health consequences or death			0
@entity9 is a large group of bacteria that live in the intestines of people and animals , according to the @entity151			1
certain strains cause gastrointestinal illness in humans , with symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea			0
an estimated 265,000 infections occur in the @entity81 each year , the @entity151 says			0
people usually get sick three to four days after ingesting the bacteria and recover on their own			1
young children , pregnant women , the elderly and people who have weakened immune systems ( like cancer or @entity168 patients ) are at greater risk for severe illness and death			1
the best way to avoid getting sick is by washing hands frequently when preparing food and avoiding cross-contamination by washing cutting boards , counters and utensils with hot , soapy water			2
properly washing hands after using the bathroom and after coming into contact with animals or being in their environments -- anywhere there may be traces of feces -- also helps			0
cooking meats thoroughly to at least 160 ° @entity190 kills the bacteria and prevents infection as well			0
using a meat thermometer will most accurately help you determine that the food is thoroughly cooked			0
@entity196 : do n't get sick from your picnic @entity4 officials said in a news release that the agency is continuing to work with state and federal public health partners on the investigation and provide updated information as it becomes available			0
