-- an experimental @entity2 drug that 's still in development may now be used to treat more people with the disease , according to @entity6			1
the drug company said the @entity8 has authorized expanded use of @entity2 under its @entity11 application rule			1
expanded access allows patients outside of a clinical trial to be treated with an investigational drug if they have a life - threatening disease and have exhausted any other approved treatment options			1
the @entity8 allows this kind of access on a case - by - case basis			2
" we have worked with the @entity8 and @entity24 to establish this framework and a treatment protocol allowing us to do what we can to help these patients , " dr. @entity21 , @entity6 's president and ceo , said in a statement			1
in january , a small human trial of @entity2 was put on hold after one volunteer developed moderate gastrointestinal side effects after receiving a high dose of the medication			0
then last month , the @entity8 modified the hold to a " partial clinical hold			0
" this meant that @entity6 could give the drug to doctors or hospitals that requested it on an emergency basis			2
according to @entity21 , the treatment has already been given to a number of patients and " repeat infusions " of the drug have been well tolerated			2
though more @entity2 patients may now be given the drug , he warns that they will not be enrolled in a controlled clinical trial			1
@entity8 spokesperson @entity51 said federal law and @entity8 regulations prevent the agency from disclosing information about products under development because it 's considered confidential			0
" while the @entity8 can not comment on the development of specific medical products , " @entity58 said , " it 's important to note that every @entity8 regulatory decision is based on a risk - benefit assessment of scientific data that includes the context of use for the product and the patient population being studied			0
" according to the company , the @entity8 granted @entity6 fast track status to develop @entity2 back in march			1
@entity21 said their supply is limited , " but we will continue to help where we can			0
