-- it says a lot about how jovial a person was , and how fondly that person is liable to be remembered , when your first thought upon hearing of that person 's death is a clear memory of a loud , long , infectious laugh			1
@entity12 , who died monday at age 77 , was exactly that sort of guy			1
if you ever listened to @entity12 and younger brother @entity18 , 65 , bantering on @entity20 's long - running " @entity21 " radio show , you know the laugh			1
and if you do n't , why in the world not ? these two siblings -- equal parts auto mechanics , students of the human condition and sit - down comics -- first appeared on public radio locally , with a program from @entity34 's @entity33 in 1977			2
they and their show went national on @entity20 in 1987 , the same year @entity36 's " @entity35 " with @entity37 , the program to which i contribute as tv critic and occasional substitute host , also went national on @entity20			2
yet i never met @entity12 or @entity18 , and never even phoned their call - in show to be advised , harangued and entertained			1
it was enough just to listen each week -- so much so that , though i did n't know @entity12 personally , i feel like i did , and i feel a genuine loss at the news of his death from complications from @entity52 's			1
and i 'm guessing , if you 're taking the time to read this , you feel exactly the same			0
the two men stopped generating new " @entity21 " episodes in 2012			1
by then though , they 'd generated such a backlog that the best archived shows could be repeated without any drop in momentum -- just without the ability for listeners to call in			2
and not even that seemed to matter , because the callers on those old shows , and the way @entity12 and @entity65 , the @entity21 -- interacted with them was more than entertaining enough to make up for it			1
apparently , that will continue to be true			0
@entity18 has been quoted as saying he would like the shows to continue as a tribute to his brother			0
selfishly , i 'd like them to continue , too , because the running of my weekend errands always went a little smoother when " @entity21 " was on my car radio			1
smoother , but not faster , because i 'd often stay in the car listening , long after arriving at my destination , just to hear how @entity12 and @entity18 dealt with their callers , and especially with each other			1
their automotive advice usually was sound , even if it sounded off the cuff and occasionally even flippant			2
but the two of them -- especially @entity12 , who was quick with a joke and quicker with a probing but good - natured personal question -- were equally adept at sharing advice outside the car frames			1
any time a caller began a plea for help with " my husband says ... , " or " my girlfriend hates it when i ... , " you knew you were in for an overtime session , sitting there listening to the two brothers dispense advice and laughter in fairly equal measure			2
it 's clear , from a listener 's perspective , that they loved people , loved each other and loved being on the radio			0
listen to them for hours , or for years -- or for decades , as i have -- and i challenge you to find one moment where either of them sounds remotely stiff or nervous			0
even when reading those tongue - twisting , tongue - in - cheek closing credits or working their way through the ultra-complicated puzzles of the week ( i 've yet to solve even one ) , they 're loose , laughing , and having fun			0
that 's not common on public radio			0
and it 's a real gift			0
listening to them was like eavesdropping on a raucous family conversation , because that 's exactly what was happening			0
the laughs the " @entity21 " siblings brought to public radio could be assessed historically , if you wanted to go that way and place @entity65 in a media context			1
like @entity135 's " @entity134 " on @entity136 , " @entity21 " took itself frivolously -- and pioneered such later public radio comedy confections as @entity20 's " wait , wait ... @entity138 ! , " distributed out of @entity139			1
it 's neither coincidence nor a surprise that both shows are produced by the same man , @entity143 , who clearly sees the value of a good laugh			0
on radio , of course , you do n't need to " see " a good laugh			0
and @entity12 's laugh was one of the warmest , loudest , most delightful laughs of all			2
i sure will miss it .			0

@entity21 dispensed sound advice on cars and life with infectious laughter , he says
