@entity0 -- the @entity2 will hear arguments this week in two same - sex marriage cases			1
whatever the justices do , the outcome seems foreordained			0
when 80 % of @entity7 under 30 agree about something , that something will happen -- it 's only a matter of time			2
but while straight young @entity7 support marriage for gays , increasingly they opt against marriage for themselves			1
nearly half of @entity7 children , 48 % , are now born to unmarried women			1
among women without college degrees , and of all races , unwed motherhood has become the norm			0
this is the crisis of the @entity7 family			2
whether same - sex marriage proceeds fast or slow , whether it extends to all 50 states or stops with the current nine plus the @entity0 , the crisis will be the same			1
marriage and the @entity2 : five things to watch children born to single parents face much longer odds in life than children born to married parents			1
( a new study by @entity39 suggests that the harms are especially intense for boys , less so for girls			0
) " odds " are not rules , of course			0
on average , however , children born to married mothers and fathers are more likely to finish college , more likely to avoid prison and more likely to form marriages themselves than children born to single parents			1
and precisely because the harms of single parenthood tend to be self - replicating , the breakdown of marriage threatens to harden into a caste divide , with some families launched into cycles of downward mobility because of the unstable relationships of parents or grandparents or great - grandparents			1
for 20 years , @entity7 have fiercely debated whether gays -- who constitute maybe 3 % of the population -- should be allowed to marry each other			2
meanwhile , @entity7 have given short shrift to what is happening to the 97 % of the population that is allowed to marry , but increasingly opts not to do so			1
chief justice @entity75 ' lesbian cousin to attend same - sex marriage hearings one reason we 've given the single - parenthood problem short shrift is that we lack good ideas about how to address it			1
the core of the problem seems to be the decline of male wages relative to female wages			0
the @entity87 this week quoted an @entity89 economist , @entity88 : " i think the greatest , most astonishing fact that i am aware of in social science right now is that women have been able to hear the labor market screaming out ' you need more education ' and have been able to respond to that , and men have not			0
and it 's very , very scary for economists because people should be responding to price signals			0
it 's a fact in need of an explanation			0
" as men ( on average ) finish less education , as male wages ( on average ) decline , men become less attractive as marital partners			0
as @entity115 's @entity114 -- a left - leaning academic , it should be stressed -- said in that same @entity87 piece : " single - parent families tend to emerge in places where the men already are a mess			2
" @entity121 : the county where no one 's gay but how do we make men without a college education less of a mess ? this is the master problem of @entity7 society , and not only @entity7 society			2
everywhere in the developed world , the decline of mass - production industries has put pressure on the roles and incomes of working - class and middle - class men			0
the expansion of government and service industries has opened new opportunities for women , of which working - class and middle - class men seem less able to avail themselves			0
it 's important to note that men in full - time work continue to earn more than women in full - time work			0
but that bottom - line number conceals a widening divergence between the family patterns of the college - educated top one - third , where family life is increasingly stable , and those of the non-college - educated bottom two - thirds , where family life is increasingly disrupted			1
it 's the family life of the bottom two - thirds that is the family policy challenge of the 21st century			2
the debate over same - sex marriage is yesteryear 's issue			1
it 's settled , whether the @entity2 knows it or not			0
but how to ensure that the next generation of @entity7 children enjoys the more equal chance and the wider opportunities from a more universal commitment to marriage -- that debate needs to begin			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			2

@entity178 : young people *overwhelmingly* support same - sex marriage
he says a bigger *question* is the future of marriage in general
younger @entity7 are increasingly choosing not to get married
@entity190 : children born to single parents face much longer odds in life
