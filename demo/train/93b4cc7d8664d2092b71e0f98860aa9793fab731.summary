-- @entity1 knows his history -- it 's a good job too given it 's very much weighing on his shoulders			1
@entity6 's iconic @entity5 may have been given a $ 500 million upgrade , but beneath the new shiny exterior , the scars of pain and anguish are still raw for many @entity12			1
but next year @entity6 has a chance to exorcize those demons as the @entity16 country hosts the @entity17 for the first time since 1950			1
then football 's greatest show ended in tears and failure after a 2 - 1 defeat against @entity24 in the final match of the tournament crushed any illusion of supremacy and left a proud country nursing a pain which still runs deep to this very day			2
" every day there 's something going on in my head , " @entity12 captain @entity1 , whose hands could grasp the famous old trophy 64 years on should @entity6 be victorious , told @entity0			1
" even the @entity12 press wo n't allow us to forget the @entity17 in 1950 in a full @entity5			1
" so that idea gets stuck in your head , but that 's good			2
it 's something we can resolve			2
" we expect a lot from ourselves			0
we talk a lot and our commitment is very big , so i believe we are going to have a lot of success			0
" it 's not going to be easy but we are on the right track			2
" at the age of 28 , @entity1 has established himself as one of the most accomplished defenders in the world following an outstanding season with @entity57			2
all this in the space of five years since arriving in @entity59 with @entity60 from @entity61 in 2008			0
after winning the 2011 league title with @entity60 and being honored as the top defender in @entity64 , he made a $ 55 million move to @entity57 the following year along with striker @entity66			0
now , following a series of glowing performances on the domestic front and in the @entity70 , the defender is aiming to peak in time for next year 's global blockbuster			1
" i see myself as an important player on the pitch and in the tactical scheme of the national team , " said @entity1			2
" i see myself as a reference for the rest of the group			0
we do n't know what 's going to happen in the future , but so far ( at the moment ) i 'm the captain of the @entity6 team			1
" it 's a unique experience in my life , to represent thousands of @entity12 across the world			0
it 's not for everyone			0
" fortunately things have been going well			0
we are not 100 % aware of our capabilities , but we are very close to what we can achieve			0
" one man who could prove intrinsic to @entity6 's success is the precociously talented @entity95 -- largely considered to be one of world football 's hottest properties			1
the @entity100 striker , who is reportedly being courted by both @entity102 giants @entity103 and @entity104 , is expected to spearhead @entity6 's attack			1
but @entity95 does not come without his critics -- one of whom is @entity12 legend @entity109 , who has accused the youngster of being more interested in his hairdo than his football			1
a lack of playing experience in @entity59 competition has also cast question marks over @entity95 's ability to compete on the very highest stage			1
his anonymous showing in the final of the @entity121 against @entity122 in 2012 led to a barrage of criticism and accusations that he is simply not living up to his hype			0
but @entity1 says @entity95 will only prove successful when his critics allow him to get on with what he does best -- playing football			1
" our biggest star nowadays is @entity95 and i think people have to have a little bit more respect with the professional that is @entity136 , " said @entity1			1
" he 's a great guy with a very pure and good heart and people sometimes make things up and start talking rubbish where there 's nothing to talk about			0
" i would like to ask for people to have a bit more patience with him because he 's our biggest star at the moment			0
" if he 's not relaxed and ready to play and does n't have support , the team can suffer a lot from it			0
" the man charged with harnessing @entity95 's talent is coach @entity155 -- the mastermind behind @entity6 's last march to @entity17 glory in 2002			1
@entity155 , who was reappointed last november , will first target june 's @entity158 with success there likely to further boost expectations in @entity6			1
the 64 - year - old , affectionately known as " @entity163 " , first took on the job in 2001 before guiding @entity6 to success in @entity166 and @entity167 the following year			1
" he 's a serious guy , " @entity1 said of the national coach , who has also enjoyed time in charge of @entity171 and @entity172 amongst many others			1
" on the other hand , he 's happy as well , very joyful , " added the @entity6 captain			1
" he has his moments to have fun , but he 's a guy that when it 's time to work , it 's time to work and to be serious about what you are doing			2
" what i like about him is his personality			0
he 's a firm guy in his words , if you are not playing well , you will get benched			0
" if you are benched and are training well you will have your opportunity			0
" he 's a very open person			0
if you are playing well you will play , if not , you wo n't play , that 's the way football should be			0
" i see in him a very positive guy			0
he 's a person who has won it all and wants to win even more			2
" i hope we can have success together since we are getting a strong group for the @entity17 and to win titles , which is the most important in football			1
" @entity155 's selection policy will no doubt be heavily scrutinized with question marks still hanging over the likes of @entity201 and @entity202			1
@entity17 winner @entity201 , 33 , played against @entity203 in january 2013 having not featured on the international stage for nearly a year			1
@entity202 , 31 , was once considered the finest player in the world but has seen his career stagnate since moving from @entity60 to @entity104 in 2009			2
both men still harbor ambitions of pulling on the famous yellow shirt in front of their home fans -- a dream which is still intact according to @entity1			2
" there 's always room in our team for players who are in good form , " he added			0
" i 'm sure if they are playing well , they will have other opportunities			0
" @entity6 's team is like that , it 's filled with opportunities and players of great quality			2
" when you 're talking about @entity202 and @entity201 -- i do n't even have words to describe those two great players that the @entity12 football has			1
" you can be sure that if they are playing well in their clubs , i 'm sure @entity155 will give them another opportunity			0

@entity6 will host the @entity17 next year for the first time since 1950
