-- two teams of scientists say they have found a key area of the @entity5 bird flu virus which seems to be vital to its ability to copy itself , and hope the discovery could lead to new drugs to fight the infection			1
human - to - human transmission of avian flu is rare , but in some cases , the virus has passed from poultry to humans			1
the discovery is generating excitement among scientists who are looking for a new weapon against the bird flu virus that typically kills more than half its human victims			1
two separate groups of scientists -- one in @entity24 , one in @entity25 -- used a highly technical process to identify protein that seems to be involved in its ability to replicate itself			2
that gives researchers a new target , as they try and develop new medications			0
the announcements , detailed in the @entity35 - based journal nature , come at an uneasy time for those who follow the bird flu strain called @entity5			1
so far this disease is mainly affecting birds in some countries and the number of human cases remains small , but the virus has shown no sign of growing milder since it first infected people back in 1997			1
it continues to decimate bird flocks in sporadic outbreaks , mostly in @entity51 , and occasionally breaks into the human population			2
@entity24 's @entity53 reported eight human cases last month , including four deaths			1
since 2003 , the @entity56 has confirmed 404 human cases worldwide			1
nearly two - thirds of the victims have died			0
while @entity5 does n't make headlines the way it did in 2005 , health officials say the continuing severity of the infections means the alarm is still on			1
@entity67 viruses , in general , spread easily			0
if @entity5 were to acquire the genetic ability to pass easily from person to person , it could turn into a major catastrophe			2
many countries have stockpiled both vaccines and antiviral medications , for such a scenario			0
the same medications that are used to treat regular flu , oseltamivir ( @entity80 ) and zanamivir ( @entity82 ) , also seem to be effective against @entity5			1
but that 's no reason to rest easy			0
all flu viruses tend to mutate rapidly , which is why the flu vaccine one year , wo n't protect you against the next year 's flu			0
those rapid mutations mean the virus tends to develop a resistance to any widely used medication			2
dr. @entity92 , director of the @entity93 , told @entity0 , " it always happens that eventually , sooner or later , the [ flu ] virus will develop varying degrees of resistance			2
you just hope that it 's kept to a minimum			0
" the findings in @entity102 may lead to another option to fight bird flu , but an actual new drug is years away			1
a vaccine could be effective , but they first have to know what strain of flu they 're fighting			0
the current strategy of health officials around the world is to try to contain isolated cases before they spread			0
the best case scenario would be , that this h5n1 killer remains primarily a disease for the birds .			0

*experts* say they have found key *component* of the @entity5 bird flu virus
it is hoped this will lead to better medication to fight the infection
@entity24 reported its first human - to - human infection in 2005
since 2003 , the @entity56 has confirmed 404 human cases
