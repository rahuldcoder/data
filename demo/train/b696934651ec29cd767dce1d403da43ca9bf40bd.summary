-- @entity1 is something of a living legend among lovers of crime fiction			1
a favorite of millions of readers , a hero to scores of writers , he 's been called " @entity12 's greatest crime writer			1
" the 86 - year old author has been writing bestselling books for sixty years , mostly westerns and crime novels			1
many of them have been turned into hit movies , including " 3:10 to @entity20 , " " @entity21 " and " @entity22			1
" now , @entity1 returns to one of his favorite characters in his newest book , his 45th novel to be exact , titled simply , " @entity27			1
" that would be @entity12 marshal @entity29			1
the laid back , @entity31 - wearing lawman first appeared in @entity1 's novels , " @entity40 " and " @entity39 " and again in the 2001 short story , " @entity38 " which became the basis for the hit tv show , " justified , " starring @entity36 as the title character			1
the actor and the show are winning over fans , critics and @entity1 himself			1
so much so that @entity1 has returned to writing about " @entity27			1
" the book just hit store shelves the same week the show had its third season premiere			1
@entity1 , gracious and unassuming , shows no signs of slowing down at this point in his career			1
the author spoke to @entity0 from his home in @entity55			1
the following is an edited transcript			1
@entity0 : what brought you back to @entity27 ? leonard : i 've always liked him			1
he 's just one of my favorites			2
now when i see him on the screen i ca n't believe it			2
he acts exactly the way i write him			2
he 's so laid back and he always has the best line in the scene			2
he 's perfect , boy			2
the way he talks i hear him just the way i heard him when i 'm writing it			1
he 's kind of laid back but if you call him on anything , he says , " if i have to pull my gun i will shoot to kill , " and he 's serious about that but he does n't have to sound that serious , he just states it			2
@entity0 : @entity27 feels like a character from one of your westerns transplanted into one of your crime novels			1
leonard : he could have been and maybe that 's where i got him			2
the critics see him as a western character because of his hat but his hat was n't my idea , that was his ( @entity36 's ) idea			1
i pictured a businessman 's @entity31 , a much smaller cowboy hat if you will but one that 's kind of worn out and shaped exactly the way he likes it			2
i think the hat works			2
i did n't care for it at first but after a couple of episodes i liked the hat			2
@entity0 : the writers on " @entity102 " all wear wristbands with the initials wwed stamped on them for " what would @entity106 ? " what do you think about that ? leonard : well , i 'm flattered			1
i met all the writers and every one of them had the little plastic bracelet on			2
i have a picture of all them and they 're at their desk and they all have a different book of mine and each one is reading to get my sound			2
that 's very flattering , i 'll tell you			2
@entity0 : do you have an active role with the tv show beyond your inspiration ? leonard : no and i do n't want to know what they 're doing because i do n't want to interfere with them			1
while i was writing " @entity27 " i would send them pages and i said use what you want , if you do n't use any of it ok but if it fits use it			1
they found some places to use some scenes where they 're taking body parts from victims and selling them			2
they 're going to do it one of the episodes this year so that 's very gratifying			1
i like the way they write , boy			0
sometimes i think the show is better than my writing			1
@entity0 : millions love to read your books but who are you a fan of and what do you like to read ? leonard : one of my favorites is @entity162 who wrote , " @entity163			0
" today i like reading @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169			0
he only wrote three or four books but he was a pilot on the @entity171 , piloting a string of barges up and down the river			0
the way he described his characters and the way they talked , i just loved him and he was funny			0
that 's what i missed in @entity180 because he never showed any sense of humor			0
i do n't know why he was so serious			0
i still read his short stories because they 're so good			0
he does n't waste any words			0
@entity0 : you 've been writing professionally for sixty years , where do you find your inspiration ? leonard : it 's what i do			1
if i just sit here what am i going to do ? i do n't have a trade			0
i do n't teach or anything			0
i just love to make up characters and gradually build a story around them			0
there was a photograph in the newspaper of two marshals in front of a courthouse in @entity209 where some drug dealers were being tried and the woman marshal had a shotgun on her hip , the stock against her hip and the rest of it angled up away from her and she was really good looking			0
i thought she 's a book , she 's going to be in my next book and she was			0
that was @entity221 , " @entity22			0
" @entity0 : sounds like you still have lot of enthusiasm for your work ? leonard : absolutely , that 's it			0
to me writing is the most fun			1
it 's not always fun but finally when you make it come out the way you want it then you can say its fun , boy			0
even writing a scene i 'll enjoy a particular scene and then several years later i 'll happen to read that scene again , not looking for it , i 'll just happen to open an older book and read and think oh my god and start laughing			1
i did n't laugh when i wrote it maybe i smiled , i do n't know			0
i was startled by the scene ; i thought why 'd i think of that ? why did i put that in there but it seemed to work			0
@entity0 : your stories read so easily , how did you develop your style ? leonard : it 's got to be re-writing			0
it takes me at least three handwritten pages to get one clean , typed page with every word in place			0
the next morning i 'll read these pages again and i 'll start to make little changes , not much usually i 'll just add things			0
the first time i write it 's more spare then when i finally get into it , just add a word maybe add a cigarette or a drink or something like that			0
i do n't want it to sound like writing			1
i say leave out the parts people tend to skip			0
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? leonard : i 'm writing a book right now but i 'm only a chapter into it			1
i 'm still thinking of names			0
for a couple of months i 've been thinking of the bad guy 's name			0
i do n't know why i ca n't get it but i will			0
i do this a lot with names			0
i 'll start with a name and then for some reason he wo n't talk much or he 's older than i pictured him just because of a name i give him			0
so then i finally get the right name and i ca n't shut the guy up			0
there 's always a character who gives me trouble that way			1
