-- hail stones the size of fists pummel the small sailboat lurching violently in the @entity5			0
blanketed in darkness , @entity6 desperately tries to steer his 18 - strong crew through 50 - knot hurricane winds and waves three - storeys high			1
as dawn approaches , a monster wave flips the yacht , ripping out the steering and smashing @entity16 against the deck			0
falling in and out of consciousness , the 29 - year - old is rescued by @entity21 coast guards who take him to the closest hospital -- 900 kilometers away in @entity23			1
it 's a terrifying and ultimately death - defying moment for the it engineer from @entity26			1
yet now , as he looks back three months after completing the year - long @entity28 , @entity6 says the journey was also the greatest experience of his life			1
he was one of 500 amateur sailors racing ten yachts 64,500 kilometers across the globe , battling everything from hurricanes in the @entity37 to the dreaded doldrums of @entity39			1
it may seem like the sort of grand adventure only the most hardened sailor would be capable of			0
but in an unusual twist , the majority of people on board have never sailed a boat in their lives			1
the event organizers are now recruiting for next year 's clipper race			1
those who enter face the prospect of saying goodbye to their jobs , family and friends for a 12 - month voyage on the high seas			1
setting sail in july 2013 from @entity61 in the @entity62 , the 70 - ft yachts will visit 15 ports on all six continents			1
the journey is made up of eight legs , with sailors able to join for one of these , or the full circumnavigation			2
founded in 1996 by sir @entity70 -- the first person to sail solo , non-stop , around the world in 1969 -- the @entity71 revolves around the notion anyone can circumnavigate the globe , regardless of their experience			1
the only selection criteria is people must be over 18 , pass a three - week sailing course and be physically fit enough to complete the epic voyage			1
at Â £ 43,000 ( $ 69,000 ) per person for a full year - long voyage , it 's not simply a huge physical undertaking , but a significant financial one			1
" a lot of people thought i was crazy			0
they said : ' you could be using that money to put a deposit on a house or a luxury holiday around the world , ' " said @entity89			2
" but they 're such boring , standard options			0
i saw this as a personal investment			0
" @entity101 @entity100 , who also completed the full circumnavigation on a different yacht , raised part of the money for her trip through a sponsored 1,300 kilometer cycle ride from @entity108 to the @entity109			2
after being selected from almost 800 applicants , the 27 - year - old novice sailor quit her retail assistant job , packed up her house and moved to @entity62 for an intensive sailing course			1
within months she was bunking down with 17 other strangers in a clipper headed for their first stop -- @entity119 in @entity120			0
" you 're living with guys and girls in an open room with two rows of bunks on either side , " @entity121 said			0
" shifts are four hours long , so when you 're up on deck you 're steering the boat , dealing with rigging , making repairs			2
by the time you get into bed you might only have two hours sleep , " she added			0
with limited access to phones and internet , the crew is essentially cut off from the outside world			2
" we only heard about the volcanic ash which shut down airports in @entity146 because we were sailing past it , " added @entity121			0
" instead , you learn a lot about the people on board -- it 's human interaction on a really deep level , " she said			1
throughout last year 's race , participants ranged from 18 to 73 - years - old , hailing from 40 countries across the world			1
they included a @entity160 scientist , ballet teacher , tv weather girl , farmer , undertaker and @entity26 cabbie driver			0
for @entity16 , the biggest challenge came just two months before the end of the race when his vessel was almost destroyed in a storm 900 kilometer off the coast of @entity23			2
@entity16 was flung against metal railing in the accident , suffering a strained hip , while fellow crew member @entity176 , 50 , also from @entity62 , broke her ribs			0
" the deck looked like a warzone			0
there was no steering left and everyone 's life jackets had popped open , " @entity89 said			1
" i had a sharp pain in my hip -- i thought ' this is what it must feel like to be hit by a car			0
' they initially tried to airlift me and @entity176 out with a helicopter but it was too dangerous with the mast swinging about			0
" the boat , still miraculously in one piece , was repaired in @entity23 , and the crew went on to finish sixth in a field of 10			0
but along with the challenges came moments of joy			2
" you might be sitting up on deck and hear this whistling sound and it 's a pod of dolphins or whales or giant sea turtles , " @entity89 said			2
for self - confessed " ballsy " sailor @entity121 , her favorite memory was of gliding down waves the size of four - storey buildings in the @entity212			2
" it 's agony because it 's so cold ; around 3 degrees @entity214 )			2
but here you are surfing down the face of these mountains of water , " she reminisced			0
the clipper race was a life - changing adventure for both @entity121 and @entity16			1
after all , why stress about a late train or rainy weather when you 've survived the most brutal waves on the planet ? " not many people can say they 've sailed around the world , " @entity89 said			0
" it 's made me realize you should n't be afraid of things and it 's definitely given me more confidence			0
" @entity121 , whose boat won the race , now teaches sailing professionally and hopes to again sail around the world -- this time on her own			1
" i 've started living my life by the quote : ' just do , because the world is changed by doers , ' " she said			1
" you 're not going to change the world by sitting on the couch watching tv			0
