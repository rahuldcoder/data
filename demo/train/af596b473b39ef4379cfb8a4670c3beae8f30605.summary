-- when it comes to the environment , aviation has a rather dirty reputation			0
the industry produced 689 million tons of co2 in 2012 , according to @entity7 ( 12 % of global transportation 's carbon dioxide emissions ) -- a number that is sure to grow as global demand for flight continues to skyrocket			2
" aviation will double in size worldwide in the next two decades , and if we 're not able to provide a sustainable means to fly , we will create a ceiling for growth in the industry , " says @entity13 , director of innovation at @entity15			1
as a result , it looks like the aviation industry is ready to green up its game			0
in january , @entity27 announced a new initiative to build a biofuel supply chain in the @entity30 , as well as research it 's conducting into biofuels made from salt water - consuming desert plants			1
@entity36 has similarly partnered with local producers and airlines to sniff out sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels			2
to name just a few partnerships , the airplane manufacturer teamed with @entity43 to to produce sustainable aviation fuels from eucalyptus mallee trees in @entity46			2
@entity36 has also joined other aerospace companies in launching the @entity49 initiative , a collaborative project funded by the @entity51 to produce and test the use of sustainable jet fuel			1
@entity54 , @entity36 ' head of new energies , notes that no single crop will do the job for biofuels , and that to achieve true sustainability , biofuel -- like food -- is best when it 's locally - sourced			1
" different countries grow different crops			0
they have different refineries in place			0
sustainability is n't just about reducing emissions in the air			0
we have to consider the whole life - cycle in terms of production , " he notes			2
going the distance long - haul flights make up 80 % of aviation 's co2 emissions			2
as a result , cutting down the carbon footprint for these flights is extra important			0
in may , @entity15 took the first step and launched a new series of flights traveling between @entity87 and @entity88 that use a 20 % biofuel blend			1
the flight is part of @entity15 's short - term goal to integrate 1 % of biofuel into all its flights by 2015			1
the main barrier to using biofuel on a larger scale , says @entity13 , is the price			0
" today , bio jet fuel is still three to four times more expensive than fossil fuel , because there 's no continuous production			1
there 's a demonstrated hole in the value chain , " he notes			0
to solve the problem , in 2010 @entity15 became a joint founder of @entity110 -- a major supplier of eco-efficient jet fuel			1
" we believed the development of bio jet fuel was important , and that we could n't keep it within the boundaries of @entity15 , so we decided to come up with a new company			1
in the last five years , @entity110 have supplied approximately 25 airlines , " he says			1
@entity110 is also working with airlines and airports around the world to create bioports -- or supply chains of sustainable jet fuel -- in a bid to ultimately bring down the price			1
" with an increase volume , we could see price parity within the next ten years , " says @entity13			0
other steps depending on the source of jet fuel and how it 's cultivated , @entity13 estimates using biofuel could reduce carbon emissions between 50 and 80 % , depending mainly on the feedstock and conversion process			1
he notes that there are other methods currently in use to drop that percentage even further			0
" the way of taking off , the way of landing , and the route you choose to fly can all impact emissions , " he notes			0
planes that make a continuous ascent or descent when landing or taking off -- instead of the more traditional " step - down " approach -- he says burn less fuel			2
@entity54 also notes that @entity36 is slashing emissions by switching to more innovative materials			0
" we use a lot of composite materials now , which are lighter , and by bringing the weight down , you bring fuel consumption down , " he says .			0

@entity15 recently flew from @entity87 to @entity88 using sustainable jet fuel
the 10 - hour flight was the longest to ever use biofuel
@entity15 is founding partner of @entity110 , a supplier of sustainable jet fuel
