-- it 's not the internet to @entity3			1
it 's " the @entity2 " -- with quotation marks			2
@entity3 is trying to make a point			1
thanks to the @entity10 's rapid spread and overwhelming influence on 21st - century society , we 've come to think of cyberlife as something distinct from our everyday interactions			2
to proponents , it has brought a cornucopia of information that will allow society to fix its most intractable problems			2
but in his new book , " to save everything , click here , " @entity3 pushes back against that belief			1
he is skeptical of such " solutionism , " pointing out that just because smart technology has its benefits does n't mean it 's going to lead to utopia			1
( after all , one man 's utopia is another 's " @entity30			2
" ) it 's not like @entity3 is a @entity32			1
he has a website and maintains an active @entity35 feed with more than 40,000 followers , and he digs deep into information sites and services			0
it 's just that he wants the public to stop and think about the consequences of our headlong rush in embracing the latest digital tools			1
@entity0 spoke via e-mail with the noted tech thinker about why he wrote the book , the flaws in being overawed by the latest gadgetry and the costs of data accumulation			1
the following is an edited version of our interview			0
@entity0 : why write the book ? do you feel like you 're swimming upstream against popular opinion , and do you care ? @entity3 : while writing my first book , " @entity62 , " i became fascinated by two questions			1
first , why do we find our current technological situation -- of which the @entity2 is certainly the most attractive and popular example -- unique , and what role this uniqueness plays in policy			2
second , now that technology companies play such an important role in public life -- mostly because they run the digital infrastructure through which much of this life happens -- what are the costs and benefits of enlisting them in important social and political projects ? in the new book , i continue with the same two questions but shift my attention from authoritarian states and foreign policy to more mundane , domestic issues			1
what makes us think that problems like obesity or climate change might be technologically solvable ? and what makes us think that technology companies , with their penchant for apps , would make good allies in this fight ? as for the " swimming upstream " part , it does n't bother me at all			2
@entity0 : you talk a lot about " the @entity2 , " putting the term in quotes so it 's not considered its own marvelous entity			2
but is n't " the @entity2 , " even if it 's not all its promoters say it is or want it to be , a huge leap forward in communications ? @entity3 : this might be trivially true , but the problem with terms like " the @entity2 " is that they blind us both to perverse effects of connectivity -- connectivity does not equal democratization , just like social capital does not equal a robust civil society -- and the fact that digital technologies have very different effects in different contexts			1
so while i have no problem acknowledging some changes in scale , what i oppose is the idea that , somehow , the effects of the " @entity2 " unfold to some trajectory that is visible to digital gurus in @entity130			1
the reason for putting " the @entity2 " in quotes is simply to indicate that we have accumulated too many myths to continue without harming our own ability to arrive at wise policy			0
@entity0 : i 'm struck by how easily modern technology can be circumvented -- not even by cutting wires or jamming transmissions but by sidestepping it entirely			0
( i recall some post- 9/11 war games in which a @entity143 officer had success by avoiding electronics in favor of messengers , handwritten letters and the like			0
) why are these lessons so hard for solutionists to learn ? @entity3 : let me guess : because solutionists spend far too much time with venture capitalists and far too little with people who actually use the technologies they build ? the @entity157 historian @entity156 has a wonderful book called " @entity159 , " where he shows that our accounts of technology suffer from the innovator 's bias : we do not spend nearly enough time looking at how technologies are actually used or maintained			1
if we did , we would discover that the pace of technological change is much slower and that many " analog " technologies have a much longer shelf life than the actual supermarket shelves would suggest			2
@entity0 : do we confuse convenience with solutions ? @entity3 : for much of its existence , design was all about convenience			1
we wanted to hide technology so that users are not distracted into thinking about the tools they use			2
to some extent , the current privacy debacle can be explained this way as well : we have built this thing called " the digital economy , " which runs very fast and is very efficient			2
but its efficiency is enabled by the fact that our personal data leaves our browsers and travels to some server -- @entity192 's or @entity193 's -- in the least obtrusive manner possible			1
is it good ? well , if all you care about is uninterrupted browsing experience , it is			0
but should n't there be other considerations ? @entity0 : many sites and apps make use of crowdsourcing and aggregation to rate products and services , boiling detailed critiques down to raw numbers			0
your thoughts ? @entity3 : we need to understand what exactly is being reduced as we transition from individual criticism to crowd criticism to -- soon , i 'm sure -- algorithmic criticism			1
it 's not a straight line toward progress and objectivity that digital gurus claim it is			1
it should be our task ( or at least my task as an intellectual ) to show that we are being sold damaged goods , that the mere fact that some things are being " disintermediated " does n't meant that we are transitioning to a superior cultural environment with better , more reflective criticism			0
@entity0 : in the book , you express concern about the @entity237 movement , those " datasexuals " who monitor every aspect of their lives			0
but is there anything wrong with the practice ? history is full of hard - core diarists and quantifiers			0
@entity3 : the scale today is clearly different			1
our smartphones are -- by default -- capable of the kind of monitoring that was previously unavailable to most			0
there 's also an interesting -- some would say disturbing -- economic layer here , as much of the data that we collect about ourselves can also be sold			1
my fear is that many institutions will eventually alter how they treat people who refuse to self - track			0
there are all sorts of political and moral implications here , and i 'm not sure that we have grappled with any of them			1
@entity0 : what are your thoughts on the @entity193 scandal ? @entity3 : i 've been warning about the utility of social media -- and digital infrastructure more generally -- for surveillance purposes for a very long time			1
so i ca n't fake surprise or outrage at the recent revelations			0
@entity0 : along those lines , you mention the many ways corporations provide incentives for us to offer our information ( or disincentives for opting out )			0
how do we say " no " when the economic benefits ( coupons , targeted sales ) are so attractive ? @entity3 : the problem is that we do n't say " no. " this marketizaton of personal information is a big mistake			1
we need to start seeing privacy as a commons -- as some kind of a public good that can get depleted as too many people treat it carelessly or abandon it too eagerly			0
what is privacy for ? this question needs an urgent answer			0
if my decision to earn a buck off my personal information will greatly constrain the lives of people in the next generation , should i sell my data ? i 'm not saying that it will necessarily result in more people choosing to share less			0
but the politicization of information sharing -- the act of turning it from a purely economic matter into an ethical one -- is a necessary start			0
@entity0 : how do you use the @entity2 ? what digital tools do you find useful ? @entity3 : ( a prelude : i do hope that this question will soon make as little sense as " how do you use electricity			1
" ) well , i use both to get things done ! " the internet " is not some separate realm -- it 's not a parallel universe that we enter under an identity that is different from our usual self ; it 's just a collection of services			2
does the data network through which @entity339 delivers my daily newspapers count as " the @entity2 " ? if it does , i use it quite a lot , as i get seven daily newspapers -- anything from @entity346 to @entity347 -- that way and perhaps a dozen magazines			0
but some of those i also read over my @entity352			0
i used to be a heavy user of apps like @entity355 , but to quote the famous computer scientist @entity356 , i find myself more and more inclined to get to the bottom of things , and spend more time with books ( i probably spend an hour a day on @entity361 buying new books , many of them online ) and more long - form writing			0
i have less and less use for the cloud -- not so much because of privacy concerns but because i just find the overall " always - on " proposition a hindrance to getting all the reading done			0
so i try to have days where , save for my @entity339 , there 's little contact with the " @entity2			2
" my fairly intuitive rule is simple : whatever allows me to get more reading done must be a rule / tool worth embracing .			0

author @entity3 questions technological " solutionism "
@entity3 : internet tools are *valuable* , but we should n't see a digital fix to every problem
there are lots of " political and moral implications " to quantifying data , he points out
@entity3 's book is " to save everything , @entity393 "
