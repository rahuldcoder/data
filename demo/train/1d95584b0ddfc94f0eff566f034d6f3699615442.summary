-- crashes had whittled the expected field from 22 to five , with wreckage from at least a dozen aircraft at one point strewn about the @entity7 airfield			0
but it did not deter between 300,000 to 500,000 from flocking to the @entity9 outside @entity10 for the final event , drawn by the rush of seeing planes turn , twist and race through the air -- and not deterred by the evident risk			1
that account , from the @entity18 @entity17 , was from 1909			1
more than 100 years later , air shows -- which may include air races -- continue to draw millions			1
in the process , they generate $ 110 million annually in the @entity18 and @entity24 alone , according to @entity25 , president of the @entity26			1
a spike this year in fatalities at such events has raised fresh questions about safety			2
but it has not detracted from the enthusiasm of many aviation enthusiasts , who still view such races as enthralling competitions			1
" it 's exciting , it 's incredibly moving to see these airplanes do what they do and handle the way they are , " said aviation analyst @entity38 , himself a former pilot in the @entity18 military and with @entity42 , who then compared it to its risks and thrills with auto racing and other sports			1
such danger was apparent friday , when pilot @entity57 's p - 51 aircraft plunged into spectators during a qualifying run at the @entity60 and @entity61 outside @entity62 , @entity63			2
nine people -- including the pilot -- were killed , with many more injured			0
a day later , @entity18 @entity66 lt. @entity65 said an aircraft crashed at a show in @entity69 , @entity70 , killing the pilot			1
@entity25 noted there had been at least 13 deaths at @entity18 air shows this year -- after none for 2009 and 2010			1
@entity75 , crew chief for the @entity77 racing team , watched @entity57 's @entity79 - era plane fly over his head , invert , go into a loop , then slam into the ground			1
he called the crash " very traumatic ( for ) the very close - knit " air racing community , be they people such as himself who knew @entity57 personally or other enthusiasts worldwide of the sport			1
still , he said it would not deter him from continuing to participate			0
nor would he hesitate to bring family members , as he has done often in the past , to watch planes race			0
" ( my kids ) love the air races , " said @entity75			2
" they realize it 's dangerous , that it 's not a sunday afternoon in the park			0
" air races are sometimes a part of , but distinct from , " air shows , " which generally are exhibitions in which pilots demonstrate aerobatics and other aerial moves			1
in a race , pilots compete against one another to see who can go fastest			0
there are several forms , the most high - profile being the @entity113 circuit in which competitors race against a clock and do aerobatic maneuvers , before being compared			0
its pilots come from around the world -- @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and beyond -- oft competing in picturesque locales in front of hundreds of thousands of people , including well over 1 million recently in @entity126			2
the @entity62 race , by contrast , was a lap race			0
competitors , typically five to eight at a time , fly a predetermined number of laps in large ovals that range from 3 to 8 miles , depending on the type of plane			0
and the fledgling @entity137 racing circuit is a head - to - head race that melds the two concepts while adding various safety measures			2
ceo @entity141 said he is currently criss - crossing the globe for meetings to set up future events			0
whatever the air race form , @entity141 said the common challenge is balancing the desire to maximize both excitement and safety			1
the latter becomes a bigger challenge than with conventional aircraft , since the pilots -- however well - trained -- are trying to push their planes to the limits			0
those involved in such events point out the numerous safety checks in place			0
only 320 pilots , for instance , are certified to fly in air shows , much less air races , said @entity25			1
and the @entity163 notes that its employees closely examine a race course , monitor pilots ' practice runs , examine their and their planes ' safety records and observe the races themselves			2
this is all in addition to pre-race inspections of the aircraft			0
still , as authorities learned again friday , there are limits to what can be done when pilots are trying to get the most from their aircraft -- especially if there 's an unanticipated mechanical failure			0
" an air race is a very , very high - speed race close to the ground with aircraft that have been modified to fly much faster than were originally designed to fly , " @entity38 said			1
" you can call this an extreme sport ( because the plane and pilot ) are being pushed to the absolute edge			0
" @entity192 , for one , believes that new technology can make such events safer without losing any of the sport 's luster -- something , he said , is needed to encourage more young people to go into aviation			2
and he thinks that , once the safety questions are answered , air racing should grow even more popular and take its place among conventional sports like baseball , soccer , golf and the like			1
" i think air racing will be the world 's predominant sport in 10 year 's time , " said @entity192 , anticipating it could be a huge spectator and revenue draw without heavy expenses such as building stadiums			1
" the challenge is ( balancing ) excitement and safety ... unless you achieve those two things , it 's hard to see how it becomes a global sport			2
" @entity0 's @entity225 contributed to this report .			0

air shows , which may include races , generate $ 110 million annually in the @entity18 , @entity24
the first air race was in 1909 , and today millions attend such competitions worldwide
there have been 13 air show deaths in @entity18 this year , an **official** says
an **official** predicts that air racing " will be the world 's predominant sport in 10 years "
