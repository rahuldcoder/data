nearly 400,000 people were deported from the @entity6 in the past fiscal year , the largest number in the history of the @entity4 agency , the government announced tuesday			1
the year - end removal numbers " underscore the administration 's focus on removing individuals ... that fall into priority areas " such as lawbreakers , threats to national security and repeat violators , the agency said in a news release			1
overall in fiscal year 2011 , immigration officials said , 396,906 individuals were removed			2
of these , 216,698 , nearly 55 % , had been convicted of felonies or misdemeanors			1
that 's an 89 percent increase of criminals from three years ago , the enforcement agency said			0
" this includes 1,119 aliens convicted of homicide ; 5,848 aliens convicted of sexual offenses ; 44,653 aliens convicted of drug related crimes ; and 35,927 aliens convicted of driving under the influence , " it said			2
the percentage was even higher for some regions			0
in the sector that covers @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , @entity42 , about 74 % of the 20,450 removals were of people with criminal records , said @entity46 of the agency 's @entity39 office			2
" smart and effective immigration enforcement relies on setting priorities for removal and executing on those priorities , " said agency director @entity49			1
" these year - end totals indicate that we are making progress , with more convicted criminals , recent border crossers , egregious immigration law violators and immigration fugitives being removed from the country than ever before			1
though we still have work to do , this progress is a testament to the hard work and dedication of thousands of @entity4 agents , officers and attorneys around the country			1
" the government said 90 % of the agency 's removals fell into a priority category and more than two - thirds of the other removals in 2011 were either recent border crossers or repeat immigration violators			1
the @entity77 reacted to the announcement by again criticizing the @entity81 administration 's emphasis on deportations			0
" all told , this administration has deported nearly 1.2 million people , leaving a wake of devastation in @entity90 communities across the nation , " @entity83 , @entity77 legislative counsel , said in a news release			0
" these record - breaking deportation numbers come at a time when illegal immigration rates have plummeted , the undocumented population has decreased substantially and violent crime rates are at their lowest levels in 40 years			1
" @entity83 also said the deportations represent " uncontrolled , unwarranted " spending of taxpayers ' money by the @entity102 , of which the immigration agency is a part			0
the department 's chief , secretary @entity105 , last week defended the administration 's polices as she gave advance notice that this fiscal year would end with a record number of removals			1
" what ... critics will ignore is that while the overall number of individuals removed will exceed prior years , the composition of that number will have fundamentally changed , " she said in a speech at @entity114			0
the @entity102 more than a month ago announced that the government would review about 300,000 deportation cases pending in federal immigration courts			0
lower - priority cases -- those not involving individuals considered violent or otherwise dangerous -- would be suspended under the new criteria			2
that change drew criticism from the other side of the immigration issue , with some people who favor more deportations characterizing it as a back - door amnesty program aimed at skirting the nation 's immigration laws			2
@entity137 said the approach is a common - sense way to tackle immigration problems with limited resources			0
" there has never been , nor will there be in these tight fiscal times , sufficient resources to remove all of those unlawfully in the country , " she said last week			0
" that is why it is so important to set clear priorities			0

@entity4 says the numbers show a focus on priority *groups*
