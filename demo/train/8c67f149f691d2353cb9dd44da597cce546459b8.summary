-- on monday afternoon , something called @entity2 was trending on @entity3			1
i had never heard of it , but was instantly amused by the word " bop			2
" you see , when i was a kid , @entity8 lived with us at home in @entity12 and she used to wield a giant cardboard wrapping paper roll that we affectionately called her @entity15			2
when our @entity16 , @entity17 , would annoy her , she 'd promptly try to beat the crap out of him			0
but @entity2 appeared to be far less amusing than @entity8 's cardboard bludgeoning stick			1
as one @entity23 put it : " @entity2 can go die in a hole			1
" whatever this @entity2 was people were n't happy , and i quickly pieced together from the cascade of angry tweets that it was a compilation children 's music series that had just aired a rather annoying commercial on @entity32 for its new upcoming release , " @entity2 22			1
" which suggests , perhaps , that somewhere in @entity36 there 's a parent who owns the other 21 disks and is slowly being talked off a ledge			2
" @entity41 , it 's going to be ok			2
we brought you some @entity44			0
" the @entity2 people tout their cds as " today 's biggest hits sung by kids for kids , " and this particular volume contains remakes of 16 pop songs that i 've absolutely never heard			1
sure , you may say i 'm old and unhip and completely out of touch , but , really , i just spend a lot of time watching " @entity57			0
" anyway , one song in particular on the new album that seemed to be immediately tugging at the gag reflex of most people on @entity3 was the @entity2 remake of " @entity63 " by @entity64 who , in 2007 , finished third on " @entity65			1
" which is exactly the same as " @entity67 , " except all the contestants have to sing while riding a moose			0
the chorus of @entity64 's song goes : " hey , i just met you			1
but here 's my number			2
so call me , maybe			0
" moral : " hey kids ... talk to strangers ! " now , while i totally understand people finding this song annoying , especially sung by children , i have to admit that , sadly , it 's also catchy as hell			1
and much better than my standard pickup line : " so , you ride @entity85 often ? " a while back , @entity86 actually praised " @entity63 " on @entity3 , which instantly made it popular , spawning video lip dub remakes by everyone from @entity90 to the @entity92 baseball team			1
and now it 's immortalized on " @entity2 22			1
the @entity2 music series is targeted to children aged 5 to 12 , and , according to its website , has sold more than 11 million cds. but i was curious as to just how " safe " they were making these songs			1
thus , i went all the way back to the beginning , the original @entity2 , and decided to examine their remake of @entity105 's " @entity104			1
" i figured it would be a good test subject since , so far as i can tell , the song is basically about being drugged and taken advantage of by a sexy @entity111 hooker			0
which , coincidentally , is also no. 32 on my bucket list			0
so , i purchased the @entity2 version off @entity115 and found that , at least for this one song , not a single lyric had been changed : " woke up in @entity118 in a funky cheap hotel / she took my heart and she took my money / she must 've slipped me a sleepin ' pill			1
" see ? this is why i have a dog			0
because i have no idea how to explain " @entity104 " to a child			0
" look , sweetheart , it 's complicated			2
so your mom and i rented you " @entity132			0
hey , at least i actually know " @entity104			0
" at the moment , all of my co-workers are making fun of me for just now learning about " @entity63			2
" and i could n't be more proud			0
so , if you need me , i 'll be at my desk listening to @entity44			0
or maybe watching " @entity57			0

in this week 's " @entity140 , " @entity139 takes on @entity2
the kiddie music series was trending on @entity3 after an ad aired on @entity32
what 's new ? kids now *warble* @entity64 's " @entity63 "
in *summation* : @entity2 is no " @entity149 "
