-- it takes quite a character to inspire a legion of women to draw thick black unibrows and mustaches on their own faces			2
six decades after @entity14 's death , her distinctive floral headwear , ornate dresses , and flash of red lipstick , still captivates some fans to the point of making themselves in her image			1
every time a major gallery launches a new exhibition of the @entity23 painter 's work , you can bet it will be accompanied by a queue of kahlo - lookalikes , said art historian @entity27			1
" it 's a real phenomenon , " said the curator of one of the biggest @entity14 exhibitions in the world , currently on display at @entity34 's @entity33			1
" i think people are most fascinated by her paintings -- @entity39 shows her inner life in a very authentic manner			0
and i think there are very few artists that have painted so much of what they really felt			0
" there 's a certain honesty , and that 's what people understand and feel			0
" queen of the selfie ? @entity14 's greatest muse was arguably herself , throughout her lifetime painting a huge number of self - portraits depicting deeply personal experiences in raw detail			1
from miscarriages , to a painful back injury which plagued her , the viewer is given a glimpse into the darkest depths of @entity14 's world			1
she once famously said : " i paint myself because i am often so alone , and because i am the subject i know best			0
" and in an age of the selfie , could @entity14 's self - portraits tell us something about people 's need to share their image with others ? " she told her friends : ' i give you this painting so that i am not so alone , ' " said @entity27			1
" so when people looked at pictures of her in their houses they thought of her , and it was like a white magic -- the more she painted herself , the more she spread her image among her friends , and the more these friends thought of her			0
" i think the people who dress - up as @entity14 today want to identify themselves with her because they feel there is a person who has been as lonely as them			1
there is a person who fought against this loneliness , who was strong enough to overcome their own problems			0
" a life less ordinary @entity14 's enduring allure is not simply due to her artwork , but a remarkable life which began in @entity99 in 1907			1
a horrific traffic accident as a teenager left her with lifelong back problems , and many of her self - portraits depict her body wracked with pain -- in one she wears a necklace of thorns , in another she is a deer pierced with arrows			1
her marriage to fellow @entity23 painter @entity112 -- 21 years her senior and a towering figure beside @entity14 's petite frame -- was a tumultuous one , the couple divorcing in 1939 and remarrying the next year			1
both had extramarital affairs , with @entity14 perhaps most famously engaging in a relationship with @entity121 revolutionary @entity120 , while he was in exile in @entity99			1
" in the beginning @entity39 was in @entity112 's shadow , but she very soon stepped out of it , " said @entity27 of the couple 's avant - garde art careers			2
" on their first trip to the @entity129 in 1930 , they had been married for one year , and already the press started to notice her appearance by his side as someone very attractive and spectacular			0
" when people came to their house to interview @entity112 , they saw her paintings , and saw that she was also very interesting			0
" in 1938 @entity14 had her first solo exhibition in @entity140			2
a year later her self - portrait " @entity142 , " was purchased by @entity143 in @entity144 , the first work by a 20th century @entity23 artist bought by the gallery			1
she had well and truly stepped out of her husband 's shadow -- professionally at least			0
frame of mind gaze across @entity14 's self - portraits and you 'll find an unsmiling woman with a harsh unibrow staring back			1
but the bold persona was all part of a carefully cultivated " masquerade , " says @entity27			0
" she 's dressing up in the @entity160 dress , which represents the matriarch in a certain part of @entity99 -- the strong woman who fights for her rights , makes her own money			2
she wants to represent this type of woman			0
" she pointed out her mustache and joined eyebrows because they show a male aspect to her personality , and @entity39 always wanted to be both			0
she wanted to be a complete human being and not only the sweet wife , so this makes her look so strong			0
" @entity14 died soon after her 47th birthday in @entity177 -- " the @entity177 " -- where she was also born , now a museum attracting thousands of visitors each month			2
the official cause of death was respiratory failure , set on by pneumonia			0
today , @entity14 's paintings sell for a whopping $ 5.6 million , her face adorns @entity99 's 500 - pesos note , and a 2002 @entity188 biopic of her life featured @entity190 in the @entity191 nominated lead role			1
major retrospective exhibitions of her work continue to draw huge crowds			2
and among them are the @entity14 lookalikes , who quietly contemplate their hero hanging on the wall			2
