-- running at full speed since the summer , a lab with the @entity2 , testing blood samples collected by @entity5 hospitals on patients they suspected of having @entity8 , has returned a negative result in every case			1
some public health officials are explaining the first confirmed case of the ebola virus in the @entity5 , found in a man in @entity16 , as a predictable event			1
but at least for this case , there are many questions surrounding that assertion			0
were crucial procedures that might have prevented the victim -- who @entity25 officials have identified as @entity27 , according to an article in the @entity29 -- from arriving in the @entity5 not in place ? have errors and missed opportunities put a handful of @entity16 residents at risk of an infection , with a roughly 50 % fatality rate ? as the facts roll out about @entity27 , who is fighting for his life in @entity16 ' critical care unit , we should scrutinize the travel screening procedures in use in the @entity5 and the apparently myriad ways @entity8 patients can slip through the cracks , even in one of the world 's most advanced medical systems			1
we know that airport screening efforts , such as they are , failed			2
@entity27 , traveling from the @entity8 - ravaged city of @entity52 , boarded a plane bound for @entity16 on september 19 after passing a screening that would have consisted of a few questions about symptoms and measurement of his body temperature			1
the effectiveness of the answers to screening questions depends entirely on the good faith we hold in the traveler 's truthfulness			2
as evidenced by numerous flights of returning aid workers and journalists , recent @entity8 contacts do not bar re-entry			2
reports now indicate @entity27 had such a contact			0
since infected @entity8 victims will remain asymptomatic for up to 21 days , does the screening procedure match up with the science ? in tuesday 's @entity2 briefing , dr. @entity76 , the @entity2 ' director , disclosed that @entity27 left @entity25 to visit family members living in the @entity5			1
we deserve more detail , because this choice is another possible point of intervention			0
are hops from this stricken region to destinations across the @entity87 for vacation and family get - togethers reasonable at this moment ? should travelers be required to describe a compelling reason to visit the @entity5 , when their choice to do so potentially affects others ? your questions answered i feel greatly for the quarantined @entity16 ambulance drivers and other community contacts whose lives are now upended as they wait in quarantine away from work life , income , and all other activities for three weeks			1
but it goes beyond lax screening : there is no effort to follow - up with potentially infected travelers after they arrive and begin circulating in @entity5			1
if checking in with a nurse via telephone every few days for three weeks sounds too expensive , why not charge an entry fee to cover that cost ? @entity8 is a novel threat			1
it 's time we think outside the box			0
beyond these screening and surveillance problems , critical medical errors have compelled the @entity2 to dispatch a team of epidemiologists and crisis control specialists to augment @entity124 public health resources			1
the mistakes that brought us to this point reveal the fragility of our much - vaunted @entity5 health care system when it comes to anything out of the ordinary			1
as a physician i can empathize with the emergency room providers at @entity136 who discharged their patient after an exam on september 26 with a course of antibiotics that are useless for his actual diagnosis			0
and it appears a nurse did inquire about recent travel , and @entity27 volunteered that he was from @entity25			0
but in a story all too common where medical errors are concerned , presbyterian hospital admitted on wednesday that this information was " not fully communicated " to all the emergency room practitioners caring for him			0
containing @entity8 depends on such truthfulness and cooperation			1
@entity2 epidemiologists performing the painstaking " contact tracing " of the patient 's movements for the four days he was symptomatic in the @entity16 community will depend on such openness from everyone they interview			0
( to that end , as bioethicist @entity163 points out , some of the rationale for patient privacy may need to be rethought , given the importance of identifying contacts			0
the @entity16 victim 's identity was a closely guarded secret by presbyterian hospital , due to long - established norms for controlling private health information			2
do those rules apply to a situation where contacts need to be identified urgently , and where the victim is at no risk of long - term stigma associated with a fast - moving disease process from which he will either survive and be noncontagious , or not ? @entity25 officials released @entity27 's name wednesday , irrespective of the hospital 's deference to privacy			0
this makes sense if public health is the priority			2
) but there was another error that had followed @entity27 's initial release from the @entity195 on september 28 , when he returned to @entity136 , this time deathly ill in an ambulance , the @entity195 staff immediately suspected @entity8 , @entity136 told reporters , and called in the infectious disease team			2
how then did the ambulance drivers and the ambulance itself continue in circulation , unquarantined , for the next 48 hours			0
hopefully no further errors will occur			0
to date , the four precedent - setting @entity8 patients brought to @entity5 soil for treatmentâ € ” at @entity208 and @entity210 's @entity209 -- have received their successful care in @entity2 - partnered units designed for just such a threat			1
now brave @entity16 health care workers will use the level of isolation seen at most " tertiary " care hospitals in the @entity5 , adequate even for airborne pathogens , which @entity8 is not , but not the ideal setting to provide a high level of isolation			1
to be effective in preventing contamination , workers will have to be more meticulous than usual , 100 % of the time , given the gravity of the infection			0
after @entity228 's @entity2 - affiliated unit at @entity208 successfully treated and discharged the first two @entity5 to receive care here for @entity8 , we learned about a disturbing lack of preparedness for handling the patient 's waste			1
federal agencies did n't take the lead in coordinating those hospitalizations , and that left logistical and regulatory hurdles , causing @entity242 workers to pile the waste in rubber barrels they rushed to purchase at @entity245 before ultimately sending them down the street to the @entity2 for proper disposal			2
the @entity16 hospital does n't have a @entity2 center down the street			0
let 's hope it gets the logistical support it needs from the get - go .			0

@entity258 : some say *discovery* of @entity8 in @entity5 predictable ; it did n't have to be
he says screening procedures out of affected nations and into @entity5 too lax
@entity258 : why not several weeks of health surveillance of travelers from those nations ?
@entity258 : truthfulness of travelers crucial , but hospitals also must be better prepared
