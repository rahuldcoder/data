-- the following five sites have proven the most consistently useful for the editors of @entity0 , who do thousands of searches a year			1
@entity0 editors reveal favorite online resources to book flights , hotels and other needs			1
@entity10 strictly for booking plane trips entirely outside of the @entity12 , such as a flight between @entity14 and @entity15			2
the site runs simultaneous searches of multiple airports serving the same city -- five airports in @entity21 , for instance -- and it retrieves fares from no - frills independent carriers like @entity26 and @entity27 , which many better - known travel sites overlook			1
that said , be warned that @entity30 does n't work nearly as well for booking airfares leaving the @entity12 @entity32 the all - time best site for finding the cheapest plane tickets in the @entity12 our biggest beef with @entity32 's competitors is that when you click to book a fare , they typically direct you to a new page			2
sometimes it 's only then that you find out your actual departure time -- or worse , you 're forced to plug in your dates and departure cities all over again , only to discover far different results			1
once you 've found a good flight on @entity32 , click on the price and you 'll be sent directly to the airline 's web site , where the exact price for the exact flight you selected unfailingly appears			0
another perk : if you are flexible on your travel dates , we recommend you try @entity32 's flexible - date search tool , which covers the broadest scope of routes and airports of any site we 've tested			2
@entity0 : staying in touch while on the road @entity64 the granddaddy discounter helps hotels , car - rental agencies , and airlines unload all sorts of inventory at well below published prices			1
we admit that @entity64 's name - your - own - price option -- in which travelers do n't know specific details until after their bids have been accepted -- is n't for everyone			1
but as flexible travelers , we 're fans of using @entity64 to bid blindly			1
you 'll find the best results when bidding for upscale hotels in large cities , paying up to half off what other guests pay			1
the trade - off is that your hotel 's location will be something of a surprise			0
but in many big cities , it does n't really matter which neighborhood you 're staying in , because you 're hopping all over town sightseeing anyway			1
of course , @entity64 also sells travel the straightforward way ( with the price and details quoted up - front ) , but , in our opinion , it 's no better at doing that than @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 or @entity105			1
@entity106 harnessing the power of the masses , the user - hotel - review site @entity106 is the top way to hunt for hotels			2
we admit that the site 's spectrum of good , bad and mixed reviews for the same property can be confusing			0
but you know what ? after reading the reviews and disregarding ones that seem off or biased , you get a decent sense of what to expect in a hotel -- which is the point			0
for now , @entity106 is the top dog in user - generated hotel reviews , but we 're also watching @entity32 - owned @entity128 , a newly - launched site that offers a similar service ( though to date it posts only about one - tenth as many reviews and opinions as @entity106 )			2
@entity133 spotlights independently owned properties overseas , many of which never show up on @entity12 travel sites			1
any booking site can point you to large , widely known hotels			2
but you might prefer to stay in a charming inn or a small property on your next trip , especially if you 're traveling to @entity145			0
well , @entity146 is the go - to source for this type of mom - and - pop lodging , which usually provides better value for the money than hotel chains			0
a recent search on @entity146 for hotels in @entity155 , @entity156 , for example , turned up 20 spots charging nightly rates of less than 60 euros ( $ 82 )			0
that 's well below the typical rates for large hotels in the resort town			0
@entity164 also offers other kinds of alternative lodging , such as apartments , pensions and farmhouses			0
