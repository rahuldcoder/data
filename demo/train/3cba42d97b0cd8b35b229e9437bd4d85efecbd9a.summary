editor 's note : @entity2 is the president of the @entity3 and president of @entity5 , a national trial consulting company			1
he has worked on the @entity6 and @entity7 cases and is the author of the upcoming book , " acquittal " , to be published by @entity11 , @entity12			0
in the courts and in society , we tend to think of racial bias as overt bigotry and imagine that the @entity19 and the @entity20 of the world hold negative stereotypes of other races and intentionally think less of them as people			1
actual bias , however , operates in the brain in a much different way			1
our acceptance of other people and cultures is a recent development in human history			1
the thousands of years of survival training we have acquired in our slow march up the homo sapiens ladder have taught us to fear and suspect others who do not look and act like us			0
wars and genocide have ravaged populations in such forms as the @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , the war in @entity46 , the @entity48 conflict , and the recently highlighted battles between @entity50 and @entity51 , all in the name of demographic differences			0
@entity54 wrote the " all men are created equal " language in the @entity57 while owning slaves			0
and despite the @entity60 , the @entity59 codified the oxymoronic " separate but equal " @entity62 laws in the @entity64 case only 33 years later			0
so , despite our noble desire to love our fellow man , we are all suspicious of " @entity67 " -- in this case , the young man in a hoodie in the rain			0
whether that figure comes in the form of a black teenager , a gay co-worker , the @entity78 neighbor , the overweight teacher , the barista with the tattoos and piercings , or , yes , even the gun owner , we all have biases			1
and yet most of us will never admit we have them , placing our own @entity87 - like bias - free self - image on a pillar of fairness and equity			1
but the truth is , the more we deny we have biases , the more we broaden and deepen those prejudices			1
@entity94 has denied he holds any racial animosity			1
and that may be true			0
but with his statements , " f * * * ing punks			0
these a * * holes , they always get away , " he may have been unconsciously referring to a combination of race , youth , behavior , and clothing			0
his frustration with the high crime rate in @entity110 , @entity111 , and the robberies in his neighborhood no doubt aggravated his need to " profile " the perpetrators he felt were victimizing his community			0
@entity120 , in saying he was being followed by a " creepy - ass cracker , " no doubt also racially labeled @entity94 out of fear			1
that is how all of our brains work			0
we categorize the characteristics of those who seem so different from ourselves that it makes us uneasy			0
and we do it without even thinking about it			0
there is a well - known principle in social psychology called ingroup - outgroup bias , which is the tendency to judge members of your own group more favorably and others more harshly			1
this has been followed by a great deal of recent research on " implicit bias " -- a subconscious negative association that we automatically attribute to others			1
both of these cognitive blind spots are dangerous because they run in the background of our minds , all day long , outside our awareness			0
so when juror @entity153 speaks to @entity155 about not finding @entity120 's friend @entity156 credible because she found her " hard to understand " and @entity156 was " using phrases i had never heard before , " it is obvious that it was hard for this juror to relate to this witness			1
and it is a combination of skin color , idiom , nonverbal behavior , and personality that causes this cultural outgroup divide , not just her race			1
this juror did not know about @entity156 's underbite , or that she grew up speaking @entity171 and @entity172 , or how those things affected her communication style , and thus could not relate to her			1
in her interview , juror @entity153 spoke about @entity94 's justified actions , his state of mind , her sympathies for him as well as the deceased @entity120			1
in jury selection , she spoke about the @entity110 protests before the trial as " rioting			0
" this juror could more easily relate to @entity94 as the neighborhood watch volunteer trying to protect his neighborhood			1
@entity156 , in her interview with @entity187 , said she believes that the situation was " racial " and @entity94 was " finally gon na get one			1
" some of @entity120 's supporters invoked @entity191 and @entity192 and criticized the racial makeup of the @entity94 jury			1
their comments , from their experiences , reveal the harsh reality of the world they live in			1
nearly 20 years ago , when i was working for the defense on the @entity7 case , much was made about the racial makeup of that jury ( made up of nine blacks , two whites and one @entity207 )			0
but again , it was not just the skin color of those jurors alone that determined that verdict			0
three - quarters of those jurors had personal experience with the police profiling , planting evidence , and engaging in other mistreatment			0
their experience , derived from their racial reality , obviously made them more receptive to the defense 's arguments about police misconduct			1
we see what we have experienced			0
so we see what we want to see , whether we are a white juror in @entity110 , @entity111 , or an @entity232 juror in @entity233			1
i have worked on more than a thousand trials and have watched jurors in hundreds of jury selections struggle to recognize their own biases and reconcile them with their desire to be impartial judges of facts and laws			1
in jury selection in the @entity94 case , jurors spoke about impressions they had already formed about the case , as well as their own experiences with crime and law enforcement			1
and while i do not question the @entity94 jurors ' fairness in deciding this case , fundamental psychology and common sense says that you are never fully able to " set aside " your experiences and the beliefs that you have held for years			1
in much of this country , this pervasive ingroup - outgroup implicit bias has allowed minority defendants to be charged and sentenced at statistically disproportionate numbers while the disparity is dismissed with excuses , a shrug , and a resigned " what are you gon na do ? " it has allowed institutional discrimination to occur in government , businesses , schools , and the courts , while politicians , executives , teachers , and judges vehemently deny its existence			1
and it has left a bitter legacy of disparate treatment of african - americans by mostly white juries			0
at the conclusion of this tragic case , we can divide again into camps of pro-martin or @entity288 advocates and bemoan the lack of racial progress			2
however , instead of just shaking our heads and speaking sadly about how far we still have to go in the area of race relations , let 's use this solemn opportunity to actually move the discussion forward			2
just the fact that there has been so much peaceful reflection after this verdict shows a great deal of progress			0
the @entity303 , the @entity304 , the @entity305 of the @entity306 , and the @entity3 have all recognized that these biases are a pernicious form of decay in our justice system , and these organizations are studying and implementing reforms in the courts			2
a @entity316 study in 2006 showed that diverse juries made better decisions because the different perspectives made them more thorough and less likely to make factual errors			2
while i am not criticizing this jury 's decision , the courts and local communities would all benefit from greater diversity			2
former police chief @entity327 significantly reduced inner city crime rates in @entity329 and @entity233 and improved police relations in minority neighborhoods by community policing policies that favored mediating differences instead of authoritarian strong - arm tactics			0
community courts are gaining favor as a way of building partnerships among residents , merchants , churches , and schools to address local safety and crime problems			0
@entity345 is not simple , and we should n't pretend it is			0
we also should not act as though it is a horrible monster that we should run from			0
it lives in all of us			0
we just do n't know it			0
the real question for us is not whether we have biases , but how our biases affect how we see and interact with strangers , standing scared in the rain in the middle of a gated community			2
so it 's time to stop pretending			2
it 's time to make implicit bias explicit			1
if we 're going to talk about race , let 's talk about race without resorting to platitudes , righteousness or defensiveness			2
it 's time to recognize that race is more than skin color			2
it is a rich tapestry woven with cultural , linguistic , behavioral and moral threads			0
it 's time to talk without judging			2
it 's time to listen without condemning			2
it 's time to admit and take responsibility for who we are			2
most importantly , it 's time to start understanding			2
if we really want this trial to mean something , we owe both @entity120 and @entity94 at least that much .			1

@entity2 : people see themselves as *unbiased* , but we all carry prejudices with us
@entity2 : juror 's comments showed divide between her and key witness
he says @entity94 , @entity120 expressed bias in remarks
it 's better to *confront* our biases than to keep *hiding* them , he says
