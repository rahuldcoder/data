-- after more than eight hours of being kept at bay by severe weather and low visibility , helicopter rescue crews found a way to rescue four hikers stranded in a raging @entity8 creek and ferry them to a waiting ambulance			1
" the @entity13 's helicopter was able to break through the weather system , and has successfully hoisted all four of them out , " @entity10 , a spokesman for the @entity11 , told @entity0 's " new day sunday			1
" " it was a very very risky rescue			2
it was quite a remote area			2
there 's absolutely no lighting there at all			2
the only lighting that we had was our rescuers with flashlights on their helmets and the ones that they were holding , " @entity10 said			1
" in the pitch black , it 's pretty difficult to find them			2
the creek was swollen and rising , and we were very concerned that they would be drowned where they were			1
" the rescue happened around 3 a.m. ( 6 a.m. et )			2
rising water , slippery surfaces and the sheer rock walls of the gorge made matters difficult , @entity10 had said earlier			0
before the decisive helicopter navigated through the skies , rescuers in rafts had been " inching " across @entity44 in a " high risk " attempt to reach the four , @entity10 said			1
earlier in the morning , the batteries in the hikers ' cell phone had died , but they were able to communicate that they saw the beams from the rescuers ' flashlights , even though the rescuers could not see the hikers			1
about an hour before the rescue , the @entity57 helicopter made it through the foul weather that had delayed it and " immediately spotted " the hikers			1
they were about 200 yards upstream from the rescue team , @entity10 tweeted			0
in messages sent before their cell phone batteries died , the hikers said they were cold but not injured , @entity10 said			1
temperatures overnight in the @entity68 were in the mid- 40s , and rescuers were concerned that hypothermia might become an issue for the hikers , @entity10 tweeted			1

106 million in path of latest winter blast mandatory evacuation orders severe rain that soaked much of southern @entity8 has subsided in many @entity81 suburbs , though residents of at least two communities remained under mandatory evacuation orders			1
authorities lifted a mandatory evacuation order for @entity86 early sunday , but others remained in effect for @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity0 affiliate @entity91 reported			0
so far , no deaths have been reported as a result of the rain			0

" the hillsides are already soaked right now , and it may not take much to cause those mudslides to just come down out of the hills			0
" the hills ca n't absorb water because so much vegetation was destroyed in wildfires and drought			0
walls of water have gushed into valleys below			0
they have spewed mud and debris into quiet residential streets , turning them into thick , brown creeks			0
" these areas have the highest risk of being impacted by flooding / debris flows from rainfall due to the loss of vegetation from the foothills , " the city of @entity89 said in a statement to @entity120 , also a @entity0 affiliate			0
little drought relief despite downpour the storms brought the first rains since the collapse of a powerful , persistent weather system that was keeping @entity8 parched , but they wo n't do much to alleviate the drought , according to the @entity136			1
a lot of the water is flowing out to sea , and the drought 's effects have been enormous			0
water reservoirs are running at minimum levels			0
