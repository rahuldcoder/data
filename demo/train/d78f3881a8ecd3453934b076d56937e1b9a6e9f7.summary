-- in popular culture , butlers are usually portrayed as " @entity3 " and tend to stately homes somewhere in the @entity6 countryside			2
the last few years has revealed a different reality , however			0
increasingly , " jeeves " and his ilk are as likely to be found managing a palace in @entity9 as a manor in @entity6			0
@entity14 , the owner of the @entity16 @entity15 , an elite butler training and staffing agency , estimates 25 % of his placements end up in the @entity19			1
" they like @entity16 servants more than anybody else , because i think they trust us , " he concedes			1
" a lot of wealthy @entity25 -- especially the royals -- go to boarding schools and university in the @entity16			1
by the time they 're in their 20s , they probably spent more time in @entity6 than their own country			0
" for someone like @entity14 , a self - professed traditionalist ( he balked when an @entity36 client once suggested he replace his tails with chinos ) , the @entity33 of the @entity19 are keepers - of - the - flame for the glory days of service			1
few @entity16 households hire the legions of staff depicted in @entity45			1
such retinues , however , are more commonplace in the @entity19			1
@entity47 , a butler who cut his teeth at @entity49 before founding @entity50 , his own butler recruitment firm , remembers working for one prominent family from the region			2
" we were at a property in @entity56 , and i was quite surprised the first time they had family visit			0
i looked out the window and counted 40 people lined up outside			0
this was for a family of two , " he recalls			0
" there are not many stately homes in @entity66 that would employ such a huge number of staff			2
" @entity47 also notes that while butlers stationed in the @entity19 can earn a decent income ( $ 150,000 for a top earner ) , the hours tend to be longer			1
the region can also prove isolating			2
" i worked in @entity9 for some time , and you have to adjust yourself to the fact that you have no social life , " says @entity14			0
" you ca n't go out for a beer and meet women			0
it just does n't happen in @entity9 or @entity80 , or other countries in the area			0
" still , he says , in many ways the nature of the work is less intense than in other parts of the world			0
" i do n't have to deal with drunks , or people whacked out on @entity91 ; i do n't have problems with prostitutes or gambling			0
those things are out the window in the @entity19			1
i worked for two royal families in strict @entity99 countries , and the day was so stress - free , i ca n't describe it , " he says			0
even outside of royal circles , the style of service founded by the @entity16 remains popular			1
several hotels in the region supply private butlers to every guest			1
according to @entity47 , the demand for these hotel butlers has " gone through the roof			2
" while private butlers remain fairly homogenous , in the hospitality industry , the demographic has changed considerably			0
as wealthy @entity116 and @entity117 tourists flock to the region , hotels are clamoring to offer the standard of service these guests have come to expect , in a language they understand			1
as a result , the face of butler service in the region is often , unexpectedly , @entity116			1
" due to the rapid growth of tourists from @entity116 , we needed to ensure the high level of customer satisfaction and have a strategy , " says @entity126 , a spokesperson at the @entity127 , which employs 200 butlers -- none of them @entity16			1
hotel management makes regular recruitment trips to @entity116 , and all staff are encouraged to learn @entity140			1
according to @entity142 , director of butler agency @entity143 , and @entity145 , a sister placement firm for nannies , some families hire @entity116 staff to give their children a headstart			1
" people think , ' ok , a lot of stuff happening in the world will be in @entity116 , ' and they want their kids to be ahead of the game , so they hire @entity140 - speaking nannies from us , " she says			2
despite a burgeoning supply from @entity116 and demand from the @entity19 , @entity161 , who heads up @entity163 and trains 600 @entity116 service staff yearly , says her students are often hesitant to make the trip			1
" many @entity116 parents are reluctant to let their offspring go to other countries			2
they prefer their young people to be chaperoned for safety , " she says , adding that the @entity19 's reputation for racial hierarchy does n't help			2
@entity14 , however , thinks the region offers enough perks to overcome most quibbles			0
" do n't let what you see on @entity180 shape your views , " he says			0
" if you keep an open mind , it can be a wonderful place to work .			0
