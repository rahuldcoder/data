-- following @entity2 's most recent rejection of @entity4 's bid , many may ask if this is a lost opportunity for @entity7 innovation , or the salvation of it ? i think both points of view miss the real story			1
the key challenge for the @entity7 is not about ownership structure , but about being a hub for the development of 21st - century medicines			1
to be sure , most of the @entity7 life science sector will be mightily relieved that @entity7 is still home to two of the global giants of biomedicine			1
but @entity7 must not become complacent about bioscience investment			1
to keep them and other companies investing here we need to continue the prime minister 's crusade to make the @entity7 the best place in the world for 21st century medicine design			1
to understand why , you need to understand the sector			0
having worked for fifteen years in the industry -- not for " @entity42 , " but for insurgent biotech companies and charities , who are increasingly the ones discovering most of the new medicines -- the controversy over the proposed merger was fascinating			0
it highlighted fundamental issues at the heart of the revolution transforming the pharmaceutical industry			0
the truth is that " @entity42 " is failing to develop enough new medicines			0
their old business model -- dependent on producing a steady pipeline of expensive " blockbuster " drugs to sell to @entity55 governments -- is broken			0
instead , these companies have now become reliant on the smaller and more innovative biotechs ( and increasingly charities ) to fill their pipelines with a new world of genetically targeted medicines			0
the pharma sector is radically changing , from being all about the discovery of old style drugs through biological research , to the design of personalized and genetically profiled drugs through research based more in hospitals than pharma factories			1
to succeed in this new world of 21st century biomedicine , the @entity7 has to unleash the unique power of its public health service the @entity76 -- a global powerhouse for modern drugs design			1
if we do so , we can deliver huge benefits to @entity76 patients , slow death rates in key diseases like cancer , reduce our drugs bill by making the @entity7 the fastest and best place in the world to develop , test and prove these new medicines -- which would allow us to pay a discounted rate -- and kickstart a 21st century life sciences cluster			1
it 's a massive prize			0
that 's why i was so pleased when the prime minister invited me to help the @entity7 set out our ground - breaking @entity96 in 2011 , which has been internationally welcomed			1
different companies are responding to this challenge in different ways			0
@entity2 last year electrified the sector by wholeheartedly embracing the @entity103 , embedding its staff in the @entity106 biotech and hospital campus			1
@entity4 , meanwhile , is known in the sector as the lead exponent of the m&a model : delivering shareholder returns by acquiring other companies			2
in either case , the success of the @entity103 was proved when both announced that after closing their respective factory plants in @entity117 and @entity118 , they were moving not to @entity106 , @entity119 , but @entity106 , @entity7			2
the fact that these companies are in the @entity7 , despite our becoming in recent decades one of the slowest and lowest priced purchasers of drugs , is testament to the model we have adopted			2
the truth is that we need to worry less about who owns these companies -- after all the shareholders in both cases are global , as is the management -- and more about their level of commitment to the @entity7 as a place to develop and sell modern medicines			2
we need to be rolling up our sleeves and making sure whoever owns the company has a strong commitment to the @entity7 for the right reasons , namely because it is the best place on earth to develop 21st - century medicines			2
@entity55 governments no longer have a right to expect or demand investment			0
we have to compete and win it by being more entrepreneurial			0
the truth is that what really matters is that the @entity7 remains a world - class place to discover and develop new 21st - century medicines			2
if we get that right , we can be relaxed about where the capital and talent flows from			0
without it , we wo n't have any takeovers to debate			0
the very possibility of the takeover was a tribute to the @entity7 as a place where people want to do business			1
for the physical and economic health of us all , long may it remain that way			0

mp @entity177 says the failed @entity4 bid for @entity2 is not a lost opportunity
instead , it ensures a focus on the crusade to make the @entity7 a hub for medicine design
@entity177 says the @entity7 must look to its public health service to boost research
that will ensure the debate continues to be around doing business in the @entity7
