@entity0 -- a @entity3 chef who has worked in @entity4 for six years claims his work visa was denied because of his obesity			1
but @entity4 immigration authorities say the visa was denied because the man " no longer had an acceptable standard of health , " that his ability to work was in question and that there is potential " high cost " of his healthcare			1
@entity18 , 50 , as described by his wife , has " always been on the larger side			0
" and the 278 - pound man ( 126 kilograms ) says he struggles with his weight			1
so how did a chef who specializes in @entity3 cuisine get caught in the crosshairs of two major controversies -- immigration and obesity ? " i am a chef , not a politician and i do not want to be the poster child for immigration issues -- but i have become that i feel , " he told @entity1			1
" i just want to work and live here			2
" after @entity34 and his wife arrived in @entity4 in 2007 , they were granted subsequent visitor and work visas			1
they settled in the city of @entity40 and @entity18 found work at a restaurant , the @entity43 , where he became known for his " curry of the day			2
" their run - in with immigration began when the couple applied for @entity4 residency in 2011			1
to qualify for residency , @entity18 had to take several medical tests			0
after the exams , the immigration authorities found that " he did not have an acceptable standard of health			1
" although @entity18 withdrew his residency application , his health information was now on record			2
in may , @entity59 rejected his work visa application for health reasons			1
@entity59 did not cite @entity18 ' weight for rejecting his work visa			1
the agency stated in a media release that obesity alone is not enough to fail the country 's required health screenings			1
instead , it cited a litany of @entity18 ' obesity - related complications and stated that he had evidence of chronic knee joint condition , impaired glucose tolerance and enlarged fatty liver			1
the agency noted that a replacement surgery for @entity18 ' knee joint condition could cost over us $ 16,000 ( nz $ 20,000 )			0
" the applicant 's ability to work is affected by the chronic knee joint condition that he suffers from , " the agency stated			2
it also listed his " significant risk of obesity complications " as diabetes , hypertension , heart disease , obstructive sleep apnea , some cancers and premature joint diseases			1
the agency 's medical assessors " have to consider to what extent there might be indications of future high - cost and high - need demand for health services			1
" @entity4 has a public health system , which is free or low cost to users because of government subsidies			1
also the country 's immigration policy states that people with a body mass index over 35 are not likely to meet health requirements due to health risks			1
@entity18 agrees with the notion that countries have to protect their taxpayers from high health expenses			2
" i see no problem with potential immigrants being screened for risks to either national health or maybe becoming a financial burden on the taxpayers , " he said			2
" all countries do that			0
" but he said they would 've wanted to know sooner			0
he said they 've already put down their roots in @entity4			1
@entity18 was heavier at 353 pounds ( 160 kilograms ) when he first arrived to @entity4			1
now 75 pounds lighter , @entity34 said he was never warned about not meeting an " acceptable standard of health " until about a year ago			1
the only previous mention of his weight was when he applied for residency and an agent warned them that " @entity59 is very strict on weight and that it was unbelievable that i was actually given a work visa in the first place			1
" the couple has filed an appeal to @entity59 , which they expect to hear back in two weeks			0
his doctor has written a letter of support , stating that @entity18 had brought his cholesterol and blood pressure under control and that his @entity147 is high because of his build			0
since may , the couple have had to stop working because they are considered illegal aliens -- which has thrown their lives into turmoil			0
" we 've been kicked out of our home			0
we 're in the process of losing our phones , we 're going to be cut off			0
we 're living with my sister , " he said			0
" it hurts your pride , it 's humiliating			0
" the couple hopes to remain in @entity4 as their relatives live there			1
" we committed no crime and did nothing wrong other than my husband being a foodie , " wrote @entity34 , his wife			0
" we also feel that this situation is treated very lightly while it should be abundantly clear to the officials involved with our case that the situation is urgent			0
" countries are limited in what health screening measures are applied to short - term visitors			1
but the @entity180 , a legally - binding international agreement to prevent the spread of diseases , allows countries to apply additional screenings for people who seek long - term residence because of health expenses picked up by the nation 's services			1
@entity190 , professor of @entity191 and @entity192 at the @entity193 , said in an era of growing waistlines and soaring health costs , tough policy decisions have to be made			2
" i think governments are looking for ways to reduce the health care cost burden on the population on the taxpayer , " he told @entity1			2
" so they 'll be looking at all sorts of ways to do that			0
i do n't think it 's an easy call			0
there are issues on both sides , there 's also population and government decisions			0
sometimes , they 're a bit tough			0
there are no winners , i 'm afraid			0
" more than a quarter ( 28 % ) of @entity4 are considered obese , which is considerably lower than the @entity219 ( 35.7 % )			2
this is not the first time @entity4 has made headlines on this issue			2
in 2009 , a 297 - pound @entity219 woman was denied residency there because of her obesity - related complications , according to the @entity227			1
the medical assessor concluded that the woman , who was morbidly obese and diabetic , would cost the health service more than us $ 19,985 ( @entity230 $ $ 25,000 ) over four years			2
" there 's always been a restriction on immigration based on health issues , so the basic principle has always been , if you 've got a major health problem that 's a drain on the state , that counts against you in immigration , " @entity231 , professor of medicine and nutrition at @entity234 in @entity4 , told @entity1			1
" i do n't think that 's unique in many countries			0
" countries can test immigrants for infectious diseases like sexually transmitted diseases ( @entity250 ) or tuberculosis , but the difference is that countries also want to determine beyond potential infections to the economic cost for the state , he said			0
" if someone says to me , ' is your risk greater from a whole range of medical issues because of obesity ? ' yes it is			2
i may not like the prejudicial label attached to it			0
it 's a true fact , " @entity231 added			0
@entity264 reported and wrote in @entity0			0
@entity265 reported in @entity266 .			0
