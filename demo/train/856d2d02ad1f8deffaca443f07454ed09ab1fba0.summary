-- the debut of the tiny $ 35 @entity3 computer crashed its distributors ' websites on the way to selling out within hours of launch			1
looking like little more than a credit card - sized chip of circuit board , the powerful , fully - programmable pc can plug into any tv and can power 3d graphics and @entity15 video playback			1
its @entity17 - based designers at the @entity18 hope the computer , which has been in the works for six years , will spark new interest in programming among children			1
" the primary goal was to build a low cost computer that every child could own , and one where programming was the natural thing to do with it , " said co-founder @entity24			2
the computer 's miniature uncased circuit board is crowded with an @entity33 connection for the internet , two usb ports and an sd card port for memory and is powered by a standard usb mobile charger			2
the low - cost computer runs a free , open - source @entity41 operating system and does not include a monitor or keyboard			2
the first version of the @entity3 will ship soon to developers , and the hope is that they will design software that will enable children to design their own computer programs			1
the project came about when a group of @entity53 - based computer programmers noticed that fewer and less - qualified students were applying for computer science courses at @entity53			0
inspired by computers like the @entity59 and the @entity60 in the 1980s , the group of engineers set out to build a new programmable machine for a new generation			0
" each year we had fewer and fewer students applying , and most of them had n't really done much more than write a web page , " @entity3 co-founder @entity63 told @entity0			0
" so we kind of set out to recreate that feeling of the @entity59 in the hopes it would spark a new wave of kids knowing how to program			0
" @entity63 told @entity0 that an even cheaper version of the computer , which will retail for just $ 25 , is going into production within the next several weeks			1
in the long term , he hopes the computer will generate an additional 1,000 engineers in the @entity17 each year -- an " industry - changing development " , according to @entity63			0
" anyone who expresses a desire to get into designing software should have a platform to do it , " he said .			0

$ 35 credit card - sized @entity3 computer sells out within hours of launch
