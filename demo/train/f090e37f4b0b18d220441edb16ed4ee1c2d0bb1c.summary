-- a few years ago a group of us were having dinner at a steakhouse , and among the people at the table were the terrific sports columnist @entity7 and his wife , @entity8			2
the manager of the place came over to say hello ; introductions were made			1
at one point in the evening i was making my way to the men 's room and ran into the manager again			1
i said to him , " that @entity8 you met ? i think you 're probably familiar with her late father			2
" " who was her dad ? " the man said			2
" his first name was @entity26 , " i said			2
within minutes the taped music that had been playing in the restaurant stopped , and a new tape was substituted -- a @entity31 tape			1
any steakhouse worthy of the name has his music on hand			2
there it was , coming out of the ceiling : " you 're nobody till somebody loves you			2
... " and just the sound of it -- just that instantly recognizable deep tremolo of @entity31 's voice , so warm and easy and seemingly effortless -- had an effect on the room			1
it was as if someone had sprayed some kind of invisible muscle relaxant into the air			2
people visibly loosened up , they smiled a little more , it was like a friend had arrived and had said : quit worrying about things			2
life does n't have to be so serious			0
he 's been gone for more than 16 years now -- he died on christmas day , 1995 -- yet he seems to get only bigger as the years go by			1
i 've been noticing it in recent days : that voice keeps drifting out of radios , out of television sets , out of hidden speakers in malls and coffee shops and clothing stores ... it 's as if his voice , and his face , have by some sort of silent national acclamation been voted the quasi-official antidote for tense times			1
in a lousy mood ? that changes as soon as you hear : " when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie			0
... " the coolness of @entity31 seamlessly crosses generations ; young guys heading for a weekend in @entity86 with their buddies understand his appeal just as viscerally as their grandparents do			1
he never , in life , actively campaigned for this role -- the eternal model of coolness -- and in death it has just seemed to be bestowed upon him naturally			1
his friend @entity96 may have liked the image of being @entity98 , but the core of @entity31 's enduring allure is that not only did he not want to be chairman , he did n't even want to serve on the board : it would mean that he would be cooped up in some boardroom for meetings when he 'd rather be out playing golf			1
the sight of him in a tuxedo -- he wore it as comfortably as most men wear a pair of pajamas -- says to people who were n't even born when he was at the height of his fame : take a deep breath and let yourself grin			0
your problems can wait until tomorrow			0
he did n't like to rehearse , his friends said , because he knew he would do just fine without it			0
as he grew older he did n't feel the need to endlessly seek out applause , because he had been so famous for so long -- his nightclub and motion picture partnership with @entity129 , his own movie career , the @entity131 years , his success as the host of his television shows , his sold - out concerts -- that he 'd heard enough ovations to last a lifetime			1
his ease onstage made his audiences feel at ease , too ; he seemed as at home in front of a packed @entity144 crowd as he was in the den of his own house ( his line at catching his first glimpse of an audience : " how did all these people get in my room ? " )			1
it had been a while since i 'd talked with @entity8 , but i called her the other evening , and she told me that , like the rest of us , she is forever encountering her dad 's voice unexpectedly in public places : " it 's always reassuring , it 's always nice			1
i was in a store one holiday season , and there was a @entity162 tape playing			0
a choir of some sort was singing a @entity165 , and that ended and then there was my dad : ' oh , the weather outside is frightful ... ' i just smiled a quiet smile			0
" she said the reason he appeared so relaxed while working was because it was n't an act			0
" nothing seemed to bother him			0
and if something ever did , he sure was n't going to bother anyone else with it			0
" she said that when she was a girl and was in a bad mood at home , her dad , in that voice of voices , would say to her , without a bit of rancor : " go up to your room if you 're going to pout			0
come on back down when you 're happier			0
" in @entity193 the other night i was walking along the street and thought i heard him singing			0
it was a restaurant with an outdoor terrace ; a local duo -- they billed themselves as @entity96 and @entity26 â € ” was performing in front of one of those digital music machines that can replicate the sound of a full orchestra			0
the shorter of the two was singing @entity96 songs , the taller was doing @entity31			1
the physical resemblance was n't really there , but the songs were right			0
whenever it became the @entity26 imitator 's turn for a tune , he would jack the vibrato in his vocals into overdrive : " everybody loves somebody sometime ... " and the thing is , the people at the cafe were gravitating toward him			1
they were on their feet , beaming , moving closer to the microphone , some of them dancing , some just blissfully staring , seduced by the sound			0
the singer looked as if he was accustomed to getting this reaction			0
it turns out that it 's cool to be @entity31 even when you 're not really @entity31			1
@entity233 n't that a kick in the head ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			1

@entity238 says the coolness of @entity31 seamlessly crosses generations
he says the *crooner* 's calm , cool *delivery* slows everything down
@entity238 : @entity31 's ease on stage made audiences feel at ease too
