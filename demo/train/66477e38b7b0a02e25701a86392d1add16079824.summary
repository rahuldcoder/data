editor 's note : @entity2 is an international human rights lawyer , founder of @entity4 , and contributing editor for @entity6 in @entity7			2
@entity2 says @entity8 made progress in improving relations with @entity12 world			1
( @entity13 ) -- opening the muslim - world leg of the " @entity22 " world tour with the universal @entity17 greeting " @entity18 " ( may peace be with you ) to thunderous applause , president @entity8 began his long - awaited major address by going straight to many of our pressing geopolitical issues			1
he spoke from the hallowed halls of @entity28 in the heart of one of the largest @entity17 capitals in the world			2
from beginning to end , president @entity8 's speech was a concert of enlightenment compared to president @entity38 's famous farewell news conference in the @entity12 world ( which resulted in two @entity41 size - 10 shoes being boomeranged toward his head )			1
from the issues of violent @entity12 extremism to the growth of the neo-racism known worldwide as @entity47 ; from @entity49 - @entity48 to his overall @entity41 and " @entity51 " ( @entity52 ) strategy , president @entity8 successfully used his @entity54 speech to lay out his framework for several key foreign policy issues			1
additionally , with major sections of his address covering women 's rights , democratic reforms and nuclear weapons , president @entity8 devoted much of his 40 - plus - minute speech to offering concrete and tangible policy initiatives that he plans to implement in the near future			1
he talked about his plan " to invest $ 1.5 billion each year over the next five years to partner with @entity67 to build schools and hospitals , roads and businesses " to help the countless number of internally displaced persons caught in the fighting in @entity52			0
similarly , for @entity52 , he outlined that we will be " providing more than $ 2.8 billion to help @entity76 develop their economy and deliver services that people depend upon			0
" aside from his concrete foreign policy proposals and tangible development initiatives , president @entity8 spent much of his @entity54 address highlighting the " common aspirations " of the @entity84 and the @entity12 world			1
he surprisingly cited the @entity86 at least four times in his speech and noted that the first @entity89 elected to the @entity90 , @entity91 of @entity92 , " took the oath to defend our @entity94 using the same @entity86 that one of our @entity96 -- @entity97 -- kept in his personal library			0
" wow , that is quite a change from your past political interactions with @entity102 , mr. president			0
as most @entity12 - @entity84 vividly remember , during the 2008 presidential election , when certain nasty and xenophobic right - wing elements in @entity84 tried to paint @entity8 as some kind of " @entity12 " @entity108 candidate , we did not see then - candidate @entity8 go , even once , within 12 feet of an @entity84 mosque entrance or @entity12 political campaign event			1
during the 2008 presidential election , the " @entity12 " insinuation against @entity8 became so radioactive that two @entity89 women in @entity114 were asked to sit out of camera range at an @entity8 campaign event in @entity117 by campaign volunteers in june 2008 simply because the two women wore hijab , the traditional headscarf			2
but i guess when in @entity54 addressing the greater @entity12 world , an @entity84 president has to be wise enough to talk , and walk , like an @entity125			1
on the essential need for a diplomatic , peaceful and final resolution to the @entity129 - @entity49 situation , president @entity8 reaffirmed his commitment to a two - state solution on the condition that " @entity133 must put an end to violence " and that " the @entity84 does not accept the legitimacy of continued @entity49 settlements			2
" by successfully addressing the major foreign policy issues affecting much of the @entity17 world today , president @entity8 has succeeded in positioning the @entity84 closer to a rapprochement or political d√©tente with the @entity12 world			1
the @entity8 administration can bring some further resonance to the president 's eloquent words by making sure that key administration players like secretary of state @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 -- @entity8 's special envoys for the @entity51 and @entity49 - @entity129 portfolios , respectively -- further carry out the president 's foreign policy agenda			1
. finally , in the spirit of his event , president @entity8 concluded his remarkable @entity54 address by highlighting the individual mandates for peace in each of the major @entity161 religions			2
he said that , " @entity86 tells us , ' o mankind ! we have ... made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another			0
' ... the @entity168 tells us : ' the whole of the @entity170 is for the purpose of promoting peace			0
... ' " " @entity174 tells us , ' @entity173 are the peacemakers , for they shall be called sons of @entity177			0
' ... the people of the world can live together in peace			0
we know that is @entity177 's vision			0
now , that must be our work here on @entity186			0
" @entity188 , mr. president			0
