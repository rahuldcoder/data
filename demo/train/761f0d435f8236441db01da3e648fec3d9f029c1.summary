@entity0 -- some plutonium found in soil on the grounds of the @entity8 nuclear power plant may have come from its earthquake - damaged reactors , but it poses no human health risk , the plant 's owners reported monday			1
the element was found in soil samples taken march 21 - 22 from five locations around the plant , the @entity11 told @entity1 late monday			1
the company said it was equivalent to the amounts that fell on @entity19 following aboveground nuclear weapons tests by other countries in past decades			1
" it is not a health risk to humans , " the company said			2
but it added , " just in case , @entity11 will increase the monitoring of the nuclear plant grounds and the surrounding environment			1
" plutonium is a byproduct of nuclear reactions that is also part of the fuel mix at the plant 's no. 3 reactor			0
it can be a serious health hazard if inhaled or ingested , but external exposure poses little health risk , according to the @entity43 @entity42			2
three plutonium isotopes -- @entity45 , -239 and -240 -- were found in soil at five different points inside the plant grounds , @entity11 reported			2
it said that plutonium found in two of the samples could have come out of the reactors that were damaged by the march 11 earthquake and tsunami that ravaged northern @entity19			0
all three isotopes have long half - lives , with plutonium - 239 taking 24,000 years to lose half its radioactivity			0
@entity45 has an 87 - year half - life , while plutonium - 240 's is more than 6,500 years			0
the company said the discovery would not change efforts to bring an end to the crisis at the plant , where three of the six reactors are believed to have suffered damage to their radioactive cores			0

the amount found is comparable to *fallout* from old nuclear tests
@entity11 says the discovery poses no risk to humans
but company says it will increase monitoring " just in case "
