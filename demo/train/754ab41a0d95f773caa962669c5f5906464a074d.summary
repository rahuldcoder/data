-- there have always been great moments in global events that changed world history			1
on july 4 , 1776 , @entity5 signed the @entity6 and began their march toward democracy			1
on september 2 , 1945 , @entity9 mercifully ended when @entity10 surrendered after more than 50 million had died during that brutal conflict			1
and on november 9 , 1989 , the people in occupied @entity13 took control of their own destinies when they literally hammered the @entity16 to the ground			1
it is hard to recapture the breathtaking drama of that period in @entity21 25 years ago			1
throughout 1989 , there were clear signs that the @entity24 was crumbling			1
in @entity26 , @entity27 and elsewhere , popular movements successfully challenged @entity24 - backed regimes that had long since lost their legitimacy			2
but nowhere was the drama greater than in @entity13 and @entity31 , the epicenter of the @entity33			2
since august 13 , 1961 , when @entity13 erected the terrible barrier that cut off @entity36 from @entity37 and @entity13 , the wall became a dreaded symbol of isolation and despair			2
family members were separated , and for the next quarter of a century , more than 100 @entity42 were killed trying to escape past the wall			2
then , on october 9 , 1989 , more than 70,000 @entity13 gathered outside the @entity45 in @entity46 carrying candles of peace and chanting , " @entity49 ! " we are the people ! demonstrations were followed by more and larger protests , in @entity46 and around @entity13			1
precisely one month later , the @entity16 fell			1
the @entity5 had long supported @entity42 unification and we backed the efforts of chancellor @entity55 and other @entity42 leaders to move toward rapid political and economic integration of @entity13 into the @entity58			2
of course , there were international complications : @entity24 leader @entity61 had signaled that the @entity62 would not act militarily to stop unification			2
so it was still important to find ways for @entity61 to fend off criticism from @entity67 hardliners			0
moreover , @entity69 's @entity68 and @entity71 's @entity70 were initially skeptical about a unified @entity13			0
to deal with these concerns , we developed the " two plus four talks			0
" under this formula , the two @entity42 governments negotiated the internal terms of reunification while the four occupying powers -- the @entity5 , the @entity62 , @entity71 and @entity69 -- addressed its international aspects			0
the successful talks resulted in the @entity82 signed by all six parties in @entity84 on september 12 , 1990			0
that treaty ended the limitations on @entity42 sovereignty that had existed since @entity9 the leadership role president @entity89 played in @entity42 unification was pivotal , but @entity55 and @entity61 also played truly decisive roles			0
the former brought immense passion and creativity to the process			0
the latter , despite bitter opposition by reactionaries at home , remained committed to a resolution without bloodshed			0
above all , though , unification was achieved by the @entity42 people , in @entity46 and elsewhere , who never lost faith in freedom and never lost hope for the future			0
looking back , one of president @entity89 's outstanding traits has been his humility , and particularly his insistence after the @entity114 fell that @entity5 not gloat about our victory in the decades - long @entity33 against the @entity24 empire			1
in 1989 , after all , the president still had further business to do with @entity24 leaders , even as their country was rapidly imploding			0
included on his checklist were nuclear arms reductions , which were later accomplished and have played a critical role in maintaining world peace			0
time and time again , president @entity89 demanded that we not dance on the ruins of the @entity16			1
he simply would n't hear of it			0
but 25 years later , on november 9 , 2014 , we should all enjoy a celebratory jig to commemorate what happened on that fateful day			1
that magical moment is a reminder to all people everywhere in the world -- those alive then , today and well into the future			1
tyranny can not suppress the will of those yearning for freedom and desiring a better life for themselves and for their children .			0
