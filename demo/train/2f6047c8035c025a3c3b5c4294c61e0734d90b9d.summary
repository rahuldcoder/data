in @entity36 , riot police fired warning shots and tear gas early thursday outside the @entity39 in @entity40 to keep hundreds of protesters back from the compound walls , with minor injuries reported			0
protesters also gathered in @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and elsewhere			0
the clashes follow tuesday 's attack on the @entity9 @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , that left ambassador @entity53 and three other consular officials dead and has heightened tensions at @entity9 diplomatic missions across the region			1
six things to know about the attack thursday morning , several thousand @entity1 protesters gathered outside the @entity39 in @entity0 , with some flooding the security perimeter and penetrating the embassy 's wall , according to a statement released by @entity1 through its embassy in @entity66 condemning the incident			1
" security services have quickly restored order to the embassy 's complex			2
fortunately , no casualties were reported from this chaotic incident , " it said			0
however , after a lull following the breach of the embassy wall , anger appeared to rise again as the day wore on , and security forces began to use more force to try to control the crowd			2
@entity9 increases embassy security worldwide after @entity52 attack there were fewer than 100 protesters by lunchtime , and tensions had eased , but their numbers rose to several hundred after water cannons were used against the crowd			2
security forces were given permission to shoot anyone seen with weapons near the embassy , two @entity92 officials told @entity2 , and gunshots were heard in the area			2
by evening , the protesters , armed only with sticks and stones picked up from the street , had decreased in number and had been pushed back to about 300 yards from the embassy			0

" he said there had been no evacuation			0

@entity1 human rights activist @entity132 , who was not part of the protest but watched events from a nearby rooftop , told @entity2 he thought what had happened was " really wrong			2
" " there were calls on social media to protest today in front of the embassy , so i expected there might be some violence and clashes , but did n't expect it would be that easy to break into the embassy , " he said			0
@entity149 's killing shines light on @entity152 sensitivities around @entity4 " i 've been there -- it 's one of the most protected places in @entity1			1
to break in that easily was a shock to me			0
" @entity9 secretary of state @entity157 condemned the video thursday as " disgusting and reprehensible " but said there was no justification for responding with violence			2
" it is especially wrong for violence to be directed against diplomatic missions , " she said			0
" these are places whose very purpose is peaceful , to promote better understanding across countries and cultures			0
" in a statement released through the @entity115 in @entity66 , president @entity170 apologized to his @entity9 counterpart , @entity173 , and the @entity9 people for the attack on their mission in @entity0			1

" his statement , which spoke of " warm relations " between his country and the @entity9 , said divisions among @entity1 security and military forces helped create an atmosphere where such disturbances could erupt			1
over the past several months , @entity170 has sought to restructure @entity1 security forces and remove loyalists to former president @entity192 from their posts			1

" an emergency message on the website of the @entity39 in @entity0 warns of the possibility of further protests in the coming days , particularly near the embassy , and urges @entity9 to leave the country			1
reaction to anti-islam film fuels debate on free speech vs. hate speech " as staffing levels at the @entity115 are restricted , our ability to assist @entity9 citizens in an emergency remains limited and may be further constrained by the fluid security situation			1
" @entity230 of security analysis group @entity231 's told @entity2 the current protests were reminiscent in some ways of the outpouring of anger in 2005 after the publication in @entity237 of cartoons seen as disrespectful to @entity4			1
the violence also reflects the changed dynamic in the region following the @entity242 , @entity230 said			0
" you 've got populations in all of these countries who are now much more willing to take to the streets and are much more wiling to vocalize their anger in a much more violent way , " he said			0
" my guess is that this outpouring of anger will be intense but brief , but i think there is a danger that this anger will spread to perhaps more unpredictable places like @entity257 and @entity258			0
