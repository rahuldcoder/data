-- scientists have found a wide - eyed primate -- a clawed fur ball that fits snugly in one hand -- in the first live sighting in more than 80 years of a creature that some thought was extinct			1
" it was truly amazing , " one scientist said			1
" i could n't conceive that we had actually caught one			1
" over a two - month period , scientists working in @entity13 on the @entity15 island of @entity16 caught and released three pygmy tarsiers			1
they bear a striking resemblance to the @entity19 , an electronic toy that spoke its own fantasy language and dominated children 's wish lists in the late 1990s			1
they caught two males and one female , said @entity27 , a @entity28 anthropology professor who led the expedition			1
the group spotted a fourth -- high in the tree canopy -- but were unable to catch it			2
the species had not been observed alive in more than eight decades , since they were collected for a museum in 1921			1
many scientists had believed them to be extinct until eight years ago , when two scientists trapping rats in @entity16 accidentally trapped and killed one			1
" i needed to go myself ... to confirm in my own mind , " whether they were there , @entity27 told @entity0 on wednesday , after recently returning from @entity15			2
and , on the second night of trapping in august on moss - covered , chilly @entity42			2
@entity43 , her group caught the first small nocturnal creature in a mist net			1
" it was truly amazing , " she said			2
" my whole body was shaking ... i could n't conceive that we had actually caught one			1
" the second trapping did n't come until three weeks later , but that first sighting " kept us going , " @entity27 said , amid the cold , drenched conditions			0
the pygmy tarsier , or @entity55 , weighs about 50 grams ( 1.7 ounces ) , and has dense fur , large , protruding eyes			2
in addition to seeming as a living , breathing version of the @entity19 , it also appears as though it ought to have had appeared in the 1984 movie " gremlins			0
" unlike other primates , the pygmy tarsier -- endemic to a specific area of @entity15 -- has claws instead of nails on its fingers			2
it is half as big as the @entity72 tarsier , which has similar features			0
for their part , the pygmy tarsiers may have been more frightened than elated at being discovered			1
" i was bit once , but i take responsibility for that , " @entity27 said , explaining that the animal nipped her as she was trying to attach a radio collar -- to track its movement -- to its neck			0
the task is n't an easy one , she said , because the animal can swivel its head around 180 degrees			0
despite another person helping to hold the animal still , he turned and bit her , she said			0
they have " pointy , triangular teeth , " she said			0
it was " very painful			0
" but for the most part , they appeared very " passive , " she said			0
other tarsier species give alarm calls , but these did n't , at least nothing that a human could hear , she said			0
@entity27 said she would like her graduate student , @entity99 , also on the expedition , to return to the field site for her dissertation , to learn more about the number of animals and how altitude and other variables affect them			0
" i do believe that the density of these animals is very low , " she said , noting that many villages are located within @entity13			1
" that threatens them , " she said .			0
