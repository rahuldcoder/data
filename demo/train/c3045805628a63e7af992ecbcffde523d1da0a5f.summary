-- rodents , piles of manure , uncaged birds and flies too numerous to count were found by investigators at @entity8 farms at the heart of the recall of more than half a billion eggs , the @entity1 reported monday			1
inspection reports released by the @entity1 noted numerous violations at six farms operated by @entity15 and @entity16 , which are owned by the same family , and three @entity19 locations			1
the inspections -- conducted in august , after new egg safety rules went into effect -- were launched in response to the nationwide outbreaks of salmonella that have sickened an estimated 1,470 people , according to the @entity1			1
neither company fully adhered to their salmonella enteritidis prevention plans , the inspectors said			0
federal investigators found salmonella bacteria in chicken feed and in barn and walkway areas at some of the farms , officials said last week			0
monday , health officials detailed plans to launch an inspection program of these and other facilities in the coming weeks			0
on a conference call monday , @entity1 officials said they had also found salmonella in water used to wash eggs at a @entity48 facility			1
they said it is not clear whether the eggs were washed in contaminated water or if the water was sullied by the eggs			0
" regarding the positive finding in the egg wash water , it is important to note that after washing , all the eggs are rinsed with water containing chlorine as an additional sanitation step , " said @entity48 spokeswoman @entity52			1
at some @entity15 facilities , federal inspectors found chicken manure in piles up to eight feet high			2
in other spots , mounds of manure prevented doors from closing , allowing rodents and other animals to possibly come inside , @entity1 inspectors said			2
" the uncaged birds were using the manure [ pile ] ... to access the egg - laying area			0
" the report said @entity16 and @entity15 workers did not always wear protective clothing , that birds were in storage and milling facilities , and feed bins had rusted holes and gaps			2
inspectors also found maggots , and in some areas , " live and dead flies were too numerous to count			0
" inspections at three @entity48 farms found -- among other things -- rodents and rodent holes , liquid manure leaking into a chicken house and uncaged chickens tracking manure from a manure pit into a caged henhouse , the inspectors said			1
the @entity99 , a food safety advocacy group , called the @entity1 findings " stomach churning			1
" @entity1 officials have said new egg safety rules , which took effect in mid-july after the outbreak began , will greatly reduce the possibility of a similar salmonella outbreak			1
but the center said the companies did n't properly respond to the rules			0
" both companies involved had been on notice that they needed to meet requirements of the new egg - safety rule for over a year			2
instead of finding companies that were ready to meet those requirements , @entity1 's inspections document companies with long - standing violations and apparently little intention to comply , " the center said in a statement			1
" the decrepit conditions in these henhouses reflect the fact that companies know that @entity1 inspections are so rare -- even following the adoption of a new safety regulation -- that there is no urgency to fix their buildings and their operations to assure compliance with @entity1 statutes and regulations			1
" in a statement , @entity48 said it is committed to addressing all issues raised by the @entity1 in order to be in " full compliance as soon as possible , " so that it can again ship shell eggs			1
" we are in the process of responding to the @entity1 's written report to provide further explanation and clarification of what was observed			2
several of the issues had been identified by the facilities prior to @entity1 's inspection and were already in the process of being addressed during the inspection period			2
additionally , some of the issues were immediately corrected as soon as they were identified			0
" @entity15 said " the vast majority " of the concerns identified in the @entity1 report already have been addressed or are being addressed			1
" we anticipate the expeditious completion of nearly all remaining items by mid-september , " the company said in a statement			0
" to demonstrate our continued commitment to running our farms in the most responsible manner and to ensuring the safety of the eggs we produce , our team has worked around the clock to address concerns that were raised verbally during @entity1 's inspection , with many of those being fixed as soon as they were identified			1
... " members of our farm 's management team actively participated alongside @entity1 officials during daily site inspections , and we have carefully documented details of those inspections			2
" an @entity1 spokeswoman on monday said the inspection reports are " merely inspectional observations and [ do ] not outline any compliance or enforcement actions			1
" she said there would also be inspections at other companies to enforce the regulations			0
" while we can not disclose a list of inspection targets , ... some factors that we will take into consideration in compiling such a list include the size of the farm , the amount of eggs produced , history of violations and connection to previous outbreaks , " said @entity187			2
federal officials pledged monday to inspect all 600 facilities covered under the new egg rule within the next 15 months			0
@entity48 's @entity52 said the company would not respond to specifics in the report			0
" we have put specific action plans in place to address each issue raised and are implementing those action plans , " she said			0
@entity52 also said she does not believe @entity48 is being singled out by federal inspectors			0
@entity0 's @entity212 and @entity213 contributed to this report			0

food safety advocacy group calls findings " stomach churning "
