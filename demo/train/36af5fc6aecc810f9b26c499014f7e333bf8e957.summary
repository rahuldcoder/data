it 's going to make more loans available for small businesses			1
it 's a great victory for @entity20 's entrepreneurs , " @entity2 said to applause at the @entity17 signing ceremony			2
while the bill 's major provisions had backing from both parties , it took months of legislative wrangling to work it out			0
the @entity27 approved it on a 61 - 38 vote last week , with two republicans breaking a @entity32 filibuster to join the 59 democrats in supporting the measure			0
the @entity17 then voted 237 - 187 on mostly partisan lines to send the bill to @entity2 's desk			2
@entity2 noted the political battle in his remarks monday , saying the relief provided by the measure was " needlessly delayed " by @entity32 senators until last week			0
" at this difficult time in our country , it 's essential that we keep up the fight for every job , for every new business , for every opportunity to strengthen this economy , " @entity2 said			2
republicans eager to deny @entity33 any advantage ahead of the november congressional elections have criticized the measure			0
" unfortunately , this bill does nothing to help end the uncertainty that is crippling job creation and hurting small businesses , " @entity17 minority leader @entity56 , @entity57 , said last week			1
" instead it puts taxpayers on the hook for even more bailouts			0
" after the signing ceremony , @entity33 governors and @entity17 members lauded @entity2 for getting the measure passed			0

the @entity93 authorizes the creation of a $ 30 billion fund run by the @entity96 that would deliver ultra-cheap capital to banks with less than $ 10 billion in assets			1
the idea is that community banks do the lion 's share of lending to small businesses , and pumping capital into them will get money in the hands of main - street businesses			1
another provision aims to increase the flow of capital by providing $ 1.5 billion in grants to state lending programs that in turn support loans to small businesses			1
the state programs have proven themselves to be efficient , targeted and effective , but with many states struggling to balance their budgets , the programs are going broke			0
the bill would also provide a slew of tax breaks that will cost $ 12 billion over a decade , according to a preliminary estimate from the @entity121			2
the breaks aim to encourage small businesses to purchase new equipment , to incentivize venture capital firms to invest in small businesses , and to motivate entrepreneurs to start their own business			1
