-- there 's no need to page @entity3 for this case			2
here are the amazing , true stories of four animals that could speak for themselves			2
hoover the seal in 1971 , @entity9 and @entity10 found a baby seal just off the coast of @entity13			1
the little guy appeared to be orphaned , so they took him home and kept him in their bathtub			2
for the first few days , they tried to feed him ground mackerel , but he refused to eat			2
once he trusted his new parents , though , he began eating so voraciously they compared him to a @entity22 vacuum cleaner and the name stuck			2
when he got too big for the tub , @entity22 was moved to a small pond behind the @entity27 ' house			2
after only a few months , @entity22 was eating more fish than his human caretakers were able to provide , so they contacted the @entity30 in @entity31 , hoping the facility had room for him			2
when introducing the seal to the aquarium , @entity9 mentioned that @entity22 could talk			1
of course no one believed him at the time			2
a few years later , though , researchers at the aquarium noticed that @entity22 's guttural sounds really did seem to be forming words and phrases			1
he was often telling people to " get outta here ! " or asking , " how are ya ? " he could say his name and a few other phrases , all with a thick @entity31 accent			1
once the word got out that the @entity30 had a talking seal , he became a media sensation , making appearances in @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , and even on @entity54			1
sadly , @entity22 died of natural causes in july 1985 at the ripe old age of 14			2
he was so admired that he received his own obituary in the @entity58			0
he left behind several offspring , but none possessed his unique gift for gab			1
blackie the cat search @entity64 for " @entity65 " and you 'll find thousands of videos of fluent felines			1
but in 1981 , a talking cat was a bit harder to come by			1
so when @entity72 of @entity73 , @entity74 , trained his cat @entity76 to say , " i love you " and " i want my mama , " they took their act on the road			1
throughout the early 1980s , @entity76 made paid appearances on local tv and radio programs , and even hit the big time with a spot on the network tv show that 's incredible			1
however , as the novelty wore off , @entity72 and @entity76 ended up performing on street corners , asking for donations from passersby			1
after some complaints from locals , police informed @entity72 that he would need to get a business license in order to keep up @entity76 's street show			1
@entity72 paid the $ 50 fee for a license , but something about it rubbed him the wrong way			0
so @entity72 sued the city of @entity73 , under the pretense that the city 's business license code mentions many types of occupations that require a license , but a talking cat show was not one of them			1
but that was n't the only issue @entity72 had -- he also claimed the city was infringing on @entity76 's @entity116			1
@entity72 lost his case , but he appealed the ruling until it came before a federal court			0
the argument was finally closed when three presiding judges declared that the business license ordinance allowed for other , unspecified types of businesses to require a license , which would encompass a talking cat performer			1
as for the @entity116 violation , the courts said the law did not apply because @entity76 was not human , and therefore not protected under the @entity130			1
furthermore , there seemed no good cause for @entity72 to be the one to bring the suit in the first place			0
if @entity76 felt his rights were being violated , as a talking cat , he should have been the one to say something			1
@entity0 : animals that were put on trial 3			0
@entity142 @entity142 , an @entity143 , was purchased from a @entity145 pet store in 1977			1
dr. @entity146 bought the one - year - old bird to see if she could teach a parrot to understand language in a similar manner to chimpanzees and gorillas that had been taught @entity153			1
at the time , it was believed that a large brain , like a primate 's , was necessary to acquire language			1
by comparison , a parrot 's brain is about the size of a walnut , so it was believed that mimicry was the best we could hope for			1
instead , the work of @entity146 and @entity142 ( an acronym for @entity142 ) before his sudden death in 2007 , has changed the perceptions of many in the scientific community			1
according to dr. @entity146 's research , this avian @entity171 could identify 50 different objects , knew seven colors and shapes , and many different kinds of materials like wool , paper , and wood			1
for example , hold up a blue block of wood and @entity142 could tell you the shape , the color , and even what it was made of			1
however , he also grasped more complex concepts that required a higher level of thought and understanding			0
put a handful of red and yellow blocks on a tray and ask him how many were yellow , he could tell you the correct answer			0
if you then asked him how many of those same blocks were green , he would say " none			0
" furthermore , hold up two blocks of different colors and different sizes and he could tell you which was bigger			1
maybe the term " birdbrained " is n't such an insult after all			0
despite the loss of @entity142 , the @entity142 goes on			1
dr. @entity146 's latest feathered pupil is @entity211 , another @entity212 , that was born in 1995			0
in 2007 , @entity214 tested @entity211 against kids at a @entity31 preschool on the basics of object recognition , colors , and shapes			1
it was determined that @entity211 was about as smart as a three - and - a - half year old human			0
not bad for having a brain the size of a walnut			0
@entity0 : 10 technologies we stole from animals 4			0
@entity229 the @entity230 when she was only two days old , @entity229 , a chimpanzee , was purchased by the @entity232 and sent to live with dr. @entity233 , a noted psychologist , who , along with his wife , raised the little chimp as if she were their own human child			1
@entity229 was taught how to eat normal meals at the table using silverware			1
she could dress herself , often choosing to wear skirts just like her " mother " did			0
she could even make tea for her " parents " and the team of researchers who trained and cared for her			0
dr. @entity247 , one of the groundbreaking psychologists who taught @entity153 ( @entity153 ) to @entity249 the chimp in 1967 , helped @entity229 learn to communicate using around 250 asl signs			1
@entity229 could not only give the signs for objects like airplane , ball , and food , but she could also express her emotions with her hands , often " saying " when she was hungry , happy , or sad			1
@entity229 had become so close to human in most every way that she only found human men , not male chimpanzees , sexually attractive			0
it was pretty clear that , in her mind anyway , she was the same as her parents			0
it 's a sad fact that once a captive chimp has reached about four or five years old , their immense strength can become a danger to their human caretakers			2
often they need to be placed in a zoo , a lab , or some other facility better equipped to handle primates			0
in this case , the @entity279 raised @entity229 as their daughter until 1977 , when she was almost 12 years old , before they finally felt like they had to find her a new home			2
after much deliberation , they decided upon a nature preserve in @entity285 on the west coast of @entity287			1
they , along with research assistant @entity288 , flew with @entity229 to her new home to help ease the chimp into the wild			2
however , it was not going to be as simple as they 'd hoped			0
at the preserve , @entity229 was put in a cage at night to protect her from predators			2
she had only ever slept in a bed inside a nice , quiet , suburban home , so the jungle was a completely new and frightening environment for her			0
she was also scared of the other chimps , strange creatures she had only encountered a few times before in her life , preferring to stay close to her parents and @entity288 whenever she could			0
she was n't eating because her food had always been delivered to her on a plate ; she did n't even understand the concept of foraging			0
when her parents suddenly became distant and were n't providing her with the life she had always known , @entity229 became confused and sad			0
she would often use the sign for " hurt			1
" and she lost much of her hair due to the stress of her new situation			0
realizing that @entity229 would never move on if they stayed , her parents left her behind after three weeks			2
@entity288 agreed to stay for a few weeks longer , but it was soon clear that @entity229 could n't change who she was			0
and so , @entity288 never left			2
@entity0 : how do you transport a whale ? @entity288 helped found a chimpanzee sanctuary on an abandoned island in the middle of the @entity323			0
she took @entity229 and other chimps that had been raised in captivity and lived with them on the island , teaching them skills they would need in the wild , like finding food and climbing trees			2
for most , the new lifestyle quickly became second nature			2
but for nearly eight years , @entity229 refused to give up her human ways			0
she wanted human food , human interaction , and to be loved by , what she considered , one of her own kind			0
it was n't until @entity288 stopped living on the island that @entity229 was finally able to accept her new life and joined a troupe of chimps			0
whenever @entity288 visited the island , @entity229 was still affectionate , still used sign language , but thankfully , she always went back with the chimps into the forest			1
sadly , @entity229 's decomposed body was discovered in 1987			0
her exact cause of death is unknown , though some believe she was killed by poachers			0
others say it was probably something less spectacular , like an attack by a dominant male or an illness			0
there 's one thing that no one who knew her wonders about , though , and that 's the fact that @entity229 never really believed she was anything less than human			0
