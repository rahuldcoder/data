in one high school in @entity37 , @entity10 discovered classrooms that only had one or two copies of a text book for a 30 - plus - student class			1
teachers would use chalkboards and cover them with notes from the text book , so everyone could see and digest the information			0
in addition to a lack of books , @entity10 noticed a lack of maps , globes , calculators and other teaching supplies			1
basic transportation to and from school is a problem , too , for some families			0
" oftentimes , kids walk up to two hours to school in rural areas , since their families ca n't afford to pay for public transportation , " said @entity10			1
" this hardship is tough on kids and many times they just give up and quit attending school			0

in @entity26 , resources lack for many children to obtain a basic public education			1

she has made it her life 's mission to help those outside @entity21 borders			2

the school materials are hand - picked by local teachers , and @entity109 takes them shopping about once or twice a year for their supplies			2
how does @entity109 make this happen ? it takes hard work , coordination and personal relationships to make it all come together			2
@entity109 's team is small , consisting of five volunteer directors as well as hundreds of supportive family and friends across the @entity21 and @entity26 who volunteer their time and resources			1

@entity10 said there is n't sufficient access to a wireless network in some of these regions to make it happen now			0
ultimately , @entity10 and her team believe in the power of education and know it 's the key to lift up this region of the world and elsewhere			2
