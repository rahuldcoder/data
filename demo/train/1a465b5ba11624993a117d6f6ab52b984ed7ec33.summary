-- at a critical moment in the newly released action - thriller movie " contagion , " the young disease detective , played by @entity2 , is using a dry - erase board to drive home the danger of the new virus that has wiped out thousands of people , including @entity11			1
@entity2 's character uses a concept known as " @entity14 " -- pronounced " @entity14 " --- to explain to skeptical public health officials that the new virus could be much more contagious than influenza or polio			1
" i wanted people to understand @entity14 , " explains @entity18 , who wrote the film , which was no. 1 at the box office this weekend			1
here it is : @entity14 is the number of new cases that a single infected person will cause , on average			2
in most seasons , @entity14 for influenza is just below 2			0
in the devastating 1918 pandemic , it was likely above 3			0
with an @entity14 that high , the number of cases will grow exponentially , unless patients remain isolated or quickly receive effective treatment			0
" @entity2 did an amazing job with it , " says @entity18			1
" that one scene is really a science and math lesson , but people seem to get it			1
" advanced math and science are n't usually a part of a big @entity47 thriller , particularly one with " contagion 's " cast : not just @entity2 and @entity11 but @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , along with a cameo by @entity0 's dr. @entity54			1
but @entity18 and director @entity56 approached the project in an unusually dedicated way			1
the germ of the idea was planted in @entity18 when he saw an online @entity62 talk by @entity63 , who was one of the doctors and scientists who finally eradicated the smallpox virus in the 1970s			1
by the time he gave the talk in 2006 , he was working with @entity68 to try and leverage the reach of the @entity70 to find early warning signs of a flu pandemic or other outbreak of deadly disease			1
@entity18 reached out to @entity63 , who introduced him to dr. @entity76 , a scientist and disease detective at the @entity78 at @entity79			1
@entity76 describes himself as an experimental pathologist -- " i figure out what went wrong			0
" as a big part of his research , he examines tissue samples from around the world , looking for new and dangerous viruses			1
he began to hold one - on - one seminars with @entity18 at his office and his lab at @entity79 , which evolved into a major role as a consultant on the film			1
@entity76 says the science in " contagion " is strong enough that the film could have a long life as a teaching tool for students , politicians and even public health officials			1
soon , @entity18 found himself poring through the daily reports of @entity102 , a sort of listserv for scientists and infectious disease specialists , flagging unusual cases or findings anywhere in the world			1
" you 'd see three unexplained deaths in @entity112 , or two people with an unusual virus in @entity115			0
i 'd call @entity116 , and frequently he 'd have been sent blood and tissue , to see what it was , " @entity18 recalls			1
for the right killer for " contagion , " " i wanted to find a virus that would be especially nefarious in that it would n't show up in an unusual way , that could be misinterpreted in an emergency room 5,000 miles away from where a person originally caught it			1
" @entity18 and @entity76 eventually focused on a pair of deadly , closely related viruses that primarily live in bats but occasionally infect people : @entity134 , found in @entity135 , and @entity136 , from @entity137			1
with a screenwriter 's glee , they genetically modified the fictional virus to let it spread readily through bodily fluids or coughing			0
voila ! a global killer			0
by then , @entity63 had left @entity68 to work at the @entity146 , a foundation created by @entity148 co-founder @entity147 to conduct research on large - scale dangers , including viruses			1
another @entity147 venture , @entity153 , founded with a mission to support films with important social messages , agreed to underwrite the development of the script			0
@entity159 , @entity153 's president , served as an executive producer of " contagion			1
" meanwhile , @entity76 was opening more doors to the scientific community , including top officials at the @entity165 and the @entity166			0
" some of these places , they would n't have gotten the time of day , " recalls @entity76			2
" but i said , ' look , this is an important film			0
i would n't put my name on it if i did n't think it was going to be solid			2
" @entity166 not only allowed filmmakers to spend a day shooting " on campus , " but senior scientists spent a day with @entity2 to help her prepare for the role			1
@entity2 's main guide at @entity166 was dr. @entity179 , who led the agency 's response to the @entity183 pandemic			1
" in my discussions , the key thing i wanted to get across was the intensity of these investigations , the focus you give and the 24/7 nature of it , " says @entity179			0
" you 're disconnected from your regular life , and totally immersed in what you 're doing			0
" schuchat herself spent six weeks in @entity194 during the @entity196 outbreak in 2003 , barely speaking to her family back home			0
as part of its promotional effort , @entity153 also built a multifaced website , showcasing the work of leading virologists and public health experts			2
one of them is dr. @entity206 , an assistant professor of pediatrics at @entity208 in @entity209 , who has worked with @entity147 to develop an online tool to flag outbreaks as they happen around the world			2
@entity206 called it " a massive challenge " to break down the science of pandemics into a viewer - friendly message			2
" in the absence of a vaccine or a therapeutic ( medication ) , you could n't come up with three things you could do right now to prevent a pandemic			2
" he says that people could somewhat slow the spread of a pandemic by taking simple measures like isolating themselves if they fall sick , or properly washing their hands			0
( @entity18 , incidentally , says he took away one new hand - washing lesson : do n't forget to wash your thumbs			1
) @entity76 says the real message of the film is political : do n't slash budgets for disease research and early - warning systems			2
in 2009 , just a few months into development , it seemed as though real - world developments might hijack the film			0
that 's when @entity18 put the project on hold and watched to see whether his imaginary scenario would be trumped by the real @entity183 virus			1
he found himself fascinated by the push and pull of officials struggling to answer questions from the public			0
he says the pressures are much the same for those officials and for journalists			0
" it 's tricky , " @entity18 said			1
" you do n't want to be the scientist who cried wolf , or the journalist who cried wolf			2
the thing is , they move so quickly , and if you do n't sound the alarm quickly , you 're way behind the curve			2
" in " contagion , " the @entity166 director , played by @entity51 , sends his own family into isolation , even as he offers a more reassuring take to the public			2
he 's outed by an investigative blogger , played by @entity50 , who wins a mass following with his scoops on the pandemic -- some accurate , some deliberately misleading			1
@entity206 says he loved the subplot			0
" that to me is the most interesting part of the film			2
they have this knowledge , and people are holding it back			0
it plays with the idea of false reporting , and the viral nature of the @entity286 and how it can lead to mistrust			2
" @entity179 says the @entity166 is trying to move toward more openness			0
" the more we focus on transparency , the more credibility we have			0
we shared what we knew as we knew it , although we also were careful to say it might change -- this might not be the last word on it			0
" now that his creation is decimating a world filled with some of @entity47 's biggest stars , @entity18 pauses when asked whether the project left him reassured or alarmed about our vulnerability to a newly emergent killer virus			1
" on the one hand , writing it did freak me out			0
i wanted to be realistic , and i kept asking these scientists , ' could this or that scenario really happen ? ' and they always said , ' sure , it could happen			0
' on the other hand , i was reading an article two years ago , and it talked about how human dna is littered with remnants of our battles with retroviruses			0
there 's something poetic about that			0
so with people and viruses , when you look at in the longevity of the relationship , there 's some comfort			0
