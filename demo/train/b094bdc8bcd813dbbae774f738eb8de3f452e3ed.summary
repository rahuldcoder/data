-- a security camera video of a toddler being run over twice on a street in @entity4 has swept across the web in recent days and has drawn a chorus of horrified denunciations			1
how , we wonder , could so many passers - by have so callously ignored the girl 's plight ? as humans , we are horrified when we learn that a person in distress is not helped , even when , as in this case , many potential helpers are present			1
our horror increases if the person is victimized in a particularly vicious or careless way by fellow human beings			2
our horror is further heightened when we learn that the victim is helpless and the kind of person who normally stimulates our instinct to aid and protect			2
our spontaneous reaction is to say : " had i been there , i would have helped ; what is wrong with these people ? " if an incident occurs in a foreign country or culture , it is easy -- maybe tempting , as we grapple with something so baffling -- to conclude that the particular culture is to blame , that it is being callous , uncaring or egotistical			1
it is true that cultural differences exist in many aspects of human behavior , and many of these differences are not trivial			0
but in the @entity4 incident , in which the small child was gravely injured before someone finally carried her away , it would be too facile to think that apathy in the face of others ' suffering is a signature of the local culture			1
first , the public outcry and outrage within @entity4 was quite the same as what one would see in other countries			1
second , there have been , of course , similar cases in other countries			0
indeed , there was the torture and murder of @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68 , in a 1964 street attack			1
early reports , which may not have been entirely accurate , indicated that many people listened to or watched the attack and did nothing to stop it , and so a media blitz followed			2
commentators asked : what is wrong with @entity68 , what is wrong with these times , and what is wrong with the particular neighborhood ? outrage in @entity4 after toddler run over , ignored the incident spawned research on the so - called bystander effect : a set of brilliant experiments conducted by @entity87 and @entity88 © , who showed in their 1968 study that as the number of bystanders goes up , the probability of any individual bystander intervening goes down			1
this is so because each bystander is trying to solve a so - called " volunteer 's dilemma			2
" if everyone responds , the cost could be high and the volunteers might get in each others ' way			2
it would be best if only one bystander responded , the thinking goes			0
if this is so , it is reasonable to ask who it will be and why it should be me			0
since the original experiments , many studies have explored the bystander effect			0
recently , i was part of a research team brought together by @entity117 of the @entity118 , @entity119			0
we surveyed the existing scientific literature and statistically integrated the findings from 105 data sets			0
we found that the bystander effect is quite robust , that it has declined somewhat in magnitude over time , and that there are certain conditions under which it disappears or is even reversed			0
for example , in a situation in which several bystanders need to band together to overwhelm a perpetrator , they will be more likely to act collectively than to act alone			0
the heroic effort of the passengers on @entity136 , which was suspected to be in line to strike a @entity139 target on 9/11/2001 , comes to mind			1
it is these extreme cases , the callous injury of a helpless toddler and the heroic revolt of ordinary people in the face of terrorism , that capture our attention			1
with a bit of luck , most of us will not find ourselves in such existential situations			0
we must ask ourselves , however , how we will respond in more mundane situations that present us with fellow human beings who are in need			0
will we help or hope that someone else will ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			1

@entity160 says video of a toddler run over twice in @entity4 has shocked , horrified many
he says we wonder why it took so long for someone to help and ask are people in @entity4 callous ?
he says what researchers call " volunteers dilemma " not unique to @entity4 ; cites @entity68 case
@entity160 : " @entity176 " sometimes less when a group is needed , as in @entity136
