@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 is looking into a controversial column by an @entity0 @entity6 newspaper publisher that mulled the assassination of an @entity9 president			1
@entity10 , owner and publisher of the @entity12 , wrote a january 13 column about the threat of @entity15 to @entity16			1
he posed three options for the jewish state to counter the @entity15 regime			0
one of them called for a " hit on a president in order to preserve @entity16 's existence			1
" " give the go - ahead for @entity9 based @entity26 agents to take out a president deemed unfriendly to @entity16 in order for the current vice president to take his place and forcefully dictate that the @entity9 ' policy includes its helping the jewish state obliterate its enemies			1
" @entity3 spokesman @entity34 told @entity2 saturday , " we are aware of it			1
we are taking the appropriate investigative steps			1
" @entity10 could not be reached for comment , but the @entity39 , a wire service for @entity6 newspapers in @entity42 , quoted @entity10 on friday as saying " i very much regret it			1
i wish i had n't made reference to it at all			0
" @entity10 -- who said he 's gotten a lot of flak for the column -- said he would issue an apology in the next edition of the weekly newspaper , the @entity39 reported			1
the column , titled " what would you do ? " does n't mention president @entity56 's name , but @entity9 @entity6 groups that strongly denounced the column read the words as a reference to @entity56 himself			1
the column also refers to the administration 's " never ending ' @entity64 ' belief that diplomacy is the answer , " an apparent dig at the @entity56 @entity69 's foreign policy efforts at dialogue with such countries as @entity15			2
" the suggestion by anyone , in this case a @entity6 newspaper publisher , that @entity16 should consider assassinating president @entity56 is shocking beyond belief , " said @entity73 , director of the @entity74 in @entity0			1
" while we acknowledge mr. @entity10 's apology , we are flabbergasted that he could ever say such a thing in the first place			2
how could he even conceive of such a twisted idea ? " said @entity73			0
" mr. @entity10 surely owes immediate apologies to president @entity56 , as well as to the @entity16 and his readership , the @entity0 jewish community			1
" the @entity69 declined to comment saturday on the column			2
@entity90 , the national director of the @entity91 , said @entity10 's " lack of judgment as a publisher , editor and columnist raises serious questions as to whether he 's fit to run a newspaper			0
" " there is absolutely no excuse , no justification , no rationalization for this kind of rhetoric			0
it does n't even belong in fiction			0
these are irresponsible and extremist words			0
it is outrageous and beyond the pale			0
an apology can not possibly repair the damage			0
" irresponsible rhetoric metastasizes into more dangerous rhetoric			0
the ideas expressed in mr. @entity10 's column reflect some of the extremist rhetoric that unfortunately exists -- even in some segments of our community -- that maliciously labels president @entity56 as an ' enemy of the @entity6 people , ' " @entity90 said			1
@entity125 associate dean rabbi @entity124 called the remarks " irresponsible and reprehensible " and said they " must be publicly condemned by @entity6 leaders across the ideological and political spectrum			2
" " we take small comfort from the apology â € ” what a shanda ! " @entity124 said , using the @entity134 word for something shameful or scandalous			0
@entity39 also quoted @entity136 , the @entity16 consul - general in @entity0 as saying he was " appalled at this deranged and morally repugnant assertion			2
we condemn such calls in the strongest possible terms			0
" the @entity12 , a weekly focused on the @entity0 jewish community , was founded in 1925 as the @entity12 .			2

@entity12 piece suggests @entity16 kill @entity9 president " to preserve @entity16 's existence "
@entity9 @entity6 groups slam column ; *writer* reportedly issues apology
" we are taking the appropriate investigative steps , " @entity3 says
