-- the declaration of a state of emergency in @entity3 following violent clashes between anti-government and security forces marks the latest escalation in a long - running political crisis which has plunged the southeast @entity9 country into frequent bouts of disorder and instability			1
the scene from the streets of @entity15 on monday showed widespread protests against the government			0
this weekend 's protests , which included forcing the postponement of a summit of @entity9 leaders in the southern coastal city of @entity23 and demonstrations on the streets of @entity15 , were orchestrated by red - shirted supporters of the controversial and corruption - tainted former prime minister @entity27			1
@entity27 -- a multibillionaire media tycoon elected in 2001 on a populist platform that promised universal healthcare and cash handouts to poor villagers -- was ousted from power in a bloodless army coup in 2006 and has been in exile abroad since being sentenced last october to two years in prison after being convicted of a corruption charge by @entity3 's @entity37			1
but @entity27 remains a polarizing figure in @entity3 , commanding substantial support in the countryside			2
until last year , @entity27 's allies had remained in power with the government headed by the exiled prime minister 's brother - in law , @entity44 , despite disruptive protests by the opposition @entity47 ( @entity47 ) , whose supporters dressed in yellow and represented @entity3 's traditional ruling class , suspicious of @entity27 's populist model of democracy			1
but the @entity47 achieved its goal of ousting @entity44 in december after a week - long occupation of the prime ministerial @entity57 offices and blockading @entity15 's main airports , stranding thousands of tourists			0
@entity3 's @entity60 subsequently disbanded @entity44 's @entity61 for electoral fraud and barred @entity44 from office for five years , paving the way for @entity3 lawmakers to elect opposition leader @entity66 as prime minister			2
ireport.com : " red shirts " take to streets but @entity27 's supporters insist that @entity66 was not democratically elected and have vowed to protest until fresh elections are held			1
on sunday , @entity27 told protesters via a video link from an unknown location that he would return home to lead them in a march on the capital if necessary			2
" now that they have tanks on the street and the soldiers are coming out , so it is time for the people to come out for a revolution , " @entity27 said			1
writing in a blog , @entity0 's @entity15 correspondent @entity86 said he saw five possible scenarios emerging from the current crisis			2
firstly , @entity66 could call a snap election , which he would be unlikely to win because @entity27 's allies continue to lead polls			1
secondly , he could resign , resulting in the creation of another coalition which would struggle to unify the rival factions , leaving open the likelihood of further protests from one side or the other			0
thirdly , @entity27 could return from exile to lead a red - shirted uprising ; a scenario which @entity86 describes as " messy and bloody			0
" ireport.com : " numerous buses set ablaze " fourthly , the army could again intervene , as it has done in the past , although @entity86 says that would do little to heal the deep divisions between both sides			0
finally , @entity86 said , @entity66 could choose to ride out the protests or " get tough			0
" but both strategies would likely damage his standing			0
" trying to ignore the protests will leave him looking even weaker ; ordering a violent crack - down may simply harden the resolve of the red shirts and provide fodder to their questionable claims that @entity66 has dictatorial tendencies , " @entity111 said .			0
