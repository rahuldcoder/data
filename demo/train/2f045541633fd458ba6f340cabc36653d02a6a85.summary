@entity0 -- the helicopter crash in @entity0 that killed interior minister @entity5 and all seven other people aboard shows no evidence of an explosion , a @entity3 official said saturday			1
" in visual and preliminary investigations of the crash site , the remains of the aircraft do not show evidence of any kind of damage from an explosion or fire , " said @entity9 , minister of communication and transportation			1
" it is worth mentioning that according to the available information up until this moment , present at the place and time of the incident were layers of clouds and reduced visibility , " @entity9 said			1
his announcement on government television came as @entity0 began a day of grieving for the eight killed friday in the helicopter crash in a rural area just south of @entity0			1
@entity3 president @entity31 and his wife were among the government officials at a public funeral in @entity0 on saturday afternoon			1
the eight caskets were each draped with the @entity3 flag on the vast green grounds of @entity38 where @entity31 led a tearful ceremony of handing portraits of the eight helicopter victims to their respective families and children			1
a military band played sorrowful dirges , as did a drum and bugle corps at other points in the funeral			2
" here , in the earth , their example and memory will endure forever , " @entity31 told the black - attired mourners in the galleries and grandstand , all on their feet during the ceremony			0
" these are difficult times for the government and for the nation , but it is also a time to show the strength to overcome these adversities , " @entity31 said			1
the friday incident -- which occurred 2.5 miles south of the town of @entity66 in the municipality of @entity68 -- evoked comparisons to a 2008 plane crash that also killed the country 's then - interior minister			1
that crash , in a luxurious @entity0 neighborhood , was later determined to be an accident caused by turbulence			2
the @entity78 carrying the minister and others was following a commercial airliner too closely , authorities said			2
@entity31 on friday called @entity5 " a great @entity3 who deeply loved his country and served until the last moment of his life			1
" analysts said that the crash puts renewed attention on the president 's controversial efforts to fight the nation 's notorious cartels because the interior minister oversees domestic security			1
" the national mood is such that even before this , people are alarmed " about cartel violence , said @entity96 , professor at the @entity97 who 's an expert on @entity3 law and @entity100 - @entity0 relations			1
" @entity31 is in the last year of his presidency , so @entity0 is entering a presidential election year just as the @entity100 is			0
president @entity31 has been criticized because the number of persons killed has escalated during his presidency and so people see him as failed			0
i think that 's a harsh judgment , " @entity96 said			0
" he inherited a country , especially in the northern states , that is being destabilized by the drug cartels			0
he 's started employing the army , which has n't been used much domestically , to fight the drug cartels , " @entity96 said			0
while @entity5 was well regarded by @entity100 officials , his loss wo n't devastate the @entity31 administration , said @entity119 , associate professor of international relations at the @entity121			1
" i think there 's an inevitability that there will be speculation that organized crime was involved in this , but it seems highly unlikely to me that indeed will be the case , " @entity119 said , noting how the helicopter crashed under foggy conditions in a remote area			0
" he was very highly thought of both within @entity0 and with his counterparts in the @entity100 , " @entity119 said of @entity5			2
" with that said , he has not been one of the central figures in the battle against drug cartels in @entity0			0
the lead has been taken more by the federal police and the president himself , along with the military and the prosecutor 's office			0
" the helicopter went down in the @entity149 area south of @entity0 , government spokeswoman @entity146 said			0
two other government officials were killed in the crash : undersecretary for @entity154 and human rights @entity155 and the ministry 's press office chief , @entity157 , she said			0
in july 2010 , @entity31 appointed @entity5 to the post that oversees security efforts against drug cartels in @entity0			2
that battle has cost thousands of lives			0
" i grieve his loss " and those of the other victims , @entity31 said in a national address on friday , adding that @entity5 , who was 45 , leaves behind a wife and two children			2
authorities will continue to investigate the cause of the accident			0
a photograph of the crash site depicts a relatively concentrated debris field			0
the @entity179 - manufactured @entity178 helicopter was made in 1987 and had logged 717 hours of flight , @entity3 officials said			2

the others killed were @entity187 , the technical secretary of the minister 's office ; maj. @entity190 of the @entity191 , who was @entity5 's personal security detail ; and three members of the air force : pilot lt. col. @entity195 , lt. @entity196 and sgt. @entity197			1
before becoming interior minister , @entity5 was an attorney from @entity200 state who was chief of staff to the state government from 2007 until july 2010			1
previously , he was a councilman in @entity203 , as well as a state and federal congressman			0
@entity5 was considered to be politically close to the president and , in fact , led his political campaign in @entity200			1
ironically , @entity5 's last writing in his @entity211 account refers to the november 2008 accident that killed a prior interior minister			1
" today we remember @entity218 three years after his departure , a human being who worked on building a better @entity0 , " @entity5 wrote in a tweet posted november 4 , the third anniversary of the accident			2
