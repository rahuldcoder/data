-- we are pretty new to the youth sports world — my son is five — and i 've already seen crazy parents and coaches and kids who are being pushed against their will			1
i just pray that my kid continues to have awesome coaches who understand what it 's all about and how to keep things in age - appropriate perspective			1
@entity15 has his first soccer game on saturday and his coach ( who he 's had for the past two seasons ) wrote this in his first email : " my coaching philosophy is simple			1
we will win every game			0
losing is not an option			0
losing sucks ! so start the kids on a raw steak diet and i will see all of you monday at 5:15 for our first practice			0
" he was obviously poking fun at the youth sports culture we live in where kids start playing younger and get ultra competitive way too soon			2
and i honestly ca n't wait for the game this weekend			0
it 's so great to see my kid having so much fun and playing well and getting such joy and confidence from his team and his coach			1
the thing is , a good coach can be the most amazing mentor to young kids , someone whose words they 'll remember forever			1
but a bad coach — even one bad coach — can be beyond damaging and completely ruin a sport for a young person , and shake their confidence in irreparable ways			1
by now you 've probably heard about the @entity59 men 's basketball coach and how he was fired today after videos surfaced of him physically and verbally abusing his team over the past three years			1
i 've watched the video a few times — it 's the second most disturbing basketball video i 've seen this week ( the first would be @entity65 's horrific leg break )			1
parenting.com : are kids ' sports too competitive ? the coach , @entity69 , is seen kicking players , throwing balls at them ( even at their heads ! ) , pushing them and screaming terrible gay slurs			1
it 's insane and hard to watch			2
the dude seems like a total nutcase who should seek help immediately and i ca n't believe the athletic director did n't do more when he first learned of this behavior last year ( actually , of course i can believe it as we all know how effed up these big programs can be — hello , @entity86 )			0
and i ca n't even imagine what else those poor boys endured			0
that 's the thing that gets me most now that i 'm a mom : these are boys			2
some of them fresh out of high school , their first time on their own and this is the kind of person they have looking out for them ? shaping them as men who will grow up to — guess what ? — probably not play basketball			0
( the @entity101 is the first to acknowledge the statistical unlikelihood of their players going pro. ) parenting.com : competitive sports ... for toddlers ? and i can only imagine what their parents must think seeing this video now			1
they probably invited this man into their homes for recruiting visits and trusted him with their impressionable boys , trusted him to mold them and inspire them and look out for them			0
now do n't get me wrong , i know that coaching on this level is not about blowing sunshine up your team 's butt			1
@entity59 is a big - time @entity127 program and this man 's job is to get as many wins as possible			1
coaches yell , they get frustrated , they may even freak out occasionally			2
i think athletes know this and certainly college athletes have been around long enough to understand that every coach has a different style and some are yellers			2
but -- and i ca n't believe this needs to be said -- throwing balls at a kid 's head and calling him a " fairy " and worse is just plain unacceptable			1
i played @entity143 and i can tell you it was n't all clapping and positive reinforcement			2
in all honesty , we had an emotionally abusive coach who was ultimately fired , but that 's another story for another time			1
the point is , i get that it 's tough , i get that it 's not black and white			2
parenting.com : 1 in 50 : real faces of autism but i also get that there should be a line			0
and perhaps when you find yourself heaving a basketball at a kid 's head , that line has been crossed			2
i have long been dubious of big - time college sports and what it does to the self - esteem and psyches of young people			1
and what , in the end , is the payoff for such a huge sacrifice ( when you play @entity176 sports in a big program , it is pretty much all you do ) ? my experience — which was pretty awful and lasted only one year and is still something i rarely talk about — has influenced my feelings on this a lot			2
that 's not to say i do n't want my kids playing or that i do n't believe in sports			1
before college i was a die - hard athlete and loved every second of the sports culture			2
and i had some great coaches			0
i also had some so - so ones			0
and i saw plenty of the politicking that goes on , which is another icky reality we as parents need to be aware of			0
i love sports and i know how good they are for our kids			0
i wrote a story for @entity200 's april issue -- " @entity201 " -- that discusses all of this and more			1
we are in a brave new world and anyone whose kids play or will play should read it			0
yes , youth sports are fantastic for our kids			0
but there are risks and other factors to consider			0
including who are the people we trust to coach our children			0
are they trained ? are they positive ? are they too focused on winning ? do they know what to do in case of injury ? are they ... abusive ? i 'm fascinated and frightened by all of it and i just hope i can maintain my convictions to never take any of it too seriously as my kids get older			0
a bad coach can change a person			0
and as a mother to kids who will likely be playing plenty of sports , stories like this @entity59 debacle stay with me and make me think			1
parenting.com : finding the best sports team for your child sure this is the college level which , when it comes to basketball , may as well be pro. but we hand over our kids — our little kids — to coaches all the time			1
who knows what 's going on at practice when we 're not there ? if your kid is anything like mine he 's probably not giving you the blow - by - blow you want			0
so maybe it 's not be a bad idea to ask the coach what his or her philosophy is before leaving the field next time			1
would love to know what you guys think of this story			0
how did you react ? what would you do if it was your son getting pegged in the head ? are you dubious of youth sports and the competitive nature ? get 2 @entity273 now ! ! copyright 2011 @entity274			1

do you know the coaching philosophy of your child 's sports coach ?
coaches have *profound* influence -- positive or negative -- on a child 's psyche
even though the *writer* 's son is young , the @entity59 coaching video gives her pause
