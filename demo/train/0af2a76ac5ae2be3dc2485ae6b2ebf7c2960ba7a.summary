-- @entity2 's prime minister tried to reassure the world about the safety of the upcoming @entity5 on tuesday as security forces worked to clamp down on potential threats far from the @entity9 resort where the games will soon begin			1
a suspected militant leader died in a shootout with police in the restive @entity14 of @entity15 , hundreds of miles east of the @entity5 venues in @entity18 , the state news agency @entity20 reported			2
the news agency said @entity2 special forces were engaged in other operations in the same territory			1
and in @entity18 and in @entity26 , a nine - hour drive to the north , police handed out posters of women they suspect may be planning terrorist attacks			1
in an interview set to air wednesday on @entity0 's @entity36 program , prime minister @entity32 said " there are always some threats " to public events , " not only this country but also in others			0
" but @entity2 authorities are aware of those threats and are planning accordingly , he said			1
" i am referring to the mobilization , build - up , of police forces , and a huge number of policemen will watch the progress of the @entity5 , " @entity32 said			0
@entity2 has been battling a low - level @entity51 insurgency in @entity15 and the @entity52 for more than a decade , and militants have vowed to strike at the @entity5			1
over the weekend , as president @entity57 told reporters his government has a " perfect understanding " of the threat and how to stop it , a video posted online warned that the insurgents had " a present " for @entity5 visitors			1
@entity65 may share @entity67 tech with @entity2 @entity68 , the head of the @entity2 and @entity70 program at the @entity72 - based @entity71 , said @entity57 made a " brazen bet " by bidding for the @entity5 in @entity18			1
" he sees one of the historic roles he has played as being to stabilize the @entity52			0
unfortunately , the @entity52 are n't as stabilized as he would like , and by holding the @entity76 in such close proximity to , in effect , a conflict zone , he 's taking a big risk			1
if things do n't go well all of his claims about the stability he has brought to the @entity52 -- and in a way , more broadly , to @entity2 -- are going to be diminished			1
" @entity68 said it would be " very , very difficult " for militants to pull off large - scale attacks in @entity18 , but he said they do n't have to hit @entity18 itself to hurt the @entity5			0
a series of attacks like the @entity98 bombings in the surrounding area " would raise the terror level in the country and in the international community to such a level that the @entity5 themselves would be imperiled , " he said			2
amid the concerns , the top @entity65 military officer discussed sharing high - tech equipment to counter improvised bombs with his @entity2 counterpart tuesday , a @entity101 spokesman told @entity0			1
the matter came up " on an exploratory level " in a meeting between gen. @entity108 , the chairman of the @entity113 , and @entity2 gen. @entity114 , @entity108 spokesman col. @entity107 said			1
the @entity65 developed portable and vehicle - mounted jamming systems after radio - controlled roadside bombs took a huge toll on @entity65 troops in @entity120 and @entity121			2
a @entity65 official with knowledge of the discussions said military staff from both countries will now look at whether the @entity65 technology is compatible with @entity2 systems			1
fears of ' black widows ' as @entity5 near in @entity18 , police have handed out fliers at hotels warning of a woman they believe could already be in the city and planning a terrorist attack			1
one flier , dated january 15 , asks workers to be on the lookout for @entity141 , described as the widow of a member of a militant group from the @entity52			2
@entity141 may be involved in organizing " a terrorist act within the 2014 @entity5 region , " the flier warns			0
authorities received information about @entity141 's possible arrival in the region last week , it states			2
@entity0 obtained the notice from security staff at a hotel in @entity18			0
photos of @entity141 have flooded television and social media reports from @entity18 , and some describe her as a " black widow " -- a group of women who have carried out high - profile suicide bombings after their insurgent husbands were killed by government forces			2
security experts stressed monday that @entity141 was probably one of many suspects that authorities are trying to find			2
but former @entity171 agent @entity170 said protecting the @entity5 will require " multiple layers " of security			0
" if somebody 's already on the inside -- if she 's already , let 's say , has a job at a particular event or has special access , then she 's already bypassed one of those layers of security , " @entity170 said			0
" hopefully , now that this warning has taken place , they 'll find her , if in fact she 's in the region			0
" another flier handed out by security forces to hotels in @entity26 , in southwestern @entity2 , names three women it says could carry out a suicide attack planned by militant groups between january 21 and 24 , during the @entity196			1
one of the three , @entity197 , was killed in a gun battle over the weekend in @entity15 in which seven militants reportedly died			0
she had been trained to be a suicide bomber , @entity20 cited terrorism officials as saying			0
the other two are named as @entity204 and @entity205			0
pictures on the flier show two of the three women in @entity211 head coverings , but the text warns that the women may not be dressed that way			0
" suspected terrorists may use regular clothing without any @entity211 elements , e.g. no long dresses , no hijab , which makes it easier to blend into a crowd , and makes it easier to get access to large gatherings without being noticed , " it says			0
@entity0 's @entity230 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 contributed to this report .			0
