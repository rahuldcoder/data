months after a secret e-mail search controversy at @entity2 , @entity0 announced on tuesday that she will step down as dean on july 1 , according to a statement posted online			1
@entity0 came under fire in march for conducting a search of the e-mail accounts of resident deans in an effort to find who leaked information regarding a cheating scandal involving more than 100 students			1
the @entity14 , the daily newspaper of @entity2 , published an article in april titled , " to rebuild trust , @entity16			2
" the article concluded by stating " with @entity0 's resignation , @entity2 can begin to bridge the rift of trust between the administration and the community it serves			1
" @entity0 said in a statement that the e-mail controversy was " not a motivating factor " in her decision to step down as dean			1
" i was never asked to step down , " she said			0
" i have been in discussions to return to academia and my research for some time			0
" @entity32 will take a sabbatical after 11 years of continuous service before returning to her teaching program and her scholarship , the statement says			0
" being dean of @entity2 has been an immensely rewarding experience for me , " said @entity38 in the statement , " but i miss engaging deeply with my scholarship and teaching			2
" " i 'm grateful to [ @entity0 ] for all she has done to help our undergraduates thrive , " said president @entity43 , " and we will be fortunate to continue benefiting from her talents and wisdom			2
" @entity2 students forced to withdraw amid cheating scandal in 2008 , @entity0 became the first @entity53 and the first woman to be named dean of @entity2			1
after the scandal in march , the school apologized for the way it handled the secret search			1
" while the specific document made public may be deemed by some as not particularly consequential , the disclosure of the document and nearly word - for - word disclosure of a confidential board conversation led to concerns that other information -- especially student information we have a duty to protect as private -- was at risk , " said a statement from @entity0 and @entity61 , dean of the @entity62			1
" consequently , with the approval of the dean of @entity62 ( @entity62 ) and the university general counsel , and the support of the dean of @entity2 , a very narrow , careful , and precise subject - line search was conducted by the @entity79 's it department , " they added			1
@entity61 and @entity0 stressed that the search was limited to administrative accounts and that it did not involve a review of e-mail content			2
" to be clear : no one 's e-mails were opened and the contents of no one 's e-mails were searched by human or machine , " they said			0
the search successfully identified a resident dean who had forwarded a confidential e-mail			0
however , after review , school officials determined the dean in question had committed " an inadvertent error and not an intentional breach " by sending the message to two students			0
" operating without any clear precedent for the conflicting privacy concerns and knowing that no human had looked at any e-mails during or after the investigation , we made a decision that protected the privacy of the resident dean who had made an inadvertent error and allowed the student cases being handled by this resident dean to move forward expeditiously , " @entity61 and @entity0 said			1
" we understand that others may see the situation differently , and we apologize if any resident deans feel our communication at the conclusion of the investigation was insufficient , " they added			0
news of the secret search drew immediate criticism from some members of @entity2 's faculty			1
@entity127 , a professor and former dean of @entity2 , said on his blog that he will likely move most of his personal e-mails to another account , keeping his @entity2 address just for business			1
he described the way the school handled the case as dishonorable			0
" why not tell people you are reading their e-mail ? would it not be the honorable thing to do ? what is to be gained by not doing that ? other than avoiding , perhaps , the embarrassment of acknowledging that you are doing something to which the targets would reasonably object if they knew it , " he wrote			0
a month prior , the school had announced that more than half the students implicated in the cheating scandal had been required to withdraw for a time			2
more than 100 students were investigated for plagiarism or for having " inappropriately collaborated " on a course 's take - home , open - book spring final exam			0
the class was @entity158 1310 : introduction to @entity159 , according to the @entity14			0
many of those who were not forced to withdraw faced disciplinary probation at the @entity164 institution in @entity165 , @entity166 , and the remaining were cleared			0
