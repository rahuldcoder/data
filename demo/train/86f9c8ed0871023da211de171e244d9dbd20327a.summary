-- at first glance , @entity1 does n't exactly look like a man of international sporting history			1
tall , slim and stylishly dressed , the 56 - year - old appears to have more in common with a graphic designer or university professor than a globally renowned footballer			2
but make no mistake -- this is a man who has represented the @entity11 at a @entity12 and a @entity13 before breaking through football 's @entity14 to become the first player from the @entity11 to play for an @entity18 club			1
@entity1 , who hails from @entity19 ( then part of the @entity11 and currently a country in political and social turmoil ) , was a cultured , yet physically tough defender and sweeper who made 300 appearances for @entity25 and earned 49 caps for the @entity11			1
he eventually brought his steely @entity11 style to @entity18 league side @entity28 , blazing a trail for the likes of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 in the process			1
" it was interesting because it was 1988 and at that time it started to be the history of @entity42 , " of glasnost and perestroika , @entity1 said of the circumstances that surrounded his signing for @entity38 in 1988			1
there was interest from " some @entity48 clubs , some from @entity51 ( but ) first time when i heard about @entity28 i would n't choose any other team because for me @entity18 football is everything			1
" " i left everything that we have over there ( in the @entity11 )			1
when we got all the papers , passports , we flew and we started for two years to live here			2
" pitching up near the @entity61 coast was a far cry from the regimented footballing education @entity1 received back home , however			1
strategy and attitudes to sport were far more sophisticated in his homeland than in @entity18 where a hard - drinking culture was still prevalent amongst players at many leading football clubs			1
early days @entity1 had learned at the feet of @entity74 after all , a @entity25 hero and one of the most vaunted footballing coaches of the 20th century			1
@entity74 was famed for his scientific focus on conditioning and no little tactical nous			1
he was also one of the first coaches to harness the power of computer technology to track performance levels and simulate game scenarios			2
athletic and intelligent , the young @entity1 had the raw materials to succeed in the rigorous @entity74 program			1
he was spotted by the @entity25 boss while still a teenager at the @entity92 academy of footballing excellence which he had left home to attend at the age of 13			2
by 1976 an offer to turn professional was on the table from @entity99			2
@entity25 had won the @entity100 one year previously , becoming the first club side from the @entity11 to lift a major continental trophy			1
the decision to accept was not a difficult one			2
" i joined @entity25 and it was huge club , huge competition , and you play each game in front of 100,000 people			2
it 's something special , " @entity1 said of his time in the @entity19 capital			1
" @entity99 was one of the best in @entity117 from the content of coaching , from facilities , its a premier ground , the analysis , the background of teams			2
" " even when i came ( to @entity18 ) after i played for @entity25 twelve years ( later ) , the clubs did not do that kind of work that we had at @entity99			1
" this meticulous approach was something that would filter its way into the @entity11 national team after @entity133 took charge for two spells during the 1980s			1
" @entity25 was the best side in @entity137 at the time			2
( we had ) maybe 12 , 14 or 15 or sometimes even 17 people who represented national team , " @entity1 said			1
" but ( we would ) still be very friendly with other players from other clubs			0
we had unity which i think maybe was a strength of ours			0
( we were ) like brothers and it really helped us			0
" international stage this promising group of players would go on to star at the @entity151 in @entity152 , the 1982 @entity12 in @entity153 and the @entity13 in @entity154 six years later			0
the @entity11 would reach the final of @entity156 where they would lose to a @entity157 inspired @entity158			1
for football geeks , the game played at @entity162 's @entity161 represented a heavyweight clash of footballing philosophies -- the scientific approach of @entity74 against the " total football " ideals of @entity168 manager @entity167			1
@entity74 's @entity11 side had beaten @entity158 1 - 0 in the group stages earlier in the tournament , but @entity167 would get his revenge in the final thanks to a goal from @entity176 and a wonder volley from @entity157			1
@entity1 was injured for much of the tournament , however , and only managed to make an appearance in the final as a substitute after his side had gone 2 - 0 down			1
it is for this reason he holds fonder memories of the 1982 @entity12 in @entity153			0
although the @entity11 were knocked out in the second stage , @entity1 was a key player at the heart of the @entity11 defense			1
" ( the ) @entity12 in @entity153 was like dream come true for me , " @entity1 said			1
" i could not wait			0
i remember each game , like i could not sleep before game because you want to step up on football pitch			0
" " you 're going to bed like maybe ten o'clock in evening and you 're thinking about game			0
you 're thinking about what can be happening			0
you 're thinking and you 're so excited you look at clock and it 's ( already ) three o'clock morning , " he laughingly adds			0
despite the @entity11 's early exit , @entity199 regards the ' 82 @entity12 as one of his proudest moments			1
he even scored a rare goal in the group stages against @entity206			0
" a lot of players will play in @entity12 as forwards who never score and i was ( a ) center defender and i scored this goal			2
it 's like a dream you know			0
this is the most memorable memory of all , it was fantastic			0
" other favored memories of this tournament include playing against @entity219 legends of the game such as @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223			0
" i will never forget ( that ) game against @entity225 when we played in against @entity222 and @entity223			0
the two of them ( scored ) in the last ten minutes and we lost 2 - 1 , " he said			0
foreign travels @entity1 began his @entity230 sojourn following his final international appearance in 1988			1
after two seasons at @entity28 , he headed north of the border to @entity234 , spending three years at @entity235 before going on to manage @entity236			0
today , @entity1 spends his time coaching promising youngsters at @entity240 side @entity239			2
pitching up at such comparative footballing outposts was a far cry from his days at the pinnacle of @entity245 football but his family had settled in the @entity230			0
" after ten years you realize kids grow up ... you realize you have your house here , your home here , your land here ... you are more than 15 years here and its how it happened ? " his son , @entity254 , was a promising footballer before injury curtailed his career			2
daughter @entity257 , meanwhile , became a professional tennis player , reaching the number no. 1 ranking in @entity230 and breaking into the world 's top 50			0
but tragedy struck earlier this year when she was diagnosed with liver cancer			0
like her father , however , aggression in the face of adversity is a trait the now 30 - year - old @entity257 has in spades			0
" she was fighter during her days in sport and she is a fighter now , " he said			0
" i would like to say thanks to everyone who is support ( ing ) us , sending message , emails , calling us to give us support or offer any advice or you know			0
" " most importantly we are all together , fighting all together			0
" sage words from a man who made a sporting career out of just such a philosophy			0
