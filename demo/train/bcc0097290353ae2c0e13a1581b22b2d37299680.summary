@entity0 was n't the type to wait for the storm to pass			1
she preferred to dance in the downpour			0
" when a big rain would come , she 'd always get out and dance in the rain , " the teen 's mother , @entity4 , said			1
" she taught me how to dance in the rain			0
" @entity4 was used to her daughter 's eccentricities			1
this was a teen who once painted herself green " for sport " and " set booby traps , " sticking wads of gum on the bathroom door handle as a child , her mother said			2
" if the world was n't entertaining enough , she would entertain herself with the world			0
she used to do all sorts of crazy stuff for sport , " her mother fondly recalled			2
it was when that playful nature waned that @entity4 suspected something was wrong			0
@entity0 's teachers saw it , too , as her grades suffered and her gregarious personality dimmed			1
" she just did n't laugh as much , you know ? and she had the most beautiful laugh , " @entity4 said			0
one of @entity0 's peers at a church counseling group broke the news to @entity4 in 2008 : @entity0 , then 14 , had been raped by @entity38 , a business teacher at @entity39			1
he was 35 years older than @entity0			2
@entity4 set aside her disappointment that @entity0 had n't confided in her and called the police			2
as news of the sexual assault disseminated through their hometown of @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity0 was ostracized and bullied			1
as @entity38 's case traversed the court system -- during which the teacher confessed to repeatedly raping the girl in his home , car and office in 2007 -- @entity4 came home one day to find @entity0 in @entity4 's bed , dead from a self - inflicted gunshot wound			1
it was february 6 , 2010 -- 2Â½ weeks shy of @entity0 's 17th birthday			1
this week , hundreds of protesters converged on a park adjacent to @entity63 , armed with a petition thousands of signatures strong , demanding that the judge who handed @entity38 a 30 - day jail sentence after @entity0 's suicide step down			1
he would recant and apologize later , but judge g. @entity70 defended the sentence at the time by saying that @entity0 looked older than her age and that the 14 - year - old was as much in control of the situation as @entity38			1
@entity0 was tough , determined and certainly strong - willed , her mother said			1
her raw honesty often offended people , and she rarely shied away from telling someone how she felt			0
but how could she be in control ? especially being two years younger than @entity48 's age of consent ? her mother wonders			1
@entity4 has done numerous interviews in her quest to unseat @entity70 from the bench he 's held since 1984 and prompt a judicial review of the case			2
on friday , she took a break from rehashing the rape , suicide and sentencing to look back on her daughter -- not the victim , but the older sister to @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 who believed in unicorns and loved strawberry cheesecake , camping and making sandwiches			1
" she could probably out - cook @entity101 -- vegetables on everything , " her mother said			2
in many ways @entity0 was a typical kid			2
her mother called her " @entity106 , " a play on " daughter , " while everyone else called her @entity110 , the name her aunt gave her the day she was born			1
she enjoyed walking the family 's pit bulls , @entity115 and @entity116 , one named for a character in " @entity118 , " the other named for fun			0
a 15 - year - old @entity0 banged up a car and the backyard fence trying to take the canines for a ride , @entity4 said			1
@entity124 and daughter were always introducing each other to new things			0
@entity0 gave her mom the " @entity130 " vampire series , and @entity4 reciprocated by acquainting @entity0 with @entity132 's " @entity131			1
" @entity4 's fondness for the supernatural went only so far , though			0
@entity0 would have to go elsewhere to watch her scary movies			2
" i do n't do horror flicks , " @entity4 said			0
the two shared plenty of other interests , though -- namely music			0
@entity4 enjoyed listening to @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity0 's favorite band , @entity143 , while her daughter grew to love @entity145 and @entity146			1
" we 'd be down in the living room -- crank it up , open the windows , open the doors and she danced , " @entity4 said , recalling how she and @entity0 listened to their favorite tunes			2
" she was a pretty good headbanger , and she had the hair for it			0
" @entity0 also loved the outdoors			1
she 'd climb " the @entity158 , " the scenic sandstone bluffs overlooking @entity47 from where @entity4 , as a kid , would try to throw rocks at airplanes leaving the nearby airport			0
when the family went to @entity166 or @entity167 -- two of @entity0 's favorite camping spots -- she 'd refuse to take shelter in the motor home			1
she and her close friend , @entity173 , would stay outside in @entity0 's battered tent , which leaked			1
the pair got soaked several times , @entity4 said			0
in school , @entity0 often excelled			2
her teachers described her as gifted -- both academically and artistically -- and an energetic hard worker			0
she was insatiably curious , and if she did n't know the answer to something , " she was the type who was going to look it up , " her mother said			0
yet despite her intelligence , her grades would occasionally flag , not because she could n't grasp the subject matter but because it did n't interest her , her mother said			0
the arts , thankfully , always intrigued her , whether it manifested itself in dance or her abstract doodles			0
she also enjoyed poetry , and @entity4 described her daughter 's style as " darker , " reminiscent of @entity196			1
but that was n't always the case			0
@entity4 recalls @entity0 's last gift to her			2
her daughter asked what she wanted for @entity202 , and @entity4 replied that she 'd like a poem			0
@entity0 scribed an ode to her and her mother 's relationship			1
asked to describe the sonnet , @entity4 hesitated before finding the words			0
but in the end , we love , no matter what -- that sort of thing			0
