it moves millions of people around the @entity3 capital every day , acted as a giant air raid shelter during @entity5 and in more recent times sections of it have been transformed to host hydroponic farms			2
now the @entity9 is being touted as a stylish new subterranean route for pedestrians and cyclists			1
@entity13 -- which won the award for best conceptual project at the @entity16 last week -- proposes transforming disused tube tunnels into a network of underground pathways that will reduce the pressure on the city 's bustling streets			1
the plans also highlight the possibility of offering excess space up for cultural and retail projects			0
" our concept proposes repurposing underutilized infrastructure to provide quick links between existing tube stations and key @entity38 landmarks and destinations , " said @entity27 , managing director of @entity28 , the architecture and design firm behind the idea			1

" anything is possible , " @entity27 continued			0
" our vision for the @entity13 relies on infrastructure that 's already in place			0
we 'd like to bring it back to life			0
" in their submission to the @entity16 competition , @entity58 highlighted the green credentials of the project as well as its transportation benefits			1
@entity67 technology which transforms footsteps into kinetic energy would help power electricity and @entity72 networks in the tunnels , the company said			2
on top of all this , underline could provide the added benefit of helping to reduce accidents involving cyclists on the road			0
there were 489 cycle incidents classed as fatal and serious in @entity38 's in 2013 , according to data from @entity84 , the city 's transport authority			1
however , some critics and cycle groups have branded the project as gimmicky and not a plan that would make cycling more convenient			0
" this is something that rears its head every so often , ideas to put cycle pathways underground or in the sky , " said @entity92 of the @entity93			1
architect @entity100 unveiled designs for @entity102 , a network of elevated bike paths hoisted aloft above railway lines , in early 2014 although little has been heard of the idea since			0
a spokesperson for @entity84 also told @entity0 that even though there are a number of disused stations and tunnels beneath the streets of @entity38 there were none of " significant length that are not already part of our operational railway			1
" @entity119 said she would rather see " @entity126 style " infrastructure put in place on existing road networks to separate cyclists and heavy traffic			0
and @entity84 recently granted permission for two new sections of " cycle superhighways " which reserve long stretches of @entity38 road for cyclists only			1
" the greatest way to encourage cycling is to make it easier for people to plan local trips to the shops or to schools , " @entity119 said			1
" obviously if you are proposing underground tunnels , that 's just not going to work , " as many bike journeys wo n't go anywhere near the subway network , she added			1
yet @entity27 counters that the the @entity58 idea is designed to augment existing cycle infrastructure rather than compete with it			2
even if the @entity13 idea does n't take off , he thinks it could be applied to other cities with large underground networks			2
" commentators from all over the world are reaching out for more information about our proposal , to evaluate it against their own disused infrastructure , " @entity27 said			0
" what we are saying with the @entity13 is that we need to look at all the spaces that currently exist within cities , and ask ourselves : ' are we using them in the best way that we can ? ' if not , what else could we do ? "			0

disused @entity38 underground tunnels proposed as pathways for cyclists and pedestrians
the concept was awarded first prize at the @entity16 last week
cycle and transport counter idea may not be best *option* to encourage more people to cycle
