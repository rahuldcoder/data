@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 state investigation has determined that 31 crosses on the grounds of a former reform school mark graves of teens and employees who died in a fire and an influenza outbreak			1
crosses mark graves of reform school students killed in a fire and flu outbreak in the early 1900s , investigators say			1
one grave even contains the body of a student who was slain by another student , the investigation found			1
the five - month investigation by the @entity25 rules out claims by a group of reform school survivors that students who were beaten by guards are buried there			1
the former students , now in their 60s , call themselves the " white house boys , " after a concrete - block building where boys were taken for punishment			1
they said that they witnessed murders , and that students suddenly disappeared after they suffered severe beatings at the school , in @entity42 , @entity1 , in the 1950s and ' 60s			1
the men believed the graves , marked only by white steel crosses that are rusting with time , were those of the teens who were beaten and killed by reform school workers and administrators			1
but authorities found documents that pointed to the fire and the flu outbreak			1
they said they plan no exhumations			2
" this is our conclusion , based on what we know today , " said @entity57 , the chief of investigations for the @entity25			0
" enough information has been corroborated on who is buried there			0
we went and identified all of the individuals who perished while in custody , " he said			0
the @entity25 released its results in an 18 - page investigative report			0
it says that no information confirms that any of the administrators or workers at the facility contributed to the deaths of any of the students			0
their investigation into the charges of physical abuse , made by the former reform school students , continues			1
however , the investigators concluded that claims by the former students of slayings and disappearances of boys could not be corroborated			2
" none of the former students were able to provide any first - hand information which would have identified any of these alleged victims , or the persons responsible for their purported demise , " the report states @entity95 is one of the former students who pushed for the investigation			2
he 's written a book on the alleged abuse at the school and says that the @entity25 has yet to contact him , despite , he says , witnessing two deaths at the school			2
" my personal feeling is that the @entity1 does not want to know the truth			0
it is just too horrible a tragedy for the general public to learn about , " he wrote in an e-mail to @entity2			0
@entity1 's governor , @entity110 , had ordered an investigation to determine who is buried in the 31 unnamed graves			1
the graves are in a secluded area on the property of what was the @entity118 in @entity42 , a town near the @entity120 border			1
the @entity25 says that records have determined that the cemetery was known to everyone back in the early 1900s , and the details got lost in time			0
" there was enough information available to establish their identities and the cause of death , " said @entity57 of the @entity25			0
however , the @entity25 has not been able to determine why the graves are not marked with headstones or any other identifiers			0
" that 's the million - dollar question			0
we ca n't find any records why they were n't marked , " he said			0
but records have determined that the remains are those of boys who died in a fire at the reform school in 1914			1
many of these victims were orphans and indigents whose families could not afford to have the bodies shipped home			0
and so , the @entity25 said , they were buried at the school			2
others died in a flu epidemic , in about 1918			1
according to the @entity25 , among the remains are those of one reform school boy who was slain by another student			2
other graves are those of pets			0
the deaths were reported extensively in local news coverage , and even in a newsletter that was published , at the reform school , called " @entity162			2

@entity118 hit by 1914 fire , 1918 flu outbreak
