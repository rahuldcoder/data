-- one week before a potential government shutdown , @entity1 for the first time reacted positively to an offer from @entity5 republicans that would keep the government running for two more weeks while cutting $ 4 billion			1
" the plan the @entity5 are floating today sounds like a modified version of what @entity1 were talking about " in a proposal made to @entity5 thursday , said @entity7 , a spokesman for @entity9 majority leader @entity8 of @entity10			2
however , the @entity16 offer thursday was slightly different in that it was related to a longer - term spending bill that would last until october 1 , the beginning of the new fiscal year			0
for the short - term bill , @entity5 majority leader @entity20 , @entity21 , told reporters friday the $ 4 billion in spending cuts would come from terminating eight programs that president @entity27 included in his proposed 2012 budget and the elimination of earmarks , the same two areas @entity1 said thursday they were considering			1
among other cuts , the @entity5 plan targets $ 650 million in highway funds , $ 200 million in housing funds and $ 250 million for a reading program at the @entity36 and eliminates a literacy program at that department which the administration labeled " ineffective			2
" republicans said the cuts they are offering are intended to find common ground with @entity1			2
" these are things that people have agreed to already , " stressed @entity5 @entity5 whip @entity43			0
@entity1 have accused @entity5 of wanting indiscriminate budget cuts that would hit a wide swath of government programs -- something that would n't happen in this latest short - term proposal from the @entity5 because it is more targeted			1
" if they walk away from this offer they are actively engineering a government shutdown , " @entity5 deputy whip @entity51 told reporters in a conference call friday			0
" we are encouraged to hear that @entity5 are abandoning their demands for extreme measures like cuts to border security , cancer research and food safety inspectors and instead moving close to @entity65 's position that we should cut government spending in a smart , responsible way , " said @entity7 , the @entity8 's spokesman			1
the positive reaction from @entity1 elicited an equally positive response from @entity71 @entity70 who said , " there is now a clear path " to avoid a government shutdown			0
@entity5 @entity5 leaders said they are pushing ahead on the short term measure which would allow more time for the @entity5 and @entity9 to negotiate a longer term spending bill for the rest of the year			0
house speaker @entity80 said he expects the measure will pass the @entity5 early next week , effectively tossing the ball into the @entity9 's court			1
" i 'm hopeful senator @entity8 will quickly hold a vote on our short - term proposal so we can ensure the government remains open and that we 're addressing the need to cut spending , " @entity80 said .			0
