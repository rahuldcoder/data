-- biomedical research is complicated			2
for patients , the pace of progress can be frustratingly slow			0
two announcements last month -- one about biomarkers , the other about stem cell research -- left many of us feeling that for every promising discovery , there are even greater setbacks			1
we started august with good news about the discovery of an @entity17 's biological marker in spinal fluid that will allow earlier diagnosis of patients who are experiencing some memory loss			1
it may not sound sexy			0
but for @entity17 's patients and their loved ones , the significance of this finding is hard to overstate			1
biomarkers , which are substances or characteristics in our bodies that are associated with the risk or presence of disease , are critical tools in the quest for therapies that can slow or stop the progression of neurodegenerative diseases			2
until now , @entity17 's researchers , like those in the @entity41 's field , have not had the benefit of a biomarker to guide their discovery			1
this major breakthrough was the result of an unprecedented data sharing and collaboration			0
a consortium of scientists and executives across academia , government , industry , and the nonprofit world pooled their collective interests into one larger , collaborative platform , the @entity59 ( @entity59 )			0
in just six years -- a relatively short time in biomedical research -- they announced success			0
but with this one step forward came two steps backward two weeks ago when a @entity66 judge granted a preliminary injunction to halt federal funding for embryonic stem cell research			1
this ruling , which is even more restrictive than president @entity73 's stem cell research policies , goes against the beliefs of the majority of @entity66 ( in an august 2010 poll conducted by @entity77 , 70 percent of respondents said they favor expanded funding for stem cell research ) and wastes more precious time for the millions of people suffering from chronic diseases			1
as a person with @entity41 's , it 's hugely frustrating to think that one decision can actively hold back research that holds promise to transform lives			2
patients with neurodegenerative diseases dream of the day when disease - modifying treatments are found , instead of therapies that simply mask symptoms			0
disease - modifying therapies create the possibility of newly diagnosed patients never having to experience full - blown disease			0
the @entity99 has long championed the scientific freedom to pursue all promising paths to finding these treatments			0
biomarker discovery and stem cell science are among the innovative areas of biomedical research that hold potential to speed progress			1
so while our foundation gears up to launch its most ambitious biomarker discovery project to date , the @entity109 , with @entity59 as a precedent , we 'll also be standing with @entity41 's patients , their loved ones and the majority of @entity66 who want us to move beyond political agendas and advance the promise of stem cell research			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity122 .			2

@entity122 says august *brought* good news , *bad* news for research on chronic disease
he says new collaboration helped scientists find biomarker for @entity17 's
later , @entity134 ruled to stop fed funds for stem cell research , *bringing* programs to halt
@entity139 : @entity140 backs moving past politics , advancing stem cell research
