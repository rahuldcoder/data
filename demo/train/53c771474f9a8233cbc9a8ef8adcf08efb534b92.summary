a team of scientists has just finished what might literally be described as one of the most breathtaking jobs in the world -- surveying and mapping the coral reefs in @entity8 's @entity7 off the coast of @entity11 's @entity10			1
as part of the @entity17 , teams from the @entity13 , @entity11 's @entity14 and @entity11 's @entity15 spent time underwater over several weeks near the city of @entity20 to record data and map reefs in what the survey says " could become one of the last refuges on @entity27 for coral reefs			1
" the effort was part of a larger project to map the @entity7 , which encompasses 647 million hectares of land and sea located within the territories of @entity11 , @entity35 , the @entity36 , @entity37 , the @entity38 and @entity39			1
" @entity7 " refers to a roughly triangular shape of waters between the @entity43 and @entity44 oceans			2
one of the world 's most crucial breeding grounds for marine biodiversity , it 's home to 75 percent of all known coral species , including nearly 600 species of reef - building corals and 3,000 species of reef fish			1
the @entity17 says the scale of its undersea mapping project is unprecedented			0
located on the island of @entity10 , @entity20 is the capital of @entity11 's @entity10 province			0
coral devastation according to experts , about 40 percent of the world 's corals have been lost in the last three decades due to climate change and human activities			1
assuming the current rate of decline remains steady , some marine biologists predict that most of the world 's remaining coral will disappear by the middle of the century			1
the @entity17 got underway in september 2012 on @entity73 's @entity72			0
centering on the waters of @entity8 , the 2014 campaign commenced in april and has also covered areas around @entity77 and @entity78 in the @entity36 , @entity79 and @entity80 in @entity11 , and @entity39			0
located in the center of the @entity7 , @entity20 is a crucial section for researchers			1
" regions like @entity20 in the @entity7 could , by the middle of the century , be one of the only places on @entity27 where coral reefs will exist , " says @entity84 , chief scientist of the survey and director of the @entity87 at the @entity13			1
" understanding the structure and function of such reefs is of the utmost importance if we are to underpin their resilience to global change			2
" " this information is necessary to make informed decisions about how much , and where , governments should invest to ensure the future well being of our planet , " says @entity100 , chief executive of @entity101 , a @entity102 - based insurance company that sponsors the survey			0
how coral reef maps are made the coral mapping effort employs a @entity114 underwater camera , which has a rod and propeller attached to the back to create a sort of photo scooter			1
three digital slr cameras encased in the @entity114 's globe - shaped lens capture high resolution , 360 - degree images of reefs			2
designed by @entity17 , the camera 's new technology helps shorten surveying time of large , shallow water areas from months to days			2
@entity130 called the @entity131 : survey 4 , the survey around @entity20 , which concluded this week , covered up to 80 linear kilometers of reef , and comprised 40 two - kilometer transects			0
to map such a vast area , scientist - divers took photographs while " riding " the camera at an average depth of eight meters while traveling at 4 kph			2
thousands of images will eventually be stitched together to create a whole picture of the reef system			0
the images will be uploaded for viewing on the company 's database , the @entity146			0
some of the images can be found on @entity147			0
the team will begin mapping a section of the @entity7 in the @entity38 later this month .			0

the @entity7 is home to 75 percent of all known coral species in the world
researchers are using a special camera with a propeller attached to it to map the reefs
about 40 percent of the world 's corals have been lost in recent decades due to climate change and human activities
