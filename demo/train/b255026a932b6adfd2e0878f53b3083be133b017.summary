the @entity1 terrorist organization @entity0 has been active as a violent group since 2009 and in recent months has killed @entity3 , both @entity4 and @entity5 , at rates frequently exceeding a hundred people weekly			1
it is puzzling how little attention this has received in world media , especially in comparison to , say , the attack of @entity1 militants on the mall in @entity16 in september , resulting in 67 dead			1
that is , until now			0
the abduction of a reported 276 schoolgirls from @entity21 village in the northeastern @entity23 state has shocked people around the world			1
a deeper examination of @entity0 provides a revealing prism of the conflict in @entity3			1
@entity0 translates as " @entity30 education is sin			1
" rarely has the name of a terrorist organization revealed so much , but it does in ways beyond the surface interpretations sometimes portrayed in the media			0
in @entity0 , we see a total storm coming together : globalization has brought @entity30 ideas and imagery , especially around issues of women and sexuality , into the most patriarchal corners of the world			1
globalization , through @entity47 and broader interconnectedness , has facilitated and favored global ideologies , including globalized versions of @entity52 , some of which are extremist			0
@entity54 : @entity0 kidnaps a nation new media have shined a light on poor governance , including that of the corrupt @entity3 government			1
the impact of @entity52 , actively promoted by @entity62 and @entity63 , has had such an impact that in northern @entity3 , even @entity66 street signs and @entity68 dress are seen together with @entity62 - funded mosques			1
but @entity0 's rise is not only driven by global trends in themselves but by how globalization has melded with the internal dynamics of @entity3 education			1
the @entity75 in @entity3 is much more prosperous than the @entity76 , and that economic gap is growing rapidly			2
the roots go back to the @entity80 colonial period from the late 19th century to independence in 1960			0
the @entity80 ruled the @entity82 directly , which was also being rapidly christianized by missionaries			0
missionaries ran many of the schools			0
@entity87 : kidnapped girls are ' my sisters ' in the @entity76 , the @entity80 practiced " indirect rule , " governing through the clerical and traditional elites and allowing local religious institutions to operate autonomously ( with some limitations , for example , banning slavery )			0
the impact of missionary schooling was to bring @entity30 education into @entity3 , and this has had direct bearing on economic development for the regions where such schools predominated -- and this legacy is with us to this day			1
access to @entity30 - style education has been key for enabling people to adapt to a modern economy			1
in the north , some missionary schools were established , but traditional elites always resisted them for obvious religious reasons and because those schools threatened to generate an alternative elite			2
instead , the schooling that predominates in the north of @entity3 consists of religious schools , or the @entity120 education system -- often informal , with students congregating under a tree			1
these students are completely unequipped to work in a changing economy ( and overall , @entity3 is economically growing rapidly )			2
some of these schools have dubious teachers who exploit the usually impoverished students by getting them to beg in the streets for the teachers ' own gain			0
@entity132 : ' we ca n't let this be the new normal ' in the wake of september 11 , there was extensive discussion of @entity5 schools and the extent to which some were inculcating extremism , for example madrassas in @entity142			0
some have claimed that @entity5 education , properly taught , would provide an inoculation against extremism			0
but that debate lost sight of a larger issue , whatever the theology of such schools			0
the graduates of those schools are often adrift in globalized economies without marketable skills and modern education , and more vulnerable to at least tolerating extremism			1
which brings us back to the language of @entity0			2
the leadership has ranted against any form of secular education			0
it teaches that @entity166 colonists introduced modern secular education into @entity169 societies in a conspiracy to maintain colonialist hegemony over @entity5 societies : the @entity173 aims to corrupt pure @entity169 morals with liberal norms			2
likewise , the leaders believe that the @entity173 wants to replace proper gender roles with sexual permissiveness			0
secular subjects like chemistry , physics , engineering , meteorological explanations of rain , the theory of evolution are all denounced as contrary to the @entity188			0
in our research in the area , and in other surveys , it is evident that students coming out of the religious schools are more likely to sympathize with @entity0 , significantly even those who are not particularly religious in practice			2
equally significantly , religiosity as such does not necessarily bring with it a tendency to back @entity0			2
the issue is the education system , not religious belief			0
in the eyes of @entity0 , the abduction of schoolgirls is a triple strike against what they view as @entity30 depravity : against @entity30 schools , against " the obscenity " of having girls in school at all and against @entity215 , to the degree the schoolgirls are @entity4			1
if northern @entity3 is to have a more stable and prosperous long - term future , it is essential to develop an education system that prepares students for a modern , globalized economy			1
this is especially the case in the northeast , where @entity0 is most active			2
nigerians in northeastern @entity3 , who in part may sympathize with @entity0 's fight against corruption , are however alienated by @entity0 's bloodlust			1
and most will support developing an education system that provides the foundation to make a living .			0

@entity0 has killed hundreds of @entity3 each month
*authors* : kidnapping of schoolgirls brought world 's attention to the terror group
they say it is *fueled* by a *reaction* in impoverished north to @entity30 education , values
backward schooling must yield to education that teaches marketable skills , they say
