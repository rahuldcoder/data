-- at this point in my life , at the wizened age of 69 , i 've managed to run 123 marathons -- and i 'm happy to say i 'm still going strong			1
but things could have turned out differently for me			0
in fact , my first marathon was almost my last			1
i was a pretty strong runner but had never really attempted that kind of distance before			1
a friend of mine challenged me to give the @entity14 a try			0
i was young , cocky and pretty stupid			0
i trained only sporadically , went out way too fast at the start of the race and spent the last 10 miles feeling like i was going to die			0
by the time i finished , i had vowed never to run another marathon again -- and promptly ran my second one the following year , because i could n't resist the challenge of overcoming my mistakes and my conviction that i could do better			1
aside from being frustrated and overwhelmed , i easily could 've injured myself , which would have put an end to my running completely			1
of course , my problems all started with not training properly , and if you 're serious about running , your first marathon training is key			1
but there are a million good training schedules out there , and at this point you 've probably seen most of them			1
what i 'd like to talk about is what you can do during the race to ensure your success -- not just so that you finish , but that you feel reasonably good doing it			2
good enough that you 'll be back for more			2
here are five things i 've learned since that first miserable experience : 1			0
pacing as i learned that first day , pacing is critical			0
start slower than you think you need to go -- that initial adrenaline rush will make you want to go out at a sprint , but that will only drain you for the rest of the race			0
bonus : a good way to figure out a healthy pace for your first marathon is to run a @entity56 at least a month in advance			1
take your @entity56 time and multiply it by five			1
that should give you a pretty accurate predictor for your marathon time			1
so if you run a 55 - minute @entity56 , shoot for a 4:35 marathon ( 275 minutes )			1
walking mixing walking with running is a great way to get through a marathon and still feel strong doing it			1
at each water station , try walking for 30 to 60 seconds			2
there usually is a water station at each mile			0
you 'll conserve your energy , and your finish time will actually improve			2
talking i know this sounds crazy , but talking to other runners during a race can be really helpful			0
keeping your mind off the pain is important , and engaging in conversation is a great way to do that			0
if you 're too out of breath to talk , you 're running too fast			2
listening to music is another good way to stay focused , but in my experience is far less interesting			1
stretching stretching and warming up before a race is really important for preventing injury			0
there are many good stretching guides available on the @entity93			2
i also highly recommend yoga			0
of course , you ca n't do yoga during a race , but try to fit in one to two hours a week during training			2
positions like warrior pose or down dog increase strength and flexibility in your entire core , and running a marathon is n't just about your legs -- it 's about your whole body			1
experimenting do n't do it ! this sounds like common sense , but you do n't know how many runners i 've talked to who get a brilliant idea to try something completely different on the day of a marathon -- be it new shoes , socks , drinks or energy gels			2
for the big race , stick with the rituals and gear you know and trust			0
save the new stuff for something easy , like a @entity132			0
happy running ! stick with it , and i 'll see you in @entity137 .			0

training is key when preparing for your first marathon , runner says
mixing walking and running is a good way to stay strong to the end
@entity149 recommends multiplying your @entity56 pace by 5 to get your goal time
