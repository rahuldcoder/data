" @entity0 , a local @entity3 camel farmer is staring at me as though i 've offended him			1
i 'm midway through a luxurious sand safari exploring the deserts of @entity7 , and @entity0 has been chatting to me over a traditional @entity9 breakfast of cardamom - scented crepes slathered in date honey			1
i 've asked him how he 's been affected by @entity7 's transformation from desert outpost to international city in the space of 25 years , and now i 'm bracing myself for a lecture on the blight of modernity and how materialists like me are tainting his land			1
" my grandfather had a tent and a camel ... " he pauses and raises his graying eyebrows at me , then his face crinkles into a sun - beaten smile			1
" and i have a five - bedroom villa with @entity29 , and a race horse ! do you think i do n't like that ? " turns out he 's a happy man			1
@entity7 's @entity3 are no longer dusty nomads searching for a home -- they 're now a part of the emirate 's modern landscape of glamorous golf estates , tall towers , shopping malls and theme parks			1
despite appearances , their history and natural culture can still be explored , as i discovered a day earlier when i joined the @entity47 safari team at the edge of the @entity49			1
@entity51 desert the platinum part of this safari refers to the @entity49 , @entity7 's most pristine desert , but could also refer to the five - star treatment we receive while exploring it			1
the heritage ? open - top @entity60 from the 1950s , bumblebee yellow or racing green , older than the unified country they 're driving across , wheels like concrete , sounding like lawn mowers			1
before we set off , @entity67 , our @entity69 mirror aviator - shaded driver , brought out some black and white keffiye headscarves			1
as we wrapped ourselves under instruction , i cringed on the inside -- who does n't feel like a charlatan in another culture 's national dress ? -- but soon found out how necessary they were			2
when the cars pick up speed they throw up sand and the tail of the headscarf can be pulled over to give faces protection from the grit			2
there was to be no " dune bashing " on this trip , explained @entity67			1
apart from the obvious incompatibility with these classic cars , it can be devastating to the desert eco-system			0
it kills off sensitive environments for animals living under ground , which make up 95 % of the land fauna found in the natural areas of @entity7			1
we weaved gently over dunes and stopped at various points for photographs			2
in some , the sands were golden , bare and desolate , scattered with the bones of petrified trees , disappearing in waves to the horizon			0
in other areas sands were tawny , shaded by giant ghaf trees and @entity113 gums , with scrub protecting the tiny animals dwelling there			0
aerial acrobatics at one meager watering hole , delicate gazelles and lumbering oryx waited on the perimeter			2
they were n't camera shy , but they would n't return until we left			0
later we were driven to a higher point where carpets were arranged on the sand before a natural amphitheater			2
falcons waited on a roost , hooded but untethered			0
@entity132 the @entity133 ( named after the local power company whose lines this lazy bird likes to sit on ) and @entity138 , a barbary falcon , put on a show with their trainer as the sun disappeared over the city lights of distant @entity7			1
the birds never touched us , but beat our heads with bursts of air as they swooped close enough to make us squeal			0
at dusk we entered our camp for the night -- a stone - ringed compound established by @entity150 , and provided to @entity47 on the proviso that they provide a genuine insight to @entity9 culture			1
we talked with the few other passengers and drivers over dates and gahwa ( @entity158 coffee ) , before the ouzi ( spiced , whole roasted lamb ) was brought from its charcoal pit			0
in desert silence we ate traditional food , delicious and exotic -- even to me , a longtime resident of @entity7			1
as lgeimats ( addictive little @entity9 donuts ) were brought out , we were entertained with traditional @entity170 dances in which women sway their long , black hair , and @entity173 , in which men tap rhythms with camel canes			2
we smoked shisha seated on rugs around a bonfire until the desert chill sent us to bed in our camelhair tent nearby			0
scary driving the @entity47 experience is different from many desert safaris on offer			1
the others range in the details and intensity , but the formula is usually the same -- pickup in a white @entity193 , travel in convoy to the edge of the desert where tires are deflated for traction in the sand			2
drivers proceed to scare the wits out of tourists by throwing the cars over dunes in a way i 'm sure @entity208 would revoke their warranties for			2
i once took a @entity211 camera on one of these drives			0
all the footage i got was sand and sky , glimpses of the interior of the car and howls of a freaked out @entity221 in the back seat , a broken record of " no , no , no , no , no , no , nooooooo ! " punctuated by an occasional squeak or the sound of someone gagging			2
some of these safaris then round off the terror with disappointment -- an evening in a fenced compound filled with camels and quad bikes , a low quality buffet , beers and a belly dancer from @entity236			0
i 've been on too many of these , not realizing what i was really missing out on until now			0
the morning brings both sunshine and a clear head			0
the cold breeze of the night has cleaned the sands , leaving only the prints of mystery desert fauna			0
@entity0 laughs and chatters as if we 're family , welcoming us into a culture that remains hidden for so many visitors to the @entity9			0
he shows us that it 's there for anyone to find , they just need to know where to look			0
how to explore the sands @entity47 offers a range of safari options , including the vintage @entity60 tours , private night safaris , dinner safaris , camel safaris , wildlife drives and @entity3 breakfasts and falconry experiences			1
if dune bashing and belly dancing are more your thing , @entity264 is the largest operator			1
those who prefer to do the driving themselves should get in touch with @entity273 , which runs half - day desert driving courses			0
@entity276 offers the nature without the adventure , but with a whole lot of luxury			0
the resort is connected to the @entity49 and has gazelles and oryx wandering free within its grounds			0
prices start at about 6,000 aed ( $ 1,600 ) per room per night .			0
