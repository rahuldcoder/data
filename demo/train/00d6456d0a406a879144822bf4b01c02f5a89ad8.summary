-- @entity2 's alternative search engine -- a $ 24 million venture - backed project that 's been three years in the making -- is today launching its public beta			1
with the official rollout , @entity2 is also releasing several new features designed for both mainstream and the site 's super users			1
as you may recall , @entity2 is designed to eliminate spam search results , allowing users to search just a subset of the web through its proprietary slashtag technology			1
the most significant upgrade to @entity2 's search engine is the addition of slashtags that auto - fire for queries that fall into one seven categories : health , colleges , autos , personal finance , lyrics , recipes and hotels			1
every time a @entity2 user 's query is determined to be in one of these categories , @entity2 will automatically append the associated slashtag to the query and limit results to just the subset of urls that fall under that slashtag			2
the auto - fire functionality is designed with passive searchers in mind , and aims to eliminate friction for first time users			0
the technology that powers these auto - slashtags was developed through an extensive research and development phase that involved analyzing the relationship between queries and the type of spam results they typically generate			2
@entity2 plans to introduce auto - slashing for additional categories moving forward , but selected to launch with ones that represent a high volume of search traffic and are typically laden with spammy results			1
health , lyric and financial queries on @entity65 or @entity66 , for instance , will return results dominated by poor quality content farms or malware - hosting sites			0
those same searches on @entity2 yield results only from high quality sites			0
@entity2 's slashtag formula works because of passionate users who take the time to add and edit urls for category slashtags			1
as such , the company has released new features to enable users to apply to be editors for slashtags as well as share their comments and feedback on individual slashtags			0
think of this as the @entity87 formula but applied to search , so a small percentage of users will work together to build out slashtags for the majority of @entity2 searchers			2
@entity2 has been testing its solution to search with roughly 8,000 beta testers who have created more than 3,000 different slashtags			2
@entity2 tells us that 11 percent of its existing user base come back to the site on a weekly basis			0
ceo @entity102 and founder @entity103 have modest projections for the immediate future , but believe that once the site hits one to two million queries per day , it can be profitable			0
@entity2 is currently available on the web or as a mobile - optimized site , but mobile applications are also said to be in the works			0
