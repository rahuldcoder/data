-- i am covering the @entity2 for @entity3 this year , and , as such , it 's my job to know what happens at the @entity2 as soon as it happens			1
no waiting for the tape - delay broadcast for me ; i wake at 4 a.m. to watch archery and stay in front of the screen until the sun sets on the @entity12			2
what this means is that i have personally spoiled at least seven people 's enjoyment of the @entity2 by blabbing prematurely about who won what event			1
" did you see that @entity20 came in fourth ? " i ask			2
" no , you jerk , and thanks for ruining it for me			2
i was going to watch that tonight , " they respond			2
for this and myriad other moments of spoiler - related thoughtlessness , i heartily apologize			2
and in order to make amends , i hereby offer 10 tips on what to do and how to prepare if you want to avoid having the games spoiled by careless obsessives like me			1
opinion : is it really # @entity40 ? 1			2
the key to any good spoiler - avoidance strategy is practice			2
construct a training space in your basement or backyard , and prepare yourself for the challenges to come			2
see how long you can resist the urge to check your phone for swimming updates			1
practice walking with your fingers in your ears while shouting " i ca n't hear you ! i ca n't hear you ! " 2			0
fun fact : casual commuting is responsible for 75 percent of sports spoilers			1
when you 're walking along the street or sitting on a subway , you often ca n't avoid overhearing other people talking about the @entity2			1
so be sure to take the necessary precautions before you leave the house			0
map your route and follow it to the letter , making sure to gaze straight at the ground the entire way			0
some might recommend that you also don a heavy pair of earmuffs , but there 's no need for you to go outside looking like a freak			0
carrying around a portable white noise machine will be fine			1
your smartphone is your enemy during these next two weeks			1
if you carry it around , you will be tempted to check the @entity77 , and you risk receiving spoiler - laden text messages from your gymnastics - loving friends			1
switch to an older phone for the duration of the @entity2 , preferably one that is decades old , is shaped like a brick and has a wan green display that can handle neither text messages nor the @entity77			1
you could also take this opportunity to rediscover the joys of pre-cellular communication devices			0
bag up some quarters and see if you can still find a working payphone			0
fire up your old cb radio			0
( nobody on the cb radio is talking about the @entity2			1
they 're all talking about speed traps and convoys and such			0
) @entity98 takes the @entity2 gold for speed 4			1
streamline your social media feeds			1
you can probably divide your @entity104 friends into " people who are likely to follow the @entity2 " and " people who are not			1
" hide all status updates from the @entity2 - following friends			1
this should leave you with a @entity104 feed composed entirely of elderly relatives , local merchants and new mothers posting photographs of their children			0
abandon @entity98 entirely , or , at the very least , unfollow everyone except @entity117			0
implement and rigorously follow a household media blackout : no radio , no television , no newspapers , no @entity77 , no virtual reality devices			1
mollify your children by telling them it 's @entity125 , and promise a handsome prize to whichever child memorizes the most words			0
if your spouse complains , cut her off by shouting irrationally " who did you marry : me or @entity131 ? ! it 's like i do n't even know you anymore ! " if a full - fledged media blackout is n't feasible , then at least limit yourself to the stations that are least likely to air anything having to do with modern times : the radio stations that play big band music and old - timey radio programs			0
on television , the tv stations that specialize in old reruns of " @entity143			0
your friends and family are likely to try to spoil the @entity2 results for you			1
thus , it is critical that you do your best to alienate them for the duration of the @entity2			1
avoid bathing and repel them with your hideous smell ; refuse to answer their phone calls , e-mail messages or direct questions			1
if they start talking about @entity159 , cut them off immediately with a brusque " i do n't want to hear anybody talking about the @entity2			1
my grandfather died in a @entity163 ! " 7			0
the office is bound to be a prime place for @entity2 spoilers			1
stay away from the water cooler ; go thirsty if you must			0
arrive 10 minutes late for every meeting , to avoid any obnoxious spoiler - laden pre-meeting chatter			2
take the stairs instead of the elevator ; it 's better to be a bit winded than to risk picking up untimely information on those stupid elevator televisions they have			2
really , the best thing is to just not go to work for a couple of weeks			2
now 's the time to cash in those " @entity2 days " you 've been saving up			1
jobs give their workers @entity2 days , right ? day 4 : the best photos of the @entity2 8			1
do n't go to the gym , either , because the gym is filled with armchair olympians who like nothing more than to discuss the day 's sporting events			2
do your exercising outdoors , instead			0
if you must visit the gym , be sure to only use the unpopular equipment , like jump ropes and medicine balls			0
and , for goodness sake , stay away from bars , because bars are a prime location for loose - lipped sports talkers			0
instead , you should drink alone at home			0
if you find yourself craving the tavern experience , all you need is some plywood , a few milk crates and a couple of cases of @entity207 , and , presto , you 'll have your own makeshift wet bar			0
( home improvement projects are easy ! ) 9			0
if you are handy , you might consider building a @entity210 , like they used in the tv show " @entity212			0
" this is basically just a hard plastic fishbowl that you wear over your head			0
( this will certainly stop you from hearing any spoilers , but also , if you wear it , you may asphyxiate			2
you know where nobody 's talking about the @entity2 ? in the forest			1
take these next two weeks as an opportunity to go back to nature			0
pitch a tent in the woods , and commune with the stars and the seedlings			0
bring a battery - powered television that gets only three channels , and fire it up every night around 7			0
you 'll be able to watch the key moments of the @entity2 in peace and quiet			1
and , despite what you 've heard , it is quite unlikely that you 'll be eaten by a bear			0
