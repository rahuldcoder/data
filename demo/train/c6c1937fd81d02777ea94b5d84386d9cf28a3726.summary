-- a @entity2 judge ruled this week that several of the state 's teacher tenure , dismissal and layoff laws are unconstitutional			1
the decision sparked a nationwide debate , as the case gets at one of this country 's core questions : what 's the best way to educate children ? on one side of the debate are teachers and unions , which say tenure 's job protections provide stability , and creative and academic freedoms			1
on the other side , some administrators and others argue such protections give bad teachers a free ride at the expense of students -- particularly poor students and students of color			1
somewhere in the middle of the debate are politicians and educators who 've seized on the judge 's ruling as a call to action to fix a broken public teaching system			1
" at the end of the day what everyone has common interest in -- the common goal -- is to increase public confidence in public education			0
we want great public schools and we need great public school teachers , " education secretary @entity49 told @entity0			1
" there 's one common enemy and that 's academic failure -- and if we continue to fight silly fights everybody loses			1
" here 's a look at what the @entity2 ruling could mean : ... for teachers teachers in the country 's most populous state are evaluated for tenure in less than two years -- a law the judge found to be unconstitutional			1
" great teachers absolutely deserve to have their jobs protected ... but it 's a ridiculously short period of time , " said @entity69 , superintendent of the @entity70			1
he suggested evaluating teachers after 3 - 5 years			1
" allow us to have a period of time to work and support teachers before we make this important decision , and then celebrate that decision , " @entity69 said			1
for their part , unions are n't necessarily against the idea of delaying tenure decisions , but they have criticized the judge for tossing the good along with the bad			1
they warn the ruling could have a cooling effect on teachers , nationwide , who want to experiment in the classroom			1
" the judge should not have thrown out the rights of every teacher , because good teachers need to be creative			1
they need to take risks			0
they need to actually do things where they may stumble and fall , " said @entity96 , president of the @entity97			0
" but what this decision did is ( it ) said to teachers all across the country , ' do n't speak up anymore -- do n't try new things			1
' " ... for students in his ruling , @entity109 county judge @entity108 cited evidence that , he wrote , " shocks the conscience			1
" he discussed experts called in the case who testified about the scope and significance of bad teachers			1
between 1 - 3 % of teachers in @entity2 are " grossly ineffective , " he wrote , which translates into an actual number of teachers of between 2,750 - 8,250			1
a single year with a " grossly ineffective teacher costs students $ 1.4 million in lifetime earnings per classroom , " @entity108 said			1
the judge also found fault with the price of getting rid of bad teachers , saying the process could take up to 10 years and cost between $ 50,000 - $ 450,000			1
clearly , students win if bad teachers are replaced with great ones			1
and no one is arguing in favor of protecting poor teachers			2
" if a teacher can not teach , they should be fired , effectively and quickly , " @entity96 said			0
but @entity141 -- a former @entity142 , schools chancellor -- argues that unions have lost sight of what 's most important in the classroom			1
@entity141 is a supporter of @entity147 , the nonprofit that helped nine students file the case in @entity2			2
" the union 's job is to protect the rights , privileges , and pay of their members			1
they want their members to be able to keep their jobs regardless , and what this judge is saying is that we have to look out for the interests of children , first and foremost -- that we have to ensure that there 's a high quality teacher in front of every child every single day , " @entity141 said			2
... for parents @entity168 is a father of five in @entity169 , @entity2			0
one child is in college ; the rest are in public schools			0
@entity168 was pleased by the judge 's ruling this week and likes that it has sparked a conversation about education			2
he paid close attention to the " last in , first out " policy , another one of the laws @entity108 found to be unconstitutional			0
" no matter how gifted the junior teacher , and no matter how grossly ineffective the senior teacher , the junior gifted one , who all parties agree is creating a positive atmosphere for his / her students , is separated from them and a senior grossly ineffective one who all parties agree is harming the students entrusted to her / him is left in place , " the judge wrote			2
@entity168 , who works in the tech community , similarly believes the policy is indefensible			0
" we 're big believers in a meritocracy , " he said			0
" having an education system that 's counter to that -- where time and place is rewarded versus performance -- is not something that 's consistent with the way we look at the world			2
" the flip side of a meritocracy , however -- @entity168 said -- is the need for greater compensation for the teachers doing a great job			1
" people have to be rewarded for innovation , rewarded for efforts to make the classroom a better environment			0
we ca n't just remove ( job ) security and do n't do anything else , " he said			2
it was a point that secretary @entity49 also made			1
" no teacher ever goes into education to make a million dollars			0
teachers are the most altruistic people you 're ever going to meet , " he said			2
" we need to recognize and reward the talent that is changing students ' lives every single day			2
" ... and for the rest of the country in many ways , the @entity2 case is unique and can not be easily replicated in others states			0
for one , @entity2 is an outlier when it comes to teacher tenure			2
in his decision , judge @entity108 wrote that 32 states have a three - year evaluation period , while nine states have a four - or five - year period			0
@entity2 is one of only five states with a period of two years or less , he wrote			0
the state is also an outlier when it comes to the policy of " last in , first out			0
" twenty states allow for seniority to be considered among other factors , and 19 leave the layoff criteria to district discretion , @entity108 wrote , stressing that @entity2 is just one of 10 states that say seniority can be the sole factor in a layoff decision , or that it must be considered			0
the judge based his decision on the @entity263 , which could also complicate efforts to take the case to other states			0
still , @entity267 , a spokesman for @entity268 , says that 's exactly what the group is looking to do			2
conversations are happening in a dozen states with stakeholders interested in pursuing litigation , he said , mentioning @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 , in particular			0
" we 're weighing : 1 ) do you have these laws at all ? 2 ) what 's the constitutional framework ? 3 ) is there evidence that the laws are n't working ? " @entity267 said			2
his group 's success in other states will ultimately depend on how the @entity2 case holds up under appeal			0
the judge has ordered a stay of his decision , pending such an appeal			0
but in @entity2 , some educators say they do n't want to wait			0
" i hope what happens is that we form a coalition of strong labor leaders and our legislators and immediately get to rewriting laws that are just and legal , " said @entity69 , with the @entity70			0
" these laws have been found to be unconstitutional			0
i think that it 's incumbent upon us to work as quickly as possible			0
" @entity0 's @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 and @entity309 contributed to this report .			0

unions say tenure 's job protections provide stability and necessary freedoms
other argue such protections give bad teachers a free ride at the expense of students
