-- @entity1 held her 77 - year - old father , who had collapsed outside in a @entity4 street			1
a passerby rushed across the street to bang on the door of a fire station , knowing that firefighters are trained to provide emergency medical help			1
but they would n't leave the station			1
the same thing happened when two more people tried to summon the firefighters for assistance , @entity1 says			1
" we looked across the street at the fire station			1
there was a firefighter that was actually standing against the fire apparatus , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity21			1
" everybody started trying to wave him over			2
" but the firefighter said he had to be dispatched first			1
" i even ran to the curb and said , ' are you going to help me or let my dad die ? ' " said @entity1			1
later , after an ambulance finally arrived , @entity31 died at a hospital			2
he had suffered an apparent heart attack			2
an investigation is under way and , so far , no officials are publicly challenging @entity1 ' version of events			1
" it 's an outrage , " @entity4 mayor @entity40 said at a news conference			2
" i was absolutely furious			2
" he said he apologized to @entity1 for " what appeared to be dereliction , " @entity4 news station @entity44 reported			1
" those who failed to respond as they should -- they will be held accountable , period , " @entity40 vowed			0
in comments thursday to @entity0 , @entity40 said he has " taken a lot of time with it			0
" the investigation is " being done as rapidly as we possibly can , " he added			0
the @entity57 and @entity58 told @entity0 it is investigating the incident , which took place along the 1300 block of @entity62 on saturday			0
" our duty is to respond to all requests for emergency assistance			0
if it is determined that proper protocols were not followed at the conclusion of our investigation , then appropriate action will be taken , " spokesman @entity66 said			1
the protocol is in question because , according to the @entity1 family , those who asked for help at the fire station were told to call 911			1
calls to 911 were placed , but a mix - up with the address delayed an ambulance , said @entity84 member @entity83			0
" two things happened , " he said			0
" one was that no one came out of the fire house to help this gentleman			0
the other is the ambulance that was dispatched was dispatched to the wrong place			1
this was a number of fiascos			0
" @entity95 , deputy mayor for public safety , said a " very new , probationary employee " was at the facility			1
the employee 's first response should be " to ask a senior person , and we believe that was done , " he said , according to @entity44			1
" the question now is what did that senior person say ? what did that person do ? did they follow protocols and procedures ? " there are no protocols that would prevent fire personnel from helping those in need , @entity95 told @entity0 thursday			0
" these are people who run into burning buildings			1
they work in the most hazardous conditions imaginable			0
" they cross the streets , they cross highways to get to people			2
this is why it is so troubling that we did not take the appropriate action in this case			0
it 's right across the street			0
" " it 's hard to get your arms around " the idea that this took place , he added			0
lt. @entity139 was the officer in charge of the station at the time of the incident , @entity44 reports			2
@entity139 did not respond immediately to an e-mail thursday from @entity0 , and a call to a phone number listed for her was not answered			0
also thursday , a spokesman said that two employees of the @entity57 and @entity58 have been suspended with pay in the wake of the incident			1
" i can not say who they were because it is a personnel matter and an ongoing investigation , but i can tell you that neither of them was the probationary firefighter involved in the incident , " said @entity153 , with the office of the deputy mayor for public safety			2
the employees were working at the station , he said			1
@entity31 , a lifelong @entity4 resident , worked for the @entity167			0
his daughter , in mourning , had kind words for the mayor 's handling of the matter			2
" i appreciate how seriously he is taking this because it never should have happened , " she told @entity44			0
@entity1 was n't immediately available thursday when contacted by @entity0			1
the firefighters ' union said the incident simply should never have happened			2
" we need to find out why it did occur and make sure it never happens again , " said @entity179 , president of the @entity180 , in a statement reported by @entity44			0
